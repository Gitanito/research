Introductory.\nMy knowledge of Mrs. Piper began early in May, 1887, about a\nfortnight after my arrival in Boston. Professor William James men\ntioned her to me, and appointed an hour, without, of course, mentioning\nmy name, at which Mrs. Piper could give me a sitting. Mrs. Piper,\nhowever, was engaged at the tune I called, and could see me only to\narrange for a sitting a day or two later. As my readers know, from the\narticle in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., pp. 436-650, Mrs. Piper passes\ninto the so-called \"mediumistic trance,\" and then usually purports to be\n\" controlled \" by a \" Doctor Phinuit.\" For convenience of reference I\nshall speak of \" Phinuit \"as a distinct personality, and consider later\nsome points that bear on the probability or improbability that Phinuit\nis an intelligence entirely separate from the individuality of Mrs. Piper.\nAfter I had had several sittings I informed Mrs. Piper of my name\nand address, dec, for convenience in arranging sittings\u2014either for\nmyself or for other persons\u2014and I estimate that I have made appoint\nments for at least fifty persons whom I believed to be strangers to Mrs.\nPiper. At one time I arranged with Mrs. Piper that she should give\nme the first hour on three mornings of the week for several successive\nweeks, and I sent persons at these times to keep the appointment,\nusually warning them not to speak of their intended visit even in the\npresence of their nearest relatives, while Mrs. Piper knew simply that\neither myself or some person deputed by me would fill each engagement.\nOn a few occasions I accompanied the sitters and took notes of the\nsittings.\nSeveral times Mrs. Piper was unable to go into trance at all. At\nother times the attempts of Phinuit to give information to the sitters.\n\f2 Mr. R. Hothjson.\nwere not only unsatisfactory, but were calculated to produce the opinion\nthat he had no supernormal faculty whatever, but was \" fishing \" and\n\" shuffling \" like any ordinary pseudo-medium, and this opinion was\nproduced in some of the sitters, who regarded Mrs. Piper as probably\nfraudulent. Others again believed themselves to be, through Phinuit,\nactually conversing with their deceased friends, while others regarded\nthe communications as explicable on the hypothesis that Mrs. Piper\nin her trance state possesses the power of getting glimpses into the\nsitter's past experiences, or, to use the phrase of one sitter, of \" fingering\nin the wastepaper basket of our memories.\" These sittings, therefore,\nwere very much of the same character as those already reported in\nVol. VI. of our Proceedings. Much interest was aroused by these\npreliminary inquiries, which I conducted for my own personal satisfac\ntion, and finally, in 1888, a serious attempt was made by the Com\nmittee on Mediumistic Phenomena (appointed by the Council of the\nAmerican Society for Psychical Research) to investigate Mrs. Piper,\nand I extract the following from the Report of the Committee (Pro\nceedings of the American Societyfor Psychical Research, p. 320) :\u2014\n\" During the year the committee, as such, has undertaken the careful\nexamination of the results obtained by one well-known trance medium, who\nis reported to have given to many prudent sitters nanies and communications\nof such accuracy and fulness that it is supposed that such results could only\nbe reached by some occult agency, or by some mental process which is not\nexactly recognised as yet. The committee was of the opinion that the reality\nof such phenomena could probably be satisfactorily determined by a series of\nsittings held with suitable sitters under the personal supervision of a member\nof the committee and stenographically reported. In this plan we were aided\nvery materially by the generous co-operation of the medium, who expressed\nherself ready and willing to act with us in our work. Thus far we have been\nable to have only eight or ten sittings in which the desired conditions were\nreasonably fulfilled. The results thus obtained are not of such a character as\nto warrant any very decided judgment as tii the nature of the phenomena\nunder examination, but they throw some light on the questions involved.\"\nThis special investigation ended owing to lack of funds. The com\nmittee regarded the stenographic reports as essential, and these were\nexpensive.\nI had the opportunity of studying the stenographic reports men\ntioned in the above extract, and also the comments of the sitter and of\nthe member of the committee in each case. I have also in my posses\nsion several stenographic reports of sittings made at the instance of\nProfessor James previous to my arrival in America. In addition I have\nhad sittings for the purpose of testing Phinuit's capacities in various\nways, and among them a series of sittings which Mrs. Piper gave\ngratuitously, for the purpose of enabling me to find out what I could\nfrom Phinuit, in any way that I chose, concerning his own personality,\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance.\nhis knowledge, his relations to Mrs. Piper, &e. This series of sittings last\nreferred to, of which the circumstances at the time permitted me to have\nonly five, were stenographically reported, also gratuitously, by a lady\nmember of our Society who had had frequent sittings with Mrs. Piper,\nand was well known to the Phinuit personality. Furthermore, I have\nreceived oral accounts from a large number of persons, some of whom\nhave had frequent sittings with Mrs. Piper for several years, indepen\ndently of my arrangements. I have before me also the reports of Mrs.\nPiper's sittings in England. Mrs. Piper, throughout all my acquaint\nance with her, has shown the fullest readiness to accept my suggestions\nin any way whatever for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the\nPhinuit personality, and both she and Phinuit gave me full permission\nto try and test in any way that I might think desirable. As my investi\ngations have proceeded I have been more and more strengthened in the\nconviction that Mrs. Piper's trance is a genuine abnormal state, and\nthat the normal waking Mrs. Piper has no direct knowledge whatever\nof the sayings and doings of her trance personality. That she exhibits\nsupernormal phenomena in the trance state I have no doubt. In brief,\nI find myself in entire agreement with the formal summary report pre\nsented by Professor Lodge in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 443,\nwhich ran, it will be'remembered, as follows :\u2014\n\"It is the case of a lady who appears to go off into a trance when she\npleases to will it under favourable surroundings, and in that trance to talk\nvolubly, with a manner and voice quite different from her ordinary manner\nand voice, on details concerning which she has had no information given her.\n\" In this abnormal state her speech has reference mainly to people's\nrelatives and friends, living or deceased, about whom she is able to hold a\nconversation, and with whom she appears more or less familiar.\n\" By introducing anonymous strangers, and by catechising her myself in\nvarious ways, I have satisfied myself that much of the information she\npossesses in the trance state is not acquired by ordinary commonplace\nmethods, but that she has some unusual means of acquiring information.\nThe facts on which she discourses are usually within the knowledge of some\nperson present, though they are often entirely out of his conscious thought\nat the time. Occasionally facts have been narrated which have only been\nverified afterwards, and which are in good faith asserted never to have been\nknown ; meaning thereby that they have left no trace on the conscious\nmemory of any person present or in the neighbourhood, and that it is highly\nimprobable that they were ever known to such persons.\n\" She is also in the trance state able to diagnose diseases and to specify\nthe owners or late owners of portable property, under circumstances which\npreclude the application of ordinary methods.\n\" In the midst of this lucidity a number of mistaken and confused\nstatements are frequently made, having little or no apparent meaning or\napplication.\n\" Concerning the particular means by which she acquires the different\nB 2\n\f4 Mr. R. Hodyson.\nkinds of information, there is no sufficient evidence to make it safe to draw\nany conclusion. I can only say with certainty that it is by none of the\nordinary methods known to Physical Science.\"\n\u00a7 2. Some Peculiarities of the Trance State.\nMrs. Piper seems, so far as my experiments have gone, to be partially\namesthetic in the medium-trance. Professor James tells me that on one\noccasion he found the lips and tongue analgesic. Phinuit claims to\nhave neither taste nor smell, and I was unable to get any indications of\nthem. Once, however, when I was testing Phinuit's knowledge of herbs\n(see below, p. 51), Mrs. Blodgett was present and tasted one of the\nspecimens, whereupon Phinuit put a portion in his mouth, but in reply\nto my inquiry said that he could not taste it. Phinuit claimed to get\nno sensations of smell from a scent-bag or a bottle of perfume,\u2014at\nwhich I was not surprised, since, on a previous occasion, I could not\ndetect the smallest signs of discomfort1 after he had taken several\ninhalations of strong ammonia. I took special care to see that the\nammonia was actually inhaled. Similarly he appeared to be quite un\naware of a spoonful of salt which I placed in his mouth. Dr. C. W. F.\nstates (see below, Reports of Sittings, No. 23) that the sense of taste\nwas in the forehead, but the single incident upon which he founded this\nopinion is capable of another explanation. Dr. F. writes to me :\u2014\n\"February 16th, 1891.\n\"At my first seance with Mrs. Piper, Phinuit said, 'Get the medium to\ncut off a lock of your hair for me to examine and then prescribe some\nmedicine for you.' This was done and the medicine sent to me, and I took it\nfor a time, and thought it soothed the bladder. I put a small vial of it in my\npocket before visiting Mrs. Piper again, as I wished Phinuit to tell me what\nit was. I took it from my pocket during the trance and handed it to her,\nwhen she removed the cork and wetted her finger either from the cork or\nvial and placed it to her forehead. Phinuit remarked that it was all right,\ncorrectly prepared. It contained, among other things, uva ursi and wild\ncarrot. I now remember asking him the question, ' Why was it necessary\nfor you to have a lock of my hair to examine before prescribing for me when\nyou had mo right before you ? ' His answer was to the effect that the\nmedicine might be examined by him after its preparation to see that it was\nall right. He then instanced a case he prescribed for where a wrong salt was\nused by the apothecary to the injury of the lady having the seance. I made\nno further experiment as to the seat of the sense of taste.\"\nOn the other hand, Miss W. relates an incident that seems to bear\non this point (see p. 31), where Phinuit apparently went through the\nprocess of \" tasting,\" and suggested that Mrs. Piper had been eating\nonions. Miss W. further writes :\u2014\u2022\ni Mm. Pi'iier suffered somewhat after the trance was over.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 5\n\" Dr. Phinuit seemed to taste the onion. The tongue moved about in the\nmouth and smacked on the lips for several seconds, while I waited with much\ncuriosity. Neither then nor afterwards did I get any hint of the odour\nthrough my own nostrils.\"\nHe localised pinches correctly in various parts of the Ixxly, and\nsensations of touch, temperature, pressure, and the muscular sense seem\nto be all present, though apparently somewhat enfeebled. The sense of\nbearing is present, though this seems to vary in fineness to a certain\nextent in different trances. When I made some rough experiments on,\nlocalisation by pinching\u2014sometimes rather severely\u2014Phinuit explained\nthat he \" lost control \" temporarily of that portion of the body.\n\"Makes it like a stick. I have got no feeling in that for a time, but\nwhen you let go I feel it again.\" Later on, unexpectedly, I held a\nlighted match to the left forearm. The arm was drawn away, not\nsuddenly, but slowly, as though a vague discomfort was appreciated.\n\" Oui, I feel it,\" exclaimed Phinuit. \" Did you feel pain ? \" \" No, felt\ncold\u2014cold, I think.\" I have not tried any severe pain tests. (See\nProceedings, Vol. VI., p. 447.) Whenever I examined the eye\nballs in the medium-trance I found them rolled up, and the pupils\nreacted to light. They reacted also, I learn from Professor James, in\nthe ordinary hypnosis which he succeeded in obtaining with Mrs. Piper.\nOn one occasion, having persuaded Phinuit to stand up,1 I held the\neyelids up and urged Phinuit to force the eyeballs into their ordinary\nwaking position. This seemed to involve considerable effort on Phinuit's\npart, and Mrs. Piper's face became much drawn and rather ghastly\nduring the process. The eyeballs, with a vacant stare, remained down\nfor about half a minute, though I did not take the exact time, and then\nsuddenly rolled up again. (At the end of that sitting Mrs. Piper was\nan exceptionally long time recovering from trance. Phinuit had said\n\" Au revoir,\" but after several minutes spoke again in a low voice, and\ncomplained that he had \" got twisted round somehow and could not find\nhis way out.\" After a short interval, however, Mis. Piper began to\ncome to herself in the usual way.)\nHere I fully expected to have added the report of Mrs. Piper's\nphysician, who attended her for several months in 1890, and who was\npresent at a sitting which Mrs. Piper gave on December 4th, 1890 ;\nbut after hesitating for some time he absolutely refused to make any\nreport whatever.\nDr. Wadsworth, who made an examination of Mrs. Piper's eyes in\ni Mrs. Piper stood up without changing the position of her feet, at the same\ntime throwing her head slightly back and her chest forward, and thrusting the\nthumbs jauntily into what would have been the armholes of her waistcoat had she\nworn one.\n\fG Mr. R. Hodgson.\nthe normal state, informs me that she has slight astigmatism, but that\notherwise the eyes are normal in all respects.i\n\u00a7 3. Hypothesis of Fkaud on the Part of Mrs. Piper.\nI need hardly say that in estimating the value of my own as of\nall other sittings, I was compelled to assume, in the first instance,\nthat Mrs. Piper was fraudulent and obtained her information previously\nby ordinary means, such as inquiries by confederates, &c. Not only\nwas this assumption as to Mrs. Piper's fraud necessary, but it was also\nneedful to suppose that she worked herself into a hypenvsthetic state\nduring which she obtained much further information given in various\nways by the sitter, consciously or unconsciously, by speech, gesture, and\nother muscular action. That I did not obtain a sitting at my first visit\nmight be pointed to as a very suspicious circumstance, and it might well\nbe supposed that, in consequence of my known connection with the\nSociety for Psychical Research, Mrs. Piper might have previously \"got\nup \" information about myself and other active workers in the Society\nin the expectation of future use. The inadequacy, moreover, of my\nnotes may also be alleged, since they were not absolutely verbatim and\nmy attention was more or less given to the associations connected with\nthe information communicated by Phinuit. In reply to this I can only\nsay that I have striven with the utmost care to avoid attributing to\nPhinuit any statement which might have been obtained previously from\nmy own words.2 My opinion about my own sittings is that they would\nappear much more remarkable if stenographic reports had been token.\nNow, we cannot argue that the facts related to me by Phinuit were\nnot such as were likely to have been provided by confederates, because\nwe must suppose that Mrs. Piper has an astuteness at least equal to\nours, and would therefore anticipate an argument of this kind. And\nthere is hardly any single fact about any single person of which a medium\nmay not be legitimately supposed to have acquired some knowledge,\neither accidentally or by systematic secret inquiry. The difficulty in\nsupposing that Phinuit's knowledge has been acquired in this way is\ni Examination hit O. F. WadiKorth, M.D., Boston, Mass.\u2014Hm. L. E.

Fundus normal.\n2 In recording the early sittings both of myself and other persons, my object was\nnot so much to note down every word of Phinuit, but to note the substance of such\nspecific statements as were made by Phinuit without help from the sitter, using, of\ncourse, Phinuit's words as far as possible. I did not, moreover, anticipate any detailed\npublicaiton of these early records, which I made for my own satisfaction and for\nsubsequent questioning of the sitters, at a time when I was looking forward to a\nsystematic examination of Mrs. Piper's trance state by the then existing American\nS.P.R.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 7\nowing to the large number of facts communicated concerning a largo\nnumber of different sitters, special care having been taken with the view\nof preventing Mrs. Piper's knowing anything of these persons before\nhand. There is, I think, in the reports which follow, enough evidence\nto show that fraud on the part of Mrs. Piper is very far from being an\nadequate explanation, though it is, of course, conceivable that in\nsome cases Mrs. Piper, had she been fraudulent, might have acquired In\nordinary means such information as Phinuit gave to the sitter. Mr.\nJohn F. Brown, for example, appears to have concluded that this\nsupposition, allowing also for guesswork and questioning during the\nsitting, is the actual explanation of his own experiences with Mrs.\nPiper (Rejwrts of Sittinys, No. 13) ; and Professor Henry P. Bowditch,\nM.D., has given me an account of some circumstances which he finds\nhard to explain, except upon the hypothesis that Mrs. Piper was\nacting fraudulently.\nProfessor Bowditch had a sitting with Mrs. Piper in May,\n1886, at which the communications were entirely irrelevant. His con\nnection with the American Society for Psychical Research was\nprominent, and he might have been seen by Mrs. Piper presiding at\npublic meetings, and his name ascertained. He is frequently called Dr.\nHenry Bowditch. An uncle of his, Henry I. Bowditch, M.D., was also\nwell known as a practising physician in Boston. About December,\n1887, Professor Bowditch, accompanied by his brother's wife, called on\nMrs. Piper for the purpose of having a sitting. Mrs. Piper, he says,\ndeclined to give a sitting on the plea of ill-health, but held some con\nversation with them, and presumably recognised Professor Bowditch.\nSeveral weeks later I arranged a sitting for them, at the request of Pro\nfessor Bowditch, without, of course, mentioning any names. At this\nsitting, which was held on January 17th, 1888, several specific details\nwere given which purported to come from a deceased lady well known\nto the sitters. Her Christian name and surname were correctly given,\nand also the place of her death, in Europe ; but the references to Pro\nfessor Bowditch, his father, and other relatives were incorrect as applied\nto him, but would have been correct if applied to his uncle, Dr. Hemy\nI. Bowditch, to whom also the deceased lady had been well known.\nMoreover, no statements at all were made which appeared specially to\nconcern Professor Bowditch's sister-in-law, who accompanied him. It\nwas plain to him during the sitting that there was some confusion, but\nit was not till afterwards, in talking the matter over with his sister-in-\nlaw, that it occurred to him that the references would have fitted his\nuncle. Professor Bowditch's inference was that Mrs. Piper had\nobtained information beforehand by ordinary means concerning Dr.\nHenry I. Bowditch, and had applied it to himself, supposing him to be\nthe person.\n\f8 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nUnfortunately no record was made of this sitting, and although\nProfessor Bowditch's explanation is the one that would appear most\nreasonable to any person who was not familiar with Mrs. Piper's\ntrance state, I think it probable that the incident could easily be\nexplained otherwise if we had a detailed report of the conversation\nbetween Professor Bowditch and Phinuit. In personal appearance,\nut least, Professor Bowditch could never be mistaken for his uncle ;\nbut if we suppose Phinuit to be receiving there and then\u2014from\nwhatever source, \"departed spirits\" or the minds of the sitters\u2014a\ngeneral mass of information about the Bowditch family, it would not be\nmatter of surprise that he should be confused as to the two doctors\nHenry Bowditch. It would be much more matter of surprise that Mrs.\nPiper should make this mistake. It may even be that Phinuit was\ndrawing information, not only\u2014at the time of the sitting\u2014 from the\nsitters or from some extraneous source, but also from the knowledge,\nconscious and unconscious, previously possessed by Mrs. Piper, and in\nattempting to piece these fragments of information together made some\nmistakes. But in the absence of precise details as to what Phinuit said,\nhow far there was mere confusion and how far there was definite mis\ntaken identity, my explanation cannot go beyond conjecture. The reader\nmay compare the incidents described by Professor Lodge in Proceedings,\nVol. VI., p. 454 and p. 462 (footnote).\nI have already stated my conviction of Mis. Piper's honesty, and I\nhold further that the reports quoted here\u2014not to speak of those already\npublished in Vol. VI.\u2014establish the existence of some faculty in\nPhinuit which goes at least as far as telepathy. The detailed\nreports themselves are offered as justification for this view, and\n\u2014after what has been already published\u2014I think it superfluous to\nattempt any summary of them for the purpose of proving cither that\nMrs. Piper could not have acquired by normal means the information\ngiven at the sittings, or that Phinuit, as distinguished from Mrs. Piper,\ncould not have obtained all this information by guessing, questioning,\nand interpretation of muscular and other indications consciously and\nunconsciously given by the sitters. My readers, I shall assume, are\nfamiliar with the analysis of Phinuit's character and methods by\nProfessor Lodge and also with the \u2014to a certain extent complementary\n--analysis by Mr. Leaf. With all their criticisms of Phinuit's \"tricks\nand manners \" I substantially if not completely agree, and I wish to\nemphasise this fact very strongly, not because of the mere agreement\nitself, but because it should be understood that I do not pass lightly\nover the weakness and deficiencies of the Phinuit personality. Indeed,\nI have been at sittings where Phinuit has displayed such paltering and\nequivocation, and such a lack of lucidity, that I believe had these been\nmy only experiences with him I should without any hesitation have\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 9\ncondemned Mrs. Piper as an impostor. Such failures appear to depend\nsometimes, but not always, on the sitter. As Phinuit himself confessed\n(May 26th, 1888): \"Sometimes when I come here, do you know,\nactually it is hard work for me to get control of the medium. Some\ntimes I think I am almost like the medium, and sometimes not at all.\nThen [when the control is incomplete] I am weak and confused.\"\nAdmitting, then, and emphasising the shortcomings of Phinuit, and\nallowing that many statements correctly made by Phinuit might be\naccounted for on the supposition that Mrs. Piper had \"got up\" the\ninformation beforehand, I shall here assume that there is nevertheless a\nlarge residuum to be attributed to some supernormal faculty. From\nthis point of view the really important questions for consideration are :\n(1) What is Phinuit? and (2) By what supernormal means does he get\nhis information 1 I have no final answer for either of these questions,\nbut I think it useful to collate briefly some of the most important\nincidents in the records here published, with the view of showing why\nthe most obvious answers are not entirely satisfactory. In doing this\nI propose to follow the example of Professor Lodge (Proceedings, Vol.\nVI., p. 647), and dismiss altogether the hypothesis of imposture on the\npart of Mrs. Piper.\n\u00a7 4. Hypothesis of Thought-Transference from the Sitters.\nConsidering, then, my own first six sittings, I find that all the cor\nrect (verifiable) statements made by Phinuit concerned matters known\nto me, except the insignificant prophecy that my sister (in Australia)\nwould soon have a fourth child\u2014a boy. I had no (conscious) knowledge\neven that another child was \" coming very soon.\" On the other hand,\nI did not consciously know the Christian name of my mother's father,\nthough I had probably heard it, and this was incowectly given as John.\nFurther, Phinuit failed to obtain information, or made fundamental\nmistakes, in matters about which my own recollections were very clear\nand vivid. The most striking circumstances correctly mentioned were\nconcerning the lady whom I have called \" Q.\" and my cousin Fred, and\nwere such as I should expect those persons to select, if in actual com\nmunication with me, as proofs of identity. But then, again, Phinuit was\nunable to tell me of circumstances about which I made special inquiry, and\nwhich were at least as familiar to the alleged \"spirit\" as those described\nto me. Thus, Phinuit never told me the full name of \" Q.,\" though I\nfrequently asked for it at later sittings. His explanation was that \" Q.\"\nrefused to tell him, but Phinuit has frequently urged his ignorance on\nthis point as a proof that he cannot \" read my mind \" (an inability of\nwhich he is very anxious to assure me), and I suspect that this ignorance\nmay be assumed. However this may be, there is no doubt but that\n\f10 Mr. R. Hodysov.\nPhinuit's unquestionable failure to obtain satisfactory replies to many\nquestions which have been asked of the \" deceased friends \" is a most\nformidable objection, as we shall see later, to the \"spirit hypothesis\"\u2014\nat least, as it is commonly accepted.\nAdmitting now that the facts mentioned at these first sittings\nof mine were drawn by Phinuit from my mind, I must notice\nthat they were, certainly most of them, and possibly all of them,\nobtained from my mind at a time when I was not consciously think\ning of them, that is, presuming that Phinuit obtained his knowledge\nduring the sittings. Vivid conscious thinking of a circumstance\ndoes not seem, indeed, to help Phinuit in any way, but rather\nthe contrary. Mr. Wendell's experience (Report, No. 21), which\napparently suggested to him that Phinuit's obtaining the names of his\nuncle and E. was in consequence of their \" coming into his head \" after\nhe had been reminded of their \" death conditions \" by the actions of\nPhinuit\u2014clutching of throat, gasping\u2014does not, I think, necessarily\ninvolve any conscious as distinguished from subconscious thought-trans\nference, especially if we consider that Mr. Wendell's attention may\nhave been temporarily diverted by Phinuit from the thought of the\nname or the personal appearance. (See my remarks about Phinuit's habit\nof turning the conversation away from a subject upon which informa\ntion is sought, p. 14.)\nQ My conclusion, then, about my own first six sittings is that the\nstatements made by Phinuit may be regarded as explicable on the\nhypothesis that he had access to portions of my \" subconscious \" mind?,\nThe same, allowing for Phinuit's previous knowledge, can also be said of\nthe sittings of Mrs. Okie and Dr. Hopkins, and Mr. T. P. Derham, my\nbrother-in-law (Reports, Nos. 7, 8, and 9). I understand that all the\n(verified) facts mentioned to Mr. Derham were known to him, though\nsome of them were unknown to myself.\n(The next reports, in connection with Mrs. Blodgett (Report, No. 10),\nare specially important, owing to Mrs. Blodgett's attempts to obtain\nfrom Phinuit a copy of a letter written by her sister, Miss Hannah\nWild, shortly before death, the contents of this letter being at the time\nof the first experiment unknown to any living person. Mrs. Blodgett\n(of Holyoke, Mass., about 100 miles from Boston), previously unknown\nto Professor James, wrote to Jjjjjifexplaining the circumstances of the\nletter written by her sisterJMKrs. Blodgett thinks that she sent\nProfessor James a copy of the Woman's Journal containing a notice of\nher sister's death, though Professor James has no recollection of this, or\nof knowing even the name of Hannah Wild until the conclusion of the\nfirst experiment. Professor James suggested trying Mrs. Piper. ' The\ncase may be most conveniently considered in four stages.\n(A) The first trial was made early in 1887. Articles worn by Miss\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. II\nWild were forwarded by Mrs. Blodgett to Professor James and liy hint\nto Mrs. Piper's father-in-law, Mr. J. M. Piper, at whose house Mrs. Piper\nwas living at the time. Professor James had explained the nature of the\ntest to Mr. Piper without giving any names, and Phinuit had requested\nsome articles worn by the writer of the letter, to enable him, as he\nalleged, to get into communication with the \" spirit.\" As a result\nPhinuit obtained the name of Hannah Wild, and perhaps some per\nception of her connection with the Woman's Journal, in which she was\ninterested and to whose pages she had contributed, also the name of her\nsister, Bessie (Mrs. Blodgett), to whom she was to give the test, and\nsome impression concerning the then recent marriage of this sister.\nBeyond these facts practically nothing correct was obtained. Mr. Piper\nhad numerous sittings for the purpose of receiving the details of what\nPhinuit gave as the death-bed letter, and was confident that he had\nbeen conversing with the spirit of Hannah WTikl ; yet the description\ngiven of her personal appearance was almost entirely wrong, Phinuit's\nletter contained no hint of the substance of the real letter, which Mis.\nBlodgett forwarded to Professor James1 for comparison with Phinuit's\nstatements, and the 2iumerous circumstances referred to in Phinuit's\nletter had scarcely any relation to the life of Hannah Wild. They\nwere chiefly a tissue of incorrect statements. This result so far\nsuggested that however Phinuit succeeded in obtaining the names and\nthe other impressions which proved to be more or less correct, he at\nleast did not get them from the \"spirit\" of Hannah Wild.\n(\/\u00bb) The next attempt made was about a year later\u2014May 30th, 1888\n\u2014by Mrs. Blodgett herself, who took with her to the sitting, in a small\nbag, various articles which had belonged to her deceased sister. This\nsitting, at which I was present, was very striking, and contained much\nof the personal element which has led so many to suppose that in their\nsittings with Mrs. Piper they have been communicating with their\ndeceased friends. In this case Phinuit \"controlled\" throughout, and\nprofessed most of the time to be repeating the remarks of Hannah Wild,\nwho was represented as exceedingly anxious to prove her identity to\nMrs. Blodgett, frequently affirming that she was Hannah Wild, and\nwould give her sister \" that letter.\" Mrs. Blodgett had carried the\nsmall bag into the sitting-room unperceived by me, and had placed it\non the floor behind her. Phinuit groped^ir this near the beginning of\nthe sitting. All the articles in the ba|^^pectacles, hair, photograph,\nand will\u2014which had belonged to Miss Wild were seized, and various\ndetails concerning them correctly given by Phinuit, excepting the\ndeath-bed letter which had been in the bag, wrapped in a rubber cloth,\ni Professor Jamot U the only living person who knows the contents of the letter.\nHe read it at the end of the first ex|xriment, and immediately returned it to Mrs.\nBlodgett, in whose potseasion it has since remained.\n\f12 Mr. R. Hodgson.\n.and which Mrs. Blodgett tiiok out of the bag and placed on the floor\nbehind her when the bag was opened at the sitting. This letter was\nwrongly stated to be \"at home in the lxix.\" The bag itself was incor\nrectly described as Miss Wild's, but it seems noteworthy that Miss Wild\nhad frequently used it. Mrs. Blodgett was not consciously aware that\nher sister's photograph was in the bag, yet Phinuit correctly assertedi that\nit was before finding it. Similarly Mrs. Blodgett was not consciously\naware that she had put her sister's thimble into the bag, but \"Hannah\"\nstated that she saw Mrs. Blodgett put it into the bag, and Mrs. Blodgett\n.afterwards found that she had done so, but had taken it with other\n.articles out of the bag before starting for the sitting. ) Mrs. Blodgett\nwas doubtless subconsciously aware of both of these facts (compare the\n-experiments of Miss X. in Crystal Vision, Proceedings, Vol. V.) ; and\nProfessor Lodge has noted the keen \" scent \" which Phinuit often\ndisplays for articles which have been connected with some object which\nhe is examining. (See Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 460.) ^ The names and\nother circumstances mentioned at the sitting showed an intimate\nknowledge in some respects of personal matters connected with\nHannah Wild and her relatives, and the remark made by Hannah Wild\nto Mrs. Blodgett when the test letter was put away in the tin lxix was\nquoted, \" It would be like ringing church bells if I could come back \"\n(instead of \" the City Hall bell \"). With all this personal matter\ncorrectly given and purporting to come from Hannah Wild, Mrs.\nBlodgett herself was acquainted. ^On the other hand, references were\nmade to a comb and to a Moses which had no significance for Mrs.\nBlodgett, and the attempt by Phinuit to read the contents of a\nletter written by Alice Wild to Hannah was a failure. Also,\ntwo especially important statements were made about Elizabeth\nWild and Sarah Hcdson (the full name of the latter being cor\nrectly given by Phinuit), one of which at least was incorrect. Both\nwere friends of Hannah Wild ; the former living in Philadelphia,\nthe other in Waterbury, Conn. Neither of these ladies was in good\nhealth when Mrs. Blodgett last heard of them about two years before\nthe sitting. In reply to Mrs. Blodgett's question whether \" Cousin\nElizabeth \" was living, Phinuit stated that she had \"passed out of the\nbody.\" Sarah Hodson, according to my notes at the sitting, was affirmed\nto be living, but according to Mrs. Blodgett's recollections, Phinuit\nstated that she was dead. It was afterwards ascertained that both\nladies were living at the time of the sitting and in much better health\nthan at the time of Miss Wild's death.\ni When Phinuit made this statement he could hardly have detected the presence\nof a photograph by normal means, since, as I remember the incident, the photograph\nwas of small size\u2014vignette, not cabinet\u2014and the envelope in which it was had been\nplaced with other objects in a small parcel not yet opened. The statement may,\nhowever, have been a likely guess.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 13\n(C)(A.t the sitting on May 30th, 1888, I believe that some promise\nwas made by Phinuit that the letter would be dictated to me at a\nlater sitting. Mrs. Blodgett sent me a lock of her sister's hair, which\nshe had cut from her sister's head after death, and with the help of this,\non August 1st, 1888, Phinuit gave what purported to be the substance\nof the letter. This was a statement (in general terms, no names being\ngiven) concerning a disappointment which prevented Miss Wild from\nmarrying. Mrs. Blodgett refers to it as \" the one sorrow of sister's\nlife.\" At a later sitting\u2014October 3rd, in the same year\u2014with the help\nof a much larger lock of hair and a \" tidy,\" which Miss Wild had\nfinished a few days before her death, Phinuit made another attempt,\nworse than before, to give the letter.^ The statements purporting to\ncome from Hannah Wild, some of them as the substance of her death\nbed letter and others in reply to questions which Mrs. Blodgett had\nrequested me to ask, were almost entirely wrong, though there may have\nbeen one or two obscure perceptions by Phinuit of circumstances con\nnected with Miss Wild or Mrs. Blodgett that had not been mentioned\nin previous sittings. Mrs. Blodgett's first husband's name was given as\nJohn Henry (or Henry John) Clifford, whereas it was John Rothmall\nBair, although a Mr. John Henry Clifford is known to her. The name\nof her son was given as \"Willie,\" instead of \" John Marion Barr.\" Miss\nWild knew a \" Mr. Tom \" and his sister, and had talked with him on\nchurch matters, and worked on the tidy in their presence. In Phinuit's\nletter she is described as having talked on church matters with a\nMr. Toivn and his sister. There was possibly also a reference to the\nexistence of a test between Miss Wild and her sister Alice. But\nthe death-bed letter, as we learn from Professor James, was not\nconcerned with any of these matters. It will hardly be contended\nthat there is any proof here of the actual presence of Miss Wild.\n(D) ^The last efforts made to obtain the letter, at two sittings\non May 28th and 29th, 1889, when Mrs. Blodgett herself was again\npresent, were equally unsuccessful. On May 28th Mrs. Blodgett\ntested Phinuit with eleven articles, five of which had been used by\nher sister. The \" influence \" of Miss Wild was recognisedi in connec\ntion with the five articles which had been used by her, though incorrect\nstatements were also made concerning them, and Phinuit (rightly) did not\nconnect her with any of the other six articles. ^ A \" waist \" was rightly\ni The articles were (1) waist, (2) letter, (3) lock of hair, (4) birds' eyes, (5) pin,\n(6) glove, (7) stocking, (8) box, (9) ear-spoon, (10) probe, (11) chain. Of these articles.\n(1), (8), (9), (10), and (11) had been used by Miss Wild. My notes of the sitting are\nspecific as to the recognition of (1), (8), (!)), and (11) as Miss Wild's, and my impres\nsion is that (10) was also recognised as hers, though my notes do not specifically state\nthis. Phinuit failed in (2), (a), and (4), was partially right in (5), getting the-\n\" mother's influence \" with it, but said nothing at all about (0) and (7).\n\f14. Mr. M. Hodgson,\nsaid to have belonged to MissWild, but wrongly alleged to have been worn\nby her during her sickness. And a piece of chain was rightly said to\nhave belonged first to Miss Wild's mother and later to Miss Wild, but\nwrongly alleged to have been given to Miss Wild by her mother. These\ntwo mistakes were likely mistakes for anyone who was somehow aware\nof the connection of the articles in question with particular persons,\nbut did not otherwise know the related facts ; and Mrs. Blodgett in her\nnotes has drawn special attention to other points in the sitting that\ntell strongly against the presence of the \" spirit \" of Hannah Wild.\nThus the \"birds' eyes\" were not recognised \"by Hannah'' at all.\nThe real Hannah Wild, however\u2014although she had never touched\nthem\u2014yet knew all about them, and had been in the habit of seeing\nthem for many years. One incident that occurred at the sitting affords\na striking example of what appears to be a frequent resource of\nPhinuit. (mrs. Blodgett asked who was present when her sister\nwrote the letter. Phinuit began to reply, showed some confusion, and\nthen abruptly changed the subject, thus diverting Mrs. Blodgett's\nthoughts from her question and the answer. Shortly afterwards\nPhinuit recurred to the matter, and gave a correct description of the\ncircumstances. \"She wrote the letter on a stand ; you and sister Alice\nwere there. She sat in a chair with big arms to it ; leant back, tired.^j\nIt will be remembered that in some of our experiments in thought-\ntransference the result suggested that the percipient might have been\ngetting impressions not of the object upon which the agent's attention\nwas concentrated at the moment, but of the object previously thought\nof. In a series of six experiments with diagrams which I made some\nyears ago, with myself as percipient, the agent, a lady, discarded the\nfirst diagram made by her in two of the experiments, in one case on\nthe ground that it was too simple, in the other case on the ground that\nit was too complicated. She had drawn the figure, then crumpled the\npaper and thrown it on one side, and drawn another. In each of these\ntwo cases I got a correct impression of the rejected figure (not of the\nadopted figure in any of the trials), aud it may even be that when the\nobject thought of \"at the time\" is correctly guessed by the percipient,\nthe impression is in reality obtained by him not while the object is\nperceived by the agent, but during one of those transient mental\ndepartures from the object which no agent can altogether prevent, and\nwhich in truth, in the alternate moments, rentier his own perception of\nit more vivid and, strictly speaking, are necessary for any consciousness\nof it at all. Now I have observed that Phinuit, when questioned about\npoints known to the sitter, is accustomed to change the subject of\nconversation somewhat abruptly, apparently for the purpose of\nabsorbing the sitter's waking consciousness by another topic. In the\nmeantime perhaps he is\u2014for so his behaviour suggests\u2014grasping at\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 15\nand surreptitiously examining the experience which he has induced the\nsitter to lay on one side.\nThere is in this sitting also a good illustration of a clumsy attempt\nby Phinuit to minimise the serious mistake which he made in saying\nthat Elizabeth Wild was dead. Mrs. Blodgett had learned that this\nlady was still living, and Phinuit's inquiry about her implies that he,\ntoo, had acquired this knowledge\u2014may we not assume from Mrs.\nBlodgett at this later sitting ?\u2014and was about to evade if possible the\ncharge to be brought against him. Making a vague remark about being\n\" confused \" when he made this wrong statement, he changed the\nsubject, but later referred once more to the \" Aunt Elizabeth \" and\nmade some statements about her ill-health, \u00abtc, since ascertained to be\nentirely untrue. These statements were made apparently for the\npurpose of suggesting to us that Phinuit had confused mere illness\nwith a death.\nOn May 29th one intimate question asked by Mrs. Blodgett, viz.,\nwhat had happened to Hannah that Alice only knew, was answered\ncorrectly\u2014that something \" about mother \" had \" happened twice,\nand if it happened the third time Hannah would pass out.\" This\nwas as much as Mrs. Blodgett knew, and no more was given by\nPhinuit, though Hannah knew more about it, and Mrs. Blodgett's\nliving sister knows more.\nThe evidence, then, in this series of sittings seems to be very far\nfrom proving the presence of Hannah Wild. Most of the statements\nmade by Phinuit are explicable on the hypothesis of thought-transfer\nence from Mrs. Blodgett's mind ; even the correct statements made to\nmyself, months after Mrs. Blodgett had left Boston, Phinuit might\nbe presumed to have obtained from her during her sitting and stored up\nfor later use. Still, there are a few circumstances for which this hypo\nthesis seems insufficient, and among these it ought to be said that there\nare some facts which primd facie seem to support Phinuit's belief that\nhe is aided in obtaining knowledge by handling articles which have\nbeen used by persons who possess the knowledge. Thus the fact that\nPhinuit got the name of Hannah Wild and other connected facts before\nMrs. Blodgett had seen Mrs. Piper at all would be explained if we could\nsuppose that, by means of the articles sent originally through Professor\nJames, he got into some relation with Mrs. Blodgett's mind or the mind\nof Professor James. It may be noted, too, that the name of John Henry\n<or Henry John) Clifford was given (incorrectly given as name of Mrs.\nBlixlgett's first husband), while Phinuit was handling a \" tidy \" which\nhad been (probably) worked upon by Hannah in the house of Mr. John\nHenry Clifford, and, further, that Phinuit seemed to obtain a glimpse\nof specific incidents in connection with Mr. Tom and his sister, in\nwho^e presence Hannah had worked on the tidy. How far the hypo\n\f16 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nthesis that these facts suggest can be seriously entertained, I shall\nafterwards consider. At present I am chiefly concerned to note the\ndifficulties in the way of supposing that all Phinuit's statements in\nconnection with Mrs. Blodgett's experiments can be accounted for by\nthought-transference from the mind of the sitter.\nThe next incident in the reports which suggests that the hypothesis\nof thought-transference from the sitter is inadequate is the subject of\nNo. 15, the announcement to Mre. William James and Mr. Robertson\nJames that their aunt Mrs. Walsh, in New York, had died that morn\ning, and that Mrs. James would find a \"letter or telegram\" to that\neffect when she got home. But this, as Professor James says (Pro\nceedings, Vol. VI., p. 658), may \" have been occasioned by the sitters'\nconscious apprehension of the event.\"i\nIn Report No. 19, Mr. \" A. Y.\" states that what a certain person\nwas doing at the tune of the sitting was correctly described, but it seems\npossible that this might have been suspected by the sitter. He also\nwrites that another person was named, and stated to be fatally ill, as\nwas true, although the fact was not known to Mr. \" A. Y.\" at the time\nof the sitting. But here another hypothesis should be mentioned, sug\ngested by circumstances which have come to my knowledge concerning\nthe sittings of the Rev. W. H. Savage and the Rev. M. J. Savage\n(Reports, Nos. 26 and 2\"), and to which I shall refer later (see p. 35).\nCan we be sure that no other friend who knew of the illness had had a\nsitting previously and had provided Phinuit telepathically or otherwise\nwith the information afterwards given to Mr. \" A. Y.\" ? At the\nsame time, there are cases in which this hypothesis is highly improbable,\nsuch as the case mentioned by Miss Z. (Report, No. 28), who had but\none sitting with Mrs. Piper, for which she made engagement herself\nabout a week in advance and without giving her name. \" In the\nmidst of other tests \" Phinuit suddenly said that he \" saw a lady by\nthe name of Marie or Maria, and in the room with her was, she should\nsay, her daughter, perhaps, named Estelle or Stella. The lady Maria\nhad some trouble on the back of her hands and wrists which looked like\neczema.\" This was practically true, as Miss Z., who was ignorant of\nthe fact, ascertained by writing to her \" Aunt Maria living in Vermont,\nsome one hundred and fifty miles from Boston, who has a daughter\ni Misapprehensions are so easy that I think it well here to remind the reader that\nfor my present purjiOHe I have dismissed from consideration the hypothesis of imposture\nun the part of Mrs. Piper. Referring to the above-mentioned incident from the\nbarely evidential point of view I wrote in an article in the Forum for April, 1890, that\n\"it might be alleged that the medium, in Boston, had a confederate in New York,\nwhere the death occurred, who was watching for the death of the aunt, and who\ntelegraphed to the medium the information that was given to the sitters. This is far\nfrom being my own opinion, but I feel bound to mention the possibility of such an\narrangement.\"\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 17\nStella.\" This incident could hardly have been learnt from the mind of\nthe sitter, as she was unlikely to have heard of the trouble with her\naunt's hands and completely forgotten about it.\nThe incident narrated in Report No. 29 might have been among\nthg most remarkable of the series had contemporary records been\nobtainable. It appears from the account that Mrs. W. was told by\nPhinuit that her son Nelson\u2014who had been away from home about\nseventeen years, from whom she had not heard for three years, and of\nwhose whereabouts she was ignorant\u2014was coming home, that she\nwould hear from Nelson within two weeks by a letter from a friend of\nNelson's, and that she would afterwards get a letter from Nelson\nhimself. These letters came within the stated time, and a later one\n(all three from California) announcing his departure for home. The\na-jcount is given by Mrs. D. (sister of Mrs. W.), who states that Mrs.\nW. informed her of these details of the sitting immediately on her\nreturn from Mrs. Piper. It is corroborated by Miss Webster (now Mrs.\nBrowne, see Report No. 39)\u2014known to me\u2014who states that she heard\nof the incident from Mrs. D. before Mrs. W,'s son had returned. The\ncase is a very interesting one, but as the account was written nearly\ntwo years after the event, and we cannot question the sitter, Mrs. W.\nherself, who died two months after her son's return, we can hardly use\nit as a basis for any new theory as to Phinuit's capacity. It may be\nwell to point out, however, that the experience, as it stands, seems\nexplicable on the hypothesis that Phinuit got somehow into relation\nwith the mind of Mrs. W.'s son Nelson.\nMr. A, J. C. (Report No. 32) was informed that his niece had \" a\nhutneur, a breaking out.\" He was unaware of it, and the statement\nwas correct, but he was also incorrectly told that his sister had trouble\nwith a tooth.\nAnother case which loses much of its value from not having been\nrecorded in writing until a year afterwards is the report (Report No. 34)\ngiven by Mr. and Mrs. \" M. N.,\" both personally known to me, but\nnot, so far as I am aware, residing in America. According to the\naccount, the death of Mr. M. N.'s father was foretold as about to\nhappen in a few weeks. It occurred suddenly a few weeks afterwards,\nin England, from heart-failure. Mr. M. N. probably knew that his\nfather had been suffering from an attack of bronchitis. Two or three\ndays after the death Phinuit described some of the details of his-\nfather's will, and claimed to have influenced his father, while yet alive,\non these matters ; but the most extraordinary part of the account is\nthe statement that Mr. M. N.'s sister in England, who was chiefly at\nher father's bedside the last three days of his life, said that her father\n\" had repeatedly complained of the presence of an old man at the foot\nof his bed, who annoyed him by discussing his private affairs.\" Miss\nc\n\f18 Mr. R. Hodgson.\n\" M. N.'s \" testimony, however, at present is only second-hand ; and I\ndo not recall any other testimony to the apparition of Phinuit (?) except\nan incident related by Mrs. Holmes (who assisted me in several experi\nments with Mrs. Piper, see Reports Nos. 45-50), where there is nothing\nto show that what was seen was any more than a purely subjective hallu\ncination. The receipt of a special letter which Phinuit correctly prophe\nsied for Mr. \" M. N.\" might possibly have been anticipated in the sitter's\nunconscious mind ; but the statement that a relative had a sore or\nwounded thumb\u2014afterwards verified\u2014was probably entirely beyond\nthe knowledge of the sitters.\nMr. Rich (Report No. 40) was informed of mistakes made by his\ncoloured cook in the preparation of medicine, and afterwards verified the\nstatements made by Phinuit, though he was ignorant of the circum\nstances at the time of the sitting. He was also informed that he had\na sister who was born dead (premature birth) some years before his own\nbirth, and, so far as he knew, he first heard of the fact from Phinuit.\nHe was directed by Phinuit for verification to his \" aunts,\" from one\nof whom he did, in fact, obtain confirmation of the statement.\nBut the strongest evidence that Phinuit is not confined for his in\nformation to the knowledge of the sitter is drawn from the records of\nexperiments with locks of hair and other objects. Ceeteris ]xiribus,\ninformation volunteered, so to speak, by Phinuit, can never be so valu\nable evidentially as information obtained in response to determinate\nexperiment. Thus, for example, the chances that Phinuit may have\nascertained from previous sitters, telepathically or otherwise, the infor\nmation desired, are vastly reduced when the choice of subject lies with\nthe sitters and not with Phinuit. Three notable instances of experi\nment on this line are described by Professor Lodge (Proceedings,\nVol. VI., pp. 458-463), and there are not a few cases in the reports here\nquoted. Let us take a brief survey of these.\nDiscovering somewhat early in my investigation that Phinuit\nclaimed to obtain special information from locks of hair, which he re\ncommended should be enclosed in silk or tinfoil, I procured some locks\nof hair from friends in England, arranging that I should be ignorant of\ntheir associations. Those which I tried under these conditions were\ncomplete failures (Report No. 41, 1-5). In another case a lady, Mrs. M.,\nknown to me, sent from England, at my request, a lock of her own hair.\nThis evoked from Phinuit a general description of character, true as far\nas it went, and some other details about which I was ignorant, and\nwhich were chiefly wrong (Report No. 41, 6). These trials, of course,\nsuggest that when Phinuit does recognise a lock of hair, it is by direct\ntelepathy, but I venture to think that we must hesitate before adopting\nthis explanation, as Phinuit's success in \" recognising \" locks of hair in\nmany other cases is certainly remarkable. A lock of hair from Hannah\n\fObservations oj Certain Phenomena of Trance. 19\nWild, deceased, was at once recognised (Report No. 10). In another\ncase (Report No. 12) two locks of hair, known to the sitter, were\ngiven successively to Phinuit. These had been close together for a\nshort time, and Phinuit complained of their Vieing \" mixed.\" His\nremarks about each lock of hair would have been almost entirely\ncorrect, so far as they went, if applied to the other. Miss Savage (Re\nport No. 25) took three locks of hair to her sitting. One of them was her\nmother's hair ; this was correctly stated by Phinuit, and her mother's\nill-health was correctly diagnosed, other details concerning the family\nbeing also given. These facts were known to Miss Savage. The other\ntwo locks of hair were given to her by Mr. Day, and Miss Savage was\nunaware to whom they belonged. One of them was recognised as be\nlonging to Mr. Day, concerning whom additional facts were given ; but\nas Mr. Day had previously had a sitting with Mrs. Piper, we may sup\npose that these statements were possibly reminiscences from this previous\nsitting. As to the third lock of hair, Phinuit could only say that it\nhad not been cut off near the head, and had been handled by too many\npeople ; and, in fact, it had been cut off near the end of the hair, and\nhad passed through several people's hands. Miss Z. (Report No. 28)\ntook two locks of hair, knowing to whom they belonged\u2014her brother\nand the Rev. M. J. Savage. It does not appear that Mr. Savage's own\nname was given by Phinuit, but he was unmistakably signified by the\nnames of other members of his family and his relationship to them.\nIn connection with her brother's hair Miss Z. received her brother's\nname\u2014Charlie\u2014and the details of an incident in her brother's life\nabout his spending a night with Ned M. or N. just before this Ned\ndied of consumption. All that Miss Z. knew consciously was that\na poor boy of whose last name she was not sure, and whose first name\nshe had never heard, had died several years before of consumption\nand that her brother had been kind to him. She learnt afterwards\nfrom her brother that the statements made at the sitting were true.\nNed's surname began with N. Mrs. G. H. Browne (Report No. 39)\ntook two locks of hair, apparently knowing from whom they were ob\ntained. Phinuit demanded both of these before he described either,\non the ground, seemingly, as he has frequently put it at other\ntimes, that the \" influences \" had got \" mixed,\" and he wished to dis\nentangle them. The characters were correctly given from the locks of\nhair and the full name correctly stated in connection with at least one\nof them, viz., \" Bertram Ellis.\" Mr. Rich (Report No. 40) took a lock\nof hair, knowing that it belonged to a friend's sister, but descriptions\nunknown to him were given of persons said to be connected with a fire\n(about which the owner of the lock of hair was specially interested and\nwished him to inquire), and these descriptions \" tallied perfectly with\nthat of the parties suspected.\" Again, a lock of hair belonging to a\nc 2\n\f20 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nfriend was at once recognised as his by Phinuit when Mr. Rich pre\nsented it. Miss E. G. W, (p. 32) mentions the incident of her sending\na lock of hair of a sick friend from a distance to Mrs. Piper, and the\ncomplete failure of the test. The lock of hair sent to me by Mrs. S.,\nfrom Albany, N.Y., suggested to Phinuit a strange mixture of truth\nand error (Report No. 41, 7) ; but the correct statements might have\nbeen chiefly guesses depending upon the fact, known to the sitter\n(myself), that the hair was white.\nOn May 28th, 1891, I gave to Phinuit some hair carefully tied up\nwith silk ribbon, which h td been in my possession about six months,\nand came, as I knew, from a cat which I had seen in Baltimore. It was\ngiven to me while on a visit in Baltimore by a young lady of the family,\nwith whom the cat was a very great pet. None of the family had ever\nseen Mrs. Piper. Of course, I gave no intimation to Phinuit that the\nhair was other than human, though this would be revealed by its\ncolour.\n\" Lady in connection with this that's passed out of the body not long ago.\nI see a big black grey cat, and I see, oh, a funny looking cat, kind of a pet. It\nlays down on a rug a good deal. The lady that gave it you . . . it's a\ngeneral pet, a big fellow.\" (Go and try to get cat's name.) \"This cat was\nill a little while ago,\u2014didn't eat much. Great big nice fellow. Mary con\nnected with it, in body , . . elderly lady, aunt, I think, passed out of body\nsome time ago. Will get more another time.\"\nAt the close of a sitting on June 4th, 1891, 1 asked for the name of\nthe cat, presenting the hair again.\n\" Sounds like Pick.\"\nPhinuit then wrote what might be interpreted as Pisk or Disk, but\nmore probably 7'isk.\n\" I think it's Pete,\u2014P\u2014e\u2014t\u2014e. No, Peek.\"\nOn July 10th, 1891, I tried the hair again, and Phinuit said :\n\"Name sounds like Pick. Girl has headaches a good deal in sur\nroundings of this one. . . . There's four of them, five of them. One\nof them's away. Think it's a cousin ; think they call him Fred. The lady\nMary wears glasses, you know, occasionally.\"\nThe cat is of enormous size, of uniform purplish grey colour (no\nblack). Mary is the first name of the mother of the family to whom\nthe cat belongs. This I had forgotten, but knew \" subconsciously,\" as\nit appeared in her signature to the account of some experiences which\nI had read, her first names being written Mary E. The cat's name, as\nI knew, was Dick, and that Phinuit should finally give Pick for\nDick is curious in connection with the precisely similar approxima\ntion in the case of Professor Richet's dog. (Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\np. 620.)\nImmediately after the sitting on May 28th, I wrote to the lady who\ngave me the cat's hair, who informed me that there had not been any\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 21\ndeath of an \" elderly lady aunt,\" and there had not been \" deaths of\nflny such members of the family for years \" ; also that the statements\nabout the cat (on May 28th) were \" not correct in any one particular\";\nalso that the Mary in her mother's name \" was completely dropped, and\nto her family and friends she has always been Lily and Lizzie \" (her\nname being Mary Elizabeth). To my further inquiries, after the later\nsittings, I have received no reply. I vaguely recalled having seen\nMrs. [X.] wear glasses, but could not recall having heard that either of\nthe daughters had headaches. On these points I have learnt through a\nfriend [November 2nd, 1891] that Mrs. [X.] does wear glasses\n\" occasionally, but not regularly,\" and that the daughter who gave me\nthe hair \" has suffered from terrible headaches until recently.\" I have\nnot yet succeeded in obtaining information concerning the other points\nmentioned.\nBut it is not merely \" locks of hair \" that appear to set Phinuit on\nthe track of events that may or may not be known to the sitters. Any\nobject, if it has been handled or worn much and almost exclusively by\nspecific persons, seems to serve equally well. Indeed, though not\nenough experiments in this direction have as yet been tried to\nwarrant me in making any final statement about this, the conclusion\nis strongly suggested that on this path Phinuit is most reliable, though\nnot by any means infallible. At least I think that he is much more\nlikely to succeed with the help of such objects than without them. It\nis quite conceivable, of course, that Phinuit's belief that such articles\nact as clues may itself influence his success, even though that belief\nbe merely subjective.\nAt my fourth sitting (Report No. 4) Phinuit was able to tell me\nthat I had \"lost something,\" and after handling my keys gave a\nfairly detailed description of the place in the mountains where I had\nlost a bunch of keys, between two or three months previously ; but,\noddly enough, he insisted that the keys were still in the mountains,\nmuch as if a picture of the place had been suggested to him with the\nkeys lying there as a part of the scene ; and this, moreover, after the\nkeys had been returned to me. Somewhat similar was Phinuit's\ndetection that Mr. Derham (Report No. 9) had lost a \" funny round\nthing, a ring thing . . . black fellow got it,\" Mr. Derham\nhaving left his field-glass in the train at Niagara, and suspecting that\nthe conductor, a coloured man, had taken it. But in this case it does\nnot appear whether Phinuit obtained a \" clue \" from some specific\nobject worn by Mr. Derham at the sitting, or, without such help, by\ndirect telepathy. In the experiment made by Mrs. Blodgett (Report\nNo. 10) the name Hannah Wild was correctly given by Phinuit as the\nwearer of a glove and a hat-lining, but, besides this, Phinuit made a\nlarge number of other statements in connection with Hannah Wild,\n\fMr. R. Hodgaon.\nnearly all of which were wrong. At later sittings other articles belonging\nto Hannah Wild were immediately recognised as hers. (See Report\nNo. 10, and see also pp. 11-15). The stone presented by Miss Z.\n(Report No. 28) apparently afforded a clue to the personality and\nsurroundings of the owner, and possibly to the circumstances under\nwhich he first obtained it. The \"piece of embroidery\" tried by Mr.\nRich (Report No. 40) produced the name of the sailor who made it.\nMore important still, Mr. Rich took a box, of the contents of which\nhe knew nothing, and Phinuit described correctly the person X. who\ngave Mr. Rich the box, the person Y. who had provided X. with the\narticle for the experiment, and the person Q. who had given the article\nto Y. The article in the box was described by Phinuit as a \" charm \"\nand \"glittering,\" and as having been brought from \"far off over the\nsea \" ; it was a carved \" but not glittering \" button brought from\nJapan, and \" latterly worn as a charm with a gold attachment.\" Mr.\nRich also tried a dog's collar, with which Phinuit got the description\nof the dog and his names, Rover and Grover, these circumstances being\nknown to Mr. Rich. Miss Edmunds (Report No. 43) was correctly told\nthat her locket brought her grandmother's \" influence,\" and that she\nhad had it since she was a little girl, also that her watch had been\ngiven by her father to her aunt, who had given it to her ; these state\nments being made after Phinuit had handled the objects. A little box\nin which her father used to keep coins was also recognised as having\ncontained \" little shiny things \" and having been connected with her\nfather. At a sitting on June 25th I presented a bookmark which\nMiss Edmunds had placed between cards to prevent injury, and the\nhistory of which was known to her but not to me. Phinuit recognised\nMiss E.'s \"influence\" in the cards, but was completely wrong about\nthe bookmark. At a later sitting Miss E. herself took the bookmark,\nand Phinuit obtained its \" associations \" : that it was connected with a\nlittle girl pupil\u2014described\u2014of Miss E. ; that Miss E. had heard from\nher when she was ill ; that she was dead. The names Emma and\nMaria were given, and a message was offered from Maria to Emma, and\nGideon was said to be a cousin. These statements were correct, Maria\nbeing the girl's name, and Emma the name of her mother. All these\ncircumstances were known to Miss E. Two other statements about\nwhich Miss E. was ignorant were made in connection with the book\nmark, and she has not yet been able to ascertain whether they are true\nor not.\nThe pen which Mrs. C. presented (Report No. 44) was at once\nrecognised as bringing the \" influence \" of her deceased husband, and\nPhinuit was conscious of another article on the person of Mrs. C. that\nwas also her husband's, and finally named the watch. \" Your husband\nsays it's his watch, but it's not his chain.\" Mrs. C. had temporarily\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 23\nforgotten that she was wearing her husband's watch, which she had\ncarried for about a month, having broken her own. She had taken her\nhusband's chain off and put her own on.\nNow some of these incidents are explicable on the hypothesis of\ndirect telepathy from the sitter, though even in these the object seems\nto serve in some way as a link of association ; but in others this hypo\nthesis is inadequate, as in the case of the box taken by Mr. Rich. The\nevidence, of course, in the cases which I have thus briefly summarised is\ntoo slender to afford a substantial conclusion, but the experiments\nrecorded in the last series of sittings\u2014those held since Mrs. Piper's\nreturn to America\u2014go far to confirm the view that it is not necessary\nthat the sitter should be aware of the associations of the object, but\nthat contact with the object itself, independently of the sitter, in some\nway enables Phinuit to obtain correct information concerning its\nassociations.\nIn experiments 1 made in connection with Mrs. Holmes (pp. 139, 1 40),\nthe first two locks of her hair presented\u2014the one by myself who knew\nto whom it belonged, and the other by Miss R. who knew nothing\nabout it\u2014both failed as clues ; but a third lock, which\u2014unlike the\nothers\u2014had been cut close to the head, was immediately recognised by\nPhinuit as the \"same influence.\" I presented this on June 5th, 1891,\nat the latter part of the sitting (the first part of which had been\noccupied by the objects sent to me by Mr. \"V.,\" see p. 132), and\nPhinuit at once began to make statements which suggested that he was\ngetting veridical glimpses of some kind owing to the lock of hair.\nAmong other things Phinuit stated that the owner \"had something the\nmatter with her foot \" and that she \" had to have something done to it\nnot long since \"; and it is a curious coincidence that the letter of Mrs.\nHolmes accompanying the hair mentioned an accident to her son's foot,\nand also enclosed a letter from this son describing the accident. I may\nhave read these letters hastily, when I received them, on June 4th, the\nday before the sitting, but could not recall the incident of the \"foot.\"\nI draw attention here to a \" trivial \" circumstance, which in itself\nproves nothing, because I think it, nevertheless, may indicate a possible\ncause of some of Phinuit's mistakes, or apparent mistakes. At one of\nmy early sittings I handed Phinuit an envelope addressed to myself, con\ntaining a letter. Phinuit gave a correct general description of the\nwriter and gave the single name William in connection with it. This,\nthough correct, was, of course, not remarkable, but Phinuit went on\nthen to describe a lady also in connection with it\u2014tall, fair, &c. Later\non in the sitting I gave Phinuit another envelope, and after handling it\nhe at once exclaimed that this was the \" influence \" he had described\npreviously in connection with \" the gentleman \" ; that I had got them\n\f24 J\/r. R. Hodgson.\n\" mixed \" ; that it had nothing to do with him. The description as first\ngiven did suit the writer of the second letter, viz., Mrs. Piper herself.i\nReturning to the experiment of June 5th, some of the correct state\nments made by Phinuit concerned matters known to me, but of most of\nthem I was ignorant, and Phinuit was wrong in describing the hair as\ngrey and black, whereas I knew that it was grey and brown-gold.\nSimilarly, most of the statements at the later sittings referred to matters\nunknown to me, though I had visited Mrs. Holmes, had seen the house\nand surroundings, and met the members of her daughter's family. I had\nalso met Miss Eleanor or Ella B., whose first name was given as Ella by\nPhinuit. The apparent success of Phinuit in locating Mrs. Holmes at\nthe sitting of June 10th led to my requesting her to make notes of her\ndoings on June 15th at the time of my sitting. This, unfortunately,\nshe did not do until after she had received my report of the sitting.\nAccording to her annotations, the following statements made by Phinuit\nwere approximately correct as regards her doings close to and during\nthe hour of the experiment, but Phinuit's description did not coincide\nexactly in time with her actions, but were given about half an hour later.\nPhinuit stated that she trimmed some flowers and put them in a vase ;\nthat she sat down at a desk to write, and that Charles Was on the\npaper in front of her ; that she went to the window to speak to a man,\nthat she pulled something down at the window and returned to the desk ;\nthat she \" pawed over a box of things.\" Phinuit also stated, incor\nrectly, that she had a parcel like a book in her hand that she had been\nreading, had thrown a wrap over her head, had on a dark dress with\nlittle light spots in it, was doing something to a picture, and, later, was\ndoing something with a brush.\nThe correct statements appeared to be so much more than could\nbe due to chance that I requested Mrs. Holmes to write out her doings\nbetween 11.15 and 12.30 on June 23rd and 24th, sign the record and\nobtain the corroborative signature of her daughter, Mrs. K., and mail\nher account at once to Professor H. P. Bowditch, to whom also on\nthe day of the experiment I sent a copy of my notes of Phinuit's\nstatements concerning the doings of Mrs. Holmes. These two sittings\nI regard as failures on the part of Phinuit to see what Mrs. Holmes\nwas doing at the time, but to the student of the detailed accounts\n(Reports Nos. 45 to 49), with the comments of Mrs. Holmes, it will, I\nthink, be strongly suggested that Phinuit in some way was getting\ni I asked Phinuit whether the writer of this second letter was \"in the body \" or\n\"in spirit.\" He replied at once, \"In the body,\" but added: \"Why, no; that's\ncurious. There she is in the spirit, talking to an old lady.\" This appeared to be\nwilder Phinuit, who, after some soliloquising and mumbling, went on to another sub\nject. Several times at the close of later sittings he referred to the \" medium \" as\n\"coming back,\" \"laughing,\" \"asking questions,\" \" trying to touch the sitter,\" &c\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 25\nglimpses into the mind of Mrs. Holmes, was reading off some of her\npast experiences (i.e., past before the moment of Phinuit's statements),\n<ind that some of these occurred as recently as, say, half an hour\npreviously ; though certainly Phinuit was not' clairvoyantly then and\nthere perceiving what Mrs. Holmes was doing.\nA similar conclusion is suggested by the attempts of Phinuit\nto describe my doings on July 1st (Report No. 50), and the doings of\nMrs. Holmes and myself on July 6th (Report No. 51). In this sitting\nof July 6th, 1891, Phinuit located me incorrectly at two different\nplaces, his description of which indicates circumstances of my holi\ndays in the summer of 1890, and although, after handling the envelope\naddressed by me, Phinuit corrected these mistakes and located me in\nmy own rooms, he may have acquired this information through the\nleading question asked intentionally by Miss Edmunds, who knew\nwhere I was. Still, even in this case, and putting on one side the\nknowledge that he may have obtained telepathically or otherwise\nfrom Miss Edmunds concerning my doings, Phinuit seems to have\ngiven more correct information concerning my actual doings than can\nbe accounted for by mere chance ; that is to say, if as much success\nwere obtained in a large number of experiments, we should infer that\nPhinuit was exhibiting some supernormal faculty beyond that of\nthought-transference from the sitter.\nThis general conclusion is greatly strengthened by the results\nof a sitting on October 16th, 1891 (Report No. 53). Miss A.\ntook with her to the sitting three articles, of the history of which\nshe knew nothing\u2014a locket, a ring, and a watch. The locket she\nobtained the evening before through a lady friend whom she met\nby accident in the street. This friend, at Miss A.'s request for\na \" personal article of an individual unknown to her,\" called at the\noffice of a gentleman whom Miss A. had never seen (she \" knew only\nhis surname in a casual way \") and procured from him the locket. It\nwas wrapped in a paper envelope, and Miss A. did not look at it till\nthe sitting was over. Inter alia, the owner of the locket was correctly\ndescribed as being physically well, handsome, of light hair and com\nplexion, as having a big head, and as being immensely extravagant, as\nwriting and dictating (letters, itc.) a great deal. Phinuit stumbled\nround and about the names Joseph and George in his attempts to get\nthe owner's Christian name, mentioning both (and also we must add\nJudson) without affirming either to be the name. Joseph George were\nthe owner's first names. After the locket was opened, which con\ntained a picture of the owner's mother on one side and some hair of\nhis father and mother on the other, Phinuit correctly got the father's\nand mother's \" influence \" from the hair, and apparently connected\nthe name Elizabeth with the hair and the picture, Elizabeth\n\f20 Mr. B. Hodgson.\nbeing the name of the owner's mother. There seemed, indeed, to be\nsome confusion between the \" influences \" of the owner and those of his\nmother ; and in connection with the latter, apparently, various names\nwere given, of which the owner knows nothing. He knows, however,\nvery little of his mother's family, and apparently is not interested\nenough to make the inquiries necessary for corroboration.\nMiss A. knew, but not intimately, the owner of the ring and the\nwatch. Phinuit said that the ring brought a bad influence\u2014that there\nwas an insane lady connected with it who began to lose her mind at\nan early age, and that another person connected with it died with\ncancer. Concerning the watch Phinuit said that it came across the\nwater many years ago, had been in Italy ; that it had the influence of\na gentleman who had died ; that the owner had a sister named Annie.\nThe name Elizabeth, Eliza, Lizzie was given in connection with the\nwatch. Phinuit said that he saw the watch in a box with other\ntrinkets kept in cotton. The names, John, Joseph, and Jennie were\nfinally given. All these details proved to be correct, except the name\nJennie, the owner's mother being named Jesse [Jessie ?].\nThe name of a relative Henry was given as having been connected\nwith some \" printing \" establishment, and also the name Davis. It\nwas further stated that a Henry gave the watch to Elizabeth. I pre\nsume that these details are incorrect, though the report is not quite\nclear upon this point. The present owner was wrongly called a man.\nThe ring and watch, it appears, were kept in the same box. John, a\n\"bad character,\" had given the ring to the present owner, who suspected\nhim of having stolen it. John's father had repudiated a debt to the\nowner's mother ; he died of cancer in the stomach. The owner's sister,\nnamed Elizabeth, and called Eliza and Lizzie, suffered a great fright at\nthe age of three years, from being left alone in a burning house, and\n\" gradually became entirely idiotic.\" She was for many years under\nthe sole charge of the owner of the ring, and as the watch amused her,\nit was frequently given to her by the present owner's mother, to whom\nit came at the death of the uncle Joseph. The watch, Geneva make,\nhad been Ixmght abroad by Joseph, who lived for some time in Italy.\nSeveral additional correct statements which were made in connection\nwith the articles, but not mentioned in the report, were regarded as\ntoo private for publication.\nMiss A.'s own view appears to be a form of that suggested by several\nprevious reports, and particularly in connection with Mrs. Blodgett's.\nexperiments, that the information given by Phinuit was obtained in\nsome way from the objects themselves, to the exclusion, that is, of\nindividual minds either of the living or the dead. Miss A. stated, in\nreply to my inquiry, that Phinuit did not profess to obtain his infor\nmation (concerning the objects) from \" spirits.\" \" He gave no intima\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 27\ntion that he was getting his facts from anyone, ' in ' or ' out of the\nbody ' ; the impression conveyed was rather that he was ferreting about\nfor himself in some obscure way for the information asked.\" It is\nprobable, however, that if Phinuit had been questioned on this point he\nwould have claimed that his information was derived from the deceased.\nThus (March 21st, 1888) : Phinuit : \" Who's Margaret in your family ?\"\nR. H. : \"Can't you tell me that?\" Phinuit: \"It's your mother.\"\n[Correct.] R. H. : \"Who told you that ? \" Phinuit : \" Your father.\"\nAgain, I placed in Phinuit's hands a pencil-case with the initials\nJ. B. upon it, saying that I had received it from a friend who wanted\nto be told who gave it to him. The name of John B was given\ncorrectly, but he has a middle name which was not given at all. (That\nhe had a middle name was known to me at the time, though I cannot\nrecall that I had ever heard what it was, beyond the initial letter.)\nThen :\u2014\n\" George gave it to him. I get the influence of Elinor and Palline, and\na young man. No, it wasn't George, cross that out. It was Harry or\nHenry, and Harry's sister's influence was connected with it before he gave it\nto him. That is all I can tell you.\" \"How did you get to know this?\"\n\" J B 's wife in spirit told me. She's gone away now.\"\nPauline is the name of Mr. B.'s eldest daughter, and Eleanor is the\nname of one of her most intimate friends. But Miss B. and two other\nmembers of Mr. B.'s family (not himself) had previously had a sitting\neach with Mrs. Piper, and the names Eleanor and Pauline had been\ngiven at Miss B.'s sitting, at which her mother, deceased, was also\nreferred to. All that was correct was in my mind, consciously or\nsubconsciously, but what I desire specially to emphasise here is that\nwhile Phinuit's language\u2014about \" getting the influence,\" &c.\u2014did not\nsuggest the \"spirit\" hypothesis, but rather the contrary, he claimed,\non being questioned, that he received his information from a \" spirit.\"\nFurther, he has recently expressly disclaimed any power of obtain\ning information from objects themselves independently of specific\npersonalities.\n\u00a7 5. Clairvoyance and Prophecy.\nAt different times, I have tried a few experiments for \" clairvoy\nance,\" presenting envelopes containing writing unknown to me, and\nturning the hands of a hunting-watch so that I should be ignorant\nof their position. Phinuit disclaimed any ability to tell the contents\nof the letters, but thought he could \" feel,\" through the case of the\nwatch, the positions of the hands. The results, however, on that\noccasion did not justify his belief, and I did not repeat the watch\nexperiments. (See Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 457.)\nSeveral incidents recounted in the reports suggest that Phinuit may\nhave \" prophetic \" power (see especially the cases related by Miss W.,\n\f28 Mr. R. Hodgson.'\np. 34, and Reports Nos. 34 and 36), but there are other cases, besides those\nmentioned in the report, where Phinuit has made specific prophecies\nwhich were unfulfilled, and without a tolerably complete record of both\nthe fulfilled and the unfulfilled predictions, we cannot conclude that his\nsuccesses, allowing for supernormal knowledge of the present, are more\nthan would be due to chance. But I think that while there is no\nevidence at present worth detailed consideration, for the view that\nPhinuit possesses any power of premonition, in the strict sense of the\nterm, there is enough evidence to make it desirable to record his\n\"prophecies\" most carefully in future.\n\u00a7 6. The \"Spirit\" Hypothesis concerning Phinuit and other\n\" Controls.\"\nIt now becomes necessary to take into more direct consideration\nthe assertion which Phinuit persistently makes concerning himself and\nhis communications, that he is the \" spirit \" of a once but no longer\nliving human being, that he occupies Mrs. Piper's organism during her\ntrance, and receives direct messages from the \" spirit \" friends of the\nsitters. This, as is known to the readers of the previously published\nreports, is the invariable form of Mrs. Piper's trance, save that other\n\" controls,\" who also profess to be \" spirits \" of once living human\nbeings, occasionally take the place of Phinuit.\nNow, the status to be assigned to Phinuit will depend, partly on his\nown account of himself\u2014with verification or otherwise\u2014our opinion of\nhis veracity, the conclusions we may reach concerning his \" powers,\" &c,\nand also upon the impressions produced by the other alleged \"controls.\"\nThere appear to be at least three instances of other \" controls \" in the\nfollowing reports (Reports Nos. 16, 30, and 40. Bee also Report No.\n35). But the fullest account which I have received concerning other\n\" controls \" is given by Miss W., a most excellent and discriminating\nwitness. Other members of her family have also had sittings with\nMrs. Piper, and they form such an important contribution to our study\nof Mrs. Piper's trance personality that I quote Miss W.'s account in\nthis part of my article.i Miss W. has had forty-five sittings with Mrs.\ni My attention was first called to the sittings of the W. family by a message given\nby Phinuit in the latter part of January, 1890, while Mrs. Piper was in England, and\nforwarded to me by Mr. Myers. \" Little Katie \\V. is very sorry (in the spirit world)\nthat the little dog Gyp has been run over and had its foot hurt. Her father\n{William W. ) has had a cold, but is better.\" Mr. \\V.'s address was sent to me, having\nbeen obtained from Mrs. Piper. I wrote to Mr. W., informing him that I had\nreceived a message from his daughter through Mrs. Piper, but wished, before deliver\ning it, to ask him some questions. He called upon me on February 11th, m'M. H. :\n\" Have you a little dog Gyp! \" \\V. : \" Yes.\" H. : \" Is he all right ? :' W. : \" So\nfar as I know ; he was all right when I left home this morning.\" H. : \" Gyp has not\nhad any accident within the last few weeks?\" W. : \"No; he had an accident last\nfall some time. He was run over by a milk-cart, and one of his toes was nearly cut\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance.\nPiper between November, 1886, and June, 1889. She has witnessed'\nfour controls\u2014Phinuit, her mother's stepmother, and two friends.\nThese personalities appeared very different from one another. Miss\nW. has made a careful record of her sittings, usually taking notes,\nduring the sitting, and writing out her detailed account the same day.\nHer father has also had many sittings, unfortunately not recorded, at\nmost of which his daughter Katy, who died in 1871, when but three\nmonths old, purported to control directly. Her mother has had one\nsitting, not recorded, and her sister, Miss M. A. W., has had three or\nfour sittings, also not recorded. Miss W. states that the majority of\nher own sittings contained practically no indifferent matter, but some\nof them contained a good deal of irrelevant talk such as might have\ncome from a stranger to her, although her personal friends purported\nto be speaking ; and on these occasions, although the thread, so to say,\nof the personality was kept up, there was nothing that actually sug\ngested the actual presence of her friends. She has received at the\nsittings numerous correct statements of facts concerning herself and\nher friends, living and dead, and, among them, many which she regards\nas too personal for publication. Especially, allusions have been made\nto circumstances known to no person living but herself, yet known to\nthe person from whom they purported to come, and who had died,\nbetween one and two years previously,\nMiss E. G. W.'s Account of Sittings with Mrs. Piper.\nMy forty-five sittings with Mrs. Piper cover the period from November\n12th, 1886, to June 19th, 1889. In forty-one of these the control was taken,\nfor at least a part of the hour, by a personal friend whoso subjects of con\nversation, forms of expression, and ways of looking at things were distinctly\nunlike either Mrs. Piper's or Dr. Phinuit's. The clearly-marked personality\nof that friend, whom I will call T., is to me the most convincing proof of\nMrs. P.'s supernatural power, but it is a proof impossible to present to any\none else. Messages, in some instances characteristic, were received from\noff.\" H. : \" Was this referred to by Mrs. riper?\" W. : \"I have no remembrance\nof any such reference ; indeed, I do not think I had a sitting with Mrs. Piper after\nthe accident occurred.\"\nH. : \" How has your health been ? \" W. : \" Pretty good.\" H. : \" Have you had\na cold ?\" W, : \" Well, I had a cold in about the latter part of November, and it\nheld on so tenaciously that I thought I might have to go South.\" H. : \" When did\nyou recover from it ? \" W. : \" Well, it was worked off very slowly ; if I had to\nstate the time when I recovered from it, I should say, perhaps a month ago.\"\nFurther conversation made it clear that the accident to the dog occurred before\nMrs. Piper left America in 1889, but it appears that no members of Mr. W.'s family\nsaw Mrs. Piper between the time of the accident and Mrs. Piper's departure for\nEngland.\nMr. W. mentioned some incidents which had occurred at his own sittings, and\nstated that one of his daughters, then in Italy, had made careful note3 of her\nexperiences. This led to my obtaining an account from Miss W. herself.\n\f30 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nother friends, but no long-sustained conversations were held save with T.\nand Dr. Phinuit. T., who was, while living, a Congregational minister,\ntalked of religious subjects (of which Phinuit disclaimed either interest or\nknowledge), of professional matters, of our large circle of mutual acquaint\nances, and of many private affairs known only to himself and me.\nT. was a Western man, and the localism of using like as a conjunction\nclung to him, despite my frequent correction, all his life. At my sitting on\nDecember 16th, 1886, he remarked, \" If you could see it like I do.\" For\ngetful for the instant of changed conditions, I promptly repeated, \"As I\nilo.\" \"Ah,\" came the response, \"that sounds natural. That sounds like\nold times.\"\nMarch 1st, 1888, he requested, \"Throw off this rug,\" referring to a\nloose fur-lined cloak which I wore. I noted the word as a singular designa\ntion for such a garment, and weeks after recalled that he had once, while\nliving, spoken of it in the same way as I threw it over him on the lounge.\nFebruary 18th, 1887, T. remarked, \" I like your arrangement here,\"\nreferring to a new gown by a term which he was wont to use.\nMarch 2nd, 1887, came this : \"I never knew you had a little sister here.\nShe tells me she has been here a long time, ever since she was a little\ntoddling baby.\" Certainly not I, nor Mrs. P., who has children of her own,\nwould speak of a four months old child as a \" toddling baby.\" It is more\nthinkable of a man who, like T., never knew anything of young children.\nI have received from T., dictated through Mrs. P. to her husband and\nsent me by post, seven letters at intervals from November 29th, 1886, to\nJanuary 22nd, 1889. Each contains some unintelligible matter, but each\ncontains familiar allusions and the old-time opening and closing phrases,\neither of which is too long and individual to have been merely chanced upon.\nThe post-office address of the first is worth mention. Mrs. P. had learned\nfrom me neither name nor residence, nor had any other than my pet name,\nNellie, been given at the sittings. On November 16th, 1886, Dr. P. told\nme that T. was dictating a letter to me. \"How will you address it?\" I\nasked. \" T. knows your address and will give it to the medium.\" November\n29th, a friend, who had been sitting with Mrs. P. , brought me word that\nthe promised letter had been mailed to\u2014\nMiss Nellie Wilson,\nCare David Wilson,\nReading, Mass.\nBy applying at the post-office at Reading I was able to obtain the letter.\nI alter the names, but these points may be noted :\u2014\n1. My surname is given correctly.\n2. I have a cousin, David Wilson, of whose relationship and friendship\nT. was well aware. His home, however, has always been in New York.\n3. Reading was my home during my childhood and youth, but I removed\nfrom it thirteen years ago. I knew T. only subsequent to that removal.\n4. While living there I wrote my name with the diminutive, Nellie, but\nsince then have preferred to write my baptismal name Ella, or merely tho\ninitial E. T. was wont to use the initials merely.\nAt my next sitting, November 30th, I inquired about this mongrel address.\n\"T. was not strong enough,\" said Phinuit, \" to direct where the letter should\nbe sent, but he thought your cousin David would attend to your getting it.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 31\nYour other friends here helped us on the rest of the address.\" \" But they\nwould not tell you to send to Reading.\" \"Yes, they would, they did. It\nwas Mary told us that.\" \"Nonsense,\" said I, thinking of a sister of that\nname. \" Not Mary in the body. Mary in the spirit.\" \" But I have no such\nfriend.\" \" Yes, you have. It was Mary L.\u2014Mary E.\u2014Mary E. Parker told\nus that.\" I then recalled a little playmate of that name, a next door neighbour,\nwho moved away from Reading when I was ten years old, and of whose death\nI learned a few years later. I had scarcely thought of her for twenty years.\nThe \"E.\" in the name I have not verified.\nI quote two tests of partial clairvoyance. March 2nd, 1887, I was asked\nby my mother to inquire the whereabouts of two silver cups, heirlooms,\nwhich she had misplaced. Said Dr. P. : \" They are in your house, in a room\nhigher up than your sleeping room, in what looks to me the back part of\nthe house, but very likely I am turned round. You'll find there a large chest\nfilled with clothing, and at the very bottom of the chest are the cups. Annie\n[my mother's name] placed them there and will remember it.\" Returning\nhome I went to a room on the third floor at the front of the house, but\nremotest from the stairway, found the chest (of which I knew) and the con\ntents (of which I was ignorant) both as described, but no silver. Reporting\nthe message to my mother I learned that she had at one time kept the cups\nin that chest, but more recently had removed them.\nFebruary 11th, 1887, my sister L. wished me to ask Phinuit where she\nshould find her missing card-plate. To be thoroughly explicit, I took her\ncalling-card with me and placed it in Mrs. P.'s hand, inquiring, \" Where is\nthe plate from which this is engraved ?\" Phinuit replied, \"You will find it\nin a box with a brush and a bottle. The box is in the house where you live,\nin a drawer under something that looks like a cupboard or closet or some\nthing of that sort. There are soft things cluttered up in the drawer.\" L.\nand I searched together all possible places, and finally concluded that the\n\" cupboard or closet \" might be the stationary washstand in her bedroom\nwhich is set into a recess with shelves above and drawers below. The second\nof these three drawers, of whose contents I knew nothing, we found filled\nwith loose pieces of woollen and muslin, and under these pieces a small box.\nThe box contained specified box and bottle, but instead of L.'s card-plate her\nstencil-plate. We subsequently wondered that the mention of brush and\nbottle had not forewarned us of this mistake, but it had not.\nI am asked if I have any indications that Mrs. P. is ignorant of her\nutterances during the trance. These five instances may bear on that :\u2014\n1. November 26th, 1886, Phinuit, on taking control, tasted for several\nseconds and then began, \"The medium has been eating that nasty thing,\nwhat do you call it ? \" I had perceived no odour, but suggested \" onions.\"\n\"Yes, that's it, you must excuse it.\" After the trance I asked Mrs. P. if\nshe had eaten onions lately. She said she had yesterday, and asked was it\npossible that any unpleasantness lingered in her breath ?\n2. March 2nd, 1887, T. controlling, remarked, \"The medium's hand\nfeels numb. I can't use it well. It doesn't seem natural.\"1 I rubbed it a\ni At a sitting which I attended on February 20th, 1888, Phinuit declared that\none of his thumbs \" belonged to the medium,\" and added, \" I cannot move\nthat.\"\u2014R. H.\n\f32 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nlittle and got the acknowledgment, \" That helps it. \" I asked Mrs. P. later-\nif her hand was hurt, and she said, \"No,\" adding after a moment, \"I\njammed it slightly this morning, but the pain was gone long ago.\"\n3. At the same sitting T. narrated how a few days before when he was\ndictating a letter to me \"there were some things about her ears I didn't\nlike.\" \"Earrings?\" \"Yes. They got in my way and I couldn't hear\nwell. You never wore such things and I never did, so I asked the gentle\nman in her surroundings [Mr. Piper] to have them removed.\" This incident\nwas substantiated.\n4. More than once in the winter of 1886-1887 T. spoke gratefully of \" the\nmedium's great kindness in letting me come and talk with you.\" To this I\nalways assented. From my sitting of February 18th I quote, \" Tell me,\nhow is it about talking with me here ? Do you pay anything to come\nhere ? \"\n5. March 15th, 1887, T. observed, \" This medium is good and true. I\nam glad to say that because I used to think she was a fraud. Do you\nremember?\" \" No; I didn't know you ever said so\"\u2014thinking only of\ncommunications received through her. Why, yes, last summer, when\nyou sent her a lock of my hair. Don't you remember?\" I then recalled\nthat during T.'s fatal illness in June, 1886, I had won his reluctant consent\nto send Mrs. P. a lock of his hair. I first heard of her at that time, and\nfaintly hoped that a clairvoyant might diagnose a malady which physicians,\nhad failed to reach. The diagnosis proved worthless, and T. had freely\ncharacterised the whole thing as trickery and fraud. I have never mentioned\nthat correspondence to Mrs. P., and since I wrote her from a distant city,\nshe is not likely to have associated it with me.\nSomewhat analogous to the incident of the bruised hand is this :\u2014A\nfriend, H., was visiting me who during his childhood and youth had been\nparalysed throughout his left side. He had so far recovered that a slight limp\nand a little awkwardness in the use of the left hand were the only indica\ntions of the illness. H., interested in our account of Mrs. P., arranged for\na sitting, but, alone among the many whom I have sent to her, was disap\npointed ; the trance would not come on. He went again in the evening,\nOctober 23rd, 1887, and I went with him to establish communication. He\nhad a long and, he assured me, satisfactory conversation with Dr. Phinuit,\nduring which no allusion was made to his former invalidism, or to the failure\nof the morning. At my next sitting, Dr. Phinuit asked, \"Who was that\nhere with you the other day ? A fine fellow, but I found him very hard to\ntalk with. Some queer things about him. All the way down this side\n[indicating the left] I couldn't get hold of him or get any magnetism from\nhim. But I would not be so impolite as to tell him so.\" Unwonted reserve\nfor Dr. Phinuit !\nThese three cases suggesting clouded vision of physical things interested\nme :\u2014\n1. December 16th, 1886, I mentioned to T. that I had recently met D.,\na former acquaintance of his, and asked if he remembered him. \" Yes, I\nremember D., but not in your present surroundings, nor in X. [referring to a\nformer home]. It was in D. 's surroundings that I knew you first, but not in\nhis home. He has not a church, but a large house, an institution to take\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 33\ncharge of.\" My request for fuller particulars was met by a promise to think\nof the matter and tell me at my next visit. December 21st, T. introduced\nthe subject, saying, \" I was to remember about D. It was in his institution\nthat I met you first. I think the institution was for poor people, sick\npeople.\" \" No, that is wrong.\" \" I cannot tell why it seems to me like a\nhospital, unless because so many of the people that I'm working among here\nhave come from hospitals.\" I first met T. when he was visiting at a Western\ncollege, of which D. was president and I a teacher.\n2. February 11th, 1887, T. remarked, \" I saw you lately working at\nyour desk with your back toward the window, the light. But what is that\nlarge piece of furniture at the right of the door in your room ? \" For the\npurpose of misleading I suggested, \"A table?\" \"No, that is at the left.\"\nAfter several leading questions from me he concluded it might be the book\ncase, which it was. Question from me: \"If you see the furniture so\nindistinctly, are you quite sure whom you saw at the desk ? \" An emphatic\naffirmative, with a denial of any analogy between me and the book-case.\n3. Late in June, 1887, Mrs. Piper went yachting with us for an after\nnoon. At my next sitting, July 1st, T. said, \" I saw you with the medium\nthe other day riding along in a very large vehicle of some sort. I could not\nmake out what. It moved so quietly and gently, 'twas as if on a carpet.\nBut it was not. It was clear, and I could see into it.\" \" Was it a carriage?\"\n\" Oh, no ; larger than that. And it was not moving on the ground, either.\"\n\"A balloon, perhaps?\" \"No, I couldn't see as clearly as if it had been air.\"\n\" Well, if neither earth nor air, it must have been \" \" Water, of course.\nThat was it. You were in a boat. Strange that I could not see it ! \"\nThe scepticism of one, B., with whom he had much in common, had\nseemed a matter of concern to T. He spoke of it November 26th, 1886 : \" I\nremember how we used to talk about this [spirit-control], and how set against\nit B. was\u2014like a wall. He thinks so yet.\" December 16th, 1886, he again\nintroduced the matter, saying, \" I notice your father has a letter from B.\nHow strongly he holds his old notions. He's determined not to admit any\nthing in this, isn't he ? \" The letter, whose contents were correctly sum\nmarised, was received by my father that very morning. I did not know of\nits arrival until my return home after this sitting. In July, 1887, B. visited\nmy father and the two had a sitting with Mrs. P. At my next visit, August\n5th, T. thus spoke of it : \"I have seen B. He seems changed and so-\ninquisitive. I do not remember him so. But he seemed to think me\ndifferent.\" I learned afterward from my father that B.'s conversation had\nbeen a bombardment of questions.\nOn one occasion my mother went with my father to Mrs. P.'s. On\nmy next visit, August 15th, 1887, T. spoke of it with pleasure, but\nadded : \" This seemed so strange. A little while after she was here I heard\nher say to your father, ' It did not really seem like T.' It was on the piazza\nthat she said it. \" I verified this on reaching home. Nothing of the sort\nhad been said to me.\nJanuary 5th, 1888, I was told, \"Here is somebody who says he is your\ngrandfather. He is tall, wears glasses, and is smooth-shaven.\" \" Whioh\ngrandfather 1 \" \" He gives his name F.\" \" Yes, it must be my grandfather\nF., if smooth-shaven.\" \"Well, it is. But do you mean that your grand-\nD\n\f34 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nfather E. wears a beard?\" \"Yes.\" \"I think you must be mistaken.\"\n\"No ; I am sure that he did.\" \" I never see him so, and I see him often.\"\nMy grandfather E. died before my birth, but I felt sure that he had been\ndescribed to me as full-bearded, like his son. But my father, when appealed\nto, disappointed me. \" No, you are wrong,\" he said; \"I am like him in\nfigure and features, but not in cut of beard. He was always smooth-shaven.\"\nHere are the most significant prophecies. There have been others, ful\nfilled and unfulfilled\u2014about half of each.\nIn the autumn of 1886 my young brother, K., started in business. He had\nhad slight experience, had given no marked promise, and those who knew\nhim best were not confident of success. At my first sitting, November 12th,\n1886, Dr. Phinuit's first words were of K., calling him by name and assuring\nme that he was bound to get on ; there was no trouble about him. He would\ndo finely. At nearly every sitting during the winter Phinuit recurred to the\nsubject, asserting, with laughable emphasis, \" K.'s the fellow for me. He'll\nget on ; he'll get to the top. He may not care so much for books as some of\nyou, but he's sure to succeed.\" K., while not yet at \" the top,\" has wholly\ndisappointed the fears of his friends, and has established (March, 1891) an\ninfluential and profitable business.\nOn January 5th, 1887, T. brought me the message : \" N. is here and has\nsomething to tell you. She says O. is to be married in the spring.\" N. was\na friend who had died five years before, and whose widowed husband, O., I\nsaw not infrequently. \" Preposterous ! \" I replied. \" It cannot be N. who\ntells me that.\" \" She does not ask you to believe it. She simply asks you\nto hear it. She knows you would rather hear it from her than from any\nother source. And she would like, too, that you should remember it as a\nlittle test that it is she who is speaking to you.\" Then followed a somewhat\nextended conversation in which N. took positions which I was forced to\nadmit were characteristic. Her first assertion, however, was so violently\nimprobable to my mind that I attached little importance to it all. The\nprophesied marriage occurred, however, in the following June.\nIn the spring of 1888, an acquaintance, S., was suffering torturing\nilisease. There was no hope of relief, and only distant prospect of release.\nA consultation of physicians predicted continued physical suffering and\nprobably mental decay, continuing perhaps through a series of years. S.'s\n.daughter, worn with anxiety and care, was in danger of breaking in health.\n\"How can I get her away for a little rest?\" I asked Dr. Phinuit, May 24th,\n1888. \" She will not leave her father,\" was his reply, \" but his suffering is\nnot for long. The doctors are wrong about that. There will be a change\n.soon, and he will pass out of the body before the summer is over.\" His\n.death occurred in June, 1888.\nE. G. W.\nI have also received from Miss W. the accounts of several other\nincidents, the details of which she gave to me before writing her general\nreport. One of the communications from Phinuit that seemed specially\nisti iking in the first instance has lost much of its significance owing to\nfacts which I have ascertained from Miss W. The Rev. W. H. Savage,\nat a sitting on December 28th, 1888 (see Reports, Nos. 27 and 28),\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 35\nreceived a message for his brother, the Rev. M. J. Savage, purporting\nto come from the Rev. Robert West\u2014full name and description given\n\u2014regretting a certain article which he had written against the Rev.\nM. J. Savage in a paper called the Advance, and naming correctly the\ncause and the date of his death. At a sitting on January loth, 1889,\nthe R\u00abv. M. J. Savage also received a communication purporting to\ncome from the Rev. Robert West, in which the place of his burial and\nthe text on his tombstone were correctly given. All these circum\nstances were unknown to the sitters. Now, Miss W., it appears, was a\nfriend of the Rev. Robert West, and aware of the text on his tomb\nstone. The Rev. Robert West has purported to communicate directly\nwith her, without the intervention of Phinuit, and early in 1888\n(February 2nd) referred to \"a blue-eyed, brown-bearded man, about\nmy age [42], who comes here, named ' Savage,' \" and wished Miss W.\nto refresh his (West's) memory about Mr. Savage, whom he claimed he\nused to know in the West. Miss W. put some leading questions with\nthis object in view, and Mr. West then referred to the article in the\nAdvance, which Miss W. had not specially mentioned, but about which\nshe knew. There were also allusions, at her sittings in the early part\nof 1888, to the text on the tombstone and the place of burial. It\nseems clear, therefore, that all the information which was given to the\nRev. W. H. Savage and his brother might have been obtained previously\nfrom Miss W. without supposing any more than telepathy from the\nsitter.\nThe above is the simple outline of the case. The full details are\nsomewhat more complicated, and appear to be as follow :\u2014\nOn February 2nd, 1888, \"Mr. West\" gave to Miss W. a general\npersonal description of \" Savage \" which would suit well enough either\nM. J. Savage or W. H. Savage. Miss W. did not know whether the\ndescription was applicable or not, but supposed at the time that M. J.\nSavage was meant, for she did not know of the existence of his brother.\nBut Mr. West never knew M. J. Savage in the West, but he did know\nW. H. Savage there, both being Congregational ministers at the same\ntime in towns not very far apart in the State of Illinois. On May\n24th, 1888, \"Mr. West\" stated to Miss W. that he had (since February\n2nd, 1888) seen Mr. Savage and communicated with him. \"I had a\ntalk with Mr. Savage. Dr. Phinuit was talking with him, and I said\nto the doctor, ' I think I know that gentleman.' So he told Mr.\nSavage, who asked me to come. I told Mr. Savage about a good many\nthings in my life, about my illness, &c, reminded him of that note we\npublished. He remembered it very well, said he did not think it quite\nthe right thing, but was ready to overlook it.\"\nMr. M. J. Savage did not remember any such sitting, and\nin reply to my inquiry stated that he had no recollection of\nD 2\n\f36 Mr. R, Hodgson.\nattending any sitting between February 2nd and May 24th, 1888.\nI discovered, however, that during this interval Mr. Savage had\nvisited Mrs. Piper, not as the \" sitter,\" but as an officer of the\ncommittee of the A.S.P.R., accompanying the sitter and a steno\ngraphic reporter for the purpose of supervising and adding com\nments concerning incidents at the sitting which were not likely to be\nnoted by the reporter, and avoiding, as far as possible, communications\nto himself. He received no communication from the Rev. Robert\nWest at this sitting (March 7th), as I have ascertained from an exami\nnation of the stenographic report in my possession. Mr. W. H. Savage\nalso believes that he did not visit Mrs. Piper at all between those dates.\nIt is, of course, just possible that since Mr. M. J. Savage forgot that he\nhad any sitting at all with Mrs. Piper between the dates of February\n2nd and May 24th, 1888, whereas he was certainly present at an im\nportant official sitting between those dates, he might have also had\nanother sitting as alleged by \" Mr. West,\" though perhaps he was\nhardly likely to forget such a conversation as that described on May\n24th to Miss W. Recently (November, 1891) I questioned Phinuit\nabout this incident and quoted Mr. Savage's statement that no such\nconversation had occurred. Phinuit purported then to get into com\nmunication with \" Mr. West,\" and stated in explanation that it was\nprobably his (Phinuit's) fault, that Mr. West had given him the mes\nsage to deliver, and he had forgotten it, and told Mr. West that it\nwould be \" all right, or something of that sort,\" thus giving rise to\nanother misunderstanding on the part of Mr. West that Mr. Savage\nhad offered a communication in return. But this explanation seems\nsomewhat inadequate when we consider the explicit account given to\nMiss W. on May 24th by \" Mr. West.\"\nAgain, at Mr. M. J. Savage's sitting on January 15th, 1889,\nwhen he received froru \" Mr. West \" the information about the place\nof burial and the text on the tombstone, the Rev. C. L. Goodell\npurported to be present (Report, No. 27). Mr. Savage was unaware\nof his death, but afterwards ascertained that Mr. Goodell died early\nin 1886. Miss W. writes to me : \" Dr. C. L. Goodell was an\nacquaintance of mine. His name was mentioned to me (at a sitting\nwith Mrs. Piper) with a message of regards on December 16th, 1886,\nand several times thereafter.\" Dr. Goodell was also known to the\nRev. Robert AVest,\nTaken altogether, the incidents form a curious series of events.\nThe person unfamiliar with, and incredulous of, the possibilities of\ntrance states like Mrs. Piper's would naturally infer, on reading\nthe accounts given by the Rev. M. J. Savage and his brother,\nthat Mrs. Piper had \" worked up \" the cases of West and Goodell by\nordinary means of inquiry. The firm believer in \" spirit control \"\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 37\nwould probably conclude at ouce that the Rev. Robert West and Dr.\nGoodell were personally communicating. But while we cannot say that\n. this second view is absolutely untenable, there remains another expla\nnation, that Phinuit, drawing his information from Miss W. telepathi-\ncally and by conversation, and knowing (as Miss W., consciously, did\nnot know) that both M. J. Savage and his brother had talked with him\nand were likely to come again, stored up the information for future\nuse, and found the first favourable opportunity on the visit of W. H.\nSavage.\nIn the light of the foregoing incident we are, I think, bound\nto regard several other peculiar cases of which accounts have been\nfurnished to me by Miss W.\nOn March 23rd, 1887, Miss W. received a communication from\n\" Mr. West \" to this effect : \" Katy asks, Do you know Mabel\nFuller ? She lived in Lake City and was drowned there some six or\neight years ago, while skating on the lake with John Gerster.\" On\nMarch 31st she was further told: \"It was in Lake Pepin she was\ndrowned with Gerster some seven or eight years ago. Her father's\nname is John.\"\nMr. W. also had sittings with Mrs. Piper about this time, and in\nreply to his inquiries the information concerning the above incident\ngradually became more definite in successive sittings. Unfortunately\nno record was made of the actual changes, &c, but Mr. W. is sure that\nhe finally had the following statements to go upon :\u2014That a boy named\nFred Guernsey, whose father kept a drug-store in Lake City, was\ndrowned in Lake Pepin while skating in company with a girl, and that\ntheir bodies were found clasped together in the lake. He could not\nget the name of the State, and several States contain a Lake City, but\nthe Lake Pepin pointed to the Lake City in Minnesota, and he ac\ncordingly wrote to Mr. Guernsey to this address on May 20th, 1887\nand received the following letter in reply :\u2014\nDrugs, Books, Stationery, Notions,\nFancy Goods, Wall Paper.\nA. T. Guernsey.\nLake City, Minn.\nMay 24th, 1887.\n... In reply to your inquiries under date of the 20th, would say that\nI lost a son by drowning December 13th, 1878, while skating on Lake\nPepin in company with Miss Florence E. Wyckoff, daughter of Rev. Samll\nWyckoff, at that time pastor of the Presbyterian Church of this place. Both\nwere lost. His name was Porter Brewster Guernsey.\nA. T. Guernsey.\nOn July 1st, 1887, Miss W. drew the attention of the \"control\"\nto the mistake in the name Mabel Fuller, acquainting him probably, as\n\f33 Mr. Ii. Hodgson.\nshe thinks, with the contents of the letter received from Mr. Guernsey.\nAn explanation of the mistake was offered to the effect that Mabel\nFuller had lived in Lake City, was a friend of Miss Wyckoff, and was\nthe daughter of a Baptist minister there, Miss Wyckoff being also the\n(laughter of a minister. It was not ascertained at the time whether\nthis explanation was founded on facts or not, and my own letters to\nLake City received no reply. I have at last, however, received the\nfollowing statement from one of our members, Mr. H. VV. Smith :\u2014\nSt. Paul, Minn., Narember 30th, 1891.\n. . . You ask as to the identity of Miss Mabel Fuller, &c., all of\nwhich I will try to place before you in the following. Your letter of March\n!lth to A. T. Guernsey is also before me\u2014temporarily in my possession\u2014anil\n1 also attempt to cover the questions therein contained. Before me also are\ntwo letters, copies of which I enclose, which Mr. Guernsey states reached\nhim from a party claiming to be W. H. W. The originals are written in a\nbeautiful cultivated hand, well punctuated ; otherwise my copies are accurate.\nMr. A. T. Guernsey is a druggist doing business at the coiner of Selby-\navenue and Dale-street, in St. Paul, Minn., having removed with his family\nfrom Lake City, Minn., some three years ngo. The following statement.'!\nwere made to me this evening by said Mr. Guernsey, while in his presence, by\noral declaration. He is the father of Porter Brewster Guernsey, who was\ndrowned in Lake Pepin in the vicinity of Lake City, Minn., in the evening\n(not the afternoon or day) of December loth, 1878. He (young Guernsey)\nwas skating in company with Florence E. Wyckoff at the time, and she was\ndrowned with him. Miss Wyckoffs father was the Presbyterian minister at\nLtke City, Minn., having removed from Portage, Wisconsin. The former\nBaptist minister at Lake City was a Mr. Fuller, who removed to Litchfield,\nMinn., two or three years before Mr. Wyckoff or any of his (Wyckoff's)\nfamily arrived. Besides this strong indication that the Fullers and Wyckoffs\nwere not acquainted, there is independent evidence which is nearly conclu\nsive. There was no such person as Mabel Fuller residing in Lake City or\nanywhere around, or known there, before, at the time, or subsequent to the\nabove-mentioned drowning. Mr. Fuller had two daughters, neither of whom\nwas drowned, neither knew the Wyckoffs, neither of them was named Mabel,\nboth, and all the family, moved away, as above stated, two or three years\nprior to Wyckoffs arrival, and now reside at Litchfield, Minn. Porter\nBrewster Guernsey and Florence E. Wyckoffwere drowned and died together\non one and the same occasion. The evidence is that Guernsey was trying to\nassist Miss Wyckoff, when both went down together, and the fact is that when\nfound the bodies were attached ; that is to say, Mr. Guernsey had hold of\nMiss Wyckoffs arm at death and the bodies had remained so. I have already'\ngiven you the date of drowning. Young Guernsey's name is correctly given\nabove, and Fred Guernsey (see Mr. W.'s letter) is not correct. No such per\nson as Fred Guernsey was drowned. Mr. A. T. Guernsey never saw, nor cor\nresponded with, nor heard Rev. Robert West ; never subscribed to the\nAdvance, and believes, therefore, his name never came to their notice. He\nhad read the Advance, and recollects Rev. West as a writer.\nAgain, Miss W., at a sitting on March 31st, 1887, was informed\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 30\nby \"Mr. West\" that he was very busy just then with the care (,f a\nWilliam N. (giving the name in full), who had passed out of the body\n\" by his own act, from some Western City.\" William N. wanted to\nsend a message to his wife Lulu. Shortly after this, Miss W. ascer\ntained that a bearer of the name given had been in . . . in\nSt. Paul, Minnesota, and had committed suicide. I learn (November\n29th, 1891) from Mr. H. W. Smith, who sent me the information\nconcerning the Guernsey incident, that William Pi. N. committed\nsuicide in 1883, and that his wife's name is Louise. My informant\nadds that \" the remains were, or were to be, taken to Lake City,\nMinn., for interment.\"\nNow, taking the view which I do of Mis. Piper's trance (and\ntherefore rejecting the supposition which many of my readers will\nnaturally make, that Mrs. Piper in her waking state had consciously\n\" got up \" the information given), there are at least four hypotheses\nwhich might be suggested for the \"Guernsey\" and \"W. N.\" incidents.\n1. The hypothesis of \"spirit-control.\" But in this case it semis\ndifficult to account for the mistakes made in connection with the\n\" Guernsey \" incident.\n2. The hypothesis suggested by the \" West-Savage \" incident, that\nsome other person to whom the facts were at least partially or\n\" unconsciously \" known had previously had a sitting with Mrs. Piper,\nand that Phinuit had obtained his information from this other sitter.\nIt is curious that the statements in both cases concerned events in\nMinnesota. Possibly the sitter came from that State, or was specially\ninterested in matters occurring there.\n3. The hypothesis that Miss W. or her father had casually seen\na brief account of the ciicumstances in some newspaper, and either\nhad forgotten them afterwards or perhaps in the first instance had\nnever consciously noticed them (compare the exper iences of Miss X.,\nVol. V., pp. 507-8), and that Phinuit had niched them telepathically\nfrom their subconsciousnesses.\n4. The hypothesis that Mrs. Piper herself had thus casually seen\nthese items of news without noticing them, but that the \" Phinuit\npersonality \" had noticed them and reproduced them afterwards as\ntests. This and the two previous hypotheses seem to tit most naturally\nwith the scantiness and partial incorrectness of the statements made\nabout the \" Guernsey \" incident. It is a common thing to find an\nitem of news in a paper in the form of a despatch prefaced by the\nname of a city without the name of the State.i Thus a telegraphic\ni In making inquirics about remarkable stoiips which have appeared in news\npapers, I have several times been inconvenienced by this fact. There are numerous\ninstances where towns, frequently important ones, of the same name are found in\ndifferent States.\n\f40 Mr. R. Hodgson.\ndespatch might appear somewhat in this way :\u2014Lake City.\u2014A boy\nnamed Guernsey, whose father keeps a drug-store in this city, was\ndrowned to-day in Lake Pepin while skating in company with a girl,\u2014\nifec. AVe must note further that the Christian name of the boy was\nfirst given as John and afterwards as Fred, his first names being in\nreality Porter Brewster. These errors would be rather remarkable for\neither the boy himself or his girl-companion to make, and if we add to\nthese the further facts that the name of the State was not obtainable,\nand that the name of the girl who was drowned, from whom,\napparently, the information purported to come, was given as Mabel\nFuller instead of Florence E. Wyckoff, there remains practically no\nevidence whatever for the identity of the supposed \" spirits \" whose\nbodies were drowned.\nAfter writing the above I made further inquiries of Miss AV., who\nsays in reply :\u2014\n' ' The acquaintance who introduced me to Mrs. Piper in 1886 was a St.\nPaul business man. He had then had several sittings with her, but has had\nfew since that time. He could, if he would, tell you much of interest about\nher, but he would not. . . . My St. Paul friend was the person\nthrough whom I verified the account of William K.'s suicide. I think he\nknew him personally\u2014certainly knew of him.\"\nMiss W. also states that she remembers telling her St. Paul friend\n(now abroad) of the Guernsey incident, and \" he had no recollection of\nhaving heard of the matter.\"\nThis additional information certainly seems to make the second of\nthe above hypotheses so much more probable than the others that I \u2022\nallow the others to remain as suggestions only because of the next\nincident to which I turn, which is also an outcome of the W. sittings.\nIn May, 1888, Mr. W. was told by his daughter \"control\" that she\nwas intimate (in the \" spirit-world \") with a little girl whose father's\nname was X. Miss W. received further details on May 24th,\n1888, purporting to come from Katy through \"Mr. West.\" \" Gracie\nX. here about four years. Her father is William X., who keeps a\nshop on Winter-street (Boston), sells furnishings, buttons, fancy goods,\ntrimmings. Katy describes her dress, in open work stockings, high\nbuttoned boots, white dress with two frills round the bottom and falling\njust below the knees, sash of blue ribbon tied a little at one side of the\nback, long, light flowing hair, crimped by being braided, smoothed\nback from her forehead and parted off from each side and tied here\n(the back of the top of the head indicated by a gesture) with a ribbon\nand falling down behind. She is not so old as Katy. She was ill with\nmembranous diphtheria. She wants you to tell her papa about this\nand see what he says. She was an only child.\"\nA1r. AV. walked down Winter-street and found a shop there corre-\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 41\nsponding with the name of X., but not William X., and he made no in\nquiry at that time. Miss W. afterwards inquired for William X. at the\nshop and found that he was or had been a junior member of the firm,\nbut was engaged in another business in Devonshire-street. She found\nhim there, and was informed that the statements concerning his daughter\nwere correct. The description of his daughter's dress was accurate, but\nhis daughter's grave was in Forest Hills Cemetery, and there was a\nstatue of his daughter there dressed as described. His daughter, he\nsaid, was wont to wear blue. Miss W. questioned Mrs. Piper concern\ning her knowledge of Forest Hills Cemetery, which is in one of the\nsuburbs of Boston, and Mrs. Piper recalled that she had several years\npreviously visited this cemetery on a drive, but she could not recall\nanything about the statue.\nI questioned Mrs. Piper about her visit to the cemetery, and she\nstated that she accompanied a lady, Mrs. E., to the cemetery, that they\nwent in a horse-car, and walked in the cemetery itself ; that some time\nafter Miss W. told her about the statue she visited the cemetery again,\non purpose to see the statue, that she could not recall having ever seen\nit before, and that Mrs. E.'s lot is in another part of the cemetery.\nMiss Edmunds has visited the cemetery and furnished me with a\ndetailed description of the X. lot, from which I extract the following\npassages :\u2014\nOn the upright between the top and lower steps is engraved \" Wm. H.\nX.\" In the centre of the lot is a large grey granite monument .\nforming a pedestal for the statue of a woman in flowing draperies, full size,\nthe whole being about twenty feet. ... In the front is engraved in\nlarge letters \"X .\" On the left hand side of the monument [and not\nseen when directly facing the monument from the front of the lot] . . .\nis \"children of William H. and Emily D. C. X. Grace Sherwood, June 5th,\n1876\u2014November 11th, 1880.\" [Below this is a space as though for one or\nmore other names.] ... To the left of the large monument is the\nstatue of a beautiful child, about three feet high, in pure white marble,\nstanding on a pedestal, only a few inches from the ground, which is decorated\nwith leaves. . . . Her left hand is holding her sash, and in her right\nhand are a few flowers, held down in front. The sash is plain, in loose folds\nbelow the waist and tied at the back in a large bow ; and the dress, apparently\nof fine white muslin, beautifully and closely embroidered (not \"open\" work).\nThe front and back down to the sash has a broad embroidered band, and the\nskirt below the sash is beautifully worked. The hair is tied with a ribbon,\nwith large bow and ends falling back from the top of the head, straight\nfringe over forehead. The whole statue is enclosed in a glass case.\n(\"Gracie \" seems to be the only one as yet buried in the lot.) . . .\nI have also visited the lot myself, and add some further details\nwhich were brought out also in drawings made by Miss Edmunds of\nthe statue, and which should be compared with the statements made to\nMiss W. at her sitting. The boots are \" high-buttoned,\" and the dress\n\fi2 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nfalls ''just below the knees,' out the sash is tied exactly in the middle\nof the back. There is no sign of any \"openwork\" about the stockings,\nand there appear to be no frills round the bottom of the dress. There\nis no indication on the lot as to the cause of Gracie's death. She had\nbeen dead not \" about four years,\" as stated in the communication, but\nbetween seven and eight years. The name Gracie appears in large\nletters on the pedestal of the statue.\nIn reply to my further inquiries, Miss W. writes on November 9th,\n1891 :\u2014\nI have no notes of my conversation with Mr. X. My recollection is that\nhe said Gracie was at her death the only child ; that another had been born\nsince. He assented to the description as correct, at the same time saying\nthat the statue on the grave probably gave Mrs. P. her information.\nWhether I quoted to him the \"open-worked stockings\" and \"sash tied on\none side,\" and he failed to notice the discrepancy, or whether I gave him only\nmy recollection of the description, I do not remember. I should doubt, how\never, that I omitted both items. Should you find Mr. X., you may care to\nask him about this \" test \" which I find in my notes for June 21st, 1888. It\nseemed so intrinsically improbable that I never cared to inquire. \"Gracie\nX. is glad you have been to see her papa, and wants you to ask him if he\nremembers a little light blue silk dress with white lace that her mamma made\nher. She knows about her little sister, but she does not know her name\n[apparently in reply to my inquiry]. She will go to the house, a little way\nout from this city, with trees all round it, and find out.\"\nIt has not yet been ascertained whether these further statements\nare true or not, and, even if true, it is, of course, possible that they may\nhave baen obtained from some other sitter, a relative or friend of the\nX. family.\nReverting to our four hypotheses (p. 39), it is clear that not only\n(2), but (3) or (4) might be the actual explanation of the Gracie X.\nincident ; even if we suppose that neither Mrs. Piper, nor Miss W.,\nnor Mr. W. had ever seen the grave in Forest Hills Cemetery.\nIt is not improbable, e.g., that some account of the statue appeared in\na newspaper, together with some statement about Mr. X. and the\nmanner of his daughter's death. This account may have been read,\nand afterwards completely forgotten, by Mrs. Piper or the sitters, but\nlingering still in the \" subconscious \" mind, it may have formed the\nsource of the information given out by the trance personality. It\ncertainly seems remarkable that the dress of Gracie should be described\nwith such minute particularity, unless the statue in some way formed\nthe starting point of the communication. On the other hand, however,\nan advocate of the \"spirit\" hypothesis may urge that the very\ncircumstances in connection with the dross that led Mr. X. to place the\nstatue on his child's grave may be held in very definite remembrance by\nGracie herself. But, on this hypothesis, how did the mistake of four\nyears instead of eight years as the interval since her death originate 1\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 43\nTaken together, I think it must be conceded that these cases which\nMiss W. has given me, in addition to her general report, do not in\nthemselves furnish any prixif of the \" spirit \" hypothesis. Miss W.'s\nopinion as to the personality of her friend T. I regard as valuable, but\nit should be noticed that her mother, at the single sitting which she\nhad with Mrs. Piper, was not equally impressed with the T. control.\n\" It did not really seem like T.\" The incident of this remark, made to\nMr. W. by Mrs. W. on their piazza, was mentioned at her next sitting\nto Miss W., who was ignorant of the circumstances. This apparently\ngoes beyond thought-transference from the sitter. So also does the\nmore striking instance of Mr. W.'s receipt of a letter from B., of which\nMiss W. was informed at her sitting on December 16th, 1886, with a\ncorrect reference to its contents. These cases are, of course, explicable\non the hypothesis of telepathy from the mind of a distant living person\n(Mr. W.) ; and the cases of the \"silver cups\" and the \"card-plate \"\nperhaps strengthen this explanation, as the details communicated t(r\nMiss W., though unknown to her, were, presumably, known to her\nmother rmd sister respectively, and did not include the information of\nwhich tliey were\u2014consciously \u2014ignorant, and which Miss W. specially\nsought, viz., the actual whereabouts of the missing objects. Omitting\nfor the present the prophecies mentioned in Miss W.'s report, it would\nseem that the T. \"control \" presented marked characteristics of the friend\nit purported to be; showed specific knowledge of private matters known\nonly to that friend and the sitter ; showed a knowdedge of facts of whic h\nhe was reminded by the sitter, and in turn reminded the sitter of facts\ntemporarily forgotten by her ; made some mistakes in matters once\nknown to the friend, and remembered well by the sitter, and told the\nsitter of facts not known to her and afterwards verified. Is it probable\nthat Miss W.'s friend was in some sense actually communicating with\nher, or was the T. personality fictitiously represented by Phinuit ? Or,\nshall we put it ' rather, does Mrs. Piper's secondary personality\nfictitiously represent itself as (or believe itself to be) Phinuit, T., and\nvarious other \" controls \" ?\nI have myself witnessed five \" controls \" besides Phinuit. At one\nof my earliest sittings, I believe the third, Mrs. Piper became entranced,\nand yet, as I thought, no one spoke for some minutes. Finally my\nattention was drawn to a very low whispering sound which I was con\nscious had been continuing for some time, and on bending my head I\ncaught the repetition of my Christian name, with the statement that\nthe speaker, who purported to be \" Q.\" (see p. 9), was too weak to talk\nany more. Shortly afterwards Phinuit came to the front in the usual\nway. About a year later, Phinuit, in connection with an inquiry that I\nwas making, had asserted (wrongly, as afterwards appeared) that a\nparticular person was in Denver, Colorado. I wished to know whether\n\f44 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nPhinuit could not visit Denver then and there and become quite sure\nof his statements. He said he could, it would take him about five\nminutes, and in the meantime the medium was to \" leave the room and\nhave a change of surroundings and be freshened up.\" Mrs. Piper came\nout of trance. I told her of the circumstances. She left the room and\nreturned in a few minutes, and immediately became again entranced.\nTo my surprise the first words were, \" I'm Commodore Vanderbilt,\"\n.and then followed some general statements about Vanderbilt's life\nwhich I cannot recall. I inquired how it was that he came when I\nexpected Dr. Phinuit. \" Dr. Phinuit said he had to go off in a hurry\nand didn't know whether he could be back in time. If he didn't get\nback he said I was to come and talk to you till he came.\" The style\nwas curiously different from that of Phinuit, and after a short talk,\nsuggesting the fragmentary conversation which one might hold with a\nstranger while waiting for dinner, the alleged \" Commodore \" said,\n*' Here's Dr. Phinuit, I'm going, good-bye.\" After a pause came the\ncharacteristic Phinuit, and I inquired how it was that he could take\nthe place of Commodore Vanderbilt so easily.\n\" Oh ! I said, ' Commodore Vanderbilt, I want to speak to you.' He\ncame out and I popped in.\" \" What sort of a fellow is he ? \" \" Oh ! he's a\ngood sort of fellow; but I don't care about him very much.\" \"Why?\"\n\" Oh ! he swears.\"\nVanderbilt is mentioned both by Mrs. Piper (p. 46) and Phinuit\n(e.g., in sitting on June 9th, 1888) as among the early \" controls.\"\nI have also had several experiences with the \" E. control.\" (See\nProceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 493, 516-7, 524, 552-3, and 656.) This\nbegan by alleged messages from \" E.\" through Phinuit at a sitting on\nMarch 15th, 1889, with Professor and Mrs. James. On March 22nd,\n1889, the mother of Mrs. James received through Phinuit a message\nfrom \"E.\" for Professor James. A few days later \" E.\" purported to\ncontrol directly at a sitting where a friend of mine, Mrs. Y. (unknown\nto \" E.\"), was present, giving name, &c, and saying that he had heard\nmy name and found that the \" conditions \" of Mrs. Y. were specially\nfavourable for his \"controlling.\" With Mrs. Y., Professor James and\nmyself both witnessed this supposed \"control \" afterwards. The language\nwas not at all like that used by the living \" E.,\" who was well known to\nProfessor James and myself, though there were occasionally reminders,\nas it were, not in words, but in ideas, of his manner and thought.\nThus he earnestly desired that tests should be provided by another\nfriend who had known him most intimately ; but, on the other hand,\nwhen the test questions were obtained and presented the answers were\neither not forthcoming or were wrong. The whole thing rather\nsuggested a simulation by Phinuit, though a specific question of my\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 4.5\nown was correctly answered, and other matters were alluded to which\nshowed knowledge of some events personal to \" E.\" and myself.\nFurther, the full name and occupation, when living, of another person,\n\" Z.,\" were mentioned by the \" E.\" control, as well as the fact that\n\"Z.\" had died before \" E.\" The name of \" Z.\" was first mentioned\nincidentally. \" E.\" said that he himself was very much confused, but\nthat he had met \" Z.\" and found \"Z.\" in a still more confused state,\nalthough \"Z.\" had been longer in the \"other world.\" The rest of the\ninformation was given in reply to our inquiries. The statements made\nwere afterwards verified, and neither Mrs. Y., nor Professor James, nor\nmyself knew (consciously) anything about such a person. I was the only\none who was likely to have known anything about him, and it is almost\ncertain that, years previously, I had heard of his name and position ;\nbut it was improbable, though quite possible, that I had heard of his\ndeath. It was probable also that \" E.\" had known him personally.\nThis incident was the only case where any knowledge was at that time\nshown concerning matters which the sitters were unable to recall,\nand it may have been drawn from my subconsciousness or from the-\nmind of some other living person. If we assume that this control\nwas the \" make-up \" of Mrs. Piper's secondary personality, it apparently\ninvolved some very subtle use of information drawn telepathically from\nat least the minds of the sitters, and at the same time the most extra\nvagant ignorance and confusion concerning other facts, some of which\nwere known to the sitters, and which we should expect to be vivid in\nthe remembrance of \" E.\"\nSeveral times in reply to my request Phinuit had promised to bring\nseveral other persons to \"control\" in succession, and on November 7th,.\n1889, after Phinuit's voice had died away, another \"control\" started,\npurporting to be a friend of \" E.\" and to be a German. Beyond this\nthe words uttered, including the name, were almost entirely unintel\nligible. This \" manifestation,\" which lasted a very short time, and was\nnot at all like Phinuit, was followed by the \" Mrs. Walsh \" control,\nwhich I have described in Report 16. This was decidedly sui generis,\nand strongly suggestive of Mrs. Walsh (the aunt of Professor James.\nSee Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 656). I have heard of several other\n\"controls,\" purporting to be relatives of sitters who regard their\nexperiences as too private for publication, and I think it probable that\nsome of these may now be, whatever they were in their incipient\nstages, fairly good personations. On any hypothesis, perhaps, we should\nexpect such personations to improve. Phinuit himself is much superior\nto what he was four and a-half years ago, though he has remained\nthroughout the same characteristic personality, and his origin, I venture\nto think, is still open to doubt.\n\f4G Mr. R. Hodgson.\n\u00a7 7. Mrs. Piper's Early Trances.\nC Much light might be thrown on this problem of Phinuit's origin,\nAnd thus also on that of the other \" controls,\" did we possess a\nstenographic report of what ensued on Phinuit's first appearance as\nMrs. Piper's trance personality, but I have been unable to obtain\nany satisfactory accounts of Mrs. Piper's early trances. Mrs. Piper\nherself has given me what information she could. In reply to inquiries\nin January, 1888, she informed me that her husband's father and\nmother had been impressed by a sitting which they had with a\nmedium in 1884, and persuaded her to try consultation with a medium\nwho gave medical advice. She was at that time suffering from a\ntumour. She visited Mr. J. R. Cocke, a blind medium, also a\n\" developer \" of mediums. He professed to be controlled by a French\nphysician whose name was pronounced Finny. While there, she felt\ncurious twitchings, and thought she might become completely uncon\nscious. On a second visit to Mr. Cocke he placed his hands on her\nhead, and shortly after she became unconscious. As she was losing\nconsciousness she was aware of a flood of light and saw strange faces,\n\u2022and a hand moving before her. The \" flood of light \" she had ex\nperienced once before, a few months previously ; it immediately pre\nceded a swoon, caused by a sudden blow on the side of the head.\nWhen she lost consciousness on the occasion of her second visit to Mr.\nCocke, she was said to have been controlled by an Indian girl who\ng.ive the name \" Chlorine,\" and to have given a remarkable test to a\nstranger who was present. She had several more sittings with Mr.\nCocke, and was again controlled, apparently on each occasion by\n\" Chlorine.\" On her second visit to Mr. Cocke he professed to be\ncontrolled by John Sebastian Bach. After this she tried sitting at\nhome with her relatives and friends. Phinnuit (sic) \"controlled\" first,\nAnd since then regularly, but she was also controlled at occasional\ntimes by Mrs. Siddons, Bach, Longfellow, Commodore Vanderbilt, and\nLoretta Ponchini. It was said that \" Mrs. Siddons \" recited a scene\nfrom Macbeth, Longfellow was said to have written some verses, and\nLoretta Ponchini (who purported to be an Italian girl) to have made\nsome drawings. These verses and drawings have not been preserved. )\nI requested a lady member of our Society, who is a shorthalid\nreporter, and personally acquainted with Mrs. Piper and her family, to\nmake some inquiries of Mr. James M. Piper (Mrs. Piper's father-in-law)\nconcerning the earlier \"trances.\" The following is her account of Mr.\nPiper's statements :\u2014\nMr. Piper said that the first time Mrs. Piper went to Dr. Cocke's she\nwent for medical advice, and was told she would make a remarkable medium\n(she went to see if she had cancer).\nThe second time she visited Dr. Cocke she went under control and wrote\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 47\na message. Mr. Piper only accompanied her on those two occasions. Mrs.\nPiper herself only went a few times. She was first controlled by Chlorine,\n.and I asked Mr. Piper distinctly if the names of any of her controls were\nmentioned in her presence at the seances before she professed to be con\ntrolled by them, and he said, positively, No.i\nSebastian Bach said he was the one to \"form her band,\" and Chlorine\nwas the principal control for a long time for outside sitters, and Loretta\nPonchini and Mrs. Siddons, and one or two others, used to come at first for\nfamily sittings only and not for outsiders.\nDr. Phinuit only came at first to give medical advice. He \"didn't care\nto come for other matters,\" as he thought them \"too trivial.\"\nFinally Sebastian Bach said they were going to concentrate all their powers\non Phinuit, and he became ultimately the chief control.\nMr. Piper says that there is no question but that it is the same Phinuit\nor personality who controls Dr. Cocke, no matter how their names are spelt.\nPhinuit said at first that he was permitted to come through Mrs. Piper,\nand for quite a while he used to speak of a \" blind medium \" and of things\nthat had happened at the blind medium's, and would speak of certain persons\nwho had been at the blind medium's and would describe them. And Mr.\nPiper had asked Dr. Cocke if such persons were with him at such a time\nanswering to Phinuit's description, and he said Yes.\nQMr. Cocke is a professional medium. I visited him myself, accom\npanied by a friend\u2014not giving any names. He purported to go into\ntrance and give medical diagnoses. His diagnoses of my friend and\nmyself were completely wrong, and there was nothing of any sort, in\nvoice, words, gestures, ifec, about this supposed \" trance personality \"\nwhich in the least degree resembled Mrs. Piper's Phinuit. I was\ninformed, in reply to my inquiry, that the control was a \"Dr. Finny\"\n(so pronounced), but I forbore to press further questions, as my inquiry\nappeared to me to be received with a certain amount of resentment.\nBut I may have misjudged Mr. Cocke in this, since at a later period he\ngave some information to my assistant Miss Edmunds, when he found\nthat she had called in the interests of the S.P.R. He stated that he\nhad a full history of his \" control \" written out which he did not mean\nto divulge until he published it himself. But he was willing to state\nthat his control was Albert G. Finnett (pronounced Fin'-ne), a French\nman, who had studied medicine a little as a \" barber's surgeon.\" He\nclaims to be \"no one in particular.\" When \" controlling \" Mr. Cocke\nhe gives medical diagnoses and prescribes medicines. Mr. Cocke stated\nfurther that Albert G. Finnett also speaks French fluently, but he\nexplained that he had studied French thoroughly himself when at\n.school, and that, though not by any means a French scholar now, he\nunderstands it fairly well. )\ni A lady who had been at Sir. Cocke's \" circle \" at the same time as Mrs. Piper\n.stated, in reply to my inquiry, that all the early \"controls \" of Mrs. Piper had been\npreviously mentioned in Mrs. Piper's presence. This lady, however, declined later\nto give me any written statement on the subject.\u2014R. H.\n\f4S Mr. R. Hodgson.\nI have ascertained from several persons who attended some of Mrs.\nPiper's early sittings that Phinuit's name was originally pronounced\nFinny or Fin'-ne (see Report, No. 39) ; but I do not know of any\n\" authentic \" spelling of his name before the incident referred to at the\nclose of the following account received by me from Mrs. Piper on\nSeptember 23rd, 1890. Mrs. Piper had given me an oral account of\nthis incident a long time previously, but I was unable to find any\nrecord of it among my notes.\nIn reply to your several letters of recent date, asking for information in\nregard to my family history and other matters, I will say that I have taken\nspecial pains to get the information you desire, and the facts about my family\nI feel certain are absolutely correct.\n1st. Whether there has been in my family any phenomena similar to my\ntrance ?\nI know of nothing of the kind, except in the case of a younger brother\nwho has been all his life somewhat of an invalid. He has a nervous,\ntemperament, although the physicians say he has no regular nervous disease.\nHe has several times been entranced, but the fact is known to no one outside\nof his immediate family, and he would positively refuse to submit to any\ninvestigation by strangers.\n2nd. Whether there has been any nervous disease of any kind, any\ninsanity or crankiness of any sort, on either my mother's or father's side ?\nNone at all. My grandfather, on my father's side, died of old age, at the\nage of ninety. My grandmother is now living. They had twelve children,\neight of whom are living, and the rest died in infancy. My grandfather on\nmy mother's side died of heart disease at about eighty years of age. My\ngrandmother died suddenly in bed at an advanced age, over eighty, being in\nfull possession of all her faculties up to the time of her death. They also\nhad twelve children, six boys and six girls. Of these, one uncle died in\ninfancy, two uncles are now living, and the remaining three died of heart\ndisease at a mature age. Of my aunts, one died in childhood of hemorrhage,\none of cancer, and one of diabetes in middle age ; my mother and two aunts\nare now living.\n3rd. Did Phinuit ever give the last name, Scliville, to any person before\nthe sitting which you and Miss R. had together ?\nYes, he had several times given the name to Mr. Piper.\n4th. Can I give you the date of my marriage, and the date of my eldest\nchild's birth, and the date of my first experiences in trance ?\nI was married October 6th, 1881. My first child was born May 16th,\n1884. My second child was born October 7th, 1885. My first experience of\nbeing in trance was on the 29th of June, 1884. I remember this date\ndistinctly, from its being two days after my first birthday following the birth\nof my first child. I consulted a certain medium for medical advice on a\nSaturday, and during the interview was partially unconscious for a few\nmoments. The next day, Sunday, I attended a circle at the house of this\nsame medium, being urged to do so by friends who were curious to see if\nanything further would develop, and went into a trance. What took place at\nthat time I have previously explained to you.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 49\n5th. Can I describe the circumstances of my seeing the name Phinuit\nwritten out for the first time, giving the date as nearly as possible, and, of\ncourse, telling exactly what I saw written ?\nAs near as I can recollect, it was several months after the birth of my\nsecond child, which was in October, 1885. I had not, of course, been giving\nsittings for a considerable length of time. It was in the evening, soon after\nI had retired, and before I had fallen asleep at all. The room was quite\ndark. Then I suddenly saw light. I said to Mr. Piper, \"Do you see a\nlight ?\" He said, \"Why, no, what is the matter ? Are you going into a\ntrance ?\" I replied no, that I was my natural self, but that the room was full\nof light. He said that he saw nothing. I said, \" Wait a minute ; I sec\nsomething \" ; and just then I saw on the wall beside my bed the letters\n\"Dr.,\" a capital D and small r and a period, just as the abbreviation is\nordinarily written. Then I saw the letters \" P-h-i-n,\" but could see nothing\nmore. I arose, got a light, and placed it so that it would shine on the same\nspot on the wall to see what effect it would produce, but there was nothing\nlike what I had just seen.\nWhether the letters P-h-i-n were given to or suggested by any\nsitter prior to this \" hallucination \" of Mrs. Piper, I do not know.\nThe spelling given to me both by Mrs. Piper and Phinuit in 1887 was\nPhinnuil, and I incline to think that the present spelling Phinuit is\ndue indirectly to an error of my own. Forgetting the spelling as\noriginally given to me, and being frequently asked by persons who\nwere interested in Mrs. Piper's sittings how Phinuit was spelt, I not\nonly got into the habit of spelling it with a single n myself, but, as I\nbelieve, caused many sitters and other persons to spell it with a single\nn. I was never confident of this spelling, but did not for a long time\nrefer to my original notes. The waking Mrs. Piper herself in this\nway became familiarised with the spelling Phinuit. The result,\napparently, of all this was that Phinuit himself began in the first half\nof 1888 to spell his name with a single n. He spelt it thus on\nJune 5th, 1891, and when I then charged him with having dropped an\nn owing to a mistake on my part, and pointed out that he had changed\nhis name unwittingly, he denied it, saying that there were two n's, and\naffirming that probably he jumbled the two n's together quickly so\nthat it sounded like a single n. But there was no tone of confidence\niu the denial, and Phinuit's written signature, given on June 30th,\n1888, contains only one n.\nReturning to the statements made by Mr. J. M. Piper, it is curious\nthat Phinuit himself, in a sitting of May 26th, 1888, should have\nstated specifically that he had never controlled any other medium but\nMrs. Piper.\nQ. : \" Did you ever control any other medium?\" A. : \" No.\" Q. :\n\" Who is this Dr. Phinuit that controls the organism of Dr. J. Cocke ? ,r\nA.: \"Is that the same Dr. Phinuit that controls Dr.\u2014what is that\ndoctor's name in your country ? I do not know those fellows at all. Anothor\nK\n\f50 Mr. R. Hodgson. i\ngentleman tells me that he went to two mediums, and they both got a Dr.\nPhinuit ; one is Phinuit and the other is Phinnie.\" (This name may not be\nspelled correctly, but it ends with an e in distinction from the other.\u2014Stem.)\n\u00a7 8. Phinuit's Account of Himself.\n^In reply to my inquiries on different occasions, Phinuit stated that\nhis full name was Jean Phinuit Scliville. \" Phinuit is one of my names ;\nScliville is my other name ; Dr. Jean Phinuit Scliville ; they always\ncalled me Dr. Phinuit.\" He was unable to tell the year of his birth\nor the year of his death, but by putting together several of his state\nments, it would appear that he was born about 1790 and died about\n1860. He was born in Marseilles, went to school and studied medicine\nat a college in Paris called \" Merciana \" (?) College, where he took his.\ndegree when he was between twenty-five and twenty-eight years old\n\" Merciana. You know the name ' Meershaum ' ? That is the same\nname ; I cannot spell it ; sounds something like that.\" He also\nstudied medicine at \" Metz, in Germany.\" At the age of thirty-five\nhe married Marie Latimer, who had a sister named Josephine.\n\" Josephine was a sweetheart of mine first, but I went back on her and\nmarried Marie after all.\" Marie was thirty yeiys of age when he\nmarried her, and died when she was about fifty_!) He had no children.\nP. : \" Do you know where the Hospital of God is, Hospital de Dieu\n(H6tel Dieu) ? \" Sitter : \" It is in Paris.\" P. : \" Do you remember old\nDyruputia ? Dyruputia [Dupuytren ?] was the head of the hospital,\nand there is a street named for him.\" He went to London and from\nLondon to Belgium. \" I went to very different places after my health\nbroke down.\"\nSome discrepancies will be noticed between these statements\nand those given in Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 520, and I understand\nthat no trace of \"Jean Phinuit Scliville\" has been discovered at the\nmedical schools where Phinuit claims to have studied and practised, or\nalong other lines of inquiry suggested by the few fragments which he\n\u2022offers of his life history. Definite evidence establishing the existence\noi a Jean Phinuit Scliville under the circumstances described by\nPhinuit would not, of course, establish the identity of such once living\nperson with Mrs. Piper's Phinuit, but the complete lack of any such\n\u2022evidence appears to me to tell forcibly against the supposition that\nMrs. Piper's Phinuit is what for several years he has been asserting\nhimself to be.\n^ Concerning his inability to speak French, Phinuit's original explana\ntion to me was that he had lived in Metz the latter part of his life,\nand there were many English there, so that he was compelled to speak\nEnglish and had forgotten his French. I replied that this explanation\nwas very surprising, and that a much more plausible one would be that\n\fObservations of Certain PIienomena of Trance. 31\nhe was obliged to use the brain of the medium, and would therefore\nmanifest no more familiarity with French than she possessed This\u2014\ntrite enough\u2014suggestion appeared to Phinuit also more plausible, since\na few days later he offered it himself to another sitter as an explana\ntion of his inability to sustain a conversation in French\nDr. C. W. F. (see Report, No. 23) questioned Phinuit about the\nprominent medical men in Paris in Phinuit's time. The names of\nBouvier and Dupuytren were given. Dr. F. tells me that he (Dr. C. W. F.)\nknew nothing about Bouvier previously, but knew well about Dupuytren.\nThe doctors he had in mind at the time of his question \"were Velpeau,\nBouillaud, Nelaton, Andral, and many others, all prominent forty or\nfifty years ago with extended reputations.\"\nTaking the foregoing considerations together, it appears to me that\nthere is good reason for concluding that Phinuit is not a French doctor.\nHow far in the next place can Phinuit substantiate his claim to Iks\na doctor at all ? Where the sitter was aware of the nature of the\nailments described, we can suppose that Phinuit's communication may\nbe accounted for by telepathy. Mr. Piper informed me that Phinuit\nhad been frequently tested with herbs and had never made a mistake.\nI obtained three specimens of herbs from a friend of mine, a druggist,\ntaking care that their names and uses should be entirely unknown to\nme. Phinuit spent considerable time over these, but was absolutely\nwrong in everything that he said about them. Dr. F., who had three\nsittings with Mrs. Piper, and who has given me information concerning\nthem additional to that contained in his letter on p. 4, questions whether\nPhinuit's medical knowledge extends \" beyond what Mrs. Piper has\nread in ' Domestic medicine.' He gives always the common or vulgar\nnames of the medicines he describes, and never their botanical ones.\"\nDr. F. tells me that at his first sitting Phinuit\n\" dictated a prescription of plants to be steeped. They are in common use,\nsave one, for bladder affections, and Sir Henry Thompson, in his special\nwork, refers to this rather exceptional one as having done good service in\nsome bladder cases. I told Phinuit these might soothe the bladder some,\nbut could effect nothing for me. ' Have you ever prescribed triticum repens ? '\nI asked. I gave the French for it (chiendent). Now this is used every day\nin the week in the Paris hospitals as a diet drink, and when Phinuit said,\n' What is the English of that 1 ' I was astonished. He neither knew the\nbotanical nor the French name of this common dog-grass.\"\nThe chances for diagnosis of myself personally have been few. At\none of my earliest sittings Phinuit pronounced me to be perfectly\nsound, \" an old bach [bachelor], live to be a hundred \" (not, of course,\nmeant as a literal prophecy) ; then added that there was a slight in\nflammation of the nasal membranes, which was correct, though I know\nof no external sign that could have guided him to this. He recom\nmended a preparation of hamamelis. At another sitting I inquired\nk 2\n\fr,2 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nconcerning a slight pain which I no longer had, but had recently\nsuffered from, and Phinuit, after first objecting that he had told me\nbefore that I was \"all right,\" passed his hand over my left shoulder,\nand put a finger on the exact point under my left scapula where the\npain had been, saying that it was due to a cold draught from an open\nwindow, as might have been the case. At another time I inquired\nconcerning a pain which I had, and Phinuit almost instantaneously\nlocated it correctly, somewhat below the chest, pressing on the precise\nplace with his finger, and began to say that it was indigestion, but\ncorrected himself and explained that it was a strained muscle, due to\nsudden exercise. I had not consciously thought of this as the explana\ntion, which was probably correct, as on the second night previously,\njust before retiring, I had, for the first time for many weeks, gone\nthrough a series of exercises, bending forwards and backwards, &c,\nand I first experienced the pain on the day following. Phinuit's pre\nscription was to rub the part affected with cold water, applied by the\nhand.\nI have been informed privately of other diagnoses in addition to those\nmentioned in the reports, and agree with Professor Lodge (Proceedings,\nVol.VI., p. 449) that the \"medical statements\" form part of the evidence\nin favour of \" the existence of some abnormal means of acquiring infor\nmation \" ; but if we allow for telepathy, and admit that Phinuit may\nacquire supernormal perceptions of the various parts of the body, in\ncluding ttjfejnternal organs, I see no reason to suppose that he possesses\nany technical medical knowledge\u2014in other words, any more knowledge\nthan might be possessed by a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper. Nor\ndo I know of any statements made by Phinuit which, from the linguistic,\nor scientific, or philosophic point of view, can be regarded as beyond\nthe capacity of such a secondary personality. Incidents like that\nrelated by Mr. Rich (Report, No. 40)\u2014e'est une alliance\u2014even were\nthere many of them, as there are not, might be explained by the\nsupposition that Phinuit obtained these expressions from previous\nsitters, or by the fact that for several years Mrs. Piper's children had\na quasi-governess who lived in the house, and who could speak French\nfluently. We are then, I think, forced to the conclusion that there is\nfar from sufficient evidence to prove that Phinuit is either a Frenchman\nor a physician.\nFurther, he now believes\u2014or confesses\u2014that his name is not\nPhinuit at all. I have referred above to the changes\u2014apparently both\nof pronunciation and of spelling\u2014through which this name has passed,\nand have spoken of the matter on more than one occasion to Phinuit\nhimself, to whom I have frequently pointed out some of the difficulties\nin the way of supposing that he is what he purports to be, a \" spirit\nfrom the other world.\" I have also spoken of the matter to Mrs.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 53\nPiper on several occasions, and in the last conversation with her prior\nto November 13th, 1891, I pointed out to her how strong the presump\ntion was that Phinuit was an instance of auto-hypnotic suggestion,\nespecially since he first called himself Dr. Finney, a French physician,\nand she had previously witnessed Mr. Cocke's alleged \" control \" of the\nsame name (so pronounced). (On November 13th, 1891, Phinuit asked\nme to state candidly what I really thought about him, and the result\nwas a very plain conversation, in the course of which I described the\nview that he was the secondary personality of Mrs. Piper and that his\nname was suggested by that of the alleged \" control \" of Mr. Cocke ;\nand I mentioned the changes in the pronunciation and spelling of his\nname, and quoted the statements of Mr. J. M. Piper, that Phinuit was\nunquestionably the same person who had controlled Mr. Cocke, that\nPhinuit had described Mr. Cocke's sitters, &c. (p. 47). Phinuit then\nsaid that the frequent mention of Mr. Cocke's name had brought back\nto him circumstances which he had forgotten. He said that he recalled\nthat on the first occasion of his \"controlling\" Mrs. Piper, this Mr.\nCocke was present, that he (Phinuit) had made some diagnosis, and on\n\\mng questioned \"Who are you?\" had replied that his name was\nScliville, but that Mr. Cocke had said, \" No ; you're Dr. Finny.\"\n\"My name's Scliville.\" \"No ; you're Dr. Phinuit.\" \"All right ; call\nme Phinuit if you like.\" \"And I tell you, Hodgson, I really don't\nknow whether I'm Phinuit or not, but I think that's the way it came in.\nMy name is Jean, and Scliville, or something like that.\"V Phinuit\nexplained further that he did describe sitters with Mr. Cocke, but\nonly in the same way that he described what, e.g., Mrs. Holmes (Reports,\nNos. 45-49) was doing at a certain time. They sent him, he said, to\nfind out what Cocke was doing, but he never professed to \" control\nCocke's organism.\" He still insisted that his name was really Scliville,\nthat he was connected with Dupuytren and Latimer, and that some\ntrace of him should be discovered.\nIn reply to my inquiries, Mr. Wm. Piper states that \" from the\ncommencement and through the whole period of her [Mrs. Piper's]\ntrances, the control has given his name as Schliville, coupling it with\nJean and Phinuit. Phinuit being the easier for me to say, I have\nalways spoken to and of him as Phinuit.\" In conversation, Mr. Piper\nhas further informed me that he has no recollection of any such\ncircumstances as those described by Phinuit, and he believes that Mr.\nCocke was not present at all when Phinuit made his first appearance.\nI have also made inquiry of Mr. Cocke as to what happened when he\nwitnessed Mrs. Piper's Phinuit control, and he assured me that he had\nnever seen the Phinuit control at all, that he had witnessed \" Chlorine \"\nonly. To say the least, therefore, there is no evidence to corroborate\nPhinuit's statement about the origin of the name Phinuit.\n\f54 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nOn November 17th I questioned Phinuit still further, pressing him\nwith the apparent inconsistencies between statements of his, and the\ndifficulty of maintaining that he was Scliville when such name could\nnot be found in the hospitals where he said he had been. I asked\nhim if Mr. Cocke had not also suggested to him those details about\nhis life which he has frequently given, but he maintained resolutely\nthat this was not the case, that he was Scliville, that he was born in\nMetz, afterwards went to Marseilles, and studied under Dupuytren in\nParis, and that his name ought to appear in the register of physicians\nin Metz. On my reminding him that he had formerly said that he\nwas born at Marseilles, he queried whether he had not told me that it\nwas either Marseilles or Metz, and he added that he was sure\nnow that it was Metz. I find on examining my notes that\nPhinuit stated at my early sittings that he was born at Marseilles, but\non June 5th, 1891, that he was born either at Metz or Marseilles.\nAt the close of a sitting on November 20th, 1891, after Phinuit\nhad said \"Au revoir,\" and was in the act of \"departing,\" he murmured,\n\"Jean Phinuit\u2014no, not Phinuit\u2014Scliville.\" This was repeated, and then\na third time he began, \" Jean [here came a word which I could not\n* hear distinctly, but it was not \"Phinuit\"] Scliville. Ha! ha! I've\ngot my name at last.\" I referred to this incident at my next sitting,\nNovember 21st, and Phinuit said that he had recollected his middle\nname, which was Alaen. He reiterated that he was born in Metz, but\nthinks that he left Metz when he was very young. His full name was.\nDr. Jean Alaen Scliville. At more than one later sitting I have tried\nto shake Phinuit's belief or statement that he is \" Dr. Scliville \" the\n\" spirit \" of a once living human being, but without success.\nThese recent incidents, taking into account the statements of Mr.\nJ. M. Piper (p. 47) and Phinuit's distinct prevarication concerning\nthe spelling of his name (p. 49), strongly suggest that Phinuit found\nhimself absolutely \"cornered \" at last on the name Phinuit, and so sur\nrendered it with an ingenious explanation of its origin which he had\nworked up on the very basis of my objections. This hypothesis is\nstrengthened by the fact, as I think, that Phinuit's memory is marvel\nlously good, so good that it is scarcely credible that he could have\nforgotten the circumstances which he now alleges occurred on his first\nappearance.\n\u00a7 9. Relation of Phinuit to Mrs. Piper.\n( I have not been able to trace any continuity of memory between\nPhinuit and Mrs. Piper. I have already stated my belief that Mrs.\nPiper is entirely ignorant of what occurs during the trance, and Phinuit\nis, or pretends to be, equally unaware of the knowledge possessed by Mrs.\nPiper, and of the incidents which happen to her in her ordinary life.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 55\nOn one occasion, not long before a sitting (June 30th, 1888), Mrs.\nPiper was startled by a very near sudden clap of thunder, and Phinuit,\non being afterwards questioned, appeared to have no knowledge of the\ncircumstance, and apparently tried to guess at what had occurred.\nSimilarly on questioning Phinuit at one of my early sittings concerning\nthe life of Mrs. Piper, he professed ignorauce on the subject, but said\nthat he would \" find out things \" about her. At another sitting he\nsaid that he had been enjoined by Mrs. Piper's relatives not to talk\nabout her and her family (members of which at that time occasionally\nresorted to Phinuit for information and advice). Soon afterwards,\nhowever, Phinuit told me of incidents in connection with Mrs. Piper\nwhich I think that Mrs. Piper herself would never have mentioned to\nme, but it is uncertain whether he possessed this knowledge by virtue\nof Mrs. Piper's possessing it, or whether he acquired it by whatever\nsupernormal means he uses with ordinary sitters, or simply by conversa\ntion with Mrs. Piper's relatives. I have also met with several cases\nwhere Mrs. Piper knew not a little of the sitter's ordinary environment,\nnames of friends, &c., and yet this information was not given by\nPhinuit^ Further, indeed, I have known Phinuit under such circum\nstances to be confused and to make mistakes upon points well known to\nMrs. Piper. Still, all this \"ignorance\" may be \"the perfection of\nacting \" on the part of Phinuit, and possibly many of the details given\nby Phinuit in his attempts to describe my distant doings were specula\ntions resting upon Mrs. Piper's knowledge. (See Nos. 50 and 51.)\nRecently, in giving a diagnosis, he spoke of. \" bronical,\" but\nimmediately corrected it to \" bronchial,\" and a day or two later\nMrs. Piper, in her normal waking state, pronounced the word \"bronical,\"\nwithout correcting it.i But an incident of this kind hardly proves\nanything, since it might be alleged that Phinuit's mistake was literally\na lapsus linguae of Mrs. Piper's organism, and therefore explicable on\neither hypothesis\u2014of secondary personality, or of extraneous intel\nligence.\nIt seems hard to prove that Phinuit possesses all the know\nledge of Mrs. Piper, and still harder to prove that he possesses none\nof it, but I incline myself to think that if Phinuit is the secondary\npersonality of Mrs. Piper, the case does not belong to the class referred\nto by Mr. Leaf (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 560), where \" the abnormal\nstate is conscious of what goes on in the normal,\" but rather to a type\nwhere the change to the trance personality involves a partial oblitera-\ni Since the above was written I mentioned the circumstances to Mrs. Piper and\nexplained the word, and she was apparently unaware that it should bo pronounced\nbronchial. Later still, after I had been sent out of the room by Phinuit during a\nsitting, I lingered within earshot for the purpose of taking notes, and heard Phinuit\nsay Ironieal without making any correction.\n\f56 Mr. R. Hodgson.\ntion of the facts known to the normal waking self. (See \" A Case of\nDouble Consciousness,\" Proceedings, Part XIX.) Supposing that\nthere is such a partial obliteration, I have no suggestion to offer as to\nits extent, unless it be that Phinuit possesses the subconsciousness of\nMis. Piper, so that he knows all that Mrs. Piper has known and\nhas forgotten, but is ignorant of what she can still consciously remember.\nBut, again, I am unable to trace any connection between the apparent\ndeficiencies in Mrs. Piper's sense-organs during the trance state and\nany limitations of the knowledge exhibited by Phinuit.\n^1 made one attempt only, unsuccessful, to hypnotise Mrs. Piper.\nProfessor James, after several trials with her, succeeded in producing a\nsemi-hypnosis which he deseribes as \" very different from her medium-\ntrance.\" (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. G53.) I have frequently given\nPhinuit post-hypnotic suggestions concerning acts to be performed by\nMrs. Piper in the waking state, but entirely without result. The\nattempts of Professor James in the same direction wore also unavailing,\nand we have both tried to obtain, during Mrs. Piper's waking state,\nsome manifestation of Phinuit by gesture, speech, or automatic writing,\nin reply to our inquiries and commands, and during the trance state\nsome manifestation of Mrs. Piper ; but no response of any kind was\nelicited from the temporarily \" hidden \" personality. )\n\u00a710. Conclusion.\nThese considerations are all that I can offer at present towards the\nelucidation of the Phinuit personality, and they leave me still unsatisfied\nwith any simple interpretation. As experiments are still proceeding,\nI have not entered into such a detailed discussion as it seems to me\nwould be desirable were this report to be looked upon as final. So\nfar, however, I am convinced, as regaixls the bare information shown\nby Phinuit, that it cannot be accounted for entirely by thought-trans\nference from the sitters, and that at least some hypothesis which goes\nas far as thought-transference from the minds of distant living persons\nis demanded. Although Phinuit purports to obtain most of his infor\nmation from \" spirits,\" he has at times stated that some of his informa\ntion he obtained himself from the sitter's \"surroundings\" (as once in my\nown case), or from the sitter's \"astral light\" (Report, No. 23)\u2014a phrase\nwhich he doubtless acquired from a previous sitter, just as he learned\nthe word \" ethereal \" from myself. Possibly Phinuit may be assisted\nin some way by inanimate objects which have been much worn or\nhandled by specific persons, and, as I have said, they seem to add to\nthe chances of his success. There are some striking examples of\nthis already referred to in the reports, reminding one of the singular\nterm \" psychometry \" (originated, I believe, by J. R. Buchanan in\n1812), so common in Spiritualistic literature. Phinuit apparently\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 57\nclaims that such objects bring him into relation with the persons who\nhave handled them, whether such persons be living or dead. Now\nwhere the sitter knows the circumstances connected with the object,\nthe associations will probably form a specially vivid cluster of ex\nperiences in his mind, conscious or subconscious, owing to the very\npresence of the object within the field of his perception, and this may\nhelp Phinuit to discover and disentangle these associations by direct\nthought-transference. Where, on the other hand, the sitter is ignorant\nof the circumstances connected with the object, it may, at any rate,\nform a sort of point de repere enabling Phinuit to get telepathically,\nthrough the mind of the sitter, at the mind of the distant living\nperson from whom the object was obtained and who knows of its\nassociations.\nAnd here we touch what is perhaps the most important question\nconcerned in the phenomena connected with Mrs. Piper's trance-state.\n\u00a3 Putting aside all the facts which can be explained by direct thought-\ntransference from the sitter, and considering simply the information\ngiven which was not known to the sitter and which purports to come\nfrom \" deceased \" persons, but which was known to, and afterwards\nverified by, distant living persons,\u2014is there sufficient ground for\nconcluding that Phinuit is in direct communication with \" deceased \"\npersons, and that he is a \" deceased \" person himself as he alleges 1 I\nthink that the evidence here presented, together with that previously\npublished, is very far from sufficient to establish any such conclusion,\nand indeed the failures in answering test-questions and the apparent\nignorance displayed in other ways by the alleged \" communicators,''\nsuch as I have instanced^ m ooimection with Mrs. Blodgett's experi-\nments (pp. 10-16), the \" E.\" control (p. 44), and the additional cases\nfurnished me by Miss W. (pp^4*M4-),^constitute almost insuperable\nobjections to the supposition that the \"deceased\" persons concerned\nwere in direct communication with Phinuit, at least in anything like\nthe fulness, so to speak, of their personality.\" Whether Phinuit may\nnot possibly get into some indirect communication\u2014actual, though\npartial and fragmentary\u2014with \" deceased \" persons, is a much more\ndifficult question to determine, and I venture to think that this\nhypothesis is one that should be continually borne in mind.\n(The hypothesis which for a long time seemed to me the most\nsatisfactory is that of an auto-hypnotic trance in which a secondary\npersonality of Mrs. Piper either erroneously believes itself to be, or\nconsciously and falsely pretends to be, the \"spirit\" of a deceased\nhuman being, Phinuit or Scliville, and further fictitiously represents\nvarious other personalities according to the latent ideas of some of\nthe sitters. Several facts which 1 have mentioned\u2014especially con\ncerning the name \" Dr. Fin-nc \" as that of Mr. Cocke's \" control,\"\n\u25a0\n\f58 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nwitnessed by Mrs. Piper before her trances began, the adoption of\nthis name by Mrs. Piper's trance-personality, its corruption into\nPhinnuit, later into Phinuit, and the subsequent apparent prevarica\ntion to explain these facts away\u2014seem to point strongly towards this\nview. My confidence, however, in this explanation has been consider\nably shaken by further familiarity with the Phinuit personality and\nother allied \"manifestations\" of Mrs. Piper's trance-state, and I have\nno certain conviction that any single theory which has been put\nforward is really the correct one. I do not know of any precise\nparallel to the phenomena which we are here discussing, among any\nof the recorded types of hypnotic trance where the action of other\nthan embodied human intelligence is a plainly superfluous hypothesis.\nIt is much to be desired that any of our members who may happen\nto have ample opportunity for experiment with hypnotic subjects,\nshould, by endeavouring to reproduce cases akin to Mrs. Piper's, see\nwhat can be done in the way of demonstrating whether these phe\nnomena can be fully accounted for without supposing the action of\nsuch extraneous intelligence. \\\nAddendum. May, 1892.\nThe foregoing report is based upon sittings not later than 1891.\n'Mrs. Piper has given some sittings very recently which materially\nstrengthen the evidence for the existence of some faculty that goes\nbeyond thought-transference from the sitters, and which certainly\nprinid facie appear to render some form of the \"spiritistic\" hypothesis\nmore plausible. I hope to discuss these among other results in a later\narticle.\n\fObsei'vations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 59'\nAPPENDIX.\nDETAILED REPORTS OF SITTINGS.\nThe following accounts of sittings comprise nearly all the records\nwhich I have received (before November, 1891). I possess several\nrecords which I have no permission to use, and several others which,\ncither from the fragmentariness of the account or the insufficiency of\nthe explanations of the statements made at the sitting, I regard as of no\nvalue ; but all of these that I omit, I believe, are favourable to the view\nthat Mrs. Piper exhibits some supernormal faculty. So far as I am aware,\nI have not omitted any other records in my possession\u2014except, of\ncourse, the two series of stenographic reports dealt with by the\nCommittee of the former American Society for Psychical Research1\nand the recent series concerning articles sent by Mr. \" V.\" (See p. 132.)\nIt is hardly needful to point out that the records differ widely in\nevidential value. Some of them are made from very full notes taken\nduring the sittings, others from memory long afterwards, but I think\nthat all of them will prove of some service in our endeavour to get at\nthe real meaning of the Phinuit personality, of which it is desirable to\nhave as complete a history as possible.\nThe series of reports 1\u201417 are of sittings which came under my\nown immediate arrangement or were noted by me, and may be regarded\nas a representative (not selected) group.\nReports 18\u201423 were forwarded to me by Professor James, and\nreports 24\u201428 by the Rev. M. J. Savage ; reports 36 and 38 I received\nowing to my having made the appointment for the sittings. In\nconnection with the work of the Society I ascertained the names of\nmany persons who had had sittings with Mrs. Piper, and endeavoured\nto obtain accounts from them, but with little success. Reports 29, 30,\n33, 34, 37, 39, and 40 represent the result. Mrs. Piper also furnished\nme, at my request, with some names of persons who had had sittings\nwith her, and hence reports 31, 32, and 35. Report 41 is of specific\nexperiments made by myself at different times with locks of hair.\nReports 42\u201453 form a representative group of sittings given by\nMrs. Piper since her return to America.\nI have also the stenographic reports of my attempts in 1888 (May\n26th, June 2nd, 9th, 16th, and 30th) to obtain better explanations from\nPhinuit himself of his own \" control,\" &c. (see pp. 2, 3). I have used\nthese largely and quoted from them in the previous pages. It seems\nunnecessary to print further extracts at present.\n' See my reference to this on p. 2, and the remark of Professor James in S.P.R.\nProceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 652-3. The stenographic reports were for the private use\nof the Committee.\n\f-GO Mr. R. Hodgson,\n1. B. Hoihjson. First Sittin'j. May 4th, 1887. 10.30 a.m.\n[From notes made on return to my rooms immediately after the sitting.]\nPhinuit began, after the usual introduction, by describing members of my\nfamily.\n\"Mother living, father dead, little brother dead.\" [True.] Father and\nmother described correctly, though not with much detail. In connection\nwith the enumeration of the members of our family, Phinuit tried to get a\nname beginning with \"R,\" but failed. [A little sister of mine, named\nRebecca, died when I was very young, I think less than eighteen months\nold.]\n\" Four of you living besides mother. \" [True.]\nPhinuit mentioned the name \"Fred.\" I said that it might be my cousin.\n\"He says you went to school together. He goes on jumping-frogs, and\nlaughs. He says he used to get the better of you. He had convulsive\nmovements before his death, struggles. He went off in a sort of spasm.\nYou were not there. \" [My cousin Fred far excelled any other person that\nI have seen in the games of leap-frog, fly the garter, &c. He took very\nlong flying jumps, and whenever he played, the game was lined by crowds of\nschool-mates to watch him. He injured his spine in a gymnasium in\nMelbourne, Australia, in 1871, and was carried to the hospital, where he\nlingered for a fortnight, with occasional spasmodic convulsions, in one of\nwhich he died.]\nPhinuit described a lady, in general terms, dark hair, dark eyes, slim\nfigure, ifec, and said that she was much closer to me than any other person :\nthat she \"died slowly. Too bad you weren't with her. You were at a\ndistance. It was a great pain to both of you that you weren't there. She\nwould have sent you a message, if she had known she was going. She had\ntwo rings ; one was buried with her body ; the other ought to have gone to\nyou. The second part of her first name is\u2014 sie. \" [True, with the exception\nof the statement about the rings, which may or may not be true. I have\nbeen unable to obtain any information about them. No ring ever passed be\ntween the lady and myself. She died in Australia in 1879. There were no\nrelations between her family and ours after 1875. After trying in vain to\n\"hear distinctly \" the first part of the name, Phinuit gave up the attempt,\nand asked mo what the first name was. I told him. I shall refer to it\nafterwards as \"Q.\"]\nIn reply to Phinuit's question as to the name of my living brother, I said\n\"Tom.\" \" There are two Toms,\" said Phinuit, \" both brothers ; the spirit\nbrother is Tom as well.\" [True.]\nJohn was given as the name of my mother's father. [Since ascertained\nto be not true.]\nName3 of William and R ibert -said to be not living\u2014were mentioned ;\nand also Alfred, Alice, Arthur, Carrie, Charlie, Ellen, James, Lizzie, and\nMarie, but nothing specific was stated in connection with them.\nDuring the sitting I could not recall anyone named Marie, one of the\nnames which Phinuit said he heard. When \"Charlie\" was mentioned I\nthought of a living friend of mine and said so. No further details were\ngiven. As I walked down the street after the sitting was over, it flashed\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 61\nupon me that Charlie was the name of a friend, an Oxford University man,\nwho had died in India (I think in 1885), that he was engaged to a young\nlady whose first name was Marie, whom I knew exceedingly well and was\naccustomed to hear called Marie, and that these names had been connected\nin some way by Phinuit. This incident is doubly suggestive, as regards the\nextreme importance of stenographic reports in investigations of this kind.\nThe relation between Marie and Charlie might not have been directly\nsuggested by Phinuit at all, out might have been the result of my own\nmental action afterwards. On the other hand, during the sitting, I denied\never having known a Marie, and did not think of the Charlie who had paid a\nspecial visit to my rooms in Cambridge, and whom I had accompanied to>\nthe station on his departure. As I have learnt by later experience, Phinuit\nfrequently mentions a name, having some specific facts to give in connection\nwith it if the sitter recognises the person Phinuit has in mind. Thus, Fred\nis mentioned, and I say that it might be my cousin, and Phinuit details\nhighly characteristic marks of identity. Charlie is mentioned, and, possibly,\nI think of the wrong Charlie, and get nothing further.\nMy younger sister was rightly spoken of by Phinuit as married, and he\nused a phrase, the exact words of which I could not recall, implying clearly\nthat she had three children. This was true, but I gave no sign of approval,\nwhereas I had been assenting to at least the important statements previously\nmade by Phinuit. Following my silence, Phinuit repeated the statement,\nand I again let it pass without agreeing ; whereupon he attempted to turn\nthe phrase and have another \"shot.\" \"What I mean is that there are\nthree in the family, don't you see ? There's herself, and her husband, and\none child. That makes three. \" I then told him that he had been right at\nfirst. \" Why didn't you say so, then ? And there's another one coming very\nsoon, and it's a boy.\" [True. My sister, who lives in Australia, had a\nfourth child, a boy, before the end of May.]\n2. R. Hodgson. Secmul Sitting. November 18th, 1887. 12\u20141 p.m.\n[From notes made during the sitting.]\nNovember 18th, 1887.\nVarious persons mentioned as in previous sitting. Fred\u2014with\ndescription of death \u2014Harry, &c. [Harry, Fred's brother, still living in\nAustralia.] Other incidents repeated. The following is chiefly new\nmatter.\nPhinuit mentioned \" Q.\" and apparently said that she had a sister and a\nbrother. [Not true, as I believe ; I think that there was only one other\nchild in the family, still-born ; I do not know the sex.]\nPhinuit said that \"Q.\" would soon be able to \" control \";\u2014referred to\na black lace collar, with a pin with a head, also a ring with a stone, and\nsaid that \"Q.\" wanted the pin and the ring to be given to me. [I\nrecollect the collar distinctly, and the pin vaguely, but cannot recall any\nspecific incidents attaching to them. I do not recall a \"ring with a stone.\"}\nSchool-mate, with lot of freckles, little fellow, red hair, name that\nsounded something like Wingford\u2014he lived with his grandmother. [This\nrecalled a school-mate of mine\u2014Australia, about 1868. One day I took him\n\f62 Mr. R. Hodgson.\non a bathing excursion, and he was very anxious to get home by ;i certain\ntime, becauso his grandmother had told him to do so, and I learnt for the\nfirst time that his mother was dead. I felt a special tenderness for the lxiy\nafter this, but do not know what became of him. His name was not\nWingford, but I struggled vainly at the sitting to recall it. Some hours later\nit came\u2014Grimwood.]\nReferred to another school-mate mentioned by \" Wingford \"\u2014this other\nwas lame\u2014the name sounded like Brookford. [Grimwood used to sit on the\nfront row, and on the same row, and I think next to Grimwood, sat a boy\nwho was lame. His name was not Brookford, but I think was something\nlike Brooks.]\nReferred to Charles Knight, and said his uncle was present. [I think that\nCharles Knight sat immediately behind me in the same class, but I also knew\na Charlie Knight at a Sunday-school, and cannot distinguish them clearly.]\nEdward\u2014a Dr.\u2014\"Tell him he uses his brain too much.\" He hasn't\nbeen very well. [I was associated in S. P. R. matters with a Dr. Edward\n, whose other work was slightly straining him at the time, but hardly\n\u00abo as to justify Phinuit's statement.]\nWeldon. Wilton: \"He's all right.\" [l knew both a Weldon and a\nWilton intimately, the former in England, the latter in Australia, but nothing\nspecific was mentioned concerning either of them.]\n[I here made inquiry concerning an incident which occurred on\nNowmbcr 9th, 1887. On the afternoon of that day a lady called upon me,\nwith whom I had corresponded concerning her \" mediumistic \" (private)\nexperiences. During the interview she obtained an \"impression\" with\nreference to myself, that she said came from a person who was slow at\nexpressing his thoughts, and who had never \" communicated \" before. She\nthought the communication came from a man ; but the only word she could\nget was Lakes. I described the occurrence, and asked Phinuit if he could\nexplain it.] He said at once, \" Henry Lakes,\" connected with Emily and\nSarah. Both \" passed \" [dead], he also ; lived at house at corner of a Park-\nstreet in England, an old house. [These remarks recalled to me an elderly\nman, who lived in a house at, or close to, the corner of Park-street and the\npassage from St. John-street into Park-street. I think that two young ladies\nlived in the same house, which I passed several times a day on my way to\nand from my lodgings in Park-street. I have no remembrance of ever\nknowing the names of any of them. Mr. Myers inquired, and cannot\nascertain that anyone of the name of Lakes lived there.]\nJ. gave a description of Mr. J. [Full name given.] Said J. was in\nspirit land some time, couldn't tell exactly how long, difficulty in estimating\ntime. George J. mathematics, some paper in a book in a desk. Tell Al.\nsomething \u2014to get it ; will be useful. [There was an obscurity about this\nmessage, but my impression was that Phinuit wished to convey to me that\nMr. J . was dead. The family was identified clearly enough. The eldest\nson George had specialised in mathematics, and one of the daughters is\nnamed Alice. I had not heard anything about the J. 's since leaving England\nin April, 1887. Two years after the sitting I learnt that Mrs. J., who\nwas a special friend of mine, died on November 10th, 1887. Mr. J. is\nstill living.]\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. C3\nReferred to beautiful teeth of \"Q.\" Said that she wanted mo to keep\nthe book of poems always with me, the book which I had sent her, and had\nreceived back. I should recollect the writing in front of it, which I had\nwritten myself. [\" Q.'s\" teeth were not beautiful. On the contrary, a year\nor two before her death, the state of her teeth compelled the drawing of a\nlarge number of them. Many were taken out at one time, and the opera\ntion entailed upon her a severe nervous exhaustion, from which, however,\nshe was eventually supposed to have recovered. I had lent \" Q.\" Tlw Princess\n(Tennyson), which had been returned. It is the only book in my possession,\nand I think the only book of any kind, which I had ever lent her. This\nbook is now with most of my other books in England. It was my custom at\nthat time to write favourite lines on the fly-leaves of special books. I do\nnot recall with certainty what lines, if any, I had written in this book.]\nMarie. Aunt of Marie, in spirit world, appeared, but with veil before,\ncouldn't impress or be seen distinctly, hair parted in middle, curled back\n\u2022over ears, peculiar crook in nose. [See note concerning name Marie in first\nsitting. I know nothing of her aunt.]\n******\n[Phinuit said he could describe my rooms by \"leaving the medium\"\nfor five minutes, would try when I had the earliest sitting some morning,\nwhen not confused by atmospheres of different spirits and different persons.]\n3. R. Hodgson. Third Sitting. November 29th, 1887. 9.30 a.m.\n[The only special note which I can find concerning this sitting is the\nfollowing, which I had written as an appendix to my account of the second\nsitting.]\nTried to describe the room at next sitting, which was poor, chiefly\nrepetition ; but did not \" leave the medium.\" The description was, on the\nwhole, a failure, and failed as description of the rooms at the time.\n4. R. Hodgson. Fourth Sitting. December 4th, 1887.\n[From notess made during the sitting.]\nJust returned from sitting with Mrs. Viper. At my previous sitting I\nhad arranged with \"Dr. Phinuit\" that he should make inquiries of my\n(dead) friends, and communicate the results to me at the next subsequent\nsitting. I had arranged for sitting on Wednesday, November 30th, 1887,\n9.30 a.m., the first which Mrs. P. should give that morning, but Mrs. P.\nbegged to be allowed to give a sitting at 8.30 a.m. to a lady who was going\nto New York, to which I assented. On Wednesday morning Mrs. P. told\nme that she had considerable difficulty in going into trance for her previous\nvisitor. After waiting for about half an hour with me, Mrs. Piper gave up\nthe sitting, as she could not go into trance. The sitting of this morning\nwas substituted for Wednesday's.\nUsual preliminaries, and then \"Dr. Phinuit\" started away at once without\nany remark at all by me. to reproduce what he recollected of his conversa\ntions. I changed my seat to the floor partly behind Mrs. Piper, where I\ncould get enough light to make notes.\n\f64 Mr. R. Hodgson.\n1. Information purporting to have been received from \" Q. \" The chief\nnew matter was :\n(a) That I had given her a book, \"Dr. Phinuit \" thinks, of poems, and\nI had written her name in it, in connection with her birthday.\n[Correct.]\n(6) [Correct. This includes a reference to circumstance*\nunder which I had a very special conversation with \"Q.\" I\nthink it impossible that \"Q.\" could have spoken of this to any\nother person. It occurred in Australia in 1875.]\n(c) That she \"left the body\" in England, and that I was across the\ncountry. [This is incorrect. \"Q.\"died in Australia. I was in\nEngland.]\n2. Information purporting to have been received from my cousin Fred.\nThe chief new matter was :\n(a) That I was not there when ho swung on the trapeze and fell and\ninjured his spine, finally dying in a convulsion. [At my first sitting\nthe accident was not described, only the death, at which I was\nrightly said not to have been present. At this sitting the accident was\ndescribed, at which also I was rightly said not to have been present.]\n(b) That he wanted to remind me of Harris at school, who was a very\nable man, &c. [I believe it was also stated that Fred and myself\ntalked together about Harris, and that Harris had a high opinion of\nFred's ability. This was all true. Harris was a schoolmaster who\ntaught Fred and myself (Melbourne, Australia), about 1868 or\n1869. I saw Harris, I think, a short time after my cousin's death\n(in 1871), and ho expressed his regrets, &c. I do not recall having\nseen or heard anything of Harris since. ]\n(c) That his father was my mother's brother. [True.]\nAll the preceding matter came steadily out, after which \"Br. Phinuit\"\nappeared to have exhausted his recollections, and to be attempting to get\nfurther information there and then. He referred to a church to which both\n\" Q.\" and myself used to go, and then asked if it was in \"Hanover Square.\"\nI replied, No, whereupon he told me not to note anything until he got it\n' ' clearer. \"\n\"Dr. Phinuit\" then charged me with weighing too much who he was,\nwhere he came from, &c, while he was trying to give me information, and\nsaid that this harassed and confused him. I should, he said, be as\n\"negative\" as possible during the sitting. [The charge was justified, as I had\nactually drifted into the consideration of what Phinuit was, &c.]\nHe referred to a \"Joe,\" but told me nothing special about him.\n[Although I had a special friend in Australia whom I used to call Joe.]\nHe said he heard \"something about being in Yorkshire.\" Was the\nlady [i.e., \" Q. \"] in Yorkshiro ? (No.) [I have spent holidays in Yorkshire,\nand my father was a Yorkshireman.]\n******\n\" Dr. Phinuit \" then said there was something in my pocket connected\nwith a loss, and asked me to empty the objects from my pocket into her\nand. I asked which pocket? \"The right pants pocket.\" I gave\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 65\nher each article in turn, and she rejected all, and then said it was\nin my other pocket. She rejected purse and lens from this pocket and\ngrabbed at the keys. She (\" Dr. Phinuit \") said I had lost some of my keys\nnear some mountains. There was a big mountain near ; the keys were lying\nnear a walk, by some leaves. There was a cottage near. The keys were\nstill there. They were on a ring, something different from the holder of the\nkeys in her hand. What held the lost keys was round. [I had lost my keys\nin the Adirondack Mountains, and hunted vainly for them. They were\nfound after my departure from camp on a spot answering to \"Phinuit's\"\ndescription. Before their recovery, however, I had been compelled to\nobtain duplicates of most of the keys, and had fastened these on a heart-\nshaped holder. The old keys were fastened on a common key-rwiy. All that\n\" Phinuit \" said was known to me. \" Phinuit \" was right in all except in the\nstatement that the lost keys were still in the mountains. At the time of the\nsitting they were locked up in my desk. I believe that some of the old\nkeys were on the new bunch, though I cannot be certain of this, not having\nnoted this point at the time.]\nI asked \"Dr. Phinuit\" to get me information, before my next sitting,\nconcerning: 1. Full name of lady\u2014\"Q.\" 2. Detailed description of face.\n3. Place of dying. 4. The church to which \"Dr. Phinuit\" referred.\n5. Details of the finding of my keys, with all the persons concerned.\n*****\n6. R. Hodgson, Fifth Sitting. December 23rd, 1887.\n[From notes made during the sitting.]\nFred says you came from Australia. [True.] Lady, \"Q.,\"says so too,\nsays she was there and knew you there, and used to be a great friend of your\nsister. [True.] You heard about her death by letter from your sister. [True.]\n[Little confusion about letters. This note was made during the sitting.]\nYou went into Germany. Fred went with you in spirit. You went to\nGermany after father went into spirit. (No.) Got awfully provoked with a\nlady in Germany. You said she was deceitful, called her a storyteller. [True.\nWhile in Germany, in 1882, I charged a lady with falsehood under somewhat\npeculiar circumstances. My father died in 1885.]\nHarris. [See previous sitting.]\nW'ordsworth and St. John's. Fred mentions it, i. e. , Fred mentions that\none of my chief reasons for choosing St. John's College was the fact that\nWordsworth was a Johnian. [True, though Fred died in 1871, and it was\nyears afterwards when I first contemplated going to Cambridge.]\nMary Chadwick. [No significance. I know a family named Chadwick, but.\nnot any Mary Chadwick.]\nEllis? Bates? Connected or associated with \"Q.\" [I know nothing\nabout \"Q. 's \" companions between 1875 and 1879.] Isn't her name Eller-\nton ? (No.) Doesn't it end with \" on \" ? (You must tell me.) Her hair is.\nbrown, blue eyes, she's rather small, slim, hair darker than yours, prominent\nnose, considerable colour in cheeks, rather pretty teeth. She says she died\nin England. (Wrong. Your description of \" Q.\" all wrong.) [Note made\nduring sitting. She went over facts correctly.] [The preceding note apparently\nmeans that the general description and place of death of \"Q.,\" Australia,\nwere correctly given.]\nf\n\fGG Mr. R. Hodgson.\nWe then had a long talk about the \" Phinuit's \" powers, &o., and he said\nthat I had confused him by not letting him go his own way, that when he\nwas trying to get through his memories of what Fred had told him I inter\nrupted him, &c., and that he got mixed up about what \" Q. \" told him, that\nI had asked him too many things at once, &c. ; said he would ascertain\nfull name of \"Q.\" and her exact description, and that would be enough.\n[The above sitting began by Phinuit's saying that he had had long talks\nwith Fred, and that he now knew all about me. that Fred in spirit had\naccompanied me wherever I went, &c. I interrupted Phinuit by demanding\nreplies to my specific questions asked at previous sittings.]\n0. K. Hudgsuu. Sixth Sitting. January 20M, 1888.\n[From notes taken during sitting, with several minor points recollected after\nwards during the same day.]\nHad a sitting this morning with Mrs. Piper.\nPhinuit referred to \"Q.,\" said she spoke of a Loo\u2014something. [Louie\nwas the name of a cousin of \"Q.,\" very intimate with \"Q.\" and myself in\nchildhood.] Said her full name was \"Q.'' A . Is that right? (No.)\nWell, she says \"Q.\" A . [A is the surname of other cousins of\n\" Q.,\" who frequently stayed at her house, and were well known to me.]\nPhinuit then proceeded to give a general description of \"Q.,\" right so\nfar as it went, and described the eyes as \"dark.\" She then began to rub\nthe right eye on the under side, saying, \"There's a spot here. This eye\n(left) is brown, the other eye has a spot in it of a light colour, in the iris.\nThis spot is straggly, of a bluish cast. It is a birth-mark. It looks as if it\nhad been thrown on. [Being asked to describe its shape.] It is like this,\nrunning in towards the pupil.\" [Presenting the back of one hand towards\nme, with fingers pointing downwards, and tracing on the little finger-nail,\nwith the forefinger of the other hand, an acute-angled triangle with apex\nupward\u2014thus :\u2014\nI asked her to draw it, the result bsing the figure, a reproduction of which\nis attempted below :\u2014 . t\nThis was drawn with the block-book held away from Mrs. P., where she\ncould not see what she was drawing, her eyes being 1 ehind and cIosi to the\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 67\nblock-book.] \"This (U) is the top part of the iris. This (L) is the bottom.\nThis (P) is the pupil. The light part is here\" [making the other lines in the\nligure].\n[\" Q.\" had a splash of what I should call grey (rlther than blue) in the\nright eye, occupying the position and having very nearly the shape assigned\nby Phinuit. I should have drawn it as I remember it, thus :\u2014\n\u00a9.\nIt was very peculiar ; a little jagged in the edges, and sharply and dis\ntinctly marked off from the rest of the brown iris. I asked Phinuit how he\nobtained the information about the eyes. He said that \" Q. \" was standing\nclose to him and showing him her right eye so that he could see it clearly,\nand siying that that was what I wanted. This peculiarity in the eye was\nwhat I had in mind when I asked Phinuit for a detailed description of\n\" Q.'s \" face.]\n*****\n7. Mrs. Howard Okie. February, 1888.\n[Appointments made by R. H. No name given.]\nMrs. Okie had two sittings with Mrs. Piper, at both of which I was\npresent. I took notes during the first sitting on February 1st, 1888,\nbut I cannot find any notes of the second sitting, on February 8th,\n1888, except a brief entry in my diary. At this second sitting Mrs.\nOkie's father was again described, and said to be her father. The name was\nalso given, being spelt out Vaughn, the real name being Vaughan. There\nwas also what apparently purported to be the direct \"control\" by Mr.\nVaughan, addressing Mrs. Okie as his \" daughter Lily,\" according to Mr.\nVaughan's custom when alive. \"Lily, I passed away in my chair.\" It was\nalso stated that he was reading Mill's Logic when he died. Mr. Vaughan\ndied in Providence, R.I. He was found dead in his chair before the fire,\nwith a book in his hand, but Mrs. Okie has been unable to ascertain the name\nuf the book. Mr. Vaughan was much interested in philosophical questions,\nand talked with me about Mill, Hamilton, Spencer, &c. In this second\nsitting the name Henry was also given, and Phinuit stated that Henry was\nmanaging the money matters all right. Henry is the name of Mrs. Okie's\nbrother, but the statement about him made by Phinuit had no special\nsignificance.\nMrs. Okie writes : \" My first sitting with Mrs. Piper was not at all\nsatisfactory to me. There seemed to me to be a great deal of guessing and\n' hedging. ' As we were leaving the house we met friends, two of whom\nhad known mo since I was a young girl. Owing to this occurrence I could\nnot help feeling a bit suspicious on my next visit when the medium was able\nto give the full names of many of my relatives with perfect accuracy and\nconfidence ; but nothing was given to me which those friends did not know.\"\nf 2\n\fOS Mr. R. Hodgson.\n8. Saml. A. Hopkins, M.D. Spriwj of 1888.\n[Appointment made by R. H. No name given.]\n235, Marlborough-street, June 27th, 1890.\nMy Dear Hodgson, \u2014I have no notes of my sitting with Mm. Piper, nor\nwas there anything remarkable to record, save, possibly, one incident, which\nis perfectly clear in my mind. After the usual rubbish of mentioning a lot\nof names\u2014John, Will, Fanny, etc, she seemed to stick at Lily, and insisted\nthat I knew Lily, and asked me who the doctor was who was near Lily, and\ninsisted that I knew him. [Mrs. Okie's husband is a doctor.\u2014R. H.] Then\nshe said, \" There is someone here who has been in spirit land only a short\ntime, who wants to send a message to Lily. V\u2014A\u2014U\u2014G\u2014H\u2014N\u2014\nVaughn wants to send a message to Lily. He wants you to give her his\nkind regards. Don't forget it, now. Vaughn has only been here a little\nwhile, and is a little l tme.\" Mrs. Okie's father had been dead only a short\ntime, and I afterwards found was a little lame, though I had never discovered\nit. The other statements of Mrs. Piper's were either wrong or entirely\nnegative. ... S. A. Hopkins.\n9. T. P. Derham. May 2Lsf-22n\/\/, 1888.\n[Appointments made by R. H. No name given.]\nNotes were made by me during the sitting. Mr. Derham is my brother-\nin-law, having married my younger sister. He resides in Melbourne,\nAustralia. The sitting was a successful one, though Phinuit made a few\nmistakes. Several circumstances mentioned were unknown to me, among\nthem the following. Early in the first sitting, Phinuit said: \"Something\nlost. Pin. Watch chain. What the devil is that thing you've lost ? \" And\nlater on in the same sitting returned to it : \" You've lost something. It's a\nfunny round thing ; a ring thing, don't you know ? Black fellow got it.\nYou'll never see it again. You lost it escapading.\" Mr. Derham says:\u2014\"I\nwas the last to leave the railway carriage at Niagara, and left my field-glass\nsuspended by its strap to a bar below the roof. I have no doubt the coloured\nconductor secreted it. I had telegrams sent to every station, but never re\ncovered the glass.\"\nMr. Derham's comments on the sittings sufficiently explain their char\nacter:\u2014\" August I8th, 1890. \u2014I have made no study of the subject, but am\ninclined to think that the condition into which Mrs. Piper seemed to pass\nwas real and not assumed. For one thing, I do not think a nervous woman\ncould go through the teeth-grinding she did without shuddering. The only\nincident that would incline me to the contrary view is that when she said I\nhad lost something she put her hand to my watch-chain, which had a short\npendant chain, but nothing at the end of the pendant. She seemed to infer\nthat what was lost had been attached to the pendant ; though she did not\nsay so.\n\" I may say that scarcely anything she said was in my mind the moment\nbefore she spoke, though everything of which I now have any knowledge,\nexcept prophecies, was stored somewhere in my mind.\n\" I was much impressed with her groping after ' Eggleston,' my partner's\nname. I feel sure that if it had been a little less difficult she would have\nfound the name. [The nearest approach was ' Everson. ']\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 69\n\"The history of my family, living and dead, was given straight out\u2014\nwithout any guessing and without the slightest assistance from either Dr.\nHodgson or myself. I think I did'not speak at all, and Dr. Hodgson only\nspoke to bring her to the point.\n\" If I remember rightly, Mrs. Piper represents herself as taken possession\nof by the spirit of a deceased doctor whose name I forget. (Is it Phinuit ?)\nIn fact, the first words she uttered after ' going off ' were, ' Comment vous\nportez vous ? ' and she continued, with more or less constancy, to speak in\nbroken English. I do not for a moment believe this pretence, and am,\ntherefore, inclined to say that Mrs. Piper introduces mine humbug into her\nperformances, though, as I do not understand the subject, she may be\nherself deceived. The explanation that would harmonise with my impression\nat the interviews is, that she had the power of reading, not my thoughts at\nthe moment, but facts stored away in the recesses of my memory.\n\" I do not knowthat I can usefully add anything, except that I am naturally\nsceptical, and, by training, incredulous.\"\n10. Mrs. Bludyett. Miiy 30th, 1888. 9.30 a.m.\nMrs. Blodgett was anxious to obtain a special test, if possible, con\ncerning her deceased sister. She gives an account of this in the\nfollowing statement : \u2014\nMiss Hannah Wild died July 28th, 1886. She was a strong Baptist,\u2014\nnever went to any other church. About one year before her death a paper\nin Boston published what claimed to be a message from our dead mother.\nMy sister was very much wrought up about it.\nI had been very much interested in the subject for about two years,\nbut as far as I had gone had never got anything true, only what could\nhave baen mind-reading. So I told sister all my experience and asked her\nto write me a private letter, and if ever she came back she was to tell me\nwhat was in it. If she could not tell I was not to believe it was her spirit.\nWe talked it over every day for weeks, in fact every time she had a bad\nspell I would say, \" Sister, you have not written me the letter.\" One day,\nabout a week before she died, she said, \" Bring me pen and paper. If spirit\nreturn is true, the world should know. I will write the letter. It will also\nprove that the dead do not lie asleep in their graves waiting for a resurrec\ntion, like the Second Adventists believe.\"\nShe wrote the letter,\u2014sealed it (no mortal hands were to touch it), and\nput it into a tin box with bank book, where it was to remain until I got a\ncopy of it that sounded like her. When she handed me the box she said,\n\" If I can come back, it will be like ringing the City Hall bell.\" She spoke\nabout the letter often after. I told her I would wait for an answer if I had\nto get an English medium to answer.\nMy hands have never touched that letter. It is in my husband's safe.\nWhen I sent to Professor James, I took it out with scissors.\u2014Yours,\nMrs. Bessie Blodgett, sister of Miss Hannah Wild.\nHolyoke, July, 1890.\nP.S.\u2014The letter is in my husband's safe, where it has been kept ever\nsince we were married.\n\f70 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nMrs. Bloclgett, having seen n notice of the American S. P. R. in it\npaper in the latter part of 1886, in which the name of Professor\nJames was mentioned, wrote to him, telling him the circumstances of\nthe letter written by her sister. As a result of the correspondence.\nProfessor James endeavoured to obtain some information from\nPhinuit. A brief account of the experiment, which was a failure, was\ngiven by Professor James (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 657), but it appears\nto ms to be of such extreme importance in the endeavour to estimate\nthe significance of the Phinuit personality that I give the details.\nMrs. Blodgett sent Professor James a glove that her sister wore on the\nday she wrote the letter, and the lining from her sister's hat. The\noriginal copy of what purported to be the letter\u2014sent to Professor\nJames by Mr. J. M. Piper, the father-in-law of Mrs. Piper, and after\nwards returned to him\u2014 I have been unable to obtain. It was either\nlost or destroyed. Mrs. Blodgett, howei er, made a substantial copy of\nit, and I reproduce her copy of it here, with her remarks. Mr. Piper,\nas appears from one of his communications to Professor James, had\nmany sittings for the purpose of obtaining the letter, and was quite\nconfident that he had been conversing with the \"spirit ''of Hannah\nWild.\nCopy of Letter dictated by Phinuit.\n1. Dear Sister,\u2014In the bottom of my trunk in the attic with my\nclothes I have placed a little money, and some jewels given to me, as you\nknow, by mother, and given to her by grandfather who has now passed\naway. Bessie, I now give to you ; they are all I have. I wish I could have\nmore. It has grieved mo not a little not to have given the Society something,\nbut as you know, sister, I am unable to do so. If it he possible I will give\nthem my presence in spirit. [Sister left no trunk. Never lived in any house\nwith an attic. Mother never gave her any jewels. Mother's father died in\n1835. Mother died in 1880, and gave all her jewels to me. These jewels had\nbeen previously given to mother by myself. Sister left money, and could\nhave given the Society some had she chosen to do so.]\n2. The table-cover which 1 worked one year ago I want you to give\nsister Ellen, John's wife. The reason I did not dispose of them before will\nhe a satisfactory proof of spirit return. My dearest sister, should you ever\nmarry, as I think you will, take the money and use it as you think best, to\nbuy a wedding outfit. [She never worked a table-cover. I worked one and\ngave her. Brother John died when five years old. There is no one by the\nname of Ellen connected with the family. She did think I would marry,\nbut knew that I had plenty of money to buy an outfit.]\n8. Do not dress in mourning for me, for if it be true the spirit can return\nI want to see you dressed in light, not black. Not for me now, my dear sister\nBessie. Try to be cheerful and happy through your married life, and when\nyou hear from me\u2014this for you a copy, \"remember sister Hannah is not\ndead, only passed out of the body.\" I will give you a beautiful description\nof our life there and of my darling mother if I see her. [Hannah always\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Tmnee. 71\nwore black, and often said it would be wicked for me to take it off, for my\nchild always said, \" Mamma, you will always wear black for me,\" and I have\nworn black for twenty years, ever since my child died.]\n4. In regard to brother John I forgot to say I worked him a pair of\nslippers, and they are in the bottom of that old-fashioned carpet-lwig of mine,\nwith the check silk handkerchief of grandma which your uncle Ezra brought\nfrom California. The bag hangs in my room, in the closet. [Brother John\ndied July 10th, 1856, aged five years. Hannah never worked him any\nslippers. She did embroider a memorial piece with the date of his death on.\nThis was framed, and has hung on the wall since I860. There has been no\nold carpet-bag in the family since 185ti, when we moved. Sister Hannah\nmade it into a floor-mat, which I now have on the floor ; it was between the\nkitchen and the sitting-room when Hannah died, and had been there for\nyears. We had a check silk handkerchief that came from England, but not\nfrom yrandma. One grandma died in 1815, the other about I860. Never\nwas any Ezra connected with the family. My husband was in California from\n1868 to 1870. His name is Clutrles.]\n5. The wreath of flowers which we pressed and was laid on mother's\ncasket keep for your children, if you have any. Always remind them it is a\ntoken from Aunt Hannah. I shall be with you, dear sister, if possible. All\nthe little things I have done in this way is for the purpose of giving you tests,\nas I call them. If I can produce a copy of this after I have jwissed out you\nwill fully understand that I am as conscious in the spirit, and have in my\nmemory the things concerning this letter of which I now write. [We had no\nwreath of flowers on mother's casket. A friend sent a bunch of lilies tied\nwith white ribbon. These were put iuside mother's casket. A wreath of solid\ngreen English ivy was placed on top of the casket and was buried with the\ncasket. It was I alone who arranged the wreath.]\n6. In my little chest you will find two copies of the Woman's Journal,\nnot to be disturbed until I write a copy of this. Tell my particular friend,\nMargaret Dow, I am sorry I left matters so unsettled in connection with the\npaper. But notwithstanding all, I will make a satisfactory explanation if it\nis possible for me to return. This thing concerns me here, as you know it\nwas my life work there. Dear sister, the reason for writing this is to floor\nthe fact of spirit return, as I know no human being can produce a copy of\nthis, and no other spirit but my own. Dear sister, you say you want a test\nof my spirit return. I shall now copy this, so there will be no mistake. I\nmay mix things up a little, but I do it as a test for my sister. [We had a\nsmall chest which at the time of Hannah's death was full of jKtpers and tracts\non different subjects, and this contained, among other things, perhaps as\nmany as thirty copies of the Woman's Journal. The chest was not Hannah's,\nand she never called it hers. It was my father's school chest, and we all\ncalled it the \" night-gown chest,\" as it was kept for that purpose until 1874,\nwhen my boy died. Hannah called it the night-gown chest all through her\nsickness. No such person as Margaret Dow is known to us.]\nThe following points may also be noted. They are taken from con\ntemporary letters [1887] written by Professor James and Mr. J. M.\nPiper, and were obtained by the latter from Phinuit.\n\f72 Mr. R. Hodgson.\n1. The name of the writer of the letter was Miss Hannah Wild. [True.]\n2. \" You [Mrs. Blodgett] were married last summer [188<i], after your\nsister's death.\" [My sister died July 28th, 1886. I was married in the\nfollowing winter, December 18th, 188<i.]\n3. \" There was an agreement between you and your sister that her letter\nwas not to be opened till the 10th of October, 1887.\" It was also alleged that\nthis date was mentioned in the letter. [Absolutely wrong.]\n4. \"Miss Wild has given the following description of her former self :\nEyes, bluish grey. [Correct.] Hair, dark brown sprinkled with grey. [Her\nhair was not dark brown but was light brown, and I do not think she had a\ngrey hair in her head.] Nose, retrousse. [Wrong.] Teeth, peculiar in\nappearance, some of them artificial. [Her teeth were very good, and so even\nthat many asked if they were not false. She had four filled, but not one\nartificial.] And also stated that it was her custom to comb her hair straight\nback and do it up in a coil behind. [Wrong. She parted her hair in the\nmiddle, combed it down on each side, and wore it in a \"French twist\"\nbehind.] My recollection is that she said her age was 48, but I will not be\npositive.\" [Her age was 51.]\nIn 1888, Mrs. Blodgett made an appointment by letter with Pro\nfessor James, to meet him and myself at my office, 5, Boylston Place, on\nthe afternoon of May 29th, and I arranged an appointment with Mrs.\nPiper for the Wednesday morning, May 30th, without, of course, men\ntioning any names. I was present at the sitting and took notes, which are\nreproduced in the next account. The statements in the round brackets\nwere made by Mrs. B. during the sitting ; those in square brackets are\nexplanatory, and have been made by myself since ; the other state\nments were made by Phinuit, as taken down by me during the sitting.\n[ sent these notes recently to Mrs. B., requesting her to supplement my\nstatements by further explanations, and she has given me a fuller\naccount of the sitting, which appears to me to be in the main accurate,\nand has also added detailed notes of explanation. I think it desirable\nto give both my own original notes and Mrs. B.'s fuller account,\nespecially as there was much important matter that I was unable to\ntake down during the sitting. After the usual beginning, Phinuit\nduring most of the sitting purported to be repeating the words of\nMrs. B.'s sister.\n[From notes of R. H.]\nYou have a sister here, and did you ever find out about that letter ?\nAnna. Hannah. Hannah Wild. She calls you Bessie Blodgett. You\nwas in an audience and a message was thrown to you. She'll tell you all\nabout that. How's the Society\u2014the women you know 1 Moses. He's in\nthe body. I want to tell you about that letter.\n[Phinuit gropes on the floor with hand to get a small leather bag, which\nMrs. B. had taken into the room without saying anything about it to Mrs.\nPiper. Phinuit takes bag in lap, saying \" Mine.\" Tries to open it, but fails.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 73\nMrs. B. opens it. Mrs. B. says that her sister usually had much difficulty\nin opening the bag. ]\n[Takes spectacles, hair.] That's mine. Picture of mine here. [Mrs. B.\nshook her head. Finally Phinuit produced a photograph of Miss Hannah\nWild, tied up in a small parcel with other objects.] That's the picture.\n(Truly I didn't know that picture was there.)\n[Me letter, i.e., as Mrs. B. explains, the will of her sister.] This is to\nyou. That was mine to you. I wrote it and gave it to you. That was my\nfeelings at the time. I felt there was something that would never divide us.\nWherever you go and whatever you do, don't vary from the instructions\nI gave you there.\nYou remember my dress and my comb. You remember what I told you\nto do with my money. I told you personally, on my death-bed. Alice. Our\nsister's little girl. She is a namesake. (Shall I give her the money ?) Yes.\n(What is this ?) [Giving Mrs. P. a paper in a yellow envelope.] Alice has\nwritten here for the disposition of the money. [Wrong.] This is my little\nniece. Mother's here. [Fingering the envelope and paper.] Where's the\ndoctor? (He's home.) Where's brother? (I don't know.) I'll tell you\nabout him in a minute. Alice wrote this,\u2014Sister Alice.\nWho's Sarah ? That belongs to gentleman over there. Sarah Obs,\nHobs. (Hodge ?) Hodge, Odge. [See below.]\nWhere's my great big silk handkerchief I (The little niece has got it.\nYou gave it to her.) Where's my thimble ? (How many brothers have you\ngot in spirit-life ?) One,\u2014two,\u2014three. Who's Henry ? He's in the spirit,\nbut not with us\u2014a good way off. He has been here weeks.\nDo you remember I told you it would be ringing a church bell ? (City\nHall bell.)\n[Asked, concerning the contents of the yellow letter.] Alice wrote to\nknow about some money and the children. [Wrong.]\nWho's William and the doctor ? Brother William. I've found him.\nHe's all right. Don't worry about him. William's influence is stronger\nthan mine. He'll come to see you every day and every hour. W7hat do you\nthink about the lot ! (What lot !) The lot where he was buried.\n[Concerning the bag.] That's my own. I give it to you.\n[Asked concerning the contents of the sealed letter which she had\nwritten on her death-bed.] Sacred and religious. I remember something\nabout elevation of myself.\nWilliam Henry is better out of the world than he was in it.\n(Cousin Elizabeth living ?) She's passed out of the body. [Mrs. B. writes\non June 6th, 1888, that Elizabeth is still living.]\nDo you remember the morning you rubbed me ? [Mrs. Blodgett writes :\n\"Cannot recall any particular morning I rubbid sister. I did it every\nmorning, and she would put her arms around me and kiss me and say how\ngood I was.'\"]\n(Can you tell me what I did with the instrument that the doctor told\nme ?) You know what I did. I'm here and I want you to know it. Brother\nHenry was a queer genius. (Do you know what your brother Fred died\nwith i) It was in his stomach. He passed out suddenly, congestion of\norgans in the stomach.\n\f74 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nYou go up in my rooms and sit there. [This, as I remember it, was an\ninjunction and not a dogmatic statement.] (Can you tell me anything new\nI've got in my home ?) Give me the little one. [Meaning the picture.] It's\ntaken from this and elevated larger. [No reference to change of house, A'C.\u2022\nof which Mrs. B. was thinking.]\n[Mrs. B. picked something wrapped in silk out of the bag and asked what\nit was. Mrs. P. took it in her hand.] That's mother's chain.\nSarah Hudson. [Here Phinuit explained that there was no \"g\" in the\nname, and that Sarah Hodson was a friend of Hannah.] Sarah's in the\nbody. [Mrs. Blodgett thinks that I made a mistake in noting this, and\nthat Phinuit said that Sarah was not in the body.]\nMm. Blodgett writes on June 6th, 1888 :\u2014\nI write t i inform you that I have just received a letter from Philadelphia\nsaying the lady, Mrs. Elizabeth Wild, who Mrs. Piper said was dead, is\nliving, and in much better health than she was two years ago when I heard\nfrom her. Perhaps you will remember sister Hannah said she went to see\nher after she left the body. I think I can explain why she said so. The\nletter which I brought from sister to have the medium read, and which she\ndid not read correctly, was first written \"Did you go to cousin Elizabeth\nafter you left the body ? \" Sister Alice then thought we had heard of that,\nand so wrote the note which you read, and put it into the same envelope.\nThe m ire I think of our sitting the more strange points I see in it. It\nwas all true, yet not one word I did not know.\nAnother point : Sister Hannah was so slow and took so long to tell a\nstory. Shs would go all around the st;iry before she would touch the point,\nand you know that was not the case when we were sitting. Every medium I\nsit with says it is because I am so clear and my magnetism is so strong that\nthey can get better tests.\nI almost know it was not sister for this reason. She said I was to go sit\nin her room. I did sit th-ira every day until we moved, and have wanted to\nbo much sine:? that I feel that it must hava ctntc from me. It is very\nwonderful how qaick she got into my magnetism. This is the point I want\nto find out\u2014did I enter the medium, or did she enter me, or was there a\nthird party, and if so, who or what is the third party !\nMrs. Blodgett writes on June 10th, 1888 :\u2014\nI have just received a letter saying Sarah Hodson, of Waterbury, Conn.,\nis living, and is better than she was two years ago, when last sister Hannah\nheard from her.\nMrs. Blodgett writes on July 10th, 1890 :\u2014\nI have written from my own notes of sitting as I took them down that\nnight. Yours are very good. Only, not knowing the parties, you seem to\nhave misplaced one or two things. About the photo : I am sure I did not\nknow it was there, as I brought another one, which I showed Professor\nJames and you the night before. Also, what you call a letter was her will.\nShe did not give me name of Alice until she took mother's chain in hand.\nI cannot remember much about the place I have marked with a cross ;\nonly I know she was religious, and did say something about it. I know the\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 7*\nreason. I tried to get her to tell me her funeral text, but she did not.\n[This concerns the passage in my notes, referring to the contents of the\nsealed letter. \u2014R.H.]\nPlease note.\u2014Brother Joseph was travelling. She did not tell me where\nhe was. Alice's letter I did not know. That was not correct. Sarah Hod-\nson. Did not know. That was wrong. [According to my notes taken\nduring the sitting, Phinuit was right about this.\u2014R.H.] Cousin Elizabeth\nalso. But what I knew was most all correct, except tho bag. She said that\nwas hers, and it never was [though Miss Wild had frequently used it].\nShe took no notice of Maria's scissors in the bag, nor of the letter which\nwas wrapped in rubber cloth. [Maria was my husband's first wife. Sister\nhad known her, and also said many times during her sickness, when he went\naway, \"When I die, I will tell Maria all about him, how good he has been\nto me. \"]\n[Account by Mrs. Blodgett.]\n1. \" Bessie, Betsie Blodgett, my sister. How glad I am to see you ! I\nam Anna, Hannah, your sister, Hannah Wild. How's father and all the\nfolks ? Oh ! I am so glad to see you ! \"\n2. \"Saw you once before in that audience. Threw a message at you.\"\nMrs. B. : \" Where was it '? \"\nP. : \" Oh, I will tell you all about that.\"\n3. \" How's the Society, Lucy Stone and all of them? \"\n4. \" Moses is here. He is in the body. \"\n5. \" Want to tell you about my letter.\" (Gropes around floor for bag,\nwhich I had taken in and which Mrs. P. had not seen.) \" My photo in that\nbag.\" (Could not open the bag. I opened it.) Kept pulling things out of\nbag, saying, \" Picture of mine in here.\" Finds picture.\n6. Taking spectacles in hand. \" These are my old glasses. I have read\nmany precious truths with them.\"\n7. Taking hair switch. \" That's mine. I made it. Hard work, but I\ndid it.\"\n8. Picks up the will, which she had shaken out of the envelope when she\nfound picture. \"This is to you. I wrote it and gave to you. That was my\nfeelings at the time I wrote it. You did not think as I did. You made me\nfeel sad sometimes. But you did take good care of me. I always felt there\nwas something that would never part us. Do just as I told you to. Don't\nvary at all. You remember about my dress ? Where's my comb 1 You\nremember about my money ? I told you what to do with that. That ain't\nwritten in this paper. I told you that on my death-bed.\"\n9. \" How is Alice ? \" Mrs. B. : \" What Alice ! \" P. : \" The little girl\nthat's a namesake.\"\n10. Takes Alice's letter in yellow envelops. Mrs. B. : \" What is in\nthat?\" P. tore it open, saying: \"She wants to know what's going to be\ndone with the money.\" Mrs. B. : \" Shall I give Clara part of the money ? \"\nP. : \" Yes.\"\n11. \" Mother is here. Where's doctor ? Where's brother 'I \"\n12. Takes mother's chain in hand. It was wrapped in silk. I said,\n\f76 Mr. R. Hodgson.\n\"Hannah, tell me whose and what is that?\" Feels of tassel on end of\n\u2022chain. P. : \" My mother's chain. Alice Wild, my mother, and Alice Wild,\nmy sister, wrote this letter.\"\n13. \"Who's Sarah?\" I asked, \"Sarah Grover?\" \"No. Sarah\n.Obb\u2014Hodg \" At last, after pointing to Mr. Hodgson, said it belonged\nto him. Then said it was \" Sarah Hodson. \"\n14. P. : \"Where is my big silk handkerchief?\" Mrs. B. : \"I gave it to\nClara. You told me to.\" P. : \"Where is my thimble?\" Mrs. B. : \"I\n.don't know.\" P. : \"I saw you put it into this bag.\"\n15. Mrs. B. : \" Can you tell me, sister, how many brothers you have\nin spirit-life ? \" P. : \" One, two, three.\"\n16. \" Who's Henry ? He is in spirit a good way off.\"\n17. Mrs. B. : \" Can you tell me where that letter is now that you wrote ? \"\nP. : \" It is at home, in tin box.\" Mrs. B. : \" Can't you tell me more about\nit?\" P. : \"I have told you. It would be like ringing church bells if I\n\u2022could come back.\"\n18. \" Where's William and doctor ?\" Mrs. B. : \" Hannah, you tell me\nwhere William is ? \" P. : \" He is here. I found him.\" Mrs. B. : \"How\nlong has he been ? \" P. : \" Weeks. You know all about it. He sticks to\nyou all the time every day. William wants to know how you like that lot.\"\nMrs. B. : \" What lot i \" P. : \" You ought to know. You bought it to bury\nhim in. William is better out of the world than in it. He was a strange\nfellow. He don't like that lot. Do you ? \" I answered, \"No.\"\n19. \" Cousin Elizabeth is here.\" Mrs. B. : \" Hannah, did you go to see\nher the day you died ?\" P. : \" I never did die.\"\n20. Mrs. B. : \" Do you know what I did with instrument doctor told me\nto do ?\" P. : \" You know what you did.\"\n21. Mrs. B. : \"Can you tell me what brother Fred died with?\" P. :\n*'Oh, sudden ; it was his stomach. Congestion of stomach. \"\n22. Mrs. B. : \" Can you tell me anything new that I have got since you\nwent away ? \" P. took small picture and said, \" One from this. A larger\none, elevated.\"\n23. Closed by saying it was church time. She must go, as she never\nmissed church.\n[Notes by Mrs. Blodgett on the foregoing account, 1888.]\n1. Correct. Kept slapping me with her hand. Just like sister. My\nname was Bessie Barr when sister died.\n2. Went to Lake Pleasant four weeks after she died. John Slater,\nmedium, said, pointing to me in a large audience, \" Lady here who wants to\nhave you know she is hare. Henry, the lame man, is with her. She wants\nto know about big silk handkerchief. Says she will tell you what is in that\npaper soon.\"\n3. I was down to Boston to attend the Women's Suffrage meetings. Lucy\nStone is the editor of the Woman'a Journal, and wrote a piece about sister\nwhen she died.\n4. Don't know any Moses.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. IT\n5. Bug contained her glasses, hair, mother's chain, Maria's scissors, which\nshe did not take out, and her letter, wrapped up in ruhber cloth, which she\ndid not touch ; also her will, in which was the picture. It must have been in\nenvelope when I put will in envelope, for I did not know that I had taken\nthe photo with me ; also a letter which sister Alice had written for Hannah\nto tell what was in it. The letter was sealed.\n6. Correct.\n7. Her own hair, which she had learnt to weave into a switch.\n8. Correct,\u2014but I do not know anything about any comb. The paper\nwas about her books and dresses and all her personal effects except money.\n9. Sister Alice (living) had a child named Alice Olivia, and Hannah\nalways called her Alice. The rest call her Ollie. Hannah did not like it,\nas she was named Alica after my mother, and Olivia after my sister's\nhusband's mother. Hannah took pains to have us all know she did not\nwant the Alice dropped.\n10. I do not know what was written in the letter. Sister Alice wrote\nit. But what was said about the contents was not correct.\n11. My husband is a doctor, known to Hannah. I have one brother\nliving, named Joseph, who travels most of the time.\n12. The chain was a long chain of mother's. It was cut in two after\nmother died. Hannnh had worn one half. The half which I took to the\nsitting had not been worn since mother's death, and it had a tassel on the\nend, different from the half Hannah had worn. Did not tell who wrote the\nletter until she got the name with the chain.\n13. Sarah Hodson was a friend of sister's in Waterbury, Conn. I had\nthought of her the night before when I met Mr. H., a3 she also came from\nLondon, England.\n14. The handkerchief was a large silk one given to sister by a lady who\nlived with us for yeara, and it came from England. I did not know I had\nput Hannah's thimble into the bag, but found on return to the hotel that it\nwas there on the bed, with the rest of the things I had taken out of the bag\nbefore starting for the sitting.\n15. I asked her how mnny brothers because William had only been dead\nsince March 27th, same year (1888). Wanted to have her tell me if she had\nseen him. \" Three \" was correct.\n16. This Henry was my mother's only male cousin, and she had lived\n\u2022with him all her life until she was married. His picture hangs in the house.\nHe was lame. The same one John Slater had told of before. (See Note 2.)\n17. The letter was in the bag wrapped up in rubber cloth. Sister did say\nwhen we put the letter in tin box, \" It would be like ringing the City Hall\nbell if I can come back.\"\n18. I had bought him a lot in Wood-lawn Cemetery, N.Y. His wife\nwanted him buried there. We wanted to take him to our home, and bury\nhim by mother. Brother was very proud, and we thought that the lot was\nnot as nice as he would like.\n19. When sister died Cousin Elizabeth was sick and dreamt at about tha,\n\f78 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nsame hour some one was dead at our house, so I asked question. She lives\nin Philadelphia. Mrs. P. would not answer the question.\n20. Dr. Blodgett had to come and inject morphia into sister every few\nhours for the last few days, her pain was so great. He made me do it the\nlast two days. It almost killed me to do it. I wanted to see if she knew it.\nWould not answer my question. I remember I asked a number of questions,\nbut Mrs. P. would not answer. She kept saying, \" I want you to know it\nis me, Hannah Wild, Hannah Wild. \"\n21. Brother Fred dropped dead as soon as he reached the sidewalk after\ngetting out of a street car in Chicago, 111. Hannah went on there. The\ndoctor told her it was heart disease.\n22. Dr. and I had got married nince Hannah died. Built a new house and\nmoved into it. Took father to live with us. I wanted her to tell me about\nit. She seemed to think I went up and sat in her room, and I could not, as\nthe house was rented to another family. I did have a large picture made of\nsister for father's Christmas present, and it hangs on the wall. Sister\nHannah's cousin made it, and I should have thought she would have said\nsomething about him, as he took a new picture of her every time she went to\n\u2022see him.\n23. Just like sister, never missed church. It was Decoration Day, and she\nalways went to the service.\nTIia next reports, which have been made by Mrs. Blodgett, with the\nassistance of my notes taken during the sitting, and which have been\nrevised by me, refer to sittings which Mrs. Blodgett requested me to\nhave on her behalf, for the purpose, if possible, of obtaining the letter\nwritten by her sister. After her sitting in May, Mrs. Blodgett told\nMrs. Piper who she was.\nSitting on August 1st, 1888.\nI sent a lock of hair which I had cut from sister's head after her death.\nPhinuit thought that it was not Hannah's hair, then that it was, but that\nsomeone had handled it. He then purported to give a copy of the letter :\n.\"It's something about Hannah's early history, that letter is.\" \"At one\ntime I met a person whom I loved. A circumstance in our affection changed\nmy whole life. Had it not been for this one thing, I should have been\nmarried and happy. Consequently I went into religious work and did all the\ngood I could. The circumstance that marred my happiness regarded my\nintended marriage. Whoever reads this letter after I am gone will know the\nreason why I remained as Hannah Wild. When I am gone I will return and\nrepeat word for word this letter.\" \"It has been opened, I'm sorry to say.\"\nPhinuit said that if he had a longer piece of hair next sitting he could\ngive the letter word for word.\n[The fact referred Ui in the above dictated letter is correct. It was the\none sorrow of sister's life. But we learn from Professor James that it was\nnot what sister wrote in her death-bed letter. Phinuit had previously been\ntold that the letter had been examined for comparison with his first\nstatements.]\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 79\nSitting on October 3rd, 1888.\nI sent Mr. Hodgson a large lock of hair, and also a tidy which sister had\nfinished a few days before her death, requesting him to ask the name of my\nfirst husband\u2014the middle name he was to be very particular about\u2014also to\nask the name of my only child, who died at the age of ten, whom Hannah\nhad taken care of for years. Had names been given correctly, it would have\ncut off all thought-transference as far as Mr. Hodgson was concerned.\nR. H. placing hair and tidy in Mrs. P.'s hands. P. : What is this for ?\nR. H. : You must tell. P. : Hannah Wild. Betsy gave you this. I'll tell\nyou all about this directly. R. H. : What was the name of Mrs. Blodgett's\nfirst husband ? P. : John Henry or Henry John Clifford. [The name\nof my first husband was John Rothmall Barr. I know a Mr. John Henry\nClifford, and his daughter tells me that she is almost sure that Hannah\nhad worked upon the tidy in their house.] R. H. : What was the\nname of her boy ? P. : Willie. [The name of my child was John Marion\nBarr.] P. : Hannah says, Ask my sister Bessie if she doesn't know what I\nsaid to her last. It's awful hard work to bring back recollections. \" I said\nthis, ' It's hard work to be ill and leave your friends in the body.' \"\nThe letter was said to be as follows :\u2014\n\" I left a great deal of my work unfinished. Could I have been able to\nstay here longer, I should try to be of some benefit to those who were lean\ning more particularly on me. There's Mr. Town has always been very, very\nkind to me. I had some talk with him regarding matters in the church which\nnobody knows but himself and me, and a sister of his. After I have passed\nout and returned to earth to dictate this letter, and it is opened, please give\n1,000 [here Phinuit wrote 1,000 on my block-book.\u2014R. H.] dollars for the\nbenefit of the church.\u2014Hannah Wild.\" \" I told my sister should I come\nback and dictate this letter it'll be like the ringing of the village church bell.\"\n[Hannah never said it was hard to be ill ; neither did she think it hard to\ndie. She left no work unfinished. I sat by her side hour after hour and\nwrote down to whom every article she possessed should be given. She made\nall her own arrangements for her funeral and selected the verse for her\nfuneral sermon. No one was leaning on her. My sister had a friend named\nMr. Thomas F , who was kind to her and who had some talk with her on\nchurch matters\u2014Hannah often called him Mr. Tom. She had worked on the\ntidy in the presence of this gentleman and his sister. My sister made me\npromise not to give any money to the church, as they had built a new one in\na fashionable part of the city and closed the old one where it was needed.\nShe never said \" The village bells,\" but always the \" City Hall bell.\" See\nsitting of May 30th, 1888, Note 17, p. 77. We learn from Professor James\nthat this was not the substance of Hannah's death-bed letter.]\nP : Hannah wants to give you a test to her sister, something that no one\nelse knows, but she cannot recollect it now. [There was a test between sister\nAlice and Hannah, but I do not know what it was. The test has never been\ngiven, and sister Alice has seen the accounts of our attempts to obtain com\nmunications from Hannah.]\nThe next attempt to obtain the letter was in 1889, when Mrs. Bhxlgett\nand myself had two sittings, of which the following are the reports,\n\fSO Mr. R. Hodgson.\nmade by Mrs. Blodgett with the assistance of my notes taken during\nthe sitting, and finally revised by me.\nSitting on May 28th, 1889.\nP. : Anna's here. No, Hannah ! Hannah says: \"Bessie, you haven't\nbeen feeling very well of late.\" Mrs. B. : No. What has been the matter ?\n[No answer.] P. : What noise did you hear the night before this ? Mrs. B. :\nRapping. [I had heard a rap that seemed to come on the bed the night\nbefore, but could get no answer from it.] P. : Hannah did that. [Here\nfollowed some talk about father.]\nMrs. B. : Can you give us a copy of Hannah's letter this morning ?\nP. : Hannah says that she did mention a sum of money to the church. Some\nmoney for the benefit of, for educating the children. Mrs. B. : What-\nchurch ? [I asked what church to see if she would say the old Baptist or the\nnew Baptist.] P. : Baptist. P. : Where's Aunt Elizabeth ? Mrs. B. : She\nought to be in Philadelphia. You said she had passed out, the last time I\nwas here. (See sitting of May 30th, 1888, pp. 76, 77, Note 19.) She had not.\nP.: [Made some remark about being \"confused,\" and returned to the\n\"letter.\"] Also about the doctor, when he should have changed his sur\nroundings, if she had been with him, she would be of great assistance to him.\nIf she had stayed in the body she would have helped the brother. Mrs.\nB. : Are the words \" My brother\" halfway down the second page ? [I got\nan impression that they were there.] P. : Yes ; halfway down the second\npage. [Some obscurity here in the notes. Either, \" Got good memory. I\nsee the things over again,\" or, \"Not a good memory. I say the same things\nover again.\"\u2014R.H.] [Hannah's memory was very good, and she was the\nencyclopedia for the whole family.]\nP. : [Fingering a \"waist\" which Mrs. B. had placed on her lap.] She\nwore that when she was sick. She knows that. [The \" waist \" belonged to\nHannah, who had worn it frequently, but not when she had her last sickness.J\nMrs. B. : [Taking out an envelope containing a lock of hair and some\nwriting and giving them to P.] Tell me about these. P. : Letter to her.\nIt ain't written nice. [The letter was written by Hannah's niece to Hannah,\nand was written nicely. The lock of hair was from the same person.] P. :\n[Fingering the hair.] Do you know who Alice is ? This comes in connection\nwith Alice. This is the mother's. Mrs. B. : Alice is the mother's name.\nP. : That hair is in the spirit. [Wrong.]\nMrs. B. [Putting some imitation birds' eyes into P.'s hands.] Tell me\nabout these. P. : Eyes. Cats' eyes. Came from Europe. Mrs. B. : Did\nthey come from France ? P. : No. More German like. [A box of birds'\neyes, from which these were taken, was a prize drawn by father in the first\nParis Exposition for a white crane which he had sent, about 1847 or 1848, I\ncannot recall the exact year. Hannah was very proud of them and would\nhave known them at once. But she had never handled them. We were\nonly allowed to look at them in a glass case.]\nMrs. B. : [Puts a pin into P.'s hands.] P.: Mother's influence. Got the\nlittle nephew here. Your mother's pin brings the nephew. He had some\ntrouble with head, throat, and stomach. You gave this to her. [It was my\nmother's pin, but had been given to her by my father. My boy died of\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 81\nconsumption.] P. : She used to have a chain with this. Mrs. B. : Yes. I\ngave it to Alice. [A chain was sometimes worn with the pin.]\nMra. B. [Handing P. a glove and stocking belonging to her child, the\nnephew referred to, asked : ] Who is there in Heaven that I should love best ?\nP. : You ought to know. [Hannah had always kept the glove and stocking\nin the family Bible, and would have known them at once.]\nMrs. B. [Puts a round box, from which she took an ear-spoon and eye-\nprobe, in P.'s hands.] P.: Sister's influence. [Correct.] [Concerning the\near-spoon.] That's her ear-thing. [Fingering the probe a long time, asked\nwhat it was, and at last said :] That's a probe. [I had hoped to make\nHannah say that she was very deaf\u2014as she was\u2014a fact never given by P.]\nP.: [Concerning a chain which I put into Phinuit's hands.] Before she\npassed out she broke this chain three or four times and tied it up with\nthread. Mother's influence comes with this chain. It was mother's first.\nMother gave it to her. [See sitting of May 30th, 1888, pp. 76, 77, Note 12.\nMother gave her chain to me. I had it cut in half, and gave one portion\nto Alice, and the other portion to Hannah. The piece belonging to Alice\nI took to my sitting of May 30th, 1888. Alice never wore it, but Phinuit got\nthe name from it. The other piece was that which I gave here to Phinuit,\nand had been worn by Hannah. It had also been broken and tied up with\nthread by Hannah in as many as three places ; by myself in two places when\nshe was sick in bed. It was tied with thread when Phinuit held it.]\nMrs. B. : Ask Hannah who was there when she wrote the letter. P. :\nYou were there and another lady, not her sister, but your sister. [Some\nconfusion, but no help by Mrs. B. See below.\u2014R. H.]\nP. : Fred's here ; says, How's Joe ? Mrs. B. : Yes ; that's my brother.\n[Fred was my dead brother. Joe is my only living brother.] P. : Ella in Joe's,\nsurroundings. [I found soon after the sitting that brother Fred had a sister-\nin-law in Chicago named Helen, who is living and is often called Ella. But\nmy brother Joe does not know of any such person. I did not think until\nrecently (1891) of my father's cousin's children, of New York State, in con\nnection with this communication. We played together as children, and were\nlike one family. Their names were Fred, Anna, Joe, and Ella. They were\nall known to my brother Fred. Further, this second cousin Fred went to\nChicago about the year 1865, and both father and I think that we heard he\nwas drowned on the lakes. Anyway, we have not heard from him since about\nthat time. Joe, Ella, and Anna are living.] [The cousin Fred was not\ndrowned, as Mrs. B. supposed. She has since ascertained that he is still\nliving.\u2014R. H.]\nP. : Hannah's coming. Aunt Elizabeth is lame ; had a fall ; got\nrheumatism ; sore eyes. [Every detail incorrect, as I have since learned.]\nP. : She (Hannah) used to write for the papers, and she said in her letter\nthat she wanted the paper to be kept up as well as the church matters.\n[Hannah wrote many letters to Lucy Stone on Woman Suffrage. Some were\nprinted in the Woman's Journal. Hannah did say to me that I was to keep\nup that journal, but I cannot recall that she asked me to keep up any\nchurch matters.]\nP. : She wrote the letter on a stand. You and sister Alice were\nthere. She sat in a chair with big arms to it. Leant back tired. It'll\no\n\f82 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nbe like ringing the old church bell. Mrs. B. : The City Hall bell. P. : Yes,\nthat's it. [The account given of the writing of the letter and the persons\npresent is correct.]\nP.: Much in the letter about the doctor. She speaks about the piece\nof land in the letter, and that's in connection with the doctor also.\nAnd it's four pages. P.S.\u2014And this is all settled satisfactory to me. Sister\nHannah. About the church, land, doctor, paper, brother, and helping\nthe doctor in change of surroundings. [My husband had bought a new piece\nof land since Hannah's death, and had built a new house and moved into it.\nBut I cannot see how Hannah could have helped him. I think she would\nhave helped brother if she had lived.] [We learn from Professor James that\nthe above details are not the substance of Hannah's death-bed letter.]\nSitting on May 29th, 1889.\nr. : Are you well ? Mrs. B. : No. I want a medical examination. P. :\nNo real organic disease ; little weakness in kidney. Sometimes trouble in\nhead. Mrs. B. : What is the cause of the head trouble ? P. : That's because\nyou're a medium. R. H. : You must be careful, Doctor, as Mrs. Blodgett's\nhusband is a medical man. P. : You clear out. I won't do anything while\nyou're here. [R. H. leaves the room.] Mrs. B. : [Phinuit made a thorough\nexamination. Said I was perfect. This is not correct.] [R. H. recalled.]\nP. : Light complexioned person, grey hair, aquiline nose, full eye, square\nface, moustache, don't see any beard, much to do with new building. Marie\nin surroundings. [Maria was the name of my husband's first wife. Tho\ndescription does not answer to my husband. I do not know anyone who\ncorresponds to it.] P. : Esther also. [I do not know an Esther, nor, as far\nas I can ascertain, did Maria. My husband had an aunt of that name, who\ndied a long time ago.] Mrs. B. : Whom does Maria wish to talk to ? P. :\nGiven name is Charles, and he's across the country. [Charles is my husband's\nfirst name, and Maria called him Charles. He was in Holyoke, where we\nlive.]\n* \u2666 * * *\nMrs. B. : Is Hannah Wild here to-day ? P. : No. R. H. : Tell her she\ndid not give the letter correctly. P. : How do you know ? Have you read\nit? R. H. : No. James says so. [P. was angry, and said that James had\nbetter \" sharpen up his memory,\" &c, and finally said he would go and get\nHannah.] [Mrs. P. came out of trance, and after a short interval became\nentranced again.]\nP. : Miss Davis\u2014Hannah wants you to go and see her and say\nshe has a message for her. Will give it later on. [I do not know a Miss\nDavis. I know a Mrs. Davis, who was a widow when Hannah died. Hannah\nknew her, but was never in her house.] Mrs. B. : What was the maiden name\nof mother, and where was she born ? P. : You ought to know as well as\nHannah. [Hannah knew mother's maiden name. She was a perfect family\nencyclopedia.] P. : There's something in [the letter] about mother.\nMrs. B. : What happened to Hannah that Alice only knew ? P. : It\nhappened twice, and if it happened the third time Hannah would pass out.\nMrs. B. : Did it happen the third time ? P. : Yes. It was about mother.\n^Correct as far as I know. Sister Alice will not tell what it was, as she\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 83\npromised Hannah not to. It was about mother. Sister cannot say whether\nit happened three times or not, as she was not present at the death of Hannah,\nbut I have notes of every word Hannah spoke that day.] Mrs. B. : Whom\ndid you see just before you passed out ? P. : Mother. [She said she saw\nMary, but not mother.] P. : I say in the letter to my sisters Alice and\nBessie,\u2014If she could see her mother in spirit she would come back and tell\nyou of her experience with her mother, also of any other friends that I may\nmeet. I mention my brother also, the church, your happiness with the\ndoctor, and the surroundings. [Mixture of pronouns due to Phinuit.\u2014R. H.]\nP. : Mr. \"E.\" is here. He says, \"What is this all about?\" R. H. :\nTell him. P. : He says you must always send Phinuit away from the medium\nto ask and then come straight back to the medium and tell you. [This is the\ndevice that I suggested and carried out long before.\u2014R. H] [The results of\nthis sitting were submitted to Professor James. He replied : \"All this is not\nto the point. The sister's letter, as I remember it, contained none of these\nstatements.\"]\nAthkndum. (By B. H.)\nOn May 27th, 1891, Dr. Blodgett had a sitting with Mrs. Piper. Mrs.\nBlodgett and myself accompanied him, but Mrs. Blodgett remained at first in\nthe adjoining room. Phinuit, however (on behalf of \"Bessie's father\"),\ninsisted upon seeing Mrs. Blodgett, and then shortly afterwards refused to\nproceed unless Dr. Blodgett and myself left the room. Hannah purported to\nbe present. In the last part of the sitting Phinuit talked with Dr. Blodgett\nalone. My notes are too fragmentary to be of any value, but the main point\nis that no further attempt was made by Phinuit to give the letter, and\napparently not the slightest reference was made to it by either Phinuit or\nany of the sitters. No other information was given that inclined Mrs. Blod\ngett at all to bslieve that her sister was actually \"communicating.\" At a\nsitting on May 28th, 1891, Phinuit's first statement (Mrs. Piper entranced at\n12.10 p.m.) was : \" Been with Bessie. She's been writing, a few minutes\nago.\" On June 1st Mrs. Blodgett writes :\u2014\n\" Phinuit was correct. I was writing my notes out of book on different\npapers.\"\nTwo days later (June 3rd) Mrs. Blodgett sent me a letter to Phinuit,\nwhich I read at the beginning of a sitting on June 15th. This occasioned\nthe following statement from Phinuit, which had nothing to do with the\nletter :\u2014\n\" She's been reading a funny book. A life of somebody. She called on\nan old friend of Hannah's, somebody I told her to go and see. Hannah told\nher. Mrs. B. has a friend named Severance.\"\nMrs. Blodgett writes on June 17th :\u2014\n\" Really he [Phinuit] is doing wonderfully well as far as thought-trans\nference goes, but positive proof that it is not Hannah. Saturday night\n[June 13th] I gave a talk to the Young Women's Rooms about Helen Gar\ndener's new book, Is this your Son, my Lord? 14th. I did not go to see the\nfriend in body, but I know my mind went, and I wrote him the letter to\nask him what Phinuit told me to do when there. You will recall he said, I\nG 2\n\f(s-t Mr. R. Hodgson.\nmust go and see Mr. L and tell him I was sorry I had slighted him.\nYou will see by letter enclosed [dated and postmarked June 15th, and\nreferring to Mrs. B.'s letter of June 14th.\u2014R. H.] Mr .L did not see me\nin the Senate. That was my mind. Hannah never saw Mr. L , nor, to\nmy knowledge, ever heard me speak of him. He was my friend in W .\nThis is quite a point. I also know Hannah never heard of 'Severance.' I\nwrote him three letters, just before we were married, as doctor had seen him\nand bought the enclosed picture at Onset. I said on the 14th how I would\nlove to write him again now we were married and see if he would know it,\nor if Maria would.\"\n11. 0. F. Wadsworth, M.D., June 15th, 1888.\n[Appointment made by R. H. No name given.]\n[Notes made by R. H. during sitting.]\nThis sitting was a failure, though one or two incidents suggested to me\nthat the \"conditions\" of success were present had Phinuit received any\nassurance at the beginning that he was not confused. Thus there seemed to\nbe an approximation to the sitter's name in the first specific statement made\nby Phinuit: \"Got a lady here calling Watson-.\" And later on another\nattempt was made\u2014 Watson. But this may have been a mere coincidence,\nas altogether more than twenty statements and names were offered, almost\nall of which were wrong.\n12. Mrs. P. July Uth, 1888.\n[Appointments made by R. H. No name given.]\nMrs. P. had a sitting a few weeks previously, at which I was not present,\nand no written account of it was made at the time. Much of what was said\nby Phinuit at this first sitting appeared to Mrs. P. to be vague and\nirrelevant, but her father-in-law was described and alleged to be very ill,\nas was the case. There was an approximation made to the name P., which\nwas not, however, correctly given. Among other names mentioned, to\nwhich Mrs. P. could attach no special significance, the name Sarah was\ngiven and said to be that of her mother, and it was stated that she died from\na cancer. This was true, but Mrs. P. does not attribute much importance\nto this, as she afterwards heard that a similar statement was made to another\nsitter, to whom it did not apply.\nI took notes during the sitting of July 11th, at which the father-in-law,\nin the meantime deceased, was represented as appearing. His surname was\ncorrectly given. So also was the surname of the sitter's mother, but the\nsitter is not sure that she did not mention her mother's name at the previous\nsitting. In addition, eight Christian names were given, of which five (Sarah,\nFanny, Telly, Helen, Frank) were closely connected with the sitter. The\nother three names were also approximations. John and Thornahan were\nthe attempts to get the name of the father-in-law, Jonathan ; a lady relative\nwas mentioned as having a nickname Tete, and Pete would have been\ncorrect ; one of the sitter's five brothers is named Edgar, and Phinuit spoke\nof an \"Ed\u2014something.\" No other names were given by Phinuit. Several\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 85\nirrelevant and incorrect statements, however, were made, and a prophecy\nthat the sitter was going to California the next year was not fulfilled. In\naddition, the sitter made experiments with two locks of hair.\n1. Had great deal of sickness\u2014disease. Person has passed out of the body.\nDid this one have a cancer ? He had disease in stomach. Don't you\nremember the sighs he used to make ? You've got them mixed. [All wrong.\nThe hair of a living person,\u2014a lady.]\n2. This is lady's influence. She thought everything of you. I want to say\nthere's a misunderstanding all round in this influence. Weakness across\nchest and right round the heart. [All wrong. The hair of my father-in-law,\nMr. J. P., deceased.]\n13. Mr. John F. Brown. June and October, 1888.\nThe following accounts are by Mr. John F. Brown, a member of our\nSociety. Mr. Brown writes to me on February 20th, 1891, that he is\nfully convinced that Mrs. Piper's dealings with him have been false and\nfraudulent throughout. His opinion, I believe, is that Mrs. Piper pre\ntends to go into trance, proceeds by guesswork, questioning, ,fec, and\nadds such information as she has been able to obtain by secret inquiry\nbeforehand concerning the sitters. I understand that he attributes\nimportance to the details of all his visits to Mrs. Piper, and his\naccounts are therefore given in full.\nSitting with Mrs. Piper, June 11th, 1888. 9.30 a.m.\nThe bell was answered by a voice through the speaking-tube. I after\nward recognised the voice as Mrs. Piper's. I said I had an appointment and\nwas told to come up. Mrs. Piper met me at the door upstairs.\nWithout much delay she took me into the room adjoining, seated me in a\nchair, and after locking the door between the rooms and closing the shutters\nsat down in a rocking-chair in front of me. Said she supposed Mr. Hodgson\nhad told me how to talk to her when in the trance, about asking questions\nand answering what the Doctor said. I replied, \" Yes, I understand I can\nask any questions I wish to.\" This did not satisfy her ; said I should admit\nwhat the Doctor told me, if it was true ; that I should talk freely, and answer\nall his questions ; that by so doing much better results would be obtained.\nHaving settled this matter, which she seemed to consider of the greatest\nimportance, she speedily went into the trance.\nWhen fully under control, some Frenchy salutations were given and then\nthe Doctor said, \" Hallo ! John, I'm pretty well. How are you ?\" I said I\nwas well also and was pleased to make his acquaintance. Soon he spoke my\nlast name, getting it piecemeal and pronouncing it Bur-oun. Had some diffi\nculty with the name, said it over a number of times and asked me two or\nthree times what I called it. I said I was satisfied with what he called it and\ndid not help him out. Then he gave my middle name (Fenner), but did not get\nit quite right, gotin a d\u2014Fedner, or something like that, and seemed to think\nit was not quite right and asked me what it was. He kept saying it over,\ntrying to get it just right, and kept asking me what I called it. I said, \" Let\nit go that way, that's near enough.\" But he persisted, and finally, thinking\n\f86 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nthat ho knew already, for he came as near it as he possibly could and miss,\nI said, \" It is Fenner.\" \"Yes, yes,\" he replied, \" Fenner, that's it, Fenner.\"\nThen he spoke about my children, said I had two pretty children. I asked if\nthey were boys or girls. He said one was a boy, the older one ; the younger\nhe seemed to be in doubt about, was inclined to think it was a girl\u2014asked\nme which it was. I said that was for him to tell. He seemed a little pro\nvoked, and said he couldn't tell everything and that I must answer his\nquestions. He asked me two or three times, and finally said in a very decided\nmaimer that he wouldn't say another word until I answered the question. I\nthought for a moment that the sitting was at an end and also my acquaintance\nwith Dr. Phinuit. I wasted no words, however, and showed no irritation,\nbut very quietly told him to tell mo what he could and let the rest go. By\nthis time he had about concluded (supposing he did not already know, and I\nhave no special reason for thinking that he did) that the child was a boy, said\nit looked like a girl (he had already spoken of it as a baby) but that it might\nbe a boy.\nThere was something, however, that looked very much like finessing. I\nrode to Boston on my wheel, wearing long stockings and knee breeches.\nMrs. Piper said she took it I dissipated on the bicycle. I said. Yes, I had\nbeen riding, and some remarks were made about bicycle riding. Dr. Phinuit\ntook hold of my breeches at the knee and asked what I wore those for. I\nsaid, \"I must wear something.\" \"Yes, but what for you wear those?\"\n\" They look pretty, don't they 1\" \" Oh, I am not joking, I am in earnest.\nWhy don't you wear the long ones ? \" Then I tried to make him tell, but he\nwould not and said no more about it. The Doctor did not give up trying\npump me, but, having resolved beforehand to resist all such attempts as\nirregular and uncalled for, his efforts were in vain. At one time he said 1\nmust be frank and not try to mislead him, that I could put him on the wrong\ntrack if I wished. I assured him I would not be guilty of anything of that\nkind, and I certainly was not.\nAgain, he declared he was going to thrash me. I laughed and said it\ntook considerable of a man to do that. He said he could do it. I asked\nwhy he proposed to thrash mo. Instantly came the answer, sharp and\ndecided, \" Don't you say Ugh to me any more ; you say, Yes, sir.\" Then\nhe said he was coming to see me at my house. I told him to come along,\nI should be pleased to see him, and I wouldn't thrash him either, I didn't\nthrash spirits. He said I was wise not to try it.\nHe gave the name Edward for the older child, which is altogether wrong.\nThe name of the younger he did not give. The medium put her hand on\nher chest, rubbing it up and down, and Phinuit said there was or had been\nsomething the matter with one of the children. I asked which one. Said\nhe thought it was the younger, that ho would get all over it and that they\nwould both grow up and be strong and healthy. Said they were fine\nchildren and things of that sort. I asked if there were any more. He\nsaid, No. Would there be any more ? Said he seemed to see another\u2014\na girl\u2014but that had not come yet.\nBy-and-bye he spoke the name Fannie. I said, \" Who is Fannie ? \" At\nfirst he couldn't tell, but finally said it was Edward's mother. He called mo\na funny fellow, but did not explain in what way, and I couldn't get it out of\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 87\nhim. \" Oh, what a fine dog ! \" Said it was mine, and then asked me if it was\nmine. I didn't say whether I ever owned a dog or not. Said dogs liked me.\nI asked if folks liked me as well as dogs. He didn't answer the question very\ndirectly, but said I didn't make very many intimate friends, but I was a good\nman. Spoke of the girls I had been intimate with and said I had had a good\nmany \" escapades. \" Gave the names of two girls that I had thought a great\ndeal of. One was Louie, who was very congenial. We were very fond of each\nother. I asked why I did not marry Louie. The answer was, \" Because\nyou were crazy, cranky.\" Felt of the top of my head and said I had lost a\ngood deal of hair, but that he could have saved it seven or eight years ago.\nI asked how, and he mentioned some remedy which I do not remember, and\nsaid that would stop it from coming out any more. Felt of my fingers and\nasked if I did not come near losing one some years ago. Felt of the bones\nand joints as if trying to make out which finger it was. Asked me which it\nwas and if I had not had some such injury. I said merely that I had had\nsome injury to my fingers, and he went no further. Said that years ago I\nhad been bathing with a friend who came near being drowned ; tried to give\nthe person's name and asked me what it was. I said I used to go bathing\nsometimes and asked the Doctor the name of the person to whom he referred.\nThen he gave the name of a white-haired gentleman who knew me, and said\nthis gentleman knew the name of the friend who came near drowning.\nSeveral other names were given. I did not recogmse any such persons, but\ndid not say whether I did or not. He told me I was going to make a change\nin business within four months. I asked what sort of a change it would be,\nbut could not find out. When the opportunity presented itself, I was to\ntake it without hesitation\u2014the change would be greatly to my advantage.\nSaid I had been making some investments that had turned out well. The\nDoctor questioned me closely about this, but nothing further was elicited.\nAfter a time the Doctor said he was going away, but if I had any questions\nto ask I could do so. I said he had told me enough for once and asked if he\nwould come and see me again. Yes, he would. I asked if he would see my\nfriends in the spirit, talk with them and tell me all about myself and family\nwhen I came again. Yes, he would. \" Au revoir.\" \" Good-bye,\" and the\nmedium twisted, groaned and grated her teeth just as she did when going\ninto the trance, then stared about wildly and appeared to be coming to her\nself. She seemed surprised to see me and said, \" Are you here '! I didn't\nknow you were here.\" She acted bewildered for a moment and in answer to\nmy question said she felt dizzy. She asked if the sitting had been satis\nfactory. I replied that she had told me a good many things, but that I had\nnothing with which to compare it, never having sat before with the same\nkind of medium. Said she thought it very desirable for sitters to have seen\nother mediums, and that she would like to know if there wasn't someone\nelse who could do \"this\" and relieve her.\nWhen in the trance Mrs. Piper talked in a gruff, masculine voice, very\ndifferent from her own, and the Doctor's identity was well sustained\nthroughout. Everything connected with the trance seemed very natural,\nexcepting her surprise and bewilderment when coming out. It seemed to\nme that there was some assumption about this, but it may have been just as\ngenuine as the rest.\n\f88 Mr. M. Hodgson.\nStcoiul call on Mrs. Piper, June 13th, 1888. 9.30 a.m.\nI was a few minutes late, having let the car I wanted pass by and then\nhaving to wait a long time for another. I touched the electric knob and a\nvoice came through the speaking tube. The voice I recognised immediately\nas Mrs. Piper's. I said : \"I have another appointment with you, and will\ncome up.\" Hearing nothing more, I went upstairs, and waited at the door.\nNo one came, and I was thinking of knocking when the door opened and the\nSwedish servant-girl let me in. It was just ten minutes past the appointed\ntime when I sat down in the parlour. After waiting five minutes or more\nMrs. Piper came in. I said \" Good morning,\" and she asked if I had come\nfor a sitting for that hour. I said I had. She did not speak as though I had\nalready told her I had come for a sitting, but acted as though she would have\nme think she had had no previous conversation with me that day, and that it\nwas the girl who had answered my call. She seemed to be in no hurry what\never, and I got the idea that she had no engagement for the hour following.\nI could hear a noise as of water falling upon tin. She called my attention\nto it after she had been in the room a few minutes and said a man was\ncoming to fix the faucet in the bathroom, that the water had been running all\nthe morning and made her nervous, as she feared an overflow. Said she\nhoped the man would not disturb us. She went out to look at the running\nwater, saying she was afraid it would overflow, and it was 9.50 when we went\ninto the seance-room. She did not get on well, the noise troubled her, said\nit made her nervous. She went out again, but apparently did nothing to\ndeaden the sound, though a sponge or cloth would have stopped it. The\nnoise of washing dishes also disturbed her, and she left the room again to\nspeak to the girl and see that the door into the kitchen was closed.\nBy this time it must have been about ten o'clock. She now spoke for the\nfirst time of another sitter who was coming at 10.30, a business man who\ncouldn't afford to lose any time. She said she would leave a note for him ; that\nshe sometimes had to do this when the previous sitter was late, as though\ntrying to lay the blame on me. She put a note on the sofa in the parlour\nand came back and tried again, but without success. Then she asked me if I\nwould wait and let her try first with the gentleman who was coming, saying\nif she could succeed with him she probably could with me afterwards. I\nagreed to this, and we went into the parlour, the note being removed. She\ndidn't stop in the parlour, but went off through the hall and talked with the\ngirl, leaving the hall door open. At first I could not hear what was said, then\nMrs. Piper spoke up quite loudly, so I could hear every word. It's some\nthing about the faucet. The leather is worn or something like that. Soon\nthe gentleman came, and she explained the situation and took him into the\nseance-room, leaving me in the parlour. She came back and said if she\nsucceeded in going into the trance she would ask Phinuit what the trouble\nwas before, if it was anything about me, though she was sure that was not it.\nShe had no better success than before and soon gave it up, the gentleman\nleaving immediately. She asked if I wished to make another engagement.\n1 said I could not then, and went away.\nMr. Brown writes on June 20th, 1888 :\u2014\nI wrote to my wife, who is away (without giving any details of my\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance.\nsittings), and asked her to send me a statement of what Mrs. Piper told her\nabout ourselves and the boys, in order to compare it with what I got. Ill\nreply she sends me a full account of her sitting, which she says was already\nnearly written. This I include also. [I do not know whether I received this\nor not, but I cannot find it among my documents.\u2014R. H.]\nIn regard to Mrs. Piper, I have the secret of her power. That is, I have\na good deal of confidence that such is the case, and am anxious to have my\ntheory tested in such a manner as to be either proved true or shown to be\nfalse. I think she proceeds by guesswork, in which she is materially assisted\nby the conversation of the sitters, this conversation being to a considerable\nextent guided and controlled by herself. So far as pure guesswork goes, do\nnot think she shows any great skill, that there are others who can do this\nmuch more scientifically and successfully, and that her skill lies chiefly in\ngetting the help of the sitter, who points out the way she is to travel in a\nmaimer analogous to that in which Bishop's subjects lead him to the hidden\narticles.\nWhen Mrs. Brown told me about her sitting I resolved that when I\nsat the Doctor should get no information from me as to the truth or\nfalsity of what he told me. This I pretty consistently carried out, though I\nasked many questions and was as frank and open as possible. Now, what\nwas the result ? Leaving out of account such statements as these : that dogs\nliked me, that I don't make as many intimate friends as some, but am a\ngood fellow all the same, and that one of my boys has had a bad cold, she\ntold me absolutely nothing that is true except the following facts : My name\nin full, John Fenner Brown ; my wife's first name, Fannie ; that we have\ntwo children, the elder being a boy.\nYou will remember that when we were in your room, May 9th (it is\nreferred to in Mrs. B.'s report), Mrs. Piper came in. The sitting with\nMrs. Brown had just taken place. Mrs. Piper would naturally guess who I\nwas, and the fact of finding us there would make her expect a call from me\nand be on the look out for it. Referring to Mrs. B.'s report, we find Dr.\nPhinuit's knowledge at the conclusion of this sitting, and in relation to the\nabove-mentioned facts, to be as follows : My name in full, John Fenner\nBrown ; my wife's first name Fannie ; that we have two boys ; the name of\nthe younger\u2014the correspondence is startling.\nWhat I wrote to my wife was that I had had a sitting with Mrs. Piper\nand that she had told me nothing except what she already knew or could\nguess. This can be verified, for Mrs. B. will have the letter. I also said I\nwas going to give the medium a surprise party the following morning (June\n12th), and that I would not be received with open arms. It certainly turned\nout as I anticipated. Quelling all suspicion about the leaky faucet, the fact\nremains that Mrs. Piper wanted to get rid of me. She showed it just as\nplainly as did the slate-writer. In fact, her manner tallied exactly with\nthat of the other mediums I have met. They all do fairly well for me at first\n(doesn't this go to show that there is no trouble with me ?) and then their\npowers are on the wane. ,\nSitting with Mrs. Piper, October 20th, 1888.\nI rang the bell at 9.25. Mrs. Piper, I am quite sure, answered the call.\n\f90 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nI said, \" I had an appointment foi'9.30,\" and was told to come up. A girl\nmet me at the door upstairs. Mrs. P. came in almost immediately. Her\ngreeting was by no means cordial, and she seemed to be ill at ease, though\ntrying hard, and with pretty good success, to conceal her embarrassment.\nShe asked if Mr. Hodgson made the appointment for me, and if 1 had not\nhad one sitting and failed a second time owing to her nervousness. I\nanswered \" Yes \" to these questions, which were evidently not asked for the\npurpose of getting information.\nSoon she commenced talking about people who mistrusted her, who.\nhad no faith in the manifestations. Said they made her nervous, and she\nwished they wouldn't come ; that she was foolish to mind it so, but she\ncouldn't help it, she was so very sensitive. She talked in this strain for some\ntime, there being nothing personal in her remarks, except by inference. At\nlength I said: \"You don't think I mistrust you, do you?\" \"Yes,\" she\nreplied, \" I know you do.\" Then she spoke freely, said I had no faith in her\nor the manifestations, and that I thought she did not wish to sit for me. She\nspoke of the leaking faucet mentioned in my last report. Said that when she\ntold me of it I showed by my looks that I did not believe it. I said I did\nnot doubt the faucet leaked. \" Yes,\" she replied, \"but you thought it was\na pretext to get rid of you.\" I could not deny this, nor would it have been\nof any use to have done so, for she evidently knew how I felt about it. She\nsaid it was a misfortune to be a medium, and spoke in general terms of the\ninsults to which she had been subjected. It did not occur to me to ask if\nshe thought I had misused her in any way, but I did ask if she thought\nI had attempted to mislead Dr. Phinuit. She did not give a direct\nanswer, but appeared to think that perhaps I had done so. I assured\nher that such was not the case, and that I did not think there was anything\nin my attitude that ought to prevent a satisfactory sitting. Ever since she\nfirst spoke of people who mistrusted her she had been in a very nervous and\nexcited condition. But sho gradually became calmer. She said she was\nafraid I would not like to have her talk so freely, but she was so very sensi\ntive she couldn't stand it, and must speak out to relieve herself. I told her\nthat was right, she couldn't talk any too freely to suit me.\nAbout 9.55 she announced that she was ready, acting as though she hated\nto sit, but as though for some reason, not altogether apjHtrent, she must do\nso, and was resigned to the inevitable. She took my hands pretty soon after\nwo were seated, and almost immediately I became aware that she was going\ninto the trance. Her nervousness seemed to be all gone, and it took but a\nvery short time.\nDr. Phinuit called me by name, John, and said he had talked with my\nfriends who had passed over and had learned a good deal about me. Three\nor four of my friends were present\u2014 a grandfather, a brother, and an uncle.\nThe name Edward was given (see account of first sitting) and I was asked if\nthat was the name of the brother. I said, Not exactly. This was as near as\nthe Doctor could get it, and he asked me what the name was. I said, Edgar.\nThen Phinuit saw an elderly man with \" fhese \" (stroking my beard) on his\nface. He had trouble with his stomach, had dyspepsia. [True.] I asked\nwho he was. P. : My father. B. : Living or dead ? P. : Living. B. : What\nis his middle name ? The Doctor could not tell. I was told to ask questions\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 91\nif I wished to, and I said : ' ' Tell me about my brothers and sisters, if I\nhave any,\" and intimating more by my tones than by what was said, that 1\nhad brothers but no sisters. (This I did inadvertently. Throughout the\nsitting I answered all the Doctor's questions and asked a good many myself,\nbut was in general careful not to make my questions leading, or no more so\nthan could be helped.) Phinuit laughed and said he wasn't going to tell me\nabout what I hadn't, but about what I had. And I said, \"Tell me about my\nbrothers, then.\" He replied that there were five of us, four living and one\ndead, which is correct. I had already in effect admitted that I had brothers\nand a brother not living, but, so far as I am aware, this is all that could be\ngathered from what I had said.\nThe medium rubbed her hands over mine, felt of my fingers, and then the\nDoctor said he saw wheels, wheels all over me. I waited a moment to see\nwhat was coming, but as usual during this sitting nothing came until I asked\nfor it. I said, \" What kind of wheels ? \" And then, in a moment : \" Largo\nones or small ones ? \" The answer was : \" Oh, big ones, great big ones, with\ncrooked things in them. What you call them ? Spokes?\" I asked what they\nwere used for. The Doctor said for machinery, but didn't seem to know for\nwhat kind of machinery until I asked the direct question, and then he said,\nhesitatingly at first, then with confidence, \"Steam engines.\" Then he saw an\noffice where writing was being done ; the elderly man was there and I was\nthere. Business was to be good for the next year and I need not worry about\nthat account that had been troubling me\u2014that would come out all right. The\nnames Fannie and Mira (Meera) (see Mrs. B.'s report of her sitting) were\ngiven. Fannie was the mother of my boys. There was some difficulty in\nfinding out who Mira was, and it was finally given up after some apparent\nguesses had been made.\nI was told to ask questions if I wished, and I said, \"Who is Horace\nBrown?\" The answer came immediately, \"He is your uncle\"\u2014the uncle\nwho was there, and whose presence I had forgotten till thus reminded of it.\nI said, \" How about his son?\" What followed I consider quite interesting\nand remarkable, though by no means a good test of the alleged supernormal\npower. So far as I am aware the medium knew nothing about Horace Brown\nor his son, certainly they had never been mentioned by me. My question\nwould afford a professional guesser the opportunity to get in some pretty\ngood work, but there was no appearance of guesswork. Nothing was said to\ndraw me out in the slightest degree\u2014unless it was to make me ask questions.\nThe replies were not given in a hesitating and half-questioning tone, so that\nI could deny or correct, or the speaker readily change them if occasion\nrequired ; they were plumped out in the most positive and decided manner,\nand, so far as my knowledge extends, with but one partial exception, were\nexactly right.\nMy List question was answered like this : \"Oh, he's alive.\" Then, without\nanything being said by me, it was added that he left home some time ago.\nAfterwards it was said a good many years ago, though this may have come\nfrom me; that he had been about a good deal and had been at sea. This also\n(and what follows, unless otherwise stated) without help from me. That when\nhe left home he was single, but now was married and living in Southern\nCalifornia. I asked why he left home. Because he was uneasy and of a\n\f92 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nroving disposition. Why didn't he write to his folks ? There was no\nparticular reason ; it never occurred to him to do so. Phinuit said he\ncouldn't tell just where in Southern California he was (this without\nquestioning by me), but that he could find out. I told him to do so. Said\nhe couldn't then, I would have to come again for that. (Finessing ?) He\n.gave the name of the son as Charles (in reply to my question) and said I\nwould hear from him soon, within a year, I think. The best way to get a\ngood sitting, Phinuit said, was to have him talk with my departed friends\nand then see me within three or four days.\nThere was nothing further of interest, nor which I can recall. Phinuit\nsaid if I had anything more to ask about I must do it soon, but I told him\nthere was nothing more, bade him good-bye, and he took his departure.\nWhen the medium was coming to, she saw snakes on my hands and kindly\npulled them off. She complained of being pricked on the hand, said, \"Don't\nprick me so,\" or something like that, and after she was entirely herself asked\nme two or three times if I had pricked her. I assured her that I had not.\nShe asked if I got anything, and I told her she did very well, much better\nthan she did the first thus. This seemed to please her greatly. As I was\ngoing out, I said, \"You have done so well to-day, if I should come again, you\nwouldn't feel towards me as you have this time, would you ? \" She shrugged\nher shoulders, said, \"I don't know,\" and mumbled something further which I\ncould not catch.\nJohn F. Brown.\n14. Mr. \"Q.\" December 29th, 1888.\nThis sitting was a failure. At the close of it Phinuit said that he thought\nTie had been getting the influence of the previous sitter, and was anxious to\ntry another sitting. We arranged for another sitting for the following day,\nbut Mrs. Piper's illness then prevented our having it, and Mr. \"Q.\" was\nunable to stay in Boston any longer. Mr. \" Q.' writes on September 11th,\n1890.\u2014 \"I return the notes of the conversation with Mrs. Piper. At the\ntime of the sitting my general impression was unfavourable ; the answers,\nat any rate, were irrelevant and inaccurate in everything except as to those\nwhich might have been inferences from my personal appearance.\"\n15. Mr. Robertson James. March 6th, 1889.\n5, Boylston-place, March 6th, 1889. 1p.m.\nMr. Robertson James has just called here on return from a sitting with\nMrs. P., during which he was informed by Mrs. P.\u2014entranced\u2014that \"Aunt\nKate \" had died about 2 or 2.30 in the morning. Aunt Kate was also\nreferred to as Mrs. Walsh.\nMre. Walsh has been ill for some time and has been expected during the\nlast few days to die at any hour. This is written before any despatch has\nbeen received informing of the death, in presence of the following :\u2014\nRichard Hodgson.\nWm. James.\nRobertson James.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance.\nOn reaching home an hour later I found a telegram as follows :\u2014\" Aunt\nKate passed away a few minutes after midnight. \u2014E.

James.\nJuly, 1890.\nIt may be worth while to add that early at this sitting I inquired, \" How\nis Aunt Kate?\" The reply was, \" She is poorly. \" This reply disappointed\nme, from its baldness. Nothing more was said about Aunt Kate till towards\nthe close of the sitting, when I again said, ' ' Can you tell me nothing more\nabout Aunt Kate ? \" The medium suddenly threw back her head and said\nin a startled way, \" Why, Aunt Kate's here. All around me I hear voices\nsaying, 'Aunt Kate has come.'\" Then followed the announcement that\nshe had died very early that morning, and on being pressed to give the time,,\nshortly after two was named.\nA. H. J.\n16. R. Hodgson. November 7th, 1889.\n[From a letter written to Professor W. James on the day of the sitting.]\nMrs. D. and I had sitting to-day at Arlington Heights, and the usurpa\ntion by \" Kate Walsh \" was extraordinary. She (Mrs. Piper) had got hold\nof my hands, and I had to make a few fragmentary notes afterwards of the\nremarks, themselves fragmentary, which she made. The personality seemed\nvery intense, and spoke in effortful whispers.\n\" William\u2014William\u2014God bless you.\" (Who are you?) \u2014 \"Kate-\nWalsh \"\u2014(I know you.) \" Help me\u2014help me\u2014 \" [Taking my right hand\nwith her right, and passing it to her left and making me take hold of her\nleft hand.] \" That hand's dead\u2014dead\u2014this one's alive \" [i.e., the right]\u2014\n\" help me.\" The left hand appeared to be at a decidedly lower temperature\nthan the right. It was cooler than either of my hands, while the right hand'\nwas warmer than either of my hands.\n\" I'm alive\u2014I'm alive\u2014Albert's coming over soon.

You had fish for breakfast on the second day, didn't you ? \" (I don't\nremember very well.) \"And the tea\u2014who was it spilt the cup of tea ?

But that was the sort of\nthing, and nothing d la mode Phinuit at all. It was the most strikingly\npersonal thing I have seen. I recollect having fish for some meal, and recall\nthat some remarks were made about it at the time. I recall very clearly that\nMrs. Walsh made tea more than once for my special benefit, and I seem to\nremember something about the spilling of a cup of tea, but cannot be sure.\nI don't know whether my room was called corner or not. It was an end\nroom, but was in front of the house. There was a little stumbling over the\nname, which appeared to be Albert. I don't recall anything about the\nblancmange or cream stuff, but I have little taste for that kind of dish.\nConcerning sitting of November 7th and \"Kate Walsh\" Control.\nProfessor James says, in letter of November 10th, 1889 :\u2014.\n\"The 'Kate Walsh' freak is very interesting. The first mention of her\nby Phinuit was when she was living, three years or more ago, when she had\nwritten to my wife imploring her not to sit for development. Phinuit knew\nthis in some incomprehensible way. A year later [in a sitting] with Margaret\nOibbens [sister of Mrs. James], I present, Phinuit alluded jocosely to this\nfear of here again, and made some derisive remarks about her unhappy\nmarriage, calling her an ' old crank, ' &c. Her death was announced last\nspring, as you remember. In September, sitting with me and my wife, Mrs.\nPiper was suddenly ' controlled ' by her spirit, who spoke directly with\nmuch impressiveness of manner, and great similarity of temperament to\nherself. Platitudes. She said Henry Wyckoff had experienced a change,\nand that Albert was coming over soon ; nothing definite about either. Queer\nbusiness ! \"\n[From Miss E. R. Walsh.]\n258, Fourth Avenue, December 1st, 1889.\nMy Dear William,\u2014In reply to the questions you ask apropos of Mr.\nHodgson's \"sitting\":\nPoor Aunt Kate's right side was the one affected by the paralysis. She\nhad the use of her left hand and arm until near the end. I have no recol\nlection of hearing of any such incidents as the \"spilling of tea,\" ifcc. ; but I\nthought if anything of the kind had occurred, Margaret, in Forty-fourth-\nstreet, would be likely to remember it, so, when I was there to-day to ask\nafter Cousin H. [Henry Wyckoff], I questioned M., but with absolutely no\nconfirmatory result.\nThe partial coincidence of the following facts with the statements made\nto you and your wife comes a little nearer to the mark. The last week in\nAugust Cousin Henry did have a very severe convulsion, lasting many\nhours, from which the doctors thought he could hardly rally. An hour\nbefore, one of the nurses, in helping move him, knocked under accident\nally the folding support on one side of the cot on which he lay, and the\npoor man slipped almost to the floor. He did not really fall, and was not\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 95\nat all injured, but the nervous shock brought on the convulsion. Wonderful\nto say, he came out of it entirely, and for several days after his brain seemed\nmuch more active ; he made constant and excited efforts to speak, and it\nseemed as though some great change might take place in his condition.\nThis happened in Mrs. Griffitt's stay with him. By the time we came to\nForty-fourth-street, in September, he had subsided to a great extent, and\nthen, in a week or two more, began a gradual failure, which has been going\non by the slowest degrees ever since. Now he can't even lift what they call\nhis \"good hand\" outside the bed covering without help. They think,\nhowever, he may live months as he is. What a death in life ! Poor man, to\nhave such an end to his harmless life. Again, Albert did intermit his visits\nfor seven weeks or more, from the middle of August to early in October,\nbeing detained at home by a severe attack of bronchitis, and when he first\nreappeared one of the nurses said he looked more like dying than his\nuncle. Since then, however, he has quite recovered, and starts for\nCalifornia on the 18th.\nElizabeth Robertson Walsh.\n17. Fravlein Veith. September 22nd, 1889.\nThis sitting was held at the summer residence of Professor James\nin the White Mountains, Friiulein Veith being a governess in the\nfamily of Professor James, and Mrs. Piper had been several days in the\nhouse. Miss Gibbens and R. Hodgson were also present at the sitting,\nthe latter taking notes.\nPhinuit wrongly mentioned the sitter's father as being \"in spirit.\" To\nthe sitter's inquiry about her sisters he gave the names Mary [correct] and\nMarna [Martha ?], and said that there were two others [correct], who were\nafterwards named as Edith and Janet [instead of Ida and Anna]. The\nname Edith was written as that of a sister who died, and the throat was\nindicated as cause of death. Ida died of croup. She was said to have a\nbrother in spirit, afterwards that Frith was brother, then that she had two\nbrothers, the second one also dead. She had two brothers deceased named\nFritz and Julius. Later on the name Juli\u2014Julus was given without any\nfurther statement about it. Some reference was made to a \" father's\nbrother,\" as an old gentleman who left some property unsettled, and who\nbad a son, and afterwards to an uncle Charles. The statement made about\nthe \" father's brother \" would have fitted an intimace friend of the sitter's\nfather, named Karl. Joseph was correctly described as uncle, and \" full of\nfun.\" The name Katrine, given by Phinuit early in the sitting, was later\non said to be Adeline, \" in the body\" and \"across the water.\" The sitter\nbad a special friend named Adelheid, who was much in the house in\nGermany. The only other name given was Emmsline, the sitter's name\nbeing Emilie. Phinuit made further two or three mistakes about incidents,\nand seemed much confused by the names, saying that the sitter's friends\nwere talking German to him, and he could not understand them. Following\nthe sitter's remark that she had \"a sore eye,\" Phinuit said, \"There's a\n\f9G Mr. It. Hodgson.\nlittle poison there. Something stung you there.\" This circumstance was\nknown previously to Mrs. Piper.\nTowards the close of the sitting Professor James comes in behind Mrs.\nP. and says, \"Mrs. Piper, raise your left arm.\" Repeated. \" Raise your\nright arm,\" &c., iStc. Professor James then seizes the right arm of Mrs. P.\nand moves it slightly, with effect that Dr. P. \"calls after the toucher,\"\nsaying, \" Who the devil is it touching me 1 \"\n18. Mr. \" A. r.,\" Boston.\nTo Professor W. James.\nJune 13th, 1886.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014I have this evening received your favour dated the\n11th.\nI have made only two visits to Mrs. Piper. I have had two other\nappointments, but in the one case I was too ill to attend, and in the other\nthe weather was rainy, and therefore \"the conditions\" (whatever that may\nsignify) were unfavourable.\nAt the first interview several remarkable phenomena occurred.\nAlthough I was introduced by another name, my true name was early\ngiven and some incidents of my life stated, which by no conceivable way\ncould have been known to the medium, even if she had known who I was.\nThe persons seeking communication with me were described by name and\nby person, with much particularity, and the inquiries made were such a*\nthey would have made if in conscious communication with me. I was told\nthat I was about to make a journey to a distant part of the country, which I\nhad no intention to make, and which, indeed, had never been in my\nmind, but which soon afterwards it became necessary for me to make, and\nI did make it. One thing prominent at this interview and very unusual,\nso far as I know, was the concurrent descriptions of persons in life and in\nthe other world and their relations to each other. For example : It was\nsaid to me that there was an elderly gentleman in the spirit-world, who\nwas very desirous of speaking with me, and a full description of his person\nand of his occupation, while in this life, was given, also a like description\nof an elderly lady, as to her person, and what she was at that moment\ndoing. After a moment it was said that the lady is in the flesh, and that\nthe gentleman was her husband, and in the spirit-world, and that he\nwished me to give his love to her. A moment later I was told that I am\nhis son-in-law, which is correct, as all of the other circumstances were.\nAt this first interview I do not remember that there was one thing-\nincorrect, but some statements were more vague than others, and this\nseemed not only to be known but to be accounted for in this way, namely,\nthat the communicators had less power with the medium than would be\nthe case after some further experience, but that there would be an increase\nof power with a repetition of attempts.\nThe second interview was, on the whole, less satisfactory. The medium\nseemed less composed, there was more of her own personality in the inter\nview, and a certain something akin to anxiety to make it a success.

Much\nconversation similar to that of the first interview was had, some things of a\npurely private nature were correctly told ; among others the pet name in\nGerman by which I was accustomed to address my wife when living and we\nwere alone together. But most of the incidents of this second interview\nwere semi-psychical or circumstantial, rather than supernal or spiritual.\nThere was little that was erroneous, though there was some, but it was for\nthe most [part ?] secondary and unimportant. . . .

I will say, how\never, that I went there totally unknown to her, and the names she called and\nthe facts she spoke of, known only to myself and those who are no longer\nhere, astonished me beyond measure, for I had never before visited a medium\nor seen anything of the kind. Some time I should like to talk with you\nabout it.\u2014Very truly yours,\nE. D.

Mr. Barrett Wendell, Boston, Mass.\n18, Gray's, May 26M [1886].\nDear Mr. Jame.*,\u2014My sitting with Mrs. Piper was rather interesting.\nIn the course of it, I had what purported to be communications from a\nnumber of people, viz., 1, S. [surname correctly given] ; 2, my uncle G.\n[Christian name correctly given]; 3, \"Ellie,\"whom I half identified; 4,\nE. [surname correctly given], who bade me say that he meant to com\nmunicate with you before long; 5, one Alvin Clark, who bade me \"thank\nDr. Everett for the beautiful prayer he made at my funeral.\"\nCertain curious circumstances attended one or two of the communications,\nand Mrs. Piper's recovery from the trance state was, perhaps, the most\nshocking sight I ever witnessed.\nI have no question of her honesty ; and not a shadow of belief in anything\nsupernatural. Mind-reading she undoubtedly accomplished to some extent.\nBy the way, is not this mind-reading a rudimentary survival of the methods\nof communication of lower animals\u2014birds, fishes, horses, &c., &c, much\ndimmed in ordinary men by the\u2014in every sense\u2014improved development of\ncommunication by language ?\nBarrett Wendell.\nii\n\f\u2022IS Alr. R. Hodgson.\nMr. Wendell adtU, in a letter of June 21st, 1890 :\u2014\nNeither C. C. Everett nor William Everett\u2014the only \"Dr. Everett\" I\nknow anything about -had ever made a prayer at any Alvin Clark's funeral,\nor at least they personally assured me that they had not. Alvin Clark, the\nwell-known manufacturer of telescopic lenses, was still alive at the time of\nmy sitting, which I think was in 1886 ; it could not have been later.\nThe \"curious circumstances\" mentioned in my second paragraph were\nthese. During the sitting Mrs. Piper was constantly moving, sometimes\nwrithing, and frequently uttering inarticulate sounds. In her writhing she\nfrequently clutched her throat with both hands ; this reminded me of the\ncurious affection of the throat\u2014a very large external swelling\u2014of which my\nfriend E. (4) had died within a few weeks. Thus he came into my head ;\nwithin a half hour or so she had tolerably described and distinctly named\nhim. A similar phenomenon preceded the naming of my uncle (2) ; her\ninarticulate utterances took a form that reminded me strongly of the gasping\nwhich I had heard him utter during the interval of nearly a day which\nelapsed between a stroke of apoplexy and his death. Once in my head, sho\nnamed him before long.\n22. Mr. X. (A Hl,\u00ablet,t of mine, W. .1.) May llffc, 1889.\nThis sitting was practically a complete failure.\n23. C. W. F., M.J). Protuknet, R. I., May 17th, 1889.\nProfessor Wm. James.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014As I am interested, as an outsider, in the work of the\nS.P.R., and have wtlled its attention, through Mr. Hodgson, to a few easea\nof interest, I wish to ask you if any endeavour has been made to prove the\nidentity of Mrs. Piper's \"control\"\u2014Dr. Phinuit ? Mr. Hodgson kindly\narranged a seance for me with her in January, and I have had two others\nsince that date. All have been interesting, and rather force me to believe\nthat Dr. P. is not a fictitious personage. Von Hartmann says, \" If the spirits\n.-ire unable to act without a living medium, if they have need of its un\nconscious will for their mediation, we may as well content ourselves with\nthis unconscious will as a cause.\" 1 fail to be satisfied with this hypothesis,\nbecause some interesting disclosures have come from mediums not in an\nunconscious state.\nDr. P. has partially forgotten his French, so far as speaking it goes, yet\nI am convinced that he understands all I say in that language, and that\nMrs. I', does not, from my tests of her capacity, and she impresses me as\nbeing a truly honest woman.\nI will here give some of my questions to Dr. P. and his replies :\u2014y. ;\n' ' What medical men were prominent in Paris in your time ? \" A . : \" Bouvier\nand Dupuytren, who was at Hotel Dieu.\" (Bouvier died in 1827, Dupuytren\nin 1835.) Q. : \"Was D. alive when you 'passed out'?\" A.: \"No, he\npassed out before me ; I passed out twenty or thirty years ago.\" y. :\n\" How long do you think I shall live ? \" (He had pretty well described my\nphysical condition.) He answered this question by counting in French on\nthe medium's fingers to eleeen. Q. : \" What influence has my mind on what\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 90\nyou tell me 1\" A . : ' f 1 get nothing from your mind ; I can't read your mind\n.'tny more than I can see through a stone wall.\" He added that he saw\nobjectively the persons of whom he spoke to me, and that they conveyed to\nhim the messages given. Q. : \" Have you any relatives living in Marseilles ? \"\nA. ; \" I had a brother who died there two or three years ago.''\nThe names of several persons he called up he spelt in French, as Robert,\nnot being able, seemingly, to pronounce them well in English. He mentioned\nby name my three deceased sisters, and dwelt at much length on my brother\nGeorge ; our strong attachment, our travels in Europe, of his being near me\n:x great deal, of our future reunion, &c., &c Q. : \" Will you ask George to\ngive me some incident in his life known only to ourselves ? \" Dr. P. then\n:illuded to the loss of our luggage, &c, in Europe. (A train went off without\nus, in which were our coats, luggage, &c.)\n. . . \" Robert and Clara are very grateful to you for your good\ncare of their son, your nephew Georgie ; you and Georgie will surely go to\nEurope together after your mother's decease.\" This was spontaneously given,\nand much was added regarding this nephew. Being quite curious as to the\nresult of a sdance I desired my nephew to have before my last one, he got a\nfriend to arrange one, so that his name should not appear. At this seance of\nmy nephew the first names given were those of his father and mother, but no\nimpression of any weight was made upon his mind by the seance, and he\nutterly discarded the spiritual hypothesis. In drawing out of him what little\nI could, I found he asked his father to give him, the son, his exact age. He\nasked Dr. P. how his uncle (myself) was. A. : \"Oh, C. W., he has\n.\" (Correct.) \" He plays on the violin.\" (Correct.) At my seance\nsubsequent to this Dr. P. spontaneously said : \"Your nephew George has\nbeen here.\" I said, he is sceptical about your being a spirit. Reply: \"No\nmatter how smart George is, he will have to learn that there is another life.\"\n(My nephew, who is thoroughly absorbed in his work as professor at the\nM. I.T., had said to me that he didn't want another life.)\nAt my first seance Dr. P. said : \"Your friend William is here, and ho\naddressed you as C. W. (This,\" said Dr. P., \"is the way you sign your\nname), and William is determined to give you his whole name before I go\nout.\" As Mrs. P. began to come out of the trance, \" Pabodie \" was spoken\nwith great force, and Mrs. P. gave a start, saying, \" Somebody spoke right\nin my ear.\" I thought she seemed to think I had done so. At my third\nseance Dr. P. said spontaneously : \" William Pabodie sends his love to you,\nand says he has suffered greatly over here from remorse of conscience ; and\nthat, had he his life to live over, he would not do what he did.\" (He com\nmitted suicide in 1870.) . . .\nDr. P. said : \" Many people think I am the medium ; that is all bosh.\"\n<}.: \"Do you see George ?\" (Brother.) A.: \"Yes.\" Q. : \" How does ho\nlook ? \" A. : \" He has dark hair, and looks younger than you.\" (He had\nnearly black hair, and died at forty-two, and I am nearly sixty-one.) Q. :\n\" Flow do you get what you tell me about myself ; my length of life, my going\nt-i Europe, &c. ?\" A.: \"I get it from your astral light.\" . . . Ho\nseemed to know about my mother's condition, and spoke of it spontaneously.\nI then asked, \"Can you tell me how long she may live i \" A. : \" I cannot,\ns'.-c that she will live a year or two longer.\" . . . The sense of taste I\n1! 'I\n\f100 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nfound to be not in the tongue, but on the forehead. [See p. 4.] Q. : \" Do\nyou see me now distinctly?\" A.: \"I see more your ethereal organism.\"\nQ. : \" Can you tell me who that lady was whose revenant I saw some years\nago in my own house 1\" A. : \" That was your sister Clara. Clara was\noriginally named Clarissa, and it was afterwards changed.\" (Correct.) The\ndoctor has emphasised my own mediumistic power at each seance, and has\nsaid that I would surely write. \" Get a planchette, and I will come to your\nown house as a test. \"\nC. W. F.\n24. Iter. M. J. Savage. 1885-0.\n[The Rev. M. J. Savage has long been widely known in the United\nStates, both as a minister and as an investigator of \" Spiritualism.\"]\nBoston, June 26th, 1890.\nDuring the winter of 1885-0, I had my first sitting with Mrs. Piper. She\nwas then on Pinckney-street, in this city.\nImmediately on becoming entranced, her control, Dr. Phinuit, said there\nwere many spirit friends present. Among them ho said was an old man,\nwhom he described, but only in a general way. Then he said, \" He is your\nfather, and he calls you Judson.\" Attention was also called to the fact that\nhe had a peculiar bare spot on his head, and Mrs. Piper put her hand on the\ncorresponding place on her own head.\nNow for the facts that give these two apparently simple points whatever\nsignificance they possess. My father had died during the preceding summer,\naged ninety years and six months. He had never lived in Boston, and Mrs.\nPiper, I am quite sure, had never seen him nor been in any way interested\nin him. He wasn't at all bald, but when quite young had been burned ; so\nthat there was a bare spot on the right side of the top of his head, perhaps\nan inch wide and three inches long, running from the forehead back towards\nthe crown. This he covered by combing his hair over it. This was the\nspot that Mrs. Piper indicated. Now as to the name by which he addressed\nme : I was given the middle name, Judson, at the request of a half-sister,\nmy father's daughter, who died soon after I was born. Out of tenderness\nfor her memory (as I always supposed) father always used, when I was a\nboy, to call me Judson, though all the rest of the family called me by my\nfirst name, Minot. In his later life father also got to calling me by my first\nname. No one, therefore, had called me by my second name for many\nyears. I was therefore naturally struck and surprised by suddenly hearing\none who claimed to be my father giving me once more my old boyhood name.\nI was not consciously thinking of either of these things ; and I am con\nvinced that Mrs. Piper couldn't have known anything about them.\nDuring this same sitting Mrs. Piper's control also said, \"Here is some\nbody who says his name is John. He was your brother. No, not your own\nbrother; your half-brother.\" Then, pressing her hand on the base of her\nbrain, she moaned, as she swayed to and fro. Then she continued, \"He\nsays it was so hard to die away off there all alone ! How he did want to see\nmother ! \" She went on to explain that he died from a fall, striking the\nback of his head. Her whole account of this was realistic in the extreme.\n\fObservations of CerUtin Phenomena of Trance. 101\nMy half-brother John, the son of my mother \u2014 for both father and\nmother had been twice married\u2014died several years previous to this sitting.\nWhile building a mill in Michigan he fell, striking the back of his head on a\npiece of timber. He was far from all friends ; and was a most tender lover\nof his mother. I was not thinking of him until told that he was present.\nMany other things occurred during the sitting. But I mention only\nthese, because, though simple, they are clear-cut and striking, and because I\n-see no way by which Mrs. Piper could ever have known them.\nM. J. Savage.\nP.S.\u2014I have had other sittings with Mrs. Piper. Most of the things told\nwere, however, too personal for publication. Nearly all are inexplicable on\nany theory that does not go at least as far as telepathy.\n25. Miss Gertrude Savage. October 23rd, 1888.\nBoston, October 23rd, 1888.\nI made an appointment for a sitting with Mrs. Piper, under an assumed\nname (that of ' ' Miss Margaret Brown \"), and giving the address of a friend\non Walnut Avenue.\nAt the time set I went to Mrs. Piper's ; she kept me waiting for a few\nmoments, on account of a severe headacho from which she was suffering.\nThen, on taking me into her parlour, she spoke with me for a moment or\ntwo. She said, \"Your homo is on Walnut Avenue; you must have had\niiuite a little walk over here?\" I replied, \"No, my home is not on\nWalnut Avenue ; I gave you an assumed name and a false address, to make\nthe sitting a better test.\" She said, \" Oh, well, that does not matter. I\nonly hope I can give you something satisfactory, for when my head aches so,\nit is rather apt not to be so successful.\" We then went into the darkened\nroom adjoining, and she took my hand in hers. Immediately her fingers\nbegan to twitch and then her whole body, and she groaned and ground her\nteeth, and constantly muttered, \"Oh, what's the matter? what is the\nmatter ? \"\nBefore entering the dark room, I had taken three locks of hair, each one\nenclosed in an envelope, and had placed one in the front of a book, one in\nthe back, and one in the middle. The one in the middle I knew was my\nmother's ; it was ouly a few hairs, taken by stealth, for she would not give\nher consent to my having them. The other two I had not looked at, and\nhad no idea to whom they belonged. They were sent me by a friend,\nalready enclosed in the little envelopes, and I was purposely ignorant con\ncerning them\u2014all to make the test more complete. It was on this errand,\nfor this friend, Mr. Fred Day, that I went to see Mrs. Piper.\nOn going into the trance state, Mrs. Piper's voice became guttural, harsh,\nand she spoke with a decided accent. Keeping my hand in hers, and\npressed against her forehead, she began instantly to speak, and she\ntalked with me incessantly for an hour. She said : \"I never talked\nwith you before, and you are very peculiar ; it is not easy for me to\ntell you anything about yourself personally, you are so queer. I do\nnot know who you are. I cannot get your name. My name is Dr.\nFinway. Can you understand me ? Sometimes people cannot, because\n\f102 Mr. It. Hodyxon.\nI speak with an accont.\" \"Oh, yes,\" I answered, \"I can understand\nyim perfectly. I want to give you a lock of hair for you to examine.\"\nI then gave into Mrs. Piper's hand the lock of hair from the envelope in the\nfront of the book\u2014not knowing myself whose it was. Immediately on\nreceiving it, \"Dr. Finway \" exclaimed. \"Fred! Oh yes, Fred, a young\nman, very thin, wears glasses, little board, great friend of yours. This\nFred- -1 never had his hair before, but the influence does not seem new !\n[I learn that Mr. Day had sat previously with Mrs. Piper.\u2014 R. H.]\nImogene\u2014who's Imogene ? \" \"I do not know,\" said I. \"Yes. Imogene,\na young lady, friend of Fred's ; influence very strong. Who is she f \" \" I\nam sure I do not know. I did not know he had a friend named Imogene. I\ndo not think he has.\" \"He has! Don't contradict me!\" exclaimed he.\nThen he resumed, \"This Fred is an only child, mother plump, a lovely-\nlady, but she is not long for your world. This Fred is going on a long\njourney, across the water, within a year or two. He has already taken two\nlong journeys, one across the water, one not ; hasn't he, now 1\" \"I am not\nsure,\" said I. \"Well, he has,\" replied he. \"You ask him. What I tell\nyou I htote \u2014I can see it all, and I only tell you facts, and you will find that\nthey are so.\"\nI then gave him the other unknown lock of hair, from the back of\nthe book. Immediately he exclaimed, \" LTgh ! This is crazy ! It makes\nmc sick!\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I cannot tell you anything about this,\nbecause the influence is so mixed ; it has been handled by too many people,\nand it was not cut off near the head, where the magnetism from the body\ncould permeate it ; I can't tell you about it.\" (It proved to have been the\nhair of Mr. Day's aunt Mary, who died within the year, and it has passed\nthrough several people's hands, and was cut off near the end of the hair.)\nThen I gave him the little lock of my mother's hair, from the centre of\nthe book. \" Ella, \" he cried, \" she is stingy enough with her hair ! \" \"This\nElla is very sweet dispositioned, very : but she is not at all well. She has\ntrouble with her head ; she has fearful bilious headaches, and they come\nfrom the weak state of the nerves of the stomach ; and her liver is, of\ncourse, disordered ; you tell her that I am a physician, and that 1 say for\nher to take hot douche baths : now remember ! She is, it seems to me, some\nrelation to you. Wait a moment\u2014 she is your mother. I think. Yes, she is\nyour mother. And she has mi, thus, troh, qnatre\u2014four children t wo girls\nand two boys. You have a brother who is oft', away from you, somewhere,\na little west of you ; he is very independent ; he is a strong influence in\nElla's life. And you have a younger brother, and a sister ; her name begins\nwith H\u20140\u2014 Hellen, I think it is. But here is an old lady here \u2014 in the\nspirit. She has only left the body within a month, and she is your grand\nmother. You, young lady, are a flirt ! \" \"No,\" said I, \"I am not.\" \"The\ndeevil you aren't. You fire .'\" cried he. \"You are flirty, because you do\nnot know ; you have not made up your mind ; you like your friends in\ngeneral, but no one of them in particular. I can see the picture of some of\nthem. There is Clifford -he is moody. And his brother Fred is cranky\nlike you ; he does not know his own mind. Then there is Chester ; he is\nout West making his fortune ; and he will make a big one, too. And who is\nBert ?\" \"I do not know,\" said I. \" Y'es, you do. He is a very good\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena, of Trance. 103\nfriend to you, very good, although he is not very demonstrative in his\nspeech.\" (I then knew he meant a young friend of mine, a Harvard man,\nwhom I call Herbert, usually.) Then he said, \" And there is this Fred ; he\nis a true friend to you : his last name is Day\u2014Fred Day ; and oh ! 1\ncan see books, papers, and pictures all about him : I think he must\ntake pictures himself for amusement.\n\" I suppose you think I cannot see you, but I can\u2014you have dark eyes\nand light hair. I always liked dark eyes and light hair\u2014now, what are you\nlaughing at ?\u2014and you will be married. But there is no hurry, not a bit\u2014\nand in the latter part of your life, you will not live here,\u2014it will be in some\nforeign country\u2014in England, I think. I can see you crossing the water\nwith a middle-aged lady and a young man. Your life, so far, has been\nrlther even, not eventful ; but it will be full of action, later on. But you\nare so peculiar ; and this Fred is so peculiar ; you tell your father that he\nwill, within a year, realise something from some money he invested out\nWest, about two years ago ; you tell him I said so, and I fcnoir. And you\ntell Ella that she will be better in a few years if she takes care of herself ;\nshe is a little over forty now, and she is often, on the street, even, taken\nwith dizziness, and with darkness before her eyes : it all comes from the\nweak state of her nerves. And now I am getting tired. Is there anything\nyou want to ask me ? I will tell you if I can. I cannot tell you even your\nname. I do not know : I cannot seem to get your influence separlte from\nthe others\u2014Fred, and Ella, and all. If you will come some time without\nany locks of hair, I will see how it will be then.\"\nMrs. Piper then came out of the trance, with a face drawn and haggard,\nand with a dazed look in her eyes. \" Who are you ? \" she said. \"I do not\nknow who you are, do I ?\" I said, \"No, but I will tell you now. I am\nGertrude Savage ; you have met my father, I think.\" She was delighted to\nknow me, and who I was, and asked if she had told me anything satisfac\ntory. She was very glad when I told her she had.\nEverything she told me when in the trance was true as to fact : the\nprophecies remain to bo verified. The \"Imogene, \" so insisted upon, was\nimmediately verified by Mr. Day, as his old friend, Miss Imogene Gurney,\nwho3e first name I had forgotten. The lock of hair was his own\u2014and\neverything she said in connection with it was true.\nDuring the sitting Dr. Finway talked with me a little in French, but 1\nassured him I had forgotten my French. \"Oh,\" he said, and laughed. \"I\nsuppose je lte saU pai is all you can say ?\" And one thing further : He\ninsisted upon it that I must either play or embroider or draw, or do some\nthing with my fingers. \"No,\" said I; \" my accomplishments are highly\npractical. \" \" Well, I set; notes of music, anyway,\" said he. \" What do you\ndo?\" \" I write shorthand. \" \"Why didn't you say so before 1 That's it.\nShorthand looks like music notas. You do not print it afterwards, though :\nyou are not a regular stenographer ; you just do it for some friend, to help\nhim, I think.\"\nAll of which, as well as all of the whole interview, was perfectly true.\nGertrude Savagk.\nHr\u00ablncsdaij, October 24\/A, 1888.\n\f104 Mr. R.

J. Savage.\n2ti. Rev. W. II. Savage. Sitting with Mrs. Piper, Hotel Humboldt, Holborn-\nstreet, Boxbury, December 28th, 1888, at 12.30 p.m.\nConcerning the two following records of sittings in connection with\nthe Rev. M. J. Savage, see my remarks, pp. 34-37.\nAfter several remarkable sayings, she suddenly said, \"Ah! Here is\nsomebody from outside\u2014he says his name is Robert West. He wants to send\na message to your brother.\" Then, after a moment, \"I wrote an\u2014he is\nwriting it and I am reading for you\u2014an AR\u2014TI\u2014article A\u2014G\u2014A against his\n\\V\u2014work in the AD\u2014V\u2014Advance. What the dickens is the Advance ? \"\n1 said, \" It is a paper. \" Then she continued, \"I thought he was wrong,\nbut\u2014he was\u2014right, and I repent, he was right, I want you to tell him for\nmo. I am sorry. 1 want you to tell him for me. I want to right all the\nwrong I did in the body.\" I said to her, \"Can you see him?\" \"Yes,\"\nshe replied. \" How does he look V I asked. \"He has greyish blue eyes,\na beard, a rather prominent nose, a firm mouth, a large forehead, and he\nbrushed his hair up, so,\" brushing my hair with her hand, to show the\nfashion of his. \" He is of medium build, rather tall. He died of hemor\nrhage of the kidneys.\"\nThe above is an exact reproduction of Mrs. Piper's words, saving that I\nmay have failed to reproduce in every particular the precise word. The\nsubstance is exact, and the words in no way depart from the sense of what\nshe said. The description of Mr. West is photographic in its truth. His\nappearance at our interview was entirely unheralded by anything leading\nup to it. All that had gone before had been personal to myself and confined\nto my family and near relatives.\nWritten out between 3 and 3.30 p.m. on my return from Mrs. Piper's\nhotel.\nW. H. Savage.\nMr. M. J. Savage writes on June 20th, 1890:--\nIn explanation of this sitting of my brother, in which the Rev. Robert\nWest was reported as present, 1 need to say :\u2014\n1. He was a Congregational minister in Alton, 111., when my brother was\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 105\na minister, in the same denomination, at Jacksonville, in the same State.\nThey knew each other there.\n2. Mr. West was afterwards a minister here in Boston. He went to\nChicago and became editor of The Advance. While on that paper he wrote a\nsevere criticism on me, my doctrines, and my work. My brother had not\nseen this criticism, and did not even know about it.\n3. Neither of us knew the cause of his death. On writing to The Advance,\nafter this sitting, the correctness of Mrs. Piper's statement as to his death\nwas confirmed.\n4. My brother is the minister of the Unitarian Church in Watertown,\na suburb of Boston.\nMr. W. H. Savage writes July 1st, 1890, from Watertown, Mass. :\u2014\nMy brother made the appointment [for my sitting] by a letter saying\nthat a friend of his desired to see her. He gave her no name. [I have since\nlearnt from Mr. Savage that he had seen Mrs. Piper about one and a-half or\ntwo years previously.\u2014R. H.]\nMr. W. H. Savage further writes July 5th, 1890 :\u2014\n1. When Mrs. P. began speaking of Mr. West, she turned with a sur\nprised look, as at an unlooked for interruption, with the remark, \"Ah!\nhere is, ifcc.\"\n2. When I asked for a description she turned again in the samo direction\nand said, \"Hold up your head and let me look at you.\" Then she went on\nto describe as given in the statement.\n3. She gave date of death correctly, as well as cause.\n4. I did not know that West was dead.\n5. As my brother says, I had never heard of the attack on my brother of\nwhich the interview speaks.\n[For other incidents concerning Rev. Robert West, see the next account.\nFrom the Congregational Year Book for 1887, it appears that Rev. Robert\nWest died at Sycamore, 111., of Bright's disease, on October 25th, 1886 :\npastor's assistant at Shawmut Church, Boston, 1881-2 ; editor of Advance,\nChicago, from 1882 till death.\u2014R. H]\n27. Rev. M. J. Savage. January 1oth, 1889.\nJuly 24th, 1889.\nOn January 15th, 1889, the Rev. M. J. Savage had a sitting with Mrs.\nPiper, in the course of which Rev. Robert West purported to communicate,\nstating that his body was buried at Alton, 111., and giving the text on his\ntombstone. Mr. Savage was unaware of either of these facts at the time of\nthe sitting. He soon afterwards ascertained that Rev. Robert West's grave\nwas at Alton, 111., but he did not ascertain the text on the tombstone. He\nrecently informed me of the circumstance, and I have since obtained from\nMr. J. A. Cousley, editor of the Daily Telegraph, Alton, 111., a copy of the\ninscriptions on the tombstone. I requested Mr. Savage then to furnish me\nwith the text which had been given to him through Mrs. Piper. Yesterday\n\f10G Mr. R. Hodgmn.\nho found his notes made on the day of the sitting, and road uio the toxt,\nwhich agreed with that sent to me from Alton\u2014viz., \"Fervent in spirit,\nserving the Lord.\"\nIt.

(Joodeir,\nformerly of St. Louis, Mo., claimed to bo present. I was much surprised,\nfor I did not know he was dead, and I know of no reason why Mrs. Piper\nshould have associated us in any way in her mind. I had a slight\nacquaintance with him at one time ; and when ho was settled in St. Louis,\nI preached the sermon. I made no record at the time of anything beyond\nthe fact of his purporting to be present. Two days ago I went to the\nCongregational House in Boston, and ascertained the date of his death\u2014.\nFebruary 1st, 1886.\n28. 3\/ms Z. (loell-knoicn to Ktr. M. J. Havayc). Noeember 19th, 1888.\n[Account by Miss Z.]\nWhile talking with Mrs. Piper before she wont under the influence of\nlur control I showed her the stone taken from Mr. Savage, and asked her if\nshe would, when in the trance state, toll mo all she could about its story, as\n1 wished it for a test. She took it in her hand, put it between her teeth,\nand then said, ''It was given you by a gentleman, a great smoker, an\nEnglishman\u2014that is, directly descended in a straight line from English\nancestors ; a man as set as iron, very intellectual, and of a most powerful\nwill. A man I have the impression has boon to me, and whom I call very\nfascinating.\" Upon my denying that the man had scon her, as I thought\nthen was true, she said, \" I cannot have made a mistake ; but come quickly\ninto the other room, and sit down as soon as you can, for I can't wait long.''\nShe afterwards told me she was then partially in the trance condition.\nHer first communication was to me about my brother, whose hair I gave\nher. She said a young man called Nod anno and said, \" Holloa, Charlie !\nHolloa, Charlie ! \" and said Charlie was my brother. This Ned told of his\nown death by consumption some time ago ; how my brother was by his bed\nside near to the time he passed away; that ho spout a night by him just\nbefore he died, and said his other name began with \"M\" or \"N\" or\nsomething like, but that all was so far removed from mo that it would be\nimpossible to bo clear about it. All of which I found was true when I\nreturned home, and none of which I knew, save that a poor boy had died\nseveral years since of consumption \u2014a friend to whom my brother was kind.\nThe [first] name I never heard before, and was not sure even of his last\nname. His message to my brother was personal, and my brother felt it\ntruth. As soon as she finished this message she began to hurriedly grope\nabout for the \"stone,\" which was in her lap. She told mo the stone was\nfound in this country, a long way off, and near where some very valuable\nthings had been found. Under whore it was found are mines with lead and\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 107\npossibly silver. It was given to the owner, who was not I, but a man of\nvery firm will, and to whom I should return it, by a lady who came into and\nwent out of his life a long time since, and with whom I had no interest.\nThe lady she thowjht was now dead. There were three influences about the\nstone, as the lady gave the stone from the hand of soma one who gave it to\u2022\nher, in the presence of a middle-aged gentleman who stood beside his dear\nfriend, the present owner. The stone has been kept in a box on the back\npart of a desk in a room like an office, of an incessant smoker. Room did\nnot look like lawyer's or doctor's office. She then described the character\nof the man who gave me the stone, speaking particularly of will-power\nand intellect, and saying, \"Oh, what an old bach. ! isn't he ? Everything\nmust be just so fixed and even, or ho is frantic with his nerves ; and isn't\nha a fuss? A real old bach. !\" As she had already mentioned that I\nwas a \"double-twisted old maid,\" I tried to induce her to believe that the\nowner of the stone and I were in danger of coming nearer to each other than\nat present. She made answer to all my old maid silly airs, ' ' No, no, no,\nfor who then is Ella ? \" And then came in a quick tone, \" Who's Joseph !\nDon't you know ? Well, he is this man's father, and he says he was there\nwhen you took the stone, and he knows you well.\"\nThe letter which I gave her she said was so foreign in its magnetism to\nme that she could tell but little about it\u2014said it was written a long time ago,\nand came from a foreign land. In its surroundings whence it came were five\npeople, three gentlemen and two ladies\u2014one gentleman an elderly man. She\nreceived the name Elizabeth in its connection, and it seems to contain a sort\nof invitation. Near to the letter, or the one to whom it was written, comes\nWin. and Ruth. Then I gave her the lock of hair. She said, after a general\noutline of the character of the person from whose head it came, which was\nmuch the same as the character connected with the stone-owner, \" How'd\nyou come to have this hair ? The other was your brother's, but where in the\nworld did you get this I Oh, you cut it off yourself, didn't you ? Where did\nthat man get his big nose ? He's bean a trip to Europe lately for his health,\nand it has done him good, too. Tell him he'll bo as well as ever if he don't\noverwork, and that he has catarrh and part of the pain in his head comes\nfrom that.\" I said, \" Does this man smoke as much as the other?\" and she\nsaid, \" Oh no, not so much nearly, and I like him. He likes you, and you\nlike him, don't you ? \" I then triad to persuade her to believe in a romance\nconnecting me and the man from whose head I had taken the hair, thinking\nthat a very probable conclusion. She answered, \"Fiancee. No, didn't 1\nsay who was Ella and Gertrude and Phil ? Why, what are you talking about ?\nWhat's to be done with his other ties '? and let me tell you, if you are think\ning of that, there are as many as five women to be disposed of\u2014then \u2014oh T\nwhat's the use of trying to cheat me ! I know- all about it, and you never\ncither of you had such an idea, but Joseph is here, and is this man's father.\nHe says he sees you talking with his son, and there is never anything but kind\nfriendship about it. He stood by the window there all the time you were in\nthat queer little office, and you shouldn't try to cheat a medium so. Joking\nis all right, but you needn't try to fool him, for he knows. He's glad to send\na message by you to his son, he wishes you to tell him he watches over him\nalways, as he ever has, that he's so pleased to sec he has come to bo so good\n\f108 Mr. R. Hodgson.\na man, and that he tries so hard to help others, and he must not be dis\ncouraged or despondent about it, for he often helps many whom he does not\nknow anything about, that his father is so pleased to see how he ti'eats his\nmother, who is now in the earth-world. Also, he must not give Gertrude a\nworrying thought, for she is a good, good girl, and her father need never to\nworry a bit about her. \" Mrs. Piper told me to put that down in my head\nand tell it as soon as possible, for no one but the man himself knew what\nthoughts he had about Gertrude. She then told about Ella's sick headaches,\nand said \"Phil \" had a pain and trouble in his chest which his father must\nlook out for, as he did not know it, and a weak stomach, which was not so\nserious. A description of the pleasant influences about the home life of the\nfamily of six\u2014two \"big\" and four not so \"big\" people\u2014and the telling why\nDr. F. did not like Ella, because Ella did not like him, and would prefer\nothers not to come to him, closed the seance.\n[Notes on the above by the Rev. M. J. Savage.]\nJune 27ft, 1890.\nDuring the week preceding her visit to Mrs. P., Miss Z., having\naccidentally met me, told me that she was going to have a sitting with Mrs.\nP. on the following Monday. I then said, \"This will be a capital opportunity\nfor a test. She will never think of connecting you with me in any way. I\nwould like you to take two or three things for me, and see if she can get\nanything about me.\" I arranged to take these things to her on Saturday, but\nnot being well, failed to do so. Meeting her in the Sunday school-room\nafter church on Sunday, I asked her to step with me into the study, and get\nthem. We went together to the study ; I unlocked my desk, and took the\nstone from a collection of curios which lie there, without telling her anything\nof its history. I gave her also a letter and a lock of my own hair, which she\ncut off at my request.\nTho history of the stone is as follows :\u2014In the spring of 18(i5 a party of\nfriends, among them myself, living at San Mateo, Cal., went across the\ncoast range of mountains to the seashore, where there is a famous pebble\nbeach, called the Pescadero Peach. While there one of the party picked up\nthis curious stone among others, and it was given me by a lady of my\nacquaintance in the party, and has since lain most of the time in my roller-\ntopped desk in my study, not strictly in a box. There are mines not far\naway from Pescadero Beach. I do not know whether the lady is dead or not,\nand have no means of easily tracing her. There was a middle-aged gentleman\nin the party, one of my parishioners. I do not know who picked up the\natone.\nMrs. P. 's reference to my habits as a smoker is sufficiently accurate, and\nmy study looks like an oftico. Ella is the name of my wife, and Joseph is\nthe name of my father.\nWhat Mrs. P. said of me before becoming entranced was inaccurate as\nregards my ancestry. I am of American birth and parentage, though my\nancestors, like those of most Americans, came from England.\nThe letter was one not written to me, and one in which I had no personal\ninterest. It was an old letter, bearing evident marks of age in it3 faded\nyellow tint, and came from England. I know nothing of the circumstances\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 10[>\nunder which the letter was written, and do not think they could now be\nascertained. References to nose and trip to Europe and catarrhal tendency\nall correct. Gertrude and Phil are the names of two of my children. The\nreferences to the physical condition of my wife and son were substantially\ncorrect, and Phinuit was also right in describing us as a family of six, as I\nhave four children.\nM. J. Savage.\nJioie 27th, 1890.\nRev. M. J. Savage writes on June 30th, 18!)0 :\u2014\nI have seen Miss Z.\n1. She made the engagement for her sitting in person, and about a week\nin advance. Two other ladies were present at the time, and she did not give\nher name.\n2. The last name of \"Ned,\" in her report, begins with \"N.\"\nMiss 7,. writes, about June 30th [received July 1st, 1890] :\u2014\nMr. Hodgson,\u2014At the request of Mr. M. J. Savage, I write you an\naddition to the report which you already have, of a sitting which I had with\nthe medium, Mrs. Piper, November 19, 1888.\nMy appointment with the medium was made by myself personally. I saw\nher for only a moment at the time, as others were waiting for her, and I had\nno conversation whatever with Mrs. Piper on any other subject than the\ntime convenient for her to give me for a scance. I had never seen her\nbefore, and have never met her since, except the day she sat to give me\ntests\u2014November 19.\nThe point which Mr. Savage tells me you wish to know more about\nis in regard to something told me of my aunt, who was then in Vermont.\nIn the midst of other tests, and utterly without suggestion from me, Mrs.\nPiper suddenly said she saw a lady by the name of Marie or Maria, and in\nthe room with her was, she should say, her daughter, perhaps, named Estelle\nor Stella. The lady Maria had some trouble on the back of her hands and\nwrists which looked like eczema. They were very troublesome to her, but\nshe would soon come to Boston for a long visit, and her health would be\nmuch improved.\nI have an aunt Maria living in Vermont, some one hundred and fifty\nmiles from Boston, who has a daughter Stella. I immediately wrote my\naunt, asking if she had any trouble with her hands, and in about two days\nreceived a reply, that she had been much annoyed by something on the\nback of her hands, and extending up the arms beyond the wrists a little,\nwhich she supposed to be ivy poison, as she knew of nothing else which\ncould have caused it. She later came to visit us, which was unexpected to\nall at that time, and as her health improved she has had no more of the\ntrouble with her hands.\nMi\u00ab3 Z. adds, on July oth :\u2014-I knew nothing of any trouble with my\naunt's hands or arms until told of it by Mrs. P., November 19th, 1888. Then\nI wrote inquiring about it, and received the answer which I wrote to you a\nfew days since.\n\f.110 Mr. R. Hodgson.\n2!'. .1\/,-.s. IT, March, 1886.\n[From Miss E. R. Webster.]\n158, North Avenue, Cambridge.\nMy Dear Mr. Hoduson, \u2014You will find enclosed a statement of the\n\u2022experience of the lady of whom I spoke to you. It was written down as\nMrs. D. told it, and is necessarily crude, but I think contains all the\nfacts. . . . Emily R. Webster.\nThe statement enclosed by Miss Webster is as follows :\u2014.\nJanuary 24th, 1888.\nMrs. W.'s son, Nelson (J. W., ran away from home when he was between\nfourteen and fifteen years old, about the year 1869. From that time she\nheard from him very irregularly, sometimes a period of several years\nelapsing between the letters. In the intervals between his letters, she knew\nnothing about his whereabouts, as he was roving from one country to\nanother. The last letter which his mother received from him was written\nthree years before the time when she received information about him from\nMrs. Piper. She had given up all hope of seeing him again, and was\ninclined to think that he was dead. She had been to Mrs. Piper not [more]\nthan twice before the sitting in question. On these occasions she had been\nthere for the purpose of receiving communications from children who had\ndied a short time before, and had received no message concerning Nelson.\nSome time in March, 1880 (this date is correct within a month, without\niloubt), she went to Mrs. Piper for the purpose of obtaining some assurance\nof his death, if nothing more. Mrs. Piper did not know her name, and had\nno idea what she wished to find out. She went into a trance,[however, and\nslid without previous explanation, \"You will hear from Nelson within two\nweeks.\" She then went on to tell her that the first letter would not be from\nNelson, but from a friend of his (Mrs. Piper told his name, but the narrator\nhas forgotten it) concerning him. This would be followed by a letter from\nNelson, the contents of which she did not disclose. She then told Mrs. W.\nthat her son was coming home. This is all the account that remains of the\nsitting. Within the stated time the letters arrived, and later, one an\nnouncing his departure for home. These letters all came from California.\nHe arrived in Cambridge June 15th, 1886, and remained with his mother\nuntil she died, August 10th, 1886.\nMrs. W. wag a Spiritualist, and believed that these communications\ncame from the spirit- world, but immediately on her return from Mrs.\nPiper's, she told her sister of the information she had received, so the vision\nwas not coloured by the light of subsequent events.\nThis above account is given by this sister, who hereby testifies to its\ncorrectness. Mrs. H. A. D.\nMrs. D. related this incident to me a day or two after her sister told her,\nand before Mrs. W.'s son had returned. Emily R. Webster.\nIn reply to further inquiries Miss Webster wrote :\u2014\nNo record was ever mad.) of Mrs. W.'s experience with Mrs. Piper.\nMrs. D. related it from memory, and the only strengthening evidence we\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. Ill\nhave is that of my memory, according to which her last account varied scarcely\nat all from her first one, given shortly after the events occurred. It is not\nprohable that the letters exist, for the son destroyed all his mother's papers\nafter her death. There is no independent evidence to confirm the date of\nthe sitting, unless Mrs. Piper has it, which is unlikely, as she did not know\nMrs. W. 's name. The dates of the letters too are unobtainable. The son\nreturned on the Panama steamer which reached New York on or about the\n16th of June, 1880. The name has gone from Mrs. D.'s mind.\nMrs, Browne (ne'e Webster) writes on February 16th, 1890 :\n\" I have seen Mrs. D. this afternoon, and asked her if Mrs. Piper gave\nthe correct name of the person who wrote to Mrs. W. about her son. She\nis absolutely sure that she did. This coincides with my impression of the\nstory as Mrs. D. told it to me.\"\n30. Mm A. M. R.\nBoston, February Uth, 1888.\nI have had a number of sittings with Mrs. Piper, I think thirteen within\nthe past three years, at intervals of some months. At the first sitting I tried\nto get some information regarding a friend who had then been dead about three\nmonths. I was told by Dr. Phinuit, the medium's regular \" control,\" that I\nprobably would not get anything satisfactory for some time, and was advised\nto wait about eight months. At the expiration of that time I sat again, and\n-at the third sitting from that time (I think my dates are correct) the medium\nwas controlled for a few minutes during the hour by what purported to be\nthe spirit of my friend, who, however, seemed to have such imperfect control\nthat he could only speak in a choked, whispering voice. At the next sitting\nhe was stronger, and now is able to take control and talk easily and distinctly\nfor perhaps half an hour. I have received the impression, from what has\nbeen told me through the medium, that for some months after the death of\nmy friend he did not sufficiently understand the conditions of his new exist\nence, or the conditions under which ho could return, to be able to reach mo\nthrough any medium.\nA. M. R.\nBoston, Derember 17th, 1888.\nI spent a very pleasant evening with Mrs. Piper a week ago Saturday,\nand had an interesting sitting.\nMy friend took control first. He used to be lame ; had a fall when\nhe was a baby, and one leg was shorter than the other, and he always\nwalked with a crutch, stopping only on one foot. He has often said to me,\n*' You know my lame leg ; well, that is all well now.\" This evening ho sat\nnbout five or six feet from my folding bed, on which were some ornaments.\n1 asked him if he thought he could walk over there, and he tried very hard\nto raise himself from the chair, without succeeding at first. I told him ho\nhad better not try, as it might bo too much for the medium. He insisted on\ntrying, however, but commenced rubbing one leg, and asked me if I\nremembered which leg was lame. At last he raised himself, but instead of\nwalking, as Dr. P. would do, ho leaned heavily on me, and seemed to hop\n\f112 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nor hitch along on one foot, exactly as a person would do who could only use\none foot in walking. After he came back, he dropped into the chair\nexhausted, and said that was the hardest work he had done since coming\nback, and that it was too much of the real life for him ; he did not like it ;\nhe was very glad to have had the opportunity to handle the articles with the\nhands of the medium, because now he could handle them with his spirit\nhands, but he did not like it ; he would rather sit in the chair and talk.\nI had both of them write their names on a block of paper, with my name.\nThe two styles of handwriting were very different ; both were scrawly, but I\nthink I can detect quite a strong resemblance in the capital letter H to my\nfriend's old handwriting, which was peculiar, although he did not spell his.\nown Christian name right. ... I handed my friend a grape, and\nasked him what it was. He insisted that it was an orange. Then I handed\nhim an orange, and asked what that was. He said it was a ball ; did not\nknow what else to call it. I tried the same thing with Dr. P., and he called\nthem by their right names at once. I told him the mistake my friend had\nmade, and he said, \" Well, he does not handle things in the material world\nas much as I do ; he is as much above sensing an orange as you would be\nabove your dead body if you had passed out of it,\" or words to that effect.\nI asked my friend if he would not get my sister, who seemed to be there,\nand Dr. P. and all to stand back of me when the medium returned, to see if\nshe could not see them. So when half out of her trance she exclaimed at some\nthing which she saw. She described afterwards three persons whom she saw\u2014\ntwo gentlemen and one lady\u2014and also some beautiful flowers. I have had\na similar experience with her twice before. On one of these occasions she\ndescribed my friend (referred to above) in general terms, and added : \" His.\nnose was just a little bit crooked.\" This amused me, as my friend and I,\nbefore his death, frequently disputed as to the straightness of his nose, and\nI always maintained that it was slightly crooked. I am satisfied that Mrs.\nPiper could have known nothing whatever of this.\nA. M. R.\nBoston, Mass., June 23rd, 1890.\nI have had a number of sittings since the date of my last letter to you,\nand have made notes of what was said within a short time after the sittings.\nAt each sitting I have conversed with two personalities, Dr. I'., the regular\ncontrol, and the control which claims to be the spirit of my friend H. I\ncannot give you very much in the nature of tests, as most of my conversation\nwith Dr. P. was of a personal nature, consisting of advice, &c, more\ninteresting to me than it would be to anyone else. He recognises me cach\ntime as an old friend, and remembers a great deal of what he has said to me\nat previous sittings ; in fact, his memory seems to be quite a remarkable one.\nHe has prophesied a number of material changes which are to come into my\nlife, and which I do not foresee. At first ho mentioned the time which he\nthought would elapse before these changes would take place ; but when the\nspecified time passed, and nothing happened, he said that the changes,\nprophesied would certainly come about, but that ho could not tell definitely\nin regard to time. Several unimportant things have happened which he said\nwould happen ; for instance, that a certain person whom I had not seen for\na long time was coming to see me, &c. A lady with whom I am well\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 113\nacquainted at one time had a sitting with Mrs. Piper, and Dr. P. told her\nshe was not going to marry a certain gentleman with whom she was at the\ntime very friendly. This lady's name was K. At a later date, at a sitting\nof my own, I told Dr. P. that he must have xnade a mistake in regard to K.,\na3 she was engaged to the gentleman mentioned, and expected to be married\nshortly. He excused himself by saying that he had had only one sitting with\nK., and did not get the right influence ; that she was very mediumistic\nherself, and ' weakened him when talking with her ; but he added that\n\"there was many a slip 'twixt cup and lip.\" It turned out that K. never did\nmarry the gentleman in question, as he was taken with a hemorrhage, and\ndied quite suddenly a few months after their engagement. Dr. P. has,\ndescribed living friends of mine very accurately, one in particular whom I\nremember, with whom the medium was not acquainted, and whom I think\nshe had never seen.\nWhen my friend H. takes control of the medium it seems to be quite a\ndifferent personality, although there is something in the voice or manner of\nspeaking that is like Dr. P. The voice, however, is not nearly so loud.\nWhen I asked him once why this was, he told me that Dr. P. was right by\nhim and that he could not stay a moment without his help. In a great\nmany little ways he is quite like what my friend used to be when living, so\nmuch so that I am afraid it would take a great deal of explanation to make\nme believe that his identical self had not something to do with it, wholly\napart from the medium's powers or from anything that may be in my own\nmind concerning him. This, too, in spite of the fact that he does not\nahcayt know how to spsll his own name correctly, though I am happy to be\nable to state that he certainly knows what his name is. He says the longer\nhe is away the more he forgets about things in this life, though he does not\nforget his friends. In one of the earlier sittings he gave the name of a\nmutual acquaintance, a gentleman with whom he wa3 very friendly just\nb3fore he died. Also in one of the early sittings he asked me if I did not\nremember about his lameness, saying that his spiritual body was not lame,\nbut that he had to come back that way so that I would recognise him. This\nwas before he was able to take control himself. He insists that he can see\nme in my room, and often knows what I am doing. At one time he askedi\nme how I liked that little drab-coloured book that I had been reading with\nanother person. There was a particular book which I had been reading\naloud with a friend, but it was covered with brown paper, as I remember, and\nI had no idea what the cloth cover was. On reaching home I took off the\npaper cover, and found that it was a drab-coloured cloth cover. I may have\nseen the book when new, and before the paper cover was put on, but if I did\nI had completely forgotten about it. I asked him one time if he could telt\nwhere I had been that day. He said I had been in a box with windows, and\nhad taken out a pencil and written, that after that I went in something else\nwith horses, then into a building, where he left me. I had that day been in\na drawing-room car of a railroad train, and had done some writing en route,\nhad then taken a carriage to my destination.\nWhen I talk with H. about the philosophy of spirit return, he always\nseems more or less puzzled, and generally refers me to Dr. P., saying that he\nknows more about such things. He hardly knew at first what I meant by the\nI\n\f114 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nmedium, but says that he has for the time being another organism, and tl>at\nis about all ho knows. When he asked me why I did not come oftener to\nsee him, I explained to him, somewhat as I would to a child, that the medium\nwas not always at command, and that I had to pay money for a sitting with\nher. He said, \"I am an expensive article, then?\" I replied, \"Yes, you\nspirits arc quite expensive articles.\"\nA. M. R.\n31. Miss A. A. B., Boston. January or February, 1888.\nJuly \\Uh, 1890.\nYour letter to my mother . . . was received. She does not think\nher sitting with Mrs. Piper was of sufficient interest to report. I had one\nsitting, and will send you the account of some portions of it, and you can\nuse it or not, as you see fit. I wrote it out quite fully at the time.\nI went to Mrs. Piper chiefly to see if she could tell me of some china we\nhad lost. It had been stored during a long absence in Europe, and upon our\nreturn we could not find it. It was taken from our house, among other\nthings, by a man who had been in our employ for many years. There was\nno thought in my mind of his dishonesty. I said nothing about it to\nMrs. Piper either before or during the trance, and she did not even know my\nname. I was determined to give her no clue of any kind, and only once\nasked a leading question, and then purposely to see if she would take the\nopportunity to build anything from it.\nShe began by speaking of my father's illness, describing accurately his\nsymptoms, and said his sister Emmeline (who had died many years ago) was\nwatching over him, and that he would be much better in the fall. This latter\nproved true. Then she said, \"You have lost some china, and you feel very\nbadly about it. It was taken from your home by a man who has been in\nthe employ of your family a long time. It is in his surroundings now. You\nmust get him to restore it, but do not accuse him of having taken it. He\nhas already been spoken to about it, and thinks you suspect him. It was a\nvery wicked thing for him to do, very.\" Several months after Mrs. Piper\ntold me this, the china was found precisely where it had been first placed,\nand where it had been overlooked, as the box was believed to contain\nsomething else.\nMrs. Piper continued, \"There is a Mary here, who wishes to speak to\nyou. Do you know who I mean ?\" \" No,\" I said. She went on speaking\nof other things, finally broke off\u2014\"This Mary says you must understand who\nshe is.\" I said I could not think who it could be. Again, after speaking of\nother things, \" Mary will not go away. You have a friend Lizzie, haven't\nyou?\" \"Yes.\" \" Well, it is her sister. She had such a bad cough. Now\ndo you know her ? \" \" Yes.\" \" She wants me to tell you to tell Lizzie that\nshe is happy, and she doesn't cough now, and she sends her love.\" All this\nvery emphatically. Mary I had never seen ; she died years ago in\nconsumption, before I knew Lizzie, and without the explanation I should\nnever have thought of her. Once again Mrs. Piper returned to her, and\nsaid, \" Mary is still here, and wants you very much to tell Lizzie that she\nwants to see her,\" adding, \"you will tell her, won't you?\"\nThe one rather leading question I asked was if an aunt for whom I was\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 115\nnamed was present. She said, \"No. Do you wish to speak with her?\"\n\" Yes.\" \"Then I will have to call her.\" In a moment she said, \" She does\nnot come ; I can't find her. Did she pass away a long time ago ? \" \"Yes,\nmany years.\" \"That is the reason she does not come. She has grown too\nfar away from this world.\" \" Do they, then, forget this world ? \" I asked.\n\" All that is material is forgotten as of no consequence. It is all a spiritual\ngrowth, and all spiritual growth here will help you there. \"\n\" Did you ever own a bird ? \" \" Yes.\" \" It is a parrot, and is flying all\nabout your head now.\" \" Do birds, then, have another life ? \" \"I tell you\nthis\u2014anything that you have had here and want there again, you will have.\nYou will have that parrot again.\" I never owned but one bird, and that\nwas a grey parrot.\n\" Do you expect to go to a party in a few days ? \" \" No. \" \"Well, you\nwill. Within three days I see you in a large company.\" I did go in just\nthree days, most unexpectedly. Another prophecy, that she saw me across\nthe ocean within two years, was not fulfilled. She described accurately my\nhome surroundings and my life. She spoke of a number of persons being\npresent, always giving the name, and several times naming the member\nof the family to whom they sent a message. She also mentioned a number\nof names that I did not know at all.\nThese are the chief points of the sitting, I think, though I have not by\nme the report I wrote at the time. It made a deep impression upon me. I\nlihall be much interested in the report of the Society.\u2014Yours very truly,\n(Miss) A. A. B.\nMiss B. writes on July 17th, 1890 :\u2014\nI cannot give you the precise date of my sitting, but it was a month or\ntwo after my mother's, in January or February of 1888. My mother made\nmy engagement without mentioning for whom she made it.\nThe original draft of my interview is in our town house, and in a day or\ntwo I will go in and get it, and then add some other matter. If I remember\nrightly, the rest of it was so very personal I should hesitate to publish it\neven without my name. 1 will then try to give you some statement of my\nmother's sitting.\nMiss B. writes on July 21st, 1890 :\u2014\nI will add from my notes upon my sitting with Mrs. Piper what I have\nomitted from my first paper.\n\"You have a brother William in the spirit-land.\" ... I had a\nbrother William who died when a child.\n\" I see you painting. You get too absorbed and got very tired. Work\nfor half an hour and then walk about the room. You are not strong enough\nto work steadily.\" . . . You were very strong once, but for some reason\nlost your health. But you are much better, and will be very well again. You\nare made of good material, and there is no disease.\" It is true I was\nparticularly strong, but was poisoned and for some years was much out of\n1 2\n\f11G Mr. R. Hodgson.\nhealth. When I saw Mrs. Piper I was much better. My painting affected\nme as she said.\nSho spoke of different friends in the spirit-land as being present, only-\nsaying of them that they were very happy.\nSho broke off very abruptly once and said, \" Who is Sadie ? \" \" I do not\nknow.\" \"Yes, you do. She says she did not know you, but knew Lettie.\nShe had a cancer in her cheek\u2014now you know 1\" \" Yes. \" \" She says, give\nher love to Lettie.\" This was a young girl whom I had never seen, who died\nas described, and of whom I had heard much from \" Lettie.\"\nCertain other incidents of my life she described with perfect correctness,\nand the sitting closed.\nOf my mother's sitting I can give you but very little, as she had for\ngotten much of it. She spoke first of my father's illness, saying that was\nthe most important thing in her life then. She described correctly his\nsymptoms, and told her, as she had told me, that Emmelino was watching\nover him. She described her home and surroundings correctly, particularly\nmentioning Annie, my mother's maid, as being such a very nice person, and\nsaid she would live with us a long time.\nShe also spoke of a brother \"Joe,\" who lived a long way across the\ncountry, and who would come into her life in some important matter. The\nbrother lives in Cleveland, and \" the important matter \" has not yet trans\npired. She spoke of Judge B., and my mother said she knew no such\nperson. Mrs. P. said, \"Your husband will know him. Ask him when\nyou go home.\" My mother did so, and found he was an old and particular\nfriend of my father's, who died many years ago. My mother never knew him.\n32. Mr. A. J. C, Mcriden, Conn, About Febmari\/, 1889.\nMiss A. A. B. [see the preceding account] writes on July 17th, 1890 :\u2014\nI enclose to you a statement of a sitting my uncle, Mr. A. J. C. , had with\nMrs. Piper. I made the appointment for him, about one year after I had\nmy sitting. I made the engagement in my own name, but did not mention\nfor whom I made it. The remarks in regard to my uncle are very accurate,\nas he is very much of a recluse, living among his books, much attached to\nhis home, and with the great aversion to medicine which she amusingly\nillustrates. He is also \" open to conviction,\" but hard to convince. Since\nhe has put down the prophecy of my going to Europe and marrying there, I\nwill add to the statement she made me on this subject, which I omitted in my\naccount, that she said I would be in very congenial company there ; that I\nwould marry and be very happy ; and with much emphasis, putting her hand\nin mine, \"This will certainly happen, and when it comes to you you will\nremember what I tell you. \" I mention it as being rather remarkable, her\ntelling this to both of us, the sittings being a year apart, and I having had\nno communication with her in the meantime.\n[Account by Mr. A. J. C]\n\"lam Dr. Favineau [Phinuit]. What do you want 2 \"\n\" You have in your surroundings William. He is not woll and does not\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 117\ntake good care of himself.\" (Thus statement, if made concerning Mr.\nWilliam , my brother-in-law, at whose house I was a visitor, would be\ntrue. )\n\" Henry is here in the spirit\u2014says he is a friend of yours, but considerably\nyounger ; knew your family well ; there is something about over the water.\"\n(I did not at first think of Henry \"C,\" and, upon my saying that I did not\nknow who was meant, the remark about \" over the water \" was made, and\nthis reminded me of Henry \"C,\" of Hartford, Conn., with whom I had\nplanned a European trip. It seems he had spoken of it to his friends, for it\nwas mentioned in his obituary published in the Hartford Conrant.) \"Gives\nyou his love.\" \" 1 see you in your library\u2014books all around and a desk\nthere. There are four in your family. I see a lady\u2014she is your sister ;\nyour mother is there\u2014she is lame in this (right) foot. There is a little\ngirl\u2014not so very little\u2014she is a sister's child ; she plays music a great\ndeal.\"\nIs the sister who is with me older or younger than I ?\n\" She is a great deal older ; at least, she looks so. I see your father's\npicture, with a remarkable expression ; no hair on top of his head ; hair\naround the base. You have had trouble with irregularity of heart action.\nYou thought something might be the matter with the heart. But there was\nnothing. It was nervous, sympathetic ; came from the stomach. You must\nbe very particular about your diet. Be careful what you eat. About two\nyears ago you made a change which was very beneficial.\"\nShall I take medicine ?\n\"No, there is no use giving you medicine. You are not that kind of a\nman. You would let the vials stand until the bottoms dropped out before\nyou would take it. Do you know fussy willow ? You can take some of that\nand pour on boiling water and let it stand, and take a wine-glass full of that\nif you like.\n\" I don't like your mother's condition, butshe will live a good while yet.\nYou lead a very regular, quiet life, with nothing to excite you, and are in\ncomfortable circumstances, financially, and it will be a long time before\nyou are in the spirit-land. There is one Tom here, and says that he is a\nfriend of yours\u2014that his family lived near you. His hair is very grey\u2014\nsays, remember him to his wife. Your father is here ; says you thought of\ndoing something to your house ; that }'ou had better postpone. You will go\n.away within two years on account of somebody's health.\"\nDo you mean permanently ?\n\"Xo. You are so settled that nothing on earth can take you away.\nYour mother's mind is preserved remarkably. Is it not wonderful ? \"\nHow many are her family ?\n\" Five brothers\u2014three are living\u2014two in the spirit. Three sisters.\"\nWrong. There are five sisters.\n\u2022'I can see only three. Your sister who is with you has had trouble\nwith one tooth since you came away. Your niece, who is with you, has a\nhumour, a breaking out.\" I don't think so. \"She has. Ask your sister\nand she will tell you. You are staying with friends here\u2014a sister. You\nhave a niece who paints.

Your\nmother will know about it. You deal in real estate.\" No. \"There is\nsomething about land\u2014I see land.\" I own land. \" Hurry and ask your\nquestions. I am tired.\n\" You do not readily believe. You are willing to receive evidence, but\nhard to convince. You have been around a good deal, and know the world\nwell.\"\nI do not remember the precise date of my visit to Mrs. Piper. I think\nit was in February, 1889. My niece made the appointment for me, giving\nher no information regarding me. I waited about an hour in the parlour\nwhile she was occupied with another, Dr. Savage, she said, and said that she\nwas tired. At my first leisure, two or three days afterwards, I wrote out the\nabove, putting down what she said in the order in which it was said, as\nnearly as I could recollect.\nIn the early part her statements were, in the main, positive and\nemphatic. Afterwards, especially at the last, mostly tentative and inter\nrogatory, and at the last, in response to my inquiries for names of friends in\nthe spirit-land (made for the purpose of testing her powers), her guesses\nwere no better than anyone could make. She many times repeated, \" I am\ntired.\"\nAll the statements relative to my family were strikingly accurate, except\nas to the number of my sisters, and that relative to my sister having trouble\nwith her tooth. My niece had the humour or breaking out, although I was.\nnot aware of it, and questioned it.\nMother was at the time nearly eighty-eight, now past ninety, and still a\ncyclopiedia of historical, literary, and general information.\nThe diagnosis for me was correct, so far as I know or can judge. The\nfamily physician had examined me for heart trouble and said substantially\ntha same, and a system of dieting adopted two years previously had helped\nme greatly.\nFather's picture is as described. (It represents him at eighty-five. He\ndied at ninety-three.) There was a \" Tom,\" commonly so-called (Thomas.\nClark), answering the description, who married my cousin and removed from\nhere to California, where he died, a full believer in the Spiritualistic faith.\nFather's mother's name was Elizabeth. I was thinking of doing some\nthing to the house which is not yet done. Mother knows nothing of the\n\"Sarah.\" The prophecies regarding my niece and myself have not been\nfulfilled.\nMy recollection of the order in which the statements were made was.\napproximate only. There was no connection between them, but abrupt\nchanges of subject.\nBefore the seance Mrs. P. asked if I came for medical advice. I said,\n\"No,\" my object being merely to investigate, to witness myself\nphenomena of which I had heard.\nA. J. C.\nMeriden, Conn., July 1oth, 1890.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. llf)\n33. Mr. F. S. S. Record of Seance with Mrs. Piper [about June, 1888].\nThe following record was written immediately after returning from Mm.\nP.'s house :\u2014\nA week before the seance recorded below, I went with another man, both\nof us unknown to Mrs. Piper, to make an appointment. She gave us a\nsitting at that time, but with no success. 1 I then made an appointment for a\nweek ahead, not through the Psychical Society, but on my own account, and\nuot giving my name. My friend, subsequently to my second seance, assured\nme that he had given no information of any kind whatever to Mrs. P., or to\nanyone else. At the second meeting the medium soon began to talk in the\nusual broken English dialect, so dear to mediums, as follows :\u2014\n\"There is a 'Lou' in your surroundings. She is Louise, but she is\ncalled ' Lou. ' \" (My sister has a step-daughter of this name.) \"There are\nfive of you; three brothers, one of them Harry.\" (Answer: \"No, Harry\nis a brother-in-law.\" I have one own brother.) \"Then there are Lizzie and\nFanny, who are associated together.\" (My brother-in-law has two sisters,\nLizzie and Fanny.) \"Lou is now with Lizzie.\" (They were at the time\ntogether at Greenfield, Mass.) \"Lou and Harry are associated\" (father\nand daughter), \"and Lizzie and Fanny\" (sisters). \" Then there is your\nmother.\" (Question: What is she like?) \"She wears her hair, which is\nwavy and grey, drawn simply back on the sides \" (accompanied by gesture\nexactly indicating). \"She has a very sweet face, and pleasant smile.\" (Two\nm:trked characteristics.) \"She has a sister ; she is Sarah.\" (Question :\nWell, Sarah is her middle name. What is her other ? Could not answer.)\n\"She is different from your mother ; has very original ways of thinking, and\nideas. She is very positive ; set as the hills ; and doesn't believe in mc.\nShe is a crank, and so am I, but she will have to be a good deal bigger than\nshe is to scare me. \"\n(Tiiis part of the conversation is very interesting, as it bristles with many\nfacts. My aunt is of very different nature and temperament from my mother\nin many ways. Her thought is original ; she is progressive and radical in her\nideas. Positiveness and firmness are most certainly characteristics of hers.\nMy aunt had given several sittings to Mrs. P. , but with no success ; hence\nshe had become somewhat sceptical ; hence the medium's words, \"She does\nnot believe in me.\" Mrs. P. had no possible means of associating my aunt\nand me, to my knowledge, as neither of us had spoken of the other to the\nmedium. Her allusions to her \" having to be a good deal bigger than she is\nnow, &c,\" are also very pertinent.)\n\" You and your brother have lately had a change.\" (Question : What do\nyou mean?) \"Your domestic relations have changed, you are living in a\ndifferent place.\" (My parents had lately died, and my brother and I had\nmoved from the house where we had all lived.) \"There is somebody in\nyour surroundings who is lame. \" (I had been lame off and on for several\nyears, from an injury to the shin-bone from a blow. At the time of my visit\nto Mrs. P. there was no trace of lameness in my gait. Question : What is\ni I learn from Mr. 8. that Mis. Piper tried but was unable to go into trance on\nthis 6rst occasion. Both Mr. S. and his companion are well known to me.\u2014R.H.\n\f120 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nthe matter ?) \" He is lame here below the knee, on the shin. It is like an\naccident ; there is a growth of some kind.\" (This was said before touching\nthe place. There had been some enlargement of the periosteum.) \" Yes,\nFrank \"\u2014(I had previously mentioned my first name in course of inquiry)\n\u2014\" has had a good deal of trouble with the knee. You don't sleep well, do\nyou? Your condition is poor from wakefulness.\" (Perfectly true.) \"You\nhave been on a journey lately for your health.\" (Question: Where?)\nAnswer: \"Isn't there a place called New York? Well, you went in that\ndirection and then south.\" (I had been shortly before this for a change and\nfor my health as far south as Aiken, S.C.) \" You will take another journey\nbefore long. You will be called away by another's illness.\" [This did not\ncome true.] \" I can't see it all definitely, but you will go away in about a\nmonth.\"\n\" Is there any bill on your mind ? \" (Question : Bill, what do you mean\n\u2014what kind of bill?) \"A bill, or a mortgage, or anything? Are you\nthinking of buying any building ? \" (Two days before this seance a man\nhad spoken to my brother and me about taking a house as an investment,\nupon which there was a mortgage. We three were the only persons\ncognisant of this.) \"You are sometimes blue and discouraged, owing to\npoor physical condition ; but you will come out all right, and you have a\nhappy-go-lucky temperament.\" (I had suffered so from sleeplessness, owing\nto my lameness, that it did wear upon me a great deal.)\nThere the medium came to, and the seance ended. This is my only\nexperience of the sort.\nF. S. S.\n34. \"Mr. M. N.\" March, 1888.\nApril 5th [1889].\nBriefly stated, the three cases of prophesying which I have experienced\nwith Mrs. Piper, and which have come true, are as follows :\u2014\nAbout end March of last year I made her a visit (having been in the habit\nof doing so, since early in February, about once a fortnight). She told mc\nthat a death of a near relative of mine would occur in about six weeks, from\nwhich I should realise some pecuniary advantages. I naturally thought of\nmy father, who was advanced in yeara, and whose description Mrs. Piper\nhad given me very accurately some week or two previously. She had not\nspoken of him as my father, but merely as a person nearly connected with\nme. I asked her at that sitting whether this person was the one who would\ndie, but she declined to state anything more clearly to me. My wife, to\nwhom I was then engaged, went to see Mrs. Piper a few days afterwards,\nand she told her (my wife) that my father would die in a few weeks.\nAbout the middle of May my father died very suddenly in London from\nheart failure, when he was recovering from a very slight attack of bronchitis,\nand the very day that his doctor had pronounced him out of danger.\nPrevious to this Mrs. Piper (as Dr. Phinuit) had told me that she would\nendeavour to influence my father about certain matters connected with his\nwill before he died. Two days after I received the cable announcing his\ndeath my wife and I went to see Mrs. Piper, and she [Phinuit] spoke of his\npresence, and his sudden arrival in the spirit-world, and said that he (Dr.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 121\nPhinuit) had endeavoured to persuade him in those matters while my father\nwas sick. Dr. Phinuit told me the state of the will, and described the\nprincipal executor, and said that he (the executor) would make a certain\ndisposition in my favour, subject to the consent of the two other executors,\nwhen I got to London, Eng. Three weeks afterwards I arrived in London ;\nfound the principal executor to be the man Dr. Phinuit had described. The\nwill went materially as he had stated. The disposition was made in my\nfavour, and my sister, who was chiefly at my father's bedside the last three\ndays of his life, told me that he had repeatedly complained of the presence\nof an old man at the foot of his bed, who annoyed him by discussing his\nprivate affairs.\nThe second instance I would give you is as follows :\u2014\nDr. Phinuit stated that I would receive a professional offer within two\nweeks, by letter, to my present address, with the name of the manager's firm\non the left hand corner of the envelope, and (as far as I could understand him)\neither from a man named French, or else from a Frenchman. Within the\ntime stated the letter came, answering to the description of its appearance,\nand to this address, but the offer was from a Frenchman.\nThe third is as follows :\u2014\nDr. Phinuit stated on one occasion that some relative was suffering at that\ntime from a sore or wounded thumb. We knew of no one at the time, and\nthought this would be a good test. A few days afterwards we went to my\nwife's grandmother's to dinner, and we asked our aunt how all the family\nwere, and particularly if she knew anyone who had a swollen or sore thumb.\nShe said, \"No.\" Shortly after this conversation my aunt stated that she\nhad received a letter from cousins in Philadelphia. My wife asked how they\nwere, and particularly for a certain cousin Jennie. \" Oh, by-the-bye,\" was\nthe reply, \"Jennie has had a little accident ; she has injured her thumb in\nsome machine.\"\nI chose these three instances for their simplicity, and I hope they will be\nof service to you. My wife, as a rule, attended my sittings with Mrs. Piper,\nand can attest these facts. I cannot be sure of any other I can call upon to\nsupport my testimony. I have certainly mentioned certain foretellings to\nothers before they became facts, but I cannot recall to whom I have done so, as\nthese matters have chiefly concerned myself and my wife. I leave it to your\ngood taste to print nothing that will identify me or my family with any\npublication you may issue, either at your meetings or in the papers. I can\nalso say that Dr. Phinuit cured me, or apparently did so, by a prescription\nsent me by Mrs. Piper, of an internal trouble from which I had suffered for\neighteen months.\n[\"M.N.\"]\nI hereby corroborate the above statements.\n[\u2022\u2022Mrs. M. N.\"]\n35. Mr. and Mrt. T. About June, 1888.\n[From Mrs. T. Detroit, June 3rd, 1889.]\nIn response to the request contained in your note of May 27th, I will\ngive you as full an account as possible, knowing that you desire the facts for\nscientific reasons alone.\n\f122 Mr. H. Hodgson.\nMr. T. or myself had never seen Mrs. Piper, but we had heard of your\nSociety, and that you used her mediumistic power for the purposes of inves\ntigation. For that one reason, and that alone, I had sufficient confidence to\nwish to consult her. I am not a believer in the generally so-called medium,\nand previous to our visit to Mrs. P. had been an absolute sceptic We were\nvisiting in Taunton ; took the early train to Boston, and left on the 3 p.m.\ntrain for Detroit. We reached Mrs. Piper's shortly after 9 a.m. She was\nan absolute stranger to us, as we were strangers to her, meeting her then for\nthe first time. My husband introduced himself and me as Mr. and Mrs. T.T\nand requested a sitting, which she declined to give, having an appointment\nat 9.30. We were urgent for the sitting, and she yielded sufficiently to say that\nif we desired to wait, and the parties failed to keep the appointment, she\nwould give us the time. We waited and secured the sitting. Nothing was\naid of ourselves\u2014we were there to test her power. I had lost a very dear\naunt in November, and my loved father had gone on in May. Grief-\nstricken under the double bereavement, 1 was soul-hungry for some word\u2014\nif word or sign were possible. Mrs. P. could not know of this, for we do\nnot believe in mourning robes, and I wore not a particlo of black.\nYou am, therefore, imagine my astonishment when, after Mrs. P. was\nunder control, and the greeting by the little French doctor (the voice was\nthat of a brisk old man and a foreigner ; he introduced himself as Dr.\nFindlay, or such a name ; said he was French), wc were greeted by our\nChristian names of Frank and Mary, and told there was a lady there who\nwas so glad to see us and wanted to speak with us ; her name was Mary\u2014\n(hesitating on the surname, but giving it correctly). \"She is not strong\nyet, and will speak to you through mc. She left you so suddenly\u2014she\nscarcely realised it, and it was a great grief to her to leave her children.\nShe is still weak, but is gaining strength. She knows now it was all for\nthe best. She asks, ' How are my dear children, Mary ? Don't let them\nforget me. I want them to feel I am ever near them, and tell Cyrenius\n(her husband) not to grieve so\u2014that all is well, and that the babe is with\nme and our other children. Tell him I could not be reconciled to it at first,\nbut now I know it is best, and I am happy here. I havo tried so hard to\nmake myself known to you at home, but could not. I am often there, and\nsee the home life going on, and see your care of them . Mary\u2014and you,\nFrank\u2014you were so kind and thoughtful, and I love and thank you both.\nOh, Mary ! I've seen my own dear mother's face and been with her ; and\nyou know, Mary, how I have longed to know her,'f &c I then asked, Did\nyou want me to stay with the children, aunt Mary? \"That has been part\nof my happiness here.\"\nThe doctor then said, \"The lady is tired and must rest awhile.\" He\ndescribed her perfectly, even to a peculiar motion of the hand, and spoke of\nmuch pertaining to the home and of persons in my husband's family and my\nown, calling each one by Christian name\u2014describing them or saying some\nthing of each one\u2014of at least fifteen or twenty individuals. He spoke so\nrapidly, and of so many, I became confused, and from surprise was dumb-\nfoundered. Then he said, ' ' Here comes a gentleman who wants to speak to\nyou. Ho is hurrying and motioning to me. Why, what's the matter with\nhim ? He is lame\u2014the left leg is drawn up as if from rheumatism.\" (My\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 123\nfather slipped on the ice six weeks before his death, and had broken his left\nleg below the hip ; the bone did not knit, and it was several inches shorter\nthan the right.) \"It's your father, Frank.\" \" No, not my father, \"said my\nhusband. \" I tell you it is your father. \" \" It is my father, \" said I. \"Well,\nit is your father any way.\" Then came the greeting from my father and a\ndescription of the life there, and of his first day there, and that his only\nunhappiness was that he could not tell me how well it was with him. He had\nfound so many of his friends there\u2014his father and mother and my mother.\nHe spoke of the home here and of my step-mother, and of much known to\nhim alone. He spoke of the life at some length and in words and manner\npeculiar to himself. My father had been a great student, with an intense\nlove of books, and always expressed his thoughts with a piquant, caustic,\nready eloquence, as rare as it was peculiar to himself. Anyone who had\never heard my father speak could not mistake the beautiful and rounded\nphraseology of his address to us. It could be no one but my father.\nDr. F. then said the old gentleman was weary and must rest, but he was\nso glad to have seen us. Dr. F. then spoke of my sisters and others,\nand of circumstances about us, and asked if we had any questions. I had\nreceived so much more than I had anticipated that I could think of no\nquestion to ask. I must have time to think it all over. What did it\nmean ? It could not be mental transference. Dr. F. had talked rapidly\nand steadily for more than an hour without the slightest hesitation, and of\npersons and things some of whom were far from our thoughts.\nAll of the foregoing that I have written, as given us, was true in every\nparticular. I cannot explain it in any material way.\nMaey E. T.\n[From Mr. T.]\nDetroit, June 12th, 1889.\nAs you request a statement from me, I will answer the items in your\nletter instead of my wife.\nOn our way to Taunton, a year ago, wc stopped in Boston a few hours,\nand called at Mrs. Piper's house, hoping for a sitting. She was out, and I\nleft a card with my name signed, as it will be at the end of this letter,\nasking her to name an hour she would give us during the coming week. The\nname was written hastily with a lead pencil, and in an awkward position\nwhile standing at the door. I did not hear from her, so on our return to\nBoston, on our way home, we called on her again. She said she had not\nbeen able to read my name and therefore had not answered the note. We\nwaited a long time for others to come who had engaged the time, talking\nmore or less on general subjects. I told her my surname and that we lived\nin Detroit, but nothing more. From the initial F. she might have guessed\nthat my name was Frank, but she could not have gotten at it in any other\nway. My wife's first name she could not have known, as we were careful\nnot to address each other before the sitting by our given names. Almost\nthe first words, if not the first ones, after she went into the trance state,\nwere \" Frank and Mary, I am glad to see you.\" During the sitting she\nmentioned fully twenty relatives and friends, all but one or two of whose\nnames w\u00abre- given without mistake, and most of them without hesitation.\nThe name of Cyrenius troubled her, but was given finally without our help .\n\f124 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nMary Newcomb\u2014the name you ask for\u2014she also stumbled over somewhat.\nThe point that made the strongest impression on both of us was the message\nthat came from my wife's father. He was a man of strong personality, and\nmany peculiarities of speech. The message seemed as though he were\nspeaking, and in nearly his natural voice ; it was so natural that we both\nwere startled.\nF. N. T.\n36. Miss Lilian Whiting. January 4th, 1889.\n[Appointment made by R. H., but Miss Whiting had made one or two\nprevious attempts to have a sitting with Mrs. Piper, to whom her name was\nknown.]\nThe Brunswick, Boston, January 5th, 1889.\nMy sitting with Mrs. Piper yesterday was one of curious and satisfactory\ninterest. As a test I asked her to describe my rooms at the Brunswick. This\nwas done in several particulars. One thing described was a photograph of\nthe novelist, Edgar Fawcett. \"What does that man do?'' I inquired.\n\"He writes books,\" was the reply. In my room are several pictures of\nMiss Kate Field. This was noted by the medium as \" so many pictures of\none lady\u2014oh, a great many ! \" \"Tell me about that lady,\" I said. \"She\nappears before the public in some way. Yes, I see ! she lectures. She has\na very strong intellect\u2014a brilliant mind. One of these pictures I do not\nlike. It is not good of her. You should put it away. Turn the back to the\nwall.\" [This is true ; the largest picture I have of Miss Field being one that\ndoes her injustice.]\nThe prophecy was made that I should go abroad within a year to remain\nindefinitely, and that hereafter my life would be spent mainly in England.\nThe place was described ; a country estate, north of London. We can see\nwhether this will be verified. At this time nothing could seem more\nimprobable and all but impossible to me. This I said to the medium, stating\nthat I had not money enough to dream of doing such a thing, but she replied\nthat it would come.\nMy writing methods and many personal details were correctly given.\nLilian Whiting.\nJuly 7th, 1890.\nGlancing at the proof copy of the above, for which I am greatly Indebted\nto your courtesy, may I add that the prophecy of my going abroad has not\nbeen fulfilled ; but that circumstances occurred, after my sitting with Mrs.\nPiper, which were entirely undreamed of by me previously, and which\nwould have resulted in almost a literal fulfilment of the prophecy, only pre\nvented by an equally unlooked-for event ? That is, the prophecy nearly\n.approached completion, but did not reach it.\nI had a subsequent sitting for a friend\u2014with a lock of hair and regarding\nan illness. Mrs. Piper described the person more vividly than I could have\n.done, and prescribed a medicine that proved highly efficacious. . . .\nLilian Whiting.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 125'\n37. Mr. \"CD.\" May 3rd, 1889.\nMr. \"C. D.,\" a student of psychology, went to Mrs. Piper under im\nassumed name. He recorded the sitting immediately afterwards, and it was a\nvery successful one on the whole, many correct statements being made about\nMr. \" C. D.,\" his family, and acquaintances,\u2014all matters known to Mr.\n\" C. D.\" There were a few mistakes, and some attempts at prophecy which\nwere failures.\n38. Dr. C L . October 3Ut, 1889.\n[Appointment made by me. But I believe that Dr. L had called\non Mrs. Piper previously, and had given his name.\u2014B. H.]\nBoston, November 9th, 1889.\nI saw Mrs. Piper October 31st. She did not know me before.\nShe reminded me of an accident by which I, as a seven-year-old boy, was\nvery nearly drowned. It is very seldom that my thoughts occupy themselves,\nwith the incident. I did not at the time fully realise the danger.\nThe trance person and I spoke French two or three times during the\nsitting. He did not seem to be desirous of talking it a long time. He\nwould very soon translate my answer into English, and then go on in\nEnglish.\nAsked if he could tell me which gentlemen I had dined with the previous\nday, he described both of them in a surprisingly accurate way, their appear\nance as well as their character.\nHe told me how many we were at home, described my sister, and gave\neven her name, Marie. She is in Norway.\nHe saw me surrounded by books and papers.\nHe told me that my stomach and nervous system had been broken down,\nand described my illness at the time very well.\nI have been trying to press my brain for more, but I think this is about\nall of any.importance that resulted of the sitting.\nQ L .\nNovember 20th.\nIn conversation Dr. L\u2014\u2014 told me that Mrs. Piper in trance said nothing\nthat was incorrect.\nR. H.\n39. Mrs. 0. H. Browne.\n[March 5th, 1891.]\nMrs. Browne (nee Webster) wrote her account early in March, 1891. Her\nfirst sitting was about July 22nd, 1886. I abridge her statements.\n\"Mrs. D ,who sewed almost daily at the house of Mr. R , where I\nlived, had told me the story (No. 28, from Miss E. R. Webster) which I sent\nyou, and also that Professor James was interested in Mrs. P. and Miss\nR , 'Cora,' and I determined to go to her. No one but Miss R.'s\nsister knew our intention.\" Mrs. Piper consented to sit for one of them and\nMrs. Browne took the sitting.\n\"The first words she uttered in her 'trance voice' were: 'It is Dr.\nFinnee ' (I spell it as she pronounced it, the accent was decidedly on the\n\f126 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nlast syllable, but the t e ' was not the French one), ' who is talking to\nyou.' I did not understand and she repeated it twice, always the same\npronunciation.\"\nPhinuit talked about \" Otto,' who was in Europe at the time, and\ncalled him Her-r-r , and said : \" You will marry in two and a-half years.\nYou will marry Herr.\" [I was married in a little more than three years, but\nnot to Herr.] Phinuit described two other men and gave their names\ncorrectly, George and Fred. He called Mrs. Browne Elmily from the first,\nand kept apologising for mispronouncing it ; Emily being her first name.\n\"The next day, after my first sitting, Miss R. went to see her, but got\nnothing new, I believe.\"\nThe second sitting was probably in the fall of 1886. Phinuit got the\nname \" Oscar Zinkeisen,\" known to Mrs. Browne, but wrongly said that he\nwas older than she was.\nPhinuit spoke of a man named \" Frank Tarbelle.\" He was an acquaint\nance of \" Cora's,\" and Mrs. Browne had never met him.\n1 ' In fact, much of what Mrs. Piper said to me was exactly the sort of\nthing one might dream ; queer mixtures of things perfectly natural, and\nthings too silly to repeat ; slight suggestions magnified, and constant reitera\ntion of points which took her fancy ; astonishing accuracy in much, and\nvery little that could be shown to be absolutely wrong.\"\n\"I have not the slightest recollection of the date of my third sitting. I\nthink, however, it was four years ago next spring. Mrs. P. sat for both\nMiss R. and me.\n\"We took the hair of two friends. \" Cora \" had both in one compartment\nof her purse, and when she gave the first lock to Mrs. P. the latter com\nplained that it had been with other hair which she demanded, saying she\ncould make nothing out of lock No. 1. On receiving lock No. 2 she imme\ndiately described the original of No. 1, giving an estimate of his character\nentirely coinciding with mine. While she was pressing these locks to her\nforehead, she seized my hand and held it forcibly (part of the time to her\nforehead) while she described the owners of the locks. I have forgotten\nwhether she told the name of lock No. 1, but No. 2\u2014whom she described\nmost fully\u2014was \" Bertram Ellis.\" You will notice that she mentioned him in\nMr. Browne's sitting. 1 am very certain that she spoke of him the first or\nsecond time I went, though I find nothing of it in the notes I took. Mr.\nEllis was a friend of Mr. Browne's, and a man whose distinguishing\ncharacteristics were very easy to describe. It was evident that his influence\nwas the stronger of the two. . . .\"\nEmily W. Buownk.\n40. Mr. J. Rogers Rich.\nThe following report has been made from contemporary notes of the sit\ntings. On the day of each sitting I made notes in m.y diary of all the important\npoints. There was much repetition at my sittings, and a few other matters\nwere referred to, especially concerning the landing of my ancestors in\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 127\nAmerica, which I have not had the opportunity yet either to prove or\ndisprove.\nHaving frequently heard of the remarkable things said to be done by Mrs.\nPiper, I finally persuaded myself to call on her. I had always had a dislike\nfor any \" mediums \" or \"spiritualists \" of every kind, but on meeting this\nwoman I was at once attracted to her by the simple and sympathetic manner\nwhich she showed on greeting me, and I felt a delicacy about making\nan appointment for a sitting, she seeming to me too gentle and refined for a\nbusiness of this sort. I was at once struck with the peculiar light, or inward\nlook, in her eyes. Her voice was full and agreeable, but in every way a\n*' feminine \" voice, and there was an entire absence of any masculinity in her\nmAnner, which I had been expecting to find under the circumstances.\nMy first sitting with her was on September Cth, 1888. With little\ntrouble she went into the trance\u2014a state which was entirely new to my\nexperience\u2014and after a moment's silence, which followed her rather violent\nmovements, I was stwtled by the remirkable change in her voice\u2014an\nexclamation, a sort of grunt of satisfaction, as if the person had reached his\ndestination and gave vent to his pleasure thereat by this sound, uttered in\nan unmistakably male voice, but rather husky. I was at once addressed in\nFrench with, \" Bonjour, Monsieur, comment vous portez vous ? \" to\nwhich I gave answer in the same language, with which I happen to be\nperfectly familiar. My answer was responded to with a sort of inquiring\ngrunt, much like the French \" Hein ? \" and then the conversation\ncontinued in English, with rarely a French word, and more rarely a\nFrench expression coming into it. Nearly all my interviews were begun\nin the same manner. I had given no means of identification, and simply\nawaited results. At the time I made my first visits to Mrs. Piper I was\nquite unwell with nervous troubles, for which I had been under treatment\nby a noted specialist. The first thing told me was of a \"great light behind\nme, a good sign,\" &c. Then suddenly all my ills were very clearly and dis\ntinctly explained and so thoroughly that I felt certain that Mrs. Piper\nherself would have hesitated to use such plain language ! Prescriptions\nwere given to me for the purchase of herbs, and the manner of preparing\nthem, which I was to do myself. I speak of this now, as I shall have\noccasion to refer to it farther on. My profession (painting) was described,\nand my particular talents and mannerisms in design were mentioned. I was\nsurrounded with pictures\u2014\"Oh ! pictures everywhere ! \" At this interview\nmy mother was clearly described ! She was \" beside me, dressed as in her\nportrait (painted a year or two before her death), and wearing a certain cameo\npin, the portrait of my father.\" Two living aunts, who are very dear to me,\nmy brother and his wife \" Nellie \" were well described, and in such a way\nas to have made it impossible for Mrs. Piper to have so minutely informed\nherself about them.\nSecond Sitting, mt October nth.\u2014Mention was made of an old friend whom\nI had lost sight of for a long time, last hearing of him in a mining camp in\nSouthern California. He (\"Dr. Phinuit \") suddenly said: \"You will hear\nin a few months from Lennox\u2014you call him 'Frank.' He is doing well and\nis prosperous.\" On my asking where he was, if still in California, he said,\n\" No,\" but had \"gone across water to Al\u2014Aul\u2014Aula\u2014how you call that ?\"\n\f128 Mr. JR. Hodgson.\nI suggested \" Australia,\" which seemed to puzzle the good \"Doctor\" for he\ndoubted the name, hesitated, but finally said, \"Yes, Australia.\" Within a\nyear afterwards I received very unexpectedly a letter from this friend, then\nin Florida, saying that he had been mining in Alaska and mot with some\nsuccess and was at the moment of writing doing better than ever before. At\nthis sitting the \"Doctor\" told me of my niece being frequently \"in my\nsurroundings,\" and that she was then at my side. Up to this time I had not\nheard my name mentioned so I asked of it from my niece. The \" Doctor \" was\nagain puzzled and said, \" What a funny name\u2014wait, I cannot go so fast ! \"\nThen my entire name was correctly spelled out but entirely with the French\nalphabet, each separate, lotter being clearly pronounced in that language.\nMy niece had been born, livod most of her short life, and died in France.\nThen the attempt to pronounce my name was amusing\u2014finally calling me\n\"Thames Rowghearce Reach.\" The \" Doctor \" never called me after that\nanything but \" Reach.\" I speak hereof the pronunciation of my name as\nI will later on refer to it again. Was told of the arrival in this country of my\npaternal ancestors from Scotland in the middle of the last century, and the\nfamily name was correctly given as Richie, but I have not as yet verified the\naccounts of then- settling here as the \"Doctor\" gave me, and which differ\nmuch from family traditions. On placing in Mrs. Piper's hands the marriage\nregister of my grandfather, she gave a very minute description of it, although\nshe could not possibly have seen it or its contents. Phinuit said there were\nlots of people's names\u2014it was a marriage\u2014a blood-relation\u2014my grandfather\nand grandmother. This was all correct ; the certificate was of a Quaker\nmarriage, and signed by a large number of persons.\nNovetnber 6th, 1888.\u2014My sitting on this date was quite remarkable. A\nfriend's sister had met with a loss by fire, and wished to see what could be\ndone towards tracing the incendiary. This lady had a habit of colouring or\nbleaching her hair, of which she had sent a lock as a test. \"Dr.\nPhinuit\" at first refused to touch the hair, saying that it was \"dead and\ndevilish!\" As I knew nothing whatever of the persons connected with the\nfire, I noted down the descriptions given, which tallied perfectly with that of\nthe parties suspected, as I afterwards learned. At this sitting a remarkable\nincident happened. Breaking into the run of conversation, the \"Doctor\" of\na sudden said, \"Hullo, here's Newell ! \" (mentioning the name of a friend\nwho had died some months before). \" Newell \" is a substitute for the real\nname. I should add that \"Newell \" had frequently purported to com\nmunicate directly with his mother through Mrs. Piper at previous sittings,\nbut this was the first time that any intimation of his presence was given to\nme. I was totally unprepared for this, and said, \" Who did you say?\" Tho\nname was repeated with a strong foreign accent, and in the familiar voice and\ntone of the \"Doctor.\" Then there seemed for a moment to be a mingling\nof voices as if in dispute, followed by silence and heavy breathing of the\nmedium. All at once I was astonished to hear, in an entirely different tone\nand in the purest English accent, \" Well, of all persons under the sun,\nRogers Rich, what brought you here ? I'm glad to see you, old fellow ? How\nis X and Y and Z, and all the boys at tho club ? \" Some names were given\nwhich I knew of, but their owners I had never met, and so reminded my\nfriend \" Newell,\" who recalled that he followed me in college by some years\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 129\nami that all his acquaintances were younger than I. I remarked an odd\nmovement of the medium while under this influence ; she apparently was\ntwirling a moustache, a trick which my friend formerly practised much.\n\" Newell \" also told me that his cousin was then visiting his brother, a fact\nwhich I afterwards learned to be true.\nDecember 3rd, 1888.\u2014I had my fifth sitting with Mrs. Piper, but the result\nwas not remarkably interesting, being mostly devoted to family affairs and-\ncertain friends who were perfectly described. All this time I had been using\nthe medicines given me by the \" Doctor,\" and generally with the best results.\nAt this sitting he changed the prescription.\nDecember 29th, 1888.\u2014This sitting, similar to my. last one, was interesting\nin its relation to private family affairs, and some remarkable descriptions o\nthese.\nJanuary Sid, 1889.\u2014My seventh sitting was amusing in one thing. I\nhad been following the treatment prescribed by the \"Doctor,\" and had\nprepared at my home the herbs, ifcc, according to his orders, as I thought.\nBut I found that the medicine had not the effect promised and so told him.\nThe answer was that it was my fault for \" they were not properly prepared.\"\nI assured him that they were, whereat he said that \" that old nigger \" (refer\nring to a respectable coloured cook in my employ at the time) '' had not followed\nmy directions, had used the wrong proportions, had forgotten to watch the\ncooking, and was a fool any way ! \" On inquiry I found this to be the fact,\nfor she had understood me to say a quart instead of a pint, and confessed to\nhaving forgotten the mixture and allowed it to boil down but \" thought it\nwouldn't make any difference ! \" I took a piece of embroidery made by a\nsailor while abroad on a cruise and at once \" An old, wizened-up man \" came\nto its influence. \" Who is he ? \" \" Why, D.'s grandfather,\" giving me the\ncorrect name of my friend but one by which I had never known him, but\nwhich I only knew after an acquaintance of a year or more, he having\nfollowed the sea, as usual with sailors, under an assumed name.\nMarch 26th, 1889.\u2014My eighth sitting. A test was given me by a friend\nof which I knew nothing. The article was placed in cotton wool within a\nbox, wrapped in paper and tied with a string. The \"Doctor\" said he\n\" could see it,\" and described the object fairly well, but said that if I would\nopen the box he could tell just where it came from. I had no idea what was\nin the box, and the box was not opened until I returned it to my friend. As\nit was, he described well my friend X, who gave me the parcel ; then he\ndescribed his friend Y, who had given the article, the person who gave Y the\narticle from \"far off over the sea,\" and explained certain characteristics of\nthese persons and their connection with my friend X. All of these descrip\ntions, X afterwards told me, were correct, and the article which the \"Doctor\"\ndescribed as a \" charm,\" and \"glittering,\" proved to be a beautifully carved,\nbut not \"glittering,\" button, latterly worn as a charm with a gold attach\nment, formerly in the possession of a noble Japanese family of great\nantiquity, and surreptitiously taken from there by a visitor and brought to\nthis country. A lock of hair belonging to a friend who is quite noted for his.\namusing self-conceit was greeted with a laugh and recognised as belonging\nto \" Hi\u00bb Royal Highness,\" or the \" Duke B,\" calling him by his real name\nand attaching the titles by way of \" chaff.\"\nK\n\f130 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nSome prophecies were made to \" occur soon,\" but I regret to say that the\n' ' Doctor's \" idea of '' soonness \" and mine differ greatly\u2014for they are not yet\nfulfilled.\nJune 3rd, 1889.\u2014My ninth sitting. This time I asked to communicate\nwith my friend \" Newell,\" previously referred to in my fourth sitting. The\n\" Doctor \" said, \" I'll send for him,\" and kept on talking with me for a while.\nThen he said, \"Here's Newell, and he wants to talk with you 'Reach,' so\nI'll go about my business whilst you are talking with him, and will come back\nagain later.\" Then followed a confusion of words, but I clearly heard the\nvoice of the \" Doctor\" saying: \" Here, Newell, you come by the hands while\nI go out by the feet,\" which apparently being accomplished in the proper\nmanner, my name was called clearly as \" Rogers, old fellow ! \" without a sign\nof accent, and the same questions put as to how were the \"fellows at the\nclub.\" My hand was cordially shaken, and I remarked the same movement\nof twisting the moustache, which was kept up by Mrs. Piper during the inter\nview. \" Newell \" spoke of a \"pastel\" which I was drawing as a wedding\npresent, and described the pleasure he had in watching me do it. He told\nme of certain private family affairs which I knew to be correct. Finally he\nbade me good-bye. Before going he spoke to me of his \" present life,\" and\ntold me that he was writing a poem ; that he was now pursuing his literary\nstudies with the greatest pleasure, &c, &c. \"But,\" he said, \"was I not\nsick, and did I not suffer before I left you all ? Why, the leaving of the\nmaterial body, Rogers, is terrible. It is like tearing limb from limb ; but\nonce free, how happy one is.\" When \"Newell\" left me there was the usual\ndisturbance in the medium's condition, and then the resumption of the\namiliar voice, accent and mannerisms of Dr. Phinuit.\nThen I produced a dog's collar. After some handling of it the \" Doctor\"\nrecognised it as belonging to a dog which I had once owned. I asked \"If\nthere were dogs where he was?\" \"Thousands of them ! \" and he said he\nwould try to attract the attention of my dog with this collar. In the midst\nof our conversation he suddenly exclaimed, \"There ! I think he knows you\nare here, for I see [him] coming from away off ! \" He then described my collie\nperfectly, and said, \" You call him, Reach,\" and I gave my whistle by which\nI used to call him. \"Here he comes ! Oh, how he jumps ! There he is now,\njumping upon and around you. So glad to see you ! Rover ! Rover ! No\u2014\nG-rover, Grover ! That's his name ! \" The dog was once called Rover, but\nhis name was changed to Grover in 1884, in honour of the election of\nGrover Cleveland.\nJuly 12th, 1889.\u2014My tenth sitting. This was of little interest outside\nof certain affairs which the good \" Doctor \" talked about. I tried no tests\nand had no experiences.\nJuly 17th, 1889.\u2014My eleventh sitting. The \"Doctor\" this time gave\nme his full name, &c, as follows :\u2014\n\" Dr. Jean Phinuit Scliville, 113 or 115, Rue Dupuytren, Paris. Ami\ndu Docteur Latimer.\" This was my last sitting with Mrs. Piper before she\nwent to England. It was again of little or no interest to report about.\nAmong other curious things told me by the \" Doctor \" was the following :\nA child was constantly beside me and in my surroundings. It was attracted to\nme and had much influence over me: \"It is a blood relation, a sister.\" I\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 131\ndenied this to have ever been a fact for I never had a sister and never heard\nof one. The answer came : \" I know that, you were never told of it. The\nbirth was premature, the child dead, born some years before you were. Go\nand ask your aunts to prove it.\" On questioning an aunt who had been\nalways a member of our family, I learned that such had been the case, and\nthat by the time I came into the world the affair had been forgotten and\nthere had never been a reason for informing me of the circumstances,\nproving that I in no way had any intimation of it, and that this communica\ntion could not be explained by thought-transference or the like.\nAlthough the \"prophecies\" of the \"Doctor \"were not fulfilled at the\ntime I understood him to mean as \"in the spring\" or \"in the fall,\" I have\nsince found several of these things come true, and in the season which he\nmentioned, but not that year in which he led me to expect them to be\nrealised.\nOne day Mrs. Piper pointed to a plain gold ring on my finger and said :\n\" C'est une alliance, how you call that ? A wedding ring, n'est-ce pas ?\" This\nwas true. Now if Mrs. Piper had learned French at school here she would\nmost probably have called this ring \" un anneau de marriage,\" and not have\ngiven it the technical name \"alliance.\" I several times carried on a short\nconversation in French, making my observations in that language and\nreceiving answers in the same, but which were always curt, and ended with\nan expressed wish in broken English not \"to bodder about French but to\nspeak in English.\" I made use, too, of certain slang expressions which were\napparently perfectly understood but answered in English, though correctly.\nJ. Rogers Rich.\n167, Tremont-street, Boston, Mass.\nApril Uth, 1891.\n41. R. Hodgson. Locks of Hair.\nI knew nothing concerning the first five locks of hair, but did know\nfrom whom the hair came in the sixth case. The first five cases were\ncomplete failures. In the sixth case perhaps there is no more than can\nbe accounted for by chance. I did not know to whom the hair sent to\nme in the seventh case belonged. It was sent to me from Albany,\nN.Y., wrapped, at my request, in rubber cloth. I took it out of the\ncloth before giving it to Phinuit, and saw that it was white.\n1-5. Locks of hair sent from England, tried in March, 1888. Complete\nfailures. While holding lock 5 Phinuit said : \" Here's a spirit named\nJ . Something very sad about it. And I can see two little boys and\na girl here, and there's a person named Alice in the family.\" [This apparently\nindependent of the hair.

He has a daughter in the body who was very\nmuch devoted to him. Henry\u2014still in the body. I'll have to take this\nanother time. John calls for Henry and says : \" Don't worry about Charles.\nLet him take his own course and all will be right. Don't oppose.

There's somebody named Carter connected with this. There's very little\ninfluence in this. It's nearly gone. It belongs to somebody who has passed\nout of the body.\n[Mrs. S., who sent me the hair, writes as follows :\u2014\" Yes. The friend has\npassed out of the body. He was an old man of 90, and a remarkably\ngenial, lovable man. John is not right. The old gentleman's name was\nWilliam, and John is not a family name.

There is a relative of the old gentleman who\nhas a disease at present that makes her delirious much of the time, but there's\nno insanity anywhere in the family. He died of heart failure and had a lung\nand throat trouble. Yes, he was very deaf. Yes, he has a daughter living\nwho was exceedingly devoted to him. All that about Henry, and John calling\nfor Henry, and what he says has nothing to do with the old gentleman, but\n\" not been passed out so very long \" is true. The old gentleman died only\nthe middle of last April. Yes, he was very fond of music. On the second\ndate, June 23rd, there is almost nothing. John is not the right name, nor\nis there any such name as Carter connected with the family. The old\ngentleman was my grandfather, who died only two months ago. Some of the\nthings were strikingly true. He was deaf, fond of music, and had this one\ndaughter (my mother) who was passionately devoted to him.\"]\nThe remaining records are of sittings given by Mrs. Piper since her\nreturn from England. (See also last part of No. 41.)

Sitting on December 4th, 1890.\nThe first sitting given by Mrs. Piper since her return (February,\n1890) to America was in the presence of her physician and Professor\nWilliam James and a stenographic reporter. Unfortunately, as I have\nalready mentioned (see p. 5), her physician has refused to make any\nreport whatever. An incident, however, occurred at the sitting having\nreference to some relations of Professor James, and I give the account\nof it here, with additional statements in explanation.\n[Extracts from stenographic report of sitting.]\nP. : You are not the captain. You are William. I know you ; you are\nJames. I am glad to see you. Do you know the\u2014the\u2014the\u2014little one ? J. :\nWhich little one ? P. : A little one, Eliza.

[No answer ; makes\nmotion of drawing it away.] P. : William 1 J. : Yes. P. : The last thing\nthat the little one remembers is the knife ; the knife ; her papa opened the\nknife. She asked him to open the knife. That is the last thing she says she\nremembers. J. : What did she die of ? P. : [Taking hold of J.'s necktie.]\nDiphtheria. She got that of a lady.

[J. hands knife.] P. : William, I want to ask you\nif you know this little one is very small ? Will you find out what she means\nby the knife ? J. : I will. P. : She says something about William\u2014that is\npapa\u2014to open the knife. J. : Does she want him to open it now or does she\nsay that she did ? P. : She wanted him to open it, I believe ; I can't tell you\nexactly ; that is the last thing she remembers. Do you know anything about\nit ? J. : No, I don't know anything about it.

Salter to his wife.\u2014W.J.]\n516, North-avenue, Chicago, December 9th, 1890.\nDear William,\u2014-We are greatly obliged for the account of the sitting\nwith Mrs. Piper. Baby Eliza did play with my knife, and asked me to open\nit but a short time before she died\u2014indeed, it was the last show of intelligence\nthat I distinctly remember. I have told this incident to many people, and\nthe whole question is whether in any way it could have got to Mrs. Piper.\nMargaret thinks she did not tell her, but she is not absolutely sure. If Mrs.\nPiper had not heard of it in any way it is certainly remarkable.\n[From Mr. W. M. Salter.]\nChicago, December 17th, 1890.\nDear William,\u2014Mrs. Piper stumbled (with my assistance) on to my\nsister Mary's name a year ago in Chocorua. The first name she used then\nwas \" Lizzie, \" and who was meant I could not say. I have a living aunt whose\nmiddle name is Elizabeth, but she is never called Lizzie. \" Emily \" I do not\nrecognise at all\u2014have never known or heard of an Emily in our family. If I\ncould only bo sure Mtrgaret had not told Mm. Piper of the knife incident !\nWm. Salter.\n[From Mrs. W. M. Salter.]\nChicago, December 17th, 1890.\nDear William,\u2014We were very glad to get your letter with the steno\ngraphic report of the Piper interview. I hope that you will not object to our\nkeeping it. I am ready to swear, if necessary, that I did not tell Mrs. Piper\nof the knife incident when I went to see her last October with mother. I\nrecall clearly the whole interview. And, indeed, my baby's illness is some\nthing I can speak of to no one. Time for me only adds to its pathos.\n*****\nMary G. Salter.\nP.S.\u2014I think there is small chance of Margaret's having told Mrs. Piper\nthe incident of the knife. She says that her first impulse was to deny\nabsolutely having done so. Almost the whole interview was taken up with\nMrs. Piper's account of her English experiences. Towards the close she\nreferred to Baby's death. Because Margie cannot remember just what she\nsaid she is unable to positively assert anything in regard to it.\u2014Yours,\nM. G. S.\n[Statement by Professor James.]\nIt seems unlikely that so interesting an incident as that of the knife could\nhave been mentioned to Mrs. P. by Margaret G. in the few minutes' talk\nwhich she could have had about the death of \"Eliza.\" It was more likely to\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 135\nhave been mentioned to me, but if so, it has sunk to an unrecoverable part\nof my consciousness.\nMrs. P. saw \"Eliza\" when at Chocorua in 1889. She saw Margaret once,\nsoon after her return from England, and Mary Salter and Mrs. Gibbens\ntogether once, in October last.\n[W. J.]\n[Statement by Mrs. Piper.]\nDecember 22nd, 1890.\nMrs. Piper states that neither Mrs. Gibbens nor Mrs. Salter nor Miss\nGibbens said anything whatever to her concerning any knife incident in\nconnection with Eliza. Mrs. Salter made one reference only to Eliza during\nher conversation in the fall, viz. : \" I thought I might get a word from Baby.\"\nThis impressed Mr3. Piper because Mrs. Salter was much affected when she\nmade this remark. Miss Gibbens on a prior visit talked more freely about\nEliza and the grief which Mrs. Salter felt, but said no more about the details\nof the death than Mrs. Piper had learned in England from Mr. Clarke, who\nhad told her that the child was dead and that the cause of death was\ndiphtheria. Mrs. Piper is not quite sure whether he said diphtheria or\nscarlet fever.\n[R. H.]\nMrs. Salter writes on December 27th, 1890 :\u2014\nWhen I saw Mrs. Piper she talked almost exclusively about her own\naffairs. I merely referred to my child's death when I asked her for a sitting,\notherwise I said nothing about it.\n43. Miss Edmunds. June 1st, 1891.\n[From notes made during the sitting by Miss Edmunds.]\n[Mrs. Piper knew my name ; that I was English; had seen me at the office\nof the S.P.R. ; and, during the conversation we had before the sitting, I had\nmade a passing allusion to a nephew ; beyond these facts I think that she\nknew nothing of me. (This nephew was not alluded to during the sitting.)\nThe following account is an abridgment.]\nPhinuit stated that I had a father in spirit and mother in body,\ndescribing some characteristics of each one. . . . John\u2014no, Joseph\u2014\nJoseph. [Father and mother each had a brother named Joseph, both\ndeceased.] There's one, two, three, four brothers.

[James Henry Thomas, whom we have always called \" Uncle\nHenry.\" But father used to call him \"James Henry.\"] There's a little\none, came after he [father] passed out. [True.] Al\u2014Alice, another little\ngirl. (Not Alice.) [Forgetting for the moment that Lillie's name is Alice\nLilian, and that my brother usually calls her Alice and writes to her as such.]\nYes, Alice. You call her Lil, but she's Alice! [Phinuit enumerated the\ngirls in the family correctly, giving the name \" Ethel, musical,\" and stating\nthat one was in Australia, summing up :] There's yourself, one married,\n\f136 Mr. R. Hodgson.\none in Australia, one that studies, one that paints, and the two little ones.\n[My older brother was wrongly said to be married. Ellen, the name of a\nlittle sister who died in infancy, was referred to as sending a message, and\nas being \" a big girl now.\" Mary was mentioned and \" Aunt Ellen.\" Mary\nand Ellen were great aunts.]\n[Here Phinuit made a sudden dart at my watchcord, and I thought of his\n\"scent for trinkets \" as he pulled out a heart-shaped locket made of the ser\npentine rocks at the Land's End, which had been in my possession since a\nchild.] Ha ! You had that a long time, since you little girl\u2014rock\u2014sea\nwashed over that. Your mother's influence comes with that\u2014no, your\nmother's mother\u2014your grandmother. [True.] [Takes the watch from\nthe other end of the cord.] School watch f No, you iuit had that so\nlong as this. [Holding up the locket.] Ask me something else\u2014I'll\ntell you about the watch presently. [Pause.] No, your father knows\nthat,\u2014se\u00ab, I hold it up and he say, \"Oh, I know that.\" [Phinuit\nholds up the watch as if to show it to some invisible person behind him.]\nHe gave it to your aunt, and she gave it to you. [True.] Box, oh, box,\nhe knows that ! [I had token from my pocket a little round black box\nwhich father used to keep in his desk, full of old coins.] (What was in\nit?) [It was then empty.] Oh, I'll tell you presently. I can't hear what\nhe says. [Looking over his shoulder as though listening to someone behind\nhim, while I mentally said, \"Coins, coins,\" and formed a distinct picture\nof them in my mind.] Picture, where's picture f [Working his finger round\na hole in the lid where I believe at one time was a picture under glass.]\nBut you don't know.

Edmunds.\nJuly 1st, 1891. (See also No. 50, p. 154.) [Mrs. Holmes present.\nL. E. taking notes.]\n*****\n[Once Phinuit turned to me with :] How's Catherine ? (Who is Catherine ?)\nYou know\u2014your sister\u2014the one whose name I did not give you last time.\n[I had not mentioned to Phinuit that he had omitted to give the name of one\nsister, although I had made a note of the fact.] (I have no sister named\nCatherine.) Yes, you have. (Not Catherine, but Kate.) It's Catherine,\nthat's what your father told me. (That's funny, for father disliked the name of\nCatherine, and took special pains to register the name of my sister as Kate,\nso that she should not be called Catherine.) Phinuit here looked a little\ndisconcerted, and mumbled, \"Well, that's what he said.\"\n[After another interval with Mrs. Holmes, Phinuit turned to me and said :]\nYou've got something here you want me to tell you about. I'll tell you\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 137\nall about it. Hodgson gave me something with influence of yours, and I did\nnot tell him right\u2014where is it ? Give it to me again. [I gave him the book\nmark, and wondered how he knew that he had given wrong information about\nit.] Yes, that's it. It's something to do with your sister Editha. (No, I do\nnot think she ever even saw it.) Well, you let me have it for a time,\nand I'D tell you all about it. I'll put it in my hair.\nThis mark has something to do with school-friend. (No.) No, not\nexactly that, but I see something about school about it. It's something\nto do with somebody that was under you\u2014someone that you had to teach.\nThere's an influence comes with it\u2014a little girl\u2014rather pretty. Light hair\nand dark eyes\u2014bright. You had something to do with teaching her. Nice\nlittle girl. She seems to recognise this. She's passed out of the body. You\nheard from her when she was ill. [All true.] There's another influence comes\nwith it\u2014not her brother, but she was very fond of him. She called him cousin\n\u2014Gideon\u2014he's in Australia. [It is not known where he is now.] He is\nerratic, but he is doing well, physically [laying great stress on the last word].\nHe has not passed out. He will return. Ella\u2014Elma\u2014Emly\u2014Elmly\u2014Oh,\nwhat is it ? Emily\u2014no, Emma\u2014Maria sends her love to Emma\u2014do you\nunderstand ? Maria sends her love to Emma, and says she is often with her.\nEmma is not well \u2014not at all well\u2014not happy. [Maria was the little girl's\nname ; Emma is the mother's name, and Gideon the name of her nephew,\nwhose whereabouts is not at present known.]\n[Note by R. H.]\nAt a sitting on June 25th, I gave Phinuit the bookmark, which Miss\nEdmunds had carefully wrapped up between two pieces of plain card. I\nknew nothing of the history of the bookmark. My notes are as follow :\u2014\n\"[Phinuit asks me to read it.] A little faint influence about the young\nlady with you. Didn't she wrap them up ? (Yes, I think so.) Fleshy lady\nconnected with this in body. It was given to her mother as a bookmark.\nThis has been in some book like a Bible thing, and it looks like I get the\ninfluence Margaret. There's also Edith. There's an influence here of a\nlady that's fond of her brother\u2014 Miss Edmunds' brother. . . . This\nhasn't so much of her influence as Edith's. I think Edith made it. (Is\nEdith in the body ?) Oui. Isn't Miss Edmunds funny ? She's handled this,\nhasn't she ? She put it there [indicating between cards], and I get all her\ninfluences come back with it. This came across water originally. These\n[cards] were handled more by her than this [mark], and the mark has been\nhandled more by the person who made it than by anybody else.\"\nOn my return from the sitting, Miss Edmunds informed me that the\nstatements about the bookmark itself were incorrect. I did not see Mrs.\nPiper again until after the sitting of July 1st.\nJuly 6th, 1891. (See also No. 61, p. 155.)\n[At the sitting on July 6th, besides giving information concerning some\ntests which I had brought with me, Phinuit gave messages \"from father,\"\nand stated that :] Your mother has been having pains in her head. She's\ngone from the place where I saw her first. [I was then myself under the\nimpression that mother was visiting my sister, but (October 2nd) I have just\n\fMr. R.

There are two Charlottes, sister and aunt. [True,\nand Phinuit makes a prophecy concerning my sister Charlotte.] [Messages\nto my brother Albert.] You are going to visit Albert soon.

And you'll also go\nto a country place where there are children and mountains\u2014a mountainous\nplace\u2014and you'll see your brother last of all. [October 2nd.\u2014I had then\njust received an invitation from Mrs. Hohues to spend a week with her at\nthe seaside, but I had not mentioned the fact either to Phinuit or Mrs.\nPiper, and Mrs. Holmes said that she had not mentioned it. I also have\nvisited \"the mountainous place where there were children,\" and am hoping\nsoon to visit my brother (as she did.\u2014R.H.), but all these circumstances,\nwere previously known to me and I expected each event to happen\nin the order which Phinuit described.] [Mention was also made in this\nsitting of a younger brother, and his name given without effort\u2014Martin.]\nL. Edmunds.\n44. Mrs. C. June 1901, 1891.\n[Mrs. C. had a sitting alone with Mrs. Piper in 1889. Of this no record\nwas made. Little mention of her husband was made in that sitting, which\nwas chiefly occupied by the subject of her daughter's ill-health. Mrs. C.\nlives in New York, and I believe that her name was unknown to Mrs. Piper.\nI was sent out of the room early in the sitting, and could hear only frag\nments of the conversation after this. At the close of the sitting Mrs. C.\ngave an account which I took down at the time. I abridge this account, and\nembody the information since received from Mrs. C. The names mentioned\nduring the sitting have been changed to others in the record at the request\nof Mrs. C. I made the appointments for both sittings.\u2014R.H.]\n[Re fountain pen.] This brings John in the spirit. John the son in body.\n[Correct.] Phinuit described a little elderly lady, nervous, in my surround\nings, and said she wouldn't live long. This suggests my sister, who is never\nin very good health. [An aunt living in New York, aged 76, not nervous,\ndeath not anticipated for several years, began to fail about June 20th, and\ndied July 10th.]\nHe said I would get a letter from my brother very shortly. [Not true.]\nHe said there was a stick with a funny handle, marks on it, a walking-\nstick, that belonged to an old gentleman, grandfather, my father, who had it\nwhen in the body, and that he wanted me to have it, that Sit has it and that\nI must ask for it. [The sister writes that there is a walking-stick used by\nher father. It has not a ci*iok handle, but a knob.]\nThe names Anderson or Andrews and Flack were given [not recognised].\nHe kept feeling about me and said : \"You have something about you belonging\nto him \" [my husband]. Felt my ring and said : \"Oh, he gave you that many\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 13{>\nyears ago.\" After searching about and touching various objects, he said :\n\" You've got my watch.\" I took it out. He said : \" Your husband says it's\nhis watch, but it's not his chain.\" This was correct. I had broken my own\nwatch about a month before, and since then have carried his watch, but had\ntaken off his chain and put my own chain on. Until the watch was men\ntioned I had entirely forgotten that I had it.\nPhinuit said that I had a bad time with my teeth a while ago, and that\nmy husband was with me [i.e., in spirit] when I had them extracted. I had\ntwo teeth extracted under gas a month or six weeks ago.\nReferences were made to a document, which made it clear that a cer\ntain insurance paper was intended. This I was requested to publish, on\nthe ground that it would bo of benefit to myself and a satisfaction to my\nhusband who would then feel that justice was done. The circumstances\nconnected with this document, which are too private to be mentioned in this\nreport, concerned a matter which was of the most vital interest to my\nhusband. It is the very matter he would be most likely to speak of if he\nwere actually in communication with me. Some specific advice was given\nabout the publication of this document. [This advice proved upon inquiry\nto be irrelevant.]\nA correct statement was made about the unfortunate sale of some of my\nproperty. Henry was correctly given as the first name of the man who\ndefrauded me.\nA prophecy made that Mrs. C. would be out of her difficulties \"when\nsnow came \" was not fulfilled.\n[NotebyR.H.]\n[At a sitting on July 8th, Phinuit said : ] \"John's lady feeling particularly\nblue to-day. I think this is the day John passed out of the body. I hear\nthis from John himself.\"\nMrs. C. writes on July 10th :\u2014\n\" Your note of the 8th is just received. I am sorry to say that Phinuit\nis 'mixed' in his facts, as the date of my husband's death was June 18th, the\nday before our sitting with Mrs. Piper. During the 8th, at the time you had\nthis sitting, I was not particularly 'blue,' and there was nothing unusually\ndepressing in any way, but I had a bad headache, and was feeling generally\ntired and miserable ; but the condition was more physical than mental.\nSittings 46-50.\nWhen I was in New York early in May, 1891, Mrs. Julia Sadler\nHolmes, a member of our Society, gave me, at my request, two locks\nof her hair for experiments with Mrs. Piper ; but I had not explained to\nher that Phinuit prefers locks cut close to the head, and I found\nlater that these two pieces had been cut several inches away.\nOn May 21st, 1891, at the end of a sitting where Phinuit had been\ndescribing the influences of other articles (sent to me by Mr. V.), I gave\nhim one of the two locks which I had first received from Mrs. Holmes.\nPhinuit said : \" I've seen this influence before. This came from across.\n\f140 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nthe water. Relative of this person across the water. Her name spells\nwith an ' E.' (No.) The influences are all mixed.\" And he declined\n.to do anything further with it.\nBeing aware that Miss R. was to have a sitting on May 23rd, I\nplaced the second of the two locks in a clean envelope, different from\nthose which I am in the habit of using, and requested Miss R. to give\nit to Phinuit during the course of the sitting. She did so, and Phinuit\nat once said that my influence was on the envelope, that the hair was\nthe \"same influence\" as that which I had recently given him, that he\ngot the name Esther with it, but that it had very little \" influence \"\nalxnit it, and he wanted a \" better \" piece. During a sitting which I\nhad on May 25th, Phinuit referred to this incident, and repeated that he\nwanted a \" better \" piece of hair, but did not mention the name Esther.\nI wrote to Mrs. Holmes on the subject and requested her to send me\nanother lock of hair cut close to the head, and some article of dress,\nsuch as a collar, which had come much in contact with the skin (Phinuit\nclaiming that such objects had \"influence\"), and she sent me a \"veritable\nscalp-lock,\" and a piece of ribbon which she had worn round her neck.\nI gave these to Phinuit on June 5th. In this and in the two follow\ning sittings with the articles received from Mrs. Holmes, the notes were\ntaken by me during the sitting, and copies of them forwarded to Mrs.\nHolmes. The remarks in square brackets (except where otherwise\nspecified) were either interpolated by Mrs. Holmes herself or incor\nporated by me from her letters in answer to my inquiries.\n45.

The cranky man is associated with a\ngeologist named Davis, who located some lead and silver mines near B. and\nthen ran off with the secret. We have been quite excited with this Davis,\nwho has now returned to B. Mrs. Piper caught all this from Harry's\nletter, which had probably been carried in the cranky man's pocket. The\nonly mistake she made was in the colour of my hair\u2014it was never black, but\nshaded from a brown to a gold. Curiously, what she handled she could\nnot see, and the cut foot in Montana was shown to her as mine. Possibly\nbecause this son Harry (not Harris) is nearer to me than any other living;\nthing.\n*****\nClosely connected with this Southern business is one James Boberts, a,\nfriend of the K family. Fortunes hang upon his honesty and ability. I\nthink the Miss Roberts and the Miss Davis are undoubtedly these two\ngentlemen. The Coopers are all related, and associated socially and\nfinancially with James Roberts, the K 's, and the \"cranky\" man.]\n46. Sitting on June 10th, 1891.\nRe Hair and Ribbon.\nThere's somebody connected with this named Vaughn. [Yes.] And\nMamie. [About that Vatu\/hn. He committed suicide. ... If the\nname were Manie, it would fit the situation just now, as the Manie K.\n(sister-in-law to my daughter) ... is constantly on our lips.]\nRe Strip of Velvet. [Since the previous sitting I had received from Mrs.\nHolmes a strip of velvet which she had worn.]\nSame influence. She lives out a little way. [Mrs. Holmes lives in a\nsuburb of New York.] There's a big vine [No, a tree in blossom] round the\nend of the house where she is, on the right as you go in. She's a very nice\nlady. Who's Emily ? [My sister who died in babyhood.] (I don't know.)\nWell, she knows who sho is. . . . She's got a mother, a father, and a\n\f142 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nbrother in spirit. [Yes. Not mother, but mother-in-law.] Either tho\nfather or the brother is named William. [It's the brother. His name was\nWilliam Henry Harrison Sadler. I generally called him Henrg.] There's\n.somebody named French connected with her. [Yes.] She takes me to New\nYork. [Yes.] (How do you know it's New York ?) I can see N. Y. I see\na desk, and a piece of statuary stands at the end of the desk, and I see a\nletter on it with N. Y. at the top. [The desk had ornaments, but no statue.\nThere are two bronze statues, however, on a bookcase near.] The letter\nbegins : \" My dear Lucy.\" She has a friend named Jones. [Yes. Who\nhasn't?] . . .' Emerson. [Not recognised.] You ask her if she didn't\nhave an aunt named Caroline or Katherine in spirit. [Yes, we called her\nAuntie Mason.] [See Notes to next Sittings, No. 47.\u2014R.H.] And there's\nDoctor Somebody here. (Who ? Can you get his name ?) [Doctor un\nknown.] It's in the surroundings of a doctor. I think this lady had a sister\nwho went across the water some time ago. I don't think you know this.\n[No, I went myself.] ... I see a letter on the desk :\u2014\nJune 2, 1891.\nMy Dear Lucy,\u2014\nWill go to-morrow evening\nif possible. In case you do not hear\ncome round.\n[I did not write this in the letter, but said these very words to her next day,\nor nearly.] (Can you see how it's signed ? ) I'm trying to. The last letter\nis \"s.\" (That's right.) [I was thinking of the last letter of the name\nHolmes.\u2014R.H.] [Here Phinuit tried to write the initials. His attempts\nshow two separate capital S's, another doubtful capital S, a scrawl like a\ncapital U, two initials together like LS, then three initials together, the first\nof which might be L or J or Q, the second of which might be S or G, and\nthe third of which is most like S.\u2014R.H.] Signed by initials. Looks like\nA. R. S. You know she's got three names. (That's right.) Looks like \"L\"\nor \"J.\" (Is that the first or last or the middle one 1 ) The first. I'll get\nmore another time. [When Mrs. Holmes signs \" initials,\" her J is as much\nlike an L as it is like a J.\u2014R.H.] [Lucy H. wrote me, June 1st, to meet\nher and go to H. the next Sunday. June 1st, I wrote her to visit me ; our\nletters crossed. Friday, June 5th, I called upon her, saying, \" Will you go\nto Gilmore's concert with me to-morrow evening ? In case you do not hear\nto the contrary, expect me about 5 p.m. Saturday. I will come round for you,\ntake you to the concert, and then home with me for Sunday. I did not\naddress her as \" My dear Lucy,\" but did sign my initials to a postal card,\nsent another mail, J. S. H.]\n47. Sitting on June 15th, 1891.\n[Mrs. Holmss understood that I was to try to get information from\nPhinuit, during the sitting, of her doings 11.30\u201412.30.]\nlie Glove, Mrs. Holmes.\nWho's Ella ? [See below.] I've seen this influence before. Somebody's\nsweetheart. You handed ma some influence like this before. Give me the\npiece that goes with it. I saw the 'date with this, you know. N.Y.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 143\n(That's right.) This lady's been across the water. [Yes, once only, to England.]\nBeen across two or three times. Spent much time in Paris. [Ella has. I\nhave never been on the Continent.]\nBe Velvet as well, also Hair and Bibbon.\nThis [velvet] is a bonnet tie. Nice generous bit of hair, this is. Cut\nright close to the head. Dersyer, I see that written. [Unrecognised by me.]\nShe has a large blue vase that was given to her by an elderly gentleman and\nlady across the water. [No, but we have two Bolton vases brought from\nIreland, by Miss Maggie K.] Ask her if she knows anybody named Sweat.\n[Yes, Frances Sweat, sister of my aunt Louisa, died many years ago.]\n. . . You know you have to go up steps to get into her house. There's\na little thing in front that you swing in. (Hammock ? ) Yes, hammock.\n[Baby's swing on side piazza. Hammock is in garden.] There's a chair\n-with a crooked back. [No.] A funny back that throws back with a spring.\n[We have a velvet chair in New York that falls back with a rod\u2014too big\nfor this cottage.] There is a young lady with very dark hair sitting\ntherein this minute. (About 11.66 a.m., June 15th, 1891.) [Do not know.]\n12 Noon.\u2014The elderly lady has a parcel, a square package, looks like a\nbook, in her hand. She's been reading, and she's just arranged something\non her head. It looks like a little wrap she's thrown over her head. The lady\nherself has gone to speak to the younger lady, and she has on a dark dress\nwith little light spots in it. [Wrong, but see Mrs. H.'s letter concerning the\ndress.\u2014R.H.] . . . She has a friend that she's very fond of, named\nElla or Ellen. [Eleanor B., commonly called Ella.] How do you spell that 1\nThat's her name\u2014S\u2014T\u2014R, S\u2014T\u2014A\u2014. [Gives it up, apparently.\u2014R.H.]\nShe knows who Louise is, Louise in spirit. [I have Aunt Louise in the body.]\n(What is she doing ?) [I explained about appointment from 11.30 to 12.30.\n\u2014R.H.] She came mighty near forgetting it. [No, I thought very much\nabout it.]\n12.15.\u2014She looks as if she's putting some flowers in a vase. [Yes, I was.]\nShe trims and puts them in that. [Yes, pulled out dead ferns and placed\n-vase on desk.] Since I saw her influence the other day [Wednesday,\nJune 10th.\u2014R.H.] she has been having the pillows changed in the room\nwhere she sleeps, and some things changed in the bed [Yes, bed broke\ndown\u2014new post put in], and she's been having something put up over the\nwindow. [Yes.] Do you know her girl 1 (Her daughter 1) Yes. (Yes, I\nknow her.) She's a nice girl. . . . Her daughter has a friend who's\ngoing to be married right away. [Yes, we guess so.] (A lady?) Oui. The\nlast part of her name ends in son, doesn't it? (No.) Last part of her first\nname ? (No.) She has three names. Eliza comes with this (velvet) and\nshe's in the body. [Yes, \"Aunt Eliza,\" sister of Albert's mother.] [See\nbelow.\u2014R.H.]\n12.22.\u2014Now she's doing something to a picture\u2014the mother, who is\nstill in the body\u2014I think there's something the matter with her teeth.\n[My notes are not clear as to whether this statement was about Mrs. Holmes\nor her mother, but my impression during the sitting was, I believe, that it\nreferred to the mother of Mrs. Holmes, viz., Mrs. Sadler, who writes on\nDec. 4th, 1891 : \" I cannot remember toothache on June 15th, 1891. Have\n\f144 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nhad general trouble with my teeth all the year.\"\u2014R.H.] [Yes, lost gold out\nof my back tooth yesterday.] [Phinuit asked at beginning of sitting if he\nwasn't right about the mother, father, and brother being in spirit. I said\nthat the mother-in-law was in spirit.\u2014B.H.] I hear the name of William\nHenry, who's called Henry. [At beginning of sitting Phinuit asked me if\nWilliam wasn't the name of the brother. I said that the lady recognised\nthat, although she didn't at first.\u2014R.H.] Did you ever see her paint?\n(No.) [My daughter is an artist.] She's doing something with a brush.\nNow she's dropped that\u2014she sits down at desk to write. Charles is on the\npage in front of her. [7 sat at desk to write, not my daughter.] [The above\nremarks, including the painting, were applied by Phinuit to Mrs. Holmes.\u2014\nR.H.]\n12.25.\u2014Now I see her go to the window and speak to a man, short, kind\nof stout. [Yes, the butcher.] She reaches up and pulls something down.\n[I opened blind for more light and arranged curtain.] She's gone back to\nsit down again, at the desk. [Yes.] I hear \"Caroline, aunt, passed away\nwith stomach and heart trouble, recognises this influence.\" [Yes. A dear\nfriend, Aunt Caroline Mason\u2014Katherine was her sister-in-law, also called by\nme Aunt Kate.] She seems to be writing. [Yes, I was writing with plan\nchette.] Albert\u2014cousin, a wandering sort of fellow, something to do with\nsoldiers, fighting. Old-fashioned picture of him taken some years ago.\n[Yes, on a hobby-horse.] He doesn't know whether she or his mother, her\naunt, has the photo. [Aunt Eliza has it.] He was very fond of shooting.\n[Yes, but Albert is alive.] Maria. A relative on her husband's side.\n[Maria Holmes, but on my mother's side, wife of her brother. I am\nnamed Julia Maria from this aunt.]\n12.30.\u2014She's got a whole box of things. She's pawing them over for all\nshe's worth. [I was.] You ask her for another piece of fresh hair, cut\nclose, but I don't want to rob her head.\n[Further comments.]\nI have a small steamer trunk in my bedroom, full of MSS., &c. About 12\nnoon I ran up to this trunk after a red pencil. At 11.30, June 15th, I sat down\nto my writing-desk in bay window to write with planchette. Noticing some\nflowers fading in glass dish on the desk, I stopped to pull out dead ferns and\nrearrange the daisies. On the paper under planchette was the name Charles,\nwhich Lucy Hothersall had partially written last week, Sunday. (No, I never\nspoke to her of Mrs. Piper or our experiments.) It was very hot, and plan\nchette was evidently wilted. He, she, or it. did manage, however, to spell\nout Phinuit once or twice, with a very squeaky pencil, which rasped me\nso, I threw it away, and got the new red one from \" box of things \" upstairs.\nStrange Phinuit, in second sitting, should have given \" Caroline and\nKatherine \" together. They were sisters-in-law. I always called them Aunt,\nthough neither were related by blood. Caroline Mason's daughter, Emma,\nmarried my mother's nephew, Edgar Holmes. We were intimate from-\nchildhood, and I never knew any difference between my own aunt, Maria\nHolmes, Edgar's mother, and \"Auntie Mason,\" Emma's mother. Albert\nHolmes is Edgar's cousin and mine. Albert's Aunt Eliza, his mother's sister,\nadopted him on the death of his mother, Susan, and we cousins always called\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 145\nher Aunt Eliza. She is now living, and Albert has always lived with her,\nexcept when he wanders away ; he is rather of n roving disposition.\nCatherine Mason Curtis, Emma's aunt, is principal of Livingston Park\nSeminary. Emma and I were educated there and called her Aunt Kate. These\nmay be prosy details to you, but they are important as proofs of Phinuit's\npower.\n*****\nI have a dark blue dress with small white spots, but I did not wear it at\nall on June 15th. The hammock is only a few yards from the parlour bay\nwindow, swinging from a pear and cedar tree, around which twines a grape\nvine, forming a natural arbour. It is out of sight of the piazza with the\nwooden swing, on the opposite side of the house, in the garden. There are\nthree steps leading up to the side piazza where swing is, and it is the first\nthing one would naturally nofcice coming from the depjt. There are also\nthree steps loading to front piazza, where you sat sneezing that cold night,\nbut no hammock or swing in view from that.\nDuring the two weoks footboard was in city being mended we put pillows,\nout on grass and looked them over. We did this twice.\nThe something over windows was curtains. We put up a new set in the\nsitting-room downstairs. This room has an antique oak folding bed, too\nlarge to he got upstairs, and I slept here all winter, but my bedroom is really\nthe one above, where mahogmy bed is. I had it at first and moved back\nthere this spring. This is why Phinuit speaks of them both as \"my room.\"\nThe curtains were too long. My daughter arranged the extra length in it\nItimhreq,nn drapery over the top, which I afterward rearranged to suit my\nself. . . . We did this about June 1st.\nI cannot remember the exact second when I fixed blind and flowers, or\ns|ioke to butcher\u2014will take the watch next time. They all occurred within\nthe hour, at intervals of fifteen or twenty minutes. I went to box of things,\nabout noon, in the middle of experiment.\nI think Auntie Mason died with stomach and heart trouble. Was sick\na long time, up and down.\nJulia Holmes.\nMrs. H. writes on June 21st, 1891 :\u2014\nAt 12.30, June 15th, I went upstairs, changed morning dress for street\ncostume, opened trunk, searched among your letters for address of\nDr. Lukens, and took the 1 p.m. train for New York. I was at the trunk\nabout 12.40. J. S. H.\nAt this stage I acquainted Professor Bowditch with the circum\nstances of the previous experiments, and arranged with him that Mrs,\nHolmes should write down, at the time, accounts of her doings between\n11.15 and 12.30 on the mornings of June 23rd and 24th, sign them\na.id obtain her daughter's signature, and post them immediately to\nProfessor Bowditch. Similarly, I was to send at once to Professoi-\nBowditch my notes taken during the sitting. This programme was\ncarried out, but it will be seen from the reports that there is practically\nno correspondence between Phinuit's descriptions and the notes made\nL\n\f14G Mr. R- Hodgson.\nby Mrs. Holmes during the time of the experiment. A few days later\nI sent the notes of the sittings to Mrs. Holmes, requesting her to\ncomment upon the statements made by Phinuit, and to specify whether\nPhinuit's descriptions given during the hour of experiment appeared to\nbe correct pictures of incidents which had happened at other times.\n48. Sitting ou June 23rd, 189l.\n[R.H. taking notes.] (Entranced 11.25 a.m.)\n1. 11.30.\u2014[It. H. gives Phinuit a fresh lock of hair in piece of muslin\nfabric, which Phinuit than sep:tr.,tcs.] That's the same lady. That's our\nfriend in New York. (Right. I want you to toll me what's she's doing.)\n2. 11.35.\u2014Just at this very minute she's reading. She's got a book,\nlooking in it. I get the name Elizabeth. (How do you get it ! ) I can hear\nit. And there's somebody connected with her, named Alice.\n3. 11.37.\u2014She's laid the book in a chair. She goes to a mirror and she's\ndoing something to her front hair. You know how she wears it, with funny\nthings here\u2014frizzelettes. She's tidying them up a little.\n31. 11.40.\u2014 Now I see her walking to and fro, to and fro, to and fro,\n&c.\n11.41.- Whose little child is that? (Can't yim tell me?) I think it's\nher grandchild. Looks like a boy. She's stopped and spoke to him,\nstopped the pacing to and fro, you know.\n4. 11.42.\u2014Now it looks as if she was showing him some pictures. (In a\nbook ?) Looks like pictures of persons, you know. (Portraits !) Things\nlike that.\n5. 11.44. \u2014Now she goes to the desk, now gone back to the chair ; takes\nup book, folds it and puts on a shelf high up. Now she goes to the desk, and\nhas seated herself.\n0. 11.45. - She says : \" Oh, how strange ! \" W\u2014I\u2014L\u2014L\u2014I\u2014A\u2014M\nand there's something about wafer, W\u2014A\u2014T\u2014E \u2014It. I don't know what\nthat is. (Do y-ou see those words written ? ) I do.\n7. She leaves that\u2014she's going upstairs. She goes to the room to her\nright. She turns in, she takes up a garment off the cot and brushes it. She's\ngot a little cold. Now I see her go to a closet- she stands a minute.\n11.47.\u2014Oh, she's hanging up this garment, smoothing it down, and she's\nclosed the door. (Of the closet ? ) Of the closet.\n8. She isn't feeling just well, she's got a slight headache. She's now\narranging something here [touching me down the buttons of waistcoat].\nFastening it. [Front of dress, apparently.]\n9. 11.50.\u2014Now the lady that I saw before [at previous sitting] goes and\nspeaks to her and calls \" Mother.\" The lady [mother] leaves the apartment\nand is going down again. The one that's calling looks as if she was going out\nside with something in her hand and watering the (lowers. The elderly lady\ngoes to the door and is speaking to her while she's doing that.\n10. She's got on a dark garment with stripes, stripes. Now I see her\nI I Iking to a kind of a stout person\u2014looks like a servant. (A woman ? ) Qui.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 147\nShe's turned back from the doorway more into the passage-room. The\nwoman leans over the railing [from upstairs] and asks her about the gar\nment which she [the servant] has in her hand. The lady tells her she had\nbetter put it on the line.\n11. 11.57.\u2014The servant has disappeared. She goes to the back part of\nthe building. A lady in black comes in, dressed in\u2014like mourning ; a caller.\nShe [subject of experiment] takes from a little stand in the room a photograph\nsind shows it to the lady [caller]. The photograph is of another lady at a\ndistance. She wants to know if she doesn't think it's good. She's now in\ngeneral conversation with the lady. I'll have to wait till she changes that.\nThe lady who has called has a little black thing in her hand, looks like an\numbrella.\n12.3.\u2014[Here Phinuit explains that the spirit William is telling him some\nthings, that other things he sees himself.]\n12.5.\u2014I'm sorry she's got this tickling sensation in her throat. She does\nthis, h\u2014m, h\u2014m [clearing the throat], while she's talking.\n12. 12.0. \u2014Lady just going out now. She's rather stout, nice-looking\nlady [i.e., the caller]. She [Mrs. Holmes] mentioned to the lady that sho\nwas trying some experiments with a friend of hers, but she doesn't tell her\nhow or which way. She walks out with her a little way.\n13. 12.7.\u2014The lady's [Mrs. Holmes] got a little rheumatism in one of\nher legs. Caller lady comes around in a carriage. The carriage wait* for her.\nAny questions you want to ask me ? I'm getting a little obscure, can't see so\nwell.-\n14. 12.8. \u2014Now she's picked up something and eating it. (What is it I )\nIt looks like a little round thing, kind of white. Perhaps it's a cake.\n15. 12.10.\u2014Now there seems Ui be something going on here. There's a\nliny called, and she delivers to him a parcel. Now she's gone to lie down, and\nshe'll probably stay there some time, so I'm going to leave her. (See anything\nwritten on desk ? ) T-e-1-1 m-e t-h-i-s i-f y-o-u c-a-n.\n16. 12.13.\u2014(Can you see the daughter?) She's thinking about going\nsiway. Isn't that all right ? (I don't know. Do you mean\"going away from\nwhere's she's living ? ) Yes.\n17. You tell her\u2014elderly lady \u2014 the boy's not going to be ill, and to taks\ngood care of herself.\n18. 12.15.\u2014She's got a book. I didn't see her pick it up. Oh, it's the\nsune book. She's lying there, reclining.\n19. 12.20. \u2014She's just had a picture changed on the wall. She had\nsomebody else move it. He's gone now. He says \"Good-bye\" [i.e., the\n\" spirit \" William, who, according to Phinuit, has been supplying most of tin\ninformation].\n12.25.

This lady lost a little\n.child many years ago, a little child that scarcely lived, stillborn or nearly so.\n2. Her own mother is quite well, but she's a little bit deaf. A little\ntrouble on right side of head of mother. The right ear is a little troublesome\nsometimes. Years ago she had i|uite a severe illness in the stomach, but\nrecovered, and she'll stay in the body some time yet. William remembers it.\n\u00a3The foregoing concerns Mrs. H.'s mother.] This lady [Mrs. H.] takes a good\ndeal from her mother. Aunt Caroline on the mother's side. You want me\nto go and see what she is doing I (Yes.) Sometimes William tells me and\nsometimes I go myself. He takes me there.\n3. 11.34.\u2014Her throat's a little better to-day.\n4. 11.35.\u2014 She has a big stick in her hand, looks like a handle. She's gob\nit, and she's reaching up ipjite highly and arranging a picture on the wall. A\ncord from which the picture is suspended. Now she steps to the window\nAnd takes the stick and reaches up and drawing the draperies\u2014sort of\nportiere that hangs by the window on one side. She stands the stick in the\ncorner, and makes the canopy thing drop down from outside. William tells\niue it is a-w-n-i-n-g.\n5. She's got on a greyish gown.\n6. 11.40.\u2014-Now she's helping this fleshy person I told you about\u2014looks\nlike a servant\u2014 to arrange furniture and things in the room.\n7. 11.42.\u2014 Now she's disposed of this person and she's sitting down.\n8. 11.44.\u2014Well I'll be hanged if she isn't musical. Her fingers going\nlike this [tapping with fingers as if strumming on a board]. (Do you hear\n.anything ?) No, 1 think she's doing it for fun, to see if I can see it. Now\nshe goes to the desk. She's writing something. Does she write to you what\n.she's doing ? (Yes.) She's writing down : Drawn curtain. Talked to Willie.\nWho's Willie ? (I don't know.)\n9. Told Mnry In brush my cloak. Please hang in closet in mil room after\nputting on line.\n10. M,) dear mother, I trill send tilings to i\/OH to-morrow if possible.\n11.50.\u2014That's all. Now she's stopped.\n11. 11.51.\u2014Samps. Can't get any more of that now. Perhaps I'll get\n.that later. I see June.\n12. She's got a letter that's got your influence there, on her desk. She's\njust lifted it up and looked at it. Have you been writing to her ? (Yes.)\nShe's laid it on one side now.\n13. 11.54.\u2014 Do you know she's got something ? She's just picked it up ;\nlooks like a watch\u2014a round thing, shiny. Hold on now, she's writing\nsomething. June 24th. Then a dash\u2014two ones and two and five, 1125.\n(She's in the same surroundings ?) She's at her desk. That what yon\nmean ? (Yes.)\n14. Had a call from Mrs. French. I don't think that's ,juite right, but\njt looks like it.\n\f150 Mr. R. Hodgson.\n15. Sampson. (Is Sampson written thoro ? ) Yes, that looks like on the\nnote to mother.\n16. Do you know Steven? (No, I don't think so. Do you see that\nwritten 1 ) No, I hear it.\n17. 12.2.\u2014I see Mary written. Shu had a grandfather named John.\n(Do you sec that written ! ) No, I hear that.\n18. 12.3.\u2014As tine as you live she's had the portrait of a gentleman\nmoved on the wall. I see portrait. (Written ?) Yes.\n19. 12.5.\u2014 She gets up, and takes a little red wrap-like thing, and put*\nover her shoulders. Then she goes back, and sits down again in the same\nscat. \" Oh dear ! \" she says. She takes the book on her knee now. She\nwrites pretty fast this minute.\n20. Here comes the same girl now. (The servant ? ) Yes. Raps on the\ndoor and jvtsses her a paper. She [Mrs. H.] says, \"Lay it down, please-\nthank you.\" Servant passes out.\n21. Now the daughter comes in and sits down in rocking-chair and talks,\nwith her mother about making arrangements about a house.\n22. Who do those two children belong to ? Her daughter ? She don':\nknow but she'll send one of them away for a little time. For rest and\nchange, you know. Have you been there yourself ? (Yes.)\n23. 12.8.- Did you notice that little body of water near there ? (Yes. )i\n24. I should think she wouldn't like to be watched like this, but she\ndon't mind.\n25. 12.10.\u2014Do you know, I see the name Margaret.\n20. This lady [Mrs. H.] likes Miss P .\n27. The daughter says something\u2014she'll have somebody sounds like\nEd\u2014something\u2014trim up that tree.\n28. 12.12.- - Her daughter shows her something white like cloth, and asks,\nher how to put it together, which is the best way to have it go.\n29. Right behind the lady [Mrs. H.] is a stand with something yellow in\nit like fruit.\n30. 12.15. \u2014Upon my word, that lady's going out to drive. She thinks,\nshe won't go till a little later, so it's all right. What time of day ! She's,\ntalking about lunch. She doesn't know whether to drive before lunch or\nafter. She finally thinks she'll not go till after.\n31. I mud get these off by early mail to-morrow. (She writes that ! }\nOld'. No, I've made a mistake there. She says that.\n32. 12.18.\u2014She's taken up a little thing and looks as if she was doing,\nsomething to the ends of her nails. Now she sits back and rocks.\n33. The daughter's just going out. The mother goes towards the window\nand looks out. Then she puts her hands behind her and paces the room to.\nand fro, to and fro, like she did before, you know. She goes towards door,\nwhich is open, then goes out into the yard.\n34. 12.20.\u2014Now she's stooped over looking at something, a Hower.\nShe's got a little Iiair of nippers and she's culling them. She's trimming the\nends of them. She's nipping off the little briars on the lower end of the\nstems, and the lower leaves, to make a pretty nosegay.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 151\n35. 12.23.\u2014Now she pulls up her gown and she steps up the steps aml\nshe comes in. Now she goes to a long mantel\u2014like, takes a vase, puts\nwater in it, puts the flowers in it, and stands it on her desk. Looks like roses.\n36. 12.25.\u2014Now she's just picked up her pencil. Picked. She puts\nhar hand up to har ear. Flowers, trimmed stems, put them on desk in my\nroom. I'm getting dim.\n37. Now looks as if she was brushing herself [imitating]. (With her\nhands ?) I don't see any brush.\n38. 12.26.\u2014Left room, goas out and upstairs. Goes to mirror and is\ntidying herself up. I cannot see any more. 11.29.\u2014I'm too dim. I can't\nsee any more. I haven't heard William so plainly. I've had to work alone\na little bit. He helps me, he gives me strength. If I hadn't had him to\nhelp me, I couldn't do half so well. The influence of the articles [lock of\nhair, ribbon, &c] goes through me to him like a battery.\n39. You ask her when you write if she remembers Florence. William\nsays this.\n[Notes made by Mrs. Holmes during the hour of sitting. In envelopa\naddressed to Professor H. P. Bowditch, and postmarked \" New York, June\n24, 2 p.m.,\" and \" Back Bay, Boston, June 25, 7 a.m.\"]\nWednesday, June 24<\/t, 1891.\nCottage parlour at 11.15 a.m. I sit in bay window, making the word\nPhinuit in leaves. For fifteen minutes I sew green leaves on a sheet of white\npaper. From 11.30 to 11.45 I write a few lines to Phinuit on this sheet.\nAt 11.45 I stop writing and go to the garden to pick flowers and hunt for a\nchild's sun hat. Do not find the hat, but pick up a small blue jacket. At 12\nI lie in the hammock and \"loaf with (Walt Whitman) and my soul \" for\nfifteen minutes. Then a boy drives up with a cart and a dog. I get up, pat\nthe dog, take down hammock and speak to the boy. At 12. 15 I return to\n1iarlour, write a few lines to Phinuit, and lie down on sofa. I lie on the same\nsofa, in the same dress which my daughter, Mrs. K -, wore yesterday,\nimitating her manner and attitude. At 12.30 I rise, sit at desk and write to\nProfessor Bowditch. It is now 12.45.\nJfLiA Holmes.\n[Later notes by Mrs. Holmes on the report of sitting on June 24th, 1891.]\n1. Yes, I lost a little child, years ago\u2014a premature birth\u2014never knew\nthe sex.\n2. Yes, my own mother is a little deaf (don't remember in which ear),\nsometimes worse than others. Yes, her illness generally takes that form. Has\na chronic inflammation of stomach and bowels. Do not remember any special\nsevere sickness so long ago (forty years). William might. No. I am not\nat all like my mother.\n3. Shouldn't have noticed throat if Phinuit hadn't called my attention\nto it. Yes, I have some irritation there\u2014the tonsils are always a little\nswollen.\n4. No, didn't have stick in my hand, and we have no awnings anywhere.\n[See Addendum, p. 153.] I daily dust a painting which hangs over writing-\ndesk. I use a small feather duster. Picture hangs close to curtain.\n\f152 Mr. M. Hodgson.\no. I had on white muslin.\n6. We have a new servant, who is fleshy, named Bridget. No, I was\nnot helping her arrange furniture at this time.\n7. No, not at this hour.\n8. I played piano while my daughter rooked rag doll, Mc day before,\nabout this time, 11.44. I played \"Johnny, get your gun,\" &c, to see if\nPhinuit could hear me. Yes, I was \" doing it for fun, to see if 1 can see it.\"\nI left piano and returned to desk. I wrote two lines in a letter to Dr.\nHodgson, and made words to look at. 1 did not write \"Drawn curtain,\"\nhut I explained in my letter to Dr. Hodgson, finished in the afternoon, about\nsome curtains put up throe weeks previously. [All this on the day before,\nJune 23rd.\u2014B.H.] Did not say or write \" talked to Willie.\"\n9. No.\n10. Six weeks ago I wrote my mother I would send her things by\nexpress\u2014may have said \" to-morrow if possible.\"\n11. See 15.\n12. Yes, I had Dr. Hodgson's last letter of instructions on my desk, to\nwhich I repeatedly referred.\n13. Yes, I had watch on my desk, consulted it every fifteen minutes, and\nwrote the hour and minutes on iiaper.\n14. No, had no call from Mrs. French\u2014no one called.\n15. Sampson was a nickname given to my baby, Charles Hoyt Holmes,\non account of his extreme littleness. He lived six months. Sampson was\nnot written anywhere, and 1 wrote no note to mother at this time.\n16. I know Mary Stevens, nee Holmes, my mother's niece. My mother\nalso has an uncle Stephen.\n17. I had a great-great-grandfather named John Sadler. Nu Mary\nwas written.\n18. Wrong. We have no portrait of gentleman on any wall.\n19. I got up and put on a red shawl over my muslin dress, wore it in\nthe garden, in the hammock, and after experiment closed. I wrote pretty\nfast fifteen minutes later, when finishing notes for Dr. Bowditch\u2014hurried\nto catch postman.\n20. Wrong.\n21. No, my daughter was in New York. We have often talked over a\nnew house, which we have been designing during the last month.\n22. My grandchildren Kenneth and Marjorie K . We have not\ndiscussed sending them away, but I have been anxious about Marjorie, and\nwished she might have a change.\n23. Yes. Spuyten Duyvil Creek and Hudson River.\n25. Margaret is my daughter.\n26. True.\n27. We have not said anything to Ned about training tree. He is the\ngardener. [See Addendum, p. 153.]\n28. No.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 153\n29. A yellow table stands just back of my writing chair. Had a dish of\ncherries there day before experiment.\n30. No.\n31. Wrong.\n32 and 33. At 11.14 my daughter went to the station. I hadn't small\nleaves enough to make the word Phinuit. I went to the garden for another\nbranch, came back, and cut off the smallest ones with some little scissors\nlying on desk. Cutting out round dots for the i, some leaves fell in my lap.\nI brushed them off with my hands. Think I cleaned nails with these scissors\njust before beginning to cut leaves. Don't remember sitting in rocking-chair,\nbut did pace up and down two or three times after coming from garden. It\nis my habit.\n34. Yes, the smaller leaves were all at the end of the branch\u2014 not to\nmake a nosegay, but a Phinuit.\n35. At 12.15 I lifted my dress, came up steps, went to Iwokcase, put\nflowers (daisies) in a yellow vase, but forgot the water. I put vase back on\nbookcase. There was a pitcher of roteu on desk\u2014wild roses, brought on\nSunday. The same wild roses are painted on the pitcher.\n36. At 12.25 I took my pen and wrote few lines to Phinuit. No, did\nnot say \" Put them on desk in my room,\" but gathered up stems left from\nword Phinuit and laid them on top of desk by the roses.\n37. May have brushed a few leaves from my dress just here, but think I\ndid it all before\u2014remember going to open window to let leaves fall in grass.\n38. Don't remember doing this at any time.\n.39. Can't remember Florence.\nAddendum : That pole my daughter put out of the window to poke Walter's\ncoat off the roof may be the pole Phinuit saw. Could he have mistaken the\ncoat for an awning 1 I was writing to you about it, and my letter lay upon\ndesk during hour of experiment.i Could he have sensed the word Walter and\nmistaken it for Water? He confused me and my daughter, and he mixed\nup the two days of experiments, but he really did see a good deal.\nWhile lying in hammock, morning before first experiment, June 23rd, I\nlooked into cedar and pear trees and thought if I were mistress here, I should\n\u2022' have A'erf trim up these trees.\" But nothing of this kind was taid. It\nwas about this time my daughter came to the window with the pole when 1\nlaughed and cried out to her : \"Oh, if Phinuit could only see you now.\"\nJvt.ia Holmes.\n[Note by R.H.]\nThe following statements were made by Phinuit to me at a sitting on June\n25th, 1891 :\u2014\n11.40.\u2014She is taking books out. She's been dusting them. [No.]\n12.31.\u2014She's written two notes and posted them off this very day.\n' June 23rd. \" Wonder if Phinuit saw [my daughter] wrap the window curtain\nabout her shoulders and poke Walter's old coat off the bay window roof with a\nlong pole about 10 30 tins a.m.\"\u2014[Extract from letter to me from Mrs. Holmes,\nwritten June 23rd ; received by me on return from sitting on Juno 24th.\u2014R. H.]\n\fMr. R, Hodr\/son.\n[Yes.] There's boon .1 dark-coloured man there within 24 hours. [No.] I\nsaw her just a little while ago, combing her hair, brushing her hair. [Yes.]\nShe's going to make a call, then she's going to do a few little things at home.\n[No.] She wrote a lot of numbers in one of the books\u2014objects that she's\ngoing to get- a sort of list. [My daughter did - made a list, went to the city,\nand called on Ella, June 24th, not 25th.]\n50. Miss Edmunds and Mrs. Holmes. July 1st, 1891.\n[I was at Bar Harbor June 26th to July 3rd, and having learned by letter\nfrom Mrs. Holmes that she intended to spend a day or two in Boston, and\nwished to have a sitting with Mrs. Piper, I explained the circumstances to\nMiss Edmunds (my assistant), and requested her to accompany Mrs. Holmes\nto the sitting and take notes. Mrs. Holmes came to my office upon her\narrival in Boston, on June 30th, and had an interview with Miss Edmunds,\nwho was to have a sitting on July 1st. Mrs. Holmes did not wait till July\n1st, and went to see Mrs. Piper in the afternoon of June 30th in the hope\nof obtaining a sitting. Mrs. Piper could not give her a sitting then, but\nMrs. Holmes had some conversation with Mrs. Piper and, inadvertently,\n\" revealed her identity \" as the subject of the experiments which I had been\nmaking. The new matter, therefore, mentioned to Mrs. Holmes at thin\nsitting can hardly be vegarded as of evidential value, and 1 give the details\nonly of the attempt Ui obtain from Phinuit some description of my own\ndoings during the hour of the experiment.\u2014R. H.]\n[L.E. taking notes.] (Mrs. Piper entranced al,out 11.30.)\n***\u2022\u2022* *\n[L. E. speaks of the li>w\u2014twelve o'clock\u2014and suggests that Phinuit be\n\"sent after\" Dr. Hodgson. Phinuit does not seem to comprehend at first,\nand goes on :] . . .\n[Phinuit is told again to see where Dr. Hodgson is.] Is that when-\nMarie D is ? I'll go there. I saw him a minute ago. (What is he\ndoing ! ) [Long pause of nearly two minutes, during which Mrs. Piper\nbreathes heavily and seems to be in a deep, natural sleep ; takes her Hand\naway from Mrs. Holmes, and her face is seen looking perfectly natural. |\nHa ! What do you think he is doing ? He handed a book to Marie D .\nShe turns it over. Hopped over some of the pages and handed it back to him.\nHe says he is going out with Charles\u2014going out towards the water\u2014going to\ntake .1 ride when 1 left him. He had one foot crossed over the other ; shows\nthe book to Marie and goes out. He looks like a countryman. (What's\nhe got on ?) Oh, he looks like a Scotchman. [Another 1wiuse, during which\nMrs. Piper again seems asleep.] Oh, he's flopped over on his stomach '.\nNow he's turned over the other way ! I never saw him cut up like\nthat before. He throws both arms up. Now he's stretching and\nyawning ! . . . [Long pause again.] Ha ! ha ! He did something\nlike leap-frog with Charles\u2014like leaping frog. (On the sands ? ) No, 0ii\nthe front of the building, at the farther end of it. He going to take a drive\nnow\u2014will presently. [Pause again.] He's got into a kind of funny thing\nand rolled off.\n* \u2666 * * *\n[Mrs. Piper came to herself at 12.40.]\n\fObservations of Certain 1'hcnomenu of Trance. 155-\n[Notes by K. H.]\nI made only the following notes during the time of the experiment : \u2014\n12.\u2014Up from beach with Miss A. Carriage.\n12.15.\u2014Started for Green.\n12.17. \u2014Dropped book.\n[I was staying at Mrs. D 's, in I5ar Harbor, as was known to Miss.\nEdmunds and also, I believe, to Mrs. Piper. Phinuit usually calls Mrs.\nD. by the name Marie (Mary), and Mr. D. by his first name Charles. I did\nnot look \"like a Scotchman,\" but Phinuit's remarks might have done very\nwell for George D., who wore knickerbockers and a tam o'shanter hat fre\nquently during my visit. I had also specially noticed him lounging on the\ngrass and flinging his arms and lxxly about, but could not say at what time\nhe did this, nor could he give me any information. Somewhere between\n11.30 and 12 I strolled down to the edge of the water with Miss A., return\ning about 12. I fell on a slippery rock just as we left the beach. The\ncarriage was waiting to take a iwirty of us up Green Mountain. We waited\na short time for some other members of the lwirty, and then we mounted\nthe high carriage, and, as Phinuit describes it, evidently near the right\nmoment, \"rolled off.\" The incident of the drive appears to be the only\none that Phinuit hit correctly- -as to time. As we started in the carriage\nwe were joking about the possibility of Phinuit's seeing us.]\n51. Alius Edmunds. July 6th, 1891.\n[From notes made during the sitting by Miss Edmunds.]\n[Mrs. Piper entranced about 11.45. I handed to Phinuit an envelope\ncontaining what I afterwards found to be a piece of narrow white silk ribbo\nPhinuit's remarks are abridged.]\n[Phinuit takes the ribbon from its wrappings.] It's nothing but a string\nlike thing, nothing but string. I get Hodgson's influence\u2014Hodgson and\nsome woman put that together. [He then threw the wiajs on the ground\nand tucked the \"string\" in Mrs. Piper's hair. I then gave him the large\nenvelope containing some MSS.] That's another of Hodgson's tricks. . . .\nYou see if there is not writing on that. (Yes, there is.) Open it out. [I open\nit out and put it over his head.] No, not that way ; put it with the writing\nnext to my head. [I turned it over.] There, that's better. I want to get\nHodgson's influence off it. He has had something to do with it, but he\ndidn't write it. Now, please, give me the wrapper it was in. You see, if\nwe put anything like this into a wrapper the wrapper holds the influence.\nIt's a kind of document. It does not belong to wrapper. I wanted to get\nit right side up, it was no good the other way. You wait a minute and I'll\nstrain it all out. It has been written a long time\u2014 has not been much\nhandled\u2014came way across country. (Across the water?) [Hesitatingly.]\nYes, across the water. (I don't know anything about it.) No, I know you\ndon't, it's some of Hodgson's tricks. If I could only get the least bit of\nperspiration of the person who handled it, but there's nothing. And\nthat thing\u2014the string thing\u2014is just a joke [taking it from his hair and\nthrowing it on the floor]. Somebody connected with this [the manuscript]\nthat's lost, someone that's lost, don't you understand ? . . . There is.\n\fir,G Mr. 11. Hodgson.\nno magnetism in that. [The MS.\u2014Creases it up and throws it after tho\nribbon.]\n(Can you find out anything about this ?) [Giving him some manuscript\nwritten by \" Y.,\" which he throws away immediately, saying : ] This makes\nme cross ! . . . This takes me to a relative. (No.) I saw this with\nHodgson. When he handed it to me it made me sick\u2014I couldn't tell\nhim anything about it\u2014it's something to do with a woman. This woman\nis a perfect crank. What she says is no good\u2014she's kind of funny. She's\nin body\u2014not likely to go out yet ; she live long time yet. You know\n-all you want to of her. She thinks she is smart, knows a good deal,\nbut she don't; she don't know so much as she thinks. She's married.\nIt's got yonr influence on it, too\u2014it was written for you\u2014you had some\nthing to do with it after she wrote it. [True, I copied the hieroglyphs.]\nit's no earthly use. Her names spell with an . . . [Three right letters\ngiven in last name.] Her first name, Lawlie, Lane, Laurie\u2014no, Laura.\n(That's wrong. You are nearly right, though, with the last name.) She's a\n.crank. I don't like her influence. She thinks she's very clever. She travels\n-a lot. (Very true.) She's going across the water soon. . . . [Bight\nname given\u2014first name and surname.] . . . [Further description of\n.character correctly given.]\n[But I want you to tell me where Dr. Hodgson is. He wants you to call\niin him this morning.] Oh, I see Hodgson near the water. Who are those\nchildren\u2014two of them ? He's been talking to two boys.\n1. This lady [meaning Mrs. Holmes] near the water. She's sitting in a\nchair [12.15] in front of the building. She's got a wrap round her. She\nthinks she is going in. She's got up to go now. Now she's patting both\nhands together\u2014clap hands. I like her. Her astral body is very clear, very\nlight. [Pause as if asleep.] I went right close to her. She has gone in and\nput on more wraps--you know, like a lady does\u2014and she is going out to tako\nwalk, a little walk for a little exercise.\n2. Do you know who iShdtun is\u2014 Shepard\u2014what you call him ? Don't\nyou remember a little fellow with you at same school I He was taken from\nschool on account of being ill. You were going to see him with a lady, to\nvisit him. He passed out. Charles\u2014Charlie\u2014a little lame fellow. (No, I do\nHot remember anything about it.) Can't you think ? [In a tone of great dis\nappointment.] (I do not remember a lame boy of that name.) [There was\na lame boy with curvature of spine at school by the name of Candler (I do\nnot remember first name unless it was Edward), for whom I remember feeling\ngreat pity, but 1 never spoke to him or visited him. I was friendly with his\nsisters\u2014the boys were in another house. I have heard nothing of them\n-since.]\n3. I see Hodgson in the country\u2014what's tho name of that phice ?-\ncountry\u2014in place where William is ! (There are a number of Williams in tho\nworld !) Yes, but Hodgson doesn't know fifty million Williams ! He is not\nin Charles' surroundings, but in with another William\u2014not William\n\u2022James. There's a lady that has light hair. I get his influence and the\nlady's together. Now Hodgson is with her. I get their influence together.\nI see him in surroundings of\u2014I get name William- not William James\u2014you\nhave to go across the water a little way and it is near the water\u2014a country\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 157\nlil;ico. He is not with Mrs. D now\u2014not there, but in another place.\n[Seeing he had made so many mistakes I asked a leading question to see\nwhether he would alter his track.] (Is he not in Boylston-place ?) No.\nLight-haired lady. He has been within a few days in surroundings of\nWilliam\u2014tall man, rather grey, and light-haired lady. Give me something of\nhis. (I have not anything unless this.) [Handing envelope, addressed by\nDr. Hodgson, which contained the \"string.\" Phinuit puts it to his forehead\nfor a time and went on :] He's writing now\u2014lots of books and papers around\nhim. Got his feet on something, I can't describe well. I thought he was by\nthe water ; that water is a tank thing that holds water, and he was washing\nhis feet and hands, that was what the water was. You see it confuses me,\nLulie. Mrs. Holmes was by the water. I saw her there, and I saw water\naround Hodgson, and I thought he was by the water, too, but he was washing\nhimself. He was doing something with the water. Now he has sat down\nand is writing. [12.30.]\n4. He is talking to someone named William, but not William James. I\nhave got the two mixed\u2014Mrs. Holmes and Hodgson. Now I get it clearer.\nHe takes a stick and is poking about in the funniest kind of way, and he\nseems as if he is talking and laughing to me, and saying all kinds of things,\nto me. He said : \"Oh, Phinuit, you're no good.\" Now he says, \"Now,\nPhinuit, you see if you can see that.\" And he has piled a lot of things one\non top of another [and in same breath] How's Kate ? You've sent her a book.\nYour father say it has reached its destination. [I had recently sent Kate a\nbook.] . . . [Returns to Dr. H.] Oh, now I see him open the window\n\u2014now he uses water. I see him brushing his hair. I see him drinking\nsomething from a cup. Now he's making a picture like a great big scrawl\u2014\nfunny looking thing ! Now I see him go to a closet-like thing and open it\nand take out something. (What is the \"something\"?) Looks like a dish of\nsome kind. Now he is walking up and down. Oh, now he's making such a\nhorrid-looking face. He has put his hands in his pocket and sat back and is\nlooking at something. He's taken a wreath, a funny thing, and put it on hi;,\nhead. What are those books and papers round him? He's got so many of\nthem. Are they his ? (I expect so.) He goes downstairs, pat-a-pat, and gets\nletter and goes upstairs, pat-a-pat. That's not his house. An old lady there.\n(Landlady ?) I don't know. W:ho's William ? A light-haired old lady.\n(Light-haired ?) Well, perhaps grey\u2014it's not black, anyhow. (Why, yes,\ngrey is light, it is not dark.) Yes, grey is light. I was right in saying\n\" light-haired.\" A gent has called with a book in his hand. (Do you\nknow him ?) He lectures or something. Hodgson has sat down and talks\nto someone.\nBoston, Mass., July 7th, 1891.\n[Comments by E. Hodgson on the sitting of July 6th, 1891.]\nThe piece of ribbon was sent to me by a lady relative of T. C. Hartshorn.,\nthe translator of Deleuze's Practical Instructions in Animal Magnetism, and\nthe first manuscript given to Phinuit at this sitting was in the handwriting,\nmany years ago, of Mr. Hartshorn, deceased. The ribbon had been worn\nby the lady. No one was \" lost \" in connection with the MSS., and the rest\nof what Phinuit said about these articles, though correct, can hardly be\nregarded as indicating any supernormal knowledge.\n\fMr. Ii. Hodgson.\nThe second lot of MSS. I had taken at a previous sitting, and Phinuit\n\u2022seemed disgusted with it, and declined to tell anything about it, saying that\nit was rubbish, and he didn't want to have anything to do with it, and\nthrowing it upon the floor. It was an almost undecipherable first draft of a\nlecture by a lady known to Miss Edmunds.\nMrs. Holmes made the following notes (either July 7th or July 8th,\n1891) upon seeing the record of the sitting :\u2014\n1. At 12 noon I was sitting on the sand at Onset beach, thinking intently\n-of Phinuit and willing him to see me. Supposing Dr. Hodgson to be with\nMrs. Piper, I also concentrated my mind upon him. I had on black wrap\ntrimmed with gold. At 12.15 I arose, patted the sand from my hands, and\nwent to dinner at the Washburn House. I went into the hall, took off my\nwrap, hung up my umbrella, had dinner, came out about 1 p.m.\u2014 possibly\n12.45\u2014and walked to my room in another street.\n2. I think possibly Phinuit heard the name diaries fihellon, and confused\nit with the lame boy. He is the father of the late Willis C. Shelton, the\ncelebrated boy organist.\n3. 1 was thinking much of my brother William, wondering if he could\nsee me as Phinuit suggested. I was also apostrophizing Phinuit, saying,\n*' Now come and try to see what 1 am doing. Are you here, Phinuit ? \" &c.\n4. Yes, Phinuit evidently \"got the two mixed, Mrs. Holmes and Dr.\nHodgson.\" ... I poked my parasol in the sand unconsciously, while\nthinking, but I piled up nothing.\n1 believe that Mrs. Piper and perhaps Phinuit also independently (since\nMrs. Holmes had a sitting alone on July 3rd) knew that Mrs. Holmes was at\nOnset (by the sea), so that there is nothing remarkable in Phinuit's state\nments about her, except, possibly, the description of her clapping her hands\nabout the time whe'n she was patting her hands together to get rid of the\nsand.\nThe notes of my own doings, which 1 made during the hour of the\nexperiment, are as follows : -\nJuly 6th, 1891.\n11.30. 12.\u2014Getting up with usual incidents boiling kettle, making\ntea, Ac.\n12 noon.\u2014In office, turning chair upside down, &s. Getting letters, thou\nwriting these notes.\n12.3.\u2014Pull up window blind.\n12.8.\u2014Put on jester's cap with bolls. Took it off.\n12.12.\u2014Walked about room with jester's hat on. Went into bedroom,\ntook up ginger-ale bottle, having cheroot in my mouth unlit. Light cheroot.\nPrinted \" sly veal \" on paper and placed it on top of desk, next little clock,\nsaying, \" Phinuit, do you see that I \" repeatedly and pointing to it with pen.\nOpen and read various letters, occasionally directing my attention to xly real.\n12.20.\u2014Put teacup away in cupboard.\n12.25.\u2014Postman comes in with registered letter from England.\n12.20.\u2014Read Mrs. Sidgwick's letter\u2014 envelope contains photograph, &c.\n12.35.\u2014Take out large shdl from box, and hold it up near sly veal. Take\npiece of brick from shell and fit it to the other fragment, Ac. Then read\nreports of Mrs. H.'s sittings.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 159\nThe description of my having bath, going downstairs to get letters,\ndrinking tea, &c., would have been true if given at the right time ; but these\nform part of the usual morning routine, and were known to Miss Edmunds\nand I believe also to Mrs. Piper. Phinuit's account of my talking and\nlaughing to him might, perhaps, have been a shrewd guess, sinoe he was aware\nthat I had arranged the experiment. His reference to my making \" a\npicture like a great big scrawl,\" putting the \" wreath, a funny thing \" on my\nhead, and the calling of \"a gent with a book in his hand \" might, indeed, be\nvague glimpses of my doings in printing the words \"sly veal,\" putting the\njester's cap on, and receiving the postman and signing in his little book for\nthe registered letter. I sat down at my desk to sign, and interchanged a few\nwords with the postman. This last incident must, have occurred only a very\nfew minutes before Phinuit's mention of the person calling. Taken\naltogether, there is enough coincidence to suggest that further experiments\nin this direction may be successful. It is worth while adding, with regard to\nirossible hypotheses, that there were three \" wreaths \" (which had been\nthere since Christmas) hanging in my room, and that I had contemplated\nplacing one of these on my head during the hour of experiment, but found\nthem too dusty.\n52. Dr. C L . July 1th, 1891.\n[See No. 38, p. 125.]\nBoston, Jidy 9<\/t, 1891.\nIn the beginning of the sitting I had with Mrs. Piper on 7th July, she, or\n\"Dr. Finlay,\" was uninteresting and vague, but gradually he grew interest\ning. He read some names of persons which 1 had written down on a paper,\nalthough Mrs. Piper was to all appearances sound asleep, and with her head\nbent down, so that she could not possibly see the paper. Asked to give some\ntest that I could tell Dr. Hodgson, he said : \" Do you know Dr. Hodgson ?\" and\nhe continued : \" You had a fire at your camp at night some time ago ; it did\nnot last very long, but caused some confusion. 1 tell you this because\nnobody could possibly have informed me of it.\" This is perfectly correct.\nAbout four months ago, in a very windy night, in Mexico, a fire started in\nmy camp, near the kitchen fire. The cook got his blankets and some of his\n\u2022clothes burnt, and most of our scanty provisions were destroyed, but the\n\u2022damage was nothing much to speak of, and I cannot recollect I ever men\ntioned this event any more. I feel at least certain I never spoke of it in\nU.S.; in fact it was too insignificant an accident ever lo be mentioned any\nmore.\nI then asked whether I had been in any danger on the road, to which lie\nanswered : \"You came nearly being shot at by the Indians. You were out\nwith another man shooting, and they thought you were after them, but see\ning that you were looking for deer they did not disturb you. This happened\nin the beginning of your journey, and you had no idea of any danger.\" In\nregard to this event, I suppose he refers to what took place about five weeks\nafter my start on my journey. Two of my men who had been out prospect\ning all day reported on their arrival in the evening that they had seen fresh\ntracks of Apache Indians. We were a large party, and I did not feel any\nanxiety about their attacking us. Next morning I went out alone with a\nMexican, shooting deer, and I heard in the course of the day a shot at some\n\flbO Mr. R. Hodgson.\ndistance. He said that this is what he refers to. The shot was fired off at\nsuch a distance tint it was not meant for me, I am sure. He said that it was\nonly intended to frighten me.\nHe next spoke of my family in Europe. They are all well, he said. My\nsister h ts just been, \" or is just going to he, married. My married sister\nhis just become a mother.\"1 This is news for mo, as I have had no mail for\na very long time, but as soon as I get news from abroad I will let you know\nwhether he is right.\nC L .\n53. Miss A. October 16tfi, 1891, 11 a.m.\nIn accordance with my request, Mrs. Piper arranged to give a sit\nting on Friday, October 16th, 1891. The name of the sitter was, of\ncourse, not mentioned to Mrs. Piper. She is a member of our Society,\nresiding in New York. I shall call her Miss A.\nOn October 19th she writes :\u2014.\n... In my judgment, the tests were very conclusive, and the infor\nmation given by Phinuit has proved correct in all three cases according tiv\nthe statements of the owners of the articles I took with me for the experi\nment. I enclose an account of the sitting which I have been enabled to\nmtke from some quite full notes made [during the sitting] by the friend who\naccompanied me. The delay has been in getting the various items of infor\nmation verified, as in the case of the locket the owner is unknown to me and\nc mid only be approached through a friend whom I could not get at till late\non Saturday.\n*****\nFor myself I am quite convinced, after this test, that objects do carry\nspheres, whereby the passive personality is enabled in trance to enter the\nfmrvr astral plane, wherein all the memories of past and present are indelibly\npictured. . . .\nFrom conversation with Miss A. I learn that additional points,\nwere given correctly at the sitting which have been omitted from the\nivport on the ground that the owners of the articles would object to\ntheir publication.\n[Account by Miss A.]\n*****\nSitter: \"I have brought some things I want you to tell me about.\"\nPhinuit: ''Do you know about them?\" S. : \"No, I want you to tell\nme.\" P. : \"I feel a very strong influence here. It is your father\u2014oh,\nvery strong. He is out of the body. . . . [Continued with some\ncharacteristics of my father, all quite true.] S. : \"I don't want to know\nanything about myself, or my relations. I want you to tell me some\nthing I don't know anything about.\" P. : \" Ha, well, I will do what\n1 can for you.\"\n[Here a locket was given to the medium and she took it, but imme\u2022-\ni This statement not correct, as Dr. L. writes to me from South America.

She is a good\ninfluence.\" P. : [Imperatively] \"Tell her to come here.\" [My friend came\nup close, and the medium felt over her face.] P. : \" Ha ! she is good ; but\nshe is not very well\u2014nervous\u2014I don't mean irritable, but weak nerves.\nShe thinks too much. She has had a great deal of trouble, but it has not\nbeen her own fault.\" [Hero Phinuit seemed inclined to go on about the\nlady in question, but she said : \"I don't want you to tell me anything about\nme,\" and I recalled him to the articles I had brought, and said I wanted him\nto tell mo about them.] P. : \" Out, oui\u2014yes, I will ; but I have to go a long\nway off.\"\n1. Lockct.\u2014[Here medium began fingering the locket all over.] 1'. :\n\"There is a lady connected with it. She has passed out of the body. A\nyoung lady, too. She speaks French. She is out of the body. Her name is\nAl\u2014Aleece\u2014Alice. Somebody here named Win\u2014Winnie\u2014William. [Here\nmedium began to cough hard.] He makes me cough. Oh! very bad cough ;\npassed out of the body with\u2014what you call it ? \u2014lung trouble, consumption.\nA lady comes with him. . . . I get the influence of a nice gentleman--\nhe writes a good deal\u2014a good head\u2014a big head\u2014a\u2014what you call it?\u2014\ngood mind; but he is immensely extravagant.\" S. : \"Can't you tell me\nwho this gentleman is ? Is he the one who coughs ? \" P. : \" No, no. This\nis another influence. He has the locket. He has it.\" S.: \" Do you mean\nit belongs to him?\" P.: \"Yes, he has it.\" [Here medium asked to\nhave the locket opened, and then rutibed it all over her head, and finally\nheld it for a full minute right on top of her head, breathing very\nheavily. I spoke, but got no answer. Then suddenly Phinuit's voice called\nout very loudly:] \"Ha! I have it. This carries the mother's and the\nfather's influence. It has hair\u2014ctw.vsnx\u2014two hairs in it. [Here medium\nbegan coughing again.] Too bad he has that cough. This takes me a long\nway\u2014 across water. [Coughed hard again.] Difficulty of the throat, but will\nimprove\u2014got better. Matured early\u2014good mind. Too bid he has this\ntrouble here.

[Very emphatically.] You find out and tell them I say so, and it is\nso. Gone away across water. He is in spirit now. He has a good friend\u2014\nCory\u2014Car\u2014Carrie\u2014Carey. Has a daughter living. . . . There is a\nspirit I get called Marie\u2014Mary\u2014an aunt of the lady who owned it\u2014a lady\nin the lxxly who had it.\" Here the medium wandered a little, saying to the\nsitter: \"Do you know sxnsona in ths body\u2014Hodgson? Hi gives me\nthings I don't know, and wants me to find out for him,\" and as Phinuit\nseemed inclined to talk of other matters, I recalled the locket to his remem\nbrance, whereupon he said : ] \" Oui, oui, but it takes me a long while, don't\nyou know^ to find out. I will find out\u2014but it takes me far back\u2014a long\nway. [Here medium began fumbling with locket again, rubbing it on her\nhead.] This has several influences about it. Did you know that ? Well, it\nis so. An aunt\u2014Marie\u2014Mary\u2014in the spirit. A good influence is connected\nwith it. She passed out of the body with something internal\u2014stomach\nwrong. . . .

I see a big building\u2014a gentleman\n.\u2014the gentleman with good mind. Edward, his son, studying books in a largo\nplace. . . .\" [Here medium seemed to be getting so confused that I\nsaid : \" That is enough about the locket,\" and placed another object in her\nhand belonging to a different person. I regret this now, and think it was a\nmistake, as, later on, the medium got the articles rather mixed, and if I had\nkept her to the one she would possibly have got clearer indications concerning\nit. After telling a good deal about the two other objects, Phinuit suddenly\nslid:] \"There was something around the locket\u2014give me what was\naround it.\" [The wrapper, an envelope folded several times, was handed to\nthe medium. She felt it all over and put it on top of her head, then\nsaid:] \"Several influences about this. I can't tell much. Feel a doctor\nstrongly ! \" [Medium threw the envelope away and asked for locket again.]\nP. : \" The gentleman who has this is physically well, and is fine, handsome\u2014\nwhat you call it !\u2014good, good-looking.\" [Here the sitter suggested the\nFrench phrase, \"Un bsl hommo,\" as Phinuit seemed to be waxing so enthu\nsiastic over the said gentleman's appearance. Phinuit said, \" (hn, oui,\" but\ndid not repeat the idiom.] P. \" He has light hair and complexion. He is a\nnice man, big head, writes a great deal. I see him in an oiHce\u2014he dictates\nto others.\" [Asked here what he meant exactly by dictating, as I thought\ngiving orders might be the sense intended ; but Phinuit explained that \" the\nothers around the nice gentleman wrote down what be was saying. '] P.:\n\" He is a good man\u2014I like his influence. Henry\u2014do you know Henry !\nHe will tell you who Henry is\u2014ask him. I feci Henry's influence strong.\n. . [Here medium interpolated some remarks having evident reference\nto the other objects given her.] . . . He has a good mind\u2014is intellectual.\nHe has a wife who is a nice lady. I got Ag\u2014Aug\u2014August \u2014A\u2014U\u2014G\u2014U\n\u2014S\u2014T.\" [Thinking this might be a date which would be useful I asked\nPhinuit about it, but could get nothing definite.] P. : \"The locket has\npassed through four hands. A child had it first\u2014given to a child.\" [Thia\nseemed to me so unlikely that I imagined Phinuit to be off the track, and to\nput him upon it again I said : \" Can't you tell me the name of the owner ! \"\nPhinuit replied he \" would try \"\u2014and spelled out G\u2014E, J\u2014E, Jose\u2014\nJosey\u2014G\u2014E, but seemed very uncertain, and constantly appealed to me for\ncorroboration, but I could not help at all as the Christian names were\nunknown to me.] P. : \" Marie\u2014the aunt out of the body\u2014nice, good\ninfluence. I get William with it. His son's name spells with an \"S.\"\n, . Je\u2014Josey\u2014no, that is not it. [I asked if Josephine was what he\nmeant.] No, no, J\u2014U\u2014D\u2014S\u20140\u2014N.

The gentleman had a\nfriend Cory\u2014Car\u2014Carey. . . , Jo\u2014Josey\u2014Joseph [called out suddenly]\n\u2014Joseph.\" S. : \" Is that the name of the nice gentleman f\" P.: \"There\nis a ' U ' and an ' E '\u2014Jose\u2014Joseph.\" [This last came quickly and with a\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 163\ncertain tone of conviction, so I asked again if that was the gentleman's name,\nbut Phinuit could not tell me.] . . .\nHere I thought the medium had been long enough in trance\u201445 minutes\n\u2014and I said to Phinuit : \"I think this is enough. I don't want to know\nany more.\" Whereupon Phinuit said hastily, angrily : \" Yon can't send mo\naway. I will go when I get ready.\" I explained that I thought the medium\nwould be too tired and that it was enough. P. : \"I will go when I get\nthrough. Don't you want me to find out something more for you?\" S.\n\"No, that is all I want to know about the locket, &c., ,&c.\" P. : [Eagerly.]\n\" Well, I will tell you about yourself, then.\" [Here followed some amusingly\ncorrect characteristics of my own, very drolly phrased. He pronounced mo\nto be physically well, but insisted that I slept with my head too high and that\nit was bad, must give it up ; mentioned some events likely to happen in the\nnear future which have vaguely shaped themselves in my own mind as among\nthe possibilities. Here I said again : \"I don't want to be told anything I\nknow already.\" P. : \" Don't you want to know any more 1 Ask me what\never you want \" [and after a little more talk said :] \" Now I am going,\" and\nshortly thereupon medium came out of the trance.\nWhat particularly struck me as very marked, and also curious in the\nwhole experience, was the docility of the passive personality\u2014calling itself\nPhinuit\u2014to the influence of a strong will. Even when I did not speak my\nthought, but mentally willed that certain subjects should not bo touched\nupon\u2014as, for instance, recollections of some deceased relations of mine\u2014it\nwas odd to note how the medium would glance off suddenly and go upon\nquite a different tack where my sphere was not armed against intrusion, such\nas temperamental facts, characteristics, habits, and so forth.\n2. Riiij.\u2014Sitter : \"Hero is a ring, Dr. Phinuit, I want you to tell me\nabout.\" P. : \" Do you know about it ? \" S. : \" No, I want you to tell me.'\nP. : \"I do not like the influence of this. It makes me feel bad\u2014mauvais\u2014\nbad, bad. Someone connected with it who is wrong in her head\u2014insane\u2014\na lady. She began to lose her mind at an early age. Oh ! it makes me feel\nbad. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Bad influence. . . . Someone connected with it passed\nout of the body with cancer. I do not like it.\" [Very positively said.]\nHere the medium seemed so distressed that the sitter took the ring from her\nhand and put a watch in place of it.\n3. Watch.\u2014P. : \"This is a better influence. [Here medium breathed\nvery heavily and was quiet for what seemed fully two minutes.] Ha ! it\ntakes me a long way. I can see the surroundings of that watch. [Here\nmedium wanted it opened for her.] It had a curious looking chain\u2014a\u2014\nwhat you call it !\u2014fob. It has a gentleman's influence. Came from across\nthe water many years ago. It has been in Italy. The gentleman has passed\nout of the body.

I get Elizabeth\nstrongly\u2014and Henry, too. Hemy gave it to Elizabeth\u2014is not that so ? \"\nS. : \"I don't know\u2014will have to ask.\" P. : \" Well, it is so. I say it is so\n\f1G4. Mr. R. Hodgson.\n[angrily], and you will find it so when you ask. ... I fuel the influence\nof someone who worked with great, round rolling things.\" [Various occupa\ntions here suggested, and finally Phinuit seemed to adopt the idea that it\nwas a printing house he meant, for he immediately after said :] \"There was\na brother who was a printer. He has handled this. He has passed out of\nthe body. He was Henry. Someone connected with it named Dav.\u2014Davis.\n. . . I see this now in a box with other things\u2014little things\u2014what\nyou call them ?\u2014trinkets\u2014kept in cotton. It makes me sad now. Eliza\nbeth\u2014Eliza\u2014don't you know Elizabeth ?

There was something around it \"\u2014and when wrapper was given her\nPhinuit resumed upon the locket.]\n[Notes.]\nNone of the three articles in question were mentioned to Mrs. Piper\nbefore she went into trance, nor were they even taken out of the bag in which\nthey were brought, or unwrapped, till they wore handed to the medium.\nThe sitter had handled them as little as possible, and knew nothing whatever\nof their associations, and in the matter of the locket did not even know the\nowner. Nor did the lady who took the notes at the sitting know anything\nwhatever concerning the articles.\n1. Luckct.\u2014I got the locket the evening before the sitting, through a friend\nwhom I met by accident in the street, and upon stating to her that I wanted\nsome personal article of an individual unknown to me, she said: \" We are\nclose to Mr. 's office and I will go in and ask him if he happens to have\nany trinket about him that he will lend.\" I waited outside in the street till\nmy friend returned with a little object wrapped up in a paper envelope and\nhanded it to me, saying that \" she knew what it was, but knew nothing of\nits history,\" &c. I was not told what the article was, nor was I acquainted\nwith the owner\u2014had never seen him and knew only his surname in a casual\nway. I did not look at the object given till the sitting with Mrs. Piper wa:i\nover and she had come out of the trance, when wo both examined it.\nThe gentleman who owns the locket bought it for himself when a child,\nquite a little fellow, with some money that had been given him as a present.\nIt had been put away for many years and quite forgotten ; seven or eight\nyears ago it was by chance recalled to his memory, which occasioned a search\nfor it, and, when found, he attached it to his watch-chain, and has worn it\nsince. The locket within has a picture of the owner's mother on one side,\nand the hair of his father and mother on the other. The gentleman who had\na cough, owner identifies as an uncle\u2014Charles by name\u2014a brother of his\nmother. He himself never saw this uncle Charles, but remembers, when a\nlittle boy, hearing him spoken of as out of health\u2014in his own words, \"A\nphysical wreck \" ; that he had consumption, and went to South Africa, where\nhe seemed for a time to improve, but finally died there. Owner knows no\nname like Cory or Carey in connection with the locket, and, in fact, cannot\nverify any of the names. He says they may all be correct for all he knows\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 1C5\nand belong to different members of his mother's family, who lived in Scot\nland, and he has never been brought into contact with any of them, his\nmother having been the eldest of a family of 10 or 12, and she married early\nand came to this country, where he was born and has always lived. He never\nknew any of his aunts, uncles, or cousins till a few years ago, when he went\nabroad and met certain ones who come in later in connection with this.\nHe says his mother might have had a sister Mary; he has a sister\nliving christened Mary Ann, now called Marian, and that at one time the\nlocket may have been in her keeping, but he is not sure of this.\nThe \"son, studying books in a large building upstairs,\" owner thinks is\nan allusion to a cousin of his, whose chance acquaintance he made in England\nsome years ago. This young cousin was the son of an aunt ; his father was\nvery proud of the lad's cleverness and took Mr. to see him. They\nfound the boy in a large building up some stairs, surrounded by books, which\nhe was studying. He cannot remember whether the young man's name was\nEdionrd or not, as he was merely introduced to him and never saw him\nafterwards, nor has even thought of the incident till brought up in this\n\u2022connection.\nThe doctor mentioned when the envelope was handled, owner thinks\nmay be an allusion to his father-in-law, who was a physician, and there was\na very intimate relation between them.\nKnows nothing about the name Judson, or Ellsworth.\nThinks the attempts to find out his own name were good, his names\nbeing Joseph George, and there is a \" IJ \" and an \" E \" in his surname. His\nmother's name was Elizabeth. Thinks the allusion to some throat difficulty,\nin contradistinction to the lung trouble connected with the uncle, refers to\nhis mother, for she suffered with a bronchial affection which occasioned\nsevere spasms in the throat for some years, and she finally died of the\nmalady\u2014has been dead many years. He thinks the allusions, \"good mind\n\u2014matured early,\" refer also to his mother, who was very quick, intelligent,\nand capable. He says the allusions to himself are true : he is very\nextravagant\u2014to use his own words : \" Has had two fortunes and has gone\nthrough both of them \" ; is physically well, has a big head ; writes, but\ndictates more\u2014says he is \" too lazy to write himself when he has others\nto do it for him.\" Has a wife, and she it was who hunted up and found the\nlocket, when it had been so long laid away and forgotten. Says it would be\nimpossible at this distance of time to verify any of the names. They are\nnone of them familiar to him except Elizabeth\u2014his mother's, and Alice\u2014that\nof his little niece [who is living, seven years old, and does not \"speak\nFrench \"].\nMy friend who asked Mr. for the locket says the description of him\nis excellent as to appearance. He has a big head, is intellectual\u2014is very\ngood-looking, and is a very kind, generous-hearted man. Mr. says he\nknows of nothing likely to call him away suddenly in the matter of his\nbusiness.\n2. Ring.-\u2014The ring and watch were handed to me just as I was going to\nkeep my appointment with Mrs. Piper. They were in a box, tied up. I\nhad never seen them, and did not even know of their existence till entrusted\nto my keeping. The owner is known to me, but not intimately, so that I\n\f1C6 Mr, B. Hodgson.\nknew nothing whatever of the circumstances connected with the articles,\nwhich the owner pronounces to be correctly stated in every particular, but\nhii\u00bb never before spoken of them to anyone.\nThe ring, an old-fashioned gold one, with English hall-marks on the\ninner rim, and a few small stones set in the middle, was given to present owner\nby a young man named John . Owner always suspected him of having-\nstolen it, as he was of bad character, and would not say how he had come by\nit. Owner never would wear it, and has often thought of throwing it away,\nbut has kept it in a box with some other old-time trinkets done up in cotton,\nthe watch being one of them.\nThe young man's father owed a large sum of money to the mother of the\npresent owner of ring, but there having been no papers to prove the loan,\nupon the mother's decease the father of John [who gave the ring] repu\ndiated the debt altogether, which naturally caused much trouble and bad\nfeeling. The father died of cancer in the stomach. Present owner has a\nsister, who, at the age of three years, had a great fright from being left alone\nin a burning house. When rescued she could make no audible sound, and\ngradually became entirely idiotic. She is now fifty years, old. Her name is\nElizabeth\u2014was called Eliza and Lizzie. Present owner of ring had sole\ncharge of her for many years, but on her becoming worse she was placed in\nan institution for the insane, where she now is. She has always been a great\ncare and anxiety to the present owner of ring.\n3. WuUh. \u2014The watch is also old-fashioned, with a gold engraved back\nand dial, and is of Geneva make. It was bought by an uncle of present\nowner while he was abroad. His name was Joseph, and he lived quite a while\nin Italy. Does not know of his having been a printer, but may possibly have\nbeen one. He always wore the watch, and at his death it came to the\nmother of present owner. The mother used often to give the watch to the\ninsane daughter, Elizabeth, as it amused her and kept her quiet. The owner\ncannot identify the building so minutely described, but thinks there is some\nwhere in the family a picture of some such house, and will endeavour to look\nit up. Present owner has another sister living, named Annie. John was\nthe name of the young man who gave the ring. Joseph the name of the\nuncle who had the watch. Owner keeps in same box with watch and ring a\nlittle crystal seal with Joseph engraved on it, which belonged to the uncle.\nJesse (not Jen-nie) was the name of the mother of present owner.\n[Miss A.]\nI have ascertained from Miss A. that her companion at the sitting\nhad never seen Mrs. Piper before. This lady herself writes :\u2014\nOctober 21sl, 1891.\nTo Mk. HoiKiSOn,\u2014I desire to verify Miss [A.'s] statement, that I knew\nnothing of the articles submitted to Mrs. Piper during the sitting at her\nhouse recently.\nI know the owner of the watch and ring, and though my acquaintance\nwith her is less than Miss [A.'s] I know her to be a truthful and reliable\nperson, and I believe her report relating to the history of these articles to be\nstrictly true.\n\fObservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance 167\nI have also received the following statement :\u2014\nOctober 2Ut, 1891.\nThis is to certify, as the owner of the ring and watch given to Miss [A.]\nfor the sitting with Mrs. Piper, that I am positive Miss [A.] did not know any\nof the family or other circumstances connected with the articles, all of which\nwere truly stated by Mrs. Piper.\nThe day before the sitting I had taken a brooch for Miss [A.] to use in\nthe sitting, but on second thoughts I believed the ring and watch would be\nbetter, as I wanted to find out, if possible, who first had the ring, and how\nthe person who gave it to me got it. I brought the ring and watch to Miss\n[A.] the next morning in a box with an elastic band round it, and told her\nnothing but that a ring and watch were inside.\nI have never spoken to her of our family connections, and she could\nknow nothing about them.\nThe owner of the locket replies to my questions :\u2014\nQ. Were any names or initials on locket ? A. No. Q. Had Uncle\nCharles any other Christian name 1 A. Don't reme'hiber. Q. Was he the\nbrother of owner's mother ? A. Yes. Q.

Myers.\nOUK\u20acTl TVpoff,a\natSdray nAa Ktopwv imtp 'Hpa,c\\tos irepdv (ipapt'v\n6vf,t, riva npos d\\\\o$anav\naxpav tpbv n\\6ov irnpapclfittu ;\nPlSDAr.\nWhatever else a ghost may be, it is probably one of the most com\nplex phenomena in nature. The briefest and simplest veridical apparition\nsuggests a series of questions which as yet we are unable even to formu\nlate with any distinctness. Let us consider for a moment how many\ndifficulties, and of what various kinds, are involved in the very attempt\nto grasp distinctly the nature of any such occurrence. In the first\nplace there is the evidential question. We have to satisfy ourselves\nthat the alleged apparition was actually seen, and that it corresponded\nwith some objective event in such a way as to raise a strong presumption\nthat it had more than a merely subjective origin ; \u2014was not due, I mean,\nto some condition which affected the percipient alone, and involved the\noperation of no other intelligence. This evidential question is of course\nof primary importance ; and our efforts have mainly been, and for a\nlong time yet must mainly be directed towards the attainment of an\nanswer which shall carry conviction to all unbiassed minds. But\nwhile still keeping the evidential question foremost in our regard, we\nmay of course at the same time endeavour to discuss some of the further\nquestions to which the evidence, when duly sifted, is found to point.\nThus we may ask ourselves what proportion the apparitions which we\ndeem veridical bear to the phantasmal figures for which we can advance\nno such claim. We may ask, again, what proportion the supposed\nveridical apparitions of the dead bear to veridical apparitions of living\npersons, or of persons at the point of death. Such questions are likely\nto be answered more fully than heretofore when the results of the\nCensus of Hallucinations, now being conducted in several countries for\nreport to the approaching International Congress of Experimental\nPsychology, are laid before the public.\nFurthermore it is natural to inquire as to the relation between the\nfrequency of veridical apparitions and the time which has elapsed since\nthe death of the person whose phantasm is perceived. A first provi\nsional answer to this question was attempted by Mr. Gurney and\n\fOn Indicat ions of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 171\nmyself. (Vol. V., p. 403, sqq.) Once more, before actually committing\nourselves to any hypothesis involving so extreme a supposition as the\ncontinued action of dead men, we may naturally inquire, as Mr.\nPodmore has done (Vol. VI., p. 229, sqq.), whether these soi-disant\napparitions of the dead may not still be explained by the more familiar\nconception of telepathy between the living. In my reply, which imme\ndiately follows Mr. Podmore's paper, I have set forth certain reasons\nwhich seem to me to make this explanation insufficient. I am there\nfore, for my part, bound to go on and to face the enormous difficulties\ninvolved in the very idea of intercourse between an incarnate and a\ndiscarnate mind.\nOur attempt to study such intercourse may begin at either end of\nthe communication,\u2014with the percipient or with the agent. Wo\nshall have to ask, How does the incarnate mind receive the message 1\nand we shall have to ask also, How does the discarnate mind originate\nand convey it t\nNow it is by pressing the former of these two questions that we\nhave, I think, the best chance at present of gaining fresh light. So\nlong as we are considering the incarnate mind we are to some extent\nat least on known ground ; and we may hope to discern analogies in\nsome other among that mind's operations to that possibly most perplex\ning of all its operations which consists in taking cognisance of\nmessages from unembodied minds, and from an unseen world. I think,\ntherefore, that \" the surest way, though most about,\" as Bacon would\nsay, to the comprehension of this sudden and startling phenomenon\nlies in the study of other rare mental phenomena which can Iio\nobserved more at leisure ;- -just as \" the surest way, though most about,\"\nto the comprehension of some blazing inaccessible star has lain in the\npatient study of the spectra of the incandescence of terrestrial substances\nwhich lie about our feet. I am in hopes that by the study of various\nforms of subliminal consciousness, subliminal faculty, subliminal per\nception, we may ultimately obtain a conception of our own total\nbaing and operation which may show us the incarnate mind's percep\ntion of the discarnate mind's message as no isolated anomaly, but an\norderly exercise of natural and innate powers, frequently observed in\naction in somewhat similar ways.\nBut although approaching the problem with most hope by this\npurely terrene inquiry, we must not neglect any indication which the\nevidence offers as to the other and remoter side of the net of com\nmunication ;\u2014as to the condition in which the discarnate mind appears\nto be when communicating, or the apparent motive of his message, or\nthe apparent knowledge which he possesses either of what may be\npassing in an unseen world, or of what has passed in this world since\nhis earthly death.\n\f172 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nOn none of these points, I may say at once, have we as yet any\nthing more than scattered indication and dubious inference. Yet none\nthe less are we bound to set forth our fragments of knowledge as best\nwe may; -in the hope that the direction of attention to these various\npoints in turn may lead to wider interest in the subject, more intelli\ngent observation, more careful record.\nAnd having now a group of unpublished cases (largely due to Dr.\nHodgson's energy in collection) to offer to our readers, I take occasion\nto arrange them in such a way as may throw some little light on the\nlast of the problems on which I have touched;\u2014namely, the question of\ncontinuous knowledge ;\u2014or, How far do phantasms of the dead indicate\nany acquaintance with terrestial facts of which they were not aware\nwhile they yet lived on earth V\nAnd here it looks as though we might best begin by asking whether\nthese phantasms always show a memory of facts which they did know\nwhile on earth ;\u2014whether we can assume that they start with at least\nthat equipment, while we inquire into any fresh knowledge which they\nmay since have gained. But this difficult question may be, I think,\nmore conveniently kept separate from the inquiry which I now propose,\nand discussed elsewhere in connection with the more general question of\nthe persistence or otherwise of the same chain of memory in different\npsychical states.\nI proceed, therefore, to our more limited question. And here in\nthe first place it i3 evident that the narratives with which we have to\ndeal may be classed in three main groups, with reference to this special\ninquiry. First we shall have cases where the phantasm is such as to\ngive no indication whatever of either knowledge or ignorance of what\nhas occurred on earth since the assumed agent's death. Secondly, the\nphantasm may indicate ignorance of what has thus occurred. Thirdlv,\nit may indicate knowledge;\u2014and this in very varying degrees,\u2014from a\nmere realisation of some scene immediately following death, up to a\nmore than terrene comprehension of complex circumstances,\u2014a more\nthan terrene power of predicting events yet to be.\nOn the first (and largest) of these three groups I need not linger long.\nAll will admit that the phantasm is usually so fugitive a thing that,\nbeyond its mere identification with some departed person, little or\nnothing can be inferred in detail. 1 will cite in illustration a case\nrecently received.\nG. 203.\nWe owe this case to the kindness of Lady Gore Booth, from whom I first\ni In a paper in Vol. VI., p. 13, \u00ab(\/i\/., I have arranged another batch of material\nin a somewhat similar way, and have given references to other published cases which\nI need not here repeat. As the evidence increases it becomes needful to keep many\nnarratives in mind, if we are to understand any of them aright.\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, dc. 173\nheard the account by word of mouth. Her son (then a schoolboy aged 10) was\nthe percipient, and her youngest daughter, then aged 15, also gives a first\nhand account of the incident as follows :\u2014\nLissadell, Sligo, February, 1891.\nOn the 10th of April, 1889, at about half-past nine o'clock a.m., my\nyoungest brother and I were going down a short flight of stairs leading to the\nkitchen, to fetch food for my chickens, as usual. We were about half way\ndown, my brother a few steps in advance of me, when he suddenly said\u2014\n\"Why, there's John Blaney, I didn't know he was in the house!\" John\nBlaney was a boy who lived not far from us, and he had been employed in\nthe house as hall-boy not long before. I said that I was sure it was not he,\n(for I knew he had left some months previously on account of ill-health), and\nlooked down into the passage, but saw no one. The passage was a long one,\nwith a rather sharp turn in it, so we ran quickly down the last few steps, and\nlooked round the corner, but nobody was there, and the ouly door he could\nhave gone through was shut. As we went upstairs my brother said, \" How\npale and ill John looked, and why did he stare so 1 \" I asked what he was\niloing. My brother answered that he had his sleeves turned up, and was\nwearing a large green apron, such as the footmen always wear at their work.\nAn hour or two afterwards I asked my maid how long John Blaney had been\nback in the house? She seemed much surprised, and said, \"Didn't you\nhear, miss, that he died this morning I \" On inquiry we found he had died\nabout two hours before my brother saw him. My mother did not wish that\nmy brother should be told this, but he heard of it somehow, and at once\ndeclared that he must have seen his ghost.\nMabel Olive Gore Booth.\nThe actual percipient's independent account is as follows :\u2014\nMarch, 1891.\nWe were going downstairs to get food for Mabel's fowl, when I saw John\nBlaney walking round the corner. I said to Mabel, \"That's John Blaney ! \"\nbut she could not see him. When we came up afterwards we found he was\ndead. He seemed to me to look rather ill. He looked yellow ; his eyes\nlooked hollow, and he had a green apron on.\nMordaitnt Gore Booth.\nWe have received the following confirmation of the date of death : \u2014\nI certify from the parish register of deaths that John Blaney (Dunfore)\nwas interred on the 12th day of April, 1889, having died on the 10th day of\nApril, 1889. P. J. Shemachs, C.C.\nThe Presbytery, Ballingal, Sligo.\n10<\/i February, 1891.\nLady Gore Booth writes :\u2014 May 31\u00abt, 1890.\nWhen my little boy came upstairs and told us he had seen John Blaney,\nwe thought nothing of it till some hours after, when we heard that he was\ndead. Then for fear of frightening the children, I avoided any allusion to\nwhat he had told us, and asked everyone else to do the same. Probably by\nnow he has forgotten all about it, but it certainly was very remarkable,\nespecially as only one child saw him, and they were standing together. The\n\f174 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nplace where he seems to have appeared was in the passage outside the pantry\ndoor, where John Bbuiey's work always took him. My boy is a very matter\nof fact sort of boy, and I never heard of his having any other hallucination.\nG. Gore Booth.\nNow this apparition\u2014unless we explain it as a telepathic impres\nsion projected at the moment of death and rejnaining latent for some\nhours before it attained externalisation\u2014may possibly be taken as show\ning something of continued memory in the departed boy. Something of\nhim or from him, it may be said, reverted to well-known haunts, and\nwas discerned in habitual surroundings. But even of this there is no,\nsure indication. If it be suggested that the dead boy waited to mani\nfest until his young master reached a suitable spot, it may be replied\nthat the living boy's presence in that spot merely enabled him to\ndiscern some influence which might have been discernible in that spot\npossibly at any moment during some hours, if the fitting percipient had\nbeen at hand. Or else, and perhaps more simply, we may suppose that,\nthere was a mere influence transmitted from the departed mind to the\nliving mind, which influence the living mind discerned when in sur\nroundings in which its own recollection of the decedent might most\nreadily be evoked.i\nLet us turn to the second of our three groups, the cases (if such\nthere be) where the phantasm appears to show ignorance of what has\ntaken place since the agent's death. May we ascribe to this group\ncertain cases already published where the phantasm seems to return to\ni As bearing upon the terror which is popularly supposed to be inspired by any\nmanifestation of the so-called \" supernatural,\" it is worth remarking that in cases like\nthe above, where the death was not known, and the phantasm appears in natural\nsurroundings, it frequently happens that no terror at all is felt by the percipient. On\nthe other hand, when the death is known (and the apparition, therefore, of no eviden\ntial value), there may be extreme terror. But that terror is in itself no proof that the\nphantasm in such cases is anything more than a mere after-image. I subjoin a curious\ncase which was sent to Dr. Hodgson by Mr. Frank Cornell, of Athens, Ont., to whom\nMr. Barnes' first letter is addressed.\n\" In accordance with your request to give my recent experience for the benefit of\nthe Society for Psychical Research,I would say : On the 4th of the present month my\ngrandmother, Jane Klizabeth Barnes, died, and was buried on the Gth. On Saturday\nevening, the 7thinst., my father and mother drove over to my uncle's, with whom my\ngrandmother had resided many years previous to her death, leaving me alone. I had\nno thought of being afraid, and as it became dark I lit a lamp and placed it on a table\nin the room ; took my pipe and began to smoke. 1 sat thus for some time thinking\nover business matters, but my thoughts were in no way connected with my grand\nmothcr.\nHaving finished smoking, I laid my pipe on a stand near by, and my dog coming\nto inc. jumped upon my lap, and I 'began to play with him. All at once I became\nconscious of the presence of someone in the room, and on looking up I plainly saw my\ngrandmother sitting on a couch directly in front of me. I was not frightened at first,\nbut astonishment held me fast. I noticed her dress, the same she usually wore when\nalive ; one hand rested on her lap, the other was by her side. I noticed particularly\nevery feature ; her face wore the same expression as in life. The distance between us\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, dc. 175\na place rather than to a person ] where, perhaps, it seems to be looking\nfor a person who is no longer in the accustomed place ?\nI do not think that we can safely thus interpret these cases of local\nattraction. For aught we know, the impulse of the discarnate mind\nmay have gone forth to the familiar house quite irrespective of its\npresent occupants. Or in some of these cases our nearest analogy may not\nba the projection of an impulse, but rather the persistence of a picture.\nTt may be that the departed person's semblance is seen in that house\nbecause he once has been there ; and not because, in any sense, he is\nthere still.\nBut there are other cases where the phantasm seems to be not\nmerely attracted to a place, but absorbed in some train of thought\nwhich was natural at the time of death, but has since become inappro\npriate. Thus in Mr. Lewis's case (Proceedings, Vol. III., p. 93) the\nclergyman whose visit the decedent had desired, and who would gladly\nhave paid that visit, had he known of the decedent's illness, saw the\nphantasm, two days after death, pursuing him with a gaze of reproach.\nThe decedent thus appeared to prolong a feeling of resentment which he\nmight have learnt to be unjust.\nVery similar is a case quoted in Annates des Sciences Psijchiques,\nNo. I., p. 31, sqq., and which may be summarised as follows :\u2014\u2022\n^' Observation de Montpellier.\nThis case consists of a dream of distressing vividness, dreamt by M.\nNoell, now a chemist at Cette, at 4 a.m., November 24th, 1869.\nwas not more than ten feet. Not until I had noted every particular did I realise the\nstrangeness of the occurrence. No sooner had I thought of this than fear seized me,\nand I started for the door, intending to go to a neighbour some ten feet distant. I\nremember nothing further until I found myself on the bed in my neighbour's house.\nI am twenty-four years of age, have a good common school education, am strictly\ntemperate, never believed in ghosts, am not a spiritualist, had not been reading any\nexciting literature. I can offer no explanation ; can say, however, that it all happened.\nAthens, Leeds Co., Ont. Samuel E. Baknbs.\"\nFebruary Uth, 1891.\n\"This is to certify that on the evening of the 7th of February, about 7.30 o'clock,\nI heard something fall against the door, and on opening it I found SarnnA Barnes in an\ninsensible condition. I took him in and used means to restore him. After some time\nhe said, ' I have seen,' but was too weak to finish. In the course of an hour he was\nsufficiently restored to talk, and related the story as given above. I have known\nB.trnes for years, and believe his testimony to be reliable. yfu Pkabce \"\nAthens, February Uth, 1891.\nMr. Barnes further writes to Dr. Hodgson under date January 22nd, 1892 :\u2014\n\" I can say I have never fainted or become unconscious in my life except when I\nsaw the apparition of my grandmother. Sauvkl Barnes.\"\nMr. Cornell adds that Mr. Barnes does not remember anything regarding the\nhehaviour of the dog, and has never had any other psychical experience. This may\nhave been nothing more than an after-image ; but the shock given was greater than in\nmost veridical cases.\n\f17G Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nHe first mentions the fact (confirmed by the register of deaths) that his\nfavourite sister died suddenly from diphtheria, at Perpignan, at 5 a.m. [the\nofficial register says at 4], November 23rd, 1869. She had been perfectly\nwell up to within 13 hours of death. The telegrams which the family sent\nto the absent brother were not delivered, owing to the fault of a servant.\n\" During the night of November 23-24,\" he proceeds, in a letter to Dr.\nDariex, dated Cette, January 7th, 1891, \"I was the prey of a terrible\nhallucination. I had returned to my lodgings at 2 a.m., my mind at rest, and\nstill dwelling upon the pleasure which I had felt during the 22nd and 23rd,\nwhich had been spent in a party of pleasure. I went happily to bed and fell\nasleep in five minutes.\n\"At 4 a.m. I saw before me the face of my sister, pale, covered with blood,\nand lifeless, and I heard a piercing, reiterated cry : ' What are you doing,\nmy Louis ? Come ! come ! ' In my agitated sleep I seemed to take a\ncarriage ; but alas ! in spite of superhuman efforts I could not make it go on.\nAnd I still saw my sister's face, and heard that same cry.\n\"I woke suddenly\u2014my face red, my head on fire, my throat dry, but my\nbody streaming with perspiration. ... At eleven I reached the phar\nmaceutical school, a prey to an insurmountible melancholy. Questioned\nby my comrades, I told them the crude fact, as I had experienced it.\n. [He describes how his surviving sister came to tell him of his loss\nand ths terrible shock which the news g.tve him.] Two hours afterwards,\nwhen I had become more calm, I described to my sister my hallucination\nof the previous night.\"\nMile. Therese Noell fully confirms her brother's recollection of the circum\nstances, and of his having at once informed her of the hallucination or\ndream.\nNow here also the decedent appears still to be feeling grieved sur\nprise at her brother's absence from her death-bed ; although a clair\nvoyant knowledge, had she acquired such knowledge by death, might\nhave informed her that his absence was due only to his non-receipt of\ncertain telegrams.i\nWe may, however, doubt whether in such cases there is any fresh\nrealisation of the circumstances on the decedent's part, or whether the\nmood exhibited may not be a mere dreamlike prolongation of the dis\ntress or anxiety which was felt at the moment of death. I cannot\nrecall any instances where the phantasm of a person who has been dead\nfor more than a few days has shown any definite misapprehension of\nfacts. And this notion of a prolonged dream is countenanced by cer-\ni Those who believe iu telepathy, but are unwilling to extend it beyond tin-\ngrave, may urge that there was in fact a living mind \u2014that of Mile. Therese Noell\u2014\nwhich was still perplexed as to the brother's absence,\u2014and which perhaps dwelt on him\nwith special intensity as the hour of the death came round. That the interval htm\njust 24 hours is rendered highly probable by the fact that M. Xoell has not\nhimself perceived this coincidence ;\u2014but has placed his sister's death at 5 (instead of\n4), and, through some confusion, describes his own vision at 4 a.m. as occurring\n18 hours after the death.\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 177\ntain cases where the decedent exhibits traces of his fatal malady ;\neither in his worn appearance, as in Mrs. Lewin's case (Proceedings,\nVol. V., p. 462), or in the phantasmal sound of coughing, as in a case\ncontributed by the Dowager Marchioness of Downshire, and not\nyet published, though printed in the S.P.R. Journal, October, 1890,\np. 308.\nG. 196. Visual and Auditory.\nThe percipient in this case is dead, and the account is, therefore, at\nsecond hand as regards his experience ; but, as will be seen, it is at first\nhand for certain important details.\nDecember 19th, 1889.\nIt may have been in 1850 or soon after. We had a French cook, who\nhad been several years with us, named Cartel. It was in July, when he\ncaught a violent cold, which became inflammation of the lungs, &c, and the\nman was dangerously ill. Two doctors attended him. The weather being\nextremely hot, and his bedroom over the kitchen, I had him moved into a\nbest spare bedroom, where he continued very ill and had a fearful cough.\nAt last the doctors said they could do no more for him, and he was dying.\nI asked their permission to try mesmerism. Of course they laughed at me,\nbut admitted it could do no harm. I sent for Fisher, a professional mes\nmerist. Cartel was mesmerised three times a day, and rapidly improved. At\nthe end of a fortnight the doctors (who had not given up attending him)\npronounced him out of danger, and advised Fisher being sent away. He\nwent, but after a day or two poor Cartel began to fail again, and died,\nthough I had Fisher back. As I mentioned, it was eery hot weather, and,\nafter the poor man's death, I had the room in which he died dismantled, the\nwindow left open day and night, and the door locked. It remained so for\ntwo or three months, as well as I remember, and then, as we were going to\nhave the house full, the furniture was all replaced, and Mr. Popham, of\nLittlecote, was put into that bedroom. A day or two afterwards Mr.\nPopham said, \"I have seen a ghost.\" He then told us that the previous\nnight he was reading in bed, when he heard a man coughing fearfully in his\nroom. He could not understand it, as he could see no ime, though he\nsearched the room. He went on reading, and then suddenly looking up he\nsaw a head (only) at the foot of his bed. He described the features, which\nwere those of Cartel, exactly, though Mr. Popham hite never seen him, and\nhad never heard of his illness or death. After that several people slept in\nthe room, but nothing was ever seen or heard.\nC. DOW.NSHIrB.\nVirgil's assertion as to the persistence of bodily evils \u2014\nNon tamen omne malum miseris, nec funditus omnes\nCorporee excedunt pestes\u2014\nmay contain much of truth ; yet we can hardly suppose that the\ncentral current of the intelligence of a departed spirit is unaware that\nhe has at any rate shaken himself clear of pulmonary microbes.\nIt is true that we sometimes find a moral situation apparently much\n\f178 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfurther prolonged, as in the following case, which seems intermediate\nbetween such cases as Mrs. Lewin's and a \"haunt\" of the traditional\ntype.\nG. 205.\nThe following narrative was sent to us with the true names, but with\na request to conceal them, and some local details, on account of the painful\nnature of the incident described.\nOur informant, whom I will call Mrs. M., writes under date December\n15th, 1891.\n''Before relating my experience of htving soon a ghost, I should like my\nreaders thoroughly to understand that I had not the slightest idea that the\nhouse in which my husband and I were living was haunted, or that the family\nresiding there for many years before us had had any family troubles. The\nhouse was delightfully situated [&c.]. The house being partly new and partly\nold, we occupied the old part for our sleeping apartments. There were two\nstaircases leading to them, with a landing and window, adjoining a morning\nsitting-room. One night on retiring to my bedroom about 11 o'clock, I\nthought 1 heard a peculiar moaning sound, and someone sobbing as if in great\ndistress of mind. I listened very attentively, and still it continued ; so I\nraised the gas in my bedroom, and then went to the landing window of which\nI have spoken, drew the blind aside ;\u2014and there on the grass was a very beauti\nful young girl in a kneeling posture before a soldier, in a general's uniform,\nsobbing, and clasping her hands together, entreating for pardon ;\u2014but, alas !\nhe only waved her away from him. So much did I feel for the girl, that\nwithout a moment's hesitation I ran down the staircase to the door opening\nupon the lawn, and begged her to come in, and tell me her sorrow. The\nfigures then disappeared ! Not in the least nervous did I feel then ;\u2014went\nagain to my bedroom, took a sheet of writing-paper and wrote down what I\nhad seen. [Mis. M. has found and sent us this paper. The following words\nare written in pencil on a half sheet of notepaper : \" March 13th, 1886. Have\njust seen visions on lawn :\u2014a soldier in general's uniform,\u2014a young lady\nkneeling to him. 11.40 p.m.\"] My husband was away from home when this\nevent occurred, but a lady friend was staying with me, so I went to her bed\nroom and told her that I had been rather frightened with some noises ;\u2014could\nI stay with her a little while ? A few days afterwards I found myself in a\nvery nervous state ; but it seemed so strange that 1 was not frightened at the\ntime.\n\" It appears the story is only too true. The youngest daughter of this\nvery old, proud family had had an illegitimate child ; and her parents and\nrelatives would not recognise her again, and she died broken-hearted. The\nsoldier was a near relative (also a connection of my husband's) ; and it was in\nvain she tried to gain his\u2014the soldier's\u2014forgiveness. [In a subsequent letter\nSir X. Y.'s career is described. He was a distinguished officer.]\n\"So vivid was my remembrance of the features of the soldier that some\nmonths after the occurrence, when I happened to be calling with my husband\nat a house where there was a portrait of him, I stepped before it and said :\n' ^ hy, look ! There is the General ! ' And sure enough it litis.\"\nIn a subsequent letter Mrs. M. writes : \" I did see the figures on the lawn\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, d-c. 179\nafter opening the door leading on to the lawn ; and they by no means dis\nappeared instantly, but more like a dissolving view, viz., gradually ; and I did\nnot leave the door until they had passed away. It was impossible for any real\npersons to act such a scene. . . . The General was born and died in [the\nhouse where I saw him]. ... I was not aware that the portrait of the\nGeneral was in that room [where I saw it] ; it was the first time I had been\nin that room. The misfortune to the poor girl happened in 1847 or 1848.\"\nMrs. M. then mentions that a respectable local tradesman, hearing of the\nincident, remarked : \" That is not an uncommon thing to see tier about the\nplace, poor soul ! She was a badly used girl.''\nMr. M. writes as follows, under date December 23rd, 1891 :\u2014\n\"I have seen my wife's letter in regard to the recognition of Sir X. Y.'s\npicture at . Nothing was said by me to her on the subject ; but knowing-\nthe portrait to be a remarkably goixl likeness I proposed calling at the\nhouse [which was that of a nephew of Sir X. Y.'s], being anxious to see what\neffect it would have on my wife. Immediately on entering the room sho\nalmost staggered back, and turned pale, saying\u2014 looking hard at the picture\u2014 .\n' Why, there's the General ! ' . . . Being a connection of the family, I\nknew all about the people, but my wife was then a stranger, and I had never\nmentioned such things to her ; in fact, they had been almost forgotten.\"\nThis case may remind us of Mr. Gumey's description of a some\nwhat similar vision (Vol. V., p. 41rt), as suggesting \" the survival of a\nmere image, impressed, we cannot guess how, on we cannot guess\nwhat, by [the agent's] physical organism ; and perceptible at times to\nthose endowed with some cognate form of sensitiveness.\" We are,\nindeed, always uncertain as to the degree of the decedent's active par\nticipation in post-mortem phantasms,\u2014as to the relation of such mani\nfestations to the central current of his continuing individuality. But\nit is in dealing with these persistent pictures of a bygone earth-scene\nthat this perplexity reaches its climax. They may, as I have said else\nwhere, be the mere dreams of the dead ; \u2014affording no true indication\nof the point which the decedent's knowledge or emotion has really\nreached.\nOil the whole, then, and speaking from an avowedly inadequate in\nduction, I see no clear evidence that the phantasm of a person who has\nbeen dead for more than a few days has shown definite ignorance of\nevents which have occurred on earth since his departure. We have\nnow to consider, on the other hand, to what extent phantasms have\nshown definite knowledge, of such posthumous events.\nThis question is in the first place complicated by the difficulty of\ndetermining of what events the decedent was in fact aware\u2014by normal\nor supernormal means \u2014before his decease. I add here the word super\nnormal, because there is some evidence of a tendency to clairvoyance\non the part of dying persons. This is shown in some of our rare\n\"reciprocal\" cases, where the dying man not only produces a tele\npathic impression upon some person at a distance, but is also apparently\n\f180 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\naware of having in some way visited that person. Now it is obvious\nthat in order to produce an evidential instance of this sort of reciprocity\nsome very unusual circumstances must occur in conjunction. The\ndying agent must mention the fact of his clairvoyant perception ; and\nthe distant friend whom the decedent supposes himself to be in some\nway visiting must be so constituted and situated as to be able to realise\nand remember the so-called visit thus made to him. Each of these\n.conditions is rare ; and their accidental conjunction will therefore be\nrarer still.\nIt is possible that we might learn much were we to question dying\npersons, on their awakening from some comatose condition, as to their\nmemory of any dream or vision during that state. If there has in fact\nbeen any such experience it should be at once recorded, as it will\nprobably fade rapidly from the patient's supraliminal memory, even if\nhe does not die directly afterwards. A curious case was published in\nPhantasms of the Living (Vol. II., p. 305), where a dying man returns,\njis it were, from the gates of death expressly to announce that he has\nhad a vision, or \" paid a visit,\" of this kind\u2014which \" visit,\" however,\nit was not possible to verify. A somewhat similar instance, but with\nultimate recovery of the patient, Dr. Wiltse, was printed in the St.\nLouis Medical and Surgical Journal, November, 1889, and in the\nMid-Continental Review, February, 1890. Dr. Wiltse has since ob\ntained for us the sworn depositions of the witnesses of importance.\nThe experience is long, and for the most part of a thoroughly dreamlike\ntype ; but in any view it is extremely unusual, nor can it be fairly\nunderstood from extracts alone. I quote, therefore, the essential part\n\u2022of the case in full.\nG. 20.\"..\nAfter describing his gradual sinking under an unusual disease \u2014typhoid\nfever with subnormal temperature and pulse\u2014Dr. Wiltse (of Skiddy, Kansas)\ncontinues as follows : \u2014\"I asked if I was perfectly in possession of my mind,\nso that what I might say should be worthy of being relied upon. Being an\nswered in the decided affirmative, I bade adieu to family and friends, giving\nsuch advice and consolation to each and all as I deemed best, conversed upon\nthe proofs pro and eon. of immortality, and called upon each and all to take\ntestimony for themselves by watching the action of my mind, in the bodily\nstate in which they saw me, and finally, as my pupils fell open, and vision\nbegan to fail, and my voice to weaken, feeling a sense of drowsiness come\nover me, with a strong effort, I straightened my stiffened legs, got my arms\nover the breast, and clasped the fast stiffening Angers, and soon sank into\nutter unconsciousness.\n\"I passed about four hours in all without pulse or perceptible heart-beat,\nas I am informed by Dr. S. H. Raynes, who was the only physician present.\nDuring a portion of this time several of the bystanders thought I was dead,\nand such a report being carried outside, the village church bell was tolled.\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, Jsc. 181\nDr. Raynes informs me, however, that by bringing his eyes close to my face,\nhe could perceive an occasional short gasp, so very light as to be barely per\nceptible, and that he was upon the point, several times, of saying, ' He is.\ndead,' when a gasp would occur in time to check him. [See Dr. Raynes, p. 193.J\n\" He thrust a needle deep into the flesh at different points from the feet\nto the hips, but got no response. Although I was pulseless about four hours,\nthis state of apparent death lasted only about half an hour.\n\" I lost, I believe, all power of thought or knowledge of existence in abso\nlute unconsciousness. Of course, I need not guess at the time so lost, as in\nsuch a state a minute or a thousand years would appear the same. I came\nagain into a state of conscious existence and discovered that I was still in the\nbody, but the body and I had no longer any interests in common. I looked\nin astonishment and joy for the first time upon myself\u2014the me, the real\nEgo, while the not me closed it upon all sides like a sepulchre of clay.\n\"With all the interest of a physician, I beheld the wonders of my bodily\nanatomy, intimately interwoven with which, even tissue for tissue, was 1,\nthe living soul of that dead body. I learned that the epidermis was the out\nside boundary of tlus ultimate tissues, so to speak, of the soul. I realised my\ncondition and reasoned calmly thus. I have died, as men term death, and\nyet I am as much a man as ever. I am about to get out of the body. I\nwatched the interesting process of the separation of soul and body. By some\npower, apparently not my own, the Ego was rocked to and fro, laterally, as.\na cradle is rocked, by which process its connection with the tissues of the\nbody was broken up. After a little time the lateral motion ceased, and\nalong the soles of the feet beginning at the toes, passing rapidly to the heels,\nI felt and heard, as it seemed, the snapping of innumerable small cords.\nWhen this was accomplished I began slowly to retreat from the feet, toward\nthe head, a.s a rubber coitl shortens. I remember reaching the hips and say\ning to myself, ' Now, there is no life below the hips.' I can recall no\nmemory of passing through the abdomen and chest, but recollect distinctly\nwhen my whole self was collected into the head, when I reflected thus : I am\nall in the head now, and I shall soon be free. I passed around the brain as\nif I were hollow, compressing it and its membranes, slightly, on all sides,\ntoward the centre and peeped out between the sutures of the skull, emerg\ning like the flattened edges of a bag of membranes. I recollect distinctly how\nI appeared to myself something like a jelly fish as regards colour and form.\nAs I emerged, I saw two ladies sitting at my head. I measured the distances\nbetween the head of my cot and the knees of the lady opposite the head and\nconcluded there Was room for me to stand, but felt considerable embarrass\nment as I reflected that I was about to emerge naked before her, but com\nforted myself with the thought that in all probability she could not see me\nwith her bodily eyes, as I was a spirit. As I emerged from the head I\nfloated up and down and laterally like a soap-bubble attached to the bowl of a\npipe until I at last broke loose from the body and fell lightly to the floor,\nwhere I slowly rose and expanded into the full stature of a man. I seemed\nto be translucent, of a bluish cast and perfectly naked. With a painful sense\nof embarrassment I fled toward the partially opened door to escape the eyes\nof the two ladies whom I was facing as well as others whom I knew were\nabout me, but upon reaching the door I found myself clothed, and satisficd\n\f182 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nupon that point I turned and faced the company. As I turned, my left\nelbow came in contact with the arm of one of two gentlemen, who were\nstanding in the door. To my surprise, his arm passed through mine without\napparent resistance, the severed parts closing again without pain, as air re\nunites. I looked quickly up at his face to see if he had noticed the contact,\nbut he gave me no sign,\u2014only stood and gazed toward the couch I had just left.\nI directed my gaze in the direction of his, and saw my own dead body. It\nwas lying just as I had taken so much pains to place it, partially upon the\nright side, the feet close together and the hands clasped across the breiist. I\nwas surprised at the paleness of the face. I had not looked in a glass for\nsome days and had imagined that I was not as pale as most very sick people\nare. I congratulated myself upon the decency with which I had composed\nthe body and thought my friends would have little trouble on that score.\n'' I saw a number of persons sitting and standing about the body, and parti\ncularly noticed two women apparently kneeling by my left side, and 1 knew\nthat they were weeping. 1 have since learned that they were my wife and\nmy sister, but I had no conception of individuality. Wife, sister, or friend\nwere as one to me. I did not remember any conditions of relationship ; at\nleast I did not think of any. I could distinguish sex, but nothing further.\n''I now attempted to gain the attention of the people with the object of\ncomforting them as well as assuring them of their own immortality. I bowed\nto them playfully and saluted with my right hand. I passed about among\nthem also, but found that they gave me no heed. Then the situation struck\nme as humorous and I laughed outright.\n\"They certainly must have heard that, 1 thought, but it seemed otherwise,\nfor not one lifted their eyes from my body, It did not once occur to me to\nspeak and I concluded the matter by saying to myself : ' They see only with\nthe eyes of the body. They cannot see spirits. They are watching what\nthey think is I, but they are mistaken. That is not I. This is I and I am\nas much alive as ever.'\n\"I turned and passed out at the open door, inclining my head and watch\ning where 1 set my feet as 1 stepped down on to the porch.\n''I crossed the porch, descended the steps, walked down the path and into\nthe street. There I stopped and looked about me. I never saw that street\nmore distinctly than I saw it then. I took note of the redness of the soil and\nof the washes the rain had made. I took a rather pathetic look about me,\nlike one who is about to leave his home for a long time. Then I discovered\nthat I had become larger than I was in earth life and congratulated myself\nthereupon. I was somewhat smaller in the body than I just liked to be, but\nin the next life, I thought, I am to be as I desired.\n\"My clothes, I noticed, had accommodated themselves to my increased\nstature, and I fell to wondering where they came from and how they got on to\nme so cpjickly and without my knowledge. I examined the fabric and judged\nit to be of some kind of Scotch material, a good suit, I thought, but not hand\nsome ; still, neat and good enough. The coat fits loosely too, and that is\nwell for summer. ' How well I feel,' I thought. ' Ouly a few minutes ago I\nwas horribly sick and distressed. Then came that change, called death, which\nI have so much dreaded. It is past now, and here am I still a man, alive\nand thinking, yes, thinking as clearly as ever, and how well I feel, I shall\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, d-c. 183\nnever be sick again. I have no more to die.' And in sheer exuberance of\nspirits I danced a figure, and fell again to looking at my form and clothes.\n'' Suddenly I discovered that I was looking at the straight seam down the\nback of my coat. How is this, I thought, how do I see my Imck I and I\nlooked again, to reassure myself, down the back of the coat, or down the\nback of my legs to the very heels. I put my hand to my face and felt for my\neyes. They are where they should be, I thought. Am I like an owl that I\ncan turn my head half way round ? I tried the experiment and failed.\n\"No ! Then it must be that having been out of the body, but a few\nmoments, I have yet the power to use the eyes of my body, and I turned\nabout and looked back in at the open door, where I could see the head of my\nbody in a line with me. I discovered then a small cord, like a spider's web,\nrunning from my shoulders back to my body and attaching to it at the base\nof the neck in front.\n\" I was satisfied with the conclusion that by means of that cord, I was\nusing the eyes of my body, and turning, walked down the street.\n\"I had walked but a few steps when I again lost my consciousness, and\nwhen I again awoke found myself in the air, where I was upheld by a pair of\nhands, which I could feel pressing lightly against my sides. The owner of\nthe hands, if they had one, was behind me, and was shoving me through the\nair at a swift but a pleasant rate of speed. By the time I fairly realised\nthe situation 1 was pitched away and floated easily down a few feet, alighting\ngently upon the beginning of a narrow, but well built roadway, inclined\nupward at an angle of something less than 45deg.\n\" I looked up and could see sky and clouds above me at the usual height.\nI looked down and saw the tops of green trees and thought : It is as far\ndown to the tree tops as it is high to the clouds.\n\"As I walked up the road, I seemed to face nearly north. I looked over\nthe right side of the road and under it could see the forest, but discovered\nnaught to support the roadway, yet I felt no fear of its falling. I examined\nthe material of which it was built. It was built of milky quartz and fine\nsand. I picked up one of the gravels and looked at it particularly. I dis\ntinctly remember that it had a dark speck in the centre. I brought it close\nto the eye and so discovered that it was a small hole apparently caused by\nchemical action of some metal. There had been a recent rain, and the cool\nness was refreshing to me. I noticed that, although the grade was steep, I\nfelt no fatigue in walking, but my feet seemed light, and my step buoyant\nas the step of childhood, and as I walked I again reverted to my late con\ndition of illness and rejoiced in my perfect health and strength. Then a\nsense of great loneliness came over me and I greatly desired company, so I\nreasoned thus : Someone dies every minute. If I wait twenty minutes the\nchances are great that someone in the mountains will die, and thus I shall\nhave company. I waited, and while so doing surveyed the scenery about me.\nTo the east was a long line of mountains, and the forest underneath me\n.extended to the mountains, up their sides and out on to the mountain top.\nUnderneath me lay a forest-clad valley, through which ran a beautiful river\nfull of shoals, which cause! the water to ripple in white sprays. I thought\nthe river looked much like the Emerald River, and the mountains, I thought,\nas strongly resembled Waldron's Ridge. On the left of the road was a high\n\f184 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nbluff of black stone, and it reminded me of Lookout Mountain, where the\nrailroad passes between it and the Tennessee River. Thus memory, judg\nment, and imagination, the three great faculties of the mind, were intact and\nactive.\n\"I waited for company, what I judged to be twenty minutes ; but no one\ncame. Then I reasoned thus: It is probable that when a man dies he has his\nindividual road to travel and must travel it alone. As no two men are ex\nactly alike, so, most likely, no two travel the same road into the other world.\nI reflected that as eternal existence was now assured, I had no need to hurry,\nand so walked very leisurely along, now stopping and looking at the scenery,\nor looking back over the road if, perchance, someone might come along, and\noccasionally turning and walking backward, and thus watching the road\n. behind me for company I so strongly desired. I thought certainly some one\nfrom the other world would be out to meet me, though strangely, enough, I\nthought of no person whom above others I desired to see. Angels or fiends,\none, I said, will come out to meet me\u2014I wonder which it will be ? I\nreflected that I had not believed all the Church tenets, but had written and\ntaught verbally a new and, I believed, a better faith. But, I reasoned, I\nknew nothing, and where there is room for doubt there is room for mistake.\nI may, therefore, be on my way to a terrible doom. And here occurred a\nthing hard to describe. At different points about me I was aware of the\nexpressed thought, 'Fear not, you are safe !' I heard no voice, I saw no\nperson, yet I was perfectly aware that at different points, at varying distances\nfrom me, someone was thinking that thought for my benefit, but how I was\nmade aware of it was so great a mystery that it staggered my faith in its\nreality. A great fear and doubt came over me and I was beginning to be\nvery miserable, when a face so full of ineffable love and tenderness appeared\nto me for an instant as set me to rights upon that score.\n\" Suddenly I saw at some distance ahead of me three prodigious rocks\nblocking the road, at which sight I stopped, wondering why so fair a road\nshould be thus blockaded, and while I considered what I was to do, a great\nand dark cloud, which I compared to a cubic acre in size, stood over my head.\nQuickly it became filled with living, moving bolts of fire, which darted hither\nand thither through the cloud. They were not extinguished by contact with\nthe cloud, for I could see them in the cloud as one sees fish in deep water.\n\"The cloud became concave on the under surface like a great tent and\nbegan slowly to revolve upon its perpendicular axis. When it had turned\nthree times, I was aware of a presence, which I could not see, but which I\nknew was entering into the cloud from the southern side. The presence did\nnot seem, to my mind, as a form, because it filled the cloud like some vast\nintelligence. He is not as I, I reasoned : I fill a little space with my form,\nand when I move the space is left void, but he may fill immensity at his will,\neven as he fills this cloud. Then from the right side and from the left of the\ncloud a tongue of black vapour shot forth and rested lightly upon either side\nof my head, and as they touched me thoughts not my own entered into my\nbrain.\n\"These, I said, are his thoughts and not mine ; they might be in Greek or\nHebrew for all power I have over them. But how kindly am I addressed in\nmy mother tongue that so I may understand all his will.\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, iL-c. 185\n\"Yet, although the language was English, it was so eminently above my\npower to reproduce that my rendition of it is as far short of the original as\nany translation of a dead language is weaker than the original ; for instance,\nthe expression, 'This is the road to the eternal world,' did not contain over\nfour words, neither did any sentence in the whole harangue, and every\nsentence, had it been written, must have closed with a period, so complete\nwas the sense. The following is as near as I can render it :\u2014 .\n\" 'This is the road to the eternal world. Yonder rocks are the boundary\nbetween the two worlds and the two lives. Once you pass them, you can no\nmore return into the body. If your work was to write the things that have\nbeen taught you, waiting for mere chance to publish them, if your work was\nto talk to private individuals in the privacy of friendship\u2014if this was all, it\nis done, and you may pass beyond the rocks. If, however, upon considera\ntion you conclude that it shall be to publish as well as to write what you are\ntaught, if it shall be to call together the multitudes and teach them, it is not\ndone and you can return into the body.'\n\"The thoughts ceased and the cloud passed away, moving slowly toward the\nmountain in the east. I turned and watched it for some time when, suddenly,\nand without having felt myself moved, I stood close to and in front of the\nthree rocks. I was seized with a strong curiosity then to look into the next\nworld.\n\"There were four entrances, one very dark, at the left between the\nwall of black rock and the left hand one of the three rocks, a low archway,\nbetween the left hand and the middle rock, and a similar one between that\nand the right hand rock, and a very narrow pathway running around the\nright hand rock at the edge of the roadway.\n\"I did not examine the opening at the left\u2014I know not why, unless it was\nbecause it appeared dark, but I knelt at each of the low archways and looked\nthrough. The atmosphere was green and everything seemed cool and quiet\nand beautiful. Beyond the rocks, the roadway, the valley, and the mountain\nrange curved gently to the left, thus shutting off the view at a short distance.\nIf I were only around there, I thought, I should soon see angels or devils or\nboth, and as I thought this, I saw the forms of both as I had often pictured\nthem in my mind. I looked at them closely and discovered that they were\nnot realities, but the mere shadowy forms in my thoughts, and that any form\nmight be brought up in the same way. What a wonderful world, I exclaimed,\nmentally, where thought is so intensified as to take visible form. How\nhappy shall I be in such a realm of thought as that.\n'' I listened at the archways for any sound of voice or of music, but could\nhear nothing. Solid substances, I thought, are better media of sound than\nair, I will use the rocks as media, and I rose and placed my left ear to first\none rock and then the other throughout, but could hear nothing.\n\" Then suddenly I was tempted to cross the boundary line. I hesitated\nand reasoned thus : ' I have died once and if I go back, soon or late, I must\ndie again. If I stay someone else will do my work, and so the end will be\nas well and as surely accomplished and shall I die again ? I will not, but now\nthat I am so near I will cross the line and stay.' So determining I moved\ncautiously along the rocks. There was danger of falling over the side of the.\no\n\f186 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nroad, for the pathway around was but narrow. I thought not of the archways,\nI placed my back against the rock and walked sideways.\n\u2022* I reached the exact centre of the rock, which I knew by a carved knob in\nthe rock marking the exact boundary. Here, like Ctesar at the Rubicon, I\nhalted and parleyed with conscience. It seemed like taking a good deal of\nresponsibility, but I determined to do it, and advanced the left foot across the\nline. As I did so, a small, densely black cloud appeared in front of me and\nadvanced toward my face. I knew that I was to be stopped. I felt the\npower to move or to think leaving me. My hands fell powerless at my side,\nmy shoulders and head dropped forward, the cloud touched my face and I\nknew no more.\n\" Without previous thought and without apparent effort on my part, my\neyes opened. I looked at my hands and then at the little white cot upon\nwhich I was lying, and realising that I was in the body, in astonishment and\ndisappointment, I exclaimed : What in the world has happened to me ? Must\nI die again ?\n\"I was extremely weak, but strong enough to relate the above experience\ndespite all injunctions to quiet. Soon afterward I was seized with vomiting,\nsevere and uncontrollable. About this time Doctor J. H. Sewel, of Rock-\nwood, Tenn., called upon a friendly visit, not knowing I was sick. I was\nhiccoughing terribly and in consultation he said, ' Nothing short of n\nmiracle, I fear, can save him.'\n\"After many days, it seemed to me, the temperature began to creep up and\nsoon ran above normal, but only a little, wavered back and forth for a few\ndays and settled at a half degree below where it remained during the greater\npart of convalescence, when it mounted to normal, the pulse mounted to\nabove fifty for keeps, as boys say at marbles, then went to seventy-six and I\nmade a rapid and good recovery, for having travelled some hundreds of miles\nduring the interval, as I close this paper my pulse stands at eighty-four and\nis strong, just eight weeks from ' the day I died,' as some of my neighbours\nspeak of it.\n\u2022'There are plenty of witnesses to the truth of the above statements, in so\nfar as my physical condition was concerned. Also to the fact that just as I\ndescribed the conditions about my body and in the room, so they actually\nwere. I must, therefore, have seen these things by some means.\"\nIn a letter to Dr. Hodgson, Dr. Wiltse adds :\u2014\n\"In reply will say that I have delayed answer to this date in order to\ninterview several persons who have followed me from Tennessee to this\nState, and who were eye-witnesses to my physical condition at the time of\nmy strange experience.\n'' I have questioned six of these persons upon the points at issue and find,\naccording to their testimony, the facts to bo as stated in answers to your\nquestions.\n\"The parties named below were present during the phenomena mentioned\nin your letter.

Q. : Were they actually standing in the door 1 A. : They were.\n2. Q. : Was your face as pale as you perceived it to be ? A. : It was\nmuch p:iler as compared with some days before, but one witness states that,\nas compared with only a short time before becoming unconscious, the face\nappeared of a dark purple hue.\n3. Q. : Did you not recognise any person at all among those whom you\nperceived in the room ? A. : I had no thought of names nor ideas of relation\nship. I had a strong sense of good fellowship, if I may so term it, but my\ninterest in each seemed alike. I must have forgotten all personalities.\n4. Q. : Did the washes which you perceived the rain to have made actually\nexist ? A. : They did to a marked degree, there having been heavy rains for\nmany days consecutively.\n5. Q. : Did the fabric in which you seemed to be clothed resemble any\nwhich you had ever worn ? A. : It did not, and I distinctly recollect\nthinking that I had no such clothing in the house, although it did not then\noccur to me that I had never possessed such a suit. I think, however, that\nmy brother who was visiting me had on something such a suit, but cannot bo\ncertain, as I cannot learn that I made any reference to any suit in the room\nas being like it while rehearsing my experience after awaking. If I could see\na suit like it I should recognise it at once.\n6. Q. : Were you previously familiar with the notion that a delicate thread,\nin cases of trance, connects the ethereal organism with the ordinary body i\nA. : Yes, and this will seem to you a c:tse of expectancy. I deem it fair to\nyour Society to state, however, that so far from believing the theory was I\nthat in a volume of fiction upon which I am engaged I had set down an\nentirely different theory as emanating from one of the characters who is made\nto teach my own private views strongly enough. When I discovered the\nthread my mind did not go back to any previous recollections or ideas upon\nthe subject, as I should suppose would naturally be the case.\nDr. Wiltse adds, June 30th, 1890 :\u2014\n\"In accordance with your request in letter of June 18th for evidential\nstatements I have obtained three sworn statements, which I send herewith.\"\nif\nStatement of Mrs. Haidee I, Wiltse.\nSkiddy, Kas., Jane 27t%, 1890.\nMr. Richard Hodgson.\nSir,\u2014I was present at the bedside of my husband during that time in\nhis sickness last summer that his physician and friends supposed him to be\ndying, some even believing he was dead.\nHis condition of unconsciousness lasted, I suppose, about half an hour,\nduring which I could see no sign of life in him. Still, I did not really believe\nhim to be dead, nor did I give up all hope of his recovery, for reasons stated.\n0 2\n\f188 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfurther on in this letter. This notwithstanding the fact that the physician\nin attendance told me that he was certainly dying.\nAfter remainingdike on\u00ab dead to appearance (from where I was) for some\ntime, he suddenly opened his eyes and said, \" Must I die again ?\"\nI told him he had not died yet. But he said ho had died, and began to\ntell what he had seen, when his physician made him stop talking. He per\nsisted for a little, but finally yielded, said ho would tell us all after a while\nwhy he had come back, saying he had seen something wonderful, and should\nnever doubt of immortality again.\nAs to the other matters, I do not recollect.\nThe reason I did not believe he was going to die was this : I have several\ntimes in my life dreamed of seeing a white horse and a black horse harnessed\nin a carriage and running through the air over an open field and disap\npearing in a forest on the opposite side. Some friend of mine sits in the\ncarriage and is recognised by me, who invariably dies a few days afterwards.\nA few days before the doctor was taken sick I saw him in that carriage.\nBut the dream varied in this, that I ran and caught the white horse by tho bits,\njust before they got into the wood, and so stopped them. So strangely had\nI come to believe in this dream, that I kept believing in it clear through. I\ntold the dream to the doctor the next morning after I dreamed it, and he\nlaughed at me. \u2014Very respectfully,\nMrs. Haidee Wiltse.\nMorris County, State of Kansas, S.S.\nMrs. Haidee Wiltse, being duly sworn, deposes and says that she is well\nacquainted with all the facts stated in the above, and that she signed the\nabove with her free will and accord.\nSubscribed and sworn to before me, a Notary Public in and for Morris\nCounty, State of Kansas, this 30th day of June, a.d. 1890.\nH.

Howard.\nSkiddy, Kas., June 29th, 1890.\nMr. Richard Hodgson.\nSir,\u2014I was chosen by Dr. Wiltse, during his sickness last summer, as\nthe one who could turn and lift him easiest, which arrangement kept me by\nhis bedside a large share of the time.\nOne day (I forget the date) he seemed much worse, so that the family\nand neighbours thought he was dying.\nI took Dr. S. H. Raynes, the only attending physician present, out into\nthe porch, and asked him to tell me confidentially what he thought of the\ncase. He said, \" A gone case ; he is as good as dead now.\" He was fixing\na hypodermic syringe, and I asked about it, and he said he was making\nready to give the doctor an injection of morphine, in case he should have\nspasms while dying. This was not done, however.\nDoctor Wiltse called to him just then, and said, \" Doctor, as soon as I\nam dead try that experiment, and be sure you don't put it off so late that\nyou have no chance of a positive result. It is worth looking into.\" Ho\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, d-c. 189\nspoke of this several times, and exacted a promise from some of us that it\nshould be tried. It was, I have since learned, to inject ether to see if he\nwould speak, and what he would say.\nHe told us to leave room in front of the window, that he might have\nlight, and that if he should see anything that would prove immortality he\nwould tell us, if he had strength even to whisper, and would tell us the\ntruth. He afterwards spoke of a light, but after being silent for some time\nsaid he understood tho philosophy of the light, that it was a natural occur\nrence, and explained it to us. He had spells of quiet, like he was going\ndown, but would rouse out of them and talk. He called to one of the\nneighbours, who was sitting at his right foot rubbing it, and said, '' Look\nnow, Mr. Fordham, we have talked a good deal about immortality. I see\nyou rubbing my foot, but I have only sight to tell me. I cannot feel you ;\nmy body is about dead. But did you ever see my mind clearer ? It is not\ndying yet.\" Mr. Fordham said, \"I never saw anything like it.\" Dr.\nWiltse said, \" This is my last argument. Do you begin to be convinced?\"\nSoon after this he closed his eyes, and seemed to become entirely uncon\nscious. I did not think him entirely dead, although many did. After about\nhalf an hour he suddenly opened his eyes and looked about as if greatly\nsurprised, and said, \"Do I have to die again ?\" He then told us not to be\nscared any more, for he should get well ; that his work was not finished, and\nhe was to live until it was. He said he had been to the other world, and\nbegan to tell of things he had seen, and said we were immortal. Dr. Raynes\nmade him stop talking several times ; but ho would soon begin again, and so\nin a short time he had told by piecemeal that same story which has since\nbeen printed, and which he has read to me before it was printed and since,\nto see if it was stated as I remembered it. I came to Kansas along with\nhim, and so saw the story before it was printed, and it is just as he first\ntold, so far as the incidents are concerned, and he must have thought it\nup mighty quick if it is not true.\nI distinctly remember that while he was sleeping, Mrs. Wiltse and the\ndoctor's sister\u2014Miss Sara E. Wiltse\u2014were sitting at his left side. There\nwere also some women at his head. There were also some men in the door\n\u2014I think Mr. H. M. Wiltse, the doctor's brother, and Dr. Raynes.\nThe washes in the street during the doctor's sickness were considerably\ndeepened and widened, as the street in front of his house has a heavy\ngrade. I am sure it showed a good deal of difference from the last time he\nsaw it before that to the day he so nearly died, as it rained a great deal in\nthe time.\nA. J.

S. Miller, Notary Public,\nCom. Ex., March 21st, 1892.\n\f190 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nWilliam T. Howard.\nSkiddy, Morris Co., Kas., June 28<\/i, 1890.\nMr. Richard Hodgson, Boston.\nSir,\u2014I was with Dr. A. S. Wiltse and helped to nurse him for many\ndays while sick in Tennessee about a year ago. I was present on that\nday when his friends and his physician supposed he was dying. He\nwas several hours without pulse that I could discover, and the physician,\nDr. S. H. Raynes, reported the same also. I asked Dr. Raynes privately\nabout his chances for life, and was told that it was utterly impossible for him\nto recover, as he was already dying. I was greatly agitated at this intelligence\nuntil Dr. Wiltse asked his friends to be very quiet and attentive that so they\nmight watch very closely for any sign he might be able to give which\nmight be proof to them of immortality as a fact instead of a mere hope or\nbelief. He asked if the physician was well satisfied that his mind was clear,\nso that what he might say should be entirely worthy of belief. Dr. Raynes\ntold him it was as clear as any well man's. Dr. Wiltse said he felt that it\nwas, and I must say that I never saw anyone exhibit greater clearness of\nintellect.\nDr. Wiltse then said that we should stand close by him, as his voice was\nweak, so that we could hear even a whisper, and that if he saw anything that\nwas a proof he would tell us, and that what he might tell us we could rely\nupon.\nThe pupils of his eyes fell open and so his sight began to fail so that he\ncomplained of it, when he said he saw a light at the end of the room in\nthe window, but soon after said he had discovered what it was, and ex\nplained it upon some scientific plan which I do not recollect, but which\nseemed reasonable.\nI became so interested in his talk that I no longer felt excited, and went\nand stood by his head that I might hear any words he might speak. I think\nall in the room must have felt the same, for I noticed that most of them\nstopped crying, and crowded about him as if they wished and expected to\nhear something curious and interesting.\nHis eyes finally closed, and he lay for some time like one dead. I don't\nknow how long, when he suddenly opened his eyes and, as if greatly surprised,\nsaid vehemently, ' ' What in the world has happened ? Is it possible that I\nhave to die again ? \"\nHe then began to tell us of things he had seen, but the attending\nphysician interfered and said he must not talk. Dr. Wiltse then said he\nwould tell us all about it before long, and soon after told the same story\nsubstantially as he has since published.\nAs to matters seen by him about the room, &c, I distinctly recollect that\nthe door was standing partly open and that two men stood in it a portion of\nthe time, although I do not feel certain who they were. It rained a good deal\nwhile he was sick, but did not rain on this particular day, but was a bright\nday. I have no doubt that the washes in the street had changed a good deal\nfrom what they had been when he last saw them with his natural eyes. I\nrecollect also that there were some women sitting at his head, although I am\nnot certain how many. I heard him relate his strange experience the first\ntime soon after ho awoke, and have heard him relate it probably to a score or\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 101\nmore of people since and twice to audiences, and have purposely watched tot\nany contradictory statements which might throw doubt upon its entire truth\nfulness. Have also read his published statement, but in all he has never\ncrossed his statements. His experience has evidently made a strong impres\nsion upon him, for I have never heard him express any doubts as to immor\ntality since, although before that he had often expressed fear and doubt upon\nthe subject.'\u2014Yours truly,\nW. T. Howard.\nState of Kansas, Morris County, S.S.\nWilliam T. Howard, being duly sworn, says the above is true in all the\nmatters there stated.\nW. T. Howard.\nSubscribed and sworn to before me, a Notary Public in and for Morris\nCounty, State of Kansas.\nH. S. Miujer, Notary Public,\nCom. Ex., March 21st, 1892.\nMiss Sara E. Wiltse, Corunna, Mich.\nCorunna, Michigan, Jidy 10th, 1890.\nMr. Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014I cannot make this statement as brief as I would like because\nthe value of it depends upon some of the details.\nDr. A. S. Wiltse is my brother, and had I supposed his illness other than\na fatal one, I should certainly have made notes upon his condition from day\nto day. I think his record in the St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal\nremarkably clear and exact, even as to our positions beside what we supposed\nto be his dying bed. Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter read that report with me on\nits first appearance, and found it in harmony with what we knew or could\nrecall of the circumstances, except that I thought my brother was mistaken\nabout my position beside his cot, but both Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter assure me\nthat my memory and not that of my brother is at fault in that particular.\nMrs. Carpenter is in ill-health and I would not like her to review this painful\nsubject at present, otherwise she would respond to your request for a\nstatement.\nWhen my brother, Hon. H. M. Wiltse, and Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter\ncame in response to my telegram, we agreed there should be no moment of\nwhat we supposed would be the brief remainder of Dr. Wiltse's life, when he\ncould not see or touch either his brother, his sister, or his niece, the only\nones present who were part of the old home circle. We also resolved that, at\nwhatever cost to us, he should be troubled by no tears or sorrowful tones.\nDr. Wiltse has, and has always had, very strong tendencies to beliefs in the\nsupernatural, and has been a ghost hunter, visiting \"haunted\" houses and\ninquiring into all popular superstitions that he could find about him. His\nbrother, Henry M. Wiltse, is a lawyer, with little patience with such\nspeculations. I am a teacher, believing strongly in the immortality of the\nsoul, but not in ghostly visitors, though all phenomena of this nature were\na favourite topic between Dr. Wiltse and myself. I claimed that a person\nwho saw spirits was in an abnormal condition, and needed medical treat\nment, assuring him whenever I should see one I would send for him if he\n\f192 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\u2022would bring his lancet and powders. Mr. Carpenter, also a teacher, is\nsomething of a modern Theosophist, and Mrs. Carpenter is a music teacher\nof decidedly practical turn of mind, believing in the possibility of seeing a\ndisembodied spirit, but never dwelling upon the subject, being rather reticent\nabout the most serious matters. Such were our mental attitudes when wo\ngathered for what we supposed our last earthly meeting. The physicians in\nattendance I never met until that week, and I do not now know what their\nbeliefs are.\nMy brother longed for some Heavenly vision. I think he was profoundly\ndisappointed because he saw no angels and heard no seraphs, for previous to\nhis unconsciousness he expressed surprise that he should be so near the other\nlife and get no impression of it through his bodily senses. I remember per\nfectly his attention to his failing sight, his measurement of the decreasing\nlength of vision, and his report of the growing dimness while his voice was yet\ntolerably clear. He often appealed to us to know if wo still believed in tho\nlife eternal even in that presence, and it seemed to increase his hopefulness\nthat we believed without aid of unaccountable sights or sounds, and while\nlonging for some remarkable revelation, he yet rejoiced in his mental vigour,\nand occasionally asked the doctor in attendance if he seemed to him to be\nwandering in the least, for he should be sorry not to be in full possession of\nhis mental faculties when body and spirit separated.\nI remember perfectly the attempt he made to straighten his stiffening\nlimbs, for, although he could not speak, he smiled his thanks for tho service\nI rendered by helping him in that last physical effort. I thought he could\nfeel my touch, and believed he saw my face, and so I would not give way to\ntears. It was not until we were sure that all his bodily senses had failed that I\nallowed myself to cry; therefore his singularly well remembered train of\nthought about his soul, and his observance of his weeping wife and sister, must\nhave occurred while he was apparently unconscious, and after the doctor had\npronounced life extinct.\nThat it was not an ordinary or even extraordinary delusion of a fevered\nbrain seems proven by his continued clearness of mind ; there was none of the\nusual delirium of fever at any time during his illness, even during those days\nthat are a blank in his memory. I think he was perfectly cognisant of the\npresent moment, its symptoms and his attendants, during all of the time that\nhe was conscious, but he could not remember from hour to hour what\nmedicines had been administered. He prescribed for himself with admirable\nskill, but had to ask the other doctors if that remedy had already been tried,\nand was as professionally courteous to them as if he had been in consultation\nover some other patient. I remember his telling them that he did not forget\nthat he was the sick man, and would not oppose the opinion of the patient\nto that of the doctors, and showed none of the bravado which a delirious\ndoctor might have felt. I sat up with him many nights in succession, a\nphysician sleeping in his office, and when there was any alarming change in\nhis condition he would tell mo what to give instantly\u2014if there seemed no\ntime to lose in calling for aid, always insisting afterwards that I should speak\nto the doctor to make sure the remedy was approved by a physician in\nhealth. These alarming conditions came on very suddenly, and wero\nextremely dangerous, but Dr. Wiltse's coolness and good judgment wero\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 193\ninvariably commended by the other doctors ; his failure of memory finally\ninterfered with the safety of his own advice, but his judgment even then was\nperfectly sound, and there was no muddling of symptoms or treatment.\nThe fever was of a very uncommon type, and one of the attending\nphysicians had a book with descriptions of a like case. Dr. Wiltse wanted it\nto read, but the other doctor pretended he forgot to bring it, telling me there\nwere points that my brother should not read up under the circumstances,\nand my brother felt hurt that a doctor could forget at such a time. Happily\nhe himself forgot the book before many hours. All these recollections are to\nshow my brother's mental and physical condition as I observed it in that\nillness.\nI have had typhoid fever myself, and have seen several cases of it, having\nbeen with a cousin several days previous to and during all of his dying hours.\nI have seen several people die of various diseases, and am sadly familiar\nwith the symptoms of approaching death. I had no hope whatever of my\nbrother's recovery after the convulsions set in, although I joined in every\neffort made to prolong his life.\nHis sinking and all the preceding symptoms were so like death that I\nalways think of the occasion as \"when he died,\" and have to think twice\nbefore I can speak with precision of the time when he seemed to die.\nIt seems to mo that the psychological value of this phenomenon lies in the\nprobable activity of the mind during apparent unconsciousness, and not in\nany guesses that may be hazarded about relations of life and death which\nmight be based upon it, although one must reverence the opinion of any who\nthink as some of the good mountain people do, that Dr. Wiltse actually died\nand came to life again.\u2014Very respectfully yours,\nSara E. Wiltse.\nFinally, we have now obtained the account of the doctor in attendance,\nas follows :\u2014\nKismet, Morgan Co., Tennessee, March 31st, 1892.\n'Mr. R. Hodgson, LL.D.\nDear Sir,\u2014I was the attending physician present when Dr. A. S. Wiltse\nlay apparently dead in August, 1889. I observed his symptoms closely, and\nif there are any symptoms marking a patient as in articvlo mortis that were\nnot presented in his case, I am ignorant of them. I supposed at one time that\nhe was actually dead as fully as I ever supposed anyone dead. I thrust a\nneedle deep into the flesh at different points, and got no sign of sensibility.\nThere was no pulse and no perceptible heart-sounds. The breath was, so\nfar as observable, absolutely suspended.\nS. H. Raynes, M.D.\nSome readers, perhaps, may smile at this highly modernised\nparallel to the death scene of the Phaido. But surely Socrates would\nhimself have been the first to approve Dr. Wiltse's resolute attempt to\nsubstitute knowledge for opinion in this weightiest of all crises. Nor\nneed we find anything irreverent in this absorption in experiment in\nthe face of advancing Death. Death's \" truer name,\" the Laureate has\nsaid, \" is Onward\"; and for an agnostic, at least, no attitude in the\n\f194 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nlast earthly hour can be more manful than the desire that his own\nparting experience should leave light and hope for other men.\nHere, at any rate, whatever view we take as to the source or the\ncontent of Dr. Wiltse's vision, the fact remains that the patient,\nwhile in a comatose state, almost pulseless, and at a temperature much\nbelow the normal, did, nevertheless, undergo a remarkably vivid series\nof mental impressions. It is plain, therefore, that we may err in\nother cases by assuming prematurely that all power of perception or\ninference has ceased.\nSetting aside the manifestly dream-like or symbolical element of the\nvision, we observe that Dr. Wiltse believes that his perception of the\npeople in the room, and of the rain-washed streets outside, was of a\nclairvoyant type. But this cannot be proved ; for the picture of the\nstreets might be due to unconscious inference ; and some acuteness of\nperception, like that of the lethargic hypnotised subject, might account\nfor his knowledge of movements in the room made after his eyes were\nclosed. However this may be, it is probable that if he had actually\ndied, and if some kind of message from him had been subsequently\nreceived, that message might have included facts as to the scene of\ndeath which the survivors would have believed to have been unknown\nto him while still living, but which he did in fact acquire during his\ncomatose condition. \u2022\nG. 207.\nThe following narrative, while lacking both the precision and the corrobo\nration of Dr. Wiltse's record, indicates a more marked clairvoyance,\u2014exer\ncised, singularly enough, under very similar conditions of deathly cold.\nThe Rev. L. J. Bertrand (Huguenot minister) gave Dr. Hodgson an oral\naccount of this experience, and has now sent it in writing to Professor W.\nJames. The case is very remote ; but although the details cannot be trusted\nat this distance of time, the main fact of the clairvoyance in extremis, and\nof the practical joke played on the guide, can hardly have crept unawares\ninto the story. M. Bertrand's memory of Switzerland, I may add, seems\npretty clear.\nNeuilly, Seine, 14 Bis, Rue Borghese, October 10th, 1891.\nDear Dr. James,\u2014Excuse me, but since your last kind letter, illness and\ndeath have come in my family ; then I have been obliged to visit Belgium,\nthen to help my societies, &c , &c. I have had no time for answers.\nMany people remembering my accident on the Titlis answer me, but\nthey exaggerate everything ; others have only a vague notion, and because I\nam alive, I am surprised to find how many have died during the last 30\nyears ; how many have disappeared from their place. My friends' letters\nand mine will, however, sooner or later, unite the past and the present. If\nI had been able to visit Switzerland ! But death has come, and our plans\narc forwarded to next year. I have written and written to India\u2014but no\nanswer has yet arrived.\nMeanwhile, I send you the relation of the fact, avoiding for this time\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 195\neverything which ought to be told by others, and which happened after the\nawakening or resurrection. I must write, currente calamo, and in my poor\nEnglish ; my time is absorbed by too many things. I authorise you to use\nmy notes as you pleaso, provided you correct them, and that you do not alter\nin the slightest way what I affirm.\u2014Most respectfully yours,\nL. J. Bertrand.\nDear Dr. James,\u2014For 27 consecutive years, during the two best\nmonths, I climbed with two, three, or four pupils the peaks of the Alps\nand Pyrenees ; of course we had, now and then, disagreeable adventures.\nOnce, a young English officer, Hatton Turner, and I were lost in the snow\nnear the Vignemale for 40 hours. I read in a paper the full description\nof our own death : it seems that we were murdered by Spanish brigands !\nLater, my father and my wife became fully convinced that once or another I\nwould fall into a crevice or a precipice, or be shot in the dark by a bandit.\nTo calm their perpetual alarm, I resolved to hide from them all my little\naccidents, and to write no journal. Now, I deeply regret my taking such a\nresolution\u2014too late.\nSome 30 years ago, after crossing from the Rhone valley, I sent my\nyoung men to Meyringen, and I went to Interlaken to prove to my wife that\nthough she had heard of my falling into a deep crevice of a glacier, I was\nstill fully alive. On my return I missed the coach, and instead of meeting\nmy young men at the foot of the Yoch Pass at 9 a.m., as agreed, I\nreached them at the inn Engstlenalp\u2014foot of the Titlis, 45 minutes from the\nCol of the Yoch\u2014only at 1 p.m.\nWhilst taking my meal on the grass, surrounded by my companions, I\nsaid to a guide : \" Why do you not climb that beautiful Titlis straight up\nfrom this side instead of going round to meet the long, zigzagging Triibsee\nAlp way 1 You make such a fuss for an easy climbing of 10,000 feet ! \"\n\" Because this side is generally hard, sometimes dangerous, and this year\nimpossible.\"\nOne of my young men replied, laughingly : \"I suppose that you never\ntried ; if tourists did not first guide the guide, no guide would guide the\ntourist.\"\nThen came another older guide, called, I think, Karl Infanger, who told\nme : \" Lately I went there hunting, and I assure you that this year, because\nof the snow and of an onormous bump of the glacier, it would be perfect\nmadness to risk it.\"\n\" Well, we may try, and I will give you double pay, when even we\nshould be obliged to come back unsuccessful.\"\n\" When do you mean to leave ? \"\n\" As soon as you are ready, because I hope to see from the top the sun\nset instead of the sunrise. Take only a rope ; we have pikes and hooks\nenough.\"\n\" We will then make two follies instead of one, for the snow is melting\nand slippery.\"\nHe was right in calling my obstinacy \" perfect madness,\" for when we at\nlast reached the top of the steep and dangerous part we all felt surprised that\nwe had not fallen from a precipice and smashed our bodies against a rock.\nAnd then my legs complained pitifully that they had walked from six in the\n\f196 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nmorning till five in the afternoon, and had made strenuous, tremendous efforts\nfor the last two hours.\nI therefore said to my companions : \"I have been many times on the\nsummit, and know that you no longer want my prudent (!) direction. As I am\nvery tired, I will remain here, if you promise me to follow my orders. You,\nguide, do you promise me, when you climb the peak, to go up by the left and\ncome down by the right 1 \"\n\" Of course ; we always do so. I promise.\"\nThen I explained to my young men that the peak is like one half of a\nsugar-loaf, cut from top to bottom, and that on the left there was a dangerous\ncut, which they might not see in coming down. I therefore placed the\nstrongest of my pupils at the end of the rope, and said : \" Do you promise me\nto remain there the last ? \"\n\"I promise.\"\n\" Very well, go.\"\nI sat down, my legs hanging on a dangerous slope or precipice, my back\nleaning on a rock as big as an armchair. I chose that brink because there\nwas no snow, and because I could face better the magnificent panorama of the\nAlpes Bernoises. I at once remembered that in my pocket were two cigars,\nand put one between my teeth, lighted a match, and considered myself as the\nhappiest of men. Suddenly I felt as thunderstruck by apoplexy, and though\nthe match burned my fingers, I could not throw it down. My head was per\nfectly clear and healthy, but my body was as powerless and motionless as a\nrock. There was for me no hesitation. \"This,\" I thought, \" is the sleep of\nthe snows! If I move I shall roll down in the abyss; if I do not move I\nshall be a dead man in 25 or 30 minutes.\" A kind of prayer was sent\nto God, and then I resolved to study quietly the progress of death. My feet\nand hands were first frozen, and little by little death reached my knees and\nelbows. The sensation was not painful, and my mind felt quite easy. But\nwhen death had been all over my body my head became unbearably cold, and\nit seemed to mo that concave pincers squeezed my heart, so as to extract my\nlife. I never felt such an acute jmn, but it lasted only a second or a minute,\nand my life went out. \" Well,\" thought I, \"at last I am what they call a\ndead man, and here I am, a ball of air in the air, a captive balloon still\nattached to earth by a kind of elastic string and going up and always up. How\nstrange ! I see better than ever, and I am dead\u2014only a small space in the\nspace without a body ! . . . Where is my last body t \" Looking down, I\nwas astounded to recognise my own envelope. \" Strange ! \" said I to myself.\n\"There is the corpse in which I lived and which I called me, as if tho coat\nwere the body, as if the body were the soul ! What a horrid thing is that\nbody !\u2014deadly pale, with a yellowish-blue colour, holding a cigar in its mouth\nand a match in its two burned fingers ! Well, I hope that you shall never\nsmoke again, dirty rag ! Ah ! if only I had a hand and scissors to cut the\nthread which ties me still to it ! When my companions return they will look\nat that and exclaim, 'The Professor is dead.' Poor young friends! They\ndo not know that I never was as alive as I am, and the proof is that I see the\nguide going up rather by the right, when he promised me to go by the left ;\nW. was to be the last, and he is neither the first nor the last, but alone, away\nfrom the rope. Now the guide thinks that I do not see him because he hides\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, ifcc. 197\nhimself behind the young men whilst drinking at my bottle of Madeira.\nWell, go on, poor man, I hope that my body will never drink of it again.\nAh ! there he is stealing a leg of my chicken. Go on, old fellow, eat the\nwhole of the chicken if you choose, for I hope that my miserable corpse will\nnever eat or drink again.\" I felt neither surprise nor vexation ; I simply\nstated facts with indifference. \" Hallo ! \" said I, \" there is my wife going to\nLucerne, and she told me that she would not leave before to-morrow, or after\nto-morrow. They are five before the hotel of Lungern. Well, wife, I am a\ndead man. Good-bye.\"\nI must confess that I did not call dear the one who has always been very\ndear to me, and that I felt neither regret nor joy at leaving her. My only\nregret was that I could not cut the string. In vain I travelled through so\nbeautiful worlds that earth became insignificant. I had only two wishes : the\ncertitude of not returning to earth and the discovery of my next glorious\nbody, without which I felt powerless. I could not be happy because the 1\nthread, though thinner than ever, was not cut, and the wished-for body was\nstill invisible to my searching looks.\nSuddenly a shock stopped my ascension, and I felt that somebody was\npulling and pulling the balloon down. My grief was measureless. The fact\nwas that whilst my young friends threw snowballs at each other our guide\nhad discovered and administered to my body the well-known remedy, rubbing\nwith snow ; but as I was cold and stiff as ice, he dared not roll me for fear of\nbreaking my hands still near the cigar. I could neither see nor hear any\nmore, but I could measure my way down, and when I readied my body again\nI had a last hope\u2014the balloon seemed much too big for the mouth. Suddenly\nI uttered the awful roar of a wild beast\u2014the corpse swallowed the balloon,\nand Bertrand was Bertrand again, though for a time worse than before.\nHere is for me an obscurity. I remember only that all seemed to me\nconfusion and chaos, and I felt disdain for the guide who, expecting a good\nreward, tried to make me understand that he had done wonders, and for my\npupils, who repeatedly approved his tiresome sayings. What I know, too, is\nthat for a time they unmercifully shook and dragged my sore body as if I had\nbeen a drunkard. I never felt a more violent irritation. At last I could say\nto my poor guide, \" Because you are a fool you take me for a fool, whilst my\nbody alone is sick. Ah ! if you had simply cut the string.\"\n\" The string ? What string ? You were nearly dead.\"\n\"Dead ! I was less dead than you are now, and the proof is that I saw you\ngoing up the Titlis by the right, whilst you promised me to go by the left.\"\nThe man staggered before replying, \" Because the snow was soft and that\nthere was no danger of slipping.\"\n\" You say that because you thought me far away. You went up by the\nright and allowed two young men to put aside the rope. Who is a fool ? You\n\u2014 not I. Now show me my bottle of Madeira, and we will see if it is full.\"\nThe blow was such that his hands left my body and he fell down, saying,\nevidently to himself, \"Did he follow us? No, we should have seen him.\nCould he see through the mountain ? Is his body dead, and does his ghost\nreproach me for what I did ? \"\n\" Oh,\" said I, brutally, \"you may fall down and stare at me as much as\n\f198 Mr. F, W. H. Myers.\nyou please, and give your poor explanations, but you cannot prove that my\nchicken has two legs, because you stole one.\"\nThis was too much for the good man. He got up, emptied his knapsack\nwhilst muttering a kind of confession, and then flew away. I never saw him\nafter, but I heard that at an inn he was as delirious as myself, and spoke\nsomewhat like this :\u2014\n\"You believe that captain is a man. [Some guides in the Oberland and\nat Zermatt called me sometimes captain because I often had with me young\ncadets.] But now I know him. This year I never would have gone straight\nup this side of the Titlis. Sure of unsuccess, I went, and we succeeded\nwithout any serious trouble. This was already astonishing. At i ha\npretended to be tired and stopped there. When we returned he apparently\nwas as dead as death itself from apoplexy, or the sleep of the snows, and\na cigar in his mouth. However, I rubbed and rubbed him, and to my amaze-\n\u2022 ment he came to life again to reproach me for all I had done. He had been\nin two places, seen his companions leaving the rope, seen me taking a leg of\nour chicken and some of our wine. Captain is not a man ; my bebef is that\nI never saw the devil before yesterday and that I saw him all this half day.\"\n\"Did he pay you what he promised 1 \"\n\" Surely not. I would not receive a centime from the devil.\" [This is\ntrue ; I have not yet paid.]\nWe, of course, arrived late at night at Triibsee Alp, and in the morning my\nlegs and arms were so stiff that to walk the five miles between Trcibsee and\nEngelberg, I took nearly the whole day. How often did I regret that the\nguide had not cut the string ' My young men tried over and over again to\ncalm my irritation by assuring me that the violation of their promises was\njustifiable because of the softness of the snow. I simply asked them not to\nsay a word to my wife, who for them was to be next day\u2014and for me was\nalready\u2014in Lucerne.\nWhen I arrived there, I asked her why she had left Interlaken sooner\nthan she had told me.\n\" Because I was afraid of another accident, and wanted to be nearer.\"\n\"Were you five in the carriage, and did you stop at the Lungern\nHotel?\"\n' ' Yes ; who told you all that ? Have you a spy for me ? \"\n\" Surely not.\" And I went away laughing, to write a letter to Karl, who\ndid not answer.\nThree days after, being at Pitzker boarding-house, I gave my young\nfriends, as a token of my gratitude (:), a Uttle banquet at the Englisher Hof,\nto which, of course, were invited my wife and her friend, Miss Hope, of\nManchester. There a young man advised secretly Miss H. to ask my wife\nhow I knew of their disobedience ? My wife looked so surprised and\ndispleased that I avoided the answer by a furious attack on chatterboxes,\nand the subject was dropped.\nAnother fact tormented me. I had plainly seen, from on high, places\nwhere I had never been, and, of course, I much wanted to visit them, and\nverify whether my vision was exact. One was the route from Meyringen to*\ni I cannot remember the name of the spot, which is at the extreme right of tha\nEotheck.\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 199\nWasen by the Justen. I found Inter that I had a perfect topography of\nit, and I must confess that if I kept all those facts secretly in my heart, they\nhad a real, decisive influence on my life. If I have been brought to religion,\nit is not through a pastor or even my Bible, but by a good many like or\ndifferent facts which I might relate, but which I cannot explain.\nIn 1883 I was with my colleague, Reveilland, and Pastors Elgin and\nKrieger on the summit of Santa Cruz, Algeria, when our conversation led us\nto \"the separation of the soul from the body.\" I deplored to see medical\ndoctors making a confusion between the soul and the life of a man, and\nbecause I thought myself far enough from my wife, I related publicly for the\nfirst time my story of the Titlis. To my horror, my friend Elgin asked\nme an abbreviation of it, which he corrected or not, but published in one of\nhis books !\nWhen in Boston, as fantastic argument against materialism, I quoted it\nagain before Doctors Twombly, Griffis, Calkins, Thomas, McKenzie, &c. I\nalways thought that I alone could understand its meaning, and I used it as\nto say, \"Do you know what is behind the curtain? I am afraid of occult\nsciences, but . . .\"\nThen came Dr. James, saying: \"Hallo! This concerns a scientific\nquestion. Write for me your adventure, as you remember it, and, if\npossible, find witnesses.\" Scientific question ! Witnesses !\nOf course, now I regret not to have kept a journal, for 20 years have\nelapsed. When I wrote about my guide the answer was : \" Your Karl\nfell from the Titlis over the precipice.\" When I wrote\u2014from Boston\u2014to\nmy dearest friend, Professor Jules Dubourg, to whom I had said and written\neverything, his son Rov. J. A. Dubourg replied : \" My father died lately,\nand we have not found your paper.\" When I wrote to one of my pupils,\nhis friends answered : \" His name is not on the list because he was killed in\nthe colonies.\" Another \" left the place years ago, but I hope to find his new\naddress.\" A fifth \"is probably in India, but I have not yet an answer.\" I\nbegged of a friend to say to some Swiss guides and chaletiers : \"If you can\nfind what Karl Infanger said of a tourist called Captain, his real name being\nBertrand, who often climbed the Titlis, you may expect a reward.\" I\nreceived two letters only. One is a ridiculous account of my resurrection by\nmagic at Engelberg or Triibsce Alp. The other remembers only having\nheard that a ghost or devil had a duel with a French officer on the Titlis,\nbut could not throw him down as he did throw Karl Infanger\u2014mere trash of\npeople who heard evidently of my accident, laughed at Karl's sayings, and\nwho have now forgotten everything, but would like the reward. My wife\nremembers well the dinner at the Englisher Hof and why I gave it, but as\nshe knew little, she answers vaguely about the details, even about Lungern\nand her travelling companions, whom she thinks were Russians and English.\nMiss Hope writes that the fact made upon her a deep impression, but as she\nwas quite a young lady, the deepest impression was that my young men took\na long, long time to come from the Titlis to Lucerne.\nMy children heard\u2014never from me\u2014for twenty years, and from different\nsides of my adventure, but cannot now give me names.\nThere I am, but I still persist in thinking that I will find some missing\nlinks allowing me to complete my story. All the friends I have questioned\n\f200 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nremember facts, grosso modo, only because I refused to speak ; some disagree\nwith me on names and dates, and they puzzled my poor memory for the\npresent. L. J. B.\nIt is pretty certain, I repeat, that this narrative, written so long\nafter the event, must contain errors of detail. But if we accept the\nwriter's good faith\u2014which there is no reason to doubt\u2014it is probable\nthat there must have been an amount of knowledge supernonnally\nacquired before actual death which, if reproduced in some post\nmortem communication, would have seemed to prove a continued power\nof terrene observation,\u2014although in fact that power, for aught we can\ntell, might have abruptly ceased so soon as the \" thread \" was finally\nsevered.\nHere, then, is one possible source of mistaken ascription of post\nmortem knowledge to the dead. Nor is the decedent's own clair\nvoyance ire extremis the only clairvoyance which may bo thus mis\ninterpreted. There may be telepathic clairvoyance on the percipient's\npart. Various cases quoted or referred to by Mrs. Sidgwick (Pro\nceedings, Vols. VI. and VII.), or published in Phantasms of the Living\n(see Clairvoyance in Index), indicate that the shock of the message\nfrom the dying friend may in soma way enable the percipient to\ndiscern, not only his personality, but his actual surroundings at the\nmoment.1\nLet us pass a little beyond the dying scene, and come to cases\nwhere the decedent shows a knowledge of his own appearance or\ndress in the coffin. A striking ease of this kind was given in\nVol. VI., p. 17, and Dr. Hodgson has since interviewed the informant,\nwith the result of an increased confidence in his accuracy.2 Dr.\nHodgson has since sent us two cases where a similar knowledge on the\ndecedent's part appears to be shown.\nG. 208.\nThe Herald, Dubuque, Iowa,\nFebruary 11th, 1891.\nA most remarkable incident has just come to light, and while it cannot be\ns;,id that the truth of Spiritualism is thereby demonstrated, it furnishes a\ndeeply interesting topic for those who make a study of the human mind and\nwould vainly attempt to explain some of the strange impressions made upon it.\nIt will be remembered that on February 2nd, Michael Conley, a farmer\nliving near Ionia, Chickasaw County, was found dead in an outhouse at the\nJefferson house. He was carried to Coroner Hoffmann's morgue, where, after\nthe inquest, his body was prepared for shipment to his late home. The old\ni See in this connection Mrs. Farnane's dream (S. P. R. Journal, July, 1891, p. 105),\nwhere a mother sees her son lying dead, under circumstances fairly corresponding\nwith those which had accompanied his death, unknown to her, a few days previously.\n2 See also Proceedings, Vol. III., 95, sqq. ;\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, iL-c. 201\nclothes which he wore were covered with filth from the place where he was\nfound and they were thrown outside the morgue on the ground.\nHis son came from Ionia and took the corpse home. When he reached\nthere and one of the daughters was told that her father was dead, she feE\ninto a swoon, in which she remained for several hours. When at last she was\nbrought from the swoon, she said, \" Where are father's old clothes 1 He has\njust appeared to mo dressed in a white shirt, black clothes, and felt [mis-\nreported for satin] slippers, and told me that after leaving home he sewed a\nlarge roll of bills inside his grey shirt with a piece of my red dress and the\nmoney is still there.\" In a short time she fell into another swoon and when\nout of it demanded that somebody go to Dubuque and get the clothes. She\nwas deathly sick, and is so yet.\nThe entire family considered it ouly a hallucination, but the physician\nadvised them to get the clothes, as it might set her mind at rest. The son\ntelephoned Coroner Hoffmann asking if the clothes were still in his possession.\nHe looked and found them in the backyard, although he had supposed they\nwere thrown in the vault as he had intended. He answered that he still had\nthem, and on being told that the son would come to get them, they were\nwrapped in a bundle.\nThe young man arrived last Monday afternoon and told Coroner Hoffmann\nwhat his sister had said. Mr. Hoffmann admitted that the lady had described\nthe identical burial garb in which her father was clad, even to the slippers,\nalthough she never saw him after death, and none of the family had seen\nmore than his face through the coffin lid. Curiosity being fully aroused, they\ntook the grey shirt from the bundle and within the bosom found a large roll\nof bills sewed with a piece of red cloth. The young man said his sister had\na red dress exactly like it. The stitches were large and irregular, and looked\nto be those of a man. The son wrapped up the garments and took them\nhome with him yesterday morning, filled with wonder at the supernatural\nrevelation made to his sister, who is at present lingering between life and death.\nThe Herald, Ham and Carver, Proprietors, Dubuque,\nIowa, March 2ml, 1891.\nMr. Richard Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014Replying to inquiry of February 25th, would say that the\nfacts in case you mention are as stated in an article published in the Herald\nof February 11th, a copy of which is enclosed.

The following\nMonday, February 9th, the son returned, as stated in my article of February\n11th.

Ferris, Earlville, la.\nDear Brother, \u2014You asked me to write you out a statement of facts\nregarding the Conley girl, who has caused so much newspaper comment con\ncerning an alleged vision of hers. She is of Irish parentage ; socially,\nrather above the avorage as to respectability ; of the Roman Catholic faith,\nyet commonly regarded as quite free from a superstitious tendency ; and\nintellectually, rather above the average, though possessed of a limited\neducation. The community is divided as to the merits of the case. Many\nof the most intelligent citizens, and those most intimately acquainted with\nall the circumstances, are pronounced in their unbelief in anything \" super\nnatural \" connected with the dream Miss Conley had. No one doubts her\n\u00abincerity. At times she is regarded as partially deranged in mind since her\nfather's death.\nPersonally, I am inclined to join with the sceptical as to any supernatural\nvision appearing to Miss Conley ; but am free to admit that I am unable to\naccount for some features of the case, admitting as I must the veracity and\nsincerity of the young lady and her brother.\nIf I have omitted any point concerning which you would like to inquire,\nlet me know, and I will try to answer to the best of my ability.\nL.

She was present\nand engaged in her domestic labours. When I stated the object of my call,\nshe seemed quite reluctant for a moment to engage in conversation. Then\nshe directed a lad who was present to leave the room. She said she would\nconverse with me upon the matter pertaining to her father.\nQ. : What is your age ? A. : Twenty-eight.\nQ. : What is the state of your health ? A. : Not good since my father's\ndeath.\nQ. : What was the state of your health previous to his death 1 A. : It\nwas good. I was a healthy girl.\nQ. : Did you have dreams, visions, or swoons previous to your father's\ndeath ? A. : Why, I had dreams. Everybody has dreams.\nQ. : Have you ever made discoveries or received other information during\nyour dreams or visions previous to your father's death ? A. : No.\nQ. : Had there been anything unusual in your dreams or visions previous\nto your father's death ? A. : No, not that I know of.\nQ. : Was your father in the habit of carrying considerable sums of money\nabout his person ? A. : Not that I knew of.\nQ. : Did you know before his death of the pocket in the breast of the\nshirt worn by him to Dubuque ? A. : No.\nQ. : Did you wash or prepare that shirt for him to wear on his trip to\nDubuque ? A. : No. It was a heavy woollen undershirt, and the pocket was\nstitched inside of the breast of it.\nQ. : Will you recite the circumstances connected with the recovery of\nmoney from clothing worn by your father at the time of his death? A.\n(after some hesitation) : When they told me that father was dead I felt very\nsick and bad ; I did not know anything. Then father came to me. He had\non a white shirt and black clothes and slippers. When I came to, I told Pat\nfher brother] I had seen father. I asked him (Pat) if he had brought back\nfather's old clothes. He said \"No,\" and asked me why I wanted them. I\ntold him father said to me he had sewed a roll of bills inside of his grey\nshirt, in a pocket made of a piece of my old red dress. I went to sleep,\nand father came to me again. When I awoke, I told Pat he must go and get\nthe clothes.\nQ. : While in these swoons did you hear the ordinary conversations or\nnoises in the house about you ? A. : No.\nQ. : Did you see your father's body after it was placed in its coffin ?\nA. : No ; I did not see him after he left the house to go to Dubuque.\nQ. : Have you an education ? A. : No.\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 205\nQ. : Can you read and write 1 A. : Oh yes, I can read and write ; but\nI've not been to school much.\nQ. : Are you willing to write out what you have told me of this strange\naffair ? A. : Why I've told you all I know about it.\nShe was averse to writing or to signing a written statement. During the\nconversation she was quite emotional, and manifested much effort to suppress\nher feelings. She is of little more than medium size, of Irish parentage, of\nCatholic faith, and shows by her conversation that her education is limited.\nHer brother, Pat Conley, corroborates all that she has recited. He is a\nsincere and substantial man, and has no theory upon which to account for\nthe strange facts that have come to his knowledge. In his presence, Coroner\nHoffmann, in Dubuque, found the shirt with its pocket of red cloth stitched\non the inside with long, straggling, and awkward stitches, just as a dim-\nsighted old man or an awkward boy might sew it there. The pocket was\nabout 7 [seven] inches deep, and in the pocket of that dirty old shirt that\nhad lain in Hoffmann's back room was a roll of bills amounting to 35 dollars.\nWhen the shirt was found with the pocket, as described by his sister after\nher swoon\u2014and the money as told her by the old man after his death, Pat\nConley seemed dazed and overcome by the mystery. Hoffmann says the girl,\nafter her swoon, described exactly the burial suit, shirt, coat or robe, and\nsatin slippers, in which the body was prepared for burial. She even described\nminutely the slippers, which were of a new pattern that had not been in the\nmarket here, and which the girl could never have seen a sample of ; and she\nhad not seen, and never saw, the body of her father after it was placed in the\ncoffin, and if she had seen it she could not have seen his feet \" in the nice\nblack satin slippers \" which she described.\nYou may write this Conley incident down as a simple, honest thing. It\nis unquestionably genuine.\nI send you two letters from citizens of Ionia, who are certified to me by\nthe Rev. J. M. Ferris, concerning the Conleys. Mr. Ferris allows me to\nsend the letters as received. They were obtained at my request from old\nfriends of the Rev. Mr. Ferris. I have done all I could to get the bottom\nfacts.- -Cordially yours,\nAmos Crum, Pastor Univ. Church.\nDubuque, la.\nIf we may accept the details of this narrative, which seems to have\nbsen carefully and promptly investigated, we find that the phantasm\ncommunicates two sets of facts ; one of them known only to strangers\n(the dress in which he was buried), and one of them known only to\nhimself (the existence of the inside pocket and the money therein).\nIn discussing from what mind these images originate it is of course\nimportant to note whether any living minds, known or unknown to\nthe percipient, were aware of the facts thus conveyed.\nThe second instance occurs at the beginning of a series of experiences,\nwhich, for convenience' sake, may here be given entire. The coinci\ndences involved are not all of them equally striking ; but their frequent\nrepetition with the same percipient is a fact of interest.\n\f20G Mr. F. W. H.

I could not go to the funeral\nmyself owing to pressure of business, but all of my family went.\nAbout two months later I was sitting alone with my wife at supper when\nI felt an extraordinary heat down the spinal cord, preceded by a shock\nresembling an electric shock. It made me start. . My wife asked the reason.\nI told her that I saw Frank (i.e., her brother) with his mother (who had died\nabout eight years previously) standing behind mo. I explained that he was\ndressed as I had never seen him\u2014the shirt being very deep and wide open.\nMy wife then told me that he had been laid out in precisely that way. I had\nnot heard any details of his laying out.\n(Signed) Wilson Quint.\nThe above is correct.\n(Confirmation of wife) J. W. Quint.\nA year ago I went to Maiden to pay a business visit in the evening to a\ngentleman there, Mr. M. I had been on two previous occasions to the house\nand stayed but a moment or two, as my visits were of a very brief business\nnature. On the first visit I had seen Mr. M. and his wife, and I have a faint\nrecollection of seeing some children at the house.\nOn the second visit I saw Mr. M. for a moment at the door.\nOn this last occasion, as I entered the house I felt my head enveloped in\na cloud, as it were, though I did not see anything. I sat down with Mr. M.\nHis wife came into the room, and, as she shook hands, she said, \"We have\nmet with a great trial. Yesterday we buried our little girl. She was run\nover and killed almost immediately. She breathed but once after entering\nthe house.\" Almost as soon as she had finished speaking, I saw the figure of\na little girl standing at the right hand of Mr. M. I did not mention this at\nonce, but first said a few words of comfort, and then stated that with their\npermission I would tell them what I saw. They desired me to tell them, and\nI described the figure. \"She was dressed in light clothing, not what you\nwould call calico, I think, but probably you would call it muslin. She is\nround-favoured, blue eyes, light hair. A peculiarity of her dress is what we\nused to call a tire tied loosely round the neck and loosely round the waist at\nthe back.\"\nI then rose to go. Mrs. M. sprang from her seat and caught me by the\nhand, saying, \" Mr. Quint, the description of our little one is perfect.\" Mr.\nM. also said that the description was perfect.\n(Signed) Wilson Quint.\n[Mre. M. writes that they wish to be excused from giving their testi\nmony.\u2014R.H.]\nIn a savings bank where I am employed, a lady, of apparently about fifty\nyears of age, was waiting to be attended to, and she spoke to me with regard\nto business matters, saying that she found it difficult to manage her husband's\naffairs. I said, Did your head come to about your husband's shoulder ?\nYes.\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, d-c. 207\nDid your husband wear a long frock coat buttoned up ? Yes.\nDid he wear a silk hat ? Yes. But why do you ask these questions ?\nI explained to her that I saw a figure standing a few paces behind her as\nI described it.\nI do not know who the lady was, and have never seen her before or since.\n(Signed) Wilson Quint.\nAbout a year ago, when treating a rheumttic patient by massage treat\nment and passes, I saw the figure of a young man standing at her right\nhand holding a hat in his hand. I mentioned the circumstance to her and\nshe said that a son of hers had died about a year before, and that it might\npossibly be he. Nothing further special was said at that time, but the scene\nrecurred to me in reflection, and I wondered why the figure should be hold\ning a hat, so peculiar as it seemed to be. On my next visit two weeks later, I\nquestioned the lady about the hat and described it in detail. It was a form\nof Derby, but the top was square like a silk hat. She was much surprised,\nand told me that that was the identical shape of hat that her son had always\npersisted in wearing.\n[The above is perfectly correct in every respect. To me it is wonderful. I\nam the mother of the young man.\n(Signed) Mrs. Maria E. Fisher.]\nI have had experiences of this kind occasionally for about three years,\nperhaps eighteen or twenty of them. The forms are just as vivid and real in\nevery way, so far as vision goes, as living men and women. They disappear\nby gradually fading away\u2014vanishing like a cloud. I have never touched any\nof the forms.\nAbout two and a half years ago, I called upon a friend one Sunday morn\ning, and while conversing with him, just after he had made some reference to\nhis daughter, I saw three figures in the corner of the room in the direction of\nhis right I described them to him as follows : \u2014\n\" I see a young lady about eighteen years of age, an elderly lady with her\nwith a cap on, and another lady a little in the rear of them and between them,\napparently about thirty-five years of age.\" He recognised them as his wife,\nhis mother, and his daughter, and informed me that his daughter had died at\nthe age of eighteen, and his wife at the age of thirty-five.\nI had never seen these persons living, so far as I know, but I believe I\nhad heard that these two members of his family had died.\nWilson Quint.\nEverett, April 13<\/i, 1891.\nI remember perfectly well the circumstances as related above.\nG. H. Burr.\nMarch 21s\/, 1891.\nAbout six or seven mouths ago I was talking with a friend of mine, Mr.\nDill, when 1 saw the figure of a man somewhat past middle age half reclining\nbehind him, as though leaning to the right on one side of a chair, though I\ndid not see any chair. I described the figure to Mr. Dill at his request as\nfollows : \" Light complexion, blue eyes, round-favoured, with broad fore\n\f208 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nhead and not a superfluous quantity of hair on the front of his head. The\npeculiarity of his dress was a buff waistcoat, with noticeable watchchain and\nfob hanging down by the buttons.\"\nMr. Dill recognised upon the instant a man whom he had known, an old\nfriend, down at Cape Cod, who had been gone a number of years. I knew\nnothing whatever about any such person.\nWilson Quint.\nEverett, April 2nd, 1891.\nThe above statement is true as far as I am able to recognise one from a\ndescription of his person. The person described was Captain J. J. Jacobs, of\nWenfleet, Mass. N. S. C. Dill.\nI may here mention a dream-case recorded in Phantasms of tin\nLiving, Vol. I., p. 365, with regard to which we have since learnt an\ninteresting detail. The case is briefly as follows : About March, 185\",\nMrs. Menneer in England dreamt that she saw her brother, whose\nwhereabouts she did not know, standing headless at the foot of the\nbed, with his head lying on a coffin by his side. The dream was at\nonce mentioned. It afterwards appeared that at about that time the\nhead of the brother seen, Mr. Wellington, was actually cut off by\nChinese at Sarawak. On this case Mr. Gurney remarks : \" This dream,\nif it is to be telepathically explained, must apparently have been due\nto the last flash of thought in the brother's consciousness. It may\nseem strange that a definite picture of his mode of death should present\nitself to a man in the instant of receiving an unexpected and fatal\nblow ; but, as Hobbes said, 'Thought is quick.' The coffin, at any rate,\nmay be taken as an item of death-imagery supplied by the dreamer's\nmind.\"\nWe have now, howeier, seen a letter from Sir James Brooke\n(Rajah of Sarawak) and an extract from the Straits Times of March\n21st, 1857, in the (London) Times for April 29th, 1857, which make it,\nI think, quite conceivable that the dream was a reflection of know\nledge acquired by Mr. Wellington after death, and that the head on\nthe coffin had a distinct meaning. Sir James Brooke says: \" Poor\nWellington's remains were consumed [by the Chinese] ; his head, borne\noff in triumph, alone attesting his previous murder.\" The Straits\nTimes says: \"The head was given up on the following day.\" The\nhead, therefore, and the head alone, must undoubtedly have been\nburied by Mr. Wellington's friends ; and its appearance in the dream\non a coffin, with the headless body standing beside it, is a coincidence\neven more significant than the facts which Mr. Gurney had before him\nwhen he wrote.\nSomewhat similar is a case of waking apparition sent by Dr. and\nMrs. Entwistle to Dr. Hcxlgson, where the phantom of a man who\ndies of a sudden wound,\u2014certainly of a more ordinary type than Mr.\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, iL-c. 209\nWellington's decapitation !\u2014is seen with the wound, while the body is\nlying in the morgue.\nG. 223.\nEnglewood, May 19th, 1891.\nMr. Richard Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014Your invitation, as indicated by yours of May 14th, at\nhand, and reminds me of a recent experience of my husband. It occurred\nthe latter part of February, 1891. I will call my husband Doctor, as he is\na physician. The others I will give true initials ; but as they might object,\nwill not give full names. One morning, about nine o'clock, the latter part\nof February, the Doctor was walking rapidly along Sixty-third-street for the\nstation to catch a train bound for the city, Chicago, some seven miles\ndistant. He crossed over from the south side to the north side of the\nstreet, and looking up ahead of him saw Mr. M. coming- -a man who was\na drinking profligate, and who boarded in the city, and a carouser who\nturned night into day, but one whom the doctor had known for twenty\nyears, and had seen, perhaps, every few weeks, as he might meet him in the\nGrand Pacific Hotel in the city. So his first thought in seeing him was,\n\" You must have had an early start.\" He noted in his mind his clothes, his\novercoat, his hat, and that he looked begrimed and cold. He kept looking\nat him, and Mr. M. looked directly at the Doctor with such a woe-begone,\nGod-forsaken expression. The Doctor noticed he was bruised, and had a\ncertain shaped cut under one eye, and he thought, \"Well, you must have\nbeen on a regular tear.\" Not caring to be stopped, he passed him without\nspeaking ; and Mr. M. turned his head, and kept watching him with that\nsame forlorn expression, that the Doctor felt in his heart he ought to have\nspoken, and hesitated, thinking to go after him, but did not, as he (Mr. M.)\ncrossed the street, and went down Yale, and was lost to view, though he\nlooked around at the Doctor. When the Doctor got on the train he met\nMr. L., a brother-in-law of mine, and he told him that he just met Charley\nM., and he should judge he had been on a terrible tear, and went on telling\nhim as I have told, mentioning this cut, and telling under which eye it was,\n&c. Mr. L. asked where he (Mr. M.) went, and the Doctor said, \"Why, he\nwent down Yale, and I suppose he was going down to see his wife.\" \"Oh,\nno,\" said Mr. L., \"his wife won't allow him round.\" (His wife had\nobtained a divorce some years before.) So the two arrived in the city, and\nwent to the Grand Pacific, and met Mr. A. B., who had a Tribune in his\nhand, and he said, \"Charley M., I guess, is dead, for here is a notice in the\npaper that seems it must be him lying in the morgue for identification,\nalthough the name is not quite right.\" Before he finished the Doctor spoke\n. up and said, \"It is not he, for I just met him in Englewood.\" \"Yes,\"\nsaid Mr. L., \"he told me about it.\" Mr. A. B. said, \" Why, my brother,\nMr. W. B. (who was a brother-in-law to the dead man), has gone to the\nmorgue to see if it is Mr. M. ; but, of course, if you met him, why it\ncan't be.\" So the Doctor took the Tribune and read the notice, and said,\n\"This says Mr. N., and says so-and-so ; and shows on the face of it they\ndid not know as he was dressed so-and-so, and had a cut under such an eye.\nThen, anyway, I saw him within the hour alive.\" After a while Mr. W. B.\ncame in, and said it was Mr. M. sure enough ; that he was going out to\n\f210 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nEnglewood to inform Mrs. M., which he did, and the body was cared for\nand buried. As matters turned out it seems that he had some drunken brawl\nin some low dive, and the conclusion was he was thrown out, was found by\nthe police unconscious, was taken to the county hospital, where he died\nwithin a few hours, still unconscious, was taken to the morgue to await,\nidentification, and the notice put in the one paper, probably by some night\nreporter. It also came out that the Doctor's description was exactly so, and\nthat the time he met the man his body was lying in the morgue. Now, these\nare the main facts. If there are any questions that the Doctor can answer,\nhe is willing to do so. M. L. Entwistle.\nJ. G. W. Entwistle, M.D.\nInvestigating a Death.\nC. H. N., a veteran pensioner, became involved in a quarrel at the\nWestern House on Clark-street, near Van Buren, and was ejected. He was\nfound by the police on the sidewalk, taken first to the station and later to\nthe county hospital, where he died last evening. The case is being investi\ngated.\u2014The Chicago Tribune, February 10th, 1891.\nM.\u2014Monday, February 9th, at the Cook County Hospital, C. H. M.,\naged 47 years, late member of the Chicago Board of Trade Battery. Notice\nof funeral later.\u2014The Chicago Tribune, February 11th, 1891.\nDr. Entwistle's companion adds the following corroboration :\u2014\n\"I think some details in the latter part of the above narrative have not\nbeen told nearly strongly enough.\n', After Dr. Entwistle and myself reached the city, we went immediately\nto the hotel, and meeting Mr. A. B., sat down and entered into conversation\nwith him on general subjects. Some gentleman, unknown to either of us,\nstepped up and pointing out a notice in the morning paper, asked A. B. if\nhe thought it referred to C. M., as the name in print was misspelled. A. B.\nimmediately expressed himself that it was C. M. , and then Dr. E., reading\nthe notice, said it could not be, as he had met M. at Englewood that morn\ning. I stated that it was a fact, as the Doctor had told me, and we had\ntalked of the circumstance on the way to the city. This seemed to convince\nA. B. that it was not M., as he knew Dr. Entwistle was well acquainted\nwith M., and would not be liable to be misled. At this time W. B., a\nbrother-in-law of M.'s, joined us, and the matter of the notice brought to his\nattention, he suggested that he and the stranger (who we afterwards\nlearned was an army companion of M.'s) should visit the morgue. This they\ndid. although A. B. protested that it was no use, from the fact that M. had\nbeen seen that morning at Englewood. Upon returning from the morgue,\nW. B. told us it was M., and went on to describe his marks and clothing,\nwhich tallied in every particular with the description given me by the\nDoctor in the morning.\n\"C. L.\u00ab\n\" March 22nrf, 1892.\"\n} In another case, which we owe to the kindness oF Lord Bute, the face of the\ndeceased was seen with wraps which apparently corresponded to some r.ither\nunusual swathings after death. Mrs. Pilkington, of Valloy Lodgp, Scarborough,\ntells us that some years ago an aunt of hers died in London. \"About 3 months\n\fOn Indication* of Continued Terrene Knowledge, d-c. 211\nI have already (Vol. VI., p. 31) mentioned the \"curious type of\ncases where some manifestation occurs just before the news of the\ndeath is received by the percipient.\" Some more narratives of this\nkind have reached us ; \u2014thus illustrating what we often find to be the\ncase, that these phenomena do really fall into natural groups,\u2014although\nthose groups are often such as we had no previous reason for anticipating.\nIt is evidentially important to observe that these apparitions occur\nbefore and not after the news has been actually communicated. The\nmoment after the communication may be taken as that of maximum\nshock, and if the recipient of the news were then to see a phantom of\nhis friend, one might well suppose that this was the mere embodiment\nof his own agitated grief. But I do not remember any instance (except\nConley's, just quoted) where the apparitionfollowed on the receipt of\nthe news. And in Conley's case the phantom showed its reality, as\nwe have seen, in other ways. Apart from that case (so far as 1 know)\nthe apparition has always preceded the arrival of the letter or messenger\nannouncing the death.\nWhat mind, then, is it which knows that the letter is coming ? We\nhave elsewhere remarked that this sense of an approaching letter seems\nsometimes to occur as a form of clairvoyance, where no mind other than\nthe percipient's can be supposed to be specially interested in the letter's\narrival. On the other hand, if spirits still in the flesh may jwssess\nafterwards she appeared to me in this way. I beheld her in my room near the. door.\nI noticed that her head was much enveloped and that her mouth was covered over.\nI wrote an account of this to my sister who was with hsr at her death.\" \"My sister\ndid not keep my letter, but she told me that previous to death my aunt's head had\nbeen much enveloped by shawls, as she complained so much of the cold ; and that\nafter death blood had issued from the mouth, caused by her complaint, bronchitis,\nso that her mouth was covered over after her death.'' But here the habitual mental\npicture of a corpse as swathed about the head seems to come too near to the\napparition actually seen to allow us to ascribe evidential force to the coincidence\nin the wrappings.\nI might add here a reference to Mr. Romilly's account of tho phantasm of\nthe murdered Kimueli, with bandages such as bad actually been placed on his\nhead {Proceedimji, Vol. VI., p. 55). But Mr. Allardyce (with whom we were\nunable previously to communicate, owing to ignorance of his address) has now\nreturned to England ; and we learn from him that ho did not himself see the figure\nof Kimueli, and that his journal contains no record of Mr. Romilly's having seen\nKimueli ;\u2014although he knows that the natives were on the look-out for the ghost.\nN'ow Mr. Komilly does not precisely say that Mr. Allardyce saw the figure ; but\nMr. Allardyce's account leads us to think that Mr. Romilly's experience may have\nbeen a mero subjective hallucination, caused by expectation, and which, even if\nshared by superstitious natives, cannot count as evidential.\nI may mention that we have succeeded in tracing one of Mr. Owen's\ninformants in the Children case (Vol. VI., p. 5t). This lady is, as Mr. Owen said, of\ngood position ; but she dislikes the topic, and partly (as she tells us) from defect of\nmemory, partly from some private reason, she declines to correspond further on the\nmatter. We can only regiet t!,at Mr. Owen did not obtain first-hand signed state\nments at the time.\n\f212 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nclairvoyant power we cannot say that difcirnate spirits may not pissess\nsuch power also ; perhaps specially as to matters relating to their own\nearth-history,\u2014such as the diffusion of news of their own demise.\nFor the present we must confine ourselves to noting these cases as they\noccur.\nBut before proceeding to new cases, I may mention that Mr.\nCameron Grant's case (Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 690, and\nProceedings, Vol. VI., p. 31) has been further strengthened, by\npermission to print the passages from Mr. Grant's diary, and by inter\nviews of my own with the widow and daughter of the decedent. Lord\nZ., (not the true initial,) who were present at the time of the death.\nThe following is Mr. Grant's statement, made to me July 28th,\n1889:\u2014\n\" The first form in which this impression came to me was that of deep\nsympathy for [a member of Lord Z.'s family]. After this had lasted for\nsome time I found myself rudely drawing a tall man stooping forwards on to\nanother man. I had a conviction that Lord Z. was dead,\u2014that the falling\nforward indicated death. I also dimly perceived the position of windows\nbehind the falling figure, though I did not draw these. I wrote to my mother\nat once to say that 1 knew that Lord Z. was dead. [Letter not preserved.] I\nwas then up the country in Brazil, and saw few papers. I heard from\nEngland that Lord Z. was dead ; but (as I told Mr. Gimiey) did not look for\ndate in papers, and did not, so far us I know, hear the (Lite in any letter.\n\"On reaching England I was partially hypnotised by a physician of my\nacquaintance [name given] ; but did not lose consciousness. During my\nsemi-trance I became aware that I was seeing the room and windows and the\nfalling figure, more clearly than ever before. I talked of this scene to the\nphysician. Afterwards he invited me to look in a crystal. I did so ; and\nsaw the same room ;\u2014the windows, bed, and figure, more distinctly.\n\" I afterwards went to stay in the house where Lord Z. died. As soon as\nI entered I asked Lady Z. to allow me to describe to her the room where I\nhad seemed to see Lord Z. dying. Lady Z. was at first incredulous ; but on\nmy describing the position of bed and windows she admitted that it was\ncorrect. Lord Z. had died in a dressing-room adjacent to his bedroom. The\ntemporary bed and windows were exactly as I had seen them. He had\nfallen forwards into the arms of a male attendant, dying suddenly.''\nThe first impression of the death,\u2014which was nearly coinriitcnt,\u2014was on\nDecember 24th, 1885 (date verified by Mr. Gurney). Entry in diary\nDecember 25th, 1885 : There was something upon my mind all day from\nyesterday,\u2014a sense of a death or loss of someone dear to me. I spoke to\nE.C. [Mr. Catlin, the manager, who wrote in corroboration] about it ; and I\ndon't know how it is, but as 1 wrote the above [a member of Lord Z.'s\nfamily] has been constantly in my thoughts.\nThen on Tuesday, January 2<ith, 1886, is an entry,\u2014read by me in Mr.\nGrant's journal, and copied for me by him,\u2014as follows : -\n\"Impression at about 1 o'clock and drawing and reasoning therefrom\non death.\"\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 213\nJanuary 27th. \" Very tired, but did not sleep a wink all night. I am\nsure that something has happened to [a member of Lord Z.'s family]. I\nheard every hour strike, and kept thinking of [all the members of the\nfamily] but nut of the dear old gentleman [i.e., imagining them in sorrow,\nbut not Lord Z. himself]. I got up and wanted to draw him. His features\nseemed before me. I had before shown Mr. Catlin a face in the Graphic that\nwas like him, also that of a dead man. I had the greatest difficulty not to\ndraw his portrait with his head forward and sunk on his breast, as if he had\nbeen sitting in a room with a window on his right hand and an old man\nservant ;\u2014and then his head just went forward, and he fell asleep. Weeks\nago [i.e., December 25th] I thought of him,-\u2014sometime about Christmas;\nand ever since I have been feeling [pity, &c., for members of family].\nOn the next day, Thursday, January 28th, 1886, Mr. Grant received by\naccident a Scotch paper in which Lord Z.'s death was mentioned,\u2014but\napparently without the precise date.\nI have received a letter, (which I have unfortunately mislaid,) from Mr.\nCatlin, corroborating Mr. Grant's statements as to his having shown him\ndrawings and spoken of the death of a friend at home.\nLady Z. and Miss Z. gave me, in April, 1892, the following corrobora\ntion :\u2014\nLord Z. died December 24th, 1885, in a dressing-room adjoining his own\nlarger room. The dressing-room was narrow, with a window at one end, and\na small bed, then occupied by a man-servant who attended on him. Lord Z.\nhad entered this room to speak to the servant, when he fell forward, the\nservant catching him in his arms, and shortly afterwards breathed his last.\nHis death was unexpected, although he had long been ill. I remember that\nMr. Cameron Grant visited our country seat,\u2014where this occurred,\u2014for the\nfirst time some months after Lord Z. 's death ; and that he said something to\nme as to his having known of it, or recognised the scene ; but I cannot now\nremember the details. (Signed) [Lady Z. ]\nI remember that Mr. Cameron Grant, before going upstairs, when he\narrived on the visit referred to, asked whether my father had not fallen\nforwards into the arms of a man, in a long room with a window at one end\nof it. (Signed) [Miss Z.]\nThis case should be studied along with Mr. Cameron Grant's other\nrecords of experiences (Phantasms of the Living, II., pp. <i88-090).\nIt would in a certain way explain these intimations if we could suppose\nthat Lord Z., (who was, and who knew Mr. Grant to be, much interested in\nsuch phenomena,) first impressed Mr. Grant at the time of his own death,\nand then renewed the impression when he knew\u2014in some inconceivable\nmanner\u2014that Mr. Grant was about to receive, quite casually, a newspaper\nannouncement of the decease. On that occasion the decedent seems to have\nbeen able to impress a picture of the scene of death on Mr. Grant's\nsubconscious mind ; an impression which worked itself out in the rude\ndrawings, as a \" motor message,\" and afterwards returned both as a vision\nin hypnotic trance, and as a \"crystal-vision\" in the waking state. Here,\nhowever, as in all similar cases, we cannot exclude the possibility of a wide\nclairvoyance on the percipient's own part. The full psychical history of\n\f214 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nevery such percipient should he studied ;\u2014a matter hard of attainment in\nMr. Grant's case, owing to his absorption in business, and his residence at\nMarahu, in Brazil.\nIn the first new case which I shall quote there was already a vivid\nemotional shock in neighbouring minds, from the receipt of the\nmessage, which may have facilitated\u2014some may say have caused\u2014the\napparition seen by the man to whom the news had not yet been de\nlivered.\nThis letter was addressed to the late Professor Adams, at Cambridge.\nG. 210.\nSt. Luke's Church, Cer Van Ness-avenue, and Clay-street,\nSan Francisco, California, September 11th, 1890.\nDear Sir,\u2014I received to-day from some officer of your Society a few\ncirculars re your work. These circulars remind me of an interesting and\ncurious occurrence in my parish a few weeks ago, which may be useful as a\ncontribution to your investigations. I will detail it briefly and without\nnames ; but if you find it valuable will try to obtain affidavits, Ac. Let me\npremise by saying that I am in the position of \" reserving my judgment \"\nabout such phenomena as you investigate. I do not deny that such things\noccur, nor have I of my own experience any knowledge on the subject.\nMy choir-trainer, a man in robust health and with a predisposition against\nanything \" Spiritualistic,\" saw plainly the apparition of one of his choir, a\nman of fifty years old. It happened thus :\u2014\nMr. R[ussell], the bass-singer of the choir, fell in an apoplectic fit upon the\nstreet at 10 o'clock on a certain Friday ; he died at 11 o'clock at his house.\nMy wife, learning of his death, sent my brother-in-law down to the house of\nthe choirmaster [Mr. Reeves] to ask him about music for the funeral. The\nmessenger reached the house of the choirmaster about 1.30 p.m. He was told\nthat the choirmaster was upstairs, busy looking over some music. He\naccordingly sat down in the drawing-room, and, while waiting, began to tell\nthe ladies (sister and niece of the choirmaster) about Mr. R.'s death. While\nthey were talking they heard an exclamation in the hall-way. Someone said,\n\" My God ! \" They rushed out, and halfway down, sitting on the stairs, saw\nthe choirmaster in his shirt-sleeves, showing signs of great fright and con\nfusion. As soon as he saw them he exclaimed, \" I have just seen R. ! \" The\nniece at once said, \" Why, R. is dead ! \" At this the choirmaster without a\nword turned back upstairs and went to his room. My brother-in-law\nfollowed him and found him in complete prostration, his face white, Ac. He\nthen told my brother-in-law what he had experienced.\nHe had been looking over some music ; had just selected a \"Te Deum\" for\nthe morning service. This \"Te Deum\" closed with a quartette setting fortwo\nbass and two tenor voices. He . was wondering where he could get a second\ntenor. Finally, he went to the door on his way downstairs to look up\nanother \" Te Deum.\" At the door he' saw Mr. R., who stood with one\nhand on his brow, and one hand extended, holding a sheet of music. The\nchoirmaster advanced, extended his hand, and was going to speak, when the\nfigure vanished. Then it was that ho gave the exclamation mentioned above.\n\fOn Indications of Continued. Terrene Knowledge, &c. 215\nYou must remember that he knew nothing of R.'s death until ho\nheard his niece speak of it as detailed above.\nThis is the best authenticated ghost story I ever heard. I know all the\nparties well, and can vouch for their truthfulness. I have no doubt that the\nchoirmaster saw something, either subjectively or objectively. Whatever it\nwas, the experience was so vivid that it made him sick for days, though he\nis a man of exceptional physique.\nAt first I tried to explain this on natural grounds. I thought possibly ho\nhad been in the room overhead, and had overheard, unconsciously, the story\nof R.'s death, and by a process of unconscious cerebration summoned up\nthe image of the dead man. But this is impossible, because the house is very\nlarge, the rooms widely apart, &c.\nMy present conviction is this : Mr. R. was a man of the utmost regu\nlarity and faithfulness in fulfilling his duties. He has sung for us without\npay for many years. His first thought (or one of the first), after his stroke\nof apoplexy, must have been : \" How shall I get word to the choirmaster\nthat I cannot go to rehearsal to-morrow night ? \" In an hour he died,\nwithout ever having recovered consciousness. My notion is that in some\nway he was enabled to make himself appear to the choirmaster. If you refer\nto the attitude in which he appeared, you will see that it answers to my\nsupposition. It indicates his illness (a pain in the head), and his desire to\ngive up, so to speak, his duty as singer.\nYou probably have many other incidents of this nature on record. If\nyou have any theory about them I wish you would send me a copy of whatever\nyou have bearing on this.\nIt is interesting to me because it is so perfectly authenticated.\u2014Yours\nfaithfully, Wh. W. Davis,Rector.\nMr. Reeves' own account is reported in the San Francisco Chronicle\n(quoted in Light, September 27th, 1890) as \"a tale told to a Chronicle reporter\nby a gentleman who would be at once pronounced the last person in tho\nworld to become the prey of superstition or the victim of delusion.\n\"Early on Friday morning Edwin Russell, an Englishman, well known as\na real estate agent, was walking near the corner of Sutter and Mason streets\nwhen he sustained an apoplectic stroke, from the effects of which he died\nshortly before noon. He had resided in the city ten years, and was well and\nfavourably known in the commercial world here.\n\" Mr. Russell was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and also\nthe possessor of a rich bass voice. This made him a welcome addition to the\nchoir of St. Luke's Church, and brought him in immediate contact with tho\nRev. W. W. Davis, vicar of the church, and with Harry E. Reeves, the\nrecently appointed choir leader. Mr. Reeves is a nephew of the distinguished\nEnglish tenor of the name, and conducted the musical services at the funeral\nof President Chester A. Arthur.\n'' It was to Mr. Reeves that the very sensational and startling revelation\nnow to be recorded was vouchsafed. Mr. Reeves was found at the residence\nof his sister, Mrs. Cavanagh, 2,121, California-street, by a Chronicle reporter.\nHe became evidently agitated when asked if it were true that he had seen tho\napparition of Russell before hearing of the latter's death.\n\f216 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\" ' I will tell you all about it,' said Mr. Reeves, 'and, if you allow me, I\nwill illustrate the matter by showing you the positions I occupied during this\nstrange affair. I want to say at once that I am not a Spiritualist, and have\nalways been very sceptical about all stories of post-mortem appearances and\nghosts generally.\n\" ' I last saw Russell alive on the Saturday night previous to his death.\nRussell came to the choir rehearsal. I said to him : \" Do you know where I\ncan get a good cigar ? \" tmd he recommended a place. I went there with him,\nand then took such a fancy to him that I invited him to come to my house, or\nrather my sister's house. We agreed to postpone his visit till the following\nSaturday, and he said : \"Well, I'll call on you next week anyhow.\" The\nmatter passed from my mind until Friday afternoon, about three o'clock. I\nalways make it a point to look over my music for Sunday a day or two before,\nand on this occasion I was sitting in the parlour and took up two \"Te Deums\"\nto make a choice. One was Starkweather's in G, the other a composition of\nKroell's. Just as I had taken one in my hand and was going upstairs to my\nroom to look over it I heard the front door bell ring, and recognised that\nsome visitor whom I did not then know had called. I afterwards learned that\nit was young Mr. Sprague, who can tell you his story when you ask him.\n'\"I went into my room [illustrating the action as he ascended the stairs and\nopened the door into a well-lighted and comfortably-furnished sleeping apart\nment, with a lounge and parlour organ]. I lay down on the lounge for a\nmoment, then by an impulse I cannot account for, I walked to the door. Tho\nhead of the stairway was somewhat dimly lighted, as you see it now, but not\nso dimly but what I could at once see what appeared to be . the figure of\nRussell. It was so real, so lifelike, that I at once stepped forward and\nstretched out my hand, and was about to speak some words of welcome.\n' ' ' The figure seemed to have a roll of music in one hand and the other over\nits face, but it was Russell's image. I am quite sure of that. As I advanced\nto the head of the stairway the figure seemed to turn, as if about to descend,\nand faded into the air.'\n'' Mr. Reeves' manner during the recital was precisely that of a person with\nwell-balanced mind who had seen something horrible and startling, but was\nwilling and ready to accept a rational explanation if any were forthcoming.\nHe went on to say :\u2014\n\" ' I remember trying to speak to the figure, but the tongue clung to the\nroof of my mouth. Then I fell against the wall and gasped out. \"All ! My\nGod ! \" just like that. My sister and niece, with the other folks, came up.\nMy niece said, \" Uncle Harry, what's the matter?\" I went on to explain\nwhat it was, but was so scared I could hardly speak. My niece said, \" Don't\nyou know Russell is dead?\" Well, that flabbergasted me ; it only made\nmatters worse, and I nearly fainted. Then they told me that the Rev. Mr.\nDavis had sent Mr. Sprague to tell me of the sad news. I was terribly\nstartled by the affair, and feel shaky even now, but I am not given to super\nstitious fears, and I suppose it can be explained. Mr. Sprague had been\nwaiting nearly half an hour before I saw him and obtained corroboration of\nthe news of Russell's death. It is very strange ; very strange, indeed. I saw\nthat man Russell after he must have been dead three hours at least, as plainly\nas I see you in that chair.'\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, iL-c. 217\n\" In an interview with Mr. Sprague the essential features of this strange\nstory were confirmed. It is a significant departure from the routine ghost\nstory that all the persons connected with this case are unconnected with any\nSpiritualistic organisation, are of well-balanced mind, thoughtful, and\nsceptical on all sensational matters. Mr. Reeves is not only a man in the\nprime of life, of temperate habits, and in good health, but he is also a person\nof strong nerve, a man of the world, a Master Mason, and the last person in\nthe world to be scared by a ghost or a mediumistic imposition.\"\nMr. Reeves confirms this account in a letter to Dr. Hodgson as follows :\u2014\nSan Francisco, September 15th, 1890.\nRichard Hodgson, Esq.\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to your favour of 5th hat., just received, the\nfull particulars were given in city papers ; some things not just exactly as\nstated, especially the word \" flabbergasted,\" which is foreign to me.\nApart from what you read, there is nothing more to be given.\u2014With\nbest wishes, yours very truly,\nH. E. Reeves.\nWe have receiied the following independent and corroborative\naccount from Mr. Sprague :\u2014\nGoldwin S. Sprague.\nGrand Forks, Dak., Nwember 29th, 1890.\nMr. Richard Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014Your communication was received some time ago, but I have\nbeen greatly pressed for time and unable to answer.\nYou probably know all about Mr. Russell's death and connection with\nSt. Luke's Church, so I shall only give you the facts as they came to\nmy knowledge.\nOn Friday noon, August 22nd, a young lady friend of the Russells came\nto my brother-in-law's (Mr. Davis's) house and asked to see Mr. Davis. As\nMr. Davis was out, his wife (my sister) saw this young lady. I was not\npresent at the interview, but my sister told me shortly afterwards the facts\nof Mr. Russell's death, &c, and said that [this young lady had come to ask\nMr. Davis if the church choir would be willing to sing at Mr. Russell's\nfuneral, as Mr. R.'s family were of limited means and could not afford to\npay the choir.\nAs I was going to Mr. Reeves' house that afternoon my sister asked me\nto tell Mr. Reeves about Russell's death and ask him about the singing. I\ncalled at 1,221, California-street, about 3 [three] o'clock that afternoon, and\nhad been in the parlour some 20 [twenty] minutes talking with Miss\nKavanagh (Mr. Reeves' nieca), when we heard Mr. Reeves' exclamation on\nthe stairs, and I followed Miss Kavanagh to see what the trouble was. We\nfound Mr. R. sitting on the stairs in his shirt sleeves and evidently very\nmuch frightened. Miss K. brought him a glass of wine, also a glass of water,\nbut I think he did not touch either. After a couple of minutes Mr. R. went\nup to his room, and Miss Kavanagh asked me to go up and see if he was all\nright, as she was afraid to go. I went up and found Mr. Reeves sitting down\non a chair near the window with his legs crossed. He had no coat or vest,\ncollar or necktio on, and the perspiration seemed to roll off him. He seemed\n9.\n\f218 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ngreatly agitated, but in a few minutes he told me his story and I left him.\nIn about 5 [five] minutes he came downstairs and began to talk about it, and\ncontinually said, \" It is the strangest thing ; I can't understand it.\"\nGoldwin S. Spkague.\nThe next two cases are so grotesque that I have been tempted to\nsuppress them. But it is not my business to apologise for the forms\nwhich supernormal phenomena happen to take ; and the amount of\nevidence in each case seems enough to make it my duty to allow my\nreaders to form their own opinion.\nThe principal percipient in the case which here follows is known to\nme, and is a sensible witness, and much in earnest as to the reality of\nthis her unique supernormal experience.\nG. 211.\nWritten out by F. W. H. M., December 22nd, 1888, from notes taken\nduring an interview with Mrs. Davies the same day ; revised and signed\nby Mrs. Davies.\nAbout 20 years ago I was living with my mother and brother at Islington.\nNear us lived a family whose name is not important to the narrative. One\nof their daughters married a Mr. J. W., who wont to India. Mrs. J. W.\ncontinued living at her father's house. Her father, however, changed his\nresidence, and as Mr. J. W.'s address in India was not known at the time,\nMrs. J. W. could not inform him of the change of address. The house where\nshe was living with her father when her husband left home passed to a family\nwhom I will call Brown, with whom I was acquainted, as I also was with Mrs.\nJ. W. and her family.\nOne evening I paid a visit to Mrs. Brown, and she gave me an Indian\nletter which had arrived for Mrs. J. W. at the house now occupied by the\nBrowns. Mrs. Brown asked mo to transmit this letter to Mrs. J. W. through\nmy brother, who frequently saw a brother of Mrs. J. W.'s. There had thus\nbeen some little delay, and perhaps slackness, in getting the letter sent on to\nMrs. J. W. I promised to give it to my brother, and took it home. It was\na dirty looking letter, addressed in an uneducated handwriting, and of ordinary\nbulk. I placed it on the chiumey-piece in our sitting-room, and sat down\nalone. I expected my brother home in an hour or two. The letter, of course,\nin no way interested me. In a minute or two I heard a ticking on the\nchimney-piece, and it struck me that an old-fashioned watch which my mother\nalways had standing in her bedroom must have been brought downstairs. I\nwent to the chimney-piece, but there was no watch or clock there or elsewhere\nin the room. The ticking, which was loud and sharp, seemed to proceed\nfrom the letter itself. Greatly surprised, I removed the letter and put it on\na sideboard, and then in one or two other places ; but the ticking continued,\nproceeding undoubtedly from where the letter was each time. After an hour\nor so of this I could bear the thing no longer, and went out and sat in the\nhall to await my brother. When ho came in I simply took him into the sitting-\nroom and asked him if ho heard anything. He said at once, \" I hear a watch\nor clock ticking.\" There was no watch or clock, as I have said, in the room.\nHe went to where the letter was and exclaimed, \" Why the letter is ticking.\"\nWe then listened to it together, moved it about, and satisfied ourselves that\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 219\nthe ticking proceeded from the letter, which, however, plainly contained\nnothing but a sheet of paper. The impression which the ticking made was\nthat of an urgent call for attention. My brother took the letter to Mrs. J. W.\neither that night (it was very late) or next morning. On opening it, she\nfound that her husband had suddenly died of sunstroke, and the letter was\nwritten by some servant or companion to inform her of his death. The\nticking no doubt made my brother and myself hand on the letter more\npromptly than we might otherwise have done.\nI have never experienced any other hallucination of the senses. I once\nheard a strong push at the street-door at the minute (for I looked at my\nwatch) that my father died at a distance ; but, though I went to the door afc\nonce and saw no one, I cannot, of course, be sure that some passer-by might\nnot have pushed the door and got out of sight ; for the house was in a street\nwith many passers. I have also heard ticks before a death ; but these may\nvery likely have been caused by the death-watch insect ; which certainly was\nnot the case with the ticks which came from the letter. The incident of the\nletter made a deep impression on me.\n(Signed) Anna Davies.\nMr. Davies, brother to Mrs. Davies (who married a gentleman of the\nsame name), gives his independent recollection as follows :\u2014\n(i4, Church-road, Southgate-road, N.\nFebruary 13th, 1889.\nI am afraid my recollection of the details after so long a time has elapsed\nis rather limited and somewhat hazy, so that if my sister has expanded into\ndetails, and her version should slightly differ from mine, please consider that\nI bow to her superior memory, and accept her account as correct. The main\nfeatures of the incident are, however, as nearly as I can recollect, as follow :\u2014\nOne night, it must be nearly, if not quite, 30 years ago, I returned home\nbetween 10 and 11 o'clock, and my sister told me that she had brought home\nfrom the house of a friend of hers a letter from India, addressed to a\nMrs. Walker, who had formerly lived at the house the letter was directed to,\nand being acquainted with Mrs. Walker (whose brother was an intimate\nfriend of mine), I was asked to be the bearer of the letter to her. I found it\non the mantel shelf, and my sister and myself heard very distinctly a clear\nticking noise, as loud as, and similar to, that of a small clock, which we spent\nsome time in trying to account for, and which we could so clearly trace to\nthe vicinity of the letter that it seemed to proceed from the letter itself, but\nwe could find nothing which would in any way account for what we heard. I\ndelivered the letter to my friend the following day to hand to his sister, Mrs.\nWalker, and afterwards heard that it contained the news of the decease of\nher husband in India. I am not quite sure but almost so, that on hearing\nthe mysterious noise we remarked on the probable contents of the letter, but\nwe were certainly struck with the coincidence of the noise being heard whilst\nthe letter was on the shelf (and apparently proceeding from it) and discon\ntinuing on its removal.\nI have no means of fixing the date, or even the year, as Mrs. Walker and\nher brother have both been dead for some years.\nL. A. Davies.\nQ 2\n\f220 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nThe next ease is even more perplexing.\n. G. 212.\nWis., September 22iirf, 1890.\nProf. Wm. James.\nA very unusual thing occurred to the writer and one other person\u2014my\nsister, Miss Mary Q. \u2014at the city of , Wisconsin, on the 5th day of\nNovember, 1885, at 10 o'clock p.m.\nOur mother, Mrs. Mary Margaret Q. R., died at our home, in said city of\n, Wisconsin, on the above date, at 8.40 p.m., very suddenly, of pneumonia.\nOur youngest half-brother, Robert B. R., was working at S , N. Dakota,\nat that time, about 700 miles distant from , Wisconsin. At 9.45 we\nretired to the guests' chamber, a room over the south parlour, and about the\nsams dimensions as said parlour, having two windows to the south and one to\nthe east. There were two beds in this large room, and I lay on one and my\nsister on the other, trying to compose our broken hearts, for we loved our\nmother very dearly. The night was cold and the windows were all closed,\nexcept the east was down at the top a few inches, when, lo ! we both dis\ntinctly heard at the same instant my brother, Robert B. R., singing, \"We\nhad better bide a wee,\" in a clear, deep tenor, accompanied by a high-\npitched soprano and an old-fashioned small melodeon accompaniment, and it\nsounded as though they were up on a level with our windows, about 15 feet\nfrom the ground ; and I arose and threw up the south-west window, from\nwhence the sounds seemed to proceed, and then they\u2014the singing\u2014moved\nto the next, or south-east, window, and sang another verse. And I threw\nthat up and saw nothing, but still distinctly heard the rvords as well as the\nmusic, and so round to the east window, where they sang the last verse, and\nthen the music seemed to float away to the north. But the queer part of\nthis occurrence is the fact that at the very time that we heard my brother\nsinging in , Wisconsin, he teas singing the same song before an audience,\nwith the identical accompaniment, an old, tiny melodeon, and a high-pitched\nsoprano young lady\u2014a Miss E. , of North Dakota\u2014as we learned two days\nafterwards, when he came home in response to our telegram announcing the\ndeath of our mother.\nAny verification of the above facts will be cheerfully made.\n(Signed) [Miss Q.]\n, Wis., October 11th, 1890.\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of the 6th inst. was duly received, and in reply\nto your request for corroborative testimony relative to the \"phenomenal\noccurrence\" on the night of November 5th, 1885, at Janesville, Rock Co.,\nWisconsin\u2014that is, the hearing music and two human voices, and the words\ndistinctly audible\u2014one voice perfectively familiar to us as that of our half-\nbrother, Robert B. R., then of N. Dakota, and the other voice that of a\nstrange lady\u2014soprano, and they, my said brother R. B. R., and Miss Sarah\nE., of N. Dak., were, singing that simc song, \"We had better bide a wee,\"\nat an entertainment given by a church society of S , a printed pro\ngramme of which my brother afterwards sent to us :\u2014\nI am an exceedingly busy person, but a lover of the truth, and interested\nin the progress of the race ; but my sister, Miss Mary Q., of this city, is\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, Ac. 221\nvery conservative and proud, and when I asked her for an affidavit of her\nexperience on that eventful 5th of November, 1885, she replied, \" I do not\nwish the world to think me or you a ' crank ' or Spiritualist, and do not\nwish our names published.\" I will add that my sister, who is blind, is\nrenj intuitive and clairvoyant, and there is much, in her experience to deeply\ninterest the psychical student. It seems to me that the loss of her sight has\nbeen compensated by another sense\u2014a super-intuition.\nI have written to my brother, R. B. R., to reply to your request and\nalso to obtain a programme of the church entertainment at S , N. Dak . , on\nNovember 5th, 1885, at which he and Miss Sarah E. sang \" We had better\nbide a wee,'' and also to state the exact hour when they were called in the\nprogramme, for as Robert stated to us when he arrived on that sad occasion\n\u2014the death of our good mother\u2014he informed us that the telegram was\nbrought to him, and was held by the operator so as not to spoil the entertain\nment by telling him before he sang, and we\u2014my sister Mary Q. and I\u2014both\nheard every note and word of that song sung about seven hundred (700)\nmiles away, while our mother's remains were in the parlour under our\nbedroom . \u2014 Cordially yours,\n(Signed) [Miss Q.'J\nMiss Mary Q.\n, Wis., November 15th, 1890.\nRichard Hodgson, Esq.\nDear Sir,\u2014[In reply to] your kind note of inquiry, relative to my ex\nperiences on the night of November 5th, 1885, they were such as have been\ndescribed by my sister [Miss Q.], who is a lover of scientific research, and is\nnot so timid as I and my brother ; the latter is very much opposed to either\nof us making known our experience on that night, and has urged me not to\ntell anyone of the occurrences of that eventful time, and he refuses to fur\nnish the printed programme of the entertainment, at which he and Miss E.\nwere singing \"We had better bide a wee,\" insisting that people will believe\nus all \"luny\" if we make known all the facts ; and so in deference to his\nprejudices I must respectfully decline to make any further disclosures at\npresent.\u2014Respectfully yours, [Miss Mary Q.]\nPer Amanuensis.\nDecember VMh.\u2014A letter of inquiry sent to Mr. Robert B. \" R.,\" and an\nenvelope, with official stamp of our Society on the cover, has been returned\nto me, unopened, by Mr. Robert B. \"R.,\" so that further corroboration is\nlacking, at least for the present.\u2014R.H.\nIt will be observed that Miss Mary Q.'s letter is virtually a confir\nmation of Miss Q.'s account ; and that Mr. Q.'s action is in harmony\nwith his sister's belief that he cannot deny, but does not wish to\nconfirm, the truth of this singular narrative.\nAre we in this case to assume any agency on the part of the deceased\nmother? Was her mind conscious of the scene at the concert-room,\nand did she transfer it to her daughters ? Or did they become clair-\nvoyantly aware of it ? Or was it flashed upon them from the mind of\nthe telegraph operator, who was the only living person who both knew\nof the death and heard the song ? If we are to press the details of the\n\f222 Mr. F. W. H. MUers.\nstory, we might say that the long continuance, and apparently shifting\nposition, of the phantasmal music indicated not so much an involuntary\nflashing of the scene upon the daughters' minds as a deliberate effort to\nattract their attention.\nLet us pass on to inquire whether the phantom ever shows knowledge\nof events in an earthly friend's life not connected with the decedent's\nown death. Such cases, as already remarked, (Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\n32,) are very rare. Here is one where the decedent, who had been\nstrongly interested in an event which was closely approaching when he\ndied, seems to choose the occasion of that event to manifest his.\ncontinued interest in the friend whom the little crisis\u2014a theatrical\nperformance\u2014closely concerned. It is at least not easy to see any other\nexplanation of the fact that a moment of the percipient's eager excite\nment about a quite different matter was also the moment when the\nphantom took shape before her eyes.\nG. 195. Transitional.\nThe following account of an apparition two days after the death of the\nperson seen was written down by me from the verbal account of the per\ncipient, Miss J., and corrected and signed by her :\u2014\nAmjiot 4th, 1890.\nOn the evening of Saturday, April 26th, 1890, I was engaged with my\nsister and other friends in giving an amateur performance of the Autigone, at\nthe Westminster Town Hall.\nA passage led down to several dressing-rooms used by the ladies who\nwere taking part in the representation, and nowhere else. None of the\npublic had any business down this passage ; although a friend came to the\ndoor of the dressing-room once to speak to some of us.\nI was passing from one dressing-room to another, a few steps further\nalong the passage, just before going on to the stage, when I saw in the\npassage, leaning against the door-post of the dressing-room which I left, a\nMr. H., whom I had met only twice, but whom I knew well by sight, and as\nan acquaintance, though I had heard nothing of him for two years. I held\nout my hand to him, saying, \"Oh, Mr. H., I am so glad to see you.\" In the\nexcitement of the moment it did not occur to me as odd that he should have\ncome thus to the door of the dressing-room,\u2014 although this would have been\nan unlikely thing for a mere acquaintance to do. There was a brilliant light,\nand I did not feel the slightest doubt as to his identity. He was a tall, sin\ngular-looking man, and used to wear a frock-coat buttoned unusually high\nround the throat. I just observed this coat, but noticed nothing else about\nhim specially except his face. He was looking at me with a sad expression.\nWhen I held out my hand he did not take it, but shook his head slowly, with\nout a word, and walked away down the passage\u2014back to the entrance. I did\nnot stop to look at him, or to think over this strange conduct, being in a\ngreat hurry to finish dressing in time.\nNext day, as a number of us were talking over the performance, my sister\ncalled out to me, \" You will be sorry to hear that Mr. H. is dead.\" \"Surely\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 223\nnot,\" I exclaimed, \" for I saw him last night at the Antigone.\" It turned\nout that he had been dead two days when I saw the figure.\nI have never experienced any other hallucination of the senses.\nMiss J.'s sister, Lady M., writes :\u2014\nAugmt 4th, 1890.\nThe day after the performance of the Antigone I heard unexpectedly that\nMr. H. was dead (I had not known that he was ill), and I mentioned the fact\nto my sister, at a party. She seemed greatly astonished, and said that she\nhad seen him at the Antigone the night before. Mr. H. had only met my\nsister twice ; but I happened to know, from a conversation which I had with\nhim, that he had been greatly interested in her. An announcement of the\nperformance of the Antigone was found in a small box of papers which he had\nwith him at his death.\nI think it most unlikely that there should have been any mistake of iden\ntity, as the passage where the figure was seen led only to the dressing-rooms.\nBut in order to satisfy myself on this point, I sent an account of the occur\nrence to the papers. It was widely copied, and I received letters on the\nsubject. If the figure had been some living man, I think that the fact would\nprobably have come out. Mr. H.'s appearance was very peculiar.\nMr. W. S. Lilly, the well-known Roman Catholic author, corroborates as\nfollows :\u2014\nAugmt Mh, 1890.\nI was present at a party when Lady M. suddenly informed her sister,\nMiss J., of the death of Mr. H. I can bear witness to Miss J.'s extreme\nastonishment, and her exclamation, \" Why, I saw him last night at the\nAntigone.\"\nWe have referred to the Times, where the death of Mr. H. is announced\nas having taken place on April 24th, 1890.\nThe account spoken of by Lady M. was sent to the papers within a week\nof the occurrence.\nBut the paucity of apparitions of dead persons at moments when\nevents which would have interested those dead persons are happening\nis noticeable on any view of the phenomena. Those who hold that\nsuch apparitions are always purely subjective, and mainly due to\nexcited expectancy, would look for a special crop of them at these\nemotional moments. And on the other hand those who hold that the\ndead are really engaged in watching over the living would anticipate\nmore frequent indications of their guardianship and care. I am dis\nposed to think that the objection to publicity which stifles so many\nof our best narratives operates here with more than usual strength.\nFor instance, the experience given in Proceedings, VI., p. 26, is one\nwhich many informants less concerned that truth should be known\nwould have entirely suppressed. Another case privately told to mo by\none of the percipients, where an apparition seen by both persons\npresent averted a deed of violence, will certainly never see the light.\n\f224 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nIn the Journal for January, 1891, we have printed a case where a\ndeceased mother is seen, as though floating in the church, at the moment\nof her son's confirmation. The percipient, however, had been well\nacquainted with the deceased lady's aspect, so that there is here no\nevidence of external agency, except the fact that the percipient had\nhad other similar experiences, of which some at least, if not all, seem\ncertainly to have been veridical.\nAnd here we approach the question of so-called \" spirit guardian\nship,\"\u2014the question whether a departed spirit may continue habitually\nin some sense in the neighbourhood of a friend still on earth. Like all\nthe more attractive hypotheses throughout our range of inquiry, this\nhypothesis has suffered from the amount of bad evidence adduced to\nsupport it. It is the favourite commonplace of the fraudulent \"clair\nvoyant medium\"; and, apart from conscious fraud, it is the response\nwhich most often presents itself as the mere reflection of the bereaved\nperson's desire. But worthless evidence does not disprove a theory,\nany more than it proves it ; nor need it greatly surprise us if that\nimpalpable telepathic connection which sometimes seems to be long\nmaintained between two living persons were to persist after the\nremoval of one of them by bodily death. Especially where the decedent\nhas telepathically affected his friend at the hour of death shall we look\nwith interest for any account of a similar influence posthumously\nexercised. In this connection the following case deserves record. The\nwriter, Princess di Cristoforo, who is personally known to me, is the\nwife of Colonel Wickham, of 7, Comeragh-road, W. ; but is of Greek\nand Maltese descent. The names given to the decedents are not the\nreal ones.\nL. 854. Ai1 P\u00bb\nOn the evening of March 13th, 1879, I was dressing myself to go to a\ndinner party at Admiralty House, Vittorioea, Malta. I had accepted Admiral\nand Mrs. 's invitation, much against my will, as a dear friend was lying\nseriously ill at Brighton. However, the latest accounts had been so cheering\nand hopeful that I had allowed myself to be persuaded by my husband into\ngoing. An eerie feeling was creeping over me in an unaccountable manner,\nbut I tried to throw it off and succeeded in doing so to a certain extent ;\nstill, something made me turn my head round and stare into my husband's\ndressing-room, which opened into mine. I distinctly saw a hand waving\nbackwards and forwards twice. I rushed into the room\u2014it was empty.\nSoon afterward, my husband came upstairs, and 1 told him what I had seen,\nbut ho put it down to \"nerves.\" As we crossed the water the cool night\nair seemed to revive me and I began to laugh at myself for letting my\nimagination play such tricks. Arrived at the Admiral's, the same weird feel\ning, that something was near me, crept over me again. I felt sure that if I\nwere to turn round I should see something. All through dinner this idea\nremained fixed in my mind\u2014 and my host, by whom I was seated, teased mo\n\fOn Indications .of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 225\nabout my preoccupation and want of appetite. I was glad when we came\naway ; had the horrible tension continued much longer I must have screamed,\nI think. It was only by the most powerful effort I could assume the sem\nblance of composure. We got home, somehow, and I dragged myself upstairs\nto my room, and commenced undressing. Whilst taking down my hair I\ndistinctly felt a hand pass over my head and neck as if someone was assisting\nme. I told my husband\u2014to be again laughed at. I knelt to say my prayers.\nInstead of praying (as I had been used to do) for God to make my friend\nwell, I, without any will of my own, prayed that he might be taken out of\nhis misery. I went to bed. Something came and lay beside me. I clung to\nmy husband, who tried to calm me, assuring me there was nothing there to\nhurt or frighten me. A cold mouth seemed to freeze on my cheek, and I\ndistinctly heard, \"Good-bye, Sis, good-bye,\" in my friend's well-known\nvoice. Still my husband declared he could hear nothing. I said, \" I am sure\nMr. Abbott is dead.\" My husband said I was hysterical and over-wrought,\ndrew me towards him and held my hand till I fell asleep\u2014for I suppose it\nwas a dream and not a vision I had. Be this as it may, I saw my friend\ncome into my room ; a livid mark was across his face. He was dressed\nin a night-shirt, and his feet were bare. Ho came and sat beside me\u2014\ntold me he was dead\u2014that he had left me some money, and before he died\nhad wished to make some alteration in his bequest, but the end had come so\nsoon, he had not time to do so. He repeated his \"Good-bye,\" kissed me,\nand disappeared.\nI told my husband of my dream and marked the date. Five days after\nwards a letter with a deep black border came to me from my friend's brother,\ntelling me his brother had passed away at 10 o'clock, March 13th. Allowing\nfor the difference of time, Mr. Abbott must have come to me either just\nbefore or just after his death. The legacy left me was as he had stated,\nalso the fact that he had intended to make a change as regarded it, but though\nthe lawyer was sent for, he came too late.\nAw\/xst, 1890.\nColonel Wickham corroborates as follows :\u2014\nCertified to truth of above facts.\u2014G. H. Wickham (Lieut.-Colonel\nlate R.A.).\nL. 865. Ai1 Pn Collective. Visual.\nA friend of mine, an officer in the Gordon Highlanders, was severely\nwounded in the knee at Tel-el-Kebir.\nHis mother was a great friend of mine, and when the ('arthage hospital\nship brought him to Malta she sent me on board to see him and make\narrangements for bringing him on shore. When I got on board I was told\nhis was one of the worst cases there. So badly was my poor friend wounded\nthat it was not considered safe to send him to the Military Hospital, and he,\ntogether with an officer of the Black Watch, was admitted to the naval one.\nBy dint of much entreaty, his mother and I were allowed to go there and\nnurse him. The poor fellow was very ill, and as the doctors considered he\nwould die if an operation was performed, they did not amputate his leg,\nwhich was the only thing that could give him a chance of life. His leg\n\f221i Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nmortified, but the parts sloughed away, and as he still lingered on, some\ntimes better, sometimes worse, the doctors began to think he might, perhaps,\nrecover to a certain degree, though he would be lame for life, and must\neventually die of decline. For nearly three months and a half he lay on his\nVied of agony. About a month before his death the head doctor said that\nthe presence of a lady always near him excited him and retarded his\nrecovery, so I went away to my home on the other side of the harbour, going;\nover frequently to see his mother and learn from her how he was. As he\nwould never take food or medicine, excepting from me, I was troubled to\nthink what the poor boy might do. At last the doctor sent for me, begging\nme to go back, as he was literally dying of starvation, refusing to take food or\nmedicine until I returned. When I went to him he put out his hand to me\nand said : \" They have let you come back to me now that it is too late. I've\ne:iten nothing.\" He lingered about a fortnight after this, and a few days\nbefore the end I pinned the Order of the Osmanli on the front of the poor\ndying boy's night-shirt. It was very cold, and the hospital draughty, my\nlungs were delicate, and I got a fearful cough and kind of fever from the\nimpure air of the room, for I sit in an armchair by his bed all night, as he\nslept butter holding my hand.\nOne night, January 4th, 1880, no immediate change being apprehended,\nhis mother made me go home to have a night's rest, as I was by this time\nvery ill indeed, not being strong at the best of times. He had been in a\nkind of lethargy for some hours, and as the doctor said he would probably\nsleep, being under the effects of morphia, until the next morning, I con\nsented to go, intending to return at daybreak, so that ho should find me\nthere when he awoke. About three o'clock that night my eldest son, who\nwas sleeping in my room, woke me with the cry of : \" Mamma ! there is\nMr. Blake!\" I started up ! It was quite true. He floated through the room\nabout half a foot from the floor, smiling at me as he disappeared through the\nwindow. He was in his night-dress, but, strange to say, his foot, of which\nthe toes had dropped off from mortification, wm exactly like the other one.\nWe (both my son and myself) noticed this. Half an hour afterwards a man\ncame to tell me that Mr. Blake had died at U o'clock, and I must go to his\nmother, who had sent for me. She told me that he had been half consciousjust\nbefore he died, and was feeling about for my hand, after pressing hers and\nthat of his soldier-servant who had remained with him to the last. I have\nnever forgiven myself for going home that night.\nThe writer's son, who was, as she informs us, nine years old at\nthe time of the occurrence, signs the account as follows :\u2014\nI certify to the above fact.\u2014Edmund Wickham.\nO. 640. Collective. Visual and tactile.\nAugust, 1890.\nIn the summer of 1880 I was living at Stuttgart, having taken my family\nthere for educational reasons. We were all seated at the tea-table, talking\nand laughing, when I felt an extraordinary sensation as if someone was\nleaning heavily on my shoulders. I tried to turn round but literally couldn't\ndo so. My head was stroked, and my cup, which was full, was lifted up, and\nput down half empty. Looking across the table I found my daughter's eyes\n\fOn Indications of Continued Tet~rene Knowledge, ctc. 227\nfixed, and staring with a scared look in them I never wish to see again, at\nthe back of where I sat. I said nothing at the time, but when we were\nalone together in the drawing-room I asked L. what had made her stare at, or\nrather beyond, me so.\n\" I saw Mr. Abbott and Mr. Blake standing, one on either side of you ;\nthey had one of their hands on each of your shoulders, and they changed\nplaces once,\" replied L.\n\" How were they dressed ? \" I asked.\n\" Mr. Abbott was in his grey suit ; Mr. Blake in Highland uniform.\"\n\" Did either of them drink out of my cup ?\" I asked.\n\" I don't know. My head was fixed as if in a photographer's rest, and I\ncould not take my eyes off their faces.\"\n\" Were they sad-looking ? \"\n\" No ! They were both smiling down at you. I could not see lower than\ntheir waists clearly ; there seemed to be a kind of haze, but their faces were\nquite clear.\"\nBoth these young men had appeared to me previously\u2014at the time of\ntheir deaths. [See two previous accounts.] They were much attached to\nme, and very fond of my little daughter. When first meeting these two men\nthey both told me they had seen me before\u2014that I was in the habit of sitting\nin a chair by their bedside and staring at them.\nMiss Wickham has given to me, verbally and in writing, a com\npletely concordant account.\nThe Princess di Cristoforo believes that the same two figures have\nsince been described to her by a clairvoyante.\nIf the departed thus watch their friends on earth, it is possible that\nthey may acquire some retrospective or prospective insight into the\nevents of those friends' lives. They may, for instance, discern the\napproach of death before that pnignosis is clear to an earthly physician.\nA narrative of this type reaches us from America.\nG. 213\nJanuary 28th, 18'Jl.\nAbout eleven years ago I was much distressed owing to the illness of my\nwife, who suffered from cancer in the stomach. I heard about a medium,\nMiss Susie Nickerson White, who was said to have given some remarkable\ntests, and I called on her as a stranger and requested a sitting. My wife's\nsister purported to \" control,\" giving her name, Maria, and mentioning facts\nabout my family which were correct. She also called my wife by her name,\nEliza Anne, described her sickness, and said that she would pass over, but\nnot for some months. I said, \" What do you call this ? Is it psychology, or\nmesmerism, or what 1 \" Maria said, \" I knew you were going to ask that ;\nI saw it in your mind.\" I said, \"Do you get all the things out of my\nmind V She replied, \" No. I'll tell you some things that are not in your\nmind. Within three days Eliza Anne will say that she has seen mo and\nmother, too, if I can get mother to come along.\" (My wife's mother had died\n\f228 Mi: F. W. H. Myers.\nabout forty-five years previously, and my wife's sister had been dead from\nsix to eight years.)\nI kept these circumstances to myself, but within three days the nurse\nwho was in attendance upon my wife came running to me and said that my\nwife was worse, and was going out of her mind ; that she had called upon\nMaria and mother, and had sprung out of bed and ran towards the door,\ncrying, \" Stop, Maria ! Stop, mother ! Don't go yet !\"\nI soon consulted Miss White again, and Maria again purported to control,\nMy wife had been unable for some days to retain any food in her stomach,\ncould not keep even water or milk, and was very weak and also unable to\nsleep.\nMaria told me to give her some hot, very strong coffee, with plenty of\ncream and sugar and some cream toast. This prescription amazed me, but it\nwas prepared. My wife ate and drank with relish, and slept soundly after\nwards. She lived upon this food for some days, but gradually became unable\neven to take this.\nI consulted Miss White again, and Maria told me to get some limes, and\nto give my wife some pure juice of the lime several times a day ; she said\nthat this would give her an appetite and enable her to retain food. The\nprescription was a success ; but gradually my wife failed, and I consulted\nMiss White again, and asked Maria how long my wife would continue to\nsuffer. She said she could not tell exactly when she would pass away, but\nwould give me a warning\u2014 ''The next time she says she has seen me,\ndon't leave her afterwards.\"\nSome days later, as I was relieving the nurse about three or four in the\nmorning, the nurse said, \" Mammie \" (meaning my wife) \"says she has seen\nMaria again.\" In a few minutes my wife said, \"I must go.\" And she\nexpired.\n(Signed) E. Pahie, Mary A. Paige.\n[Formerly Mary A. Dockerty, the nurse.]\n[I have had long interviews with Mr. Paige. He seems to be a shrewd\nand careful witness.\u2014Richard Hodgson.]\nTo this may be added a French incident,\u2014carefully observed, but in\nitself not conclusive evidence for more than telepathy between living\nminds.\nG. 214.\nIn Annnles Psychiques, Part II. (March-April, 1891), p. 98, a case is given\nwhich presents some analogy to these. The case is a recent one, and it\noccurred among the immediate friends of M. Richet ; but, as will bo seen, the\napparitions were very indistinct. There was a coincidence of two dreams or\n\" borderland \" impressions, as follows : \u2014\n1. Scaur Marthe, attending on the dying M. Bastiau, dreams with great\nvividness that an unrecognised female figure, with the voice of Mme. Bastian,\ndead some eight months previously, approaches the bedside of Cecile, daughter\nof Mme. B. (asleep in the same room with Sueur Marthe), takes her hand, and\nsays, \"Kile est gentille, Cecile.\"\n2. On the same night, and at about the same time, Mme, M. Houdaille,\ndaughter of M. Bastian. lying in bed between sleep and waking, saw a white\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 229\nfigure standing beside her bed, which so alarmed her that she shrieked aloud.\nHer brother, alarmed by the shriek, rushed into her room and found her with\na terrified expression.\nThese dreams or impressions were independently noted.\nThey occurred March 6th, 1891. M. Bastian died March 13th.\nOn the analogy of the cases given above, it is conceivable that the figure\nrepresented Mme. Bastian, and that its appearance was induced by the\napproaching end of M. Bastian.\nThis view, however, is obviously incapable of proof in this case.\nTwo other American cases may be added to this small group.\nG. 215.\nFrom Mrs. Wilson, through Prof. \\V. C. Crosby, Associate member,\nS.P.R.\nMrs. Caroline Rogers, 72 years old, a widow who had been twice married,\nand whose first husband, a Mr. Tisdale, died about 35 years ago, has lived on\nAshland-street, in Roslindale, Mass., for the last 25 years ; and since the\ndeath of her last child, some years ago, she has lived quite alone. Early in\nMarch of this year she was stricken with paralysis, and after an illness of\nnearly six weeks died on the afternoon of Tuesday, April 15th.\nMrs. Mary Wilson, a professional nurse, forty-five years old, attended Mrs.\nRogers during her illness, remaining with her almost constantly until she\ndied. She had never seen Mrs. Rogers before the latter's illness, and knew\nnothing of her family or history. Mrs. Rogers spoke frequently to Mrs.\nWilson, and also to others, as had long been her custom, of her second\nhusband, Mr. Rogers, and her children, expressing a desire to see them\nagain, &c.\nOn the afternoon of April 14th Mrs. Rogers became unconscious, and\nremained so all the time until her death twenty-four hours later. Mrs. Wilson\nsat up with her through the whole of Monday night. Mrs. Wilson's daughter\nIda, twenty-five years old, kept her mother company, and a boy of ten or twelve\nyears slept in an adjoining chamber, to be called in case of an emergency.\nThese four were the only persons in the house. The outer doors were\nsecurely locked, the door leading from the sick chamber, on the second floor,\ninto the hall was kept locked all the time, because it was near the foot of\nMrs. Rogers' bed ; and entrance to the sick chamber was gained by passing\nfrom the upper hall into the living-room by a door which was locked that\nnight, and thence through the chamber in which the boy slept ; the two\nchambers having been made to communicate by cutting a door through the\nback of a small closet. This door was diagonally facing the bed on which\nMrs. Rogers lay. Mrs. Wilson rested on a settee placed at right angles to\nthe head of Mrs. R.'s bed, so that when lying down her face was almost\ndirectly opposite this door and not more than ten or twelve feet from it.\nThe lamp, which burned brightly all night, stood on a small table in the\ncorner of the room directly opposite the door ; and Ida occupied a couch\nagainst the wall and between the lamp and door.\n\f230 Mr. F.

He was middle-sized, broad-\nshouldered, with shoulders thrown back, had a florid complexion, reddish-\nbrown hair (bare headed) and beard, and wore a brown sack overcoat, which\nwas unbuttoned. His expression was grave, neither stern nor pleasant, and\nhe seemed to look straight at Mrs. Wilson, and then at Mrs. Rogers without\nmoving. Mrs. Wilson supposed, of course, that it was a real man, and tried\nto think how he could have got into the house. Then, as he remained quite\nmotionless, she began to realise that it was something uncanny, and becoming\nfrightened, turned her head away and called her daughter, who was still\nasleep on the couch, awakening her. On looking back at the door after an\ninterval of a minute or two, the apparition had disappeared ; both its coming\nand going wore noiseless, and Mrs. Rogers remained perfectly quiet, and so\nfar as could be known entirely unconscious during this time. The chamber\ninto which this door leads being quite dark, there was no opportunity to\nobserve whether or not the apparition was transparent. Mrs. Wilson shortly\nafterwards went into this chamber and the living-room, but did not examine\n\fOn Indications of Contin ued Terrene Knowledge, iLc. 231\nthe lower part of the house until morning, when the doors were found pro\nperly locked and everything all right.\nIn the morning Mrs. Rogers' niece, Mrs. Hildreth, who lives in the\nneighbourhood, and has known Mrs. R. and her family for many years,\ncalled at the house. Mrs. Wilson related her experience to her and asked if\nthe apparition resembled Mr. Rogers, and Mrs. Hildreth replied emphatically\nthat it did not. (All who knew Mr. Rogers are agreed on this point.) Their\nconversation was interrupted then, but when resumed later in the day Mrs.\nHildreth said that Mrs. Wilson's description agreed exactly with Mr. Tisdale,\nMrs. Rogers' first husband. Mrs. Rogers came to Roslindale after marrying\nMr. Rogers, and Mrs. Hildreth is the only person in that vicinity who ever\nsaw Mr. Tisdale ; and in Mrs. Rogers' house there is no portrait of him nor\nanything suggestive of his personal appearance. Mrs. Wilson is also very\npositive that the apparition was unlike anyone she ever knew.\nMrs. Wilson has had similar experiences before, and at least one, which\noccurred when she was 18 years old, which appears to have been veridical.\nThe foregoing account of my experience is correct in every particular.\nMary Wilson.\nThe foregoing is a full and accurate statement of Mrs. Wilson's experience\nas she related it to me on the morning of April 15th.\nF.

A few days before she died she said to me,\n\" I am going to die,\" and asked me to take care of her baby, which I did\nuntil it died three months after. The night before she died we were awakened\nbetween twelve and one o'clock by a noise like tapping at the window\ntwice. My husband got up and went downstairs, but could see nothing. So\nwe tried to settle to sleep again, when all of a sudden we were alarmed by\nour little boy, who was not quite two years old, calling out \"Auntie,\" by\nwhich name he used to call her, and pointing towards the foot of the bed,\nand there I saw her standing all in white. She died the next morning\n(Thursday) between nine and ten. She appeared again a second time three\nmonths later ; it would be about midnight. My husband saw her standing\nby the fire. At first he thought it was I, until he turned round and saw I\nwas in bed. We were very much frightened for a long time after. The\nbaby died the next day about three o'clock in the afternoon (Thursday).\nThey both died on the Thursday to the best of our knowledge. And it was\non the Sunday when they were both buried. We can't recollect the exact day\n\f232 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nof the month, as they had no cards printed for either. The mother died in\nNovember, 1877, the baby in February, 1878.

Suppose, for instance, that a\nmother loses her son at a distance ; and while that son is dying sees\nhim in a dream accompanied by his long-dead father. Here, consider\ning the symbolical character of the details in many of these veridical\ndreams, we have no right to assume that the father's figure is itself\nmore than a symbol. On the other hand, it is, of course, conceivable\nthat the father may be welcoming the son in some other world, and\nthat both may be able to appear together to the surviving wife and\nmother.\nThe case which follows is interesting, as showing that a monition of\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 233\ndeath which at first appears of simple type may in reality be based\nupon a background of symbolism involving the possible action of a\ndeceased relative.\nA young German lady, whom I will call Friiulein A., known to me\nas governess in the house of friends, sent to me in January, 1892, a\nstatement which I here translate.\nG. 216.\n\"On November 23rd, 1890, while I held my [previous] situation as\ngoverness at H., I was awakened at half-past six by a strong smell of death.\nBefore awakening I had had a vision of the corpse of my brother Carl, who\nwas at that time at Zurich. Alarmed by this strange dream, I sent a\ntelegram to Zurich, in which I said that I would return home if my brother\nwere dangerously ill. [In a further letter Friiulein A. explains that\nNovember 23rd was a Sunday, and that her pupil's lessons prevented her\nfrom telegraphing till the afternoon of November 24th ; as she did not like\nto mention her wish to send a telegram merely because of a dream.} I\nreceived a telegraphic reply which advised me to remain where I was. Two\ndays later I received from my relations the news of the death of my brother\nCarl, which had taken place at 6 a.m. on November 23rd, 1890.\"\nThe date of the death is confirmed by a \" Todtenschein \" sent to\nFriiulein A. from the Civilstandbeamte of the Civilstandskreis in which the\ndeath occurred. Friiulein A. has kindly presented us with this certificate.\nThe fact of the receipt of Fraulein A.'s telegram is testified to by Fraulein\nPauline Tobler, who writes as follows from Zcirich, February 12th, 1892 :\u2014\nThe undersigned bears witness that between herself and Fraulein [A.],\nthen in Helensburgh, on November 24th, 1890, at 6 p.m. a telegram and\nreply passed as follows: \u2014\"Wenn Carl gefahrlich erkrankt, komm nach\nHause. Antwort.\" \" Conseille rester.\" Patjlink Tobler.\nWe learn from the General Post Office, Edinburgh, that the forms of\nforeign telegrams are preserved for six months only. Nor has the Zurich\npost-office preserved a copy. We cannot, therefore, produce the original de\nspatch. It is obvious, however, from Fraulein Tobler's evidence, that Friiulein\nA. telegraphed while unaware of her brother's death. Thus far, then, the case\nappeared to be a well-attested dream of death, promptly acted upon, but\nwith no unusual features. In conversation with Fraulein A. , however, I found\nthat she regarded the incident in a different light ; as forming one of a\nseries of instances in which her departed mother had informed her of events\nclosely concerning her. One of these instances was too private for publica\ntion ; the rest Fraulein A. records as follows :\u2014\n\"On May 31st, 1887, my dear mother died. I had nursed her during\nher illness ; and before her death I begged her to send me some intimation\nif anything of importance were to happen in our family. She promised me\nto do this, so far as might be possible to her.\n\"In December, 1889, I left Switzerland, and went to London, and thence\ntook a temporary engagement as governess near Welwyn. In February,\n1890, my mother appeared to me in a dream. She held in her hand three\nsmall nosegays, each of them consisting of a bunch of green leaves and a\nprimrose ; and signed to me to choose one of them. I stretched out ni'y\nR\n\f234 Mr, F. W. H, Myers.\nhand to the middle one. Before I had grasped it, the flower fell. My\nmother pointed to the fallen flower, and turned sadly away. The dream\nimpressed me strangely, as I had three brothers, of whom the middle one\nhad been specially recommended to my care by my dying mother. I inquired\nat once after his health ; but he was quite well.\n\"In the following June, 1890, I saw my mother again in a dream, as\nthough on her deathbed. This dream was repeated. After the second\ndream I woke, and again slept and dreamt. This time I saw my brother,\nalready mentioned ; his cheeks red with fever. Alarmed by this dream I\nwrote home next day, but could hear of nothing unusual. I was reassured ;\nand dreamt no more until some months later I dreamt of my brother as dead.\nIt was only after his death that I learnt that at the time when I dreamt of\nhim as in a fever he actually had influenza. He recovered ; but died some\nmonths later from a second attack.\n\"These were the only dreams which have ever left a deep and permanent\nimpression upon me\u2014the only dreams upon which I have ever acted.\"\nIt is, of course, conceivable that the mother's figure seen in dream\nmay have been merely a symbolic form assumed by a telepathic message\nfrom the still living brother. On the other hand, we have the mother's\ndying promise to bring just such messages, if possible, from her new\nworld.i\nIn Fraulein A.'s case the intimations, as will have been observed,\nare wordlessly conveyed, and so it is with the majority of these visions.\ni I add in a note a case where the apparition conveys information which leads to\nimportant results ; in the hope that the publication of the narrative, which is now\nobtainable only at second hand, may lead to the improvement of the evidence. We\nhave the real names ; the transmitter of the case, Mrs. Bodington, n medical prac\ntitioner at Matsqui, British Columbia, and author of a book of lectures on Evolu\ntion, is known to us by correspondence as a painstaking informant.\nG, 222.\nI was residing in the year 1809 in the family of a retired naval officer and his\nwife, two miles from a seaport town. The wife, whom I will call Mrs. R., was what is.\nusually understood as a highly domesticated person ; to the last degree unimaginative ;\nrarely opening a book, and indifferent to everything except household concerns and\nthe care of her children.\nOne afternoon, in the month of September, the conversation happened to turn\nupon the subject of the often recorded appearances of dying persons to their friends\nat the moment of death. [After some talk] Mrs. R and her husband looked at each\nother and seemed as if hesitating about speaking. After a pause, Mrs. R. said : \" If\nyou do not laugh at the very idea of the possible appearance of the dead, I should like.\n\u20aco tell you of something that happened to myself. When I was engaged to my\nhusband I was living with my brother, who was British Consul at Cadiz. [Captain\nR, was a widower; his first wife, with whom he had not lived happily, having died\nsome eight months previously, leaving a young infant. Mrs. R. had never seen or\nknown the first wife, and was not in England at the time of her death.] After out\nmarriage we returned to England, and my husband's first care was to find the nurse\nwith whom his youngest child had been left. To his great grief, the woman had left\nP., and had removed to some other part of England, taking the baby with her. Soon\nafter this vain search for the baby we went up to London, and took lodgings for a\ntime. The bedroom in these lodgings was entered from the sitting-room, and there\nWas no other means of getting in or out. One night I could not go to sleep ; the fire\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 235\nSometimes, as in the narrative next to be cited, there is a record of\nprolonged speech, but in such cases, especially when few or no actual\nwords are quoted, we can hardly be sure as to the degree of externali-\nsation which the voice assumes. The apparition here seems to have at\nleast comprehended the percipient's inward situation, although it is not\nclear that any prediction requiring supernormal insight was actually\nmade. I owe the narrative to the kindness of Mr. Morell Theobald,\nwho printed it first in Light for March 5th, 1892. It is written on an\nold piece of paper (sent to me) and marked \" For Mr. B.'s private\nperusal.\" The history of the paper is as follows :\u2014A Mr. C. (I must\nnot give the names), well known to Mr. Theobald, and holding a good\nposition in one of the Australian colonies, discovered it among the\nprivate papers of his uncle, Mr. B., who died twelve years ago. The\napparition, as will be seen, occurred on October 24th, 1860, and the\naccount is endorsed November 9th by the percipient's father. Further\nparticulars, sent to Mr. B. by the percipient, are dated November 13th,\n1860. The first account seems to have been sent by the percipient to\nhis father, and by the father to Mr. B.\nThe percipient has been identified, and confirms, as will be seen,\nthis early narrative. It is interesting to find a contemporaneous record\nof a case of this now familiar type, written down at a time when less\nattention had been directed to these messages from departing or\ndeparted friends.\nwas burning brightly in the sitting-room, and the door was partly open. I had a\nconsciousness that there was someone in the next room. I saw the door gently pushed\nback, and a beautiful lady came in, followed by a common looking woman, carrying\na child about a year old, dressed in a yellow pelisse. The lady came up to the side of\nthe bed, and said, pointing to the baby, ' This is Johnny ; you will remember\nJohnny.' She smiled at me, and I was just going to answer, when the whole vision\nwas gone. I did not feel the least afraid, and I even turned to see where the\nbeautiful lady with the child and nurse had gone to. Then it suddenly struck me that\nthese were not real people, and I woke my husband and described what I had seen.\nHe said, ' I do not know what to think, but you have exactly described my first wife.'\nThe lost child's name was Johnnie. Well, we tried to think the incident had been\nan ordinary dream, and some days elapsed, when we chanced to lose ourselves in\nreturning from Westminster Abbey in one of the low streets of that neighbourhood.\nSuddenly I saw coming down the street the common-looking woman I had seen in\nthe vision, carrying the baby with the yellow pelisse. I said to my husband, ' That\nis the woman I saw.' He warned me to be careful, and as the woman approached, he\nsaid to her, 'That is a nice little boy you have got there.' ' Yes, sir,' she said, ' he\nis a nice little boy. But I wish I could find them as owns him. His father is an\nofficer in the navy, and I doubt whether his ship is back yet.' We made further\ninquiries, and we found the woman was really the one with whom my husband's wife's\nrelations had placed the baby. We took the baby home, and he grew up and went into\nthe navy when he was old enough, and it is for him that I am now in mourning.\"\nThis was the story as told by Mrs. R., and so great was the impression made upon my\nmind that I am certain of remembering all the details, if not always the precise\nwords. But these words I do remember precisely, \" This is Johnny ; you will remember\nJohnny.\"\nAlice BoDisaToy.\nr 2\n\f236 t v. Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nG. 217,\n\" On the evening of Wednesday, October 24th, 1860, having retired to bed\nabout nine o'clock, I had slept, I conclude, about two hours, making it then\nabout eleven o'clock p.m. I was awoke from my sleep by a hand touching\nmy forehead, and the well-known voice of Mrs. B. pronouncing my name, E.\nI started up, and sat in bed, rubbed my eyes, and then saw Mrs. B. From\nthe head to the waist the figure was distinct, clear, and well-defined : but\nfrom the waist downwards it was all misty and the lower part transparent.\nShe appeared to be dressed in black silk. Her countenance was grave and\nrather sad, but not unhappy.\n\"The words she first uttered were: 'I have left dear John'; what\nfollowed related entirely to myself, and she was permitted by a most\nkind Providence to speak words of mercy, promise, and comfort, and\nassurance that what I most wished would come to pass. She came to me\nin an hour of bitter mental agony, and was sent as a messenger of mercy.\n\"I would have spoken more to her, but the form faded, and in answer\nto an earnest appeal, a voice came to me which, though apparently hundreds\nof miles away, was distinct and clear, saying, ' Only believe,' and she was\ngone.\n'' Throughout the interview I felt no fear, but an inward, heavenly\npeace. It was new moon, but the room was as light as day ! \"\nOur next information consists of a statement of Mr. D.'s (so to term the\npercipient, a gentleman of position), written in reply to Mr. B.'s questions,\nNovember 13th, 1860 ; found (in Mr. B.'s handwriting) among Mr. B.'s\npapers, and now summarised for us by Mr. C.\n\"Mr. D. had been asleep but could not say how long. Had not seen\nMrs. B. for several months. Can't recollect what dress she had on then.\nWas not in bad health. Was alone in the house. The subject of his anxiety\nwas not known to Mrs. B. nor connected with her. The apparition seemed\nto wait for questions, and when put they were answered. The subject of\nthe communication was one greatly influencing his thoughts and feelings,\nand had been deeply agitating him before he went to bed. It was not a\nreligious matter ; but Scriptural language was used ; Mark xi. 23, 24 were\nquoted ;\u2014a passage well known to the writer, and often dwelt upon by him.\nThe window faces north. The night was wet and cloudy. The writer did\nnot put it down at the time, believing it too real ever to be forgotten. He\nhad not mentioned it to anyone but his father and Mrs. B. He saw the\nnotice of the death for the first time on Saturday in the Observer. Resided\nabout 10 miles from Gawler, which is 25 miles from Adelaide.\"\nMr. C. has forwarded to us a printed extract from the South Australian\nBegister of October 25th, 1860, which includes a notice of the death of Mrs.\nB. on October 24th, at Bank-street, Adelaide. The hour of the death is\nfixed by Mr. C.'s own recollection, depending on his own fixed habits\nat the time. He writes to Mr. Theobald, under date May 3rd, 1892 :\u2014\n\"I was at that time a clerk in my uncle's office, which was at his house in\nBank-street, Adelaide ; but was staying just then at Glenelly. I left the\noffice at 4 p.m. on the 23rd after saying good-bye to Mrs. B. , leaving her in her\nusual state of health. She was taken ill about 11 p.m., and asked frequently\nfor me, expressing a strong desire not to die before I arrived ; but when I\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knmvledge, &c. 237\ngot to the hoiise at the usual time, about 10 a.m., next morning, I was met\nwith the news that she had been dead about two hours.\"\nThe death, therefore, had taken place more than twelve hours before the\napparition was seen.\nMr. D. makes a slight mistake in his original account, in saying that it\nwas new moon, whereas the moon was then ten days old. But as it was a\ncloudy night, and his window faced north, the light by which the figure was\nseen was doubtless, as in so many of these cases, itself a part of the\napparition.\nAt Mr. Theobald's request Mr. C. communicated with Mr. D., who is\nstill living ; and we have therefore the opportunity of comparing a thirty\nyears' old recollection with the same person's contemporary statement. The\ncomparison shows that,\u2014as I believe to be often the case,\u2014the memory of\nthe supernormal incident had not grown, but dwindled.\nReminded in a general way, but without detail, of the occurrence, Mr.\nD. writes (in a letter seen by me), April 21st, 1892 :\u2014\n\"There was no conversation. She only said to me, 'E., I have loft\ndear John.' I cannot remember whether it was wet or not ; but as to the\nmoon, it was not at all like that light. It was more like an electric light ;\u2014\na subdued brilliancy. . . . 'How long did the spirit remain in\nconversation with me ? ' Certainly not more than 5 minutes, if so\nlong. ... I sent the account to my father, who probably handed it to\nMrs. B.\"\nFurther reminded of his contemporary account, Mr. D. writes, May 1st,\n1892 :\u2014\" I appear to have spoken, but have no distinct recollection of doing\nso. What she did say was entirely personal.\" It related to the removal of\na painful misunderstanding with a friend. ' ' So far as I know she had never\nseen, or even heard, of the friend alluded to.\" Mr. D. declines to give\nfurther detail; but he still considers that the communication showed \"a\nplenary knowledge \" of facts personal to himself. His hesitation of memory\nseems to have been on the point whether the hope and consolation were\nconveyed by spoken words, or in some directer fashion. The confidence\ninspired by the message was, he tells us, justified by the result.\nThe supposed conversation in this case may have been more dream\nlike than the percipient supposed. It may have taken place, so to say,\nin his own mind, without definite auditory externalisation.\nWe may, indeed, expect to find various transitional forms between\nthe visual phantom and the more strictly automatic message ;\u2014between\nthe hallucinatory image of the departed friend and the words uttered\nin trance, or given by writing or table-tilting, which claim to originate\nin his intelligence. The manifestations are fundamentally of the same\norder, but with this advantage on the part of the motor messages, that\nthey employ a physical faculty of the automatist's which can be easily\nexercised for a long time continuously ; whereas the faculty needed\nto see or hear a phantasmal figure or voice seems liable to rapid\nexhaustion.\nI will conclude this paper, as I concluded my \" Defence of\n\f23S Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nPhantasms of the Dead,\" in Vol. VI., with a group of messages of\nthe motor type\u2014messages given through automatic writing or other\nvarieties of automatic movement. Such messages have perplexities of\ntheir own,\u2014perplexities discussed in other papers, and to which I can\nnot here return. But with all the doubts as to their true origin these\nwritten messages seem to me to form our most hopeful approach to the\nexact knowledge which we desire. A single form of repeatable experi\nment,\u2014even if that experiment succeed but once in a thousand times,\n\u2014is basis enough for generations of research.\nI will give three cases, presenting different points of interest. In\nthe first we have a message containing a fact perhaps known to the de\nceased person from whom the message purported to come ; and certainly\nnot \" consciously \"\u2014that is, supraliminally\u2014known to the automatists\nwho received it. If, however, we assume the existence of any sub\nliminal clairvoyance on the part of those living persons,\u2014or even,\nperhaps, of a degree of perspicacity exceeding that possessed by their\nnormal selves,\u2014we might explain the message as having originated in\ntheir own minds.\nIn the second case we have a series of automatic messages,\u2014some\nof them, perhaps, explicable on the lines just now suggested ; some of\nthem possibly to be explained by telepathy from living minds, some of\nthem, on the other hand, at least primd facie referable to the source in\nthe mind of a departed person, from which they professed to come.\nWhether there are in reality so many different origins of a series of\nmessages given to one automatist, or whether any one explanation can\nba made to cover them all, is a matter to which we shall elsewhere have\nto return.\nThe third case narrates the success of a direct experiment,\u2014a test-\nmessage planned before death and communicated after death, by a man\nwho held that the hope of an assurance of continued presence was worth\nat least a resolute effort, whatever its result might be.\nG. 218.\n345, W. 34th-street, New York, October 3rd, 1888.\nDr. Richard Hodgson.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014Thinking that you may possibly be back from your\nvacation, I send you with this the account of the finding of the note by Mrs.\nB. and the letter to me from Dr. Knorr.\n(Signed) W. D. Harden.\nSavannah, Ga., September 16th, 1888.\nJudge W. D. Harden,\n345, W. 34th-street, New York.\nDear Friend,\u2014This morning, when I paid a professional visit to Mrs.\nB.'s sick son, she showed me a rough draught of the statement she intended\nto send to you. Fearing further delay from her intended re-writing report, I\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, ,Scc. 239\nbegged her to let me have it. She consented, if I would explain to you the\ncircumstances of the shortcomings of that draught.\nI think I need to add very little to Mrs. B.'s statements. You are\nacquainted with the modus operandi of the communications with the sliding\nrod, the rod and the alphabet board being at B.'s house, the same you saw at\nMiss Maggie R.'s. In order to facilitate your description for Dr. H. I send\nyou a paper model of the rod and a printed alphabet (with other convenient\ninscriptions), that is to be pasted near the two (right and left) edges, leaving a\nspace between of sufficient width for the points of the rod to point out the\ndesired letters.\nI have to remark that a couple of days after the death of Miss Nina B.'s\nfiance' (Mr. N. H.) I assisted her to get into communication with him. We\nsucceeded, Miss Nina turning out to be feebly mediumistic, and many com\nmunications were received from him.\nThis attracted Major B.'s attention. He tried then with me (the major\nwas then an Agnostic), and found that he also was mediumistic, and he got\ncommunications from his father and his uncle that were so characteristic that\nho became convinced of the reality of spirit communion. So when the major\ndeparted, last spring or summer, he was well acquainted with the modus\noperandi of spirit communion ; and therefore the very day after his departure\nwe could receive a few words from him. Later on we received many messages\nfrom him.\nI think I was present at the seance when he stated that the note was\ndeposited somewhere, but could not tell where. It looks as if at that time\nhe had not yet discovered the whereabouts of the note, but continued hunting\nfor it, and at last discovered it.\nI think I have touched upon every point that needed elucidation.\nL. Kkoer, Savannah.\nJudge Harden.\nIn compliance with your request I will state : After my honoured\nhusband Major Lucius B.'s departure from this life, I was in distress of\nmind that none could understand but one surrounded by similar circum\nstances. Of his business transactions I knew but little. After a week or\ntwo of stunning agony, I aroused myself to look into our financial condition.\nI was aware that he had in his keeping a note given by Judge H. W.\nHopkins to some several hundred which was due, and I searched all the\nnooks and corners of his secretaire, manuscript, letters, memorandum-books,\nro w! several hundred letters ; but all for naught. For two months I spent\nmost of the time going over and over, but with the same result. I finally\nasked him at a seance about the note.\nQ. : \" Have you deposited the note anywhere ? \" A.: \" I have.\"\nQ. : \" Where ? \" No answer.\nFinally I wrote to Judge H. (who had written me about it) : \"I had as\nwell tell you the note has not been found. I cannot imagine where it is.\"\nThis was on Friday. The following Sunday, about four o'clock, my daughter\nNina, who possesses some singular power, proposed we try if we could not\nget a communication from our loved ones. While she went to get a little\narrangement (a rod that worked on a board upon which the letters of the\nalphabet were printed) I sat in my room alone, thinking, if it were possible\n\f240 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfor Major B. to see the heart filled to overflowing with anguish, and added to\nthis the mind distressed by business cares, would he not communicate with\nme and try to give some consolation or assistance.\nBut I did not express my thoughts to anyone. Nina returned, and after\na little conversation we put our hands on the rod and it promptly spelt\n\" Look in my long drawer and find Willie.\" I became excited, ran to the\nbureau and pulled out the bottom drawer, turned the contents upon the\nfloor, and commenced to search. Under all the things was a vest ; in its\nlittle breast pocket was the note.\nMajor B. was in the habit of calling the bottom drawer, where only his\nunder-garments were kept, \" My long drawer,\" to designate it from several\nsmall drawers set aside for his use. The vest was the only garment, other\nthan underwear, in the drawer. The vest was the one taken off him when\nhe first became ill. He was unconscious during the first day of his illness.\nThe vest was put in the drawer after or during his illness by my friend, I\nthink, who assisted in caring for him while sick.\nThe drawer had not been opened that we knew of after he left us until\nthe note was discovered. Although I had moved to another room, I gave\ninstructions that the bottom drawer was not to be disturbed.\nAs soon as the rod spelt \" Look in my long drawer and find Willie \" I\nwas perfectly electrified with the knowledge that Willie H.'s note was\nin that drawer, although I never would have thought of looking in such a\nplace for a valuable paper.\nMajor B. and myself always spoke to and of Judge H. as \" Willie,\" he\nbeing a relation of mine and a favourite of Major B. from Willie's childhood.\nI have just read the above to my daughter, and she says she will endorse\nthe statement as being correct.\u2014I am, very respectfully,\n(Signed) Mrs. E. F. B. B., widow of the\nlate Major Lucius C. B.\n(Signed) N. H. B.\nSavannah, Ga., September 16th, 1888.\nThe two signatures have been made in my presence, and I corroborate\nmany of the facts and circumstances mentioned in the above report. I am\nnow requested by the ladies to say that they do not wish their names to\nappear in public. (Signed) Louis Knorr, M.D.\nSavannah, October 27th, 1888.\nJudge W. D. Harden,\n345, W. 34th-street, New York.\nMy Dear Friend,\u2014The delay in answering yours of the 9th inst. was\ncaused by Mrs. B., who sent me her answer only an hour ago, notwithstanding\nmy having reminded her a dozen times.\nAs you see from her statement, the exact date of the memorable seance\ncannot be given by her. But some coincidental occurrences, as you'll\npresently see, will make it the 13th or the 20th of May last. It is certain\nthat it was a Sunday, as Mrs. B. states, for I remember that, when I\nreturned from Wilmington Island that Sunday, Mrs. K. told me that Miss\nNina B. had been hero and had told her to inform me that something\nimportant had happened that afternoon, and she had pleasant news to com\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 241\nmunicate to me. I guessed at once what it referred to ; for they had all along\nbeen so anxious to get some information about that note, and I was present\nat the several previous seances, when ineffectual attempts had been made to\nget that information.\nWhen I was conferring with Mrs. B. for the purpose of getting at the date,\nshe at last remarked : \"It was about a week or two after Miss Ida entered Dr.\nNunn's service.\" I remembered that circumstance well, and thinking Miss\nIda might help to get at the date, I called on her. She distinctly remembers\nthe circumstances and thinks it was the second Sunday after. She told me\nthat she commenced with Dr. N. on Monday, the 7th of May last ; then the\nfollowing Sunday was the 13th and the second Sunday the 20th of May. I\nthought first that it would be possible to decide if it was the 13th or 20th\nby consulting the tide-tables\u2014making that Sunday the correct one on which\nthere was an afternoon flood tide. But on further consideration I see that\nwould not be perfectly reliable ; for although I generally selected such\nSundays for going down and coming up from the island on which there was a\nfavourable (flood) tide, still I did not do so invariably, because the prevailing\nsoutherly winds in summer permitted sailing up to Thunderbolt even against\nthe tide. So there is no means to decide whether it was on the 13th or the\n20th of May.\nI see Mrs. B. does not answer No. 2 of Dr. H.'s questions (date of\nsitting where question about the note was first asked) at all ; so I will do so as\nfar as I can. It was about a week after Major B.'s demise that the question\nwas put in my presence, and further at several subsequent seances at which I\nwas present ; but no exact dates could be given, further than that it\noccurred, say, between the 6th of April and the 13th of May, on several\noccasions in my presence, and in the presence of Mrs. B., Miss Nina B., and\nsometimes of the youngest child (Lettie, eight or nine years).\nIn answer to No. 5 of Dr. H.'s questions (\" Is Mrs. B. certain that neither\nshe nor her daughter put the vest away ? \") I have to state that I have the\nrepeated assurance of both the ladies that they feel sure that they did not\nput the vest away, nor that they had the least suspicion that there could have\nbeen so valuable a paper in that vest-pocket, or else they would have\nhunted for the vest in that drawer, among others where clothing might\nhave been stowed away, and thus should have discovered what they hunted\nfor.\nAnd as to question No. 4 (\" Can any more definite statement be obtained\nconcerning the putting away of the vest ? \") I have to state that Mrs. B. and\nMiss B. always thought that their cousin (Miss Mel Thomas), who had with\nthe most self-sacrificing devotion nursed the major during his sickness and had\nthe entire management of the sick room, had put it away. But on questioning\nher she said she had no recollection of so trifling an occurrence.\nIn answer to question No. 6 (\"Who were present ?\") Mrs. B. says,\n\" Possibly one of the children.\" I have to explain this answer. She ought\nto have answered, '' Possibly my youngest child, Lettie.\" For of her children,\nbesides Miss Nina, it is only Lettie who has something to do with these\nseances\u2014she being a far stronger medium than Mrs. B. or Miss B.\u2014but at\nthe same time does not feel the least interest in the matter ; on the contrary,\nhates to be called away from her dolls, puts her hands on the sliding-rod with\n\f242 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\na great deal of grumbling, and is always very glad to get off, the sooner the\nbetter.\nMiss Nina reported to me that that Sunday she and her sister Lettie were\nfirst holding communication with their father and received some pleasant and\nconvincing messages from their father ; then Lettie would not continue any\nlonger. It was then that Miss N. called her mother to take Lettie's place,\nand the result was the getting of that message in regard to the note. So, you\nsea, it may have been possible that Lettie had not left the room yet at the\ntime.\nI have also to state that great precautions are taken against intruding\nspirits that may personate (and on one occasion have done so, personating\nWillie Morrison, the young lawyer staying in Colonel Lester's office) and\ngive us all kinds of lying messages. These precautions consist in a secret\nsignal and a secret pass-word\u2014the two being necessary, since at one time\nthe intruders succeeded in getting hold of one ; but could not get hold of\nthe other too, and thus were foiled. To make doubly sure, the two signs\nof recognition are changed frequently.\u2014Yours truly,\nLouis Knork.\nOctober 27th, 1888.\nMr. Richard Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014In answer to your questions I will say : 1. Major B. died\njust at sunrise (Easter morning), first day of April, 1888. 2. I told all I know\nabout putting away the vest. 3. About three o'clock, Sunday, the first or\nsecond week in May. Myself and daughter were the only ones present that I\nremember\u2014possibly one of the children. It happened just as I stated. To\nme there is but one solution.\u2014In great haste, very respectfully,\n(Signed) E. F. B.\nThe next case is from a gentleman whose name cannot at present be\ngiven in full.\nG. 219.\nDr. Richard Hodgson. N.Y., November 1oth, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014Recently I learned that you are the Secretary of the American\nBranch of the Society for Psychical Research. Being interested in the sub\nject, I concluded to write to you, offering a statement of my own experience.\nAs so-ctilled spiritual manifestations are viewed unfavourably here, and as it\nwould be much to my detriment if my connection with the subject were to\nbecome known, I ask that my n^rne be withheld from the public\nFor the past five years I have been a so-called writing medium. The\nwriting is involuntary on my part, and the thoughts expressed are not mine-\nthat is, as far as I know they are not mine.\nSometimes, instead of writing, off-hand pen work will be done, but it is not\nof a very high order. In the writing the penmanship is generally very good,\nand the thoughts expressed are generally good, and are sometimes valuable.\nAs you are undoubtedly familiar with this class of writing, I will not go into\ndetails, but will leave you to inquire for such facts as you see fit.\nI am anxious to find a satisfactory explanation of this, and I hope the\nSociety may yet bo able to furnish one.\nAs an indication of the trend of my thoughts, I will add that for the past\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 243\n13 or 14 years I have been a student of the works of Herbert Spencer and\nother great men of liberal views, and that I am an evolutionist, so called.\nIf you think my experience will be of use, please call for it. You may\nsend questions, or you may state in a general way the outline of what will be\nof use.\nN.Y., December 22nd, 1891.\nDr. Richard Hodgson.\nSir,\u2014 . . . Five years ago I was in Vermont on business, and while\nthere made a visit at the home of a relative. In the evening, for amusement,\na planchette was produced and operated. Pretty soon it was written that I\nwas a writing medium, and I was requested to try with a pencil. I took a\npencil in my hand and to my surprise I found I could write some in the\n\"automatic \" manner. The writing was not very good and was accompanied\nwith more or less breaks and difficulties. It was written that practice would\nmake it much freer and better. This I found to be so. Persons in the room\nasked as to dates on pieces of money and other similar tests, and the answers\nwere generally correct. After that I wrote some almost daily for some time\nand soon became quite a ready writer in this manner.\nOn one occasion, not long after, a friend, of whose life I had known\nnothing until about that time, proposed to ask some questions mentally and\nsee if the answers written would be correct. It was written that the spirit of\nhis wife was present. I inquired (mentally) for her name. In reply her\nname was written out in full, correctly. I did not know her name : I knew that\nhe was a widower, and I knew no more of his wife or the matters inquired\nabout. My friend then asked (mentally) where she died and when 1 The\nanswers were correct. He then asked, \" What was the cause of her death ? \"\nThe answer, \"Heart disease,\" was correct. He then asked for the circum\nstances of her death. It was written that she died suddenly, at night, by\nthe side of him, in bed, and that the first thing ho knew of her death was\nwhen he found her dead in the morning. This was correct. He asked for\nher age, size, and for any particular mark by which she could be identified ?\nThe answer was correct as to age and size, and as to identification it was\nwritten that she had a large scar near the knee, caused by a burn. This was\nalso correct.\nMany other questions were asked and answered ; and whether he asked\nthe questions aloud, or mentally to himself, the answers were strictly correct\nin almost every instance. There was no one but us two present.\nOn another occasion, about the same time, I made inquiry (I was alone)\ntouching a case I was then investigating. Briefly, the facts are these :\u2014\nA wealthy widow, Mrs. X., had died at her summer cottage with no one\npresent save her sister and a neighbour. She loft a will : by its terms this\nsister was to receive several thousand dollars. Our client, Mrs. Y., was also\na legatee and the executrix of the will ; and as such it was her duty to collect\nin all assets. Our client knew it to be a fact that the deceased had in cash\nin her possession a short time before her death about $700. After Mrs. X.'s\ndeath no money was found, and the sister who was with her claimed there\nwas no money ; that Mrs. X. had no money at the time of her death about\nher, except some $15. Our client saw this sister and questioned her closely,\nbut to no purpose. I did not see or know this sister until some time after\nthe writing I am about to give. The question was, what had becomo of the\n\f244 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n$700 ? Alone by myself I asked for the facts, which were written out much in\ndetail, but in substance the facts as written were these : That the deceased\nhad on her person at the time of her death about \u00a7600 ; that she had spent\nthe other 8100 ; that immediately after her death her sister, Mrs. Z., had\nstolen the 8600 from her dead body ; that she had since spent some of it and\ndaposited the balance, some 8500, in a bank in the village of A. In tho\ncourse of a few days we made inquiry, and learned that Mrs. Z. had made\nthe deposit there, but had recently drawn it out. We then cited her before\nthe Surrogate, and she swore that just before the death of Mrs. X. (the same\nnight she died) Mrs. X. gave her the money, 8520, to give to a nephew\nas a present ; that there was only 8520 ; that she had just given it to the\nnephew. We commenced a suit against her for tho money ($520) and\nrecovered it. The jury did not believe her defence and made her pay. I\nhave only stated so much of the case as seems to bear on the \"automatic \"\nwriting. The question is, where did I get the knowledge of the theft, the\namount and the deposit in the bank ? I may add that we afterwards learned\nshe did spend some money about that time that we always thought was some\nshe took in addition to the \u00a7520, and it would have made the sum stolen\nabout 8600.\nAbout four and a half years ago an aunt of mine, Miss T., learned that\nshe had a cancer growing on her breast. She had it cut out, and soon was\napparently in very fair health. After a few months she began to fail very\nmuch ; was about the house, but was very generally run down. Cancer did\nnot reappear. She was not said by her doctors to be in any immediate\ndanger ; but for some reason I made inquiry, and to my surprise it was\nwritten that she was very badly off and that she would only live a very short\ntime. I inquired the cause, &c., and it was written that her system was\npoisoned through and through with cancerous matter. I inquired as to when\nshe would die ? The answer was that it was impossible to tell just when, that\nthe most that could be said was that she would live about thirty days, judging\nfrom a careful examination of her case made at that time. It was written that\nshe would certainly die, that she could not possibly get better or live much\nlonger than thirty days. Within the next week or so I inquired on several\noccasions as to the matter, but the answers were always to the same effect and\npositive. My aunt declined fast and died at the time set within a day, and I\nthink it was just 30 days. She was abed only 10 days or so. A post-mortem\nshowed she died from cancerous poisoning.\nOn many occasions I have made inquiry as to whether certain sick ones\nwould die or recover ; and if die, when ? Generally the answers proved very\ncorrect.\nAbout a year ago I was writing (for the spirit of deceased friend, Mr. A.\nso claimed). After some writing of a friendly nature, it was written sub\nstantially as follows :\u2014\"There is one thing that I wish you could do for me,\nbut I don't see how you can, and that is, stop my son \" (name fully given)\n\"from drinking.\" I answered (by thought), \"Why, I am surprised. Ho\ndoesn't drink, does he ? that is, not any to speak of, any way ? \" A. : \" Yes,\nI am sorry to say he drinks a good deal too much.\" Q. : \" Where does ho\ndo his drinking mostly ? \" A. : \" At the B. Hotel.\" I said I never heard\nof his drinking. A. : \" Well, you watch and inquire, and you will find out\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, cOc. 245\nthat he does.\" \" I should be very glad to be of some service in the matter.\"\nA. : \"If I see a chance where you can I shall certainly call on you.\"\nUpon investigation I found this was all true.\nIn May, 1887, while looking for authorities on an obscure point in a case\nI was then preparing for trial, it was written in substance : \"I know where\nthe authority is that you need.\" Q. : \"Where?\" A. : \"In WeitdeU's\nReports, Vol. \u2014, page \u2014.\" Q. : \" Who are you?\" A.: \"I am A. B.\"\nThe volume and page, as well as the name, were given in full ; the name\nwas that of an old lawyer that I had known well. The case cited was just\nwhat I needed. I had never seen or heard of the case before to my best\nknowledge. There are 26 volumes of Wendell's Reports, of about 700 pages\neach.\nI frequently find as I am examining indexes for judgment, debtors,\ngrantee's or grantor's, &3., in clerks' offices, and elsewhere, that there is\nthis same manifestation of intelligence in another form. Let mo explain :\nSay I am searching an index under the head of \" S,\" looking for the name\nof Stearns, John J. By placing my hand or finger on the book, drawing it\nalong down over the names, with no thought of the work in hand, as soon\nas my finger passes the name desired my finger will stop. My eyes must be\ndirected towards the book, but no matter how listless or absent-minded\nI may be, still at such times my finger will stop at the name in question.\nWhen contrasted with ordinary searching the unconscious intelligence that\nseems to be behind this is very marked.\nOnce, being much in doubt, I asked, \" What ails ? \" (one of my sons)\n\" What shall I do for him ? \" The answer wa3, \" You had better not try to\ndo anything for him, but go and get Dr. T. He will know what to do.\" I\ncalled Dr. T. He examined him and immediately gave an emetic. The\ncontents of the stomach showed that digestion had been stopped, or rather,\nthat the food had not digasted at all. The boy recovered rapidly. Dr. T. said\nit was well I called him. The boy had been rather suddenly taken ill a few\nhours after a hearty meal and soon after a severe fright or mental strain.\nIn a contested case over a certain clause or bequest in the will of C. we\nhad been defeated and were about to appeal to the Court of Appeals, our\nhighest court. It was my opinion, also my partner's, that we would win on\nthe appeal ; but upon inquiry it was written that we would be beaten, and\nthis opinion was expressed on several occasions, with very good reasons\nassigned. We were advised not to appeal. We brought the appeal and were\ndefeated.\nI have made many inquiries as to whether certain sick persons would\nTecover or die. The answers have been very correct, generally. Writing\ntouching the future is generally stated to be but an opinion, based on known\nfacts, and fallibility is freely admitted. When opinions are written the\nTeasons assigned are very frequently not only new to me, or unthought of,\nbut are generally good reasons.\nI have had a good deal of experience and made a good many tests. Those\nI have given are a fair sample, I think, of the writing that proved to be true.\nMany statements made wore false and many predictions made proved untrue ;\nof these I have given no illustration, but could if necessary. I have done\n-most of my writing when no one was present. Perhaps I should state that\n\f24G Mr. F. W. H. Myen\nit has been repeatedly written not to believe any writing or statement unless\nmy own good judgment approved of it. I have written a good deal touching\na future state, political and philosophical matters. Of all this I have not\nspoken, as it doos not seem of much importance for our present purposes.\nIn passing I will say that much of it was apparently very good, and quita\nreasonable.\nDecember 28th,\nSince writing the foregoing I have read your very able article [on\n\"Premonitions\"] in the Arena for January, and I have also had an\nexperience that may be of interest.\nOn Christmas Eve there was, as you are probably aware, a railway accident\nnear Hastings, a little way out from New York City, in which 12 persons\nwere killed and another has since died from injuries received. This last-\nmentioned person resided near me. The news of the injury to this person\nreached me on Christmas Day. Telegrams in the afternoon were favourable,\nand indicated a recovery.\nI made inquiry as to the matter, and it was written in substance that the\nperson would not recover. I suggested that telegrams indicated a recovery.\nThe answer was : \" Yes ; but we have made an examination, and are of\nopinion that no recovery will take place.\"\nTelegrams the second day were still more favourable, but my writing did\nnot change in opinion. The party died at nine o'clock on the evening of the\n26th.\nJanuary 20th, 1892.\nDr. R. Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your inquiry for such facts as I may be able to\ngive, touching the experiences given you by my husband, as automatic\nwriter, I will state :\u2014\nNot long after he began to write, some five years ago, I saw a sheet of\npaper upon which was written a full account of the robbing of the body of\nthe dead sister. I read the account carefully. My husband said that he had\nwritten it automatically ; that he had asked for the facts and that was the\nanswer. The account of it, as written out for you by my husband, is the\nsame in substance as what I saw and read, except it is very much shortened.\nI had the paper for some time, and, I think, until after the facts as given were\nproven true ; but it was destroyed long ago. I attended the trial of the suit\nbrought to recover the money. His account given you I believe to be\ncorrect.\nThe lady, Miss T., who had a cancer, was my aunt. The account of her\nsickness and death are correctly given you by my husband, but I saw no\nwriting, although my husband told me at the time he had written something\nconcerning her, and he stated that it was written that she would die and told\nwhen. I do not recall the time set, but I recollect her death occurred at the\ntime predicted.\nI recollect the time referred to when our son was sick. I saw my\nhusband doing some writing on that occasion, and it was written to go and\nget Dr. T. The account as written out for you by my husband is, as I\nrecollect it, true in every respect.\nConcerning the accident of Christmas Eve, I remember that on Christmas\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 247\nDay, after we heard of the accident, my husband did some writing. He said he\nhad inquired as to Mr. E.'s condition, &c., and that it was written that E.\nwould die, that he was internally and dangerously injured. On the next day\nthe answers that he received as to Mr. E.'s condition were to the same effect.\nThe telegrams received during the same time indicated that he would recover,\none reported him out of danger. E. died about nine on the night of\nthe 26th.\nI have known my husband to write out correctly quite a good many\nthings that were out of the knowledge of ordinary persons, but of the\ncircumstances which he has given to you I do not now recall anything\nfurther. [Mrs. W.]\nJanuary 29th, 1892.\nDr. Richard Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014I recollect the occasion referred to by Mr. W. I think it was\nabout five years ago. We were alone ; he spoke of the queer writing he was\ndoing. After some talk on the subject Mr. W. consented to try his skill. I\ninquired what spirits were present, and Mr. W.'s hand wrote that my wife\nwas. I inquired for her name, and he wrote Adelia O. B., which was correct.\nI also inquired where she died, and where and under what circumstances,\nand I asked for a description of her. Mr. W. wrote out answers to all\nthe questions as I asked them. As I recall it, I asked most of the questions\nby thinking. He wrote that she died of heart disease, and the date of her\ndeath was correctly given, as was also her personal appearance. And it was\nwritten that she died in bed with me ; that the first I knew of her death was\nwhen I awoke in the morning. He also wrote that there was a largo scar\nnear the knee on the left leg.\nI recollect that the answers were correct, although I don't recollect all the\nwords used, perhaps. I am very certain that Mr. W. did not know anything\nabout my wife. I had not lived within 20 miles of him, neither had I known\nhim until several years after the death of my wife. It puzzled me how he\nwas able to answer as he did, as I have no reason to think he had any know\nledge on the subject. I will add that the height, colour of eyes and hair and\nthe entire personal description given were exceedingly exact and correct.\nMr. W. also wrote on that occasion what purported to come from an old\nfriend of mine\u2014that he went fishing with me to Lake Ontario, that I tipped\nthe boat over near shore and got him wet. This was true, but I hadn't\nthought of it in a long time. Mr. W. never heard of it, I am confident, until\nhe wrote it out.\nS. H. Britton.\nAs soon as Mr. Britton called my attention to the tipping over of the boat\nI recalled that I wrote about it at the time, W.\nNew York, February 4th, 1892.\nDr. R. Hodgson.\n[In a subsequent letter, Mr. W. adds :\u2014] I began my automatic writing\nwith my left hand, and have ever since been able to write in that manner\nwith my left hand, but I am naturally right-handed, and I can write more\nrapidly and readily with my right hand, although the ideas expressed, &?.,\n\f248 Mr. F. IF. H. Myers.\nare of as high an order, as far as I have observed, when written with one\nhand as when written with the other.\nIn automatic work, when the mechanical ability to form letters is not\nrequired, as, for instance, in running the hand down an index, I find my\nleft hand is fully the equal of my right. Perhaps I should state that I met\nwith a serious injury to my right hand many years ago, by which I lost the\ntwo first fingers and greatly crippled my hand otherwise.\nThe reason that I did my first automatic writing with my left hand was\nthat the planchetto directed me to do so. I wrote a day or two with my\nleft hand and then I tried my right, and since that I have generally written\nwith my right. I can write some slowly in the natural manner with my left\nhand, but have never done so but very little. The special point I wish to\ncall attention to is, that the ideas automatically writian are of as high an\norder, written with one hand, as with the other.\nI will conclude the present instalment of evidence with the third\nmotor message already mentioned;\u2014a case singularly interesting, as\nrecording what purports to be the successful accomplishment of an experi-\nm^nt whose partial failure in one carefully watched instance we have\nalready recorded. (Vol. VI., p. 657.) It is an experiment which every\none may make;\u2014which everyone ought to make ;\u2014for, small as may be\nthe chances of success, a few score of distinct successes would establish\na presumption of man's survival which the common-sense of mankind\nwould refuse to explain away. If accepted, the incident shows a\ncontinued perception on the part of the decedent of the efforts made by\nfriends to communicate with him.\nG. 220.\nThe first account, says Dr. Hodgson, which I received of the following\ncase was given in an article by Herman Snow in the Religio-Philosophical\nJournal for January 31st, 1891. Mr. Snow wrote as follows :\u2014\nThe most perfect spirit identity test which I find upon my records is as\nfollows : It occurred in the town of Kingston, Mass., about twenty-five years\nago, and was related to me by the Unitarian minister of the place in whose\nparish the parties resided. All the facts were well known to him and per\nsonally vouched for to me. There lived in that town a young man of marked\nspirituality, who was also a poet of a high order of inspiration. A volume\nentitled Cousin Benja's Poems, written by him, was held in high esteem\nby many Spiritualists of the earlier times. The home of this young man was\nwith a sister, between whom and himself existed ties of affinity and affection\nof unusual strength and permanency. But the brother was a confirmed\ninvalid. Consumption had laid its irresistible hand upon him and was slowly\nbut surely loosening the immortal from the mortal of his being. Knowing\nthis, and having a firm faith in the spirit's power to return, but being at the\nsame time, as an advanced spiritual thinker, aware of the difficulties in the way\nof a perfect identification, he told his sister that he would try to arrange\nmatters so that she would have satisfactory proof of his return to her when at\n\fOn Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge, &c. 249\nlength he should be fairly over to the other side of life. And this was the\nway it was done : He took a piece of soft brick and carved it into a slender\noblong form, and taking it to his sister broke it in two pieces, giving one to\nher with the injunction to take good care of it ; the other, he said, he would\nhimself take care of. He also especially enjoined upon his sister that after\nhis departure she should give him an early opportunity of communicating\nwith her to the end that the proposed test might be consummated. When at\nlength the time came, it was communicated to her that if she would go into\nthe carefully arranged room formerly occupied by him, and look upon a cer\ntain shelf in the corner now designated, she would find a large sea-shell ; and\nin the recess of that shell she would find the mate to the piece of brick he\nhad given her. This was done, and thus was the test made complete. For,\non trial, the two pieces were found exactly to fit into each other, thus proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that this discovery of the piece of brick was made\nby the brother, the only one who had known of its hiding place.\nBelvidere, N.J. Herman Snow.\nThe Unitarian minister, the Rev. J. H. Phipp, who informed Mr. Snow\nof the case, died in 1871. We learnt the address of the decedent's sister,\nMrs. William A. Finney, from the Rev. Courtland Y. de Normandie, who is\nnow pastor of a church in Kingston, Massachusetts.\nMr. Snow has also sent us a transcript from his note-book of his\nfirst article on the subject, written at San Francisco, January, 1881,\nand published, he thinks, in 1881, in the Religio-Philosophical Journal.\nThe later article is merely a repetition of this earlier account. We\nhave therefore two independent memories,\u2014one at third hand from\nMr. Snow, recorded 15 years after the event, one at first hand from\nMrs. Finney, recorded 25 years after the event,\u2014closely coinciding\n\u2022with each other.\nThe following letters on the subject have been received from Mrs.\nFinney :\u2014\nRockland, Mass., April 19th, 1891.\nMr. Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014Some weeks ago I received from you a few lines asking me to\ngive you an account of the communication received from Cousin Benja in\nspirit-life, some twenty-five years ago.\nFor weeks and months before my brother left the form we conversed\nfreely on the subject of spirit communion and such matters, and one morning\nhe requested me to bring him a small piece of brick, also pen and ink ; he\nthen made two marks on one side and one on the other with the ink, then\nbreaking the brick in two, gave me one piece, telling me at the time to take\ncare of it, and some day he would hide the other piece away where no one\nbut himself would know, and after leaving the form, if possible, would return\nin some way and tell me where it was. I could then compare them together,\nand it would be a test that he could return and communicate, and my mind\nCould not have any influence over it, as I did not know where he put it.\nAfter he left the form our anxiety was very great to hear and learn all we\ncould of communicating with spirits, and for months we got nothing satis\nfactory,\n3\n\f250 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nWe then commenced sitting at the table at home (mother and myself),\nwhich we did for some little time ; at last it commenced tipping, and by\ncalling the alphabet spelled out where we could find the piece of brick that\nhe put away,\u2014that was the way we got the test. To us that was truth that\nspirits can and do communicate with us, and nothing but the influence and\npower of Benja could tell us that test.\u2014Truly yours,\nMrs. Wm. A. Finney.\nRockland, Mass.\nRockland, May 3rd, 1891.\nMr. R. Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of April 21st received, and I will add a few more lines\nas to statement of brother Benja's communication.\nBy calling the alphabet we spelled out :\u2014\n\"You will find that piece of brick in the cabinet under the tomahawk.\u2014\n\"Benja.\"\nI went to that room and took the key, unlocked the cabinet, which had\nnot been touched by anyone after he locked it and put away the key. There\nI found that piece of brick just as it had spelled out, and it corresponded\nwith the piece I had retained, fitting on exactly where he broke it off the\npiece I had. It was wrapped in a bit of paper and tucked into a shell, and\nplaced in the bottom of the cabinet exactly under the tomahawk, as was\nspelled out by the alphabet.\nThis is truth, and no power but Benja's could tell that.\nMother is not living ; I am the only one of the family that is living.\u2014\nYours respectfully,\nMrs. Wm. A. Finney.\nRockland, Mass.\nRockland, May lltft, 1891.\nMr. R. Hodgson.\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of 6th received. I will continue to say, in answer to\nyour questions, that the piece of brick was entirely concealed in the shell, so\nthat it could not be seen from outside of cabinet. It was wrapped in a piece\nof paper stuck together with mucilage and tucked into the end of the shell,\nthen a piece of paper gummed over that, so that nothing was visible from the\nshell.\nThe shell was on the lower shelf of the cabinet, and only the top of the\nshell was visible outside the cabinet.\nOne more little incident I will mention, for to me it is as valuable as the\nother. He wrote me a letter (about the time he gave me the piece of brick)\nand sealed it, saying at the time it was not to be answered, but the contents\nof the letter to be told. I got that in the same way I did the other, by\ncalling the alphabet and the table tipping. It was these words :\u2014\n\"Julia! do right and be happy,\u2014Benja.\"\nThat was correct. Just the contents of my letter. I have no particular\nobjection as to giving my name, for I have stated nothing but the truth,\n. At my home in Kingston I have that little shell with the piece of brick,\nAnd if you would like them I will send them to you.

I have placed one piece in the shell just as it was when\nI found it, so you can see how nicely it was concealed in the shell. The\npapers that were around it then are worn out. You cm retain them if you\nlike, as I do not care for them now.\nTo me it is a positive truth that he did communicate to us, and our minds\ncould have nothing to do with it.\nJ. A. Finney.\nRockland, July 19th, 1891.\n. . . The shell was placed on the same shelf with the tomahawk,\nand no other shells on that shelf. It was placed with the open side\ndown, and the tomahawk stood directly over it. I cannot say why he\ndid not tell us to look inside of the shell. We started to look as soon as he\ntold us. It was in the cabinet under the tomahawk, We did not wait for\nany more to be said.\nI am not intimately acquainted with many public people. As to my\nintegrity, will refer you to Rev. C. Y. de Normandie, of Kingston.\nJ. A. Finney.\nThe shell is a large Triton, about ten inche3 long. The piece of brick\nwas wrapped in folds of soft paper and tucked deeply into the recess.\nAnother piece of paper was then gummed around the sides of the shell in the\ninterior, so as absolutely to prevent the piece of brick from falling out. When\nI received the shell from Mrs. Finney and looked into the interior and shook\nthe shell violently, there was nothing to indicate that the shell contained\nanything but the piece of gummed paper.\nThe piece of brick in the shell weighs one and a half ounces, and the\npiece of brick retained by Mrs. Finney weighs about two and a quarter\nounces. The shell with the piece of brick and paper wrapping weighs about\neleven and a half ounces.\nMrs. Finney also forwarded me the letter written by her brother. The\nshell and the pieces of brick and the letter are now all in my possession.\nR. Hodoson.\nWe have a letter (in original) from the Rev. C. Y. de Normandie, of\nKingston, Canada, to Mrs. Finney. \"I expressed then,\" he says, speaking\nof a former note to Dr. Hodgson which accidentally went astray, \"that to\nthe best knowledge I had of you and to my firm belief your word could be\nimplicitly relied on. I felt confident that you would state a matter as you\nunderstood it, as you regarded it, without reference to the consequences ; and\nthat you would not be any more likely to be misled and deceived about a\nmatter of that kind than others similarly situated. \"\nThe experiment which was in this cass successful is one which\nmight be tried by everybody.

DAVEY'S IMITATIONS BY CONJURING OF PHENOMENA\nSOMETIMES ATTRIBUTED TO SPIRIT AGENCY.\nBy Richard Hodgson, LL.D.\nIn the Introduction which I wrote (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV.,\npp. 381-404) for the late Mr. Davey's \"Experimental Investigation,\"\nconducted for the purpose of ascertaining \" the possibilities of mal-\nobservation and lapse of memory from a practical point of view,\"\nI pointed out that \" to explain the tricks would in itself be of little\nadvantage to the investigator of the 'physical phenomena' of mediums\";\nthat other methods than those employed by Mr. Davey may be (and\nunquestionably are) practised ; and in any case that explanations of the\nmethods in use would hardly be likely to convince persons who have\ntestified from personal experience to the genuineness of the \"psycho-\ngraphy \" of well-known \" slate-writing \" mediums that such methods\nwere used for the production of the phenomena which they witnessed.\n\"They will scarcely,\" I said, \"be likely to remember the occurrence of\nevents which they perhaps never observed at all, or observed only\npartially and erroneously ; which, whether correctly or incorrectly\nobserved, they have afterwards continually misdescribed or completely\nforgotten ; and which, in many cases, would be distinctly excluded by\nthe acceptance of their testimony as it stands.\" The notes appended\nto the detailed reports quoted in the article referred to would, we\nthought, sufficiently show to the reader the several kinds of mistakes\nmade by intelligent witnesses in recording their impressions of per- \u2022\nformances like Mr. Davey's, and would enable the student\u2014not\nnecessarily to discover in every case the exact modus operandi of the\ntricks, for this appeared to us to be of trivial importance, but\u2014to\nappreciate the unreliability of human testimony under circumstances\ncommon to such performances. It was, indeed, my own personal opinion\nthat on the whole it was advisable that the methods of Mr. Davey\nshould be descrilaed in detail, as far as possible, though in many cases\nit would be difficult to explain verbally exactly what occurred so that\nthe reader could enter fully into the situation. Mr. Davey, however,\nwas strongly opposed to the revelation, and for various reasons. His\nchief objections, I believe, were that other methods than the ones\nwhich he employed had probably been used by pseudo-mediums, that\nnew methods would doubtless be invented, that the description of his\n\fMr. R. Hodgson.\nmethods would interfere greatly with his projected plan of giving nume\nrous additional sittings and obtaining further reports (in connection\nwith which he proposed to explain his methods fully), and that many of\nhis sitters would be annoyed at finding precisely how they had been\ndeceived. Mr. Davey's death has removed the only argument\u2014I may\nnow freely say\u2014which had special cogency in my own case, viz., his\npurpose to give another series of sittings, all of which should be\nattended by a person thoroughly familiar with his methods, and\ncognisant beforehand (so far as such cognisance was possible) of the\nprecise things which he intended to do ; this person was to write an\naccount both of what was intended and what he witnessed ; Mr. Davey\nwas to supplement this account by his own statements ; and these\naccounts were to be compared with the reports of the sitter in each\ncase. The object, of course, in this projected later series was to em\nphasise still more forcibly the unreliability of the testimony so widely\naccepted, among Spiritualists, as adequate to establish the genuineness\nof the manifestations in question.\nIt appears, however, that the accounts of Mr. Davey's sittings pub\nlished in Vol. IV. of our Proceedings are in themselves more than\nenough to demonstrate the affirmed unreliability of such testimony, and\nto justify the position originally put forward by Mrs. Sidgwick that\nthe possibilities of mal-observation and lapse of memory must be abso\nlutely excluded before the testimony to \" slate-writing \" and similar\nperformances can be taken into further serious consideration. This is\nclearly shown by the communication which formed the immediate\ncause of this article, viz., the letter of Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace\nprinted in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research for\nMarch, 1891, in which he stated that Mr. Davey's performances \"are\nclaimed to be all trick, and unless all can be so explained many of us\nwill be confirmed in our belief that Mr. Davey was really a medium as\nwell as a conjurer.\" At the close of my Introduction to the reports of\nMr. Davey's sittings, I asked the \" experienced Spiritualist \" to \" point\nout exactly where the difference lies between ' Mr. Davey's perform\nances ' and mediumistic phenomena.\" Mr. Wallace has accepted this\nchallenge in the name of \" many of us \" ;\u2014there is no more illustrious\nname than his upon the roll of adherents to a belief in Spiritualism ;\nand his reply is substantially a confession that he cannot distinguish\nbetween Mr. Davey's performances and ordinary \" mediumistic \"\nphenomena. But, strangely enough, as it appears to Mrs. Sidgwick\nand myself, and others who were familiar with Mr. Davey's devices,\nMr. Wallace's conclusion seems to be, not that the analogous pheno\nmena which have been reported about \" mediums \" were due to trickery,\nbut that Mr. Davey's performances were \"mediumistic\"! The issue\nhas changed. We are no longer asked to prove that this or that\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, iScc. 255\nmedium is a \" trickster \" ;\u2014we are asked to prove that Mr. Davey\nwas not a medium ! Could any better evidence be offered that Mr.\nDavey's performances and those of certain professional mediums belong\nto the same class 1\nNow, I am not at all sure how far my explanations of Mr. Davey's\ndevices will make clear to Mr. Wallace and the many others who agree\nwith him, that every apparently \" phenomenal \" occurrence at his\nsittings can be accounted for by ordinary means. It is impossible to\nreproduce all the details of the sittings, so that the reader may have a\nfaithful picture of the seemingly insignificant incidents that made the\nwriting upon a slate on or under the table, or the turning over of one\nor two slates, or the substitution of one slate for another, or the secreting\nand carrying out of the room (to deal with at leisure) of one of the\nsitter's own slates, appear to the instructed and watchful observer so\ntransparently easy. I should have much greater confidence did I know\nthat these doubters of Mr. Davey's dexterity were familiarising them\nselves with such books as Professor Hoffmann's Modern Magic and\nMore Magic, Mr. John W. Truesdell's Spiritualism, Bottom Facts, and\na recent book published in America by Farrington and Co. (St. Paul,\nMinn.), entitled Revelations of a Sjoirit-Medium. Above all, I recom\nmend these doubters to experiment for themselves. It may be difiicult\nfor them to obtain the assistance of a person like Mr. Davey, but they\ncan at least study from books on conjuring the details of many per\nformances commonly exhibited on the public stage, and by accompanying\ntheir uninitiated friends to the entertainment, and listening to their\naccounts of the tricks afterwards, they will be, I venture to think,\nconsiderably helped towards a proper appreciation of the misdescriptions\nusually given of such performances, and will perhaps begin to see the\nabsurdity of attributing \" mediumship \" to Maskelyne, or Lynn, or\nDavey. In this direction at least the account of Mr. Davey's methods\nmay prove serviceable.\nI shall begin by giving a brief statement of the chief methods used\nby Mr. Davey and then illustrate his actual practice by describing in\ndetail some of the most important occurrences at sittings where I was\npresent myself. I shall then state what occurred, according to Mr.\nDavey, at the sittings particularly noted by Mr. Wallace as remarkable,\nand finally give the explanation of other incidents which without such\nspecial reference might still remain incomprehensible. Had I foreseen\nmy departure for America, and my continued stay here, and therefore\nthe impossibility of my conducting such a later series of experiments\nas I have mentioned above, I should doubtless have reduced to written\nrecord at the time the details of the sittings which I myself witnessed,\nas well as Mr. Davey's statements concerning the other sittings. As it\nis, I must depend upon my recollections, assisted by the contemporary\n\f25S Mr. R. Hodgson.\nnotes published, in connection with the reports, in Vol. IV. of the\nProceedings. With the regular methods employed by Mr. Davey I was,\nof course, very familiar, as he frequently practised them in my presence,\nand consulted me about variations of them. Further, I talked them\nover in detail with Mrs. Sidgwick and Professor Hoffmann, and was\npresent at five out of the sixteen sittings reported, and saw them used.\nI questioned Mr. Davey at the time about all the incidents at the\nsittings where I was not present, and was perfectly satisfied with his\nexplanations, I may add that I have seen similar methods used by\n\" mediums \" in America, as will be seen later from my account of a\nvisit to the notorious medium Slade.\nReferring to the reports, it will be noticed that the manifestations\nmost frequent at Mr. Davey's sittings were:\u2014(1) Writing on the\nupper surface of a single slate held against the underside of the table ;\n(2) Writing on the upper surface of the under slate when two slates\nwere placed together above the table ; (3) Writing in Mr. Davey's locked\nslate. I shall describe the normal method used in each case ; I say\n\" normal,\" because differences between the sitters as to their attention,\n&c, together with other incidental circumstances, produced, in almost\nevery instance, certain slight variations from the prescribed steps.\n(1) The slate having been cleaned and placed near the edge of the\ntable on top, with a piece of pencil or chalk upon it, Mr. Davey\ntakes a thimble-pencil from a hip-pocket, and slips it on the end of a\nfinger, say the third, of the right hand. A thimble-pencil is a\ntailor's thimble with a small piece of pencil (or chalk) fastened to it.\nHe then draws the slate over the edge of the table, with the thumb of\nhis right hand on top of the slate, the finger with pencil being tucked\ninto his palm, brings the first and second fingers up to the under\nsurface of the slate, and slowly slides the slate under the table,\nrequesting the sitter on his right to hold the slate with him, and U>\nkeep it pressed closely up to the under surface of the table. The sitter\ndoes so. The slate is out of sight, but the thumbs of the holders are\nvisible. The sitter, in response to Mr. Davey's suggestion, asks a\nquestion. Mr. Davey writes the answer noiselessly with his thimble-\npencil on the under surface of the slate, without the knowledge of\nthe sitter. After an interval of waiting, he proceeds to withdraw the\nslate, ostensibly to see if anything has been written. He places it on\nthe table, and by that time the sitter has let go of the slate. Nothing\nis found written (on the upper surface of the slate, where the sitter\nknows that the writing is to appear if it comes at all, and where\nalone inspection is made). Mr. Davey lifts the piece of pencil off,\nrubs the upper surface again with a cloth, then seizes the slate with\nthe fingers uppermost, and the thumb underneath, raises the slate\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 257\nfrom the table and places it once more under the table, turning the\nslate over as it is going under the table, and just before pressing it\nagainst the under surface of the table, drops upon it again a piece of\npencil from the table. The answer to the question is now on the\nupper surface of the slate, pressed against the table. He then reminds\nthe sitter to hold the slate also, and asks that the question be re\npeated. After a short interval, the sound of writing is heard, caused\nby Mr. Davey writing (for it is possible to write either with or with\nout noise), on the now under surface of the slate, the answer to a\nquestion not yet asked, and which Mr. Davey may ask himself after\nthe next insertion of the slate under the table. The slate is then\nwithdrawn as before, the answer on the upper surface is read, that\nsurface is cleaned by Mr. Davey ; the slate is again placed under the\ntable and turned as before in the process. And so on.\n(2) Writing on the interior surface of one of two slates held to\ngether above the table.\nOne slate has already been written upon, during or previous to the\nsitting, and this lies, writing downward, upon the table. Mr. Davey\ngives two other similar slates to the sitter to examine and clean, asks\nhim to place pencil (or chalk) on one of them on the table, cover it\nwith the other, and place his hands upon them. Mr. Davey also\nplaces his hands upon them. After an interval of waiting Mr. Davey\nsuggests looking to see if there is writing. The sitter removes his\nhands, Mr. Davey takes off the top slate and places it with seeming\ncarelessness on one side close to where the third slate is lying, and after\nremoving the pencil, say, from the other slate, and perhaps rubbing\nit again with the duster, which afterwards is perhaps thrown on the\nslate just removed, and placing some pieces of chalk again on the\nslate, he takes the third slate (writing already on the under surface)\nand places it on top. The sitter and Mr. Davey place their hands on\nthe slates as before. After another interval of waiting Mr. Davey\nproposes to hold the slates in the air, or resting against the sitter's\nshoulder. The sitter raises his hands from the slates. Mr. Davey\ntakes the two slates together, the fingers of his right hand above,\nthe thumb below, and in lifting them from the table turns them both\nover together. This movement is probably completed by the time the\nsitter also takes hold of the slates. After a short time, a sound as of\nwriting is heard, and when this is finished, the sitter lifts the top\nslate, and finds the upper surface of the lower slate covered with\nwriting. But what produces the sound as of writing ? Sometimes the\nfinger-nail of Mr. Davey on the under surface of the bottom slate, some\ntimes a movement of his knee to which is attached a piece of common\nslate-pencil, the ends resting in two small loops of rubber sewn on to\nhis trousers. He chafes this piece of pencil against another piece\n\f258 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nattached to a fragment of wood from which project two fine steel points,\nby means of which he easily secures it to the pendent rim or the leg of\nthe table. This was Mr. Davey's variation, I believe, on the idea\nsuggested by the wedge-shaped clamp illustrated by Mr. Truesdell.\n(Spiritualism, Bottom Facts, p. 199.)\n(3) Writing in the locked slate.\nMr. Davey has two locked slates precisely alike, i.e., as precisely\nalike as skilled workmanship could make them. In some cases a com\nmunication was prepared beforehand, and when a reply was not de\nmanded to some specific question, a single substitution was all that\nwas required. When a question was asked in the locked slate, two\nsubstitutions were needed. Thus, a question is written by the sitter\nin locked slate A. Mr. Davey substitutes locked slate B for A, opens\nA and answers the question (usually taking it out of the room for the\npurpose), and later on re-substitutes it for B.\n\" Well, but,\" I hear some readers say, \" I want to know exactly\nhow and when he makes these substitutions, and besides, how and when\ndoes he cover the side of one of the sitter's own slates with writing 1 \"\nIt is just these questions that are difficult to answer satisfactorily\nwithout introducing the whole mise en scene, so to speak, of the sitting.\nI think, however, that a tolerably fair conception may be formed by\nconsidering several of the reports and describing, as far as I can now\nreproduce them, the immediately connected details. But before doing\nso I shall describe Mr. Davey's usual method of substituting one of\nhis locked slates for the other. This might almost be called his favourite\ndevice.\nThe first step was to engage the attention of the sitter on some\nother object. This was usually done by starting an experiment with\nanother single slate.or pair of slates. While the sitter was occupied in\ncleaning a slate, or examining pieces of pencil or chalk, or inspecting\nthe writing that so \" mysteriously \" appeared on the ordinary slate, Mr.\nDavey was manipulating his \" duster,\" a cloth which he used for dry\ning the slates. This, after perhaps drying a slate with it, he would\nthrow, apparently carelessly, over the locked slate on the table, and so\nas to hide this slate completely. Then, under cover, occasionally, of\nthe use of his handkerchief, he would slip the other locked slate from\nhis coat pocket or from beneath his waistcoat, slide it softly upon the\nedge of the table, and, bending over the table somewhat, with .\npossibly one arm resting far forward on the table, so as partly to\nobstruct the view of the moving slate, push the slate softly forward till\nit was near the first slate concealed by the \" duster.\" He would then\nsometimes boldly remove the duster with the first slate inside, and,\nbelow the surface of the table, slip the slate beneath his waistcoat,\nafterwards replacing the duster on the table. Sometimes after the second\n\fMr. Davey'a Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 259\nslate had been placed upon the table, he allowed the first slate, covered\nby the duster, to remain on the table also for a considerable interval,\nowing to the possible danger of removing it without detection. On\none occasion it remained there, I think, for more than a quarter of an\nhour, until at least the conclusion of the sitting, when he gathered up\nhis various articles into his bag. While the sitter was wondering at\nthe long communication in the second locked slate, thefirst locked slate,\nunder the duster, was lying within his reach on the table before him.\nLet us now consider the above explanations in detail with special\nreference to Sitting II. (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., pp. 426-435.) For\nconvenience of reference I here reproduce portions of the accounts :\u2014\nMrs. Y.'s Account.\nA piece of chalk was placed on one of our slates, and the slate was held\ntightly up against the underside of the table leaf by one of Mr. Davey's hands\nand one of my daughter's. Their thumbs were on top of the table, and their\nhands spread underneath on the underside of the slate. I held Mr. Davey's\nother hand, and we all joined hands around the table. I watched the two\nhands holding the slate without a moment's intermission, and I am confident\nthat neither Mr. Davey's hand nor my daughter's moved in the least during\nthe whole time. Two or three questions were asked without any sign of\nresponse. Then Mr. Davey asked rather emphatically, looking hard at the\ncorner of the table under which they were holding the slate, \" Will you do\nanything for us 1 \" After this question had been repeated three or four\ntimes, a scratching noise was heard, and on drawing out the slate a distinct\n\" Yes \" was found written on it, the chalk being found stationary at the point\nwhere the writing ceased. As my eyes wore fixed uninterruptedly on both\nmy daughter's hand and on Mr. Davey's also, and as I certainly had fast\nhold of his other hand all the time, I feel confident he did not write this word\nin any ordinary way. This same result was obtained two or three times.\nMiss Y.'s Account.\nMr. Hodgson brought us a little pasteboard box, in which were a number\nof small pieces of chalk of different colours. I chose two of these and placed\nthem on one of our slates. We had all previously written either our names or\nour initials on that side of the slate. Mr. Davey slipped the slate under the\nedge of the table, I holding on to it all the time, and we held it flat under\nthe table with our thumbs above the table. I held the slate very firmly\nagainst the table, and I am sure I did not relax my hold once. After waiting\nsome time and asking various questions, we heard, or seemed to hear, the\nchalk moving on the slate. We drew the slate out, and on it was written\n\" Yes,\" which was an answer to our last question. We again put the slate\nunder the table, and, in order to be sure that nothing had been written on\nit,' I half slipped it out again and saw that it was perfectly clean. After\nsome more waiting, my father asked when we were to sail for America. The\nchalk again squeaked, and on drawing the slate out we found \" the 18th \"\nwritten very indistinctly. This happened not to be the date, which was the\n15th.\n\f260 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nThere is no mention of the previous withdrawals in either of these\naccounts. Mr. Y., however, did remember them, and recorded them\nin his report.\nAt the first and second examination nothing was on the slate, and it was\nwashed afresh, and soon the word \"Yes\" was found scrawled on the upper\nside of the slate as an answer to some indifferent question.\nMr. Davey did not venture to write the word at once, and did not\nproduce his writings continuously. The first part of a sitting was\noften a time of tedious waiting, so that the vigilance of the sitters\nmight, become relaxed, and so that they might be accustomed to regard\nthe withdrawals of the slate as having no special meaning, if, indeed,\nit should ever occur to a sitter that they were suspicious. After one of\nthe early withdrawals, Mr. Davey, having previously written the word\nyes on the under surface of the slate, turned the slate over in the act\nof replacing it, and, of course, during this interval Miss Y.'s hand was\nnot holding the slate. She had relinquished her hold when the slate\nwas placed on the table. Mr. Davey then asked his own question, to\nwhich the yes was a proper reply. Similarly after one of the later\nwithdrawals, Mr. Davey, having written \"the 18th\" on the under\nsurface as a reply to a question previously asked by Mr. Y., and having\nturned the slate over in the act of replacing it, requested Mr. Y. to\nrepeat his question. \" On what day do we sail for America ? \"\nThereupon the writing was apparently produced, and the answer\nexhibited proved to be relevant, though the date given was not correct.\nIt would weary the reader were I to point out all the discrepancies\nbetween the reports which I quote, such as that Mrs. Y. speaks of \" a\npiece of chalk,\" and Miss Y. speaks of \"two\" pieces as having been placed\non the slate. It is important, however, to emphasise here that although\nthe slate was several times withdrawn from under the table, and Miss\nY. on these occasions relinquished her hold of it completely, yet there\nis not the slightest indication in the above accounts that Miss Y.'s hold\nwas ever relaxed at all, or that there was a single withdrawal when\nnothing was found written upon the slate. These are instances of the\ncomplete omission, from the record, of circumstances without which\nthe trick would have been impossible. They were due to lapse of\nmemory rather than to mal-observation, since at the times of the\nwithdrawals the sitters were doubtless aware of them. The turnings of\nthe slate as Mr. Davey replaced it under the table were probably not\nobserved ; that is to say, it was not observed that his method of placing\nthe slate under the table brought the unexamined surface to the top.\nAfter this explanation I think that the reader will find no difficulty\nin seeing exactly how the similar \" phenomena \" recounted in the other\nreports, in connection with a single slate held under the table, were pro\nduced. He must supply, of course, the \" withdrawals \" and the accom\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, iSsc. 261\npanying circumstances, since these are completely omitted from nearly\nall the records, and where the withdrawals are mentioned there seems\nto have been no conception, in the mind of the witness, of their\nsignificance.\nProceeding to the cases of writing appearing between two slates\nabove the table, I quote the three different accounts from Sitting II.\nMrs. Y.'s Account.\nAfter a short rest, Mr. Davey asked us to wash two of our own slates and\nput them together, with pieces of chalk of different colours between, and all\nof us to reach across the table and hold them all together. This we did, and\nthen Mr. Davey asked my husband to choose mentally three colours he\nwished used in writing. After all holding the slates closely pressed together\nfor a few minutes, we placed them on the table, and Mr. Davey and I placed\nour hands on them while the rest joined hands. In a few moments the same\nsort of electric shock seemed to pass through Mr. Davey, and his hand and\narm which were on the slates quivered nervously, and immediately a scratch\ning noise was heard. He then asked me to lift one slate off the other, which\nI did, and found one side covered with writing in three colours, the very\nthree my husband had mentally chosen. I am perfectly confident that my\nhand was not removed from the slates for one single instant, and that I never\nlost sight of them for a moment.\nMiss Y.'s Account.\nAfter this experiment, we put aside Mr. Davey's slate and took two of our\nown. We cleaned them, and placed on one a number of little pieces of\ncoloured chalk. The second slate was put on the first one, and my mother\nitnd Mr. Davey held it above the table. Mr. Davey asked my father to think\nof tltree colours. We joined hands once more, and in a little while we heard\nwriting between the slates. When we took one off, on the under one was\nwritten :\u2014\nIn red, \" We are very glad to be able to give you this.\"\nIn while, \" We can do more yet.\"\nIn green, \" Good-bye.\"\nMy father had thought of red, white, and blue. We could not be sure by\nthe night light whether the \" good-bye \" was written in green or blue. But\nthere was a piece of chalk on the slate that looked much more blue than the\npiece with which the \"good-bye\" was written.\nMr. Y.'s Account.\nWe next placed small pencils, in six colours, between two of my newly-\nbought slates, marked by ourselves with our names written in pencil, without\nremoving them from the top of the table, and the hands of some of the party\nwere laid upon them for some minutes, after which they were held up in the\nhands of two persons. I had been asked to choose the colours in which the\nwriting should be made. I mentally chose red, white, and blue, but did not\ntell my choice. After holding Mr. Davey's hand for some minutes, with my\nmind strongly fixed on these colours, the slates were opened, and we found,\nin the order I had mentally selected : \u2014\n\f262 Mr. R. Hodgson,\n(Red) \" We are glad to be able to give you this,\"\n(White) \" We can do more yet.\"\n(Blue) \"Good-bye.\"\nThe slates used were the three ordinary school slates which Mr. Y.\nhad purchased on the way to the sitting, which was held at my rooms\nat Furnival's Inn. The experiment preceding this was with Mr.\nDavey's locked slate. 'While the sitters were still pondering over the\nwriting that had appeared in the locked slate, Mr. Davey retired to\nan adjoining room, taking with him, under his waistcoat, one of Mr.\nY.'s slates. He there wrote upon the slate in red, white, and blue,\nthinking that if Mr. Y. were asked to choose mentally three colours,\nhe would be more likely to select these three than any others. (I\nbelieve that Mr. Davey usually had red, green, pink, blue, yellow, and\nwhite chalks at his sittings.) Returning to the room and the table he\nsurreptitiously placed this slate on the table again, writing downward,\npushed Mr. Y.'s remaining two slates, which we may call thefirst and\nsecond, forward, and requested that these should be cleaned thoroughly.\nAfter the cleaning, Mr. Davey placed some coloured pieces of chalk\nupon the first slate and covered it with the second. According to my\nremembrance, Mr. Davey then lifted the two slates a little from the\ntable and asked all the sitters to join in holding them. After a short\ninterval he suggested looking to see if there was any writing, and\nthe slates were lowered to the table, the sitters removed their hands,\nand Mr. Davey took off the top slate (the second), showing the\nunder surface of it where there was no writing, and placing it on\nthe table close to the third slate. Moving the chalks slightly, to\nbe assured that there was no writing, he \" replaced \"\u2014not the\nsecond slate which he had just removed, but\u2014the third slate, which\nalready had the writing on the under surface. He then placed his\nhands upon the slates, and so also did one or more of the sitters. After\nanother short interval, Mr. Davey suggested holding them up in the air ;\nthe sitters lifted their hands, Mr. Davey seized the slates, raised themr\nturned them over together and requested, I believe, Mrs. Y. to join in\nholding them. At this stage I think that the sitters all stood up and\nthat Mr. Davey then called upon Mr. Y. to think of three, colours to be\nused in the writing. Very shortly the sound as of writing was heard.\nWhen the sound ceased, Mr. Davey let go of the slates, and the writing\nwas found on the upper surface of the lower slate.\nIt is probable that my remembrance of the scene even where it is\nclear and distinct is wrong in some points, and on others even my\nremembrance is not clear. I cannot recall very clearly, for example, at\nwhat point Mr. Y. was asked to think of three colours. He may have\nbeen asked earlier to choose mentally three colours, and the request may\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 263\nhave been repeated later. But these points are unimportant for my\npresent purpose, which is to show the reader how the trick was done.\nI witnessed Mr. Davey abstract the slate ; I witnessed him in the act\nof writing the message in the adjoining room ; I witnessed him return\nthe slate to the table, and afterwards substitute it for the other slate,\nand I witnessed him turn both slates over together as he raised them in\nthe air. These were the important points for me to watch, as I knew\nbeforehand.\nNow for the omissions in the reports. In the first place, Mr. Y. and\nMiss Y. refer nowhere in their whole reports to the fact of Mr. Davey's\nleaving the room. Mrs. Y. refers to it, but supplements her reference\nby stating that \" the slates were all the time in full view on the table\nwith the rest of us who remained behind \" ! If she could but have\nseen Mr Davey's hurry and excitement in the other room while he\nwas preparing the message on one of her own slates !\nIn the second place, there is not the slightest indication, in any one\nof the three reports, that the slates were separated during the experi\nment after they had once been placed together, yet they were not only\nseparated, but the separation was used for the purpose of substituting\na third slate for one of the two cleaned for the experiment. (All three\nslates, I believe, had been marked at the beginning of the sitting, but\nno special markings were made for this particular experiment.)\nWe may now turn to the other cases where this particular trick\nwas performed, and notice certain variations in the details. In Sitting\nI., the reader will easily be able now to supply the omission made by\nthe two recorders ; the top slate was removed and the third slate sub\nstituted in a manner similar to that described above. But in this case\nMr. Davey wrote on the slate before the sitting began. Mr. R. took\nthree slates to the sitting, and he states that there \" could not\npossibly \" have been \" any tampering \" with them, \" as during the\nwhole seance they never for one moment left the room.\" This last\nassertion is true, but Mr. R. gives 7.30 p.m. as the time of his going\nto Mr. Davey's house, and the sitting did not begin till 8.30 p.m. In\nthe meantime Mr. Davey had taken one of Mr. R.'s slates and Mr.\nR.'s box of chalks also into another room, and written upon the slate,\nand rubbed away the corners of some of the fragments of chalk and\npencil, and brought them back to the room. What occasion was there\nfor the intending sitters to watch their slates then ? The sitting had\nnot begun, and besides, Mr. Davey had, let us say, given them some\ninteresting curios or remarkable photographs to examine while he ex\ncused himself for a few moments. Later on, the sitting begins. Mr.\nDavey takes the parcel of slates : \" Ah ! these are your slates, Mr. R.\nVery glad you've brought your own slates. If anything comes,\nyou see, it's so much more satisfactory. We'll try first if we can get\n\f2G4 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nany writing on one of your own single slates. Better clean it\nthoroughly,\" at the same time holding up the top slate for Mr. R.\nto take, and of course he takes it. The slate upon which Mr. Davey\nhas written is the lower one of the remaining two, the writing being\non the under surface ; and these two slates remain on the table in full\nview while the experiments with the single slate are in progress. This\nimportant lower slate, however, becomes completely forgotten, tempo\nrarily at least, when the sitters are preparing the other two slates for\nthe second form of experiment, at which time, had there been any\nneed, Mr. Davey might have written upon it again. Hence Mr.\nDavey's note to this sitting that \" although Mr. R.'s slates did\nnot leave the room during the seance, one of them was left unguarded\non the table on one occasion for about sixty seconds.\" As a matter\nof fact, however, as Mr. Davey assured me, he wrote upon this slate\nbefore the sitting began.\nThe next instance of this \" manifestation \" occurs in Sitting IV.,\nheld in my rooms ; Mr. Padshah had taken three new slates, but had\nleft them in my rooms while he made a call upon some friends. In the\nmeanwhile Mr. Davey arrived, and used the opportunity to write on\none of Mr. Padshah's slates, which he then placed at the bottom.\nWhen we were ready for the sitting, Mr. Padshah having returned,\nMr. Davey began by passing round his locked slate for inspection,\ncleaning, ifec. He then took the top one of Mr. Padshah's slates for\ntrials with a single slate held under the table, leaving the two other\nslates in the middle of the table. Later on, in the midst of experi\nments with the single slate, he lifted the top slate of these two, placed\nsome coloured chalks on the lower one, and placed the other slate again\non top. The other important movements I may give in the words of\nmy friend, Mr. J. Russell, who saw them. He had not been initiated\ninto the modus operandi, but he did know definitely and positively\nthat Mr. Davey's performances were not \" mediumistic,\" and he was\nacquainted with the object of Mr. Davey's investigations. Mr. Russell\nis naturally an exceptionally keen observer, and he noticed and re\ncorded the important trick-movements, of which there is no mention in\nthe reports of the other two uninitiated witnesses. I therefore add his\ntestimony to my own. Mr. Russell writes in his report :\u2014\nIn the meantime, Mr. Davey had once more examined the two slates\nwhere the coloured chalks were, but finding nothing, had placed them side by\nside, and carelessly, as if in a fit of absent-mindedness, had taken the chalks\nfrom the slate which had been at the bottom, and placed them on the other.\nHe had then put them together as before, except that the original position of\nthe slates was reversed, the old bottom one being now at the top, and the old\ntop one at the bottom. Presently, asking Mr. Padshah if in a former sitting\nwith Eglinton the medium had not got some writing on'Jus shoulder, he took\nup the two slates and placed them on Mr. Padshah's shoulder, but in less\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 265\nthan a minute took them off, reversing them as he did so, and replaced them\non the table. The old bottom slate was now once more at the bottom, and\nthe old top one at the top, but each slate had been reversed, so that the two\nsides which had originally been turned to the table were now turned up. In\na few minutes Mr. Davey had a sort of convulsion, Mr. Hodgson and Mr.\nHughes said they heard sounds like writing, the slates were opened, and\nthere, on the lower one, was a message, half in green, half in red (nearly\nthe colours chosen by Mr. Padshah and my wife), expressing a hope that we\nshould be satisfied with writing given thus, under such excellent test con\nditions.\nNow, from the point of view of the psychologist analysing the value\nof human testimony, I regard Mr. Padshah's reports as in several\nrespects the most instructive of the whole series. Mr. Padshah's mind\nis pre-eminently clear and sincere, and his report, written immediately\nafter the sitting, is an excellent expression of the effects produced upon\nhim. We can see, so to speak, a piece of wonderful testimony (as\nregards this particular manifestation) in the act ofmaking, but not made.\nDescribing the commencement of the sitting, Mr. Padshah wrote :\u2014\nThere was full light on every corner of the table ; two of my (?) slates,\none washed by myself, the other by Mr. Davey, were put very nearly in the\ncentre with a number of small chalk-pieces between them of different colours.\nLater on, in discussing this manifestation, Mr. Padshah wrote :\u2014\nI confess I do not remember, even after such a brief lapse of time, whether\nI had examined the two slates not washed by me, and found them unwritten.\nI imagine I must have, for otherwise it would be very stupid.\nHere, in the first place, we see that while Mr. Padshah's memory told\nhim at the commencement of his report that one of these two slates had\nbeen washed by himself, bis memory told him, apparently, a short time\nlater that neither of these slates had been washed by himself. This, at\nleast, seems to be the fair inference from his words. But the next\npoint, concerning the examination of the slates, is more important.\nHe imagines, ho says, that he must have examined the slates, \" for\notherwise it would be very stupid.\" In the case of ninety-nine out\nof a hundred bondfide witnesses the statement in their report would\nnot* have taken this form. Their imagination that they must have\nexamined the slates would have usurped the place of their failing\nremembrance, and they would have written, with perfect sincerity,\n\" I examined the two slates and found them perfectly clean.\"\nThe same general method was employed in Sittings V., VI., VII.,\nIX., XII., and XV., the slates being Mr. Davey's, and the communica\ntions having been prepared beforehand, and I think that the reader\nwill have no difficulty now in supplying the omissions which vitiate the\nrecords. The choice of colours and the transcription of passages from\nbooks chosen by the sitters, and the writing in foreign languages, I\nshall consider later.\nX\n\f2G6 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nIn Sitting VIII. the word Yes was found on the upper surface of the\nlower of two of the sitters' slates held together. This word was written\non the top of one of the sitter's slates while the sitter was glancing over\nthe books on the shelves for the purpose of choosing one for the locked-\nslate experiment. I saw Mr. Davey write it on the slate, as the slate\nlay on the middle of the table, and then turn the slate over. This slate\nafterwards reached the required position by the regular method. After\nthis experiment came that of the locked slate, which was also a success,\nand while the sittsr was wondering over the locked-slate message, Mr.\nDavey took one of his slates into another room and covered one side of\nit with writing. This interval the sitter speaks of parenthetically as a\n\" momentary absence.\" After Mr. Davey's return the two-slate experi\nment was conducted in the regular way, and was indeed completed; but\nMr. Davey got nervous, shuffled the slates out of position again, and\nhardly knew himself what had become of the writing. In trying to\nmake up for this false move he slipped again, the sitter noticed a\nshuffle of the slates, seized them, and discovered the writing \" before\nits time.\"\nAs regards the \" two-slate \" incident which occurred in Sitting\nXVI., Mr. Davey informed me that before the sitting began, and while\nexchanging greetings in the ordinary manner, he undid the parcel con\ntaining the slates brought by Miss Symons, took out one of her slates,\nsubstituted for it a new slate brought by himself, and tied up the\nparcel again,\u2014all this with his back to the parcel so that his move\nments might be concealed from Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss Symons. He\nthen left the room, ostensibly to fetch his own slates, ,fec, from another\nroom, and while absent, wrote on the slate belonging to Miss Symons.\nMiss Symons herself carried the parcel, now containing Mr. Davey's\nslate, to the seance table without, of course, noticing anything wrong.\nHer slate, with writing on it, was placed among Mr. Davey's own\nslates, and, when the time came, in the course of the two-slate experi\nment, was re-substituted openly, as described in detail by Mrs. Sidgwick\nin the following account, which was written the day after the experi\nment, and before she knew how and when the trick was done. (The\nfootnotes are a later addition.)\nMiss Symons had brought two common slates and a locked one. Mr.\nDavey had also slates with him of various shapes ; one of them with round\ncorners as Miss Symons's had, and some with square corners. Miss Symons's\ntwo slatesi were held together on the table and under the table by her and\nMr. Davey. Then one of Mr. Davey's square-cornered slates was substi\ntuted for one of them, then again removed, and the two round-cornered ones2\ni This is, of course, a mistake. It was the two slates out of the parcel, but one\nof these was really Mr. Davey's.\n\u00bb Really Miss Symons's this time.\n\fMr. Davey'a Imitations by Conjuring, d-c. 2G7\nagain held, on the ground that though it might be easier to get writing on\nMr. Davey'a slate, it would be more satisfactory to get it on Miss Symons's.\nWe waited a considerable time. Mr. Davey asked me to draw the curtains\nbetween the two rooms. Then we sat as before, the two slates on one\nanother on the table, and our hands on them. The sound of writing was\nheard, and presently on looking between the two slates, one of them was\nfound to be written on all over one side. I cannot remember every detail\nof what occurred, but the impression produced on my mind most distinctly\nwas, that one of Miss Symons's slates had been written on all over one side,\nand that there had been no possible opportunity for Mr. Davey to have\ndone this.\nWe now come to the experiments with the locked slate. In addition\nto the two similar locked slates of small size which I have already\nmentioned, Mr. Davey had some other similar locked slates of large size,\nof the Faber make. One of these is represented in Proceedings, Vol.\nIV., pp. 46G, 467. My impression is that he had three similar slates of\nthe large pattern. He most frequently, however, used the smaller size,\ndescribed by Mr. H. W. S. in Sitting XI., as \" composed of two\nordinary pieces of slate, about six by four inches, mounted in ebony\ncovers hinged on one side with two strong plated hinges, and closed in\nfront, beyond the question of a doubt, with a Chatwood's patent lock.\"\nLet us call these two locked slates A and B, and suppose that A is the\nfirst locked slate exhibited. I shall now describe in detail the locked\nslate incident in Sitting II. Mrs. Y.'s account of this is as follows :\u2014\nHe gave me a locked slate of his own, which I thoroughly washed and\nlocked myself, and put the key in my own pocket. We then joined hands,\nand Mr. Davey and my daughter placed one hand each on the slate as it was\nlying on top of the table. Different questions were asked, and we waited\nsoma time, but no response came. Mr. Davey seemed to me very much\nexhausted, and I urged him to desist from any further efforts. But he\nseemed loth to do this, and said he would rest a little while, and would then,\nperhaps, be able to go on. After a short time of conversation, the slates all\nthe while being in full view and carefully watched by me, we again tried it,\nunder the same conditions as before, only that this time Mr. Davey requested\nns each to take a book at random from the shelves in the room, and mentally\nthink of two numbers representing a page and a line, and he would see if he\ncould reproduce it. This also failed of any result, and Mr. Davey said he\nfeared he was too tired to produce anything, as he had been very much\nexhausted by a long and very successful seance the night before. We again\nbegged him to desist, but after a short rest ... he insisted on another\ntrial. The slates still remained all the time in full view on the table. Mr.\nDavey asked my daughter to choose another book, which she did at random,\nhe having his back to her and standing at some distance while she did it.\nThis book was at once tied up and sealed by one of the party, Mr. Davey\nnever touching it from first to last. I then held it in my lap, while we\njoined hands as before, and Mr. Davey and my daughter each put one hand\non the slate. Still nothing came. Then we changed positions, and I placed\n\f2G8 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nmy hand on the slate instead of my daughter, giving her the book to hold.\nDuring this change she kept her hand on the slate until I had placed\nmine beside it, and the book was awaiting her on the opposite side of\nthe table, my husband all the while holding Mr. Davey's other hand.' I\nam confident that Mr. Davey could not possibly have manipulated the slate\nduring this change, for it was in full sight all the while, and our hands\nwere on it, and the book was tied and sealed on the opposite side of tho\ntable. A few minutes after this readjustment Mr. Davey seemed to have\na sort of electric shock pass through him, the perspiration started out in\ngreat drops on his forehead, and the hand that was touching mine quivered\nas with a nervous spasm. At once we heard the pencil in the slate moving,\nand in a few moments Mr. Davey asked me to unlock tho slate. My\ndaughter took tho key out of her pocket and handed it across the table\nto me, and I unlocked the slate, and found it covered on both the inner sides\nwith writing. When read, this writing proved to be a sort of essay or exhorta\ntion on tho subject of psychical research, with quotations from the book\nchosen intermingled throughout. I forgot to say that Mr. Davey had asked\nus all to choose in our minds two numbers under ten to represent a page and\na line of the book, but had finally concentrated his thought on what my hus\nband was thinking. In the writing there were quotations from every page\nwe had any of us thought of, but not always the line ; but in the caso of my\nhusband the line was correct, but not the page. l1e had thought of page 3,\nline 8. The line was quoted from page 3, and Mr. Davey said this confusion\nbetween 8 and 3 frequently occurred, because of the similarity of the\nnumbers. This test seemed to me perfect. The slate was under my own eye\non top of the table the whole time, and either my daughter's hand or my own\nwas placed firmly upon it without the intermission of even a second. More\nover, we closed and opened it ourselves.\nThis sitting was held in my rooms in the evening. In the morning\nMr. Davey came to my rooms, and re-arranged some of my books. He^\nplaced a series of greyish-white books (chiefly Cambridge University-\nCalendars) on a shelf easy of access, and in the middle of them he put\na volume of selections from Mrs. Browning's poems after first copying\nsome phrases from it. This book had a blue binding with gilt lettering\non the back. The communication afterwards found by the sitter em\nbodying these phrases from the book, I saw Mr. Davey then and there\nin the morning write in the locked slate. At the first trial of this\nexperiment, the volume of Mrs. Browning was not chosen. No result,\ntherefore, was obtained. At the next trial Miss Y. chose the required\nhook. Now, Mrs. Y. states that Mr. Davey had his back to her\ndaughter and was \"standing at some distance while she did it.\" Mr. Y.\nalso says, \" My daughter, leaving him at the table, replaced on the\nshelves the book she had first taken down, and took at random a copy\nof Mrs. Browning's poems.\" Miss Y.'s own account of this part of\nthe incident is also positive :\u2014\nWe sat as before around the table, discussing the failure of the experi\nment. Finally Mr. Davey started up and said, \"We must try it with one\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, i&c. 2GD\nbook alone. Will you choose one, Miss 1 \" I supposed that he asked me\nto do it because my seat was nearest to the bookcase. I got up and went to\nthe bookcase. Mr. Davey stood by the table with his back to me. That\nlatter fact I feel as if I remember most distinctly. I mention it to show\nthat I chose my book at random and was not influenced in my choice by him.\nAs a matter of fact Mr. Davey escorted Miss Y. up to the book\ncase and led her, as it were, up to the very shelf where the required\nbook, in bright contrast to its dingy neighbours, was \" forcing \" itself\nto be chosen. \" Choose a book, any book, take any book at random,\"\u2014\nwith a wave of the hand in front of the special shelf, and Miss Y., quite\nnaturally, reached out her hand and took the book that \" fixed \" her\ngaze. I gave in my previous notes what I thought was the probable\nexplanation of the agreement of all the witnesses in the erroneous\nstatement that Miss Y. went alone to the bookcase to choose her book.\nAfter the writing had been produced in the locked slate, Mr. Y. asked\nMiss Y. if she had gone alone to the bookcase, and she replied that she\nhad, and that Mr. Davey had remained by the table with his back\ntowards her. I conjectured also that Miss Y.'s lapse of memory was an\ninstance of transposition, that she remembered correctly Mr. Davey's\nactions, but connected them wrongly with her second choice of a book\ninstead of with her first.\nBy the \" forcing \" of this book the first step in the trick was per\nformed. The next step was to substitute locked slate B for A, But\nthe sitters were very careful, as the reader may notice from the\naccounts of their actions when Mr. Davey suggested that Miss Y.\nshould change places with her mother. Miss Y. kept her hand upon\nthe slate as she walked round the table, and correctly says that she\ndid not relax her hold of the slate till her mother had her hand upon\nit. Nevertheless the time came when Mr. Davey did substitute B for\nA. But there is no mention whatever, in Mrs. Y.'s report, of the cir\ncumstances which enabled Mr. Davey to perform the substitution.\n* Nor is there any mention whatever of these circumstances in Mr. Y.'s\nreport. They are mentioned, however, in the report of Miss Y.\nMr. Davey asked us each to think of two numbers as before. Finally he\nasked us to write them down on a slate. I wrote mine on one of our own\n.ulates so that he could not possibly see what I had written, and I placed it\non the table away from Mr. Davey, and leaned my elbow on it. I think the\nothers did the same with the other slates. To my remembrance, some of us\nwatehed the locked slate all the time while we were writing.\nMiss Y.'s remembrance, about which she was apparently not sure,\nis not correct. At this juncture all the sitters forgot the locked slate\nmid left it unguarded on the table. My impression is that all the\nsitters left the table, Mr. Davey having so candidly remarked that they\nmust not let him see the numbers they wrote, and not let him even see>\n\f270 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nthe movements of the end of the pencil. I then saw Mr. Davey with\nthe help of his cluster (see p. 258) substitute locked slate B for A.\nI may mention that Mr. Davey gave a plausible reason for desiring the\nsitters to write their numbers down, viz., that a previous sitter had\nforgotten the numbers which he had finally chosen, and therefore could\nnot tell whether the passages quoted in the writing were according to\nthe chosen numbers or not.\nIn Sittings I., III., V., VIII., IX., and XV. the modus operandi\nwill now be obvious. In each case the communication was prepared\nbeforehand, and an opportunity was given for the substitution of B\nfor A.\nIn connection with Sitting IV. it is noteworthy that Mr. Padshah,\nwho was not perfectly satisfied that he had taken due precautions in\nexamining the two single slates, and in seeing that all the surfaces were\nclean, did become absolutely convinced that the locked-slate writing, if\nnot produced by chemical means, was \" undoubtedly genuine.\" Mr.\nDavey, as he had done for Sitting II., came to my rooms in the morn\ning, and placed in a \" forcing \" position, with the neutrally tinted\nnumbers of the periodical Mind in its neighbourhood, Bastian's volume\non Tlie Brain as an Organ of Mind, a bright red book of the Interna\ntional Scientific Series. Mr. Davey wrote on the locked slate in my\npresence the communication afterwards found there by Mr. Padshah,\nincluding the words, \" The Brain an Organ of Mind.\" When asked to\nchoose a book Mr. Padshah finally chose (mentally) the periodical Mind,\nafter having thought both of The Brain as an Organ of Mind and of\nInternational Law. Mr. Padshah's conclusion about this experiment\nwas that it is \"evident that Mr. Davey must have' minutely studied the\ntime it takes for complete precipitation ; or that the whole precipitation\ntakes place simultaneously ; or that the phenomenon is undoubtedly\ngenuine. The theory of writing without a chemical and then bam\nboozling me would be really contemptible.\" As I pointed out in my\ncontemporary notes to this sitting, Mr. Padshah did nevertheless lose\nperception of the slate A for a short time, and during this interval Mr.\nDavey substituted B.\nIn Sitting VI. a double substitution was made. The sitter wrote a\nquestion in A. Mr. Davey substituted B, opened A, read the question\nand answered it, and re-substituted it again. Mr. Davey's usual method\nin these cases was to take A out of the room for the purpose of reading\nand answering the question. Later on, the substitution was made again\nfor another experiment, B having been prepared beforehand, and the\nbook to be chosen by the sitter placed in a \" forcing \" position.\nSitting X. was with a Japanese gentleman, and the locked slate used\nwas of the large size. The first locked-slate experiment involved\nmerely a simple substitution. This was all that was involved in the\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 271\nsecond locked-slate experiment also. The Japanese part of the\nmessage was easily enough obtained. Mr. Davey had met the sitter\nbefore and had obtained some information about him. He then went\nto the \"Japanese Village\" on exhibition in London, and for a con\nsideration procured the services of an interpreter in translating and\nwriting in Japanese on the locked slate the communication which Mr.\nDavey provided in English. The sitter says : \" Once more I locked the\ndouble-slate . . . and put the key in my pocket and even sealed it\nmyself.\" Mr. Davey suggested the sealing, but he substituted the\nsecond locked slate for the first before the sealing took place. (Com\npare Zollner's experiment with Slade. Mrs. Sidgwick supposes that\nSlade substituted for two slates put together by Zollner two other slates\nupon which he\u2014Slade\u2014had just written. Journal S.P.R., December,\n1886, p. 481. This case of Mr. Davey's is exactly parallel.)\nIn Sitting XI. there was a double substitution in experiment [a].\nIn experiment [c] there was a single substitution. Experiment [d] is\ndescribed by the sitter as follows :\u2014\nLastly, as requested by Mr. Davey, I took a coin from my pocket with\nout looking at it, placed it in an envelope and sealed it up. I am certain\nthat neither Mr. Davey nor myself knew anything about the coin. I then\nplaced it in the book-slate together with a piece of pencil, closed it as\npreviously and deposited it on the table ; and having placed my hands with\nthose of Mr. Davey on the upper surface of the slate, waited a short time.\nI then unlocked the slate as requested, and to my intense amazement I found\nthe date of the coin written, by the side of the envelope containing it.\nThe seal and envelope (which I have now) remained intact.\nI do not recall with certainty what the coin was. Let us suppose it\nwas a shilling. Mr. Davey beforehand wrote the date of a shilling of his\nown in locked-slate A, placed this shilling in an envelope and sealed it\nup, and placed this envelope also in locked-slate A, which at the begin\nning of the experiment he had concealed about his person. He then\nrequested the sitter to take a shilling from his pocket without looking\nat it, to place it in an envelope and seal it up, place it in the locked-\nslate (B), ifec. The sitting was at Mr. Davey's house, and Mr. Davey\n.provided the envelope, from the same packet, of course, as the one\nalready containing Mr. Davey's shilling in locked-slate A. The sitter\nwas requested not to look at his coin, ostensibly, I believe, on the\nground of precluding thought-transference, but really so that the sitter\nmight not know the difference between his own coin and Mr. Davey's.\nIt is now plain that all the dexterity required in this experiment was\na simple substitution.\nIn the locked-slate experiment described in Sitting XII. there was\na double substitution. In the first locked-slate experiment in Sitting\n\f272 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nXIII. there was a double substitution. For the second there was a\nsingle substitution.\nMrs. Sidgwick has furnished the following account of the locked-\nslate experiment in Sitting XV. :\u2014\nWe then [after the writing of the word Melbourne] again sat at the\ntable, Miss Symons next to Mr. Davey. She now took charge of the locked\nslate, which at this period was examined and was blank. [Then follows the\naccount of obtaining the message with the Spanish sentence in it.] It was\nnot easy to read, and while we were engaged in deciphering it Mr. Davey\nwas still gasping and suffering apparently from the effects of tho effort. He\nwandered restlessly about the room, with convulsive movements, &c. After\na time ho seemed better, and we determined to try another experiment.\nA book was chosen out of Mr. Podmore's bookshelf and laid on the table\nunder our hands, and Miss Symons and Mr. Davey sat next each other, this\ntime holding the locked slate.\nThe locked slate was unguarded while we were poring over the first long\nmessage, and there was plenty of time and opportunity then either to\nsubstitute another similar one or to write the message. Moreover, the book\nchosen was the one wished for by Mr.' Davey. He made various objections\nand suggestions till I perceived that for some reason he wanted that one and\nchose it. I tried at first to choose a small book because I wanted the trick\nto succeed, and fancied it would be done by holding the book on the slate\nunder the table and opening it there. Whether I should have been conscious\nof acting on anything but my unaided impulse [in choosing the large book]\nif 1 had not wanted to help Mr. Davey [by choosing a small one] I do not\nknow.\nI shall now describe the method of producing writing on the interior\nsurfaces of common slates screwed and corded together and the knots\nof the cords sealed. For accounts of this experiment see Sittings XIII.\nand XIV. I quote here the account given in Sitting XIII.\nI now took the two new slates which I had purchased, and which had\nnever for a moment passed out of my possession, I even taking the pre\ncaution of sitting on them during the foregoing proceedings. I placed a\npiece of red crayon therein, and screwed them down top and bottom so\ntightly that by no possibility could even the thin edge of a penknife be\nintroduced. I then corded the slates twice across and across, sealing them in\ntwo places with red and blue wax (for, of course, any attempt to remove the\nseals by heat would cause the- colours to fuse, and thus immediately detect\nthe artifice), stamping them with my own private signet. Mr. Davey placed\nthe slates under the table, and requested me to name some word I would\nUke written. I stipulated for \"April.\" After a few minutes, during which I\nmost carefully watched him, ho returned them, and after 10 minutes' work,\nso tightly were they closed, I found exactly what I had desired.\n. After perusal of above, considering that the expression, \"I\nfound exactly what I desired,\" might be liable to a possible misconstruction,\nI think it better to add that I state in the most unequivocal, explicit, and\n\fMr. Davey a Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 273 .\nemphatic manner, that after Mr. Davey had returned me my two slates,\nsecured as above described, and which I most carefully and minutely ex\namined to detect any signs of tampering, finding, however, my seals intact\nand the cording and screws in exactly the same condition as when they left\nmy possession a few moments before, and that the word \"April,\" which I\nhad asked for, was legibly written with the crayon, on one of the inside\nsurfaces. Whether the top or bottom I did not observe. The apparently\nimpossible having thus been solved as I hereby testify.\nThe sitter might also have sealed the screw-heads without preventing\nthe performance of the trick.i Mr. Davey takes the slates thus prepared\nand places them in a horizontal position between his right leg and the\nadjoining leg of the table. He holds them in that position by the pres\nsure of his right leg. He then takes from his hip pocket a wedge with\na fairly sharp edge for insertion, but with the other edges smoothened\nso as to avoid indenting the frames of the slates. I think that the\nwedge that Mr. Davey used was made of brass, and was somewhat\nmore than two inches long and about half an inch wide. He forces\nthis wedge between the frames of the two slates at a point farthest from\nthe screws. Thus if the screws are on the top and bottom of the slates,\nhe forces the wedge in at the middle of one of the sides. There is\nenough elasticity in the frames and the cords to prevent any injury to\nthe frames or the cords or the seals. An opening a quarter of an inch\nwide is easily produced in this way. Leaving the wedge in position he\ntakes from the hip of his trousers, where it has been fixed by the\ninsertion of its ends in two small rubber loops, a piece of an umbrella\nrod, say seven or eight inches long, in the end of which is fastened a\npiece of pencil or chalk. This he inserts through the aperture produced\n\\ In this connection the following extract from an account of a seance by Mr. T.\nO. Roberts, whom Mr. Davey characterises as \" without exception the keenest witness\nI have ever met,\" may be of interest. The- seance took place on April 23rd, 1887,\nlater than any recorded in Mr. Davey's paper in Proceeding!, Part IV. Mr. Roberts\nwas, I believe, aware that Mr. Davey was a conjurer.\nMr. Roberts \"purchased two common slates with wooden frames (Sin. x Din.) and\nrounded corners.\" He continues :\u2014\nI cleaned theslates myself and placed a small piece of grey chalk . . . between\nthe slates, which I then placed together, noting which were the inner surfaces by a\nprinted heading at the top of each ; I next drilled six holes through the frames, one at\neach end, and two at either side, into which I drove six screws, these tightly binding\nthe two slates together, placed my seal on the head of each screw, then bound the\n\u2022slates with thick cord and sealed the ends after tying the final knot.\nWhen I handed the slates, thus prepared, to Mr. Davey, he told me that the test\nwas too severe, and that he did not think that it would be possible to produce the\nwriting under such circumstances, but expressed his willingness to try.\nOperations commenced by his placing the slates under the flap or leaf of the table\nnear the corner, supported by the fingers of his right hand while his thumb rested on\nthe table ; with my right hand I held his left above the tableand with my left I assisted\nin supporting the weight of the slates in the same manner as adopted by him.\n\f274 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nby the wedge, and writes the words required. He withdraws the rod\nand the wedge, replaces them in their private receptacles, and brings\nthe slate above the table.\nThe writing or drawing produced under an inverted tumbler placed\non a slate on top of the table is described in several accounts. (Sittings\nI., II., and XVI.) The following is Mrs. Y.'s account of this experi\nment in Sitting II. :\u2014\nHe placed one of our slates on three little china salt-cellars that lifted it\nup about an inch from the table. Upon the middle of this ho placed several\npieces of different coloured chalks, and covered them with a tumbler. Then\nhe told my husband to form a mental picture of some figure he wished to\nhave drawn on the slate under the glass, and to name aloud the colour he\nwould have it drawn in. He thought of a cross, and chose aloud the blue\ncolour. I suggested that blue was too dark to be easily seen, and asked him\nto take white, which he agreed to. We sat holding hands and watching the\npieces of chalk under the tumbler. No one was touching the slate this time,\nnot even Mr. Davey. In a few minutes Mr. Davey was again violently\nagitated as with an electric shock, which went through him from head to foot,\nand immediately afterwards we taw, with our own eyes, each one of us, tho\npieces of chalk under the glass begin to move slowly, and apparently to walk\nof their own accord across the space of the slate under the tumbler. My\nhusband had said just hefore that if the piece of red chalk under that\ntumbler moved, he would give his head to anyone who wanted it, so sure\nwas he that it could not possibly move. The first piece of chalk that began\nto walk about was that very red piece ! Then the blue and white moved\nsimultaneously, as though uncertain which was the one desired. It was\nutterly astounding to all of us to see these pieces of chalk thus walking about\nunder the glass with no visible agency to move them ! All the while Mr.\nThe word selected by me to appear between the slates was \" Parnell.\"\nAfter remaining in this position for some fifteen minutes, during which time I\nwatched his hand most carefully, and thwarted what appealed to me to be his several\ndevices for diverting my attention, he informed me he could not produce the writing\nunlets I allowed him to take the elates out of the room I\nTo this I assented, feeling that I was beginning to expose his inability to rival the\n\"spirit-mediums\" if only ordinary watchfulness were exercised. While these and\nsimilar thoughts crossed my mind.the door opened, he returned with the slates, having-\nonly been absent from the room 3 minutes. I then examined the slates most carefully,\nand I solemnly assert that my seals were intact in every case and that the slates wero\nbolted together so tightly that it would have been impossible to introduce even the\nblade of a penknife between them, while my cord round them was as tight as when it\nleft my hands, and the sealed ends were undisturbed.\nTho task of unscrewing the slates, &c, occupied several minutes, and this I per\nformed myself, when I confess, greatly to my surprise, that the word \" Parnell \" was\nclearly and distinctly written on the inner surface of the lower slate. This I was at a\nloss to account for, especially as the piece of chalk that was enclosed had no sign of\nfriction whatever upon it, this being evident at a glance, as the ends thereof had been\nnewly broken.\nI neither know nor pretend to understand how this trick is done, but I congratu\nlate Mr. Davey on the celerity displayed by him, and the skill he undoubtedly\npossesses.\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 275\nDavey, whose hands were held on one side by myself and on the other side\nby my husband, seemed to be on a great nervous strain, with hot hands and\ngreat beads of perspiration. When the chalks stopped moving, we lifted the\ntumbler, and there was a cross, partly blue and partly white, and a long red\nline marking the path taken by the red chalk ! We were impressed by this\ntest beyond the power of words to declare. The test conditions were perfect,\nand the whole thing took place under our eyes on top of the table with no\nhands of anybody near the slate.\nThe ostensible reason for placing the slate on the salt-cellars was\nthat the slate might be insulated, so that the explanation of \" electri\ncity \" might not be offered ! Mr. Davey has a fine silk thread attached\nto one end of a button on his waistcoat. To the other end is fixed a\nsmall piece of red wax, which except when in use in the experiment\nis in his pocket together with the slack of the silk thread. While\nplacing the slate on the salt-cellars with his left hand he takes the piece\nof wax between the fingers of his right hand, picks up with these\nsame fingers some pieces of chalk,\u2014moves his right hand forward to\nthe other side of the slate\u2014not yet placed in position\u2014so that the\nthread shall be under the slate when the slate is placed on the salt\ncellars. He then places the slate in position, brings his hand down\nfrom the far side of the slate and places the pieces of chalk and the\npiece of wax on the middle of the slate, and places the inverted tumbler\nover them. But while he is making a little heap of the chalks on the\nmiddle of the slate, before placing the tumbler in position, he also\ndraws a figure (or a number, as the case may be) that he thinks the\nsitter is most likely to choose. He draws this, of course, very rapidly\nand dexterously, and he arranges the chalks over it so as to conceal it.\nFurther, he has placed the piece of wax on the side of the heap which\nis nearest to himself. He now takes his place very carefully so that\nthe thread, the length of which has been well calculated, shall not be\ntightened too soon. The reader will now see that by withdrawing his\nbody from the table, Mr. Davey can finally cause the wax to move in\nthe opposite direction, i.e., away from himself, and through, so to speak,\nthe little group of chalk fragments, producing a movement in them\nalso. The tumbler is then lifted in excitement, usually by Mr. Davey,\nthe slate is inspected, and a figure discovered. In the meantime Mr.\nDavey gives a jerk to the thread, moves away from the table, and\ngathers the wax and thread once more into his pocket.\nThere are several minor details of Mr. Davey's performances which\nhardly need explaining. Thus many of the sitters describe the pieces\nof pencil or chalk as being worn at the conclusion of an experiment.\nUsually they would have been found equally worn at the beginning of\nthe experiment had the attention of the sitters been then called\nto them. Sometimes, indeed, they were not worn at the beginning,\nbut Mr. Davey then took care to substitute worn pieces before the\n\f276 Mr. R. Hodgson.\n\u2022writing was produced. There are several specific cases (Sittings I.,\nIX., and XIII.) where the pencil was found resting at the end of the\nmessage. These were in locked-slate experiments. Mr. Davey had\nchosen and placed the pencil so that when the slate (to be substituted)\nwas closed, the pencil did not move when the slate was shaken. When\nthe slate was carefully opened, right side up, the pencil was found\nwhere Mr. Davey had placed it.\nAfter the foregoing explanations I believe that the reader will find\nlittle difficulty in explaining to himself Mr. Davey's modus operandi in\nmost of the experiments in the series of sittings with him recorded in\nVol. IV. of our Proaedings. But I shall give the details of a few\nother cases where either possibly the reader may still be unable to see\nthe exact method used, or where a special additional trick was in\nvolved.\nIn Sitting III. occurs the following description :\u2014\nThe next experiment was the placing of 3 bits of coloured chalk on the\ntable, and of a clean slate (selected and placed by myself) over them. I put\nmy hand on the slate, Davey his on mine, and we joined contact. Again we\nheard the sound of writing, and when I lifted the slate there was written\n-large and neatly in the coloured chalks (three lines or so in each colour) this\nmessage :\u2014\"Don't you think I've done enough for you to-night I'm tired\nJoey.\" I noticed the chalks seemed worn, showing signs of work, just like\nthe little bit of pencil in the previous experiment.\nMr. Davey very rarely used the \" trick slate,\" but the case\n\u2022described above was. one instance of its use. The slate was neither\nselected nor placed by the sitter. Mr. Davey first placed some coloured\nnibs of chalk on the table just in front of the sitter. He then took\none of his own slates which the sitter had not touched, and apparently\nsponged both sides thoroughly. Mr. Davey himself then placed the\nslate over the pieces of chalk, and asked the sitter to place his hand\nupon the slate. The sitter then for the first time touched the slate.\nThe slate used in this case had a false flap, which fitted the frame. On\nthe surface of the slate itself, under this flap, was a prepared communi\ncation. The exterior surface of the flap resembled the exterior surface\nof the true slate. The interior surface of the flap was covered with a\npiece of blotting-paper which bore marks of use in the form of casual\nblots and lines, &c. On the table in close juxtaposition lay a pile of\nblotting-paper, the top of which was also marked by casual blots, &c.\nThis blotting-paper was there for the ostensible purpose of drying the\nslates. Mr. Davey took the slate with false flap uppermost, and sponged\nthe exterior surface of the flap. He then turned the slate over on top\nof the blotting-paper, and sponged the other surface of the slate. Ho\nthen lifted the slate and placed it above the chalks, leaving the false\n\fMr. Davey'a Imitations by Conjuring, itc. 277\nflap behind upon the pile of blotting-paper, but with the blotting-paper\nside of it uppermost. The sitter was watching the slate \"with all his\neyes,\" but, of course, saw nothing which it was undesirable that he\nshould see. \" The chalks seemed worn,\" as the sitter says, but then\nthe sitter did not examine the chalks beforehand, or he would have\nfound them equally worn then.\nThere are two reports of Sitting VII., and I may refer to an\nexperiment where the reports differ in a very important point. Mr.\nV.'s report is :\u2014\nThe medium tore off half a sheet of letter-paper bearing the address of\nhis house ; this he gummed to the surface of an ordinary slate, a fragment\nof lead pencil was put on the paper, and the slate then transferred beneath\nthe table-flap, and held by Mr. P. and the medium. Writing immediately\naudible. At our request the slate was exposed before it had ceased. To the\nbest of my remembrance the slate could not have been beneath the table-flap\nfor more than 20 seconds. On examination we found the following message\nwritten in a hand which bore a much greater resemblance to the medium's\nthan any of the others.\nMr. M. writes :\u2014\nMr. Pinnock asked if we could not get the writing on a piece of paper\ninstead of the slate. Mr. Davey said we might try, and thereupon tore a\nsheet of writing-paper into two, and pasted one half on to a slate by the four\ncorners ; ho cut off a small piece of black lead from the end of a pencil, put\nit on the paper and covered the slate with another slate. Writing was heard\nat once, and we separated the slates and found the paper written over\ndiagonally as in the case of the first slate. The paper was not, however,\nquite full, and it looked as if the slates were separated too soon, as the\nsentence was not finished. The writing was evidently written with the point\nof the pencil.\nThis experiment was actually \" led up to \" by Mr. Davey, who had\nalready prepared the message, and who substituted the slate containing\nthe prepared message by the two-single-slates method already described\n(p. 257). Mr. Davey also suggested that the slates should be examined\nbefore the sound as of writing had ceased.\nIn her report of Sitting XVI. Miss Symons describes one experi\nment as follows :\u2014\nHe took up 12 squares of paper, asked me to name any 12 animals I liked,\nwhose names he wrote on the 12 squares of paper. These were shuffled\ntogether, and I was asked to choose one, which I was to glance at and then\ninstantly to burn. Mr. Davey at the same time threw the other squares into\nthe fire. I next wrote the first and last letters of the animal I had chosen on\nanother piece of paper, this Mr. Davey burned in the gas, bared his arm and\nshowed us that there was nothing written there, rubbed the ashes of the\nburnt paper over the bare arm, and presently what looked like letters becamo-\nvery faintly visible. They did not, however, become sufficiently distinct to\nenable us to read them, and Mr. Davey said he would presently get the\n\f278 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nanimal's name written on a slate. . . . Before he left, Mr. Davey held a\ndate with me under the table, and asked that the name of the animal\nwritten on the slip of paper I had chosen should be written on the slate.\nWriting was heard, the slate brought up, and I found \"rhinoceros\"\u2014\nwrongly spelt\u2014in red chalk. This was correct, though how Mr. Davey\nknew, or by what means the word was written, I have no idea, for the slate\nappeared to me to be clean when we put it under the table.\nThis, though not on this occasion completely successful, is a very\noasy trick. Before the experiment, write on the arm, with a brush or\nn feather, in uric acid, the name of an animal (or a flower, or a country,\n(tc.) likely to be one of twelve chosen. Wait till it dries. There\nis then no visible trace upon the arm. When the sitter names an\nanimal, write, on the square of paper, the name that you have written\nupon your arm. Do the same with every piece of paper, no matter\nwhat animal the sitter names. The slip chosen afterwards by the\nsitter will necessarily contain the name written upon your arm. Rub\nthe ashes of this paper upon the arm, and the letters will \" stand out \"\nin the colour of the ash. I have performed this experiment myself\nsuccessfully two or three hours after writing the name upon my arm.\nThe word \" rhinoceros \" was already written on the slate when Mr.\nDavey placed it under the table, as Mrs. Sidgwick had good ground\nfor stating, for Mr. Davey wrote it openly in her presence and showed\nit to her while Miss Symons was out of the.room.\nThose who have read thus far, and who have taken pains to compare\nmy explanations not only with those accounts which I have re-quoted\nin this article, but with the reports as originally given in Vol. IV. of\nour Proceedings, will realise now, I trust, if they have not done so\npreviously, the extreme imperfection of those reports, and therefore the\ngreat unreliability of any testimony to the ordinary \" slate-writing \"\nperformances of professional mediums. The medium may leave the\nroom, he may withdraw a slate several times, he may separate slates\nplaced together on the table, and alter their respective positions, he\nmay turn slates over together, and yet not one of these circumstances\nmay appear in the report of the sitter. These points and others the\nstudent might easily have discovered for himself by comparing the\ndifferent reports given of the same sittings by the uninitiated witnesses,\nand yet these points are all of the most fundamental importance as\nregards the question of trickery. Thus in Sitting II. only one witness\nout of three refers to Mr. Davey's leaving the room, and only one\nwitness out of three mentions the withdrawals of the slate before the\nwriting was manifest. In Sitting IV. only one witness out of three\nrecords the separation of slates placed together on the table, Ac\nFurther, in Sitting II. only one witness out of three records a highly\nimportant incident (the sitters' writing down on slates the numbers of\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, iSjc. 279\nwhich they were thinking), which was specially brought about by Mr.\nDavey for the express purpose of making a substitution, and during\nwhich the substitution was actually made.\nYet here I must confess that while it is gratifying to learn that\nMr. Davey's labours have been so successful in producing the conviction\nthat his \" manifestations \" and those of certain professional mediums do\nactually belong to the same category, it is disappointing to find that\nthe chief object of at least my own Introduction to Mr. Davey's investi\ngation seems to have met with but little appreciation by Mr. Wallace\nand those whom he represents. I admitted that \" there are numerous\nrecords of 'psychographic' phenomena that have occurred with mediums\n(and also with Mr. Davey) which, as described, are inexplicable by\ntrickery,\" and I endeavoured to show \" how far such records might be\nmisdescriptions, and what were the chief causes of the misdescriptions.\"\nThe notes to the records were made for the purpose of showing to\ninvestigators some of the important misdescriptions that actually oc\ncurred, and that are therefore to be expected in such records. Further,\nthere were five sittings each of which was reported by more than one\nwitness, and opportunity was given to the student to discover for him\nself, by a comparison of different reports of the same sitting, numerous\nother instances of misdescription. The question of primary importance\nconcerns the value of human testimony under the circumstances in\nvolved. Why do we not accept such testimony? Because it is\ndemonstrably fallible in precisely those particular points where it must\nbe shown infallible before the phenomena can be accepted as super\nnormal. I have already briefly adverted to some of the instances of\nthis fallibility in the explanations which 1 have given of Mr. Davey's\nmethods, but it seems to me needful to further emphasise it in view of\nthe fact that Mr. Wallace has been able to entertain the idea that\nMr. Davey was a \"medium.\" My purpose will, I think, be sufficiently\nconserved if I refer to one or two additional striking cases of dis\ncrepancies between reports of the same sittings.\nIn Sitting I. a long message was obtained on the locked slate, but\nthe message was incomplete, ending \" We hope to.\" Mr. Davey ended\nthe message purposely in this way and afterwards \" led up to \" the\nrequest that the message might be concluded. In the meantime Mr.\nDavey had written the conclusion of the message on one of Mr. R.'s\nslates, which was lying on the table, writing downwards, ready for the\nexperiment.\nMr. R. writes as follows :\u2014\nI desired after this to have the writing on the double slate of Mr. Davey's\ncontinued at the point where it had been broken off, and obtained this result\non one of my slates which I held underneath the table and which began\nimmediately. \"We hope to see you again\u2014Joey.\" I was also anxious to\n\f280 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nknow what the VII signified as I have already said before. On the first\nattempt we got the answer\u2014\" good-bye Joey \"\u2014but we were more success\nful on again putting the question, the result being a distinct \" Septe \" ;\nwhether, as I have already said, it was intended for September I cannot tell.\nMr. L.'s account is :\u2014\nTho writing having stopped so abruptly, two ordinary slates were placed\nupon the table in the manner before described, and it was asked by Mr. It.\nthat the letter should be concluded. Within a period of 15 seconds from tho\ntime of asking such question and after completing the circle with our hands,\nthe words \"to see you again, Joey,\" were written.\nThe two slates were again placed in the same position as before, and Mr.\nR. having put an unimportant question, after the completion of the circle\nas beforo, I saw upon the slate \" Good-bye, Joey \" ; but on a second trial a\nscrawl was obtained which looked very mueh like \"Sept. Joey,\" but it was\nimpossible to say defmitely what it was intended for.\nIt is noteworthy that Mr. L. makes this experiment follow imme\ndiately after the loeked-slate message, and places tho \" tumbler \" trick\nlast, while Mr. R. makes it follow the \" tumbler \" trick, which he puts\nimmediately after the locked-slato experiment. 1 do not recall what Mr.\nDavey told me about his precise operations in connection with these\nwritings, but from my knowledge of his methods, aided by his note, I\ninfer that he cleaned the top of the slate, the underside of which was\nalready prepared with the conclusion of the message, that he placed\nthis slate under the table, turning it over in the process according to\nthe single-slate method described on p. 256. He then wrote \" Good\nbye, Joey,\" on the then under surface of the slate with his thimble-\npencil, brought the slate up and laid it upon the table, when tho words,\n\" hope to see you again, Joey,\" were manifest. These words were\nrubbed out, and this slate placed upon another slate, and both slates\ntogether placed under the table, being reversed in the process. He\nthen wrote \" Sept. Joey\" on the under surface of the bottom slate,\nbrought both slates together to the top of the table, and lifted the top\nslate, when the words \"Good-bye, Joey,\" appeared on the upper surface\nof the bottom slate. He rubbsd these out, put this slate upon the\nother, and placed them once more under the table, reversing them as\nhe did so, and then possibly, as though changing his mind, placed them\non top of the table again. When the top slate was removed, \" Sept.\nJoey \" appeared on the upper surface of the bottom slate.\nBut I wish to draw the reader's particular attention here, for a\nreason which will appear later, to the fact that one witness states that\nthe communication came upon a single slate held underneath the table\n(a statement which Mr. Davey confirms), and the other that it came\nbetween two slates placed on top of the table. Nor is this the only-\ninstance of a mistake of this kind in the reports. Comparing the\naccounts of the letter-paper incident which occurred in Sitting VII.,\n\fMr. Dtivei\/8 Imitations, by Conjuring, Sc. 281\nand which I have quoted on p. 277, it will be noticed that in one account\nthe experiment is described as having been made with a single slate\nheld underneath the table, in the other as having been made with two\nslates above the table. The experiment was actually made with two\nslates which were probably finally held under the table.\nAnother important discrepancy between the reports of Sitting VII.\noccurs in the case of the ordinary two-slates experiment. Mr. V., after\nreferring to the locked slate and the writing of a question therein, ifec.,\ndescribes experiments [a] and [6], and then proceeds to describe experi\nment [c] as follows :\u2014\nTwo ordinary slates taken, cleaned by us, but not marked, pieces of red\nand green chalk introduced between them, the slates then deposited in front\nof the medium in full view, and about four or five inches from the edge of\nthe table and from the medium's body ; the medium rested one of his hands\non the upper surface of the top slate, and my hand reposed on his.\nAfter a pause the sound of writing distinctly audible ; this continued for\nabout 15 seconds, then the medium remarked, \" What a pity I forgot to ask\nyou what colour you would have it in.\" Mr. M. suggested green ; sound\nof writing continued for about five seconds longer, then ceased. On the\nremoval of the top slate, the bottom slate was found to be completely\ncovered with writing. The writing ran in diagonal lines across the slate ;\nthe writing was upside down with respect to the medium ; the writing was\nfirm and distinct in character. The first three-quarters of the message were\nwritten in red, the last quarter in green.\nMr. M. is much more accurate in his account of this incident, and\nI include, in the quotation which I give, his reference to other\nexperiments which came between the beginning and the end of the\ntwo-slates experiment. There is no clue to the modus operandi, for\nthe uninitiated reader, in Mr. V.'s account, but there are very obvious\nclues, for any careful student of the series of reports, in Mr. M.'s\naccount. Mr. M. describes the locked slate, &c, ,fec, and then\nproceeds :\u2014\nMr. Davey then showed me some ordinary slates, in wooden frames.\nThese I helped him to wash and dry. We then took our seats round the\ntable. . . . Mr. Davey asked Mr. Pinnock to place the locked slate\nunder his (Mr. Pinnock's) coat and then button up the coat.\n[c] We now took three slates, on one of them we placed three fragments\nof crayon, two of which were red, the other green, we then covered up this\nslate with another and left them on the table in full view.\n[a] On the third slate we also put a piece of crayon and then held the\nslate underneath one flap of the table which we put up for the pur\npose. . . . We sat in this way talking and smoking for some time,\ntwenty minutes to half an hour I should say, nothing whatever occurring.\nAt last Mr. Davey asked me to change places with Mr. Pinnock. This I did\nand thus had one of my hands on the slate. Mr. Davey now said, that in\nthe manner usual at seances we would ask questions of an imaginary being ;\nu\n\f282 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nand he said, \" Are you going to do anything to-night, Joey 1 \" After a short\npause he repeated the question, and then I felt the slate vibrate as if being\nwritten on, and could hear a scratching noise ; we took the slate from under\nthe table-flap and saw the word \"yes\" written over Mr. V.'s initials, and\nI particularly noticed that the writing was towards Mr. Davey, and upside\ndown to him, and in all we saw afterwards this was the case.\n[b] I now asked a question as to the whereabout of a person at that time,\nnot knowing the answer myself ; we waited for some time without any result,\nwhen Mr. Davey asked me to again change places with Mr. Pinaock.\n[d, e, g, &c.] I did so, and Mr. Davey told Mr. Pinnock to place the locked\nslate on the table beside the two slates we had left face to face, and we also\nlifted the uppermost of these two slates and found the slates still quite clean,\nwith the three pieces of crayon between them. We again waited some time\nwith no results ; meantime, having a discussion as to mediumship of different\npeople, and then Mr. Davey asked if I were a medium. After a pause I\nheard vigorous scratchings on the two slates left face to face on the table and\non which Mr. Davey's arm was resting, his two hands being engaged, one in\nholding the slate under the table flap, the other in holding Mr. V.'s\nhand ; the scratching lasted roughly under ten seconds, and I expected to see\na dozen words or so, and was therefore amazed to discover, when the top slate\nwas lifted, that the underneath slate was covered with writing from corner to\ncorner, and also the writing was not straight across the slate, but was across\nit diagonally ; three-quarters of the writing was in red, the other quarter ht\ngreen, and no crayon teas left.\nNow, the reader will easily infer from Mr. M.'s account that the two\nslates were placed in position by Mr. Davey and were wrongly supposed\nby the sitters to have been taken from those cleaned by them some time\n\u2014not immediately\u2014previously. After studying the accounts of Sittings.\nIV., especially the reasoning by Mr. Padshah, and after considering that\nthe slates used were Mr. Davey's, the reader will also infer that the\nunder surface of the bottom slate was already covered with the writing\nafterwards found. He will then argue that if a series of movements,\nsuch as those described by Mr. Russell (see p. 264) could be completely\nomitted from the report of Mr. Padshah, they might also have occurred\nin Sitting VII., although they are not recorded in the reports of that\nsitting. But more instructive even than these clues in Mr. M.'s account\nto Mr. Davey's modus operandi, is the fact that Mr. V. describes the\nsteps of the experiment as though they came in immediate sequence i\nwhereas we learn from Mr. M. that about half an hour elapsed between\nthe first and last steps of the experiment, and that during this interval\nexperiments were being made with a single slate. These experiments\n[a] and [6] are described by Mr. V., but they are described as occurring\nbefore the commencement of [c].\nI shall give one more illustration of differences between reports of\nthe same sitting before proceeding to consider in detail those (slate-\nwriting) sittings which Mr. Wallace has mentioned as being, apparently.\n\fMr. Davey'a Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 283\nparticularly hard to explain. In his report of Sitting VII. Mr. V.\nwrites :\u2014\nAt the request of the medium, Mr. P. wrote a question in the book-slate\n(I shall call this slate A in future) ; he then locked it and pocketed the key.\nNeither Mr. M. nor I knew the nature of the question at the time. The slate\nwas left for some minutes upon the seat of an arm-chair, but was subsequently\ntransferred first to Mr. P.'s coat, and then to the table at which we sat.\nLater on, after recounting experiments with a single slate and with\ntwo slates, Mr. V. continues :\u2014\nThe medium and Mr. P. placed their hands upon slate A, which had\nremained in sight in front of the latter since the commencement of the\nseance. The sound of writing audible almost immediately. Mr. P. opened\nslate, and we found the question he had written, together with the accom\npanying answer.\nTurning now to Mr. M.'s account, we find that he also mentions\nthat Mr. Pinnock, at the beginning of the sitting, wrote a question in\nthe slate, locked it and kept the key. He says nothing, however, as to\nwhat was done with the slate at that time, but goes on to describe, as\nthe next events, the examination of the table, the cleaning of ordinary\nslates, seating themselves at the table, &c. He then writes : \" Mr.\nDavey asked Mr. Pinnock to place the locked slate under his (Mr. Pin-\nnock's) coat and then button up the coat.\" Then follows his description\nof the two-slates experiment, which I have quoted above (p. 282), on\nreference to which it will be seen that Mr. Pinnock placed the locked\nslate on the table before any writing had been obtained between the\ntwo single slates. After the writing between the two slates was obtained,\nthe locked-slate experiment was proceeded with.\nMr. Davey now put his hand on the locked slates which had been left\non the table since Mr. Pinnock took them from under his coat ; we heard\nscratching inside. ,\nPutting these accounts together, it is obvious where the opportunities\nfor substitution were given. B might have been substituted for A\nshortly after A was locked up and while it was resting on the arm\nchair as described by Mr. V., so that it was really B that Mr. P. placed\nin his pocket (a desirable place lest the sitter should think of examining\nit before A was re-substituted). The re-substitution of A was easy\nwhile the sitters were absorbed in the long message that appeared\nbetween the two slates.\nCompare, with these reports, those of Mr. R. and Mr. L. of the\nlocked-slate experiment in Sitting I. The first mention of this ex\nperiment by Mr. L. occurs after the experiments with the single slate\nand with the two slates together. He writes :\u2014\nMr. Davey then produced a \"locked slate,\" which I examined most\nminutely, and, as far as I was able to judge, the surfaces were genuine slate\nU 2\n\f284 Mr, R. Hodgson.\nand had not undergone any process of preparation which would aid him in\nobtaining writing. A small crumb of pencil was inserted, and the slate\nclosed and locked by Mr. R. The key was then given into my possession.\nWe then placed our hands in an exactly similar position as before, and Mr.\nR. having repeated the question, \" Will the Emperor of Germany live\nthrough the year ? \" I very soon heard the pencil travelling over the surface of\nthe slate. After the lapse of about four minutes the slate was carefully\nunlocked by Mr. R., and the pencil very much worn was found at the place\nwhere the writing ended.\nFrom this account it would seem that the first inspection of the\nlocked slate almost immediately preceded the production of the writing,\nbut it appears from Mr. R.'s account that the slate was inspected and\nlocked at the very beginning of the sitting, and was put by him in the\npocket of his coat. After describing the experiments with a single\nslate and with double slates, he continues :\u2014-\nThe next experiment was with Mr. Davey's closed slate. After it had\nbeen produced from my pocket we laid it on the table locked and with the\nsmall piece of pencil inside, joined hands as before and the question was put,\n\" Will the Emperor of Germany live through the present year?\" Imme\ndiately the writing began, exactly the same as on previous occasions, and\nwhen after the space of 4 minutes (about) I carefully unlocked the slate we\nfound the following wonderful message.\nIf the reader will compare these accounts with the accounts of the\nlocked-slate experiment in Sitting VII., and especially with that by Mr.\nM., he will at once surmise that the locked slate was produced from\nMr. R.'s pocket before the communication was obtained between the\ntwo slates in the preceding experiment, and that while the sitters were\nabsorbed in its contemplation Mr. Davey substituted B for A. But the\nimportant point to notice is not how the trick was done. The impor\ntant point is that just as we have seen from the reports of Sitting VII.\nthat a witness may describe the steps of the two-slates experiment as\nthough they occurred in immediate sequence, with no other experi\nments intervening, whereas in reality the last steps were separated\nfrom the first by an interval of half an hour, during which other ex\nperiments were made with a single ordinary slate, and the lacked slate\nalso claimed attention :\u2014so here we find, from the reports of Sitting I.,\nthat a witness may describe the steps of the locked-slate experiment as\noccurring in immediate sequence, with no other experiments intervening,\nwhereas in reality the last steps were separated from the first by an.\ninterval during which various experiments were made with a single slate\nand with two slates together.\nBearing in mind, then, these two special possibilities of error and\nalso the other possibilities of error to which I have drawn attention on\npp. 260, 263, 269, all of which are sufficiently demonstrated by comparing\nthe reports of tfte sitters themselves, let us now consider in detail the\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 285 ;\nreports of Sittings XI. and XII., which Mr. Wallace has particularly\nmentioned (Journal S.P.R., March, 1891) as needing explanation.\nThe report of the experiments in Sitting XI. is as follows :\u2014\u2022\nla] After I had finished examining the [locked] slate, Mr. Davey asked\nme to write in the slate any question I liked while he was absent from the\nroom. Picking up a piece of grey crayon, I wrote the following question :\n\"What is the specific gravity of platinum?\" and then having locked the\nslate and retained the key, I placed the former on the table and the latter in\nmy pocket.\nAfter the lapse of a few minutes I heard a distinct sound as of writing,\nand on being requested to unlock the slate I there discovered to my great\nsurprise the answer of my question : \" We don't know the specific gravity,\nJoey.\" The pencil with which it was written was a little piece which we had\nenclosed, and which would just rattle between the sides of the folded slate.\nHaving had my hands on the slate above the table, I can certify that the\nslate was not touched or tampered with during the time the writing was\ngoing on.\n[6] Next ; having taken an ordinary scholar's shtte and placed a fragment\nof red crayon upon it, Mr. Davey placed it under the flap of the table. I held\none side with my hand as before. I then heard the same sound as previously,\nand when the slate was placed on the table I found the following short\naddress distinctly written: \"Dear Mr. S ,\u2014The substitution dodge is\ngood ; the chemical is better, but you see by the writing the spirits know a\ntrick worth two of that. This medium is honest, and I am the only true\nJoey.\" The writing was in red crayon, and was in regular parallel straight\nlines.\n[c] Then, again, Mr. Davey requested me to place a small fragment of\nslate pencil in the lock slate, which latter had been previously cleansed with\nsponge by me. Respecting the method of closing the slate, &c, everything\nwas done as in thefirst instance ; the slate was locked, and I retained the key.\nAs soon as the sound of writing was over I picked the slate from off the\ntable, where it had been lying right under my eyes, unlocked it, and read as\nfollows : '' We are very pleased to be able to give you this writing under these\nconditions, because with your special knowledge upon the subject you can\nnegative the theory of antecedent preparation of this slate as advanced by\ncertain wiseacres to explain the mystery.\u2014' Joey.' \" The fact that the pencil\nwhen removed from the interior of the slate had diminished in size and showed\ndistinct traces of friction convinces me that it was the pencil and nothing else\nwhich produced the caligraphy. If the particles taken from the pencil by\nfriction did not go on the surface of the slate, where could they go 1\n[d] Lastly, as requested by Mr. Davey, I took a coin from my pocket\nwithout looking at it, placed it in an envelope and sealed it up. I am certain\nthat neither Mr. Davey nor myself knew anything about the coin. I then\nplaced it in the book-slate together with a piece of pencil, closed it as\npreviously and deposited it on the table ; and having placed my hands with\nthose of Mr. Davey on the upper surface of the slate, waited a short time. I\nthen unlocked the slate as requested, and to my intense amazement I found\nthe date of the coin written, by the side of the envelope containing it.\n\f286 Mr. R. Hodgson,\nThe seal and envelope (which I have now) remained intact-\nThis last feat astonished me more than the others, so utterly impossible\nand abnormal did it appear to me. I may also mention that everything\nwhich was used, including the cloth and sponge with which the slates were\ncleansed, were eagerly and thoroughly scrutinised by me, and I failed to\ndetect anything in the shape of mechanism of any kind.\nNow, that this report is very scanty and inadequate is obvious on\nthe face of it, and Mr. Davey assured me that there were other ex\nperiments tried of which no mention appears in the report. But I do\nnot propose to depend, for my explanations of this sitting, simply and\nmerely upon either my remembrance of conversations with Mr. Davey\nor my detailed knowledge of his methods. I am anxious that students\nshould learn how to interpret for themselves such accounts as these,\nand it seems to me that I can best achieve this result by pointing out,\nto begin with, some of the most obvious indications, which we find in\nthe report itself, of its deficiencies, afterwards amending the report as\nregards its most flagrant misdescriptions. We shall then easily see\nhow the tricks were performed.\nIn the first place, then, let us note that various important circum\nstances receive no mention whatever in the report. Mr. S. tells us\nthat after he locked the slate in experiment [o] he placed it on the\ntable, and \"after the lapse of a few minutes\" he heard \"a distinct\nsound as of writing,\" ,fee. But he tells us absolutely nothing as to\nwhat happened during this interval which he describes as a \" few\nminutes.\" He does not even mention the return of Mr. Davey to the\nroom. The locked slate might have been changed a hundred times for\nall that appears to the contrary in the sitter's account. What he\ncertifies is \" that the slate was not touched or tampered with during\nthe time the [sound as of] writing was going on.\" The reader may also\nnotice that the sitter does not say anything about enclosing a piece of\npencil when he first locked the slate, but it appears afterwards that\n\" the pencil with which it [the answer] was written was a little piece\nwhich we had enclosed.\" Here is another indication of circumstances\nomitted. When did \"we\" enclose it?\nConcerning experiment \\b\\ Mr. S. writes : \" Having taken an\nordinary scholar's slate and placed a fragment of red crayon on it, Mr.\nDavey placed it under the flap of the table. I held one side with my\nhand as before.\" Before ? when ? The sitter makes no mention of\nany previous experiment where he assisted in holding a slate under the\ntable, yet his remark here carries a clear implication that there was at\nleast one such previous experiment. Again, the sitter says that Mr.\nDavey placed the slate under the table, and he does not say that any ex\namination of it was made by himself. There is, therefore, nothing in his\ndescription of this experiment which conflicts with the supposition that\n\fMr. Davey\"s Imitations by Conjuring, i\u00a3-c. 287\nMr. Davey took a slate with the writing already on one side, slipped\nit under the table, turned it over, pressed it against the flap, and then\nasked the sitter to join in holding it against the table.\nSimilarly, in his account of experiment [c] there is no express\nstatement that conflicts with the supposition that the slate might have\nbeen changed during the interval between the sitter's examination of\nthe slate and the beginning of the sound as of writing. The sitter\nsays nothing as to the interval that elapsed between the time of his\ndepositing the slate, after locking it, on the table, and the conclusion\nof the sound as of writing, except the remark, \" where it had been\nlying right under my eyes,\" and he does not expressly say that it had\nbeen \" lying right under his eyes \" during the whole of the interval in\nquestion. The inference from his remark, comparing it with his account\nof experiment [o], is that what he meant was that the slate had been\n\"lying right under his eyes\" during \"the time the [sound as of]\nwriting was going on.\" Other experiments occupying, say, half an\nhour might have been in progress between the time of the sitter's\nlocking the slate and hearing the sound as of writing.\nNow, we have already seen that witnesses may make numerous\npositive and express statements which are entirely erroneous, the\nresult being ftiat if their descriptions are taken as correct, the\nphenomena which they describe are inexplicable by trickery. But,\ncuriously enough, in the report before us, the phenomena described in\nthe three first experiments mentioned by the sitter are perfectly\nexplicable by trickery without altering a single word of his accounts of\nthem. Only in his account of experiment [d], and scarcely in that, are the\ndetails narrated in such a way that, as described, trickery seems impossible.\nLet us now revise the report of these four experiments. We may\ndo this by consideration of the methods usually adopted by Mr. Davey\nas revealed in the whole series of sittings, and by consideration also of\nthe errors to which a witness is liable, as revealed by a comparison\nof the different reports given of the same sitting. We find, then, that\nMr. Davey usually began by giving the locked slate to the sitter to\nexamine, and possibly to write a question therein. He then tried\nexperiments with a single slate and with two slates together, and\nafterwards recurred to the locked slate. Observing this general order,\nI amend the report as follows, correcting, of course, by no means all\nof its fundamental misdescriptions ; but\u2014and I desire to lay very\nspecial emphasis on this fact\u2014the changes which I do make, excepting\nthe descriptions of the actual substitution of one slate for another, and\nthe doings of Mr. Davey while out of the room, are all warranted by a\ncomparison of the reports of those sittings where more than one in-\ndependent report was made. The additions which I make are in square\nbrackets, and the italicised parts explain how the tricks were done.\n\f288 Mr. R. Hodtfson.\n[a] After I had finished examining the slate, Mr. Davey asked me to write\nin the slate any question I liked while he was absent from the room.\nPicking up a piece of grey crayon, I wrote the following question : \" What\nis the specific gravity of platinum 1 \" and then having locked the slate and\nretained the key, I placed the former on the table and the latter in my\npocket.\n[When Mr. Davey returned to the room, he asked me to examine the\ntable carefully, which I did. It was an ordinary table, without any trick-\nmechanism of any sort. During this interval Mr. Davey substituted B for\nA. He then gave me some ordinary slates to wash and dry. During th is\ninterval Mr. Davey left the room, opened A and answered the question, and\nreturned and re-substituted A for B. Mr. Davey now took three slates.\n[b] On one of them (which had not been in the hands of the sitter, awl on\nthe under surface of which was the prepared message) he placed a fragment\nof red crayon. He then covered up this slate with another and left them on\nthe table in full view. On the third slate he also put a fragment of crayon\nand held it under the table against the flap and asked me to hold it on my\nside. We asked if we should get any phenomena, and after a short time the\nsound of writing was heard, and we looked at the slate and found the answer\n\" Yes.\" We then put our hands on the locked slate.]\n[a] After the lapse of a few minutes I heard a distinct sound as of writing,\nand on being requested to unlock the slate I there discovered to my great\nsurprise the answer of my question : \" We don't know the specific gravity,\nJoey.\" The pencil with which it was written was a little piece which we had\nenclosed, and which would just rattle between the sides of the folded slate.\nHaving had my hands on the slate above the table, I can certify that the\nslate was not touched or tampered with during the time the writing was\ngoing on.\n[c] Then, again. Mr. Davey requested me to place a small fragment of\nslate-pencil in the lock slate, which latter had been previously cleansed with\nsponge by me. Respecting the method of closing the slate, &c, everything\nwas done as in the first instance ; the slate was locked, and I retained the\nkey.\n[In the meantime Mr. Davey lifted the top slate of the two on the table,\nbut there was no writing there. He reversed the positioits of the two slates so\ntltat the slate with the message on the under surface was now on top. Mr.\nDavey then took these two slates and placed them under the flap of the table,\nreversing them together as he did so.]\n[6] I held one side with my hand as before. I then heard the same sound\nas previously, and when the slate was placed on the table I found the following\nshort address distinctly written : \"Dear Mr. S ,\u2014The substitution dodge\nis good ; the chemical is better, but you see by the writing the spirits know\na trick worth two of that. This medium is honest, and I am the only true\nJoey.\" The writing was in red crayon, and was in regular parallel straight\nlines.\n[ffliile the sitter was examiidng this message Mr. Davey substitided B for\nA. Mr. Davey now put his hands on the locked slate. Very soon the\nsound of writing began.]\n[c] As soon as the sound of writing was over, I picked the slate from off\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c, 289\nthe table, where it had been lying right under my eyes, unlocked it, and read\nas follows : \" Wo are very pleased to be able to give you this writing under\nthese conditions, because with your special knowledge upon the subject you\ncan negative the theory of antecedent preparation of this slate as advanced by\ncertain wiseacres to explain the mystery.\u2014' Joey.' \" The fact that the pencil\nwhen removed from the interior of the slate had diminished in size and showed\ndistinct traces of friction convinces me that it was the pencil and nothing else\nwhich produced the caligraphy. If the particles taken from the pencil by\nfriction did not go on the surface of the slate, where could they go !\n[W7uie the sitter was copging the communication Mr. Davey left the room\nand placed the coin in envelope, aud envelope in slate A, and wrote date (see\np. 271) and returned.]\n[d] Lastly, as requested by Mr. Davey, I took a coin from my pocket\nwithout looking at it, placed it in an envelope and sealed it up. I am certain\nthat neither Mr. Davey nor myself knew anything about the coin. I then\nplaced it in the book-slate together with a piece of pencil, closed it as previously\nand deposited it on the table.\n[Mr. D. showed and explained to me a means commonly employed in\nproducing slate-writing by fraud. MHiile the sitter was examining the trick\ndate, Mr. Davey substituted A for B. I then took the locked slate.]\nAnd having placed my hands with those of Mr. Davey on the upper surface\nof the slate, waited a short time. I then unlocked the slate as requested, and\nto my intense amazement I found the date of the coin written, by the side of\nthe envelope containing it.\nThe reader now will surely need no further enlightenment as to the\ndetails of events in Sitting XII., or indeed in any other sitting of\nthe series, and will, I trust, be disposed to think, with Mrs. Sidgwick\nand myself, that the most startling result of Mr. Davey's investigation\nis not the wonder of the tricks themselves, but the extreme unreliability\nof the accounts given of them by uninitiated witnesses. And we should\nremember further that these accounts probably represent the most\naccurate reports, as a whole, of such performances, ever brought to\ngether in a series. For the witnesses knew beforehand that they were\nexpected to write out accounts of what occurred, and more important\nstill, the reports were written within two or three days after the\nsittings. And I may here also refer the reader to my remarks in\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., pp. 396-399, concerning the disadvantages\nunder which Mr. Davey laboured as compared with the ordinary pro\nfessional medium.\nThe reader may now ask how far his knowledge of Mr. Davey's\nmethods may prevent him from being imposed upon by fraudulent\nmediums. Possibly not very much. Frequent observation and practice\nof them, however, would no doubt be of great assistance. Surreptitious\nwriting on slates held under the table, the substitution, openly made,\nin the case of slates lying on the table, and the manipulations of two\nslates where the writing is originally on the under surface of the lower\n\f290 Mr. It. Hodgson.\nslate, and eventually is found on the upper surface of the lower slate,\nare, I have no doubt, in frequent use by fraudulent mediums. Eglinton\nwas apparently in the habit of using all these methods. Mr. Davey\npurchased some of his devices from an individual who gave him to\nunderstand that they had been procured from an American medium.\nThe author of Revelations of a Sjririt-Medium enumerates eight different\nmethods of apparently producing \"independent slate-writing\" without\nthe help of a confederate. The most important of these is a variation\nof the two-slates experiment combined with the trick-reading of pellets,\nand as I have reports in my possession written by a member of our\nSociety who witnessed this general method in the case of two well-\nknown American mediums, Watkins and W. A. Mansfield, I quote\nwhat the author of the book says (pp. 124-126) about this trick.\nAnother feat that is astonishing and convincing is accomplished with two\nclean slates. They are thoroughly cleaned and laid side by side upon a table,\non one side of which sits the \"sitter,\" and opposite him the \"medium.\" The\n\"sitter\" is now furnished with a small square of soft white paper and re\nquested to write the name of some deceased friend or relative, and with it a\nquestion. This being done he is requested to fold it up small, similar to the\nphysician's powder papers. The \"medium\" has a blank one, folded in the\nsame way and palmed between the index and middle finger of the right hand.\nWhen the \"sitter\" has folded his pellet, the \"medium\" reaches forth his\nright hand and takes it between the thumb and index finger and carries it to\nhis forehead. While raising the hand to the head, he slips the written pellet\ndown and the blank one in view. After holding it to his forehead a few\nseconds he requests the \" sitter \" to take it and hold it against his own fore\nhead for a moment. Of course the \"sitter\" gets the blank pellet and the\n\" medium's \" hand drops to his lap. He now opens the pellet and reads it.\nWe will say it reads : \"John Smith. Will my business succeed 1 George.\"\nHaving read it and palmed it again, he now requests to hold the pellet to\nhis forehead again. He effects the change and says to the \" sitter \" : \" You\nnow hold the pellet in your left hand and I will write the answer.\"\nThis time the \"sitter\" has the pellet he wrote, and holds it while the\n\" medium\" takes up a slate, and leaning well back, holds the slate with his\nleft hand and body, and writes with the right hand in such a position that\nthe \"sitter\" cannot see the writing. He writes :\n\" Dear George, \u2014Your business is sure to succeed beyond your expecta\ntions. John Smith.\"\nHe now states to the \"sitter\" that he does not feel at all sure that he has\nwritten the correct answer, and reads aloud :\n\" The papers will never be found. Harry White.\"\nOf course it is not an answer to the question, and the \" sitter\" so states.\nThe \"medium\" requests that he open the pellet and see if it is plainly\nwritten, with no omission of words.\nWhile he is doing so the slate is deftly turned the other side up. When\nthe sitter reports that the question is properly and plainly written, the\n\"medium \" apparently rubs off the line of writing and lays the slate on the\ntable, writing underneath. He now announces that he will let the spirits do\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 291\ntheir own writing, and putting the other slate on top of the one containing\nthe writing lays his hands on top of the slate a few seconds, when he opens\nthem, and of course there is no writing.\nHe now states that he does not believe he can get anything\u2014but, wait,\nhe says, we will put the pellet inside\u2014(hat may help them.\nThe pellet is placed on the blank slate and the one containing the writing\nlaid on top. Now the writing is between the slates. In picking up the two\nslates together, he turns them over, and the writing is on the bottom slate.\nHe now allows the \"sitter \" to hold the slates alone, and indicates when to\nopen them. They are opened, and much astonishment created by the pointed\nanswer to the question inside the pellet.\nIt is obvious that there may be many variations of this trick. In\nthe sittings with Watkins and Mansfield, accounts of which were\nwritten by Mr. John F. Brown, an Associate Member of the American\nBranch, each of the sitters (three at one sitting and two at the other)\nwrote several questions on slips of paper afterwards crumpled or folded\ninto pellets. Some of the medium's surreptitious dealings with their\npellets were observed by the sitters. Mr. Brown's account of the two-\n\u2022 slates incident at the sitting with Watkins is as follows :\u2014\nWatkins \" gave the name of George Hall, and soon commenced to write\nrapidly, covering one side of the slate, then he turned the slate over on his\narm so that the writing could not be seen, and wrote a few lines more. He\nsaid we had better copy the messages as it would be more interesting for us\nto have them to refer to. A. took pencil and paper, and Watkins read slowly\nthe following communication. . . . The side of the slate containing the\nsignature was turned towards us without any concealment ; the opposite side\nwas kept from our view. After he had finished reading, and while we were\nlooking at the copy, Watkins erased the part we had seen, then turned the\nslate end for end, rubbed the sponge again over the same side and put the\nslate on the table with writing on its under side. . . . Not long after the\nGeorge Hall message, a second attempt was made to get independent writing,\na first attempt having been unsuccessful. The previous attempt was shortly\nbefore the first message, and its lack of success gave Watkins the excuse for\nwriting himself. A bit of pencil was now laid on the top of a clean slate and\nthe slate with the writing already on it lifted from the tablo and placed upon\nthe other. Watkins then took hold of them both, waved them in the air,\nand, as he brought them back, turned them over so that the slate now under\nneath had writing on the upper side. All this was distinctly followed by us\nboth, and we were looking for writing just where it appeared.\"\nThe writing that appeared, as Mr. Brown points out, was doubtless\nwhat Watkins had written when he was pretending to write the first\npart of the George Hall message ; and when he pretended to read the\nGeorge Hall message from the slate he \" made it up \" as he proceeded\nuntil he turned the slate over.\nI witnessed yet other slight variations at a sitting with a Mrs.\nGillett. Under pretence of \" magnetising \" the pellets prepared by the\nsitter, or folding them more tightly, she substitutes a pellet of her own\n\f292 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nfor brie of the sitter's. Reading the sitter's pellet below the table, she\nwrites the answer on one of her own slates, a pile of which, out of the\nsitter's view, she keeps on a chair by her side. She then takes a second\nslate, places it on the table, and sponges and dries both sides, after\nwhich she takes the first slate, and turning the side upon which she\nhas written towards herself, rubs it in several places with a dry cloth\nor the ends of her fingers as though cleaning it. She then places it,\nwriting downward, on the other slate on the table, and sponges and\ndries the upper surface of it. She then pretends to take one of the\npellets on the table and put it between the two slates. What she does,\nhowever, is to bring the pellet up from below the table, take another\nof the sitter's pellets on the table into her hand, and place the pellet\nwhich she has brought up from below the table between the slates,\nkeeping in her hand the pellet just taken from the top of the table.\nThe final step is to place a rubber band round both slates, in doing\nwhich she turns both slates over together. She professes to get the\nwriting without the use of any chalk or pencil. Some of her slates\nare prepared beforehand with messages or drawings. More interesting,\nperhaps, because of its boldness, is her method of producing writing on\nthe sitter's own slates. Under pretence of \" magnetising \" these she\ncleans them several times, rubs them with her hands, stands them up\non end together, and while they are in this position between herself and\nthe sitter she writes with one hand on the slate-side nearest to herself,\nholding the slates erect with the other hand. Later on, she lays both\nslates together flat on the table again, the writing being on the under\nmost surface. She then sponges the upper surface of the top slate,\nturns it over, and sponges its other surface. She next withdraws the\nbottom slate, places it on top and sponges its top surface, keeping it*\nunder surface carefully concealed. The final step, the reversal, is made,\nas in the other case, with the help of the rubber band. Mrs. Gillett has\nprobably other methods also. Those which I have described were all\nthat I witnessed at my single sitting with her.\nIn many records which have been written of experiences with\n\" pellet mediums,\" the writers affirm that the medium never touched\ntheir pellets. In the case of such records we are fully justified in\napplying our general conclusions, drawn from a consideration of the\nerrors made by sitters with Mr. Davey, although Mr. Davey did not,\nat any of the sittings reported, use the \"pellet\" device. If a bond\nfide witness can report with confidence that he held his hands on the\nslate and watched it continuously during the experiment, when in\nreality he completely forgot about it for an appreciable interval during*\nwhich it was manipulated by the \" medium,\" he can equally report that\nhe watched his pellets the whole time, and that they were not touched\nor tampered with by the medium, although as a matter of fact the\n\fMr. Dave,]\/8 Imitations by Conjuring, iL-c. 293\nmedium did touch them, and did substitute one pellet for another. A\ngood instance of this has been brought to my recollection by the\nfollowing memorandum, which I have just found among my notes :\u2014\nOctober 8th, 1888.\nOn Saturday morning, October 6th, Mrs. [Q.] called, and during the\nconversation referred to the medium Watkins, and a conversation we had\nhad concerning him the previous week. She had then been profoundly\ninfluenced by sittings which she had with him, and had been most strenuous\nin denying that Watkins touched the pellets in any way, although admitting\nthat Watkins had rolled up one piece of jMiper as specimen, and left it on the\ntable, and she was unable to say what had afterwards become of it. She had\nalso been positive that Watkins did not tamper with the slates which she\nwas holding.\nOn Saturday morning Mrs. [Q.] told me that since leaving me the previous\nweek she had recalled that twice, at least, Watkins had touched the pellets,\nonce when he moved one pellet aside, saying ', this is mine,\" and on another\noccasion when he took up a pellet and asked Jier to pinch it up a little\nsmaller.\nLapse of memory again, we must note, rather than mal-observation.\nSimilarly, Mr. Padshah originally scouted the suggestion that he had\nlost perception of the locked slate, but when I assured him positively\nthat he had lost perception of it, he was finally able to discover, in a\ndim recess of memory, on its way to oblivion, the occasion of the loss.\nAnd Mr. Padshah's report was written immediately after the sitting.\nWhen we reflect on circumstances like these, how manifestly absurd\nappears the reliance which so many Spiritualists place upon reports of\n\" psychographic \" and kindred phenomena, where the lapse from memory\nof possibly a single apparently trivial detail vitiates the whole record of\nthe uninitiated witness.\nSlade also uses the two-slates method, as appears from the following\naccount of a sitting which I had with him in February, 1891 :\u2014\nFebruary 10th, 1891.\nSitting with Slade, 11 a.m., February 3rd, at 229, East 14th-street, New\nYork, with Mr. Z.\nSecond room\u2014simple table with two leaves\u2014large Pembroke. On\nfurther side of table was a small table close to the large table and close to\nthe wall, with a cloth over it hanging down. [The accompanying rough\ndiagram will illustrate the positions.]\n\f204 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nSMALL TABLk.\nA.\nSLADE. Mr. Z.\nR. H.\nSlade took two slates from the little table, upon which there were four, and\nshowed them to us. He turned them oyer and let us turn them over\u2014\nthey were clean. He then replaced them on the small table, and sug\ngested trying to get \"raps.\" He asked if Mr. Davis was present\u2014three\nraps. .1 ust before this he sat somewhat facing me, with right leg visible and\nleft leg partly so, saying, \"Notice my position.\" Almost immediately,\nhowever, he turned square towards the table and his left leg disappeared\nfrom view entirely. The raps, which continued for some time\u2014two or three\nminutes\u2014might easily have been produced by his foot. All our hands were\ntogether upon the table.\nSlade then took one of the replaced slates from the side table, put a piece\nof pencil on it (he had a box full of small fragments on the table), and held\nit with his right hand under the table for a short time. He did not keep the\nslate close to the table. No result. He then replaced the slate on the\ntable, and then took from the side table one of the two slates which we had\nnot inspected (the surface of which was much newer looking), and placed\nit on top of the slate No. 1. Then seizing both slates together with his left\nhand, he turned them over and laid them on the right arm of Mr. Z.,\nslanting away from me. Almost directly the sound as of writing was heard.\nBlade's fingers were concealed behind the slate, but I observed the tendons\nworking in his wrist.\nThe message was an ordinary general statement signed by the name\nDavis. The writing, of course, was already on the under surface of slate\nNo. 3 when Slade took it from the side table.\nThen Slade took the clean slate and held it under the table\u2014then said,\n\" They're taking it away from me,\" and stooped and pressed up against the\ntable as though his arm was being drawn under. Half of the slate then\nbecame visible [at A] facing me to the right, then disappeared, and shortly\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, dr. 295\nafter struck me at the lower part of my waistcoat and fell to the floor. All\nthis might easily have been done by Slade with his feet.\nHe placed the slate on the table again and turned it over. It was clean.\nThen he took it in his left hand, and stooped down somewhat to the left. I\nthen heard a sound as of a slate slipping to the floor, and conjectured from\nthe position of the upper part of his left arm that he was substituting the\nslate which we had just seen to be clean for slate No. 6, which was probably\nout of sight and leaning against the leg of the little table. (See The Seybert\nCommission on Spiritualism, p. 74.) In making the substitution I suppose\nthat one of the slates slipped on the floor. However, he brought this slate\n(No. 5) to the top of the table, took No. 2 or 4 (I am not sure which) and\nplaced No. 5 on top of it. Then seizing both slates together with his right\nhand, he turned them over and laid them on my left arm slanting away from\nme and away from Mr. Z. Almost immediately the sound as of writing\nbegan\u2014but the slates slid along my arm slightly, bringing Slade's fingers in\ngentle contact with my arm, and I could feel the motion of a finger or\nfingers moving backwards and forwards. Slade also noticed the contact, and\ndrew the slates up further so that his hand did not touch my arm.\nThe writing was a general kind of message, signed by T. Z.\u2014the name of\nMr. Z.'s father,\u2014but as Mr. Z., at a sitting ten days before, had been\nspecially asked by Slade what his father's name was, there was no test. The\ntwo writings were evidently by the same hand.\nAfter this, Slade asked me to write a question on the side of a slate\n(No. 2 or 4) remote from himself. I wrote, \" Fred, will you give me a test\nif you are here ? \"\nSlade took the slate in his right hand with the question on the under\nsurface and held it under the table, not close to the leaf. Almost imme\ndiately the slate rubbed past my left knee, suggesting that Slade was turning\nthe slate over. I then observed him furtively looking downwards, and he\nshortly asked me if I had asked two questions. I replied, No. After\nwaiting a little longer, he said that he felt that there was no influence\npresent\u2014the power, he thought, was exhausted, and he could generally tell\nwhen it left him. He thought it was no use sitting any longer. He suggested\nthat I should have another sitting soon, alone.\n(Mr. Z. thought the writing between the slates remarkable, and had no\nidea whatever of the trick movements, &c, made by Slade. I explained the\ndetails to him immediately after we left.)\nThere remained to ascertain the truth of my conjecture concerning slate\nNo. 5. I requested permission to thoroughly examine the large table, and\nliegan by turning it completely over to my right, so that I could see the corner\nwhere I supposed the fifth slate to be. As I did this, Slade carelessly stooped\ndown, picked up the fifth slate from the floor, close to the foot of the small\ntable, and laid it by the other slates on the table.\nFurther, I have proof that Mr. Davey's general methods are easily\ndiscoverable from the reports themselves by persons who have paid\nspecial attention to the production of such phenomena by trickery.\nAbout a year ago I became acquainted with a Mr. W. S. Davis, of New-\nYork, a printer by profession, who was making himself familiar with\n\f29G Mr. R. Hodgson.\nthe methods used by fraudulent mediums in rope-tying, slate-writing,\nmaterialisation, and other \" physical phenomena.\" I requested him to\nread the accounts of the sittings with Mr. Davey and write me a\ndescription of the methods which he supposed Mr. Davey used. His\ndescriptions were practically correct throughout, and indeed he gave\nadditional variations of some of the methods. The only cases where\nthe reports failed to give him sufficient clues were the book incidents,\nwhere the communication was prepared beforehand and the book was\n\" forced.\" Mr. Davis himself has given some sittings which have been\nregarded as specially remarkable by various Spiritualists of New York\nand Brooklyn, and brief accounts of these have appeared in some\nSpiritualistic papers. Mr. Davis informs me that he never claimed\nthat he was assisted in any of his performances by \" departed spirits,\"\nand as a matter of fact, they were all due to trickery, and he has\nexplained to me his methods in detail. It may be interesting to compare\nthe reports given by \" Spiritualists \" of a sitting with Mr. Davis with\nhis account of what actually occurred. But I shall first give the\nexplanation of Mr. Davey's \"materialisation\" seance which has been\nfurnished by Mr. Munro, who assisted Mr. Davey, or rather, I should\nsay, actually produced the phenomena.\nThe following is the report by Mr. R. of the sitting for materiali\nsation :\u2014\nOn Thursday evening, the 7th October, 1886, I was present at a seance\nheld by Mr. Davey, at his house. There were in all eight persons, myself\nincluded. We took our seats at 7.30 p.m., round an ordinary dining-room\ntable (in the dining-room of the house), which, at Mr. Davey's request, we\nexamined carefully, as also any other objects in the room which demanded\nour attention. The door of the room was locked, and I placed the key in my\npocket, it was also sealed with a slip of gummed paper ; the gas was then\nturned out, so that we were left in darkness. A musical box was wound up,\nand set to play an air, with the object, as I suppose, to enliven the proceedings !\nI held Mr. Davey's right hand, his left was held by Mrs. [J.}; the rest\njoined hands, so that during the seance a continual chain was formed which\nwas maintained the whole time. After we had remained some time thus,\nvarious noises as of a shuffling of feet, &c., were heard in different parts of the\nroom, and I distinctly felt something grasp my right foot ; almost immediately\nI was touched on the forehead by a cold hand, which, at Mr. Davey's request,\nalso touched those that wished it. The musical box was lifted, and although\nit was dark I fancied I saw it, surrounded by a pale light, descend through the\nair ; it certainly struck me lightly on the side of the head, then it was again\nraised, and deposited on the table.\nThe hand which touched me was cold and clammy ; it evidently belonged\nto a most courteous and obliging spirit, for it did exactly what we desired ! and\nat my wishing to feel the full palm on the back of my head (so as to ascertain its\nshape and size) it rested there for fully three seconds ; it was, however, a\nsomewhat weird experience ! Various raps were now heard, a gong sounded\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 297\nbehind my back, and we were told by Mr. Davey to pay attention, as some\nthing wonderful was about to take place. Faintly, but gradually growing more\ndistinct, a bluish white light appeared hovering about our heads ; it gradually\ndeveloped more and more till at length we beheld what we were told was the\nhead of a woman. This apparition was frightful in its ugliness, but so distinct\nthat everyone could see it. The features were distinct, the cheek bones\nprominent, the nose aquiline, a kind of hood covered the head, and the whole\nresembled the head of a mummy. After favouring those of the company\nwho wished to see its full face by turning towards them, it gradually vanished\niu our presence. The next spirit form was more wonderful still ; a thin streak\nof light appeared behind Mr. Davey, vanished, appeared again in. another\npart of the room, and by degrees developed into the figure of a man. The\nextremities were hidden in a kind of mist, but the arms, shoulders, and head\nwere visible. The figure was that of an Oriental, a thick black beard covered\nhis face, his head was surrounded by a turban ; in his hands he carried a book\nwhich he occasionally held above his head, glancing now and then from under\nneath it. The face came once so near to me that it appeared to be only two\nfeet from mine. I thus could examine it closely. The eyes were stony and\nfixed and never moved once. The complexion was not dusky, but very white ;\nthe expression was vacant and listless. After remaining in the room for a few\nseconds, or rather a minute, the apparition gradually rose, and appeared to\npass clean through the ceiling, brushing it audibly as it passed through. The\nseance here terminated ; the gas was turned on again, and everything appeared\nthe same as when we first sat down ; the door was unlocked, the seal being\nfound intact. I will mention that during the whole of the seance I held Mr.\nDavey's right hand, with but one exception, when it was found necessary for\nhim to light the gas to see to wind up the musical box, as it had stopped\nplaying. Nothing was prepared beforehand ; the stance was quite casual ; we\ncould have sat in any room we wished, and we had full liberty to examine\neverything in tho room, even tb the contents of Mr. Davey's pockets, which\nwere emptied (before beginning the s6ance) by him on the table before our\neyes !\nOctober 8th, 1886. John H. R.\nMr. Munro's Account.\nAlthough Mr. Davey was kind enough to instruct me in the methods of\nhis slate-writing, I was not present at any of the sittings described in Vol. IV.\nof the Proceedings, with the single exception of the materialisation seance,\nwhich is the only one published in which confederacy was employed.\nThe explanation which I am about to give of that seance may be of in\nterest as indicating how much or, I should rather say, how little, accounts of\nsuch phenomena correspond with the facts which actually occur. And the\nsitting for materialisation is eminently adapted for this purpose, inasmuch\nas the accounts were written so very soon after the sitting ended, two of\nthem at least having been completed on the same evening. At the same\ntime I should like to remind the reader that any explanation I can give of\ntho phenomena can be but partial. I can only inform him of the mere\ntnechameal processes which were employed. A full explanation would involve\na description of the mental attitude of the sitters and of every word and ges\nture of the medium whereby that mental state was altered. This I canned\nZ\n\f298 Mr. R. Hodgson.\ndescribe, and yet it is of infinitely greater importance than any of the tricks\nand devices used in the manufacture of the spirit forms. The latter might\nhave been produced by a host of other methods, and the method actually\nemployed does not appear to me to be a matter of much consequence. It is\nonly for the reason stated above that I consider its publication of any value.\nWith slate-writing seances it is quite different, for in them the mechanical\nprocesses\u2014the mere \"conjuring\"\u2014which can be used are necessarily very\nlimited. But when we darken the room and keep the investigators in\nignorance of what they are to observe, the possibilities for trickery are\ninfinitely increased, whilst the control which the medium must exercise over\nthe thoughts and emotions of his sitters need not be so great. It is not,\ntherefore, surprising that Mr. Davey himself introduced the accounts of the\nsittings for materialisation with a sort of half apology, seeing that the testi\nmony for such phenomena is and must be so much inferior to that for slate-\nwriting. To myself it is even surprising that any explanation should have\nbeen called for in the case of a seance where the facilities for deception were\nso great, and it is almost incredible that an investigator of Mr. Wallace's\nexperience should regard it as of equal or even greater importance than the\nslate-writing experiments. Considering the sensational nature of the phe\nnomena observed, it is not surprising that the accounts of this sitting show\nan even greater discrepancy with fact than do those of the slate-writing\nseances, and I think it will be well to indicate first of all a few of the more\nimportant errors.\nIn the first place, the seance, so far from being the casual affair which Mr.\nB. supposed, had, in fact, been carefully arranged beforehand. I had\nbeen staying with Mr. Davey for several days before the sitting, and we had\ndiscussed the details of the materialisation process, and even rehearsed it\nthrough, the night before it was given. Mr. Davey had also given a similar\nseance in the spring of the same year.\nIn the second place, the locking and sealing of the door, so carefully\nrecorded in all three accounts, was by no means so well calculated to prevent\nthe entrance of agencies from without as the reporters appear to have\nimagined. The process of \"locking\" the door, which was performed by Mr.\nDavey himself, although he subsequently gave the key to Mr. R. , consisted\nin first locking and then unlocking it. Sealing a door with a piece of\ngummed paper is now a well-known trick. The gummed paper, if properly\nadjusted, adheres firmly to the door when it is opened, and, when it is again\nshut, presents all the appearances of never having been moved. The\ninteresting part about the sealing in this case is that the paper was not\nproperly adjusted, and at the end of the seance, Mr. Davey, noticing that\nthe gummed paper had fallen down on to the ground, hastily stuck it back\nin its place and called Mr. R.'s attention to the fact that the door was still\nsealed\u2014a fact to which he and the other sitters readily gave their testimony.\nThe third point to which I would call especial attention is the exami\nnation of the room, with which every one of the three reporters was quite\nsatisfied, Mrs. J. even going so far as to state \" we searched every article of\nfurniture.\" In spite of this positive statement, the examination was im\nperfectly performed, for in that cupboard beneath the bookstand, which\nwas situated furthest from the door, were concealed a gong and several other\nappliances, including the female spirit herself. Mr. Davey showed his\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 299\nsitters that the other cupboard was empty, but diverted their attention from\nthis one so skilfully, that they were afterwards convinced that they had\nexamined it also.\nI will now describe what took place at the seance, step by stop so far as\nI can remember it.\nIt had been arranged to hold the meeting in the dining-room, and Mr.\nR.'s statement, \" we could have sat in any room we pleased,\" is not correct.\nMr. Davey did, indeed, I believe, offer his sitters their choice of rooms.\nBut had they selected any other room (and there were only two others\nwhich could conveniently have been used for the purpose) he could easily\nhave found some excuse for rejecting it in favour of the dining-room. There\nwas no peculiar advantage in this room. It was selected chiefly on account\nof its size, and because it was not overcrowded with furniture. At the same\ntime the cupboard behind the medium's chair was conveniently situated.\nWith regard to the sitters, four had been expected. The arrival of Mrs.\nJ. and Miss W. was, as Mrs. J. remarks, quite unexpected. Mr. R. cer\ntainly intended to be present, but I am not sure whether he anticipated a\nseance. On their entrance into the dining-room, free leave was given the\nsitters to search every article of furniture, and I think the search was\npretty well performed until it came to the cupboard under the bookshelf.\nFrom it Mr. Davey diverted attention by emptying out his pockets before\nhis audience\u2014a proceeding which they did not fail to remember as a con\nclusive proof of the completeness of their search.\nMr. Davey now \" locked \" the door in the manner already described and\nthe gas was turned down. At the same moment I, who had by this time\nfound my way into the passage, and could hear everything which was taking\nplace in the room, turned down the gas outside, in order that no light might\nenter the room when the time for my own entry should arrive. A large\nmusical box was then started, not, however, as Mr. R. supposed, \" to enliven\nthe proceedings,\" but that it might help with Mr. Davey's shuffling of feet\nto cover any noise which I might make in entering the room.\nWINDOW.\nx X\nTABLE.\nX\nMre. J. Mr. K.\nMr. D.\nx 2\n\f300 Mr, R. Hodgson.\nI must now explain that Mr. Davey sat at the end of the table with his\nhack turned towards the bookshelf and with the door on his left. Mr. R.\nwas on the right, Mrs. J. on the left of the \"medium,\" the other sitters,\nbeing seated on either side of the table nearer to the window. Having put\nout the gas in the passage I opened the door very slowly and came in\nbarefooted, closing the door behind me as noiselessly as I could. In so doing\nI will not be certain that I was not responsible for one or two of the very\nconclusive spirit-raps mentioned in the reports. I now went up to behind\nMr. Davey's chair, and, after tapping him on the back to indicate my safe\narrival, proceeded to raise the musical box and wave it to and fro above the\nheads of the sitters, and to make raps in different parts of the room.\nThroughout the seance I maintained a position behind Mr. Davey's chair,\nnever advancing at any time in the direction of the window. The knocks at\nthe far end of the room and on the ceiling were made with a long stick which\nI had brought in with me. Touching the sitters on the face, feet, or hands\nwas of course easily managed, and, inasmuch as I had rolled up my sleeves\nand held my whole hand and forearm in a jug of cold water before coming in,\nMr. R.'s description of the cold clammy hand which touched him was not\npurely imaginative.\nI next opened the cupboard beneath the bookshelf behind and to the left\nof the medium. It contained the gong, which I sounded for some minutes,\nand also the first spirit-form, which I afterwards divested of the black cloth\nwith which it was draped. This spirit is graphically described by Mr. R.\nas \"an apparition frightful in its ugliness, with cheekbones prominent and\nnose aquiline, the whole resembling the head of a mummy.\" It was prepared\nas follows :\u2014A mask was taken and fixed upon a thick piece of cardboard.\nMuslin was arranged round the mask, and a thick collar of cardboard coated\nwith luminous paint encircled the whole. Tho collar had been exposed to\nthe sun throughout the day, so that when I uncovered the form it was\nrendered distinctly visible by the light thrown upon it by the now luminous\ncollar. This spirit-face is interesting as indicating one method of producing\nmaterialisation phenomena without the aid of an accomplice, for a conjurer\nof Mr. Davey's skill would have had but little difficulty in manipulating it\nin my absence.\nThe second spirit was personated by myself. A turban was fixed upon\nmy head, a theatrical beard covered my chin, muslin drapery hung about my\nshoulders. The book from which I read was a portfolio coated inside with\nluminous paint. It was concealed in the cupboard, where it lay wrapped up\nin black cloth, and when this covering was removed the book gaped a little,\nand so gave rise to the thin streak of light which Mr. R. describes.\nBefore materialising, I mounted up on to the back part of Mr. Davey's\nchair, from which position I gained several advantages. At one moment I\ncould bend forwards so as to appear close to the table in front of the medium,\nand at another, by standing upright, I could bring my head close to the\nceiling. Indeed, the range of possible movement is so great, and the effects\nso startling, that many people have difficulty in believing the above explana\ntion until they have seen the process repeated in a lighted room. My face\nand shoulders were rendered visible by the light thrown upon them by the\nopen \"book\" which I was supposed to be reading, so that Mr. R. could\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 301\nnot possibly have seen me when I held it above my head. For the \"fixed\nand motionless\" condition of my eyes I cannot account, the pallor of my\nface was due to flour, \"the vacant and listless expression \" is natural to me.\nThe statement that the apparition appeared to pass clean through the\nceiling with a scraping noise occurs in all three reports. It is a curious mis\ntake, founded on a blunder which I made in the acting of my part\u2014a blunder\nso serious that at the time I thought I had\u2014in part at any rate\u2014betrayed\nthe secret of our ghostly methods. When I had, still standing on Mr.\nDavey's chair, risen to my whole height, I gradually elevated the \" open \"\nbook above my head, shut it and firmly pressed the two sides of the cover\ntogether. But the portfolio had been exposed to the sun all the day and the\ncover had in consequence become warped, so that its free margins were bent\naway from one another. When I pressed them together, they adhered for\nan instant and then burst asunder with a loud report which was mistaken by\nthe listeners for the brushing of the spirit form against the ceiling.\nThe seance did not terminate immediately after this, as Mr. R.'s account\nseems to suggest, but a very considerable interval elapsed, during which I\nslowly found my way out of the room. Mr. Davey then lit the gas in the\nilining-room, whilst I at the same time turned up the gas in the passage\noutside and then retreated upstairs\u2014there to remain till the sitters should\ndepart. I believe the statement that the medium's hands were held con\ntinuously throughout the seance except when he was turning on the musical\nbox or lighting the gas is perfectly correct.\nAnd now I think I have sufficiently explained the methods employed in\nthis materialisation seance, and the reader has probably already long ago\ncome to the conclusion that the sitters were in this case peculiarly unscien\ntific and ill-suited for the investigation of these phenomena. To have\nneglected to lock the door themselves and yet to suppose it had been carefully\nlocked, to have omitted to search in one of the cupboards and yet to imagine\nthey had searched \" every article of furniture,\" does indeed appear extraor\ndinary neglect and carelessness. And yet I do not think there are many per\nsons who would have taken these precautions, simple as they seem, or, if\nthey had done so, would not have neglected other tests equally important.\nAfter all, their omitting to lock the door themselves was not an important\n\u00abrror on the part of the sitters, since nothing would have been easier than\nfor Mr. Davey to have provided me with a duplicate key, although I will\nnot be sure whether he had two keys in this particular case.\nI may also add that the cupboard, in which the gong and other materiali\nsation apparatus were concealed, was only a small side cupboard wholly\nJtidden from view by the door of the large central compartment when the\nlatter was opened, and it needed a very careful investigation to discern that\nit did not form part of the central cupboard itself. The omissions, therefore,\nof the sitters are not so absurd as they at first appear. Let the reader also\nremember that Mr. Davey had given seances more or less similar to this one\nbefore other sitters, and yet in no case had any suspicion of his modus\noperandi entered their heads. I may further mention that in one case I had\nassisted in the production of the phenomena (which, however, did not in this\ncase include materialisation) when the sitting was not held in the medium's\nown house.\n\fMr. R. Hodgson.\n'For my own part, I think that the three published reports of this sitting\nare by no means extraordinary for their inaccuracy, and this conclusion is\nborne out by a reference to other reports of seances\u2014reports by both sceptics\nand Spiritualists. Except in those rare cases in which I was myself present\nat the sitting, it is impossible for me to say where exactly the misstatements\ncame in. But in most of the accounts which I have read there are grave\nomissions, in many there are positive statements about facts, which the\nwriter could not possibly have known, and in almost all there is a confusion\nbetween the phenomena observed and the inferences drawn from those\nphenomena. And this is true even of the accounts written by trained\nscientific men\u2014even of what I may call the classic literature of Spiritualism.\nThe errors of the reports appear even less striking when we take into\naccount the fact that the accuracy of a report naturally varies inversely with\nthe miraculous and sensational nature of the phenomena. If reports of\nslate-writing seances are full of mistakes, those of materialisation seances\nmust be much more so. Indeed, I doubt whether the most scientific and\nunemotional of men would be capable of giving an accurate account of every\ndetail they had seen after having been in the presence of the \" figure\nfrightful in its ugliness,\" or of that other form with the stony and fixed eyes\nwhich Mr. R. describes. But, even so, the results are extraordinary, unless\none recognises their true explanation, which is to bo found not in the in\nferiority of the sitters but in the superiority of the medium.\nThe methods devised by Mr. Davey were simple enough\u2014so simple that one\nis astonished at his boldness in using them. But, as I have already pointed\nout, the mere mechanical means which he used were nothing, the personality\nof the medium was everything. Had silence been maintained throughout\nthe seance, success would have been impossible. Had Mr. Davey and\nmyself changed parts it would have been equally impossible. There are\nfew men, indeed, who with such simple contrivances could have produced so\namazing an effect on the minds of the sitters. Professional mediums would\nprobably laugh at the clumsiness of his methods. But he had a power which\nthey lack\u2014a power which more than compensated for any want of conjuring\ndexterity or experience in deceiving. He had such a control over the\nsitters' minds that he could divert their attention almost whenever he\npleased ; he could persuade them they had seen what they had not seen ; he\ncould make their very tests a trap into which they should themselves fall.\nAnd Mr. Wallace is quite right in supposing that this seance cannot be\nexplained as a simple mechanical or sleight of hand trick. But the extra\nsomething which is wanting is not Spiritualism, it has no connection with\nSpiritualism. It is nothing else than the extraordinary genius of Mr.\nDavey.\nLet us now turn to an account by Spiritualists of a sitting with\nMr. W. S. Davis, to whom I have referred above (p. 295). Prior to\nhis giving sittings himself, Mr. Davis had been very aggressive in\ndenouncing bogus mediums, and, moreover, not a few persons were made\naware that he had no \" mediumistic \" power at all. Further, the Xew\nYork Herald, of June 13th, 1891, contained an article on the subject\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 303\nexplaining what Mr. Davis proposed to do, and quoting some letters\nwritten by Mr. Davis to a reporter in proof of its assertions. Mr.\nDavis wrote, inter alia :\u2014\nThe great argument with the Spiritualists is this :\u2014Are we deceived ?\nAre we not as capable of detecting trickery as you are ? We are shrewd in\nbusiness matters, why should we be less shrewd in this ? . . . Now.\nmy object in giving these stances is to get evidence that people can be\ndeceived very easily. . . . All that I do is trickery, and I am doing just\nexactly what all oftheir famous mediums have boon and are now doing.\nThis article and another warning article which appeared in The\nBanner of Light, a Spiritualistic paper, caused considerable disquiet\namong the Spiritualists who were endorsing Mr. Davis's manifestations\nas genuine. Finally, Mr. Davis \" expressed a desire to give a seance\nunder strictly test conditions and let a committee judge.\" This offer\nwas accepted. In the following account I abridge from the statement\nmade by Mr. Davis :\u2014\nThe date for the test seance was July 23rd, 1891, and only 15 persons\nwere permitted to attend. The seance was a success, and congratulations\nwere plentiful. The following report appeared in The Better Way of\nAugust l5th, 1891 :\u2014\n\"An Endorsement.\n\" To the Editor of The Better Wag.\n\" Dear Sir,\u2014We, the undersigned, tested the powers of W. S. Davis\non Thursday evening, July 23rd, 1891, by applying such conditions as, in our\njudgment, absolutely precluded the possibility of fraud. The medium sub\nmitted to severe tying. The only door leading into the seance-room was\nlocked, sealed, and carefully watched. The medium permitted us to put him\ninto a large bag so that not even his head was exposed, and the sealing, &c,\nwas done by us, and not by confederates. We practically had charge of the\nseance from beginning to end, and there were no friends of the medium\npresent not equally known to us. The room was carefully examined before\nthe seance, and during the sCance the cabinet was opened for examination at\nvery frequent intervals. Under these stringent conditions wonderful mani\nfestations of spirit-power were given without delay, and immediately after\nthe cabinet curtain was drawn in each case.\n\"It is worthy of note that writing was obtained on a slate which was\nlocked up in a box and doubly secured by the liberal application of sealing\nwax, when the medium did not touch the box or slate.\n\" James B. Bogert, Elizabeth F. Kurth, Mrs. M. T. Morris, Hermann\nHandrich, Wm. C. Coss, Elizabeth A. Smith, John M. Coombs, Eleanor\nDailey, Elizabeth S. Davis, Alexander S. Davis, Louis Sherk, W. P. Munroe,\nMrs. W. P. Munroe, Margaret Smith.\"\nThe following report also appeared in The Progressive TJnnker for August\n8th, 1891, and an account by Mr. Handrich was published in Psyehische\nStwtien for October, 1891\n\"The undersigned, a correspondent forthe Psychische Studien, of Leipsig,\nGermany, and a number of prominent Spiritualists and mediums of Brooklyn,\n\f304 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nreceived invitations from Mr. W. S. Davis to attend a seance under test\nconditions, in order to convince his friends of the genuineness of his\nmediumistic gifts. The handsome residence of Mrs. M. Towers, a lady\nhighly esteemed by her friends, and of prominent social standing, had been\nplaced at the disposition of Mr. Davis and members of the circle. . As I have\npreviously mentioned in a letter addressed to Mr. Davis (in relation to a\nformer seance' which was held in the same premises), that confederates, if\nany, could find an easy access behind the curtain which fenced off a corner\nof the large sitting-room, I was requested by the medium to seal the only\ndoor leading to the room from the vestibule of the house, to which I gladly\nconsented. Double walls, trap doors, and other hiding places are out of\nquestion ; notwithstanding, I convinced myself by ocular inspection, and\nguided by Mr. Bogert, Inspector of Buildings. Next, I assisted in tying\nthe wrists of the medium, and I know positively that it was not legerdemainly\ndone, as the blood hardly could circulate under the firm pressure of a hard\nrope which was used for this purpose. A few minutes after the medium took\nhis seat in the corner, hidden by the curtain which separated him from the\nspectators, brilliant sparks and lights appeared in front of it ; no electric\npress-the-button affair, but genuine phenomena of occult power. Bells were\nringing ; one of them, and likewise a slate, were thrown over the curtain,\nwhich extended in height only about four feet from the floor. Mr. Wicks,\nthe master of ceremonies, drew back the curtain. The medium extended his\nhands, which by close examination and bright light bore witness that they\nhad not been untied, as the rope actually cut itself into the flesh, and the\nimpressions of its texture were distinctly visible on the skin of the upper\npart of the wrists after the rope was cut through with a knife.\n\" Unbound, the medium again sat himself in the corner. The curtain\nwas drawn ; a long rope, besides the small one, was handed over the curtain\nby Mr. Wicks, and a few minutes after it was drawn back again and the\nmedium was securely tied to the chair. Remaining in this position, his coat\nwas taken off and put on again ; musical instruments wero played, accom\npanying the songs of the audience, and other manifestations witnessed, whilst\nthe rope, after repeated examinations, proved not to have been tampered\nwith in any way or manner, of which I gladly and conscientiously bear\nwitness, as I convinced myself of the fact.\n\"The next test to which the medium submitted, after having been delivered\nof his fetters by the same occult intelligence which bound him to the chair,\nwas to be put into a bag. I also assisted in this operation, and after the\nbag was shut and sealed over the medium's head, I knew that there was no\nother exit for him except by getting out where he was put in. In this\nposition the medium was placed on his chair in the corner, and with him a\nsmall wooden chest containing an unprepared clean slate. The chest was\nthoroughly examined by me and others ; the padlock, the cover, and buttons\nsealed up, and then placed in the corner where the medium was seated.\nAfter a short pause, Mr. Wicks and myself got the medium out of the bag\n:md the slate out of the chest, and found written thereon : ' We have done\nenough. H.' (H. stands for Haicidoka, the nom de phtme of the medium's\ncontrol.) The seals on the door, padlock, bag, and chest were found un\nbroken, to which I testify without fear or favour.\n\"Hermann Handrich.\"\n\fMr. Davey'8 Imitations by Conjuring, &c. 305\nI will now describe just exactly what did occur at the test seance.\nAfter the company was seated, I took a seat in the \"cabinet.\" Mr. Wicks\nasked the people to sing. While they were singing \"Nearer, my God, to Thee,\"\nMr. Wicks extinguished the light and handed to me, in the darkness, an\nelectric battery, to which was connected by a wire a small incandescent lamp.\nLights were shown by \"pressing the button,\" although Mr. Handrich states\nthat such was not the case. Various results were produced by moving the\nlamp from one place to another, by short and long pressure on the button,\nand by wrapping different coloured tissue paper around the lamp, &c.\nMr. Wicks then gave me a \" transparency \" which had been hidden\nbehind a largo picture hanging on the wall. The lamp was placed inside of\nthe thin box. The button was pressed and a life-sized hand was shown.\nThis was the end of that part of the show, and in a few minutes Mr. Wicks\nasked if a little singing would increase the forces, and was answered by two\nraps, meaning \"don't know.\" Being anxious to get more phenomena they\nsang, which enabled Mr. W. to get the lamp and \"transparency\" away from\nme without being heard.\nAfter the room was lighted, the cabinet curtain was removed and I came\nout of the pretended trance and stated to the company that conditions seemed\nto be favourable and that we would commence to test matters.\nMr. Handrich and Mr. Bogert fastened the door shut by locking it and\nsticking strips of paper from the door to the door-case with sealing wax. . . .\nThe \" first test \" consisted of being tied by occult agency, having my coat\nremoved without tampering with the ropes, and permitting the company to\nexamine the fastenings as long and as often as desired.\nAfter I got well \" under control \" Mr. Wicks hid me from view by drawing\nthe curtain. He then threw over the curtain a long and a short rope. The\nshort rope was not used, but was substituted by another rope carefully knotted,\n&c. This prepared rope is well arranged, it generally requiring considerable\ntime to make it. Braided cotton sash cord is used. The knots are made\nwhen the rope is wet and are held together by driving in soft smooth iron\nnails which are filed off close and hidden by working the rope over them.\nThis is the \" Spirit Tie Harness.\" I got it from Frank Vanderbilt, an old-\ntime medium who flourished when the Eddy family, Eva Fay, the Davenport\nBrothers, and many others were in the business. . . .\nIn my tie the principal knot is in plain view and people think it is the last\nknot tied and they know it is a slip knot. They never for a minute seem to\nthink that any other knot is of any importance. After a very careful\nexamination of the ropes it is generally settled that the trick is in my coat, if\nthe investigator happens to be of the opinion that it is a trick.\nIn talking with me about this particular manifestation, the Spiritualists\nargue in this way : \" Kellar and others do this in the theatres, but they do\nnot believe that Kellar could do it under test conditions unless he is a\nmedium\u2014and where is the proof that he is not a medium ! \"\nThe next \" test \" consisted in permitting the company to bind my wrists\ntogether with stout \u2022 twine. ' When I announced that I would submit to this\ntest, Mr. Handrich took from his pccket a thin copper wire covered with\ncloth, and asked permission to bind me with it. I said certainly, and walked\n\f30G Mr. R. Hodgson.\nover to him remarking that it was immaterial to mo who did the tying or\nbrought the string. He said it isn't string, it is wire. I said I thought that\nmetals of any kind would produce very uncomfortable sensations in my wrists,\nas wire would act as a conductor of electricity. He apologised and said that\nthe twine would serve the purpose fully as well. ... I then bared my\nleft arm and asked Mr. Bogert to tie the twine around the wrist. He did the\ntying so loose that I could have pulled my hand through. I told him to\nuntie it and make a better job of it. He declined to do so, saying that ho\nhad implicit confidence in me and would not stop the circulation of blood for\nanybody. (You see he would have been as good as a confederate, so far as\nthe tying is concerned, and it would not have been necessary for me to resort\nto the regular trick of stealing slack either.) I pretended to show a little\ntemper, and said it was a test soance, and that I wanted everything done\nthoroughly. Mr. Bogert then tied the cord around my wrist very tightly,\u2014\nthe knot being on the inside of the wrist. I presented my left arm with the\npalm of the hand up. I then went to another person and had another knot\nadded to the ones Mr. Bogert had made\u2014I went to other persons, allowing\neach to make more knots. All of this looked as though I was being well\ntied, but my real object in going from one to another to have more knots\nmade was to take a turn around my wrist with one end of the twine. This\nis sleight of hand, and is not noticed when done properly. One end of the\ntwine is wound around the wrist after the last knot on the left wrist has been\nmade, just as I am in the act of telling a person to take the other end and\npull on it ; then after taking the hitch on the first end I ask another person\nto pull on that end. Then I put my right arm exactly over my left and\nrequest the two persons to bring the two ends together and tie them tightly.\nThen I go from one to another, asking each person to add a knot. Then the\nknots are fastened with sealing wax. I then take a seat in the cabinet and\nsit there in full view until I get \" under control,\" then the curtain is drawn.\nI immediately turn my arms in opposite directions, which takes the turn out\nof the rope, and my hands are free. I can take my hands out of and get\nback into the fastenings with great quickness, which I did on this occasion.\nThe next test consisted of being tied up in a bag. The end of the bag is\ngathered together by passing a twine through brass eyelet-holes and drawing\nthe bag together by pulling the two ends of the string. When the bag is\nbeing drawn up over my head, I catch one of the loops of the twine and pull\nin as much slack as I can. This is similar to Mrs. Martin's neck-tie ex\nposed by you [At a rope-tying materialisation seance which I attended in\nNew York.\u2014R.H.], but is much better, since I do not have to close a door\nto pull in slack. Mr. Wicks is prepared to erase any marks put on the\nropes, and after the fastenings are pronounced intact he immediately cuts the\nrope in a number of places while he holds the bag up and while I am getting;\nthe extra rope in my pocket. The bag tie knot is also fastened with wax.\nThis looks good to the audience and it apparently increases the value of the\ntest, but the sealmg is really a help to the trick, as it makes it impossible to\nuntie the knot after the performance, and the string has to be cut.\nThe next \"test \" was to get writing on a slate locked up in a box while I\nwas in the bag. You should have seen them examine the slate. They\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, &'c. 307\nwashed it very carefully ; held it against a light to burn off a possible pre\npared message written in sympathetic inks. Little or no attention was paid\nto the box. The slate was put into the box. The box was then closed and\nlocked. The key-hole of the lock was covered by a piece of paper which was\nfastened with sealing wax. Several strips of paper were wound around the\npadlock and fastened with sealing wax. Then the lid and box were fastened\ntogether by sticking paper, &c.\nAfter I got \" under control \" again (in the bag) and while they were sing\ning another hymn, the lights were lowered, the cabinet curtain drawn, and\nthe box was put into the cabinet. All that I had to do was to get my head\nand arms out of the bag, and push in one end of the box and take the slate\nout. [Here Mr. Davis describes the trick-box, with diagrams.\u2014R. H.]\nThe most singular thing in connection with this \"test seance\" is the\nfact that the tests were all \" forced \" and nobody thought of it. But why\nshould they have thought of it since nearly everything called \"tests,\" so far\nas public mediums are concerned, are forced I . . . \u2022 The manifesta\ntions occurring while I was tied in the bag, &c., consisted of performing on\nthe banjo, flute, violin, bones, writing on slates, exhibiting tambourine, bells,\nand hands over the curtain, &c\nMr. Davis, at my request, repeated the above performances in detail\nbefore a group of our members, including myself, in New York, and\nafter each performance he illustrated his methods in full light to the\ncomplete satisfaction of all the persons present. Mr. Davis informs,\nme that he and Mr. Wicks \"will undertake to explain the methods of,\nand reproduce the performance of, any slate-writing, fire-test, rope-\ntying, etherealising, and materialising medium who will go before a\ncommittee of your Society and permit us to be present.\"\nReturning now to the accounts which I have given of Mr. Davey's\nmethods,\u2014in connection with the statement made by Mr. Wallace that\nunless all Mr. Davey's phenomena can be explained by \" trick,\" he will\nbe confirmed in his \" belief that Mr. Davey was really a medium as\nwell as a conjurer,\"\u2014what is the value of the testimony to such\nphenomena given by persons who are in the position of Mr. Wallace,\nunable to distinguish between the avowed medium and the avowed and\nproved conjurer 1 Many other Spiritualists have apparently held the\nsame position. Thus, Mr. Dixon, writing to The Spiritualist in 1875,\nsaid that he was \" thoroughly nonplussed \" by Dr. Lynn's cabinet\nperformance.\nUnless the spirits did \"it,\" I am utterly at a loss how to account for\nit, and my only way out of the difficulty, when questioned by my friends,\nwas to claim this part of the performance as a genuine piece of Spiritual\nism. ... I am sure the cause of Spiritualism would gain immensely\nif Lynn's seance [?] could be explained. . . . If I had not paid my\nmoney for an evening with Dr. Lynn I should have come away from it as a\n\f308 Mr. R. Hodgson.\nSpiritualist seance with the most perfect assurance that the manifestations\n-were genuine.\nMr. Gledstanes, writing in the same year, 1875, points to the prob\nability of the medium's doubles doing the feats, and strongly suggests\nthat Maskelyne and Cook project arms from their bodies ! Mr.\nColeman, writing in 1874, says :\u2014\nAll inquirers who desire to study the psychological character of\nspiritual manifestations should be recommended to visit Messrs. M. and C.\n[Maskelyne and Cook], who have gone on practising them with a persever\nance worthy of a better aim, and who are, in my opinion, the best of living\nmediums.\nSomewhat similarly, Mr. Wallace in 1877 describes a performance\nof Dr. Lynn's at the Royal Aquarium, including a cabinet trick, and\nthe moving and floating of a table about the stage, two feet from the\nfloor. He says :\u2014\nYour readers must be told that Dr. Lynn is not the performer ; but a\ngentleman who is introduced as \"a medium\u2014a real medium \" ; and I must\nsay I believe him to be one.\nA week later \" M.A. (Oxon.)\" added his testimony as follows, in a\npassage which I quoted in my previous article :\u2014\nI am glad to see that Mr. Alfred Wallace agrees, after seeing Lynn's\nmedium, with the substance of my letter in your issue of July 6th. Given\nmediumship and shamelessness enough so to prostitute it, and conjuring can,\nno doubt, be made sufficiently bewildering. It is sheer nonsense to treat\nsuch performances as Maskelyne's, Lynn's, and some that have been shown\nat the Crystal Palace, as \" common conjuring.\" Mr. Wallace positively says,\n\" If you think it is all juggling, point out exactly where the difference lies\nbetween it and mediumistic phenomena.\"\nIt is not surprising that statements of this kind should have called\nforth such an emphatic remonstrance as the following from Mr. Coates,\nwho at the same time professed his belief in Spiritualism :\u2014\nThe man who cannot distinguish between mediumship and conjuring,\nthough he be a doctor of law, science, medicine, or divinity\u2014his evidence is\nshaky, his theories not worth the paper they are written on, and his advocacy\nthe cause had better be without.\nMr. Wallace, however, does not seem to have made any advance\nsince 1877 in his discrimination between conjuring and alleged medium-\nship of the kind we are considering. Why ? Is it not obviously because\nno discrimination can be made 1 And accordingly many Spiritualists\ncontinue to call conjurers \" mediums.\" A recent instance occurs in a\ncommunication to Light for October 24th, 1891, by \" T. W.\" He\nwrites that \" we may say, without prevarication, that the conjurers\nhave utilised physical Spiritism.'*' He refers to a coin trick by Bosco,\nand apparently regards it as involving \" mediumship.\" (It was\nprobably a variation of the coin trick described in Modern Magic,\n\fMr. Davey's Imitations by Conjuring, d-c. 309\np. 161.) He also mentions the \"famous conjurer,\" M. Duprez,\nand says : \" He must be a powerful physical medium. I saw his\nperformance some years ago, and ... I believe that there is\nscarcely a ' trick ' performed in which he is not aided or supplanted\nby unseen force.\" Now, statements like these, absurd as they seem to\npersons familiar with conjuring operations, do not originate simply and\nmerely from ignorance of conjuring, and the remedy is not, simply and\nmerely, to become acquainted with certain trick-devices.i The remedy\nfor such absurdity is to learn that an uninitiated witness cannot\ndescribe to himself the real conditions under which the feats were\nperformed, because his powers of observation and memory are inade\nquate for the purpose. He may rightly conclude that under such and\nsuch conditions the feats are inexplicable by conjuring, but he wrongly\nconcludes that the conditions were as he describes them.\nThe plain result from our investigation is that the great bulk of the\ntestimony to the \" physical \" marvels of Modern Spiritualism is not\nentitled to serious consideration as affording any evidence of super\nnormal phenomena. I may conclude with a warning which I venture\nto give specially to our members in America, viz., that nearly all pro\nfessional mediums form a gang of vulgar tricksters who are more or\nless in league with one another. Associated with this combination,\nhere and there, are certain other persons who either have been, or\nintend to be, professional mediums, and who are equally untrust\nworthy. These tricksters are continually deceiving fresh groups of\nuninitiated observers of their performances, and I frequently receive\ni0( coursB a knowledge of trick-devices ia likely to make a witness hesitate in-\nmany cases before concluding that a certain \"phenomenon\" was not produced by\nordinary means. But it sometimes acts the other way, especially if the witness\nthinks that he is already an expert. The well-known conjurer Kellar was not\nfamiliar with special \"slate-writing\" methods when he was in India in 1882, and\nEglinton was able to deceive him. Kellar afterwards changed his opinion as to\nEglinton's phenomena when he became familiar with the methods. Yet even at\nthis later date, he was unable, in conversation with me, to offer any explanation\nof the production of writing between slates screwed together and sealed, kc, as\ndescribed above, though he did not suppose it was other than a trick. Similarly\nit seems to me quite likely that an expert in the different trick-methods of open\ning sealed envelopes might be baffled by the trick described as follows in Revela\ntions of a Spirit-Medium, pp. 178-9 :\u2014\n\"But the smoothest thing in the sealed letter reading, and the one that has.\npuzzled the people for years, is usually done in connection with 'slate-writing.'\nThe ' sitter ' is furnished with a heavy white envelope, of small size, and a white\ncard of the size of an ordinary visiting card. He is requested to write the name\nof a spirit friend on the card, and to write one or not more than two questions\nwith it. After he has written as requested, he is instructed to place the card in\nthe envelope with the writing next the smooth side and away from the glue. This\nbeing done, he is furnished with letter-wax with which he seals the seams to\nprevent the envelope being opened.\n\"The ' medium ' now takes his scat at the table opposite his sitter and near a\n\f310 Mr. B. Hodgson.\naccounts of them which, I need hardly say, are entirely worthless for\nthe purposes of our investigation. It is not from the professional\nmediums \u2014so numerous in the United States\u2014for \"slate-writing,\"\n\" materialisation,\" and kindred performances, that we can look for any\nenlightenment whatever, on the positive side, in the course of Psychical\nResearch.\n.window. Placing the envelope on a 6lato he thrusts it beneath the table. After\nsitting long enough to do his work, raps are heard on the slate, and, withdraw\ning it, he hands it to the ' sitter.' The envelope still lies on the slate, and there\nis no evidence of its having been touched. The seals are intact, and there is nob\na mark or mar on it.\n\"On the slate is written the replies to his questions, and the name of tho\nspirit addressed is signed at the bottom of the message.\"\nThe expert in opening letters would rightly conclude that the envelope had\nnot been opened, and if he did not allow a margin for hi* ignorance of special\ndevices, he might be disposed to attribute the phenomenon to some \"clairvoyant\"\npower.\n\"In order to perform this trick, do just as the ' medium ' did up to the time\nhe placed or held the slate beneath the table. Instead of holding it there with\nyour hand, slip one corner between your leg and the seat of the chair. Thus you\nare holding it by sitting on it. Your hand is now free to do as you choose with.\nYour ' sitter ' cannot see your movements, for the table is interposed. Put your\nfingers into the ticket pocket of your coat and bring out a small sponge that is\nsaturated with alcohol ; dampen the envelope over the card and you can easily\nread the name and question. Write the answer and sign the name addressed, and\nyour ' sitter ' will be ' paralysed ' with astonishment.\n\"Nothing will serve to dampen the envelope but alcohol. Nothing else will\nallow of your reading the writing on the enclosed card, and nothing else will dry\nout quickly enough and leave absolutely no traces of any manipulation. Water\nwill not dry out quick enough, and when it dots dry leaves the envelope shrunken\nwhere it was applied, thus leading your ' sitter ' to suspect that you have not\nplayed fair.\"\n\fRecord of a Haunted House. 311\nIII.\nRECORD OF A HAUNTED HOUSE.\nBy Miss R. C. Morton.\nPrefatory Note.\n[The first intimation which I received of the series of phenomena\ndescribed below was in a letter received in December, 1884, from Mr. J. W.\nGraham, now Principal of Dalton Hall, Manchester. Mr. Graham had heard\nan account from the gentleman mentioned below as Captain Morton ; had\nwritten this account out from memory, and had got it revised by Captain and\nMiss Morton. This account, and Miss Morton's letters to Miss Campbell,\nwhich begin with the first appearance of the figure, are the earliest written\nrecords. Captain Morton was for a time unwilling to give further accounts,\nlest the house, which belonged to a friend of his, should again become\ndepreciated in value ; as it appears from Miss Morton's record that it has\npreviously been. But on May 1st, 1886, he permitted me to call upon him ;\nand from that date onwards I visited him at intervals and took notes of what\nhe told me. I also saw Miss Morton and Miss E. Morton, and I interviewed\nat their own homes Mrs. Twining, a charwoman, and Mrs. Brown, a former\nparlourmaid. In this case it is observable that the phenomena as seen or\nheard by all the witnesses were very uniform in character\u2014even in the\nnumerous instances where there had been no previous communication\nbetween the percipients. I have found no discrepancy in the independent\ntestimonies, when collected, with the unimportant exception of General A.'s\ninability or unwillingness to recall one incident, which was already included\nin Mr. Graham's first account, soon after its occurrence, and six years before\nGeneral A., an old man, was asked to repeat it.\nCaptain Morton's reluctance to allow the evidence to be collected until\nthe haunting had ceased\u2014a reluctance based on consideration for the owner\nof the house\u2014has thus done less harm than might have been feared. It\nmust be added that Captain M. and the members of his family in general,\nwhile feeling little scientific interest in the apparition, were unusually free\nfrom superstitious fears. Miss Morton, whose account is given below, is a\nlady of scientific training, now preparing to be a physician ; and her\nnarrative has received no accretions since I first heard it. The name\nMorton is substituted for the real family name. With that exception the\nnames and initials are the true ones.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nThe house is a typical modern residence, square and commonplace\nin appearance.

On one side, but com\npletely detached, is another similar residence ; on the other side runs a\ncross road, shut out from the house by the small orchard, referred to\nin the account, and by the garden, which also extends some way at the\n\f312 Miss R. C. Morton.\nback, being altogether of a very fair size. At the end of the garden\nare stabling and a small cottage, neither of which is in present use.\nThe whole is in thoroughly good repair ; neither rats nor mice have\never been seen in the house, and there are no owls in the neighbour\nhood to account for any of the sounds heard.\nIt was built about the year 1860, on a site occupied by a market\ngarden ; while yet unfinished it was bought from the builders by the\nfirst occupant, Mr. S., an Anglo-Indian, who lived in it for about 16\nyears. During this time, in the month of August, year uncertain, he\nlost his wife, to whom he was passionately attached, and to drown his\ngrief took to drinking.\nAbout two years later, Mr. S. married again. His second wife, a\nMiss I. H., was in hopes of curing him of his intemperate habits,\nbut instead she also took to drinking, and their married life was em\nbittered by constant quarrels, frequently resulting in violent scenes.\nThe chief subjects of dispute were the management of the children\n(two girls, and either one or two boys, all quite young) of the first\nMrs. S., and the possession of her jewellery, to preserve which for\nher children, Mr. S. had some of the boards in the small front sitting-\nroom [c] taken up by a local carpenter and the jewels inserted in the\nreceptacle so formed. Finally, a few months before Mr. S.'s death, on\nthe 14th July, 1876, his wife separated from him and went to live in\nClifton. She was not present at the time of his death, nor, as far as is.\nknown, was she ever at the house afterwards.\nShe died on the 23rd September, 1878, and her remains were\nbrought back to the town to be interred in a churchyard, about a\nquarter of a mile from the house in which she had lived.\nAfter Mr. S.'s death his affairs were found to be much involved,\nand the house was sold as soon as a purchaser could be found. It was\nbought by Mr. L., an elderly gentleman, who, after thoroughly\ndoing up the house, which was in a very dirty state, went there to live,\nwith his wife, a lady of about his own age ; two sons were there from\ntime to time, but never for long together.\nOld Mr. L. died rather suddenly within 6 months of going into the\nhouse, and, rather a curious coincidence, in the same small sitting-room\n(marked c) in which Mr. S. had also died, and where the jewels had\nbeen hidden, but in which the figure has never been seen.\nMrs. L. the widow (still alive) moved into a smaller house, very\nsoon after her husband's death, and [ ] remained empty for some\nyears\u2014probably four.\nDuring this time there is no direct evidence of haunting, but\nwhen inquiry was made later on much hearsay evidence was brought\nforward : for example, an old job gardener, who often worked at the\nhouse opposite, is said to have frequently seen the figure of a tall lady\n\fRecord, oj a ffayinted ffome, 313\nin black in the garden of [ ]. This old man was on inquiry\nfound to be dead and his widow could not be traced.\nA lady (Mrs. P.), who had at one time resided in the same town,\nand after an absence of some years returned there to live, was met\nby me at a friend's house, and expressed great interest in the\napparition, which she said seemed to be identical with one seen in the\n.same house shortly after the death of Mrs. S. After the lapse of time\nit was, however, found impossible to trace this story to its source,\nI was also told by a friend that during the summer of 1879 or\n1880, the house was offered to a lady at a rental of \u00a360, which is less\nthan half of what is now asked and given. In April, 1882, the house\nwas let by the representatives of the late Mr. L. to Captain Morton,'\nand it is during his tenancy (not yet terminated) that the appearances\nrecorded have taken place.\nThe family consists of Captain M. himself ; his wife, who is a great\ninvalid, neither of whom saw anything ; a married daughter, Mrs^\nK., then about 26, who was only a visitor from time to time,\nsometimes with, but more often without, her husband ; 4 unmarried\ndaughters, myself, then aged 19, who was the chief percipient and\nnow give the chief account of the apparition ; E. Morton, then\naged 18 ; L. and M. Morton, then 15 and 13 ; 2 sons, one of 16, who\nwas absent during the greater part of the time when the apparition\nwas seen; the other, then 6 years old.\nMy father took the house in March, 1882, none of us having\nthen heard of anything unusual about the house. We moved in\ntowards the end of April, and it was not until the following June that\nI first saw the apparition.\nI had gone up to my room, but was not yet in bed, when I heard\nsomeone at the door, and went to it, thinking it might be my mother.\nOn opening the door, I saw no one ;- but on going a few steps along the\npassage, I saw the figure of a tall lady, dressed in black, standing at\nthe head of the stairs. After a few moments she descended the stairs,\nand I followed for a short distance, feeling curious what it could be.\nI had only a small piece of candle, and it suddenly burnt itself out ;\nand being unable to see more, I went back to my room.\nThe figure was that of a tall lady, dressed in black of a soft woollen\nmaterial, judging from the slight sound in moving. The face was\nhidden in a handkerchief held in the right hand. This is all I noticed\nthen ; but on further occasions, when I was able to observe her more\nclosely, I saw the upper part of the left side of the forehead, and\na little of the hair above. Her left hand was nearly hidden by her\nsleeve and a fold of her dress. As she held it down a portion of a\nwidow's cuff was visible on both wrists, so that the whole impression\nwas that of a lady in widow's weeds. There was no cap on the head\nY\n\f314 Miss R. C. Morton.\nbut a general effect of blackness suggests a bonnet, with long veil or a.\nhood.\nDuring the next two years\u2014from 1882 to 1884\u2014I saw the figure\nabout half a dozen times ; at first at long intervals, and afterwards at\nshorter, but I only mentioned these appearances to one friend, who did.\nnot speak of them to anyone.\nDuring this period, as far as we know, there were only 3 appear\nances to anyone else.\n1. In the summer of 1882 to my sister, Mrs. K., when the figure\nwas thought to be that of a Sister of Mercy who had called at the\nhouse, and no further curiosity was aroused. She was coming down\nthe stairs rather late for dinner at 6.30, it being then quite light, when,\nshe saw the figure cross the hall in front of her, and pass into the\ndrawing-room. She then asked the rest of us, already seated at\ndinner, \" Who was that Sister of Mercy whom I have just seen going\ninto the drawing-room 1 \" She was told there was no such person, and\na servant was sent to look ; but the drawing-room was empty, and she\nwas sure no one had come in. Mrs. K. persisted that she had seen a,\ntall figure in black, with some white about it ; but nothing further was\nthought of the matter.\n2. In the autumn of 1883 it was seen by the housemaid about 10\np.m., she declaring that someone had got into the house, her description\nagreeing fairly with what I had seen ; but as on searching no one was\nfound, her story received no credit.\n3. On or about December 18th, 1883, it was seen in the drawing-\nroom by my brother and another little lxiy. They were playing\noutside on the terrace, when they saw the figure in the drawing-room\nclose to the window, and ran in to see who it could be that was crying\nso bitterly. They found no one in the drawing-room, and the parlour\nmaid told them that no one had come into the house.\nAfter the first time, I followed the figure several times downstairs,\ninto the drawing-room, where she remained a variable time, generally\nstanding to the right hand side of the bow window. From the draw\ning-room she went along the passage towards the garden door, where\nshe always disappeared.\nThe first time I spoke to her was on the 29th January, 1884. \"I\nopened the drawing-room door softly and went in, standing just by it.\nShe came in past me and walked to the sofa and stood still there, so I\nwent up to her and asked her if I could help her. She moved, and I\nthought she was going to speak, but she only gave a slight gasp and\nmoved towards the door. Just by the door I spoke to her again, but\nshe seemed as if she were quite unable to speak. She walked into the.\nhall, then by the side door she seemed to disappear as before.\" (Quoted\nfrom a letter written on January 31st.) In May and June, 1884, I\n\fRecord of a Haunted House. 315\ntried some experiments, fastening strings with marine glue across the\nstairs at different heights from the ground\u2014of which I give a more\ndetailed account later on.\nI also attempted to touch her, but she always eluded me. It was\nnot that there was nothing there to touch, but that she always seemed\nto be beyond me, and if followed into a corner, simply disappeared.\nDuring these two years the only noises I heard were those of slight\npushes against my bedroom door, accompanied by footsteps ; and if I\nlooked out on hearing these sounds, I invariably saw the figure. \"Her\nfootstep is very light, you can hardly hear it, except on the linoleum,\nand then only like a person walking softly with thin boots on.\"\n(Letter on January 31st, 1884.) The appearances during the next\ntwo months\u2014July and August, 1884\u2014became much more frequent;\nindeed they were then at their maximum, from which time they seem\ngradually to have decreased, until now they seem to have ceased.\nOf these two months I have a short record in a set of journal\nletters written at the time to a friend. On July 21st I find the\nfollowing account. \" I went into the drawing-room, where my father\nand sisters were sitting, about 9 in the evening, and sat down on a\ncouch close to the bow window. A few minutes after, as I sat reading,\nI saw the figure come in at the open door, cross the room and take up\na position close behind the couch where I was. I was astonished that\nno one else in the room saw her, as she was so very distinct to me.\nMy youngest brother, who had before seen her, was not in the room.\nShe stood behind the couch for about half an hour, and then as usual\nwalked to the door. I went after her, on the excuse of getting a book,\nand saw her pass along the hall, until she came to the garden door,,\nwhere she disappeared. I spoke to her as she passed the foot of the\nstairs, but she did not answer, although as before she stopped and\nseemed as though about to speak.\" On July 31st, some time after I had\ngone up to bed, my second sister E., who had remained downstairs\ntalking in another sister's room, came to me saying that someone had\npassed her on the stairs. I tried then to persuade her that it was one\nof the servants, but next morning found it could not have been so, as\nnone of them had been out of their rooms at that hour, and E.'s more\ndetailed description tallied with what I had already seen.\nOn the night of August 1st, I again saw the figure. I heard the\nfootsteps outside on the landing about 2 a.m. I got up at once, and\nwent outside. She was then at the end of the landing at the top of\nthe stairs, with her side view towards me. She stood there some\nminutes, then went downstairs, stopping again when she reached the\nhall below. I opened the drawing-room door and she went in, walked\nacross the room to the couch in the bow window, stayed there a\nlittle, then came out of the room, went along the passage, and dis\ny2\n\f316 Miss R, C. Morton,\nappeared by the garden door. I spoke to her again, but she did not\nanswer.\nOn the night of August 2nd the footsteps were heard by my three\nsisters and by the cook, all of whom slept on the top landing\u2014-also by\nmy married sister, Mrs. K., who was sleeping on the floor below. They\nall said the next morning that they had heard them very plainly pass\nand repass their doors. The cook was a middle-aged and very sensible\nperson ; on my asking her the following morning if any of the servants\nhad been out of their rooms the night before, after coming up to bed,\nshe told me that she had heard these footsteps before, and that she had\nseen the figure on the stairs one night when going down to the kitchen\nto fetch hot water after the servants had come up to bed. She described\nit as a lady in widow's dress, tall and slight, with her face hidden in a\nhandkerchief held in her right hand. Unfortunately we have since\nlost sight of this servant ; she left us about a year afterwards on her\nmother's death, and we cannot now trace her. She also saw the figure\noutside the kitchen windows on the terrace-walk, she herself being in\nthe kitchen ; it was then about 1 1 in the morning, but having no note\nof the occurrence, I cannot now remember whether this appearance was\nsubsequent to the one above mentioned.\nThese footsteps are very characteristic, and are not at all like those\nof any of the people in the house ; they are soft and rather slow, though\ndecided and even. My sisters would not go out on the landing after\nhearing them pass, nor would the servants, but each time when I have\ngone out after hearing them, I have seen the figure there.\nOn August 5th I told my father about her and what we had seen\nand heard. He was much astonished, not having seen or heard anything\nhimself at that time\u2014neither then had my mother, but she is slightly\ndeaf, and is an invalid.\nHe made inquiries of the landlord (who then lived close by) as to\nwhether he knew of anything unusual about the house, as he had\nhimself lived in it for a short time, but he replied that he had only\nbeen there for three months, and had never seen anything unusual.\nOn August 6th, a neighbour, General A., who lived opposite, sent\nhis son to inquire after my married sister, as he had seen a lady crying\nin our orchard, which is visible from the road. He had described her\nto his son, and afterwards to us, as a tall lady in black, and a bonnet\nwith a long veil, crying, with a handkerchief held up to her face. He\ndid not know my sister by sight, as she had only been with us a few\ndays, and had been out very little, but he knew that she was in\nmourning for her baby son. My sister was not in the orchard that day\nat all, is rather short, and wore no veil.\nThis was the second time the figure had been mistaken for that of\na real person, the.outlines being very distinct, and the whole appearance\n\fRecord of a Haunted Souse. 317\nsolid. It is Only fair to say that the gentleman, who is a friend Of th\u00ab\nlandlord's, now tells us that he has no recollection of this incident.\nThe same evening this General A. came over to our house, and we\nall took up various stations on the watch for the figure, which, however,\nwas not seen by anyone.\nThat night my brother-in-law and sister distinctly heard footsteps\ngoing first up the stairs and then down. This was about 2 a.m.\nOn the evening of August 11th we were sitting in the drawing-\nroom, with the gas lit but the shutters not shut, the light outside\ngetting dusk, my brothers and a friend having just given up tennis,\nfinding it too dark; my eldest sister, Mrs. K., and myself both saw the\nfigure on the balcony outside, looking in at the window. She stood\nthere some minutes, then walked to the end and back again, after\nwhich she seemed to disappear. She soon after came into the drawing-\nroom, when I saw her, but my sister did not.\nThe same evening my sister E. saw her on the stairs as she came\nout of a room on the upper landing.\nThe following evening, August 12th, while coming up the garden, I\nwalked towards the orchard, when I saw the figure cross the orchard,\ngo along the carriage drive in front of the house, and in at the open\nside door, across the hall and into the drawing-room, I following. She\ncrossed the drawing-room, and took up her usual position behind the\ncouch in the bow window. My father came in soon after, and I told\nhim she was there. He could not see the figure, but went up to where\nI showed him she was. She then went swiftly round behind him,\nacross the room, out of the door, and along the hall, disappearing as\nusual near the garden door, we both following her. We looked out\ninto the garden, having first to unlock the garden door, which my\nfather had locked as he came through, but saw nothing of her.\nOn August 12th, about 8 p.m., and still quite light, my sister E.\nwas singing in the back drawing-room. I heard her stop abruptly,\ncome out into the hall, and call me. She said she had seen the figure\nin the drawing-room, close behind her as she sat at the piano. I went\nback into the room with her, and saw the figure in the bow window in\nher usual place. I spoke to her several times, but had no answer.\nShe stood there for about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour ; then,\nwent across the room to the door, and along the passage, disappearing\nin the same place by the garden door. ,\nMy sister M. then came in from the garden, saying she had seen her\ncoming up the kitchen steps outside. We all three then went out into\nthe garden, when Mrs. K. called out from a window on the first\nstorey that she had just seen her pass across the lawn in front, and\nalong the carriage drive towards the orchard. This evening, then,\n\f318 Miss R. C. Morion.\naltogether 4 people saw her. My father was then away, and my\nyoungest brother was out.\nOn the morning of August 14th the parlourmaid saw her in the\ndining-room, about 8.30 a.m., having gone into the room to open the\nshutters. The room is very sunny, and even with all the shutters\nclosed it is quite light, the shutters not fitting well, and letting\nsunlight through the cracks. She had opened one shutter, when, on\nturning round, she saw the figure cross the room. We were all on the\nlook-out for her that evening, but saw nothing ; in fact, whenever we\nhad made arrangements to watch, and were especially expecting her,\nwe never saw anything. This servant, who afterwards married, was\ninterviewed by Mr. Myers at her own house.\nOn August 16th I saw the figure on the drawing-room balcony,\nabout 8.30 p.m. She did not afterwards come into the room, as on the\nformer occasion. On looking out at the side door, nothing could be\nseen.\nThe gardener said that he had seen the figure on the balcony that\nmorning early, about 6 o'clock.\nOn August 1 9th, 3 days after, we all went to the seaside, and were\naway a month, leaving three servants in the house.\nWhen we came back they said that they had heard footsteps and\nnoises frequently, but as the stair-carpets were up part of the time and\nthe house was empty, many of these noises were doubtless due to\nnatural causes, though by them attributed to the figure.\nThe cook also spoke of seeing the figure in the garden, standing by\na stone vase on the lawn behind the house.\nDuring the rest of that year and the following, 1885, the apparition\nwas frequently seen through each year, especially during July, August,\nand September. In these months the three deaths took place, viz. :\u2014\nMr. S., on July 14th, 1876, the first Mrs. S. in August, and the second\nMrs. S. on September 23rd.\nThe apparitions were of exactly the same type, seen in the same\nplaces and by the same people, at varying intervals.\nThe footsteps continued, and were heard by several visitors and\nnew servants, who had taken the places of those who had left, as well\nas by myself, 4 sisters and brother ; in all by about 20 people, many\nof them not having previously heard of the apparition or sounds.\nOther sounds were also heard in addition which seemed gradually\nto increase in intensity. They consisted of walking up and down on\nthe second-floor landing, of bumps against the doors of the bedrooms,\nand of the handles of the doors turning. The bumps against the\nbedroom doors were so marked as to terrify a new servant, who had\nheard nothing of the haunting, into the belief that burglars were\nbreaking into her room, while another servant, who had a slight attack\n\fRecord of a Haunted House.\nof facial hemiplegia, attributed it to terror caused by attempts at her \u2022\ndoor wow than usual one night ; the doctor, however, thought the\nattack was caused by cold rather than fright.\nA second set of footsteps was also heard, heavy and irregular,\nconstantly recurring, lasting a great part of the night, often 3 or 4\ntimes a week. On the first floor, the same noises are heard, especially\nin the front right-hand room, formerly used by Mr. and Mrs. S.\nLouder sounds were also heard in the summer of 1885, heavy thuds\nand bumpings, especially on the upper landing.\nThese facts were kept quiet, on account of the landlord, who feared\nthey might depreciate the value of the house, and any new servants\nwere not told of them, though to anyone who Iwd already heard\nof them we carefully explained the harmless nature of the apparition.\nSome left us on account of the noises, and we never could induce any\nof them to go out of their rooms after they had once gone up for the\nnight.\nDuring this year, at Mr. Myers's suggestion, I kept a photographic\ncamera constantly ready to try to photograph the figure, but on the few\noccasions I was able to do so, I got no result ; at night, usually only by\n\u00abandle-light, a long exposure would be necessary for so dark a figure,\nand this I could not obtain. I also tried to communicate with the\nfigure, constantly speaking to it and asking it to make signs, if not able\nto speak, but with no result. I also tried especially to touch her, but\ndid not succeed. On cornering her, as I did once or twice, she\ndisappeared.\nSome time in the summer of this year (1886), Mrs. Twining, our\nregular charwoman, saw the figure, while waiting in the hall at the\ndoor leading to the kitchen stairs, for her payment. Until it suddenly\nvanished from her sight, as no real figure could have done, she thought\nit was a lady visitor who had mistaken her way. Mr. Myers inter\nviewed her on December 29th, 1889, and has her separate account.\nOn one night in July, 1886 (my father and I being away from\nbome), my mother and her maid heard a loud noise in an unoccupied\nroom over their heads. They went up, but seeing nothing and the\nnoise ceasing, they went back to my mother's room on the first storey.\nThey then heard loud noises from the morning-room on the ground\nfloor. They then went half way downstairs, when they saw a bright\nlight in the hall beneath. Being alarmed, they went up to my sister\nE., who then came down, and they all three examined the doors,\n\u2022windows, &c, and found them all fastened as usual. My mother and\nher maid then went to bed. My sister E. went up to her room on\nthe second storey, but as she passed the room where my two\nsisters L. and M. were sleeping, they opened their door to say that\nthey had heard noises, and also seen what they described as the fiams\n\f320 Miss R. C. Morton.\nof a candle, without Candle or hand visible, cross the room diagonally\nfrom corner to door. Two of the maids opened the doors of their two\nbedrooms, and said that they had also heard noises ; they all 5 stood at\ntheir doors with their lighted candles for some little time. They all\nheard steps walking up and down the landing between them ; as they\npassed they felt a sensation which they described as \" a cold wind,\"\nthough their candles were not blown about. They saw nothing. The\nsteps then descended the stairs, re-ascended, again descended, and did\nnot return.\nIn the course of the following autumn we heard traditions of earlier\nhaunting, though, unfortunately, in no case were we able to get a first\nhand account.\n1. A job gardener, who had worked several times a week at a\nhouse on the opposite side of the road, was reported to have several\ntimes seen a figure in our garden before we occupied the house. This,\nfigure he knew not to be that of a real person. On tracing him, we\nfound he had died, and his widow had left the town, and her where\nabouts was not known.\n2. I met a lady at a friend's house, who told me that, when living\nin the town 7 or 8 years before, she had frequently been told that\nthe house and garden were haunted by Mrs. S. After the lapse of\ntime she could not remember the names of any people who were\nreported to have seen anything, and we could not trace anyone.\n3. The apparition was mentioned by my uncle (since dead) at a,\nmess-table in Halifax, Nova Scotia, when an officer then present said\nthat while in the town 7 or 8 years before, he had been told that\nthe house was haunted, and remembered looking up at the windows with\ninterest as he rode past to see if he could see anything at them.\nWe also now heard from a carpenter who had done jobs in the\nhouse in Mrs. S.'s time, that Mrs. S. had wished to possess herself of\nthe first Mrs. S.'s jewels. Her husband had called him in to make a\nreceptacle under the boards in the morning-room on the ground floor,\nin which receptacle he placed the jewels, and then had it nailed down\nand the carpet replaced. The carpenter showed us the place. My\nfather made him take up the boards ; the receptacle was there, but\nempty.\nMy father thought that there might be something hidden near the\ngarden door, where the figure usually disappeared. The boards were\ntaken up, and nothing was there but the original shavings and dust.\nMy father went to Bristol, and there found the register of Mrs.\nS.'s death, which had taken place on September 23rd, 1878, from,\ndipsomania and intervening sub-gastritis. He called on the doctor\nwho had attended her, and asked him if there had been any disfigure\nment of the face which would account for its persistent concealment.\n\fRecord 6f a Haunted Souse,\nHe remembered the case, and said that there had not been, though the\nface had become more full and round.\nDuring 1887 we have few records ; the appearances were less,\nfrequent.\nOn Friday, February 4th, my sister E. was coming downstairs at\nabout 7.30 p.m., when she saw the figure moving across the hall from\nthe front door to the drawing-room, she herself being at the top of the\nfirst flight of stairs. The gas was lighted in the hall at the time.\nIn an interview with Mr. Myers on February 14th, she told him that\nshe thought this was about the 10th time she had seen the figure. She\nwent on into the dining-room and told my father ; they called me from\nthe morning-room, and we all three went into the drawing-room, of\nwhich the door was shut. Nothing was to be seen or heard.\nDuring the next two years, 1887 to 1889, the figure was very\nseldom seen, though footsteps were heard ; the louder noises had\ngradually ceased.\nFrom 1889 to the present, 1892, so far as I know, the figure has\nnot been seen at all ; the lighter footsteps lasted a little longer, but\neven they have now ceased.\nThe figure became much less substantial on its later appearances.\nUp to about 1886 it was so solid and life-like that it was often mistaken\nfor a real person. It gradually became less distinct. At all times it\nintercepted the light ; we have not been able to ascertain if it cast a\nshadow. I should mention that it has been seen through window-glass,\nand that I myself, wear glasses habitually, though none of the other\npercipients do so. The upper part of the figure always left a more\ndistinct impression than the lower, but this may partly be due to the\nfact that one naturally looks at people's faces before their feett\nProofs of Immateriality.\n1. I have several times fastened fine- strings across the stairs at\nvarious heights before going to bed, but after all others have gone up\nto their rooms. These were fastened in the following way : I made\nsmall pellets of marine glue, into which I inserted the ends of the cord,\nthen stuck one pellet lightly against the wall and the other to the\nbanister, the string being thus stretched across the stairs. They were\nknocked down by a very slight touch, and yet would not be felt by\nanyone passing up or down the stairs, and by candle-light could not\nbe seen from below. They were put at various heights from the ground,\nfrom 6 inches to the height of the banisters, about 3 feet.\nI have twice at least seen the figure pass through the cords, leaving\nthem intact.\n2. The sudden and complete disappearance of the figure, while still\nin full view.\n\f322 Miss R. C. Morton.\n3. The impossibility of touching the figure. I have repeatedly\nfollowed it into a corner, when it disappeared, and have tried to\nsuddenly pounce upon it, but have never succeeded in touching it or\ngetting my hand up to it, the figure eluding my touch.\n4. It has appeared in a room with the doors shut.\nOn the other hand, the figure was not called up by a desire to see it,\nfor on every occasion when we had made special arrangements to watch\nfor it, we never saw it. On several occasions we have sat up at night\nhoping to see it, but in vain,\u2014my father, with my brother-in-law,\nmyself with a friend 3 or 4 times, an aunt and myself twice, and my\nsisters with friends more than once ; but on none of these occasions\nwas anything seen. Nor have the appearances been seen after we have\nbeen talking or thinking much of the figure.\nThe figure has been connected with the second Mrs. S. ; the grounds\nfor which are :\u2014\n1. The complete history of the house is known, and if we are to\nconnect the figure with any of the previous occupants, she is the only\nperson who in any way resembled the figure.\n2. The widow's garb excludes the first Mrs. S.\n3. Although none of us had ever seen the second Mrs. S., several\npeople who had known her identified her from our description. On\nbeing shown a photo-album containing a number of portraits, I picked\nout one of her sister as being most like that of the figure, and was\nafterwards told that the sisters were much alike.\n4. Her step-daughter and others told us that she especially used the\nfront drawing-room in which she continually appeared, and that her\nhabitual seat was on a couch placed in a similar position to ours.\n5. The figure is undoubtedly connected with the house, none\nof the percipients having seen it anywhere else, nor had any other\nhallucination.\nConduct of Animals in the House.\nWe have strong grounds for believing that the apparition was seen\nby two dogs.\n1. A retriever who slept in the kitchen was on several occasions\nfound by the cook in a state of terror, when she went into the kitchen\nin the morning\u2014being a large dog, he was not allowed upstairs ;\nhe was also seen more than once coming from the orchard thoroughly\ncowed and terrified He was kindly treated and not at all a nervous\ndog.\n2. A small skye-terrier, whom we had later, was allowed about the\nhouse ; he usually slept on my bed, and undoubtedly heard the foot\nsteps outside the door. I have notes of one occasion, on October 27th,\n1887. The dog was then suffering from an attack of rheumatism, and\n\fRecord of a Haunted House. 323\nvery disinclined to move, but on hearing the footsteps it sprang up\nand sniffed at the door.\nTwice I remember seeing this dog suddenly run up to the mat at\nthe foot of the stairs in the hall, wagging its tail, and moving its back\nin the way dogs do when expecting to be caressed. It jumped up,\nfawning as it would do if a person had been standing there, but\nsuddenly slunk away with its tail between its legs, and retreated,\ntrembling, under a sofa. We were all strongly under the impression\nthat it had seen the figure. Its action was peculiar, and was much\nmore striking to an onlooker than it could possibly appear from a\ndescription.\nWe have no horses, and the cat, as a rule, lives only in the kitchen;\nwe have never noticed anything peculiar about her behaviour.\nIn conclusion, as to the feelings aroused by the presence of the\nfigure, it is very difficult to describe them ; on the first few occasions,\nI think the feeling of awe at something unknown, mixed with a strong\ndesire to know more about it, predominated. Later, when I was able\nto analyse my feelings more closely, and the first novelty had gone off,\nI felt conscious of a feeling of loss, as if I had lost power to the figure.\nMost of the other percipients speak of feeling a cold wind, but I\nmyself have not experienced this.\nIn writing the above account, my memory of the occurrences has\nbeen largely assisted by reference to a set of journal letters written at\nthe time, and by notes of interviews held by Mr. Myers with my father\nand various members of our family.\nR. C. Morton.\nApril 1st, 1892.\nSee also separate accounts of :\u2014\nI. Miss Campbell.\nII. Miss E. Morton.\nIII. My brother, W. H. C. Morton.\nIV. Mrs. K.\nV. Mrs. Brown.\nVI. Mrs. Twining.\nL\nI beg to certify that the letters from which Miss Morton has\nlargely quoted were written to me by her on the dates mentioned, and\nare still in my possession, but being of the nature of a diary, contain\nso many allusions to private matters that neither Miss Morton nor I\nat present see our way to making them over to the Society for Psychical\nResearch.\nMiss Morton wishes me to state that, although I have never seen\nthe figure, I have heard the footsteps, and that they certainly are\n\f324 . Miss 22. 0. Mortem,\nunlike those of any member of the M. family, and could not possibly\nbe attributed to them. The servants are excluded by the fact that\nthey were all changed during the time that the footsteps continued,\nand were unaltered in character,\nI may add as . a curious circumstance that on the night on which\nMiss Morton first spoke to the figure, as stated in her account, I myself\nsaw her telepathically. I was in my room (I was then residing in the\nNorth of England, quite 100 miles away from Miss Morton's home),\npreparing for bed, between 12 and half-past, when I seemed suddenly\nto be standing close by the door of the housemaid's cupboard (see plan\nof second floor) at ,so facing the short flight of stairs leading to\nthe top landing. Coming down these stairs, I saw the figure, exactly\nas described, and about two steps behind Miss Morton herself, with a\ndressing-gown thrown loosely round her, and carrying a candle in her\nhand. A loud noise in the room overhead recalled me to my surround\nings, and although I tried for some time I could not resume the\nimpression.\nThe black dress, dark head-gear, widow's cuffs and handkerchief\nwere plainly visible, though the details of them were not given me by\nMiss Morton till afterwards, when I asked her whether she had not\nseen the apparition on that night.\n(Signed) Catherine M. Campbell.\n77, Chesterton-road, North Kensington, W.\nMarch 31\u00ab<, 1892.\nTo this account Miss Morton adds :\u2014\" Miss Campbell was the\nfriend to whom I first spoke of the apparition. She suggested to me\nthat when next I saw her I should speak ; but of course she had no\nidea when this would be. She wrote an account to me the next day\nof what she had seen, and asked me if I had not seen the figure that\nnight ; but naturally did not know that I had done so, until she\nreceived my reply. Miss Campbell asks me to say that this is the only\nvision she has had, veridical or otherwise.\"\nII.\n(1) The first time I saw anything unusual in the house was in July,\n1884. Crossing the upper landing, after having come to bed at about\n11.15 p.m., I had an impression of something unusual, which caused\nme to start back, and then some little way in front of me I saw a\nfigure as of a widow in black preceding me down the stairs. I watched\nit down one flight, and it then disappeared ; of course, in this position\nit had its back to me.\n(2) The next time I saw the figure was one evening at about\n8 o'clock, in July, 1885, a fine evening and quite light. I was sitting\n\fRecord of a Haunted Souse, 325\nalone in the drawing-room singing, when suddenly I felt a cold, icy\nshiver, and I saw the figure bend over me, as if to turn over the pages\nof my song. I called my sister, who was in another room. She came\nat once, and said she could see it still in the room, though I then\ncould not.\n(3) After coming up to bed, one night in July, 1886, my mother,\nmyself, and one of the maids heard noises downstairs in the hall, On\ngoing down to investigate the cause, we saw nothing, and the noises\nceased. After again returning to the top landing, the noises \"\nbegan again. It sounded as if people were throwing heavy articles,\nsuch as boots, across the passage and down the stairs. Door handles\nseemed to rattle too, the night being still and no one about. Two\nmaids and my two sisters and myself listened on the top landing, with\nlighted candles in our hands, when we distinctly heard the footsteps\npass and repass us quite close, but saw nothing, most of us feeling\nwhat we term the \" icy shiver.\"\n(4) I had just gone upstairs, on February 4th, 1887, to fetch some\nprescriptions for my father, when I saw the same figure preceding me\ndown the stairs. It went into the drawing-room, which was then not\nbeing used. My father and I lighted a candle, and stayed in the room\nfor some little time, but saw nothing.\nThe figure appears to me as that of a tall woman in old-fashioned\nwidow's weeds, with the left hand partly hidden under the folds of her\ndress, and the right hand with a handkerchief placed to her face,\nalmost obscuring the whole of the face, with the exception of the upper\npart of the forehead and hair. The hands are long and very well\nshaped. Edith Morton.\nIII.\n(1) On or about December 18th, 1883, I was playing with a school-\nfriend on the path in front of the drawing-room windows, when on\nlooking up at the drawing-room we both saw a tall figure in black,\nholding a handkerchief to her face with her right hand, seated at the\nwriting-table in the window, and therefore in full light. We came in at\nonce, but on going into the room found no one there, and on making\ninquiries found that no stranger had been in the house that afternoon.\nAs far as I can remember, this was about 3.15 in the afternoon, At\nall events, it was full daylight at the time.\nSince then I have seen the figure twice.\n(2) Once when coming out of the drawing-room, about half-past\neight (just after the gas had been lit throughout the house), I saw the\nfigure going down the passage towards the side door, thus having her\nback to me. It finally disappeared in the direction of the kitchen\nstairs.\n\f32G Miss R. C. Morton.\n(3) The other time, on coming out of a room at the end of a passage\non the first landing, I saw it going along the passage towards the stair\ncase, but it turned back and finally disappeared through the door of\nanother bedroom. This was about 6 o'clock in the evening, the gas\nnot yet being lit, and so the light was somewhat dim.\n(4) Another time I was in the morning-room, and had a momen\ntary glimpse of the figure, but not long enough to be absolutely certain\nof having seen it. This was in the evening, the gas having been lit\nboth in the room and in the passage outside.\nBesides these appearances I have occasionally heard noises like a\nperson walking about with soft slippers, but on looking out I have seen\nnothing, and sometimes the noises have stopped, but at other times\nhave gone on without interruption.\nPreviously to seeing the appearances (1) and (2) I had heard\nnothing about anything unusual being seen in the house.\nW. H. C. Morton.\nDecember 31st, 1891.\nIV.\nWhilst staying at , in the autumn of 1883, I was coming down\nthe stairs, about five in the afternoon, when I saw a tall figure in\nblack cross the hall, push open the drawing-room door, and go in.\nAt the time I thought she was a Sister of Mercy, from her long veil,\nthe figure being entirely substantial, and like that of a real person,\nalthough on others making inquiries, no one had called.\nThis, I may mention, was the year before I heard of any appear\nance being known of in the house. At another time I thought I saw\nher in the summer of 1884 looking in at the drawing-room window\nfrom outside. This time the figure was not so distinct, the gas being\nlit in the room, while it was semi-dark outside. Soon after my sister,\nwho had also seen her, saw her enter the room ; but she was not then\nvisible to me.\nI saw the figure once more in the spare room at night, having been\nawakened, as I constantly was, by footsteps in the room. I often\nheard footsteps at night up and downstairs, like a person wearing flat\nlist or cloth slippers, and I have heard the swish of woollen drapery,\nand on several occasions the sound of heavy bodies on the landings and\nagainst the doors, and overhead the handles of doors turned, the'\nsound of something heavy being dragged overhead, on the top storey.\nMy husband and nurse have heard the same.\nI myself was much terrified at the sounds.\nF. M. K.\nMarch 29th, 1892.\n\fRecord of a Haunted Home. 327\nV.\n[I called, February 15th, 1890, on Mrs. Brown, 10, Mitre-street, St.\nLuke's, C, and heard from her the following account, which I wrote\ndown the same evening and took to her to-day, February 16th, when\nshe read, corrected, and signed it.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nAbout 7 years ago I went as parlourmaid to . At that time\nnothing had been said about the ghost, although I believe that Miss\nRase (the eldest Miss M.) had seen it for about a year.\nI think that the first person besides Miss Rose who saw it was\nMaster Willy. He was then about 8 or 9 years old, and was playing\nin the garden with another young gentleman, when they both looked\nin through the drawing-room window, and saw a widow in the room.\nThey ran up to their mother's room ;\u2014she was an invalid and seldom\nleft her bed,\u2014and told her what they had seen, but Miss Rose, who\nwas there, laughed it off.\nThe next time that it was seen was by Mrs. K., the married\nsister, who used to come and stay a month or so in the house every\nyear. She had been there three days when she said that she had seen\na widow in the drawing-room. Then Master Willy called out that that\nmust have been the same woman whom he had seen ; and after that\nMiss Rose told that she had been in the habit of seeing the figure.\nSo all those in the house knew ; but when a new servant came we\nused to take care not to tell her, because it was hard to get a girl\nto stay.\nSome months after the thing became known I was alone in the\nhouse one evening with Lizzie, a new cook, (I do not know her address\nnow), and we were standing at the door of the servants' hall, on the\nbasement floor. The passage was lit with gas. Lizzie had heard\nnothing of the ghost, I am sure. Suddenly we both saw a dark\nshadowy figure, dressed in black, and making no noise, glide past us\nalong the passage and disappear round a corner. Neither of us spoke\nas it passed ; but directly after we looked at each other, and each saw\nthat the other had seen it, and we mentioned it to each other. We\nhad seen just the same thing. I have myself never seen any white\nabout the figure ; but I know that others have seen her hold a\nhandkerchief up to her face. The figure has never looked to me quite\nsolid ; but it has always vanished too quickly for me to look closely\nat it.\nThe next time that I saw it was in the drawing-room, when I went\nin to light the gas at dusk on a summer's evening. I saw a dark figure\nwalk round the ottoman and disappear. I was not much frightened.\nThe next time I saw no figure, but I was more frightened than any\nother time. I was going off next day on a holiday, and I sat up late\nin my room with some sewing. My room was between Miss Morton's\n\f328 Mm M, C, Morton.\nand the schoolroom, on the top floor, where the sounds were apt to be\nworst. I heard a loud noise and looking up I saw the handle of my\ndoor twisted round, as if someone were trying to come in. The door\nwas locked, and this was not a mere slip of the handle. The handle\nwas quite firm and never slipped of itself. I knew that no one was\nup or about and I was motionless with fear. I could scarcely go to bed.\nNext morning when I looked at myself in the glass I saw that one\nside of my face was twisted by a slight stroke. I had been perfectly\nwell the night before, and I could not believe that such a thing\nhad happened, I thought it must be my fancy. But when I went\ndownstairs the other servants saw it. I went for my holiday, Saturday\nto Wednesday, and when I got back I went at once to Dr. F., and he\napplied blisters to my face and it gradually got straight again. He\nsaid that the twisted face might have been caused by a draught as\nwell as by a fright\u2014but I had been in no draught. I have no doubt\nthat it was the fright ; and for some time afterwards my hand was very\nshaky and my nerves upset. But I went on with my work as usual, as\nI knew the thing could not really hurt me.\nI saw it twice more, both times in the drawing-room. Once it was\nas I was lighting the gas, as I had seen it before. The other time was\nwhen I entered the room in the morning and had taken down one\nshutter. I then saw it close by me, and was frightened, and called\nanother servant to come to me. I stayed on in the place and was\nmarried from thence. One housemaid while I was there saw the figure,\nshe said, on the road just outside the gates. She said that she saw\nher face.\nWe often heard someone running down the steps from the approach\nto the back door, and went to open the back door, and found no\none there.\nI often heard noises on the attic landing near my room\u2014scuffling\nand knocking. Sometimes I would hear Miss Rose open her door and\ngo downstairs. I know now that she was following the ghost. But I\nheard her before I knew about the ghost at all.\nM. E.

She is illiterate, and I\ndispensed with her signature, but made notes during my visit from\nwhich this account is taken.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\n\" About 3 years ago, one summer evening between eight and nine,\nwhen it was twilight, I had been at work at the Mortons and was\n\fRecord of a Haunted House.\nwaiting for my pay. I stood at the top of the kitchen stairs, where\nthere is a door into the garden behind the house. I saw a lady pass\nby, rather tall, in black silk, with white collar and cufls, a handkerchief\nin her hand, and a widow's fall. I had heard about the ghost, but it\nnever struck me that this figure could be a ghost\u2014it looked so like an\nordinary person. I thought that someone had come to call and missed\nher way to the door. The family were at tea and I was merely\nwaiting, so out of curiosity I followed the lady round the house. Just\noutside the morning-room window she suddenly disappeared. I was\nquite near her ; it was quite impossible that a real person could have\ngot away.\n\" I went into the house and began telling the housemaid that I had\nseen the ghost. She stopped me,\u2014pointing to the parlourmaid, a new\none, whom they were anxious to keep in ignorance of the ghost\u2014as the\nmaids often left on account of it. The parlourmaid had seen from\none of the windows the same figure, though she had not known that it\nwas the ghost. I believe that she left at the month's end.\n\" I was there when a former parlourmaid, now Mrs. Brown, got the\nfright which caused a stroke so that her face was twisted. I believe\nthat she saw the figure in her bedroom. She had seen it several times\nbefore. She went away by the doctor's orders and then came back and\nmarried from the house.

H. Myers.\nChapter III.\nThe Mechanism of Genius.\nBavaTos itrrtv oKocra tytpOftms opiofiev, OKoaa Be evbovrcs, vnvor.\nHeractjttjs.\nIn. the present series of papers I am endeavouring to trace the\nmanifestations, and to discriminate the powers, of those subjacent strata\nof our being which, although they possess, (as I claim,) a conscious in\ntelligence of their own, nevertheless do not habitually rise above the\nthreshold of our ordinary waking consciousness. I believe that an\nuprush of subliminal faculty may be detected at many points ; and\nmoreover that subliminal perception, memory, power over the organism,\n-\u2014hyperesthesia, hypermnesia, and what we may term hyperboulia,\u2014\nextend over a range wider than that which is covered by the supra\nliminal consciousness with which we identify ourselves in ordinary\nspeech.\nFor the sake of clearness, and of course without pretending to logical\naccuracy, I have arranged these subliminal phenomena in three groups\naccording to the position which they occupy with reference to a\nfigurative spectrum of consciousness,\u2014which is conceived as including,\nbut transcending, the range of perceptivity and of reactive capacity\nwhich is covered by our ordinary supraliminal life.\nSome of these hidden powers, I have said, lie below the physiological\nlimit\u2014call it the red end\u2014of the ordinary conscious spectrum. They\ninvolve, that is to say, an action upon the physical organism profounder\nthan our waking will can exert. Of these powers, especially as revealed\nby hypnotic suggestion, I have spoken in the last chapter. And the\nhyperboulia thus shown,\u2014it is well to remember,\u2014forms the exact\ncontrast to the aboulia, or defect of will-power over the organism, which\nis characteristic of the supraliminal life of the hysterical subject.\nIt is however beyond the other\u2014call it the violet\u2014end of our\nimaginary spectrum that these signs of hidden capacity are mainly to\nbe sought. The bright lines corresponding to telepathy and clairvoy\nance lie above the psychological limit of the range of ordinary con\nsciousness. They involve, that is to say, not so much an increased\npower of the mind over the body as an increased power of one mind\n\f\u00a334 Mr. F, W. H. Myers. '. '.\nover another mind ; or a perceptivity independent of such corporeal\nconditions as limit the perception which we already know. It is from\nthis ultra-violet tract of our spectrum that the themes of our future dis\ncussion will for the most part be drawn.\nBut there,remains, of course, a region of perception. not included in\neither of these two classes,\u2014the region, namely, over which the ordinary\nred to violet spectrum itself extends. If subliminal action be traceable\nbeyond each end of that spectrum, should it not be traceable also along\nthe range of that spectrum itself f I claim that it is so traceable ; and\nin this chapter I shall try to indicate some ways in which the working\nof our ordinary, familiar faculties is reinforced by. impulses or messages\nfrom the consciousness which exists below.\nOur difficulty here will be of a kind somewhat different from that\nwhich we encounter in the two other classes. In the ultra-violet tract, for\ninstance, our difficulty lies in proving that telepathy is a fact in nature.\nIf such a power exist at all, few will deny that its characteristic bright\nline lies far above our ordinary psychological limit. But touch, hearing,\nsight,\u2014these are already appropriated as the functions of the waking\nself. How are we to prove that any exercise of these powers, though\nunusual in degree, is different in kind from our familiar operations 1 If\nit be different, is it not a merely accidental, or even morbid, extension\nof ordinary capacity ? In answer to this question I shall try to show\nthat in the domain of each sense in turn there are \" flashes of inspira\ntion,\" to use the popular term, which surpass the products of conscious\neffort not only in sensory intensity but in intelligent co-ordination, and\nseem to have been elaborated below the threshold by an active and\nreminiscent mind.\nNow these \"flashes of inspiration,\"\u2014-these fugitive bright lines\nreferable to our subliminal strata,\u2014will on this view be likely to be more\nconspicuous when the glare of the supraliminal spectrum is deadened\nby sleep or trance. That is to say, we shall expect that traces of\nhyperesthesia or hypermnesia will be most observable in the hypnotic\ntrance, next in dreams, and least conspicuous in ordinary waking life.\nAnd to this expectation the facts do on the whole correspond. It will\nbe generally admitted, in the first place, that hyperesthesie of all senses\nare wont to occur in the hypnotic trance. This fact, I say, will not be\ndenied; but in most text-books its meaning has been greatly obscured\nby a misdescription depending on one-sided theory. Thus the phrase\n\" cramp of attention \" is often employed, and the subject is supposed\nto be alive to every whisper of his hypnotiser's simply from the fact that\nhis whole mind is directed in that channel, and that he observes nothing\nelse. And this is true enough in many of the simpler cases ;\u2014as in the\nplatform-experiments, where the suggested rapport which keeps the\nsubject's gaze fixed in fascination upon the hypnotiser's eye may well\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness.\nbe described as cramp of attention. But hardly any phrase can be less\nfitting to describe the kind of perceptivity on the subject's part against-\nwhich it is most needful to guard, if, for instance, we are trying an\nexperiment from which all possibilities of external suggestion have to be\nexcluded. It is not the absorbed and staring platform-subject who is\nmost likely to notice the little signs which are not meant for him to\nsee ;\u2014rather it is the lethargic slumberer, who does not wake when\nyou shout at him, nor stir when you stick pins into him,\u2014yet who\nall the while may be treasuring up the most casual words of the\nhypnotiser, ready to act upon them,\u2014in a spirit of no dishonesty, bufe\nof sheer obedience,\u2014when the time comes to exhibit the phenomena,\nwhich he has thus learnt that his physician expects. This capacity has\noften been ignored even by experienced hypnotisersi ; whose error fol\nlowed almost inevitably from their conception of hypnotism as a mere\nmorbid dissociation of ordinary faculties,-\u2014a narrowing of the field of\nattention. Attention was therefore supposed to be contracted in.\nlethargy into a single point,\u2014the mere readiness to wake up again when,\na given stimulus was applied. From the point of view here taken, on\nthe other hand, there is no ground for supposing that because the supra\nliminal self is stilled into abeyance,\u2014because every superficial token,\nof attention or perception has disappeared,\u2014there need be any corre\nsponding stagnation in the deeps below. Any sense whose channel is\nstill left open may continue at work, undemonstratively indeed, but\nperhaps more effectively than ever.\nAny sense, I say, whose channel is open ;\u2014for I do not wish here\nto enter on the question of telepathic or clairvoyant avenues of know\nledge. These I for the present waive ;\u2014but no one familiar with the\nphenomena will deny that, if these powers are waived, much hyper-\nsesthesia at least will remain to be taken account of. In point of fact,\nbelievers in telepathy have often had to argue against strangely\nexaggerated estimates of what hyperesthesia could do. For example, I\nremember that when the SociiSte' de Psychologie Physiologique in Paris\nwere discussing the action a distance exerted by Dr. Gibert upon\nMadame B. at Havre, one distinguished physician, Dr. Ruault, main\ntained that Madame B., at a distance of nearly half a mile from Dr.\nGibert's house, had perceived by auditory hypersesthesia the change in\nthe condition of Dr, Gibert's arteries, caused by his concentrating him\nself upon the act of willing,\u2014and had obeyed that signal arid come to\nhim,\u2014as a war-horse follows the trumpet-call. He who believes in this\nrather than in telepathy has chosen, I think, his horn of the dilemma\namiss ; but I quote the incident to show to what extent the school\ni When the late Edmund Gurney and I first visited the Salpetriere, in 1885, Dr. A.\nVoisin was, if I mistake not, the sole physician there who thought it needful to guard\nagainst impressions thus received in the lethargic state.\n\fMr. F. W. H. Myers,\nwhich is now conservative, as against our telepathic innovations, is\nwilling to push its belief in the hypnotic extension of ordinary sensory\npowers. And I will not occupy further space by dwelling on the\nnumberless instances in which we shall agree with our sometime\nopponents in considering that hypnotic hyperesthesia has in fact been\nat work. I shall take such hyperesthesia of sight, hearing, smell,\ntouch, sensitiveness to heat and cold, ,fec, as an admitted thing ; and\nI shall merely point out that we have here precisely the evidence of\nwhich my thesis of this chapter stands in need ;\u2014evidence, namely,\nthat within the range of the ordinary spectrum,\u2014among the senses\nwhich we familiarly know,\u2014a subliminal perceptivity exists which sur\npasses the supraliminal ;\u2014which kindles the bright lines at least of our\nhabitual spectrum into a more than common glow.\nWere my object merely to win assent to a proposition, I could\nhardly do better than dwell jxt length on these hypnotic phenomena,\nand try to show in detail how little the increased powers can be\ndeduced from any mere narrowing of the channel or concentration of\nthe output of known waking capacity. My task, however, in these\npapers is one of exploration rather than of exposition. I wish rather\nto discuss in instructive connection all the phenomena which I can link\ntogether than to arrange them in a rigid series. And I pass on to the\ninquiry,\u2014(from my special standpoint a less promising one),\u2014whether\nany of these uprushes of subliminal capacity, within the limits of our\nordinary spectrum, are noticeable apart from dream or trance, and in\nordinary waking hours.\nIt so happens, as we shall presently observe, that one special group\nof these uprushes of subliminal capacity,\u2014those, namely, which per\nform the marvels which make an \"arithmetical prodigy,\"\u2014have\nattracted enough attention to furnish us with several pertinent ex\namples of our present theory. But for specimens of some other kinds\nof these uprushes we must depend for the present upon mere chance\nrecords ;\u2014since no one as yet, so far as I can discover, has thought\nsuch experiences worth collecting.\nBefore we proceed to the highly-specialised senses of hearing and\nsight, let us see whether we can find traces of subliminal intensification\nof those perceptions of a less specialised kind which underlie our more\nelaborate modes of cognising the world around us. The sense of the\nefflux of lime, and the sense of weight, or of muscular resistance, are\namongst the profoundest elements in our organic being. And the sense\nof time is indicated in several ways as a largely subliminal faculty.\nThere is much evidence to show that it is often more exact in men\nsleeping than in men awake, and in men hypnotised than in men\nsleeping. The records of spontaneous somnambulism are full of pre\ndictions made by the .subject as to his own case, and accomplished,\n\fThe Subliwvinal Consciousness. 337\npresumably by self-suggestion, but without help from clocks, at the\nprecise minute foretold. Or this hidden knowledge may take shape in\nthe imagery of dream, as in a case published by Professor Boyce, of\nHarvard,i where his correspondent describes \" a dream in which I saw\nan enormous flaming clock-dial with the hands standing at 2.20.\nAwaking immediately, I struck a match, and upon looking at my watch\nfound it was a few seconds past 2.20.\"\nI should, however, have been puzzled to produce any clear example\nof the subliminal time-sense as manifesting itself in a sane and waking\nperson had not a Mr. Higton sent to me some years ago the following\nrecord of personal experiences on which he desired my opinion. I made\nhis acquaintance, and found him a sensible, serious witness ; but I did\nnot then perceive the full significance of his communication, and I have,\nunfortunately, lost sight of him.\nP. 138.\nMr. W. Higton, 27, St. Leonard-street, Pimlico, S.W., sends me,\nSeptember, 1889, the following experiences\u2014abbreviated from a long paper\nwhich I have returned to him.\n1. \"It is now some three years since the exact time of day presented itself\nto my mind independently of any internal knowledge or of any external\nphysical appearances \" (as of clock, &c).\nMr. Higton had no idea of the exact time, when \" within a few yards of\nTattersall's there instantaneously appeared before me the face of a clock of\nan immense size. Every figure was perfectly visible ; and the huge black\nhands distinctly indicated 11.25 ; while at the same moment or, correctly\nspeaking, a fraction of a second later, I felt convinced and absolutely cer\ntain that the time indicated on the dial was the right time \" (as in fact it was\nby his watch). \"The phenomenon has recurred during the past 3 years at\nleast 5 and, I think, 6 times ; the first 3 occurring at intervals of about 3\nmonths, and the last 2 or 3 being divided by a considerably longer interval.\"\n2. On another occasion Mr. Higton was walking through a field as to\nwhich a legend ran that a young lady was murdered there, while she held a\nsprig of thyme, and that anyone passing through the field and not thinking\nof the murder would smell thyme. Mr. Higton paid no credit to this legend;\n\u2014often walked through the field, but thought about the murder. \"How\never, I did walk through the field one gloomy November afternoon, absorbed\nso deeply in some new practical scheme that I did not think about the\nmurder, and most certainly should not have thought about it if the strongest\nconceivable smell of thyme that ever rose to human nostrils had not risen\nto mine. The odour of it lasted at least a quarter of a minute, until my\nconcentrated thoughts were disorganised, and made to dwell on the magical\nsubject.\"\n3. \" When I was at home assisting my father in his business it used to\nbe my work to weigh the hides which were taken from the beasts we killed,\npreparatory to sending them to the dealer ; and it was my custom before\ni Procttdingt of American S.P.R., No. p. 360.\n\f338 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nplacing tbem in the scale to see how near the weight I would guess them to\nbe. By this means I became tolerably expert in estimating their weight,\ninvariably being not more than 3 or 4 pounds out. Now on several\noccasions before I guessed, or even thought of guessing, a certain weight\ncame into my mind which (as in the case of the time indicated on the dial)\nI was inwardly assured was correct. I remember one case distinctly, in\nwhich the hide weighed 87jib. , which were the exact figures which occurred\nto me prior to weighing, and independently of any computation whatever.\nIndeed, on one occasion, the fourth, I think, I ventured to ticket the hide,\nwithout weighing it, in accordance with the figures which came into my\nmind ; and on the following Tuesday exactly the number of pounds named\non the ticket were paid for at the market to which the hides were delivered.\nAs you will easily believe, I did not tell my father I had not weighed the\nhide on the ground that I knew the weight without doing so ! \" i\nSetting aside for the moment the .hallucination of the sense of\nsmell, I would point out that we have here precisely such uprushes of\nsubliminal faculty, concerned with the deep organic sensations of the\nefflux of time and of muscular resistance, as theory had led us to expect.\nWe need not postulate any direct or supernormal knowledge,\u2014but\nmerely a subliminal calculation, such as we shall see in the case of\n''arithmetical prodigies,\" expressing itself supraliminally, sometimes in a\nphantasmal picture, sometimes as a mere \" conviction,\" without sensory\nclothing. And I would interpret in much the same way the story of\nthe smell of thyme in the haunted field. We may suppose, I think,\nthat although Mr. Higton was not \" consciously \" thinking of the local\nlegend, his subliminal self remembered it, and produced the appropriate\nhallucination of smell in the same way in which it produced the\npicture of the clock-face, as indicating that it knew the precise hour.\nThus we have, I think, a reasonable explanation of what seems at\nfirst sight an extravagant ghost story ;\u2014an explanation which is the\nmore probable insomuch as it is deduced from our own analysis of\nMr. Higton's evidence, and does not seem to have occurred to himself.\nIn somewhat the same way I should be disposed to explain certain\n'\u2022' monitions \" of impending illness, or even death, which may occur\ni Mr. Higton has also had coincidences in the matter of meeting people in the\nstreets ; but such coincidences are difficult to make evidential. The following moni\ntion, however, deserves record. \" Walking towards my lodgings about 3 years ago,\nthe conviction seized me that if I went my usual way I should meet a friend whom I\ngreatly desired just then not to meet. I therefore, without hesitation, took another\nroad, and having arrived at one of the street corners, whom should I see\nat the end of the street but my friend, walking down the road on which, but for\nmy premonition, I should have met him. Whether he was in the habit of taking that\nparticular road at that time of day, or not, I cannot say ; as only on one occasion,\nbefore had I met him out of doors ; and that was almost a mile distant from the street\nnow referred to. Besides, I knew absolutely nothing about either his business or his\nhabits ; and, bo it remembered, my premonition was not an idea\u2014a conjecture\u2014but\nan instantaneous intimation to my soul.\"\n\fThe Subliminal. Consciousness. 339\nwhile the supraliminal self is unconscious of any danger. In the\nfollowing case, for instance, Lady Eardley's subliminal self may have\nforeseen the impending fainting fit, and generated the hallucinatory\nvoice which averted the perhaps fatal result.\nP. 139.\nWhen I was a girl of about sixteen I had a mild attack of measles. I was\nstaying with my godfather and godmother. After two or three days in my\nroom I was told that I might have a warm bath ; greatly pleased, and feel\ning well again, I went to the bathroom, locked the door, undressed, and was\njust about to get into the bath, when I heard a voice say \" Unlock the door. \"\nThe voice was quite distinct and apart from myself and yet seemed to come\nsomehow from inside myself. I could not say whether it was a man's or\na woman's voice. I was startled, and looked round, but of course no ono\nwas there. Again I heard the voice, \"Unlock the door.\" I began to get\nfrightened, thinking that I must be ill and delirious\u2014but I did not feel ill.\nI resolved not to think of the voice, and had stepped into the bath, when I\nheard it a third time\u2014and I think a fourth time\u2014still saying \" Unlock the\ndoor.\" On this I jumped out and I did unlock the door ; and then stepped\ninto the bath again. As I got in, I fainted away and fell flat down in the\nwater. Fortunately as I fell I was just able to catch at a bell-handle, which\nwas attached to the wall just above the bath. My pull brought the maid,\nwho found me (she said) lying with my head under water. She picked mo\nup and carried me out of the bathroom\u2014knocking my head against the\ndoorpost as she did so, which brought me partly round for a moment. If\nthe door had been locked I should certainly have been drowned, as far as I\ncan tell.\nI have never heard a similar voice or had any other hallucination what\never, i\nAt one time, however, I had a curious extension of ordinary powers of\nhearing. I was in a state of great nervous prostration, from mental distress and\nothercauses, and was lying in bed on the second floor front room in a house in\na London street. Under ordinary circumstances I cannot from this room hear\nany letters fall into the letterbox. [I tried this experiment and could not\nhear letters fall in.\u2014F.W.H.M.] But during this illness I not only could\nhear them fall, but I seemed to know from whom each letter came. I felt\na sort of shock at the heart as each fell, and would say to my maid (who\nis dead) \"there is a letter from my lawyer,\" or such other person as\nthe case might be. Of these letters some were more or less expected by me\nbut others not. Yet I knew at once from whom they came. As I grew\nbetter and stronger the power of distinguishing the letters left me ; but for\nsome time yet I could hear the letters being dropped into the box.\nE. F. De Lousada\n(Lady Eardley).\nAnd here among the vaguer or less measurable modes of sensation\nsome brief mention may be made of various ill-established or ill-under\nstood sensory powers, which, if they exist, seem to belong mainly to.\nsubliminal strata. Such is the metall&sthesia, or sensitiveness to\n\f340 Mr. F. W. Hr Myers.\nspecial metals, so often described in hysterical cases, especially in\nFrance. Such is the dubious \" magnetic sense,\" widely believed in in\nFrance, with its possible extensions to crystals, &c, if Reichenbach's.\nisolated experiments are to be trusted. Such is \" meteorological\nsensitiveness,\" which recognises or anticipates the changes of the\nbarometer. Such, too, is the apparent sensibility of certain persons to\nthe nearness of underground water. Unless the accounts printed in\nProceedings, Vol. II., and elsewhere are due to accident and exaggera\ntion,\u2014(for there are many which wilful fraud will not explain),\u2014we\nmust apparently suppose that some physical indications of the near\nness of water, subliminally apprehended, produce in the \" dowser \" an\nautomatic impulse which prompts him unconsciously to twist the\n\" divining-rod,\" in just the same way as it prompts automatic writers to\nmove the pencil. But on all this controversial matter I must not here\ndwell. Suffice it to say that if any of these forms of sensitivity be estab\nlished they will be additional instances of capacity mainly if not\nwholly exercised by the subliminal self, and emerging into supraliminal\nexistence in ways which no conscious calculation can foretell. Such\npowers, in my metaphor, will be represented by the conversion of dark\nlines into bright lines within the limits of our habitual spectrum. For\nthey differ in kind both from hyperesthesia of known senses and from\nsuch novelties as telepathy and clairvoyance. Thus hyperesthesia of the\nsense of contact, for instance, is the mere extra brightening of a line in\nour spectrum already bright. But metallsesthesia (if not depending on\nintensified perceptions of temperature, surface, &c.) is the substitution\nof a bright line for a dark one,\u2014though in the vicinity of the bright\ntactile lines already familiar. We cannot at any rate assume that its\nline, like the novel bright line of telepathy, will lie clearly beyond the\npsychological end of our spectrum. Whereas in telepathy we get at\nsomething genetically unlike our known senses, in metallsesthesia we get\nat something cognate to our known senses ;\u2014as it were a sense which\nhas dropped out from among its congeners, or has not yet taken its due\nplace among them. Metallsesthesia, like telepathy itself, will thus repre\nsent one of the n original capacities of protoplasm, of which capacities\na small proportion only may have been developed into definiteness by\nthe training which protoplasm has up to this date undergone.\nBut let us pass on from these lower forms of sensitiveness to the\nhigher, the more intellectual senses of hearing and sight. And\nhere our first reflection will be that as a form of sense becomes more\nintellectual, its internal operation,\u2014the form of imagination, as we\nsay, connected with it,\u2014gains rapidly in complexity and importance.\nInternal audition, internal visualisation, are for our present argument\neven more significant than the perception of sounds and sights outside us.\nBut to begin with external hearing. Hypnotic hyperacuity of hearing is\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 341\nalready familiar. The same phenomenon has been frequently observed\nin spontaneous somnambulism, in hysteria, and in various morbid\nconditions. An experiment of Dessoir's, already noticed in these\nProceedings, shows, (in close analogy to the phenomena of crystal-\nvision,) that sounds which fall unnoticed on the waking ear may be all\nthe while intelligently treasured up in some hypnotic or other sub\nliminal stratum. Mr. X., absorbed in his book amongst friends who\nwere talking, was suddenly roused to attention by catching his own\nname. He asked what his friends had been saying of him. No reply\nwas made, but he was hypnotised. In the hypnotic trance he was\nable to repeat the whole conversation which his waking self had missed.\nStill more remarkable is the fact, shown by the late Edmund Gurney\nand other observers, that the hypnotised subject can pick out the\ndistant whisper of his hypnotiser from amidst a Babel of unnoticed\nsounds made by persons with whom he is not in rapport. It is\nabundantly clear that the external audition of the hypnotic or other\nsubliminal strata may greatly exceed in delicacy the external audition\nof common life.\nLet us now turn to internal audition ;\u2014to the sounds which we\nimagine within us ;\u2014and let us consider by what test the degree of\nsuch audition is capable of being estimated. The good audile (more\nstrictly auditile) subject of Galton will differ from the bad one in two\nprincipal ways,\u2014namely, in the intensity and in the complexity of his\nintra-cerebral i sensations of sound. That is to say, the good auditile\nwill summon up the sound of voices, ifec, more easily and more dis\ntinctly than other men ; and he will also be better able than others\nto recollect and represent to himself complex sequences or co-existences\nof sound. We shall find subliminal faculty markedly in excess of\nsupraliminal in each of these directions,\u2014in the intensity of internal\naudition, which leads to hallucination ; and in the complexity of in\nternal audition, which leads to poetic and musical genius.\nLet us take first the intensity, or apparent externalisation, of\nimagined sounds. We do not, of course, here encounter hallucinations\nfor the first time. Not hearing and sight alone, but every sense, may\nbe hypnotically stimulated into a vividness which refuses to believe that\nthe excitement proceeds only from within. We can produce hallucina\ntions of heat, cold, weight, contact, pain, smell, taste. In each case\nthe intensity of the sensation thus emerging from its subliminal factory\nmay be far greater than any intensity of similar sensation which con-\n.scious supraliminal effort can initiate or maintain. All this is familiar\nx On the analogy of \"entoptic\" and \"entotlc\" these inward auditions might\n.conveniently be described as \"entencephalic,\"\u2014leaving \"intra-cerebral,\" like\n\"intra-ocular,\" to express objective or material arrangements or changes within\n\u2022eye or brain.\n\f342 Mr. F. W. IT. Myern.\nto every observer of hypnotism ; but few observers have as yet grasped\nthe important lesson which even the commonest platform phenomena\nshould teach ;\u2014namely, that the hypnotic self is here performing a\nsensory function beyond the possible achievement of the ordinary\nwaking self. One of the causes of this ignoring of the true signifi\ncance of . hallucinations has been (as I have elsewhere observed)\nthe fact that when they occur spontaneously it is often in connection\nwith morbid states. Inquiry into human vital phenomena has usually\nbeen undertaken with a therapeutic and not with a purely scientific\npurpose ; and consequently the morbid aspect of hallucination, although\nreally accidental, has been insisted upon in preference to its absolute\npsychological significance. This is eminently the case with regard to\nthe hallucinations of hearing,\u2014imaginary voices, &c.,-\u2014with which we\nare at this moment concerned. Frequently accompanying insanity,\nthey have been discussed as though they were simply an indication of\ninsanity. How narrow and imperfect such a view of them is I have\ntried to show in a previous paper on \" The Dcemon of Socrates \" (Pro\nceedings, Vol. V., p. 522), to which I must here be content to refer\nthe reader. He will there, I hope, find some reason for supposing that\nthat intensification of internal audition which at last suggests exter\nnality in the imagined voices may sometimes succeed in manifesting no\ndisease or disintegration, but rather a subliminal faculty to which the\nsupraliminal may be glad to appeal.\nIt is, however, the other branch of internal audition,\u2014that which\ninvolves complexity rather than intensity of imagined sounds,\u2014which\noffers, so to say, the richest opportunities for subliminal manifestation,\n\u2014the readiest vent-holes for the uprush of the hidden fire. The\nsounds that rise within our waking consciousness from a source beyond\nthe will do not confine themselves to the mere shaping of scattered\nsentences,\u2014the airy syllabling of phrases that tend to nought. There\nis an inward consonance, an obscure concent, which forms the ground\nwork of Poetry, the fount of Song,\u2014the cradle from whence those\n\" sphere-born harmonious sisters, Voice and Verse,\" issue in preformed\ndivinity into the common day. This is true not only for Song, strictly\nso termed, but also for Poetry unaccompanied by music ;\u2014that is to\nsay, for interrelations of rhythm and articulation taken apart from\ninterrelations of pitch, definite time-intervals, or timbre. For the true\npoet,\u2014as Goethe has somewhere said,\u2014the melody of his coming poem\nfloats as a self-created and impalpable entity within him, before words\nhave shaped themselves or thought itself is born. Jo mi son un, said a,\ngreater even than Goethe,\u2014\nIo mi son un, che quando\nAmore spira, noto, ed a quel modo\nChe detta dentro, vo significando. ,\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 343\nAnd here a reflection may be made which, while it clears up (as\nseems to me) an old confusion, will also well illustrate the latent\ncapacities of the subliminal consciousness ;\u2014its power to convey potent\nand intimate messages through mechanism of the slenderest kind. We\nknow that as we advance from sounds non-human to human sounds,\nfrom sounds non-vocal to sounds which the human throat can produce,\nour conception of any given sound increasingly needs, to make it com\nplete, a motor as well as an auditory representation within us. Our\ngrasp, say, of the word London is imperfect if we cannot articulate the\nword with our mind's voice as well as hear it with our mind's ear.\nIn all definite inward audition there is, then, probably a motor\nelement as well as a sensory. And I hold that one difference between\nimagined poetry and imagined music or song lies in the fact that\nimagined verbal rhythm may be almost wholly motor, while imagined\ntunes must be largely sensory as well. To those, then, who are per\nplexed at the fact that many poets have lacked musical ear it may be\nanswered that the mental imagery of such poets may have been mainly\nmotile ;\u2014-may have consisted in a delicate imagination of such laryngeal\nmovements as are concerned in the utterance of melodious speech. I\nbelieve that with careful self-observation many men with \" an ear for\nverse \" will recognise that the essential part of poetic excitation has lain\nin scarcely perceptible changes of tension in the muscles of the throat.\nThe rhythmical modulations, indeed, have their birth beyond the will ;\nbut it is about that physical centre of imagined utterance that the emo\ntional stress will gather and the inexplicable promptings throng; through\nthat motor channel the reverberating tremors rise and fall ;\u2014and flood\nthe flats of common consciousness as with the earthquake-wave of an\nunfathomed sea.\nAnd there is yet another and even stranger form of inward audition.\nThere exists among men a mighty complex of conceptions which lie\napart from,\u2014some say beyond,\u2014articulate speech and reasoned thought.\nThere is a march and uprising through ideal spaces which some hold as\nthe only true ascent ; there is an architecture which some count as alone\nabiding,\u2014\nseeing it is built\nOf music, therefore never built at all,\nAndj therefore, built for ever.\n'Whether considered in regard to its development in the race, or to\nits activity in the individual, Music resembles not so much a product\nof terrene needs and of natural selection as a subliminal capacity attain\ning to an accidental manifestation independently of the requirements or\nof the external stimuli of the supraliminal self. We know the diffi\nculty of explaining its rise on any current theory of the evolution of\nhuman faculty. We know that it is like something discovered, not like\n\f344 Mi: F. W.H. Myers.\nsomething manufactured \u2022;\u2014like wine found in a walled-up cellar, rather\nthan like furniture made in the workshop above. And the subjec\ntive sensations of the musician himself accord with this view of the\nessentially subliminal character of the gift with which he deals. In no\ndirection is \" genius \" or \" inspiration \" more essential to true success.\nIt is not from careful poring over the mutual relations of musical notes\nthat the masterpieces of melody have been born. They have come as\n.they came to Mozart,\u2014whose often-quoted words I need not cite again,\n\u2014in an uprush of unsummoned audition, of unpremeditated and self-\nrevealing joy. They have come, as to Browning's Abt Vogler, with a\nsense of irrecoverable commingling of depths of soul and heights\nof heaven.i Translating the phrases of poetry into such terms as we\nhere employ, we may say that we have reached a point where the sub\nliminal uprush is felt by the supraliminal personality to be deeper,\ntruer, more permanent than the products of voluntary thought. In\nthe genesis of poetry and of music we have gained a first glimpse into\nthe mechanism of genius. But before generalising further, we have yet\nto consider the subliminal operation of the most intellectual, the most\ndelicately measurable sense of all ; the sense whose internal operation\nmay perhaps be the deepest inlet, as its external is the farthest^reaching\nexcursion, into the reality of things.\nI need not dwell on the hypera;sthesie of external vision so often\nnoted in association with hysteria, with spontaneous somnambulism,\nwith the hypnotic trance. The difficulties to which they introduce us\nshow no sign of early or easy solution. Precisely in the region where\nthe anatomical, the optical, limits appear most definite we have the\n'most unpredictable, the most capricious extensions of faculty. I will\ngive here two cases in which, as I conceive, the subliminal self has\nobserved what the supraliminal has failed to notice, and has generated\na hallucination, in order to check the mistaken action to which that\ninadvertence was leading. In the first case, all that needs correction is\na mere act of distraction,-\u2014a failure to look carefully at an object fully\nin sight. In the second case it appears as though the subliminal\nactually saw better than the supraliminal self.\nP. 140.\nFrom Mrs. E. K. Elliott, wife of the Rev. E. K.

Elliott.\nThe following incident was recorded in the Boston Budget by the '\npercipient herself, a lady well known to Mr. Hodgson.\nP. 141.\nThe Boston Budget, August 31\u00bbf, 1890.\nA strange incident occurred one night last week at one of the Boston Back\nBay hotels. It was just before the gas was lighted, and was already growing\ndusky in the corridors, when a resident guest stepped out of her room to go\nto the elevator. She touched the electric bell and then went down to the end\nof another corridor to look out of the window for a moment, while the\nelevator was coming up. Returning to it, she was about advancing pre\ncipitately to the side of it that the door was on, when the sight of a man\nstanding exactly in front of the elevator door caused her to stop short, that\nshe might not be so rude or awkward as to run into him, so to speak, as she\nwas in danger of doing in her rather heedless haste. The hall was dim, but\na window opposite the elevator showed the form of the man plainly enough,\nand the lady waited at a decorous distance. But what was her amazement\nwhen the elevator came up, brightly lighted inside, to see, first, that the\nupper door was wide open, and that thus the entire well of the elevator\nwas exposed. The lady had been a guest for many years in the house,\nand had never known such a thing as an elevator door left open to happen\nbefore. But the second fact was far more startling, there was no man\nthere! Now, the appearance of this man, or her impression of his appear\nance there, undoubtedly saved her from plunging head first down the\nelevator well.\nThe rapidity with which she was rushing toward the elevator\u2014with the\ntrue national haste that characterises every movement of the American, and\nmakes him crowd to the door of the cars before a train stops, that he may be\nthe first one out\u2014with the true spirit of her country she was rushing towards\nthe elevator with a haste whose momentum would almost certainly have\ncarried her into the fatal well, had not the appearance of the man standing\nthere checked her steps, and caused a sudden accession of demure dignity\n2 A\n\f346 Mr. F.

Now, here is a\nfact for Dr. Richard Hodgson and his Psychical Society. It may be added\nthat the lady in question immediately went to the hotel desk to report the\nterrible carelessness of the boy who had left this door open, but not ambitious\nto acquire the reputation of a lunatic, or even a seer of visions or dreamer\nof dreams, she took very good care not to relate the other half of the occur\nrence, although it was just as palpable a fact as the material fact that the\ndoor was open. Was this the apparition of a spiritual presence, which had\nmaterialised to save her from a terrible fate 1 Who shall say ?\nBoston, September 5th, 1890.\nMy dear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014No, I did not recognise the form at all. I\nsimply didn't notice\u2014didn't think anything about it, as it is rather the rnle\nthan the exception to meet people at the elevator in a hotel. Then, too, I\nam very near-sighted, and I did not have my eye-glasses on, so I shouldn't\nhave recognised even my most intimate friend in the dusky light and at the\nlittle distance.\nIt occurred on Tuesday night, August 26th.\n\u2022 ..\u25a0..\u00ab\u2022f\nFaithfully yours,\n(Signed) A. B.\nThe account in the Budget was written by the witness herself, a lady well\nknown to me.\u2014R. H.\nAssuming this second incident to be correctly reported, the least\nmarvellous way of explaining it will perhaps be to suppose that\nMiss A. B.'s subliminal self perceived the open doorway at a distance\nsomewhat beyond the eyesight of her supraliminal self, and then\ngenerated the hallucinatory figure in order to avert the fall.\nSuch an explanation of course takes for granted that the subliminal\nstrata possess a power which the supraliminal can rarely rival ;\u2014the\npower, namely, of externalising a hallucination,\u2014of projecting from\nsome hidden workshop a lifelike figure amid the actual surroundings,\nand into the common day. And indeed this point is probably too\nfamiliar to my readers to need further insistence here. The question\nreally before us is not simply whether the subliminal self can generate\nhallucinatory pictures,\u2014a fact of which the most ordinary post-hypnotic\nsuggestion will furnish ample proof. Rather we wish to understand\nhow much intelligence these pictures imply ;\u2014to discover how far\nexperiment can be pushed in the way of evoking or modifying them.\nAnd here I must pause to introduce a passage which I only came\nupon when this chapter was nearly completed ;\u2014but which seems to me\nto give in germ the very theory for which I am now contending, on the\nauthority of one of the most lucid thinkers of the last generation.\nThe passage occurs in an article by Sir John Herschel on Sensorial\nVision, in his Familiar Lectures on Scientific Subjects, 1816. Sir\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 347\nJohn describes some experiences of his own, \" which consist in the\ninvoluntary production of visual impressions, into which geometrical\nregularity of form enters as the leading character, and that, under\ncircumstances which altogether preclude any explanation drawn from a\npossible regularity of structure in the retina or the optic nerve.\"i Twice\nthese patterns appeared in waking daylight hours,\u2014with no illness or\ndiscomfort at the time or afterwards. More frequently they appeared\nin darkness ; but still while Sir John was fully awake. They appeared\nalso twice when he was placed under chloroform ; \" and I should\nobserve that I never lost my consciousness of being awake, and in full\npossession of my mind, though quite insensible to what was going\non. . . . Now the question at once presents itself\u2014What are these\nGeometrical Spectres ? and how, and in what department of the bodily\nor mental economy do they originate ? They are evidently not dreams.\nThe mind is not dormant, but active and conscious of the direction of'\nits thoughts ; while these things obtrude themselves on notice, and by\ncalling attention to them, direct the train of thought into a channel it\nwould not have taken of itself. . . . If it be true that the con- '\nception of a regular geometrical pattern implies the exercise of thought\nand intelligence, it would almost seem that in such cases as those above\nadduced we have evidence of a thought, an intelligence, working within\nour own organisation distinct from that of our own personality.\" And\nSir John further suggests that these complex figures, entering the mind\nin this apparently arbitrary fashion, throw light upon \" the suggestive\nprinciple \" to which \" we must look for much that is determinant and\ndecisive of our volition when carried into action.\" \" It strikes me as\nnot by any means devoid of interest to contemplate cases where, in a\nmatter so entirely abstract, so completely devoid of any moral or\nemotional bearing, as the production of a geometrical figure, we, as it\nwere, seize upon that principle in the very act, and in the performance\nof its office.\"\nFrom my point of view, of course, I can but admire the acumen\nwhich enabled this great thinker to pierce to the root of the matter, by\nthe aid of so few observations. He does not even seem to have per\nceived the connection between these \" schematic phantasms,\" to borrow\na phrase from Professor Ladd,2 and the hallucinatory figures of men or\nanimals seen in health or in disease. But even from his scanty data\nhis inference seems to me irresistible ;\u2014\" we have evidence of a\nthought, an intelligence, working within our own organisation, distinct\nfrom that of our own personality.\" I shall venture to claim him as the\ni On this point see James' P$ychology, Vol. II., p. 84, note. Goethe's well-\nknown phantasmal flower was clearly no mere representation of retinal structure. A\nnear analogy to these patterns lies in the so-called \" spirit-drawings,\" or automatic\narabesques, which I hope to discuss in a later paper.\nJ See Professor Ladd's paper on this subject in Mind, April, 1892.\n2 A 2\n\fMr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfirst originator of the theory to which the far fuller evidence now acces\nsible had independently led myself.\nThese visions of Sir John Herschel's seem to have been intermediate,\nso far as apparent externalisation was concerned, between ordinary\nmind's eye visions, and those full-fledged hallucinatory quasi-percepts\nwhich seem to occupy a definite place in the room, and to hide the\nchair on which they sit. Perhaps their nearest parallel lies in the\ncrystal-visions to which I have repeatedly called attention. This\nempirical method of inducing hallucinations, by concentration of mind,\naided by gazing into some clear depth or dark mirror, has already illus\ntrated with singular vividness many forms of that \" subliminal uprush \"\nwith which this chapter is concerned. It has been found that, just as\nautomatic writing systematises and renders intelligible the vague\nimpulses of motor automatism, so also does this steady gaze at once\neduce, clarify, and prolong those incipient intensifications of internal\npercepts which the subliminal self seems ever ready to develop, but\nwhich are usually dissipated before they attain to the consistency\neither of dream or of waking hallucination. Crystal-vision, however,\nhas hardly yet been received within the purview of science. The first\nattempt so to introduce it,\u2014the series of experiments printed in Pro\nceedings, Vol. V., p. 486, sqq.,\u2014has not as yet led to any wide imitation.\nAnd since in this chapter I am carefully excluding all supernormal or\nstrongly-controverted phenomena, I will here mention one only of the\nforms of subliminal faculty which these experiments illustrated ;\u2014a\nform which can be paralleled from ordinary psycho-physical experiment,\nand from the experience of conspicuous and well-known persons. I\nallude to the hypermnesia of crystal-vision ;\u2014shown in three ways :\n(1) the power of reproducing facts once known, but forgotten, (2) the\npower of presenting conclusions without awareness of the intermediate\nsteps, and (3) the power of reproducing facts never consciously known to\nthe supraliminal self, although they may at some time have fallen\nwithin the field of external vision. These powers, although bearing\nsomewhat different relations to ordinary memory, are found so much\nintermingled in practice that I must stretch the term hypermnesia to\ninclude them all.\nI regard this hypermnesia as eminently a subliminal faculty, of which\nexamples of many kinds will present themselves as we proceed. And\nI begin here by quoting an ingenious experiment by which Dr. Scripture,\nof Clark University, has shown that in the most ordinary act of vision\nwe must discriminate between that which is remembered by the super\nficial consciousness and that which remains,\u2014hidden, but educible,\u2014in\nsome depth below.1\ni Scripture, Ueber den associativen Vorlauf der Voratellungen, Leipzig, 1891 1\np. 90, igq.\n\fThe Subliminal. ConsciouAness. 349\nDr. Scripture shows to the percipient a card with a picture in the\nmiddle and a small letter of the alphabet printed beneath the picture.\nThe exposure is so short that the percipient observes only the main\npicture, and has no conscious knowledge whatever of the letter of the\nalphabet. Yet when afterwards the letter is shown by itself to the\npercipient, it often recalls,\u2014gradually, but at last distinctly,\u2014the\npicture of star or elephant or whatever it may have been which was on\nthe centre of the card in whose corner the letter was printed. It often\nhappens that the percipient cannot tell in what way this obscure\nassociation of letter and picture has been effected. He merely feels that\nthere is a connection, say between the letter M and the elephant. \" Er\nhatte nur ein Gefiihl der Richtigkeit.\" The subliminal self, as I should\nexpress it, has sent up its message in a feeble current, not yet articu\nlated into sensory terms.\nIn this happy contrivance we have both the advantages and the\ndisadvantages of a laboratory experiment as contrasted with a spon\ntaneous incident. We have great definiteness in the upheaval of\nsubliminal memories, but that upheaval is on the very smallest scale.\nThe pictures which escape the notice of the supraliminal self are retained\nby the subliminal for but a short time, and at a short distance below\nthe threshold. They resemble pebbles which the earthworm sucks into\nits burrow and re-ejects upon the lawn, rather than an uprushing lava-\nstream from caves of hidden fire. They represent, one may say, the\nfirst stage of a process which, although often inconspicuous, is not\nlikely to be discontinuous,\u2014the sustenance, namely, of the supraliminal\nlife by impulse or guidance from below.\nI pass on to an example on a larger scale of subliminal visualisa\ntion, subliminal hypermnesia, which Nature herself has again and again\nsupplied ;\u2014involving the hidden manipulation of mind's-eye pictures\nof great complexity.\nOn this topic again we shall find help in work done by Dr. Scrip\nture ; although he has here worked with a different object, and has\nindicated no connection between his two inquiries.\nDuring the course of the present century,\u2014and alas ! the scientific\nobservation of unusual specimens of humanity hardly runs back farther,\nor so far,\u2014the public of great cities has been from time to time sur\nprised and diverted by some so-called \" calculating boy,\" or \" arith\nmetical prodigy,\" generally of tender years, and capable of performing\n\" in his head,\" and almost instantaneously, problems for which ordinary\nworkers would require pencil and paper and a much longer time. In\nsome few cases, indeed, the ordinary student would have no means\nwhatever of solving the problem which the calculating boy unriddled\nwith ease and exactness. These calculating boys have simply been\nnoted as anomalies, and no attempt (so far as I can find) has been made\n\f350 Mr. F. TP. H. Myers.\nto explain their powers, that is to say, to include this special gift\nunder any wider generalisation. Recently, indeed, Dr. Scripture has\nmade a careful attempt to collect the hints or explanations which these\nprodigies have given of their methods of work ; methods which one\nmight naturally expect to be of use in ordinary education.i For our\npresent purpose that task, although needful, was only preliminary. We\nwish to know how much of his achievement the phenomenal calculator\ncan explain, mainly in order that we may realise how much remains\ninexplicable to himself as to others.\nAnd the records left to us, imperfect as they are, are enough to show\nthat the main and primary achievement has in fact been subliminal,\nwhile conscious or supraliminal effort has sometimes been wholly absent,\nsometimes has supervened only after the gift has been so long exercised\nthat the accesses between different strata have become easy by frequent\ntraversing. The prodigy grown to manhood, who now recognises the\narithmetical artifices which he used unconsciously as a boy, resembles\nthe hypnotic subject trained by suggestion to remember in waking\nhours the events of the trance.\nIn almost every point, indeed, where comparison is possible we shall\nfind this computative gift resembling other manifestations of subliminal\nfaculty,\u2014such as the power of seeing hallucinatory figures,\u2014rather than\nthe results of steady supraliminal effort,\u2014such as the power of logical\nanalysis. In the first place, this faculty, in spite of its obvious connec\ntion with general mathematical grasp and insight, is found almost at\nrandom,\u2014among non-mathematical and even quite stupid persons, as\nwell as among mathematicians of mark. In the second place, it shows\nitself mostly in early childhood, and tends to disappear in later life ;\u2014in\nthis resembling visualising power in general, and the power of seeing\nhallucinatory figures in particular, which powers, as both Mr. Galton's\ninquiries and our own tend to show, are habitually stronger in child\nhood and youth than in later years. Again, it is noticeable that when\nthe power disappears early in life it is apt to leave behind it no memory\nwhatever of the processes involved. And even when, by long persistence\nin a reflective mind, the power has become, so to say, adopted into the\nsupraliminal consciousness, there nevertheless may still be flashes of\npure \"inspiration,\" when the answer \"comes into the mind\" with\nabsolutely no perception of intermediate steps. I subjoin a table,\ncompiled by help of Dr. Scripture's collection, which will broadly\nillustrate the main points above mentioned. Some more detailed\nremarks may then follow.2\ni \" Arithmetical Prodigies,\" in American Journal of Psychology, Vol. IV., No. 1.\n(April, 1891.)\n2 No adequate account of Jacques Inaudi,\u2014the present \"prodigy,\"\u2014has as yet\ncome under my notice.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 351\nTable of Principal Arithmetical Prodigies. .\nName (alphabetically).

After manifesting itself at an age when there is\nusually no continuous supraliminal mental effort worth speaking of, it\nappears to have been soon merged in the general blaze of their genius.\nWith Bidder the gift persisted through life, but grew weaker as he grew\nolder. His paper in Vol. XV. of the Proceedings of (he Institute of\nCivil Engineers, while furnishing a number of practical hints to the\ncalculator, indicates also a singular readiness of communication between\ndifferent mental strata. \" Whenever,\" he says (p. 255), \" I feel called\nupon to make use of the stores of my mind, they seem to rise with the\nrapidity of lightning.\" And in Vol. CHI. of the same Proceedings,\nMr. W. Pole, F.R.S., in describing how Mr. Bidder could determine\nmentally the logarithm of any number to 7 or 8 places, says (p. 252) :\n\" He had an almost miraculous power of seeing, as it were, intuitively\nwhat factors would divide any large number, not a prime. Thus, if\nhe were given the number 17,861, he would instantly remark it was\nXil x 53. . , . He could not, he said, explain how he did this ;\nit seemed a natural instinct to him.\"\nMr. Bidder's case is well known ; but it may be of interest to\nquote some passages from an autobiographical statement kindly\nfurnished to me by Mr. Blyth, of Edinburgh, the well-known civil\nengineer, whose own gift, like that of the younger Mr. Bidder,\nthough not such as to entitle him to rank as a \" prodigy,\" yet marks\nhim out distinctly from ordinary mankind.\n\f352 Mr. F. W. U. Myers.\nP. 141. .\n12, Belgrave-crescent, Edinburgh.\nFebruary 28th, 1892.\nI shall now endeavour, in response to your request, to give some account\nof my late brother's and my own faculty of arithmetical calculation men\ntally, and it may be interesting if I allude to influences even before birth\nwhich I have always felt may have had something to do with my brother's\ngreat power.\nBenjamin Hall Blyth was born on July 6th, 1819. Our mother had a natural\narithmetical gift\u2014not to any very marked degree, but decidedly above the\naverage, and especially so among females. Some months before Benjamin's\nbirth the wonderful calculating boy, Bidder (then, I think, about 12 or 14\nyears of age), was exhibiting in Edinburgh, and mado a private exhibition in\nmy father's house. My mother was greatly astonished and interested, put\nvarious questions to Bidder, and some weeks later requested my father to\ninvite him to another seance, which was done. Her interest increased on\nthis second occasion, and the wonderful boy continued to occupy her mind\nfrequently.\nIt is, I believe, admitted by physiologists that anything greatly occupy\ning a mother's mind certainly may, and frequently does, influence the\ncharacter of her unborn child. At all events, my brother, whether from this\nor heredity, or both, very early manifested a marvellous power of mental\ncalculation. When almost exactly six years of age Benjamin was walking\nwith his father before breakfast, when he said, \"Papa, at what hour was I\nborn 1\" He was told four a.m.\nBen. : What o'clock is it at present ?\nAns, : Seven fifty a.m. [My father always took exercise before breakfast\nin summer.]\nThe child walked on a few hundred yards, then turned to his father and\nstated the number of seconds he had lived. My father noted down the\nfigures, made the calculation when he got home, and told Ben he was 172,80f>\nseconds wrong, to which he got a ready reply : \" Oh, papa, you have left out\ntwo days for the leap years\u20141820 and 1824, \" which was the case.\nThis latter fact of the extra day in leap year is not known to many\nchildren of six, and if anyone will try to teach an ordinary child of these\nyears the multiplication table up to 12 x 12 he will be better able to realise\nhow extraordinary was this calculation for such an infant.\nI am conscious of an intuitive recognition of the relation of figures. For\ninstance, in reading statements of figures in newspapers, which are very\noften egregiously wrong, it seems to come to me intuitively that something is\nwrong, and when that occurs I am usually right.\nI have always felt that there were times when my power was much weaker\nthan others, not only when tired, but, like a musician, when not in the mood,\nI have not the same confidence now at 66 years of age as when younger.\nThat is to say, I like to check a calculation before stating it, though I can\ndo nearly as difficult ones as at any time of my life, though not so rapidly.\nAs to there being any degree of connection between this arithmetical\npower and ambidexterity, there is none, I think, in my case. I do not\npossess the latter gift consciously, though I may perhaps be able to use the\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 353\nleft hand better than the average of people, but I should not for a moment\nclaim to be ambidextrous. My daughter, in saying that I was, may have\nconfused me with my eldest son, who certainly is, but I attribute that to his\nbeing born left-handed and compelled as a child to use his right, as, for\ninstance, in use of knife or spoon, playing cricket, golf with right-hand clubs,\n&c. ; he can bowl or bat with either hand, paint with both hands ; will draw\nthe fore legs of an animal with one hand, the hind legs with another, just as\nthe bends or curves suit one hand more readily. He is fond of mechanical\nwork, and can use either hand in turning articles on a lathe. Left-handed'\nness runs in our family on both sides, and so I say I may have some little\nambidexterity without knowing it.\nEdward L. I. Blyth.\nMr. Blyth's interesting record contains other illustrations of\nseveral points above mentioned ;\u2014the early and instinctive appearance\nof the faculty ; its gradual subjection to supraliminal guidance ; yet\nthe persistence of occasional \" subliminal uprushes,\" which give the\nproblem's answer without its intermediate steps.\nPassing on to the two other men of high ability known to have\npossessed this gift, Professor Safford and Archbishop Whately, we are\nstruck with the evanescence of the power after early youth,\u2014or even\nbefore the end of childhood. I quote from Dr. Scripture Archbishop\nWhately's account of his own powers.\n\" There was certainly something peculiar in my calculating faculty. It\nbegan to show itself at between five and six, and lasted about three years.\n. . \u2022. I soon got to do the most difficult sums, always in my head, for I\nknew nothing of figures beyond numeration. I did these sums much quicker\nthan anyone could upon paper, and I never remember committing the\nsmallest error. When I went to school, at which time the passion wore off, I\niivrs a perfect dunce at ciphering, and have continued so ever since.\"\nStill more remarkable, perhaps, was Professor Safford's loss of power.\nProfessor Safford's whole bent was mathematical ; his boyish gift of\ncalculation raised him into notice ; and he is now a Professor of\nAstronomy. He. had therefore every motive and every opportunity to\nretain the gift, if thought and practice could have retained it. But\nwhereas at ten years old he worked correctly in his head, in one minute\na multiplication sum whose answer consisted of 36 figures, he is now, I\nbelieve, neither more nor less capable of such calculation than his\nneighbours.\nSimilar was the fate of a personage who never rises above initials,\nand of whose general capacity we know nothing.\n\" Mr. Van R., of Utica,\" says Dr. Scripture on the authority of\nGall, \"at the age of six years distinguished himself by a singular\nfaculty for calculating in his head. At eight he entirely lost this\nfaculty, and after that time he could calculate neither better nor faster\nthan any other person. He did not retain the slightest idea of the\nmanner in which he performed his calculations in childhood.\"\n\fMr. F. W. H. Myers.\nTurning now to the stupid or uneducated prodigies, Dase alone\nseems to have retained his power through life. Colburn and Mondeux,\nand apparently Prolongeau and Mangiamele, lost their gift after child\nhood.\nA few hints as to processes have been gleaned from this group ;\u2014the\nmost interesting point being that Colburn was for some years unable,\nbut afterwards to some extent able, to explain his own processes. \" His\nfriends tried to elicit a disclosure of the methods by which he performed\nhis calculations, but for nearly three years he was unable to satisfy\ntheir inquiries. He positively declared that he did not know how the\nanswers came into his mind.\" i Later on he did give an account of his\nartifices, which, however, showed no great ingenuity.\nBut on the whole the ignorant prodigies seldom appear to have\nbeen conscious of any continuous logical process, while in some cases\nthe separation of the supraliminal and subliminal trains of thought\nmust have been very complete. \" Buxton would talk freely whilst\ndoing his questions, that being no molestation or hindrance to him.\"'2\nFixity and clearness of inward visualisation seems to have been the\nleading necessity in all these achievements ; and it apparently mattered\nlittle whether the mental blackboard (so to say) on which the steps\nof the calculation were recorded were or were not visible to the mind's\neye of the supraliminal self.\nI have been speaking only of visualisation ; but it would be interest\ning if we could discover how much actual mathematical insight or in\nventiveness can be subconsciously exercised. Here, however, our\nmaterials are very imperfect. From Gauss and Ampere we have, so far\nas I know, no record. At the other end of the scale, we know that\nDase (perhaps the most successful of all these prodigies) was singularly\ndevoid of mathematical grasp. \" On one occasion Petersen tried in\nvain for six weeks to get the first elements of mathematics into his\nhead.\" \"He could not be made to have the least idea of a proposition\nin Euclid. Of any language but his own he could never master a\nword.\" Yet Dase received a grant from the Academy of Sciences at\nHamburg, on the recommendation of Gauss, for mathematical work :\nand actually in twelve years made tables of factors and prime numbers\nfor the seventh and nearly the whole of the eighth million,\u2014a task\nwhich probably few men could have accomplished, without mechanical\naid, in an ordinary lifetime. He may thus be ranked as the only man\nwho has ever done valuable service to mathematics without being able\nto cross the Ass's Bridge.\nOn the other hand, in the case of Mangiamele, there may have been\ni Scripture, op. eit., p. 50.\n5 Scripture, op. cit., p. 54.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 355\nreal ingenuity subliminally at work. Our account of this prodigy is\nauthentic, but tantalising from its brevity.\n\" In the year 1837 Vito Mangiamele, who gave his age as 10 years and\n4 months, presented himself before Arago in Paris. He was the son of a\nshepherd of Sicily, who was not able to give his son any instruction. By\nchance it was discovered that by methods peculiar to himself he resolved\nproblems that seemed at the first view to require extended mathematical\nknowledge. In the presence of the Academy Arago proposed the following\nquestions : ' What is the cubic root of 3,796,416 1 ' In the space of about\nhalf a minute the child responded 166, which is correct. ' What satisfies the\ncondition that its cube plus five times its square is equal to 42 times itself\nincreased by 40 ? ' Everybody understands that this is a demand for the root\nof the equation x:i +5 x1\u201442 x\u201440=0. In less than a minute Vito responded\nthat 5 satisfied the condition ; which is correct. The third question related\nto the solution of the equation x5\u20144 x\u201416779=0. This time the child\nremained four to five minutes without answering : finally he demanded with\nsome hesitation if 3 would not be the solution desired. The secretary having\ninformed him that he was wrong, Vito, a few moments afterwards, gave the\nnumber 7 as the true solution. Having finally been requested to extract the\n10th root of 282,475,249 Vito found in a short time that the root is 7.\n\"At a later date a committee, composed of Arago, Cauchy and others,\ncomplains that ' the masters of Mangiamele have always kept secret the\nmethods of calculation which he made use of.' \"1\nThere is another point on which something might have been learnt\nfrom the study of so marked a group of automatists\u2014utilisers of sub\nliminal capacity\u2014as these \" prodigies \" form. Their bodily charac\nteristics might have been examined with a view to tracing such physical\nconcomitants as may go with this facility of communication between\npsychical strata. We have, however, few data available for this pur\npose. Colburn inherited supernumerary digits, and Mondeux is\nreported to have been hysterical. On the other hand the \" prodigies \"\nof whose lives after childhood anything is known seem to have been\nfree from nervous taint. No one, for instance, could well be more\nremote from hysteria than the elder Bidder ;\u2014or than Mr. Bidder,\n.Q.C., or Mr. Blyth, of Edinburgh, the best living English representa\ntives of what we may call the calculating diathesis.\nIt is plain, then, that no support is given by what we know of this\ngroup to the theory which regards subliminal mentation as necessarily\na sign of some morbid dissociation of psychical elements. Is there, on\nthe other hand, anything to confirm the suggestion which I have else\nwhere made that,\u2014inasmuch as the addition of subliminal to supra\nliminal mentation may often be a completion and integration rather\nthan a fractionation or disintegration of the total individuality,\u2014we are\nlikely sometimes to find traces of a more than common activity of the\n} Scripture, op. cit., p. 17.\n\f356 Mr.F. W. H Myers.\nright or less used cerebral hemisphere? Finding no mention of ambidex\nterity in the meagre notices which have come down to us of the\ngreater \"prodigies,\" I begged Mr. Blyth and Mr. Bidder, Q.C., to tell\nme whether their left hands possessed more than usual power. Mr.\nBlyth's reply has been already quoted. I now quote Mr. Bidder's.\n\" Ravensbury Park, September 11th, 1891.\n\"As to ambidexterity. Of course I am ignorant of the train of thought\nthat led you to ask the question ; but oddly enough I am a very good\nexample of it. I am not aware that my father was ambidextrous ; nor are\nany of my children, so far as I know. For myself, in all sports,\u2014bowling,\nthrowing, fishing, tennis, racquets, &c.,--l almost invariably use the left\nhand. I cannot throw to any purpose with the right. In cricket, however, I\nbat with the right hand. In shaving, I shave one half of the face with the\nleft hand and the other with the right, in each case taking the part which\nshaves forwards, so as to have no backward shaving. In writing I write\nwith the right hand, being so taught ; but some years ago I discovered that if\nI let my left hand move unconstrainedly and without conscious thought as to\nhow it should form the letters, I could write with equal fluency, though not\nso well formed letters. But the direction of the writing is reversed ; so that\nit is requisite either to look through the paper or view it in a looking-glass\nto read the writing. My left hand and nerve system seems to have learnt\nby sympathy what the right had acquired by education and practice.\n'' Further, I found that taking two pencils one in each hand I could write\nsimultaneously with both hands,\u2014the two writings proceeding in opposite\ndirections. I have occasionally found since that other people could to some\nextent do the same. I repeatedly tried very hard to write one word with\none hand and another with the other ;\u2014but it won't do ; the result is always\na nondescript production of parts of both words,\u2014something like the non\nsense words in Alice in Wonderland. I enclose a specimen which will show\nthe simultaneous writing.\"\nIt thus appears that in the only two cases in which I have been\nable to make inquiry there is somewhat more dextro-cerebral capacity\nthan in the mass of mankind.\nIf I have dwelt at some length on these arithmetical prodigies, it is\nnot, of course, because I regard this gift of subliminal computation as\na high form of genius, but because the definiteness of the achievements,\npresents some vague and elusive problems in a comparatively manageable\nform. Thus it is easier in the case of a Mangiamele than in the case\nof a Dante to ask oneself with exactness which is the least improbable\nof the conceivable answers,\u2014all of them largely conjectural,\u2014to the\nquestion, \" Where did the child get his genius?\"\u2014a question which the\nevolutionist, though he cannot solve it, must not ignore.\nIt appears to me that the answers which have been implicitly or\nexplicitly given to such a question are reducible under four main heads.\nI shall cite these in the order in which they push the required answer\nfurther and further back. But the reader must remember that there\n\fThe Sublimitml Consciousness.\nis absolutely no difference in point of the myitery involved between\none reply and another. All have to deal with the same ultimately\ninexplicable facts, and the most Lamarckian of answers is in reality as\nmystical as the most Platonic.\n(1) First, then, I place what I have called the Lamarckian reply.\nThe eminent capacity of the individual under discussion was inherited\nfrom the acquired capacities of self-improving ancestors. To this we\nmust here answer that even assuming acquired characteristics to be\ninheritable, there were as a rule no such acquired capacities for our\nprodigies to inherit. Mangiamele the father, the rough Sicilian,\npeasant, who did not teach his son his letters ;\u2014Mondeux the father,\nthe woodcutter of Tours, who did not teach his son the numerals ;\u2014\nthese were not men who had developed their mathematical gifts as the\nLamarckian giraffe developed the bones of his neck. The only case\nwhere heredity could be pleaded is that of the younger (not of the\nelder) Bidder ;\u2014unless we count under this head the pre-natal sugges\ntion which Mr. Blyth believes to have been efficacious in his own and\nhis brother's case.\n(2) Next comes the reply which I suppose would now be commonly\ngiven, and which, to avoid the ambiguities of the word Darwinian, I will\ncall the protoplasmic solution. Mangiamele's gift, in this view, was a\nsport or bye-product occurring in the course of evolution ;\u2014a new\nquality derived from old qualities not obviously resembling it. It was\none of those favourable spontaneous variations of which natural selection\nhas often been able to take advantage ;\u2014and whose occasional unpre\ndictable occurrence has raised our race to its present level. Now the\ncause of such sports, I need not say, Darwin expressly leaves unex\nplained. All that he says is that to sport in this way is characteristic\nof living matter. Sudden differentiation in unpredictable directions\nmust, in short, be a latent capacity of protoplasm ; and the explana\ntion of Mangiamele's gift is virtually referred to the nature of the stock\nof protoplasm with which his earliest ancestors started operations.\nThis answer has the logical advantage over the Lamarckian answer,\n(which, of course, at bottom is protoplasmic also,) that, being hardly\nmore than a mere restatement of the facts, it cannot help being true so\nfar as it goes. But it is not, and was not propounded by Darwin as\nbeing, an explanation of the ultimate source of faculty, but only of\ncertain incidents in its terrene development.\n(3) In direct contrast to these terrene explanations comes the pre-\nterrene explanation of Plato. A man learns geometrical truths easily,\nPlato said, because in reality he is only remembering them. He is\nremembering them beause he learnt them originally in the ideal world,\nbefore his incarnation \" in this body, which is our tomb.\" One wishes\nthat Plato had had the facts now before us to work up into a dialogue,\n\f358 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\u2014 Dase, or Inspiration.\" If he thought his hypothesis of reminiscence\nnecessary in order to explain the mental effort of an intelligent adult\nmastering what were then the startling novelties contained in the first\nbooks of Euclid,\u2014what would he have said of Pascal, who wais \u00bbW\n&6vp( fieyd\\a epya,\u2014-sported with cosmic laws in childish play ;\u2014of Gauss\nflinging down his slate with the answer alone written upon it,\u2014Da\nliegt es !\u2014the moment that the master had dictated the question\nwhich was to occupy the class for an hour ;\u2014or above all, as I say, of\nthe crass and stolid Dase,\u2014-as it were an idiot supported from the\nPrytaneum, to declare secrets which the gods had hid from men ?\n(4) Lastly, the view which I am here suggesting is in some sort a\nrenewal of the old Platonic \" reminiscence,\" in the light of that fuller\nknowledge which is common property to-day. I hold, of course, that\nin the protoplasm or primary basis of all organic life there must have\nbeen an inherent adaptability to the manifestation of all faculties\nwhich organic life has in fact manifested. I hold, of course, that sports\nor variations occur, which are at present unpredictable, and which\nreveal in occasional offspring faculties which their parents showed no\nsigns of possessing. But I differ from those who hold that the faculty\nitself thus manifested is now for the first time initiated in that stock\nby some chance combination of hereditary elements. I hold that it is\nnot initiated, but only revealed ; that the \" sport \" has not called a\nnew faculty into being, but has merely raised an existing faculty above\nthe threshold of supraliminal consciousness.\nThis view, if pushed back far enough, is no doubt inconsistent with\nthe way in which evolution is generally conceived. For it denies that\nall human faculties need have been evoked by terrene experience. It\nassumes a subliminal self, with unknown faculties, originated in some\nunknown way, and not merely by contact with the needs which the\nterrene organism has had to meet. It thus seems at first sight to be\nintroducing a new mystery, and to be introducing it in a gratuitous\nway.\nTo this I reply in the first place that so far as the origin of man's\nknown powers is concerned, no fresh mystery is in fact introduced. All\nhuman powers, to put the thing broadly, have somehow or other to be\ngot into protoplasm and got out again. You have to explain first how\nthey became implicit in the earliest and lowest living thing, and then\nhow they have become thus far explicit in the latest and highest. All\nthe faculties of that highest being, I repeat, existed virtually in the\nlowest, and in so far as the admitted faculties are concerned the\ndifference between my view and the ordinary view may be said to be\nlittle more than a difference as to the sense which that word virtually\nis here to assume.\nThe real difference between the two views appears when the facul\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 359\nties which I have called unknown come to be considered. If they are\nheld to be real, my view is certainly the better able to embrace them.\nI hold that telepathy and clairvoyance do in fact exist ;\u2014telepathy, a\ncommunication between incarnate mind and incarnate mind, and per\nhaps between incarnate minds and minds unembodied ;\u2014clairvoyance, a\nknowledge of things terrene which overpasses the limits of ordinary\nperception,\u2014and which perhaps also achieves an insight into some other\nthan terrene world. And these faculties, I say, cannot have been\nacquired by natural selection, for the preservation of the race, during\nthe process of terrene evolution. In some sense they pre-existed ; they\nwere (as we may phrase it) the products of pre-terrene evolution. And\nif they were so, man's other powers may well have been so also. Per\nception pre-existed ; and the specialised forms of terrene perception\nwere not real novelties in the universe, but imperfect adaptations of\nprotoplasm to the manifestation of the indwelling general perceptive\npower. The mathematical faculty, for instance (I say with Plato), pre\nexisted. When Dase solved all those sums in his head, his power of\nsolving them was not a fresh development in his ancestral stock, but\ndepended on the accidental adaptation of his organism to the manifes\ntation of the indwelling computative power. I do not indeed venture\nto follow Plato in his ontogenetic argument,\u2014his claim that the\nindividual computator has had already an individual training in com\nputation. I do not say that Dase himself learnt or divined the multi\nplication-table in some ideal world. I only say that Dase and all the\nrest of us are the spawn or output of some unseen world in which the\nmultiplication-table is, so to speak, in the air. Dase trailed it after\nhim. as the poet says of the clouds of glory, when he \"descended into\ngeneration \" in a humble position at Hamburg.\nIn him and in his ancestors were many faculties which were called\nout by the struggle for existence, and became supraliminal. But there\nwere many faculties also which were not thus called out, and which\nconsequently remained subliminal. To these faculties, as a rule, his\nsupraliminal self could get no access. But by some chance of evolution,\n\u2014some sport,\u2014a vent-hole was opened at this one point between the\ndifferent strata of his being, and a subliminal uprush carried his com-\nputative faculty into the open day.\nIt is to work done by the aid of any such uprush that the word\n\" genius \" may be most fitly applied. \"A work of genius,\" indeed, in com\nmon parlance, means a work which satisfies two quite distinct require\nments. It must involve something original, spontaneous, unteachable,\nunexpected ; and it must also in some way win for itself the admiration\nof mankind. Now, psychologically speaking, the first of these require\nments corresponds to a real class, the second to a purely accidental\none. What the poet feels while he writes his poem is the psychological\n\f360 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfact in his history ; what his friends feel while they read it may be a,\npsychological fact in their history, but does not alter the poet's creative\neffort, which was what it was, whether anyone but himself ever reads his\npoem or no.\nAnd popular phraseology justifies our insistence upon this subjective\nside of genius. Thus it is common to say that \" Hartley Coleridge \"\n(for example) \" was a genius, although he never produced anything\nworth speaking of.\" Men recognise, that is to say, from descriptions\nof Hartley Coleridge, and from the fragments which he has left, that\nideas came to him with what I have termed a sense of subliminal up-\nrush,\u2014with an authentic, although not to us an instructive, inspiration.\nThe especial advantage of the study of arithmetical prodigies is that\nin their case the subjective impression coincides closely with the objec\ntive result. The subliminal computator feels that the sum is right, and\nit is right. Forms of real or supposed genius which are more interest\ning are apt to be less undeniable.\nIn conclusion we must dwell for a moment upon another and\nhigher kind of internal visualisation. I have spoken of the arithmetical\nprodigy as possessing a kind of internal blackboard, on which he\ninscribes with ease and permanence his imaginary memoranda. But\nblackboards are not the only surfaces on which inscriptions can be\nmade. There are other men,\u2014prodigies of a different order,\u2014whose\ninternal tabula is not of blackened wood, but of canvas or of marble ;\n\u2014whose inscriptions are not rows of arabic numerals but living lines of\ncolour, or curves of breathing stone. Even the most realistic art is\nsomething more than transcript and calculation ; and for art's higher\nimaginative achievements there must needs be moments of inward\nidealisation when visible beauty seems but the token and symbol of\nbeauty unrevealed ;\u2014when Praxiteles must \" draw from his own heart\nthe archetype of the Eros that he made \" ;\u2014when Tintoret must feel\nwith Heraclitus that \" whatsoever we see waking is but deadness, and\nwhatsoever sleeping, is but dream.\"\nIt would be easy to quote many a passage in which these gifted\nyisualisers have described, more impressively than Colburn or Bidder,\nthe unexpected, the incalculable flashing of the perfect conception\nupon the eye within. But such self-revelations, however genuinely\nexpressed, might only produce upon the reader a feeling of grotes-\nqueness or confusion. For, as I have said, the subjective sensation of\ntriumphant genius is by no means always coincident with the corre\nsponding objective effect. In the diaries of the luckless Haydon we\nshould find ample utterance of the sense of complete achievement. In\nthe sonnets of Raphael or of Michael Angelo we should find all moods\nof haunting search, of deep desire ;\u2014descending to that profoundest\nnote which declares that sovereign sweetness is in itself incompatible\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 361\n\u2022with the life of earth ;\u2014che soverchia dolcezza a morte mena. It\nwould, I repeat once more, be useless for the psychologist to attempt\nto classify works of genius on the basis of their objective merit. In\nhis eyes the word genius will have the truest meaning when it depends\nwholly on the mind's mode of interior working,\u2014when it is made to\ninclude phenomena as disparate as Mr. Higton's vision of the weight\nof the hides, and Lady Eardley's warning voice, and Zerah Colburn's\nanswers to multiplication-sums, along with Sappho's odes, and\nBeethoven's sonatas, and the Faun of Praxiteles ;\u2014aye, and even,\n\u2014what seems still stranger,\u2014along with the poorest art which has\ncarried with it a genuine sense of inspiration,\u2014along with Smith's\nverses to Miss Jones, and Miss Jones' water-colour sketch of her\nguardian angel. Only let those of us who may have shared this glow\nremember that our uprush of subliminal faculty may be of no deeper\ninterest to mankind than was Mr. Higton's equally inspired vision of a\nclock-face, which revealed to him, while his watch was in his pocket,\nthat it was 11.25 a.m. The only reward of inspiration which we are\nentitled to look for is the sense of inspiration itself.\nDas Lied, das aus der Kehle dringt,\n1st Lohn, der reichlich lohnet.\nAnd if these cautions are needed in the realm of Art, where there\nare at least some accepted canons to which our productions must\nconform, how much more necessary will they be in those wider, more\nemotional fields in which inspiration\u2014subliminal or extraneous\u2014is so\noften claimed,\u2014in the realms of Love and Faith ! But the questions of\nthe subliminal guidance of emotion, of the origins of prophetic utterance,\nalthough not alien to my general subject, lie outside of my present\nintention. I am dealing here with the subliminal self as it operates\nwithin the limits of our familiar and definite capacity, and adds to that\ncapacity, which seemed strictly conditioned by the very structure of\nour organism, a new vividness or energy of its own. I have urged\nthat the spectrum of our ordinary consciousness,\u2014even without con\nsidering its possible prolongations beyond either limit,\u2014may undergo\na general accession of luminosity from the uprush from some central\nglow. Bright lines may thus be brightened ; and dark absorption-bands\nmay disappear. And there is ground for serious hope in the thought\nthat this intensification of radiance may be the destiny of the faintest\nas of the most brilliant luminary. The difference between human spirit\nand spirit, as between blazing sun and sun, is a difference of magnitude\nrather than of constitution. One star may differ from another star in\nglory ; but all are fashioned of the same primal elements, and kindled\nwith the same cosmic fire.\n2 B\n\f362 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nChapter IV.\nHypermne8ic Dreams.\nIn the chapter just concluded we have been reviewing certain indi\ncations of subliminal operation which are discernible in ordinary\nwaking life, and within the range of man's familiar and admitted\npowers. It has been shown that sensory perceptions of more than\nnormal acuteness, sensory memories of more than normal distinctness\nand tenacity, are sometimes initiated or preserved beneath the threshold\nand outside the control of the waking supraliminal Self. And I have\nurged that we thus obtain glimpses of an activity which I believe to\nbe constantly going on within us;\u2014of a source of light (to return to a\nprevious metaphor) which is able to add illumination to the bright lines\nof our familiar spectrum, as well as to prolong that spectrum beyond\nboth its physiological and its psychological limits.\nThe main interest of our inquiry will probably be found in excur\nsions into regions of faculty as yet unmapped and unregistered. But\nbefore passing on to telepathy and clairvoyance we must complete the\ntask of the last chapter by reviewing those subliminal indications of\nquickened sensory perception, intensified memory, which are discerned\nduring the dominance of that second phase of personality which we are\nwont to class as equally normal with our waking life.\nThe definition of deep is a task which the physiologist prudently\ndeclines to attempt. The causes which lead to its onset;\u2014the condi\ntion of the brain and other organs during its persistence;\u2014the precise\nway in which it produces its restorative or other effects ;\u2014all these are\nstill matters of hypothesis, not of knowledge. And the old difficulties\nof explanation have been increased,\u2014to an extent which has not yet\nbeen grasped by the writers of ordinary text-books,\u2014by all these recent\nexperiments in the induction of hypnotic slumber. \" Accumulation of\nwaste products,\" \"de-oxygenation,\" \"periodicity\" ;\u2014causes such as these,\nwhatever their importance in inducing ordinary nocturnal sleep, can\nhardly be invoked to explain a long deep slumber produced by mere\nsuggestion in an unfatigued subject. Nor can any facile simplification,\non one side or on the other, extricate us from this dilemma. If, with the\nSalpetriere school, we pronounce the hypnotic trance a morbid pheno\nmenon, quite different from true sleep, we are met by a series of\nsleep-states too continuous for any logical break ;\u2014till at last we should\nhave to call the baby's slumber in the cradle a morbid thing, because\nits mother has used monotonous stimulation in the form of rocking and\npats. If on the other hand, with the school of Nancy, we assert that\nhypnotic trance is virtually identical with ordinary sleep, the difference\nbeing only in degrees of \" suggestibility,\"\u2014then we have but imported\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 363\ninto our conception of ordinary sleep that unsolved enigma of \" sugges\ntion \" of which so much has already been here said.\nFrom the point of view taken in these papers such attempts at\nsimplification as either of these must necessarily be crude and inadequate.\nWe are regarding the human individuality as a practically infinite\nreservoir of personal states ;\u2014as a kaleidoscope which may be shaken\ninto a thousand patterns, yet so that no pattern can employ all the\npieces contained in the tube. We shall therefore regard sleep as a\nphase of personality neither more nor less natural, neither more nor less\nexplicable, than vigilance ;\u2014natural or explicable, indeed, only in the\nhistorical or evolutionary sense, as having played a part of manifest use\nfulness in the conservation of living races.\nAnd looking to the origins of animal life we shall recognise that\nthe permanent state of lower organisms, the primary state of higher\norganisms, is one much more analogous to sleep than to waking. So\nlong as food comes without seeking there is no need to watch or wake.\nAnd as sleep precedes vigilance so do dreams precede thought. Such\nconsciousness, that is to say, as may exist in organisms in which the\nalternation of waking and slumber is not yet definitely established\nis likely, in its confused dimness, in its imperfect response to external\nstimuli, to resemble our slumber-sense of cold or pressure far more\nclosely than it resembles the alert attention of our daylight hours.\nThen comes into play that agency\u2014call it what you will\u2014the\nevolutionary nisus\u2014the creative Power\u2014the \"Jupiter ipse \" implanting\nin each organism the capacity of developing new faculties under new\nstress,\u2014\nNec torpere gravi passus sua regna veterno.\nWhen food must be sought, we learn to seek it ; to seek it first by aid\nof one sense-organ after another, specialised from a diffused sensibility\naccording to our need ;\u2014and to seek it afterwards by aid of inward\nreflection,\u2014of those molecular cerebral changes which make the output\nof muscular movement in a Stephenson more effective in food-produc\ntion than the apparently greater output of the navvy working on his\nrailway's track.\nAs evolution advances, then, we in some sense become more and\nmore awake. Our secondary condition diverges further and further\nfrom our primary, by growing adaptation to the more complex needs\nof life. But nevertheless we retain the habit of reversion to our\nprimitive phase of personality ; occasional periods of the slumber in\nwhich our bodies were first framed are needful for their due main\ntenance and renewal. Why this should be so,\u2014whether it always\nmust be so,\u2014we cannot say. We have no clue to the forces which\nshake the kaleidoscope of our psychical being now into this pattern,\nnow into that.\n2 b 2\n\fMr. F. W. H. Myers.\nBut although our suggested mode of regarding sleep cannot itself\nclaim to be regarded as an explanation, it may be serviceable in guarding\nus against explanations of an incomplete or one-sided kind. Thus, for\ninstance, however important may be the function of sleep in facilitating-\nthe elimination of the products of nervous waste, we shall not think it\nprobable that the accumulation of such products in the system should\nbo the sole inducing cause of sleep. Consequently there will be nothing\nto surprise us in the discovery that sleep can be induced by hypnotic\nsuggestion at moments when no lactates, tfec, can have accumulated in\nthe system.\nAgain, important as the influence of periodicity may be in inducing\nsleep, we shall not be willing to assume that sleep is necessarily a\nperiodical function. It will in no way surprise us to find that sleep in\ncertain subjects can be almost indefinitely prolonged, if food\u2014and often\nif very little food\u2014is supplied to the sleeper, or placed within reach of\nhis automatic or subliminal impulse to grasp it. Attaques de sommeil\nare becoming familiar now ; but it should he remembered that they\nwere once as scornfully and even cruelly disbelieved as was the mesmeric\ntrance itself.i In our view, on the other hand, such prolonged slumbers\nwill form a not specially surprising reversion to the habit of pre-human\nancestors, aiid to our own earliest phase of physical and psychical being.\nAs regards the prolongation of the waking state, on the other hand,\nthe influence of this view of sleep will be mainly negative. I mean that we\nshall not consider it so impossible as it appears on ordinary physiological\ntheories of sleep that some kind of active state should be abnormally\nextended ;\u2014that some variety, whether evolutive or dissolutive, of\nvigilance should be developed which is less prone to frequent reversion\nto the primary slumber.\nWe shall not be surprised, then, to meet with states either of\necstacy or of disease in which ordinary sleep seems for the time to be\nsuperseded. With ecstacy we shall have to deal later on ;\u2014a striking\nexample of prolonged vigilance in mania may be quoted from the well-\nknown alienist, Sir J. Crichton Browne.2\n\" Nothing can well be more unexpected than the replaceability of\nsleep by maniacal excitement. Chronic maniacs are in a state of perpetual\nmental and bodily restlessness. They talk to themselves, they chatter\nthroughout the night, they dance, clap their hands, gesticulate, indulge\nin shouts of laughter, or tear their clothing to pieces. The length\nof time during which they can continue to discharge nervous energy\nuninterruptedly in this excessive and almost semi-convulsive manner\ni See Zoitt, Vol. XII., p. 381, tqq., where Elliotson's robust and manly oommon-\n\u00abenso once more showed its superiority over the professional prejudice of his time.\n5 West Riding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports, Vol. V., p. 2S8.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciomness. 365\nis truly astonishing. I have had under my care a chronic maniac\nwho worked energetically as a navvy all day, and who sat up in bed\ntalking and shouting all night, for six months together. During\nthese six months he was never known to sleep. By day he manifested\nnot the slightest drowsiness, and by night he was never caught\nnodding. The night attendants visited him hourly, and at every\nvisit he was in the same position, propped up in his bed, and at\nthe same occupation, pouring out vociferously a torrent of incoherence.\nNot less remarkable than the length of time during which uninter-\nmitting excitement can be kept up in chronic mania is the smallness of\nthe effect which the long-sustained and severe exertion and the pro\ntracted sleeplessness exert upon the bodily health. Exhaustion is rare\nin chronic mania. The man to whom I have alluded had not lost\nweight after his six months' noisy vigil.\"\nThe condition here described is assuredly more remote than either\nprolonged fasting, prolonged natural sleep, or prolonged hypnotic trance,\nfrom the ordinary physiological current of man's existence. It is one\nof the obscure hints which reach the physician from many quarters\nthat we are dealing with a machine whose original motive power\nis in fact considerably greater than its ordinary operation would lead us\nto suppose.\nIn our present discussion, however, which is concerned with the\nnature of sleep only on its psychological side, the main interest lies in\nthe analysis of such manifestations of thought or sensation as the sleeping\nstate affords. And to begin with, our conception of sleep as no mere\nabeyance of waking activities, but rather as a phase of personality with\ncharacteristics definitely its own, will lead us to set aside as fallacies\nvarious current notions as to the nature of dreams. Thus it is often\nsupposed that the dreams which are in themselves the most vivid will\nalso be the best remembered ;\u2014and that such dreams will occur in states\nof imperfect sleep. To this we shall reply that, on the analogy of other\nseverances of personality, we shall expect that the impressions carried\nfrom one phase into another are likely to be the confused impressions\nof transitional states ; and that the deeper and more characteristic\nthe experience of any subliminal state may be, the more unlikely is it\nto pass into the supraliminal chain of memory,\nSomewhat similarly we shall refuse to take for granted, as is com\nmonly done, that dreams cannot possibly be anything more than echoes\n\u2022or fragments of waking experience, fantastically combined. Such an\nassumption implies what we altogether deny ;\u2014that the supraliminal\npersonality is identical with the true Self,\u2014that the supraliminal chain\nof memory is the only coherent or continuous chain. Our minds, on\nthe other hand, will be absolutely open as regards the possible content\nof dreams ; and we shall desire that dreams should be subjected to\n\f366 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nan analysis far more searching than they have as yet received from\nany quarter.\nOne great general lesson the world may be said to have learnt\nfrom dreams. Dreams, says Mr. Herbert Spencer, \" are the experi\nence out of which the conception of a mental self eventually grows.\"\nOnly so soon, that is to say, as the savage realises that he has\nnot been out hunting in bodily form during sleep,\u2014\" as this supposed\nduplicate, once thought of as like the original in all things, becomes\ngradually modified by the dropping of physical characters irreconcilable\nwith the facts, does the hypothesis of a mental self, as we understand\nit, become established.\" i\nExtending this remark in the direction which later knowledge\nsuggests, we may say that just as some slight dissociation of elements\nhabitually associated in supraliminal activity was thus necessary in\norder to enable the savage to conceive even of a supraliminal Self,\u2014\nso for us also the more complex dissociations involved in somnambulism^\nhypnotic trance, &c., are necessary in order to enable us to conceive of\nthat completer self of which the supraliminal self is only a partial\nmanifestation.\nLooked at in this wide and general manner, dreams have afforded\nto minds at every stage of culture some kind of permanent suggestion\nof possibilities lying outside the familiar course of things. But when\nwe come to anything like detailed analysis, we find the field almost\nunworked. The shallower dreams, if I may so term them,\u2014those\nwhich occur in disturbed sleep, or at the moment of waking,\u2014have\nreceived some ingenious explanations ; but little attention has been paid\nto the deeper dreams,\u2014those which occur, (as the dreamer believes,) in\nprofound sleep, and sometimes leave upon waking hours an impression\nof reality which the confused fancies of fever, or the nightmares of\nindigestion, cannot rival.\nAnd there is of course this difficulty,\u2014that the quality of any given\ndream can be estimated only by the dreamer ; while of all waking;\nmemories the memory of dreams is (and in our view inevitably) the\nmost uncertain and evanescent. This difficulty, however, which at first\nseems as though it must infect all conclusions with the observer's own\nsubjectivity, can be overcome by a simple expedient. Let a man\nregister all those dreams whose quality impresses him ; and let him\nthen observe whether such dreams, when they admit of confirmation,\nare actually confirmed by fact. They are capable of being thus con\nfirmed whenever the dream incidents are such as subsequently to show\ncoincidence\u2014or want of coincidence\u2014with some event, past, present, or\nfuture, which was unknown to the dreamer's waking self. All that is\ni PrincipUs ofSociology, Vol. I., p. 157.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 367\nneeded is that a man who attaches importance to any of his dreams\nshould make immediate record of any dream which, on subjective\ngrounds, he thinks likely to belong to a clairvoyant or coincidental class.\nIf all the dreams which he intends to count are thus recorded before\ntheir fulfilment or non-fulfilment is known,\u2014and if he scrupulously\nabstains from counting any dream not thus recorded, however strikingly\nit may be fulfilled,\u2014we shall be able to calculate, with no fear of\nexaggeration, the proportion of coincidences between dream and fact.\nFor any mistakes which he may make in his subjective estimate of his\ndreams will, on the supposition that all the coincidences are due to\nchance, be exactly as likely to tell against him as for him,\u2014while, on\nthe supposition that a certain class of his dreams are really veridical,\nhis mistakes in distinguishing beforehand the true members of this\nclass will tell wholly against him. And if his impressive dreams,\nwhenever they involve a possible coincidence with provable fact,\ndo so coincide, he will have some reason for attaching importance\nto other dreams subjectively similar, but less capable of definite\ntesting.\nThere is another way of gauging a dream's intensity,\u2014of picking\nout a small and significant class. Dreams which have led to action are\nextremely rare,\u2014rarer, probably, even than waking hallucinations.\nMost of the dreams referred to in this chapter belong to that group.\nThe dreamer has actually done something in waking hours as a direct\nresult of his nocturnal experience.\nIn practice it will be found that although many men, and often,\ndream confused dreams, few men, and rarely, dream dreams to which\nthey can attach importance even on purely subjective grounds. It\nwould be an easier thing than at first appears to keep a record of all\nsuch dreams as were not easily explicable by fragmentary memories or\ncorporeal conditions ; and such a record would, even apart from the\ncoincidental class of dreams, yield much of value to the psychologist.1\nIf, at least, our waking life,\u2014our supraliminal personality,\u2014is only\none of many possible patterns into which the elements of our fuller\nindividuality may arrange themselves ;\u2014those elements not being all of\nthem employed in any one of such patterns ;\u2014then we may fairly\nexpect that even the simplest and most primitive pattern may reveal\nelements absent from other patterns, or at least may teach us, by its\nnew arrangements, something fresh as to the elements already known.\nAnd here we may, I hope, find it useful to have already discussed\nsome of the subliminal phenomena revealed by hypnotism, before\ni Dr. Nelson, of Johns Hopkins University, with a statistical object of a different\nkind, has recorded over 1,000 dreams of his own per annum for some years. (American\nJournal of Psychology, Vol. I., Part 3, p. 374.)\n\f368 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\napproaching the subject of spontaneous sleep. For spontaneous sleep\n\u2014whether or not it differs from hypnotic sleep (as Li\u00e9beault maintains)\nonly in being the result of self-suggestion instead of suggestion from\nwithout,\u2014is at least in some sense a halfway house between hypnotic\ntrance and waking life ; and we may well begin our inquiry into the\nsensory and mental phenomena of common sleep by considering what\nphenomena could really be classed as intermediate between those of\nvigilance and those of induced somnambulism.\nI am of course here speaking of positive, not of merely negative\ncharacteristics ;\u2014not of the abstraction from waking interests, the\nsubsidence of muscular energy, which are common to most forms of\nsleep and trance, but of the additions to faculty which those states\nreveal ; whether those additions take the form of an increased command\nover the present, the future, or the past.\n1. To take first an increase of power in the present,\u2014of grasp over\nthe world without or over the sensory centres within. We have\nobserved that in the hypnotic trance there is often a heightening of\nsensory faculty, in its two main forms of external and internal hypenes-\nthesia,\u2014a quickened capacity, say, for reading small print or discerning\nminute specks on a card,\u2014and also a quickened \" mind's eye \" crea\ntivity,\u2014a power of projecting hallucinatory images more vivid than any\nwhich waking effort could induce. We shall expect, then, that in\ndream or somnolence there will Iie some trace of added power of this\nkind ;\u2014something seen as waking eyes cannot see, or imagined as\nwaking attention cannot imagine.\n2. And to take next another power which, exercised of course in the\npresent, becomes manifest by its influence upon the future, we know\nthat ideas or suggestions carried over from the hypnotic into the\nnormal state often exert a much stronger and more permanent influence\nthan similar statements or recommendations would exert if originally\nmade to the waking subject. We shall therefore think it probable that\nsome dreams may in this respect resemble hypnotic suggestions, and\nmay influence waking life in a way which the waking personality\ncannot justify or explain.\n3. Passing on now to memory, or control over the past, the\ncharacter of sleep,\u2014roughly intermediate between waking life and the\nhypnotic trance,\u2014will suggest that its memory will have links of almost\nequal strength with the memory of waking life and the memory of\nhypnotic states. Thus far, then, it will resemble the hypnotic memory\n\u2014which is apt to be the more comprehensive of the two ;\u2014although we\ncannot, of course, assume that it will be identical with that memory.\n4. And yet again ; it is not only over periods rendered ecmnesic\n\u2014cut out of waking memory\u2014by hypnotic trance that we may expect\ndream-memory to extend some kind of sway. Ecmnesic periods of\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 369\nother kinds occur ; gaps of memory, for instance, sometimes follow upon\nconcussion of the brain. It will be interesting to see whether the\nmemory of any of these periods is recoverable in sleep.\n5. But apart from hypnotic trance, from ecmnesic lacune, may there\nnot, we may well ask, be something else in dream - memory which\nwaking memory does not contain 1 In our discussion of \" The\nMechanism of Genius \" we saw that even during our ordinary waking\nlife there was something within us which observed more, felt more,\nremembered more than the supraliminal consciousness by itself could\never tell us. May not dream recall to us some of those deeply-hidden\nimpressions which form the material on which genius works ? Dream\noften recalls to us facts of our waking life which we have known and\nforgotten. May it not also recall to us facts which our supraliminal\nselves have never known 'I\n6. Lastly,\u2014and giving to our anticipations above-mentioned a more\nextended form,\u2014we shall expect that those supernormal powers which\nemerge with difficulty through the vigorous but superficial current of\nordinary waking life will show more frequently at the surface through\nthe stiller waters of sleep. Telepathy, clairvoyance, premonition ;\u2014\npowers like these, if they exist in us anywhere, must surely leave some\ntraces upon our dreams. I must, however, for the present postpone\ninquiry into these points ; since the verification of the five previous\nsuggestions as to what may be anticipated from sleep and dreams will\nafford more than enough material for this chapter.\n(1) First, then, as to the haightening of sensory faculty in sleep or\ndream. There seems at first sight something of paradox in expecting\nhyperesthesia from somnolence ;\u2014vivid sensation from a condition\nusually described as a progressive dulling or subsidence of one sense\nafter another. And, naturally, it will be in the generation of internal\nrather than in the perception of external imagery that we may expect\nto find the closed eye active,-\u2014.\nopavra \\apirpbv iv ctkotw vtopavr ucppiv.\nThere is in fact a phenomenon, by no means uncommon, and very\nconspicuous, which, like many other human phenomena whose interest\nis scientific rather than therapeutic, remained unnoticed until a very\nrecent date. Haillarger in France and Griesinger in Germany (both\nabout 1845) were among the first to call attention to the vivid images\nwhich rise before the internal vision of many persons, between sleep\nand waking. M. Alfred Maury, the well-known Greek scholar and\nantiquary, gave to these images a few years later the title of illusions\nhypnagogiqucs, and published a remarkable series of observations upon\nhimself. Mr. Galton has further treated of them in his Inquiry into\nHuman Faculty ; and Cases will be found in Phantasms of the Living,\nVol. I., pp. 390, 474, &c.\n\f370 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nThese visions may be hypnopompic as well as hypnagogic ;\u2014may\nappear, that is to say, at the moment when slumber is departing as well\nas at the moment when it is coming on ;\u2014and in either case they are\nclosely related to dreams ; the \" hypnagogic illusions \" or pictures\nbeing sometimes repeated in dream (as with Maury), and the hypno\npompic pictures consisting generally in the persistence of some dream\nimage into the first moments of waking. In either case they testify to\nan intensified power of inward visualisation at a very significant\nmoment ;\u2014a moment which is actually or virtually one of sleep, but\nwhich yet admits of definite comparison with adjacent momenta of\nwaking. We may call the condition one of cerebral or \" mind's eye \"\nhyperesthesia,\u2014an exalted sensibility of special brain-centres in\nresponse to those unknown internal stimuli which are always giving;\nrise to similar but fainter inward visions even in broadly-waking hours.\nFor those who are already good visualisers such phenomena as these,\nthough striking enough, present no quite unique experience. For bad\nvisualisers, on the other hand, the vividness of these hypnagogic pictures\nmay be absolutely a revelation. For myself I may say that were it not\nfor an occasional flash of this kind, between sleep and waking, I should\nbe unable to conceive what good visualisation really is. The dim,\nblurred, unstable images which are all that my waking will can summon\nup are every now and then replaced in a moment of somnolence by a\npicture\u2014say of a wet hedge in the sun\u2014which seems, to my hurried\nglance, to be absolutely as clear and brilliant as the object itself could\nbe. The difference is like that between an instantaneous photograph\n(and in natural colours !) and a dim dissolving view cast by a magic-\nlantern on the point of going out. Many men must have had this\nexperience ; and must have been struck with the unguessed reserve of\nfaculty which for a moment was thus revealed.\nEqually remarkable are the hypnopompic pictures, as I have\ntermed them ;\u2014those, namely, which accompany the departure of sleep.\nFor it often happens (as in the cases cited by Mr. Gurney) that a figure\nwhich has formed part of a dream continues to be seen as a hallucina\ntion for some moments after waking ;\u2014a strong testimony to the vivid\nness of dream-visualisation. As already observed, the generation of a\nhallucinatory figure (however useless an achievement) marks probably\nthe highest point which man's visualising faculty ever reaches ; and it\nis noteworthy that with many persons this point should be attained in\ndream alone. Sometimes, it may be, this prolongation of hallucination\nmay best be described as an after-image, sometimes as the result of a\n\" suggestion \" inspired by the dream.\nThe degree of acuteness of all the senses in dream is a subject for\ndirect observation, and even\u2014for persons who can at all control their\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 371\ndreams\u2014for direct experiment. I have elsewhere describedi some\nefforts of my own to test my own power of visualisation in dream ;\nwith the result, as I must confess, that I have not found it superior\nto my very low waking capacity. Some correspondents, however, report\na considerable accession of sensory power in dream. An impressive\ndream, dreamt by Mrs. A. W. Verrall, of Cambridge, and at once care\nfully recorded, had for its theme an intensification of each sense in turn.\nMrs. Verrall has poor musical perceptions, and when told in her dream\nthat the sense of sound was next to be exalted, she anticipated little\npleasure. The sensation came, however, as something entirely new,\u2014.\nas \" very harmony, which I had only heard till then in echoes,\u2014in th&\nrhythm of verse, or in the sighing of the wind among the pine-trees.\nMy hearing was purified, not by the fulfilment of desire, but by the\ncreation of desire, which in its very birth attained fruition.'' Others\nspeak of the increased vividness of dramatic conception, or of what is\ncalled in a hypnotic subject \" objectivation of types.\" \" In each of these\ndreams,\" writes one lady, \" I was a man ;\u2014in one of them a low brute,\nin the other a dipsomaniac. I never had the slightest conception of how\nsuch persons felt or thought until these experiences.\" Another corre\nspondent speaks of dreaming two disconnected dreams,\u2014one emotional\nand one geometrical,\u2014simultaneously, and of consequent sense of con\nfusion and fatigue.\nIn Mr. R. L. Stevenson's recent volume, Across the Plains, will be*\nfound a \"Chapter on Dreams,\" which contains the description of the\nmost successful dream-experiments thus far recorded. By self-sugges\ntion before sleep Mr. Stevenson can secure a visual and dramatic\nintensity of dream-representation which has furnished him with the\nmotives for some of his most striking romances. His account, written\nwith admirable psychological insight, is indispensable to students of\nthis subject. Once more, the singular intensity which Iiapjnness may\nassume in dreams,\u2014\" that thoughtless sense of joy bewildering \" which\nseldom recurs in waking life after early youth,\u2014is probably familiar to\nmany of my readers. It seems analogous to the rise in spirits generally\nobserved in somnambulic states,\u2014and perhaps to the ecstacy which\noften seems to accompany some profound upheaval of subliminal strata.\nI am not in this chapter dealing with spontaneous somnambulism ;\nwhich, if regarded as a form of sleep, would of course supply many\nillustrations to my present argument. But Iiefore we leave the\ntopic of dream-hypenesthesia, it may occur to the reader to ask\nwhether ordinary sleep affords any parallel to that form of exalta\ntion of sight so often recorded in somnambulism which enables the\nsubject to \" see in the dark \" ;\u2014to perform complex operations of sewing\nor writing in what appears to others absolute night. This power\ni S.P.S. Proceeding!, Vol. IV., p. 241.\n\f372 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nhowever its highest manifestations may be explained, is in some cases\n.almost certainly a form of hypenesthesia. Can we find anything of the\nsame kind in the condition of the eyes during ordinary sleep ? '\nI believe that with most people, as with myself, there is no special\n-clearness of vision, but rather at first some indistinctness, on opening\nthe eyes from sleep upon a dimly lit room. But we have several\ncases where there is an impression of light on sudden awakening,\nwhich may be a centrally initiated hallucination,\u2014a simple phantasm\n\u2022prolonged from a dream ;\u2014or may, on the other hand, be due to retinal\nhypenesthesia.' We owe the following well-observed instance to Miss\nMason (the Inspectress of boarded-out children under the Local\nGovernment Board), who is already known to our readers as a care\nful witness.\nM. 652.\nWhatcombe, Blandford, Jidy 12th, 1883.\nDear Mr. Myers,- -Faithful to my promise to you, I report that the\nnight before last, the window being open us usual, the wind suddenly rose,\nshook my window and door, and awoke mo out of a sound sleep with a start.\nI am not sure that I saw the whole room, but I saw the door and the window\nfrom which the sound proceeded, or that very small part of the window\nwhich was not (juite covered by a heavy curtain, and I saw the curtain.\nThe light faded almost immediately, and I then perceived that it was a\npitch dark night, no moon (which fact I had observed by looking out of my\nwindow, as I always do, just before getting into bed), and that I could not\nwee anything whatever with my eyes straining, not even where the window\nwas. The two clocks I can hear both struck one as I was trying to see\n\u2022any light.\nAs I saw the door, 1 also saw against it, as it seemed, a sort of lighter\ncoloured framework of bars, and as I knew that there was nothing of the\n:sort in front, or beside the door, I concluded that it was a sudden dream,\nand I had only fancied that I saw what I did. Having heard the clock, I did\nnot strike a light, and went to sleep again. I was awakened twice after in\nthe same way by the wind, but saw no light, nor any object whatever, though\n\u2022I tried my best. I had been asleep a shorter whilo each time, seemingly,\nthan the first.\nWhen I woke at daylight, I discovered that the bars I thought I must\nhave dreamt of were those of the foot of my brass bedstead, and that they\n:stood between me and the door exactly where I had seen them.\nI have been staying here since the 5th inst., long enough to have become\n.acquainted with the objects in my room, though not familiarised with them\nas at home, and I am too absent and preoccupied to be very observant of\nfurniture. And I had never thought of observing, nor noticed, the relative\nposition from where I was of the foot of the bedstead and the door. I\nhave thus been accidentally submitted to the test we proposed, that a strange\ni Compare Professor Joseph Le Conte's account of a supposed spatial representa\ntion of the blind sjwt, seen on awakening.

Of course,\nas I have no witness, this rests only on my word, but I am satisfied myself.\nMy room has two windows, having thick white blinds, and thick curtains\nwith thick lining. I saw only the window from which the noise came. The\ncurtain may have been blown a little aside, but at any rate I could not sou,\nthe window in another few seconds. Yours very truly,\nM. H. Mason.\nI quote this case, because I can find no letter experiment of a like\nkind ; but the possibility of a reproduction of unconscious perception\nis of course not here excluded.\nI de not think that it is yet proved that it is the rested condition of\nthe retina which facilitates these vivid perceptions. Illusions hypnago-\ngiques occur when the retina is presumably fatigued ; and Mrs. Verrall\nhas had hyperesthetic perceptions of light in a dark bedroom (the dim\nchink under the door seen brightly lit), on suddenly waking after a\nshort or restless sleep. I shall be glad to receive communications on\nthis subject.\nIn thus illustrating the reserves of faculty manifested to us by sleep\nand dream I have chosen by preference certain forms of visual\nhyperesthesia. The indications which are to be found of other\nhyperesthesia;,\u2014 as where a dream foretells a malady whose onset has\nnot yet become perceptible to the waking self,\u2014cannot, by the nature\nof the case, admit of comparisons so definite as degrees of the sense\nof sight afford. Enough, I hope, may have been said to suggest,\nsome lines of psychological experiment which offer little difficulty,\nand may bear much fruit.\n(2) The second characteristic of dream to which the discussion\nleads us indicates a force or vividness of a different kind. The\npermanent result of a dream is sometimes such as to show that the\ndream has not been a mere superficial confusion of past waking\nexperiences, but has had an unexplained potency of its own ;\u2014drawn,\nlike the potency of hypnotic suggestion, from some depth in our-\nbeing which the waking self cannot reach. Two main classes of\nthis kind are conspicuous enough to be easily recognised ;\u2014those,,\nnamely, where the dream has led to a \" conversion \" or marked religious\nchange, and those where it has been the starting-point of an \"insistent\nidea \" or a fit of actual insanity.i The dreams which convert, reform,\nchange character and creed, have of course a primAfacie claim to be\nconsidered as something other than ordinary dreams ; and their\ndiscussion may be deferred till a later stage of our inquiry. Those,,\non the other hand, which suddenly generate an insistent idea of an\ni See Dr. Fere in Brain for January, 1887.\n\f374 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nirrational type are closely and obviously analogous to post-hypnotic\nself-suggestions, which the self that inspired them cannot be induced\nto countermand. Such is the dream related by M. Taine,i where a\ngendarme, impressed by an execution at which he has assisted,\ndreams that he is himself to be guillotined, and is afterwards so\ninfluenced by the dream that he attempts suicide. Several cases of\nthis kind have been collected by Dr. Faure2 ; and Dr. Tissi\u00e9, in his\ninteresting little work, Les Rcoes, has added some striking instances\nfrom his own observation. I quote one of M. Faure's cases as a\nsample, showing that in an apparently healthy subject an apparently\ncauseless dream may leave traces quite as persistent as any hypnotic\nsuggestion could implant from without. The dream is in fact a\nself-suggestion of the most potent kind.\nM. 26.\n\" A shop assistant, strongly built and regular in habits, awoke one morn\ning in a state of fever and agitation, perspiring copiously, anxious and\nuneasy. He announced that all his savings were gone ; he was ruined, done\nfor. He said that on the previous day, while driving a van, he had got inUi\na quarrel with a coachman ; and that in the confusion his van had broken in\nthe front window of a mirror-maker. He would have to pay for the damage.\nHe told the story with great detail ; and still saw himself caught round the\nneck by his adversary, who had struck him so violently that he had lost\n\u2022consciousness, and that they had had to carry him into a wine-merchant's\nshop to bring him to. His wife assured us that when he returned home the\nevening before he was in his usual condition ; that he had seen to his busi\nness, passed the evening at home, and gone to bed with no trouble upon\nhim.\n\" For three days X. continued in this frame of mind, unable to calm him\nself for a moment, although he was taken to the actual place where the\nimaginary accident had occurred. It was some days later before he\nthoroughly understood that it had been a dream. And for a whole month he\nwould fall daily into the same confusion of memory ;\u2014would sit down in\ndespair, crying and repeating ' We are ruined ! ' Even seven years after\nwards he still had occasional crises of this nature, when he forgot the truth,\nand lived for several days under the shock of this imaginary disaster.\"\nWe may compare with this a case where \" the touch of a vanished\nhand \" appeared to bring physical relief to a dreamer.\nM. 27.\nFrom Mr. H.

As I was\nthen young, and had just entered on a career of labour which I wished to\nfollow for a long time, I became very despondent at such a prospect. In\nthis depressed condition I fell into a sleep which was not very profound, and\nthe following circumstance, which is still fresh in my mind, appeared to take\nplace. My sister, who had been dead more than 20 years, and whom I had\nalmost forgotten, came to my bedside, and said, '' Do not worry about your\nhealth, we have come to cure you ; there is much yet for you to do in the\nworld.\" Then she vanished, and my brain seemed to be electrified as if by\na shock from a battery, only it was not painful, but delicious. The shock\nspread downwards, and over the chest and lungs it was very strong. From\nhere it extended to the extremities, where it appeared like a delightful glow.\nI awoke almost immediately, and found myself well. Since then I have\nnever had an attack of the disease. The form of my sister was indistinct,\nbut the voice was very plain, and I have never before had such an experience,\nnor since. M. L. Holbrook, M.D.\nCompare this again with Dr. Tissi\u00e9's account of his hysterical\nsubject, Albert. \" Every time,\" said Albert, \" that I dream that I have\nbeen bitten or beaten I suffer all day in the part attacked.\"i\nA still more striking illustration may be drawn from the following\nincident in the story of Krafft-Ebing's patient,2 lima S., already men\ntioned :\u2014\nM. 28.\n\"May 6th, 1888.\u2014The patient is disturbed to-day. She complains to the\nsister of severe pain under the left breast, thinks that the professor has burnt\nher in the night, and begs the sister to obtain a retreat for her in a convent,\nwhere she will be secure against such attacks. The sister's refusal causes a\nhystero-epileptic attack. [At length, in the hypnotic trance] the patient\ngives the following explanation of the origin of the pain :\u2014' Last night an old\nman came to me ; he looked like a priest and came in company with a sister\nof charity, on whose collet there was a large golden B. I was afraid of her.\nThe old man was amiable and friendly. He dipped a pen in the sister's\npocket, and with it wrote a W and B on my skin under the left breast. Once\nhe dipped his pen badly and made a blot in the middle of the figure. This\nspot and the B pain me severely, but the W does not. The man explained\nthe W as meaning that I should go to the M church and confess at the W\nconfessional.'\n\" After this account the patient cried out and said, ' There stands the man\nagain. Now he has chains on his hands.'\n\" When the patient woke into ordinary life she was suffering pain in the\nplace indicated, where there wero ' superficial losses of substance, penetrating\nto the corium, which have a resemblance to a reversed W and B,' with ' a\nhypenemic raised spot between the two.'

It has induced no fictive murders, but death itself. We\nhave several cases where an announcement made in dream of the date\nof the dreamer's decease has been punctually fulfilled. In Proceedings,\nVol. V., p. 291, Mrs. Sidgwick has quoted a case of this kind, where the\ndeath was not traceable to any known disease. I give here a case\nrendered still more perplexing by the repetition of the warning dream.\nP. 27.\nAbout 60 years ago a Mrs. Carleton died in the County of Leitrim. Sho\nand my late mother were very intimate, and a few days after her death she\nappeared to my mother in a dream, and said that never again even in dreams\nshould my mother see her except once, which would be 24 hours before she\nshould die. In March, 1864, my mother was living with my son-in-law and\ndaughter, Dr. and Mrs. Lyon, in Dalkey. On the evening of the 2nd March\nmy mother went to her room in very good spirits, laughing and joking with\nMrs. Lyon. That night, or rather early next morning, Dr. Lyon, hearing\nsome noise in my mother's room, awoke Mrs. Lyon, and sent her in to see if\nall was right. She found my mother hanging half out of bed with an expres\nsion of horror on her countenance. They got her into bed and all right.\nNext morning she seemed in her usual health, and ate her breakfast as\nusual, in bed, but heartily. On my daughter leaving her she asked the\nservant to bring up water for a bath, which she took. She then sent for\nMrs. Lyon, and told her that Mrs. Carleton had, after a delay of 56 years,\nat last come, and told her of her speedy death, and that she would die next\nmorning at the same hour as they had found her as described. She added\nthat she had bathed preparatory to her death to avoid having her body\nwashed. She now gradually began to sink, and died on the morning of the\n4th March, at the hour she had said.\nDr. and Mrs. Lyon can corroborate this account. My mother always told\nme she would once more, just before death, see Mrs. Carleton.\nThomas James Norms.\nDalkey, Ireland.\nFrom Dr. Lyon, 1, Tempe'-terrace, Dalkey, Co. Dublin.\nAugust 30th, 1883.\nTho late Mrs. Dorcas Norris, referred to in your letter, frequently in her\nlifetime mentioned that a Mrs. Eliza Carleton had appeared to her in a dream,\n\u00bbnd promised to appear once more to her 24 hours before her death. On the\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness, 377\nnight before her death my wife went into her room, and found her almost\ninsensible ; next day she said that the warning she had been waiting for for\n56 years had been given, and that she would die during next night, which\nshe did.\nRichard St. John Lyon.\nThis narrative is capable of interpretation in any one of three ways.\nAs readers of these Proceedings know, I am myself quite willing to\nivdmit the supposition that the departed Mrs. Carleton really knew of her\nfriend's impending decease ;\u2014and that both dreams were impressed\ntelepathically by a discarnate upon an incarnate mind. But we may also\nsuppose that the first dream, though purely accidental, made so deep\nan impression that when it recurred\u2014also by accident\u2014it proved\ntantamount to a self-suggestion of death. Or we may suppose that the\nfirst dream was accidental, but that the second was symbolic, and in\nduced by some organic sensation which preluded imminent death, but\nwas perceptible in sleep before it was felt on awakijtg.\nThere are, however, cases in which these dream-predictions of\ndeath are made so long beforehand, and with so much latitude as to\nthe exact date fixed for the decease, that it is difficult to conceive that\na self-suggestion is bringing its own fulfilment. The following case, for\ninstance, may be a mere coincidence, as Mr. Browning suggests ; but if\nit be more than a coincidence it is probably also more than a self-\nsuggestion.\nP. 142.\nLife and Letters of Robert Browning.

She saw her [Mrs. Browning], and asked\n\"When shall I be with you 1 \" The reply was, \"Dearest, in five years,\" where\nupon Arabella woke. She knew in her dream that it was not to the living\nshe spoke.' In five years, within a month of completion\u2014I have forgotten,\nthe date of the dream and supposed it was only three years ago, and that\ntwo had still to ran. Only a coincidence, but noticeable.\"\nOur choice of explanation in such cases must largely depend upon\nour view as to a problem discussed in another paper ;\u2014the question,\nwhether phantasms of the departed do really in any case indicate a con\ntinued knowledge of any terrene event or eventuality. But bs it noted\nthat if in cases like these we reject the more marvellous explanation,\u2014\nthe hypothesis that the departed friend is actually warning the sur\nvivor,\u2014we are driven to admit that dream has an unequalled potency\n2 c\n\f37S Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nof suggestion,\u2014is linked with those forces which we have already noted\nas like springs in a river-bed, perturbing the stream of our being by\nuprushes which we can neither fathom nor foresee.\n(3) I pass on to the lessons which are to be learnt from the\npeculiarities of dream-memory. The first point which I have marked\nfor notice need not delay us long. Most persons experienced in hyp\nnotism have come across incidents illustrating the affinity between\nmemory in dream and memory in hypnotic trance. We know of\ncourse that dreams can be inspired by hypnotic suggestion ;\u2014as when\nM. de Rochas, in a case personally known to me, caused a young man\nwho was neglecting his parents to dream that he himself was a father,\nand that his children were neglecting him. The salutary distress which\nthis dream inspired led to a more filial line of conduct. But there is a\nconnection closer than this. For without any suggestion to that effect,\nacts accomplished in the hypnotic trance may be remembered in dream ;\n\u2014and remembered under the illusion which was thrown round them by\nthe hypnotiser. Thus Dr. Auguste Voisin suggested to a hypnotised\nsubject to stab a patient (really a stuffed figure) in a neighbouring bed.i\nThe subject did so; and of course knew nothing of it on waking.\nBut three days afterwards he returned to the hospital, complaining that\nhis dreams were haunted by the figure of a woman, who accused him of\nhaving stabbed and killed her. Appropriate suggestion laid this ghost\nof a doll.\nConversely, dreams forgotten in waking life may be remembered\nin the hypnotic trance. Thus Dr. Tissi^'s patient, Albert, dreamt\nthat he was about to set out on one of his somnambulic \"fugues,\"\nor aimless journeys, and when hypnotised mentioned to the physician\nthis dream, which in his waking state he had forgotten.2 The prob\nable truth of this statement was shown by the fact that he did\nactually set out on the journey thus dreamt of,\u2014and that his journeys\nwere usually preceded and incited by remembered dreams.\nI need not dwell on the existence, but at the same time the\nincompleteness, of our dream-memory of waking life ; nor on the\noccasional formation of a separate chain of memory, constructed from\nsuccessive and cohering dreams.\n(4) My next anticipation was that dream-memory would occasionally\nbe found to fill up gaps in waking memory, other than those due to\nhypnotic trance ;\u2014such so-called \"ecmnesic\" periods, for instance, as\nsometimes succeed a violent shock to the system,\u2014and may even embrace\nsome space of time anterior to the shock. Such accidents, however,\n1 Revue de VHypnotitme, June, 1891, p, 302.\n2 Lea Rtvet, p. 135. This remarkable patient afforded examples of many forma\nof communication of memory between different states of personality. See pji. 192-200\nfor a conspectus of these complex recollections.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 379\nare so rare, and such dream-memory so hard to detect, that I mention\nthe point mainly for ' the sake of theoretical completeness ; and must\nthink myself fortunate in being able to cite a recent case of M.\nCharcot's which affords an interesting confirmation of the suggested\nview.i\nM. 29.\nA certain Madame D., a healthy and sensible woman of thirty-four, was\nsubjected on August 28th, 1891, to a terrible shock. Some scoundrel who\nhas not been identified entered her cottage and told her brusquely that her\nhusband was dead, and that his corpse was being brought home. This was\nabsolutely false ; but the news threw her into a state of profound agitation ;\nand when some indiscreet friend, seeing the husband approach, cried out\nLe noila ! the poor woman, supposing that the corpse was thus announced,\nfell into a prolonged hysterical attack. After two days of raving she came\nto herself ;\u2014but had lost the memory of all events since July 14th ;\u2014\ni.e., since a date six weeks before the shock. This kind of retroactive\necmnesia\u2014inexplicable as it is\u2014is known to occur sometimes after a\nphysical concussion. In Madame D.'s case the shock had been wholly\na mental one ; yet the forgetfulness continued, and had spread over all the\nperiod up to M. Charcot's lecture on the case, December 22nd, 1891.\nMadame D. was then possessed of full recollection of her life up to July 14th,\n1891 ;\u2014but she could recall no event whatever which had occurred since\nthat date. She endeavoured to continue her domestic duties ; but if she\nwished to recollect anything she had to write it down instantly in a note\nbook, to which she constantly referred. For instance, she was bitten by a\ndog believed to be mad. She instantly made a written note of the fact ;\u2014\nbut except when actually referring to her note-book she retained no\nrecollection whatever of the bite or of her subsequent treatment in M.\nPasteur's laboratory.\nHere, surely, was a case where it might have seemed that there had\nbeen some absolute evanescence, absolute abolition of whatsoever traces\nor tendencies may be held to constitute memory.\nBut one fact was observed which threw a decisive light upon this\npuzzling case. The patients in the two beds adjoining Madame D.'s were\ntold to observe her at night. They reported that she was in the habit of\ntalking in her sleep ;\u2014and that in the fragments of dreams thus revealed she\nmade frequent allusions to the mad dog's bite, and to other events which had\noccurred during her ecmnesic period. This hint, of course, was enough for\nM. Charcot. Classing her ecmnesia as a kind of prolongation of a hystero-\ni?pileptic attack, he hypnotised the patient, and found that in the hypnotic\ntrance her memory for the ecmnesic period was absolutely intact. Post\nhypnotic suggestions to remember the lost days are now slowly restoring the\npoor woman to the possession of her whole past.\nThe fact which interests us here is the accidentally-discovered\npersistence in dream of memories which had vanished from the supra\nliminal consciousness. This shows that in dream Madame D. had got\n\u2022 Revue de Afidecine, February, 1802.\n2 C 2\n\f380 Mr. F. W. H. Myer%\ndown\u2014not merely to a stratum of confusion,\u2014but to a state so far\ndeeper than the waking state that the memories of which shock or\nhysteria had robbed the waking state were there found to he un\ninjured. This well-observed case may here stand as representative of\nthe gap-filling dream-memory which I ventured to anticipate. Other\ncases will be noticeable when spontaneous somnambulism comes under\nreview,\u2014in its complex relations with common dreams, hypnotism,\nhysteria, and even epilepsy.\n(5) I pass on to the still more novel and curious questions involved in\nthe apparent existence of a dream-memory which, while accompanying\nthe memory of ordinary life, seems also to have a wider purview, and\nto indicate that the record of external events which is kept within us\nis far fuller than we know.\nLet us consider what stages such a memory may show.\nI. It may include events once known to the waking self, but now\ndefinitely forgotten.\nII. It may include facts which have fallen within the sensory field,\nbut which have never been supraliminally \" apperceived \" or cognised\nin any way.\nIII. It may indicate that from this wider range of remembered\nfacts dvesim-inferences have been drawn ;\u2014which inferences may be\nretrospective, prospective, or,\u2014if I may use a word of Pope's with a new\nmeaning,\u2014circumspective,\u2014that is to say, relating not to the past or to\nthe future, but to the present condition of matters beyond the range\nof ordinary perception. It is plain that inferences of this kind (if they\nexist) will be liable to be mistaken for direct retrocognition, direct\npremonition, direct clairvoyance ; while yet they need not actually\nprove anything more than a perception on the part of the subliminal\nself more far-reaching,\u2014a memory more stable,\u2014than is the perception\nor the memory of the supraliminal self which we know.\nUp to this point I propose to follow dream-memories in the present\nchapter ;\u2014up to this point, or rather into this dubious Iwrderland\nwhere it is not certain whether supernormal powers\u2014direct telepathy,\nclairvoyance, prevision,\u2014need or need not be invoked to explain the\nphenomena of dream. As my reader knows, I shall not shrink from\ninvoking such powers, when they seem indispensable. But with our\npresent knowledge we must not assume them until other explanations\nare exhausted ; and these hypermnesic dreams afford a means of drawing\nour lines' of evidence more exactly ;\u2014of relegating some marvellous\nnarratives to a realm of lesser marvel, and at the same time of\nrealising more clearly what it is in the most advanced cases which\nordinary theories are really powerless to explain.\nI. As to the Jirsl of the above-mentioned categories no one will raise\nany doubt. It is a familiar fact\u2014or a fact only sufficiently unfamiliar\n\fThe Stibliminal Consciousness. .381\nto be noted with slight surprise\u2014that we occasionally recover in sleep\na memory which has wholly dropped out of waking consciousness. As\nan example, we may take the dream of M. Delboeuf's, discussed in his\ninteresting book, Le Sommeil et leg Reves. In that dream the name\nof the \" Asplenium Ruta Muralis \" figured as a familiar phrase. On\nwaking he puzzled himself in vain to think where he could have learnt\nthat botanical appellation. Long afterwards he discovered the name\n\" Asplenium Ruta Muraria\" in his own handwriting,\u2014in a little col\nlection of flowers and ferns to which he had added their designations,\nunder the dictation of a botanical friend.\nIn this and similar cases the original piece of knowledge had at the\ntime made a definite impress on the mind,\u2014had come well within the\nspan of apprehension of the supraliminal consciousness. Its reappearance\nafter however long an interval is a fact to which there are already\nplenty of parallels. But the conclusion to which the cases about to be\ncited seem to me to point is one of a much stranger character. I think\nthat there is evidence to show that many facts or pictures which have\nnever even for a moment come within the apprehension of the supra\nliminal consciousness are nevertheless retained by the subliminal\nmemory, and are occasionally presented in dreams with what seems a\ndefinite purpose.\nThe reader may remember that this claim has already been ad\nvanced for crystal-vision.'- Miss X. saw in the crystal the announce\nment of the death of a friend ;\u2014a piece of news which certainly had\nnever been apprehended by her ordinary conscious self. On referring\nto the Times, it was found that the announcement was contained in a\nsheet with which Miss X. had screened her face from the fire ;\u2014so that\nthe words may have fallen within her range of vision, although they\nhad not reached what we call her waking mind.\nThis instance, was of value from the completeness of the proof that\nthe news could never have been supraliminally known at all ;\u2014since it\nwas too important to have been merely glanced at and forgotten.\nWe shall find that in some dream-presentations the proof of supra\nliminal ignorance is equally strong. Let us begin, however, with some\nintermediate instances.\nM. 30.\nFrom Mr. A. Brockelbank, 20, Marsden-road, East Dulwich, S.E.\nJvly 14tfi, 1884.\nSome years ago I lost a pocket-knife. I think it was some six months\nafterwards\u2014when I had forgotten entirely the loss of the knife, and the sub\nject never recurred to my memory in any way whatever\u2014I dreamt one night\nthat it was in the pocket of a certain pair of trousers I had cast off, I suppose\ni Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 507.\n\f382 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nabout the same time as the loss of my knife. I awoke, and lay awake some\ntime, till it occurred to me to prove the truth of my dream. I went upstairs\nin search of the said pair of trousers, and sure enough there it was as I had\ndreamt. The peculiarity of the above is this, that when I was awake and in\nmy senses no train of thought or retracing of my memory would carry me\nback to the pair of trousers or to the knife, and it was quite as an experi\nment that I went in search of them.\nAuoustus Brockelbank.\nThis is much such a flash of memory as might sometimes occur in\nwaking hours, for it is probable that Mr. Brockelbank had at one time\nobserved, that the knife was in that pocket. He may have very rapidly\nforgotten the fact ; but nevertheless there was probably some supra\nliminal knowledge for the dream to revive.\nNext let us take another case of a lost object, where waking effort\nsoon after the loss fails to recall any supraliminal knowledge of the place\nof deposit. This case was printed in the S.P.R. Journal, October, 18S9.\nM. 31.\nFebruary 4th, 1889.\nOn reaching Morley's Hotel at 5 o'clock on Tuesday, 29th January, 1889,\nI missed a gold brooch, which I supposed I had left in a fitting room at\nSwan and Edgar's. I sent there at once, but was very disappointed to hear\nthat after a diligent search they could not find the brooch. I was very vexed,\nand worried about the brooch, and that night dreamed that I should find it\nshut up in a number of the Queen newspaper that had been on the table, and\nin my dream I saw the very page where it would be. I had noticed one of\nthe plates on that page. Directly after breakfast I went to Swan and Edgar's\nand asked to see the papers, at the same time telling the young ladies about\nthe dream, and where I had seen the brooch. The papers had been moved\nfrom that room, but were found, and to the astonishment of the young ladies,\nI said, \"This is the one that contains my brooch \" ; and there at the very\npage 1 expected I found it.\nA. M. Bickford-Smith.\nWe received a substantially similar account from Mrs. Bickford-\nSmith's brother-in-law, Mr. H. A. Smith, who was a witness of the\ntrouble taken to find the brooch, both at the hotel, and by sending to\nSwan and Edgar's, on the previous evening.\nYet here, be it observed, Mrs. Bickford-Smith had not had an\nopportunity of herself inspecting the scene of the loss. Had she\nreturned to Swan and Edgar's before the dream, it is possible that the\nsight of the books on the table might have revived some recollection of\nseeing the brooch between the leaves of the Queen.\nIn the next case we cannot absolutely prove that Mrs. Yates did\nnot put the photographs in the drawer herself,\u2014or casually see that\na parcel was in the drawer, if someone else put them there,\u2014but the\nfact of the long search, of the refusal to believe the dream, makes this\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 383\nexplanation dubious. I may add that Mrs. Yates (known to Mr.\nGurney and myself) has had other experiences,\u2014of a telepathic or\nclairvoyant kind.\nM. 315.\nFrom Mrs. Yates, 44, Montpelier-road, Brighton. 1884.\nAbout five years since I had sent me, by a friend, some unmounted\nphotographs of \"The Stations of the Cross,\" taken in miniature from\nfrescoes at Rome, with the request that after inspection I would immediately\nreturn them, as they were valued. I placed them in an envelope, and, as\nI thought, in the secretaire, but on finishing a letter in which I intended to\nreturn them, to my dismay, they were nowhere to be found. We searched\nunceasingly, but fruitlessly. I submitted meekly to reproofs for my care\nlessness, and so the matter passed out of thought.\nMore than a twelvemonth after I dreamt I took out a top short drawer in\na wardrobe that stood in a then unused dressing-room, and found the little\npictures. It will naturally be asked, \"Did you not, the first thing in the\nmorning, ascertain whether your dream had anything in it, by removing the\ndrawer '\/ \" I did not. I mentioned it to my family, but it had no special\ninterest for them, and it was no more thought of ; but several months after,\non the removal of the wardrobe to another part of the house, the drawers\nbeing taken out to lighten it, there, snugly enough, lay the envelope and the\nlittle pictures '. I have them mounted and framed.\nI subjoin another case of the same type.\nM. 32.\nThe wife of the Rev. W. F. Brand, Emmorton, Harford Co., Mary\nland, writes as follows, under date Findowsay, March 29th, 1884 :\u2014\nMr. Brand asked me one day to give him the 100 dollars that he had\ngiven me to put away for him. I felt startled, for I did not remember that\nhe had given them to me. However, I went to the place where I usually put\nmoney and looked. It was not there. I looked in several other not\nimprobable places, but could not find it. By degrees I searched in every\ndrawer, and box, and corner, likely or unlikely, or even impossible, but\nwithout success. Night came and I had not found it. I was much disturbed,\nfor the loss was a large one for us ; but even more than for the loss we were\nconcerned at the thought of anyone about me having taken it. Before\ngoing to bed I prayed very earnestly that I might find it ; or, if not, that\nsuspicion might not fall upon an innocent person. In the course of the night\nI dreamt that I found the money in the middle of a bundle of shawls that\nhad been put away during the summer, and carefully wrapped up for protec\ntion against moths. In my daylight mind this place seemed to me an absurd\none to look in, but my dream impressed me a good deal, and I unfastened\nthe shawls\u2014(I think they were sewed up)\u2014and there was the lost treasure.\nI should like to say whether my dream wakened me in the night, but I\ndo not remember. I did not look until the morning. I never have been\nable to recall the fact of my putting the money away, nor, indeed, of Mr.\nBrand giving it into my care, although it was an unusual thing for him to do\nin those days.\n\f384 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nI think Nydie's finding her ring by a dream was a more curious circum\nstance than this with regard to my money, but I always am afraid to tell\nboth dreams, as they happened to Histers, lest one should discredit the other,\nand we should be regarded as fanciful.i\nNext let us take two cases where it seems quite impossible to\nsuppose that the seeker's supraliminal consciousness was ever aware of\nthe lost object's true position,\u2014as the object would then at once have\nbeen picked up. But on the other hand (as in Miss X.'s crystal case,\nabove cited), the object may have come within the seeker's field of\nvision, and may thus have become enrolled in the subliminal memory.\nM. (CI.) 303.\nFrom Mrs. Crellin, 62, Hilldrop-crescent, N. 1884.\nWhen a school girl I one day foolishly removed from my French teacher's\nhand a ring, which I, in fun, transferred to my own. On removing it from\nmy finger just before going to bed, I found that a stone had fallen out of the\nring, and I was much troubled about it, especially as the ring had been\ngiven to my teacher. We had four class rooms, and as I had been moving from\none to another in the course of the evening, I could not hope to find the lost\nutone. I, however, in my dreams that night saw the stone lying on a\ncertain plank in the floor of our \" drilling room,\" and on awaking I dressed\nhastily and went direct to the spot marked in my dream, and recovered the\nlost stone. This narrative has nothing thrilling in it, but its simplicity and\nexactness may commend it to your notice.\nMr. Gurney adds :\u2014In conversation with me, Mrs. Crellin described the\nfour class rooms as good sized rooms, which it would have taken a long time\nto search over. She had been about in all of them in the course of the\nevening. She is positive that she went quite straight to the spot. She is an\nexcellent witness.\nMrs. J. Windsor Stuart, of Foley House, Rothesay, N.B.,\u2014well\nknown to me,\u2014contributes a similar experience, but with the additional\npoint of interest that the ring was seen, not as it must have looked\nwhen searched for, but glistening with dew, as it actually was at the\ntime of the dream. The incident is remote ; but Mr. Stuart remem-\nliers being told of the incident in the same form much nearer the\nactual date.\nM. 33.\nJanuary 30th, 1892.\nIn the early autumn of 1864, my father (the late Captain Wm.

I would not have done this for the world ; it belonged to my\nfather. I remember seeing it as I rang the bell, on arriving, so that it must\nhave dropped out since I came here.\" We all set to work to hunt for the\nstone by walking up and down the lawn in line, but without success.\nThere were two copper-beech trees, one just on the lawn near the house,\nthe other a little further back, above the embankment made in laying off the\nlawn, but spreading a little over it. In the early morning I dreamed I saw\nthe stone shining under a leaf that had fallen from the tree, close to the edge\nof the bank. I saw the whole scene vividly, the dew drops sparkling in\nthe sun, and the stone, in my dream. I woke so much impressed by my\ndream that I at once got up and dressed, and went out. It was about six\no'clock on a lovely morning. I went out by the garden door directly on to\nthe lawn, and walked up to the tree, seeing everything as in my dream, and\nfound the stone without further looking, just under the leaf, as I had seen it.\nFlora Stuart.\nThe three cases which follow were published by Professor Royce,\nof Harvard (who knows the real names of the informants), in the Pro\nceedings of the American S.P.R., Vol. I., No. 4, March, 1889.i\n\"The first case,\" says Professor Royce, \"comes to us from a lady\n(M. B.) to whom we had applied for an account of another and more\nremarkable experience, which she was unable, however, to relate to us\nat present. As a compensation she gave us this less important\nexperience, of whose incidents she feels very sure \" :\u2014\nM. 35.\nA number of years ago I was invited to visit a friend who lived at a large\nand beautiful country-seat on the Hudson. Shortly after my arrival I started,\nwith a number of other guests, to make a tour of the very extensive grounds.\nWe walked for an hour or more, and very thoroughly explored the place\nUpon my return to the house I discovered that I had lost a gold cuff-\nstud, that I valued for association's sake. I merely remembered that I wore\nit when we started out, and did not think of or notice it again until my\nreturn, when it was missing. As it was quite dark, it seemed useless to\nsearch for it, especially as it was the season of autumn and the ground was\ncovered with dead leaves. That night I dreamed that I saw a withered\ngrape-vine clinging to a wall, and with a pile of dead leaves at the base.\nUnderneath the leaves, in my dream, I distinctly saw my stud gleaming.\nThe following morning I asked the friends with whom I had been walking the\nprevious afternoon if they remembered seeing any such wall and vine, as I\ndid not. They replied that they could not recall anything answering the\ndescription. I did not tell them why I asked, as I felt somewhat ashamed of\nthe dream, but during the morning I made some excuse to go out in the\ngrounds alone. I walked hither and thither, and after a long time I suddenly\ncame upon the wall and vine exactly as they looked in my dream. I had not\nthe slightest recollection of seeing them or passing by them on the previous\ni Since the American S.P.R. became a Branch of our Society, it has ceased to\npublish separate Proceedings.

I\napproached cautiously, feeling rather uncomfortable and decidedly silly, and\npushed them aside. I had scattered a large number of the leaves when a\ngleam of gold struck my eye, and there lay the stud, exactly as in my dream.\nMy friends refused to believe when I told them, and vowed there was some\ntrick about it, but as I had not told anyone the particulars of the dream,\nthat was impossible, and the matter will always be somewhat \" uncanny \" in,\nmy memory.\n\"The next case,\" continues Professor Royce, \"depends upon a memory\nof many years' standing, and, were it not for the cleverness and the\nfreedom from superstition which the narrator shows, I should lay no\nstress upon the incident. But pretty plainly something of the sort did\noccur to our correspondent, although, after twenty-five years, memory\nis a poor guide, and obviously his story has been often told by him\":\u2014.\nM. 36.\n(From C. H. H., C.E., and Surveyor.)\nCalifornia, December 26th, 1887.\nUpwards of twenty-five years ago I was residing on the banks of the\nDelaware river, in Sullivan co., State of New York. Before I left home\nmy only sister had presented me with a gold ring and told me to never\nlose it. In a beautiful little grove near the bank of said river a lot of\nus young folks had fixed up a scup, or swing, among the trees, and we\nindulged in that pastime to that extent that the land immediately under the\nswing became so lively that my foot would make a deep impression. One\nbeautiful moonlight night, after getting tired of swinging, I had seen my\nbest girl home, as in duty bound, and was returning along towards morning,\nas usual, when I missed my ring. It gave me quite a shock when I made\nthat discovery ; the first impression I had was\u2014there, I've lost that ring,\nbut it must be found, and that I would find it. Went home and searched\nround my room and went to bed. Had a hazy sort of dream about the ring,\nbut nothing definite. Got up early and searched before breakfast. After\nbreakfast followed the direction we had taken the night before to the\nswing, and from there to the young lady's home ; but found it not. In fact,\nI searched diligently all day, and went to bed thinking very seriously of\nthe ring. Along towards morning had a very impressive dream. I saw\nthe ring, covered by a little ridge of sand, between two footprints under\nthe swing. That dream was so vivid that on awaking I could see the road,\nbuildings, fences, trees, swmg, and sand, with the footprints therein, the\nsame as in the dream, and as soon as it was light enough to see I started\nfor that swing, not attempting t\u00ab look for it on the way. On arriving at\nthe swing I walked deliberately into the sand until I reached the before-\nmentioned ridge, between said footprints, and with the toe of my boot re\nmoved a little sand from the top of the ridge, and out rolled the ring. The\nbirds were singing overhead in the trees, the river was rushing on its way\nto the sea, a train of cars on the York and Erie R.R. across the river passed\nalong. I banged my head several times with my fist, to make sure I was\nnot still in the hmd of dreams ; no, I was there, standing in the sand, and\nthere laid the ring. There was no hallucination about that, but a good,\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 387\nsquare, honest, useful dream. I picked up the ring, and went home, and\nate more for breakfast than I had in the last twenty-four hours, and I kept\nup an awful thinking, and am thinking yet. I would state I was about nine\nteen years of age at that time, enjoyed perfect health, and thought I knew\nmore than all creation ; but don't think so now. My sister was also living at\nthat time.\nSeveral years after the above I had another dream, and the last one ; but\nthis has been so long that I will close for this time to see what you think of\nit, and whether the second will be of interest to you, and will merely remark\nthat I have endeavoured to work this dream business up to a practical use in\nthe years gone by ; but it has been a total failure, so far\u2014can't concentrate\nthe mind with that intenseness that seems to be necessary with me to bring\nforth dreams.\n\"Anyone used to narratives,\" continues Professor Royce, \"recognises\nat once that this story, as I have suggested, has grown not a little with\nyears, and I am not sure of more than that it has a probable founda\ntion in fact, and is no doubt sincerely told.\n\" The third case to be quoted in this connection has a better basis,\nand is more critically told.\n\" The narrator is a Southern gentleman, Col.

I have noticed your\ninterview, in which you say that you request any person having some\nunusual experience, such as an exceptionally vivid dream, &c, &c, should\naddress you. The following seems to me a very extraordinary dream, for\nthe truth of which I pledge you my word of honour.\nAbout five years ago I lived with my four children, one boy and three\ngirls, on a farm in Massachusetts. This only son, at the age of about four\nteen years, lost his life in an accident, about six months previous to this\nnarration. The youngest of my girls was the pet sister of his since her\nbirth. My wife had died some six years previous to this story ; being\nmotherless, made these children unusually affectionate toward each other.\nOne day I had occasion to buy for my girls each a very small lady's knife,\nabout two and a half inches long. A few days afterwards the girls received\ncompany from our neighbours' girls, some five or six of them. My youngest\none, some eight or nine years old, was so delighted with this, her first knife,\nthat she carried it with her at all times. During the afternoon the children\nstrolled to the large barn, filled with hay, and at once set to climbing the\nmow to play, and jumping on the hay. During the excitement of the play\nmy little girl lost her knife. This terrible loss nearly broke her heart, and\nall hands set to work to find the lost treasure, but without success. This\nfinally broke up the party in gloominess. In spite of my greatest efforts to\npacify the child with all sorts of promises, she went to bed weeping. During\nthe night the child dreamed that her dead dear beloved brother came to her,\ntaking her by the hand, saying, '' Come, my darling, I will show you where\nyour little knife is,\" and, leading her to the barn, climbing the mow, showed\nher the knife, marking the place. The dream was so life-like that she awoke,\njoyfully telling her sister that her brother had been here, and showing her\nwhere she would find her knife. Both girls hastily dressed, and running tq\n\f388 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nthe barn, the little girl, assisted by her sister, got on top of the hay, and\nwalked direct to the spot indicated by her brother, and found the knife on\ntop of the hay. The whole party said that they all looked there many times\nthe day before, and insisted that the knife was not there then.\nThis, I think, is a very remarkable dream.\u2014Yours, &c.\n\" In answer to a request for further confirmation,\" continues Pro\nfessor Royce, \" our correspondent writes, under date of December 29th,\n1887 \" :\u2014\nM. 37.\nYours of December 22nd inst. to hand. According to your request I will\ngive the statement of my girls. The little dreamer says :\u2014\n\" I have a very vivid recollection of my dream up to this day. I could\nto-day walk every step that I walked in my dream with brother. I cannot\nrecollect at what time of the night I had my dream. I don't think I ever\nwas awake during the night, but, on waking in the morning, I had the feel\nmg that I was sure I could go and get the knife. I told my sisters. They\nat first laughed at my dream, but I insisted that brother had shown me the\nknife, and I could not have peace in my mind until I went to the barn to get\nit. One sister went with me. On reaching the hay, I told her to let me go\nahead, and walked direct to the spot without hesitating a moment, and\npicked up my knife ! \"\nShe never had any other similar experience, and no other similar u\\1ie-\nrience happened in my family. The sister who went along with her says :\u2014\n\" As we got up and were dressing, sister told me she knew where her\nknife was ; that brother took her out to the barn during the night and\nshowed it to her. I laughed and tried to persuade her that this was only a\ndream, but she said that she was so sure of seeing the knife that she would\nshow it to me. She said that brother took her by the hand, and led\nher to the place, talking to her all the way, and tried to quiet her. She\nwould not give peace until I went along. On getting on top of the hay she\nwalked direct to the spot, saying, 'Here brother picked the knife up out\nof the hay,' and at once said, 'and oh, here it is,' picking up the knife.\nWe had been looking this place all over, again and again, the previous\nevening.\"\nFor the following incident, resembling those just quoted from\nProfessor Royce, we have the independent account of the dreamer\nhimself, written two years later ; but as his narrative is somewhat\ndisjointed we prefer to give that kindly sent to us by Miss Ada\nHunt, of Pen Villa, Yeovil, which has the further advantage of having\nbeen written at the time.\nM. 38.\nThe following rather remarkable dream took place on the 20th November,\n1886. On that day I gave to our gardener, G. Wilmot, his wages, 15s. , in a\nhalf-sheet of paper, some letters to post, and two parcels and a note to leave\nat various houses on his way home. This was at six o'clock in the evening.\n. . . About an hour after the gardener returned to tell me he had lost his,\n\fThe Subliminal Connsciousness. 389\nwages. I advised him to carefully retrace his steps and make every inquiry,\nbut this he did without success ; and as it was \"fair\" night and the town\nfull of people, he at last gave it up as hopeless and returned to his home\nquite a mile distant. During the night he dreamt that he went to one of the\nhouses where he had left a note, and, crossing the road after leaving it, he\nwalked into a mud heap, and that there his foot struck the paper containing\nthe money ; the half-sovereign rolled away and the 5s. remained under his\nfoot. He told his wife the dream, and falling asleep again he dreamt tho\nsame dream again. Early in the morning he went to the place and found\nhis dream fulfilled to the letter, even to the rolling away of the gold, and\nthe silver remaining in its place.\nHe is a most intelligent, truthful man.\nThe gardener's own account differs from this in giving fewer details\nas to the dream ; his account of it is : \"I dreamt I had found it and\nkicked the half-sovereign off the heap.\" Miss Hunt thinks that his\nnervousness at writing himself made him forget to say that he dreamt\nexactly where the money was found. He had so little belief in his\ndream that he tossed up as to whether he should go to look for the\nmoney again or not.\nIn the following case the dream itself first calls the attention of\nthe supraliminal self to the loss.\nWe owe this case to the kindness of Miss J. H. Symons, of 91,\nWigmore-street, W., to whom the case was sent by the percipient,\nMrs. Bell, of 7, Albert-road, Gloucester Gate, Regent's Park.\nM. 39.\nOne morning in the early part of December (December 9th, 1890), I\nawoke remembering my dream, and repeated it to Mr. Bell as being a piece\nof good fortune that my diamond had not been lost ! I dreamed that I\nhad lost the large centre diamond in some sand. I was much distressed,\nand hunted in the sand and found it, and wrapped it in paper, and asked\nmy daughter to take care of it for me. I very often leave my brooch on the\nmantel shelf at night and put it away with my other jewellery in the morning.\nWhile I was dressing my dream haunted me and I thought, \"Well, I had\nbetter look and see where my brooch is.\" I looked\u2014there was no brooch.\nI hunted in the cinders\u2014I opened all my drawers\u2014no, no brooch. My\ndaughter came into my room and I told her my trouble. She hunted for it\nalso, and again looked into the cinders\u2014and found it !\nMiss Bell also writes to us : \"I did search the ashes in my mother's\nbedroom after her dream about her brooch.\"\nThe next case raises a somewhat curious point as to the relation of\nwhat I may call the subliminal gaze to defects of ordinary vision.\nP. 31<i.\nc\nFrom Mr. Herbert J. Lewis, 19, Park-place, Cardiff.\nIn September, 1880, 1 lost the landing order of a large steamer containing\na cargo of iron ore, which had arrived in the port of Cardiff. She had to\n\f390 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ncommence discharging at six o'clock the next morning. I received the landing1\norder at four o'clock in the afternoon, and when I arrived at the office at six\nI found that I had lost it. During all the evening I was doing my utmost to\nfind the officials of the Custom House to get a permit, as the loss was of the\ngreatest importance, preventing the ship from discharging. I came home in\na great degree of trouble about the matter, as I feared that I should lose my\nsituation in consequence.\nThat night I dreamed that I saw the lost landing order lying in a crack in\nthe wall under a desk in the Long Room of the Custom House.\nAt five the next morning I went down to the Custom House and got the\nkeeper to get up and open it. I went to the spot of which I had dreamed,\nand found the paper in the very place. The ship was not ready to discharge\nat her proper time, and I went on board at seven and delivered the landing\norder, saving her from all delay.\nHerbert J. Lewis.\nI can certify to the truth of the above statement.\nThomas Lewis.\n(Herbert Lewis' father),\nJuly Uth, 1884. H. Wallis.\nFrom E. J. Newell, George and Abbotsford Hotel, Melrose.\nAugust 1lth, 1884.\nI made some inquiries about Mr. Herbert Lewis' dream before I left\nCardiff. He had been searching throughout the room in which the order was\nfound. His theory as to how the order got in the place in which it was found,\nis that it was probably put there by someone (perhaps with malicious intent),\nas he does not see how it could have fallen so.\nThe fact that Mr. H. Lewis is exceedingly short-sighted adds to the\nprobability of the thing which you suggest, that the dream was simply an\nunconscious act of memory in sleep. On the other hand he does not believe\nit was there when he searched.\nE. J. Newtell.\nIs it conceivable here that the percipient's myopia may have inter\nfered less with his subliminal than with his supraliminal perception ; so\nthat the missing paper may thus have fallen within his visual field, but\nescaped his waking recognition 1 It is, again, in a discussion of somnam\nbulism that this point can be most fitly considered. It may suffice here\nto quote\u2014that my suggestion may not seem too fantastic\u2014a few lines\nfrom a personal observation of a somnambule by Dr. Dufay.i\n\" It is eight o'clock : several workwomen are busy around a table, on\nwhich a lamp is placed. Mdlle. R. L. directs and shares in the work,\nchatting cheerfully meantime. Suddenly a noise is heard : it is her\nhoad which has fallen sharply on the edge of the table. This is the\nbeginning of the access. She picks herself up in a few seconds, pulls\noff her spectacles with disgust, and continues the work which she had\ni Revue Scicntifiquc, 3? serie, XXXII., p. 1G7.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 391\nbegun ;\u2014having no further need of the concave glasses which a pro\nnounced myopia render needful to her in ordinary life ;\u2014and even\nplacing herself so that her work is less exposed to the light of the lamp.\"\n.\"Miss X.\" has had an experience where the title of a book quite unknown\nto her, which she had vainly endeavoured to read where it lay at some\ndistance from her, presented itself in the crystal. Nor can we in her\ncase suppose any such spasmodic alteration in ocular conditions as may\nperhaps occur in trance.\nThe percipient in my next case has had at least one other experience,\n\u2014of a kind hard to explain without invoking something like clairvoyance.\n(Proceedings, Vol. IV., p. 154, note.) The precise date of the dream\nhere given cannot now be recovered ; and although, as Mr. Gurney, to\nwhom the case was sent, has remarked, \" Even an absent person would\nbe struck by encountering so dangerous an implement in so unusual a\nposition,\" we should not be justified in claiming proof of clairvoyance\nfrom a narrative whose details must now be uncertain. The dream-\nincident of the severed toe may be regarded as a mere symbolical\nrendering of the fact that the knife was likely thus to injure anyone\nwho might walk down the stairs.\nP. 333.\nFrom Mrs. Wheeler, 106, High-street, Oxford. 1883.\nI dreamed I went down the back stairs at Hcston into the kitchen,\n.and as I stepped off the last step on to the floor, something severed my\nbig toe (without hurting me at all), and I saw it roll across the floor.\nThe next morning I went down those stairs before the kitchen shutters\nwere open, and with bare feet (I wanted some water), and just as I got\nto the last step I remembered my dream and looked carefully (I think I\ntook the shutter bar down and partly opened the shutter, but I do not\nfeel quite certain), and then saw a knife lying on its back on the floor\nwith the edge up, just where I should have put down my foot had I\nstepped off the bottom stair. I am not given to having vivid dreams\nparticularly.\nSomewhat the same caution must be observed in estimating the\nfollowing case. It comes from a gentleman whom we believe to be a\ncareful informant ; but it is a recollection of a schoolboy dream ; and\nwe cannot now be sure that a glimpse of the desired map may not have\nbeen unwittingly caught.\nM. 314.\nFrom Mr. Gervase Marson, Birk Crag, Great Clower-street, Higher\nBroughton, Manchester.\nWhen I was a boy, about 14 years of age, I was living with my parents\nas aforesaid. There came to the town one day a sort of travelling bazaar.\nThe proprietors of this bazaar lived in a large room in the principal hotel,\nfor the display of their wares, which consisted of workboxes, toys, chimney\nornaments, &c. As soon as the exhibition opened I went, at the request of\n\f392 Mr. F. W. H. Myers,\nmy sister, to inspect the same, being deputed by my sister to purchase for her a.\ndissecting map of Europe. I looked over the stalls very carefully, but could,\nsee no dissecting map at all. I then addressed myself to the female who was\npresiding over the shows, and told her what I wanted. She said she did not\nthink they had anything of the kind, but, to make sure, she would look.\nShe then looked carefully over all the stalls, and returned to tell me that\nthey had nothing of the kind I asked for in the place. I was very much\ndisappointed at this news, and returned home in quite a dejected state of\nmind. The next night I dreamed that I went again to the exhibition, and.\nafter a short search, found, up in a corner and hidden under other larger\narticles, the very thing I wanted. I dreamed the map in question was in a\nforeign language, that it was enclosed in a box having a glass lid, and that\nthe glass of the lid was cracked in a peculiar star-like manner. This dream\ninfluenced me so much that, as soon as I had finished my breakfast, I set oft\"\nagain for the exhibition-room. On entering it I walked straight to the\ncorner of the room indicated in my dream, and there found the exact article\nI had dreamed of. The map was in the French language, the box containing\nit had a glass lid, and the glass was cracked just as I had seen it in my\ndream. The mistress of the exhibition was as much astonished at the\u00bb\noccurrence as myself. I bought the map and took it home to my sister.\nG. Marson.\nIn the cases which I have thus far quoted the dream-self has\npresented a significant scene,\u2014has chosen, so to say, from its gallery of\nphotographs the special picture which the waking mind desired,\u2014but\nhas not needed to draw any more complex inference from the facts-\npresumably at its disposal. I have now to deal with a small group of\ndreams which reason as well as remember ;\u2014if indeed in some of them\nthere be not something more than mere reasoning on facts already in\nsome way acquired,\u2014something which overpasses the scheme prescribed\nfor the present chapter.\nIn the first place we cannot doubt that definite data already known\nmay sometimes be treated in somnambulism or ordinary dream with\nmore than waking intelligence. Such are the cases of mathematical\nproblems solved in somnambulism, or of the skeletal arrangement\ndiscovered by Agassiz in common sleep for scattered bones which had\nbaffled his waking skill. Mr. F. W. Hayes, an artist who does not\npay much attention to mathematics, contributes an interesting and\nrecent example of dream-capacity of this kind.\nM. 40.\n12, Westcroft-square., W., February 1st, 1892.\nEarly in January, 1892, I began to teach one of my children geometrical\ndrawing, using one of the shilling books on the subject. After arriving at\nProblems IV. and V., \" To draw a straight line perpendicidar to a given\nstraight line A B, from a given point C outside it: Case I., when the point is\nopposite, or nearly opposite, the middle of the line A B ; and, Case II., when\nthe point is opposite, or nearly opposite, the extremity of A B,\" I one night\ndreamt that I was looking over the diagrams of these problems in E. S_\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 393\nBurchett's standard work on Practical Geometry, Plate IV., and noticed\n(without any sense of novelty) that the right hand top corner of the plate\nwas occupied with a diagram relating to a third case, viz., \" When the point\nC is beyond A B.\"\nI recollect studying the clearness and neatness of the lines in the steel-\nplate engraving (the required line lying vertically opposite to the right hand\nend of the line A B, and about a quarter-inch away from it) as compared\nwith the coarser wood-cuts in the book I had used for teaching, and also\ncommented mentally on the unjustifiable omission of Case III. from the\nlatter merely to save space.\nAn evening or two afterwards, having Burchett's work in my hands\naccidentally, my dream recurred to mo. As I could not recollect the solution\nof Case III., while the diagram remained vividly in my mind's eye, I turned\nto Plate IV., and was completely taken by surprise to find no Case III. there\nat all. (It is not, I find, in any work known to me, or of which I can hear.)\nTurning my attention to the required solution of the hypothetical Case\nIII., it almost instantly occurred to mo as follows : From any two points in\nA B, as A and B, with radii A C and B C, describe arcs intersecting at C and\nD ; join C D. (The contingency of C lying in a prolongation of A B is met\nby an earlier problem.)\nAs this solution is the correct one (i.e., involving no anticipation of later\nproblems), it seems probable that its prompt occurrence to my mind was in\nreality a recollection of the working lines in the dream diagram, which I did\nnot in my dream consciously notice at all.\nIt may be noted that while the various given solutions of Cases I. and II.\ndo not apply to Case III., the above solution of Case III. is also a general\nmethod for the two others.\nP.S.\u2014The position on Plate IV. occupied by the dream diagram was not\nquite the proper one, being two places too early (Figure 4 instead of 6).\nF. W. Hayes.\nSince this was in print, Mr. Hayes has discovered the missing\ndemonstration in another text-book. \" It is thus not physically im\npossible,\" he says, \" for me to have seen the problem ; but, if so, the\nbook and the page must have been before me unconsciously ;\u2014I retain\nthe certain conviction that I never saw or thought of the matter before\nI dreamt it.\"\nAnother informant\u2014Mr. F. J. Jones, of 257,Uxbridge-road,'W.\u2014tells\nus that as an engineering student he once dreamt the answer, \" a number\nwith several places of decimals,\" to a problem which had baffled him over\nnight, apparently with no recollection of the process used in its solution.\nMrs. Verrall, already quoted, has also solved in dream a problem in the\nDifferential Calculus, which had baffled her during the day.\nCases of this sort seem closely akin-to the subliminal faculty which\nthe \"arithmetical prodigies\" whom we have already dwelt upon display\nin waking hours. After studying their performances one can hardly be\nsurprised at any amount of subliminal manipulation of fixed data. The\n2 D\n\f394 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ncase is a little different when the problem involves the mixed and\ncontingent facts of business experience. I will first quote a case where\nthe needed data had passed before the waking eyes, although it was\nleft for dream to interpret them fruitfully. The narrative was sent to\nDr. Elliotson, at first hand from a friend, by a physician well known in.\nhis day.\nM. 648.\nVol. VIII., Zoist, p. 328.\nInstance of clairvoyance during sleep. Communicated by Dr. Davey,\nof the Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum.\n\" My Dear ,\u2014In accordance with your request, I herewith transmit\nyou particulars, as they occurred, of the peculiar dream, if such it may be\ncalled, which proved of so essential service to me.\n\" As I mentioned to you, I had been bothered since September with an\nerror in my cash account for that month, and despite many hours' examina\ntion, it defied all my efforts, and I almost gave it up as a hopeless case. It\nhad been the subject of my waking thoughts for many nights, and had\noccupied a large portion of my leisure hours. Matters remained thus\nunsettled until the 11th December. On this night I had not, to my know\nledge, once thought of the subject, but I had not long been in bed, and\nasleep, when my brain was as busy with the books as though I had been at\nmy desk. The cash-book, banker's pass-books, &c., &c, appeared before\nme, and without any apparent trouble I almost immediately discovered the\ncause of the mistake, which had arisen out of a complicated cross-entry. I\nperfectly recollect having taken a slip of paper in my dream and made such a\nmemorandum as would enable me to correct the error at some leisure time ;\nand, having done this, that the whole of the circumstances had passed from\nmy mind When I awoke in the morning I had not the slightest recollection\nof my dream, nor did it once occur to me throughout the day, although I had\nthe very books before me on which I had apparently been engaged in my\nsleep. When I returned home in the afternoon, as I did early for the\npurpose of dressing, and proceeded to shave, I took up a piece of paper from\nmy dressing table to wipe my razor, and you may imagine my surprise at\nfinding thereon the very memorandum I fancied had been made during the\nprevious night. The effect on me was such that I returned to our office and\nturned to the cash-book, when I found that I had really, when asleep,\ndetected the error which I could not detect in my waking hours, and had\nactually jotted it down at the time.\n\" I have no recollection whatever as to where I obtained the writing\nmaterials, or rather paper and pencil, with which I made the memorandum\nreferred to. It certainly must have been written in the dark, and in my\nbedroom, as I found both paper and pencil there the following afternoon, and\ncould not for a long time understand anything about it. The pencil was not\none which I am in the habit of carrying, and my impression is that I must\nhave either found it accidentally in the room, or gone downstairs for it.\n\"Jamtary Uth, 1860. \" C.J.E.\n\" P.S.\u2014I may add that, on a former occasion, nearly a similar occurrence\ntook place ; with, however, this difference, that I awoke at the conclusion of\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 395\n-the dream, and was perfectly aware, when certainly awake, of having made\n-the memorandum at that time. This, however, was not the case in the\noccurrence I have above detailed. Should you be likely to print the above,\nplease let it appear with initials only, as although I would corroborate it to\nanyone wishing for a personal satisfaction by inquiry, I have no desire to see\nmy name in type ; it might also be prejudicial to me.\"1\nThe two cases of Mr. Peterson's which I shall next quote have\nsome resemblance to Dr. Davey's, although the percipient, who is a\nstrong believer in spiritual intercourse, would certainly not interpret\nthem in the same way. The length of time, however, which elapsed\nbetween the incidents and the record must be credited with its usual\neffect of blurring the accuracy of details ; and it is conceivable that\nsome clue, now forgotten, may have supplied the dream-self with a basis\non which to work.\nP. 335.\nFrom Mr. A. T. T. Peterson, Arnwood Towers, Lymington.\nFebruary 11th, 1884.\nI am deeply interested in coal mines in Bengal. Early in 1876 I was\nout there investigating matters connected with a large deficiency in the cash\naccount. There was no means of getting at the truth. One evening I-was\nsitting in an easy chair, a little before sunset, under the shade of a tree\nopposite the bungalow where I was staying and I fell fast asleep, my brain\nbeing full of perplexity as to which account was correct. In my sleep I\nfancied I heard someone say, \" Ask Baboo So and So.\" This name remained\non my memory when I awoke, and I put it down on paper. When my head\nconfidential native came to me an hour or two afterwards I asked who was\nBaboo So and So, and I was told that he had been in the service of\nseveral gentlemen named, during the previous 10 years, and was then the\nhead Baboo to a friend named. Some days after this I sent for the native,\nand managed to get information which led me to discover written evidence\nwhich satisfied my mind as to whose head the cap fitted.\nIn answer to inquiries, Mr. Peterson adds :\u2014\nIn answer to your remark as to the Baboo's name, I knew there was\nsuch a person, but I had neither seen nor heard of him for 10 years, and I\ndo not think I had ever spoke to him twice in my life. He was in no way\nconnected with the object I had in view, although he gave collateral evidence\nthat led to the object. A. T. T. P.\nP. 336.\nFebruary 11th, 1884.\nI can give you another very curious incident in a dream. In the year\n1861 or 1862, I was engaged in a very heavy equity suit between the repre\nsentatives of a deceased Indigo planter and his surviving partner. The\nsurviving partner wanted to show that the deceased partner at time of\ndeath was in debt to the partnership ; my contention was that he was creditor\nto a considerable amount. The accounts of the firm were all in the Bengalee\nlanguage. My clients were too poor to get translations by the official inter-\ni We have the gentleman's name and address.\u2014Zoitl.\n2 d 2\n\f396 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\npreters, which would have cost several thousand rupees ; the surviving\npartner claimed a portion and a profitable item in the account as belonging\nto him separately ; I claimed it for the partnership ; but no accounts were\nforthcoming to show which way the books showed it to be. There was\nsimply the vivd voce evidence of the defendant and his partisans. The Chief\nJustice repeatedly during the hearing remarked there must be some accounts\nsomewhere that would throw a light on the matter.\nI always spent my Saturday evening and Sunday and until Monday\nmorning at my country-house, 14 miles from Calcutta. One Sunday night,\nor rather early on Monday morning, whilst the hearing was still pending,\nI had a dream. I fancied I was arguing in the case, and I was addressing\nthe court and was saying \"That in answer to your lordship, as to whether\nthere was not anything in the accounts that would throw a light on the\nquestion as to whether this account was joint or separate, I had found\naccidentally an entry, although only for a small sum, 26 rupees, some annas,\nand some pice, at page so and so of such a year, which cleared up the\nmystery,\" begging to the court to send for the book and make the official\ninterpreter read it out, and I went on making strong remarks on the\ncharacter of the defendant ; when the opposite counsel got up and denounced\nme as a liar, on which I took a large lead inkstand and threw it at his head,\ncutting his head open, and laying him senseless on the floor of the court ;\nand the Chief Justice ordered me instantly into the custody of the court bailiff,\n\u2014when I awoke. This was a dream, about 2.30 a.m., Monday. I instantly\njumped out of bed, got a light, and put down on paper the heads of my dream,.\nI had my grooms roused up, my horses fed, and the relay sent on half way,\nand left for Calcutta a little after 4 and got there a little before 6, and sent\nfor the head native Baboo of the firm of solicitors in the case, told him to get\nthe head native in the master's office (if he could) to come at once and let him,\nin his presence, examine a particular book for a particular year, which he did,\nand to my surprise found the entry, and the sum at the page indicated by my\ndream. I need not say that I succeeded. Afterwards I told the story, when\nasked what led me to the accidental discovery ; and when I said \"a dream,\"\nI got well laughed at. A. T. T. P.\nIn answer to inquiries, Mr. Peterson says :\u2014\nMy head Baboo is dead, the counsel opposed to me is dead, the person to\nwhom the account book belonged is dead, and the chances are, as the concern\nto which the books belonged is broken up, that the white ants have eaten the\nbooks ; 22 years in Bengal destroys documents, unless specially guarded.\nIn these last cases the dream-intimation was of a kind to secure a\nwished-for end. In the following cases it averts an unthought-of evil.\nThe Rev. A. J. Macdonald, a careful collector of evidence, obtained\nfor us the following narrative,\u2014with the true names, which must be\nhere suppressed. \" The following,\" he says, \" I took down yesterday\nfrom the dictation of the Assistant Secretary of a Fire Insurance\nCompany.\"\nP.O. 600.\nApril 1st, 1884.\nLast year I dreamt that a certain cotton mill, insured in our company,\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 997\nwas burnt. The mill was one that I had never seen, nor was I acquainted\nwith any member of the firm ; and nothing to my recollection had been\nbefore me connected with the insurance for some years. On reaching the\noffice the following morning I turned up the surveyor's report, which I\nfound to bo rather meagre, and one that had been made some years before.\nI accordingly gave instructions to have the place re-inspected ; and when\nthis was done it was found that the mill was in an unsatisfactory\ncondition. Not being able to relieve ourselves during the current year\nfor any portion of the amount for which it was insured, we re-insured\nwith another office for part of the amount. A few months afterwards the\nmill was partially destroyed, our company saving through the action 1\ntook in consequence of the dream near upon a thousand pounds.\n[The true name of the secretary is signed, but is not for publication.]\nThe next case is from Colonel Reynolds, now of Cheltenham, who is\npersonally known to me, arid is an excellent witness.\nAbout the year 1870 I was in charge of a length of roadway, together with\nthe bridges large and small that carried it. Sometimes there were floods\nwhich endangered the bridges, and I was therefore always on the lookout to\nprevent serious damage which would have impeded the traffic. At the same\ntime this had been my daily life for so long that no anxiety remained in my\nmind about it. I regarded my duties as merely routine work. I was in a\nfairly good state of health. One night I dreamt in a most vivid manner that\nI saw an exact picture of a certain small bridge. All the surroundings were\n.complete and left no doubt as to which bridge it was. A voice at the same\nmoment said to me : \"Go and look at that bridge.\" This was said distinctly\nthree times. In the morning the dream still persisted in my mind and so\nimpressed me that I rode off at once about six miles to the bridge. Nothing\nwas to be seen out of the ordinary. The small stream was, however, coming\n.down in flood. On walking into the water I found to my astonishment that\nthe foundations of the bridge had been entirely undermined and washed\naway. It was a marvel that it was still standing. Of course the work neces\nsary to preserve the bridge was done. There is no doubt that but for the\ndream the bridge would have fallen, as there was no reason whatever to attract\nmy attention specially to this bridge. Though small, the bridge was an\nimportant one, as its situation was peculiar. The picture that was dreamt\nwas so strong that it is even now fixed in my mind as plainly almost as it was\nthen. I have no doubt whatever that a special warning was given me by a\nhigher intelligence. I have never at any time had any other similar experience.\nCheltenham. H. C. Reynolds.\nDecember 13th, 1891.\n^Now in each of these cases we are dealing with the anxieties of a\nconscientious man, deeply concerned in the safety of a particular struc\nture. In neither instance, however, was any cause for apprehension\nobvious to the supraliminal self.\nAs a pendant to these two cases where a motionless and inanimate\ndanger was discerned, I will quote two cases where an active scene\u2014of\na nature which the sleeper was especially concerned to prevent\u2014seems\n\f398 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nto have been witnessed in dream.i The introduction of living persons at\nthe other end of the chain suggests telepathy as a possible explanation ;\nand indeed the cases which remain to be cited in this chapter are\navowedly introduced as a transition from mere hyperesthesia and\nhypermnesia to the indications of supernormal powers with which we\nshall hereafter have to deal.\nL. 619. 1884.\nMr. Francis Alvey Darwin, of Creskeld Hall, Pool, Leeds, sends us the\nfollowing narrative, taken down by him from the lips of William Myers,\nbailiffand ex-keeper on the Creskeld estate, and Elizabeth his wife, both of\nwhom sign the account.\nSome years ago, I was asleep in bed here about 12 to 1 a.m., and dreamt\nthat I was out watching in a certain place where two gates face each other,\nnear my house ; that four poachers came up to me through those gates and\nthat I seized hold of two of them, one m each hand, and shook them and\nstruggled with them, at the same time shouting for assistance. My cries,\nand struggles awoke my wife, who woke me up ; at once I told her what my\ndream had been, and that I had had a hard fight. Just about that very\ntime, and at the very place I saw in my dream, four poachers did make their\nappearance and stoned some of our men who were watching there.\nWhen they came to see me in the morning, before I had had any conversa\ntion with anyone, I told them at once I knew all about it, describing to\nthem in presence of my wife both the number of men and the place where\nthey had come across them.\nMy wife will corroborate all I say as to my cries and struggles, of which\nI myself was quite unconscious till she woke me. We thought it a curious,\ndream at the time.\n(Signed) William Myers.\nElizabeth Myers.\n3, Pump-court, Temple, E.C., March Uth, 1884.\nDear Sir,\u2014In answer to your letter of the 10th inst., I have no doubt\nthat the place near the gates referred to was a place which he knew perfectly\nwell that poachers would be almost sure to pass in order to set a certain\nwood. I do not think that the place was ever regularly watched, as there is\nno cover to hide any men in, but the gates would certainly be frequently\nmarked in order that it might be ascertained if anyone had gone through\nthem or not.\u2014-Yours truly, Francis Alvey Darwin.\nBefore dismissing this dream as a mere accidental coincidence, the\nreader should refer to Dr. A. K. Young's case (Phantasms of the Living,\nVol. I., p. 381), where the dreamer strikes out violently at imaginary\nfoes,\u2014in a scene where an assault is being actually committed upon a\ntenant of his own.\ni A transitional case, where an object which had been purposely concealed was\ndiscovered by a sudden impression, was sent to me in 18N7 by the well-known,\nsurgeon, Dr. Whitehead, of 24, St. Ann's-gquare, Manchester. The impression was\nreceived in waking hours, and not in dream, but seemed to depend upon no external\nindication whatever.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 399\nIn the next case there is no suggestion of matter on which the\ndream-self could have worked, except the fact that on the previous\nevening the dreamer had heard a cart rapidly driven.\nL. 841.\nTurnours Hall, nr. Chigwell, Essex, July, 1888.\nStatement by William Bass, farm bailiff to Mrs. Palmer :\u2014\nOn the night of Good Friday, 1884, I went to bed at half past 10, and\nvery soon fell asleep. Just before the clock struck one I awoke in violent\nagitation and profuse perspiration. I told my wife I dreamt that something\nwas wrong at the farm stables, and I was so convinced it was the fact that\nI should get up at once and go there. She persuaded me to lie down again\n(I was sitting up in bed and the night was cold). Still I could not rest. At\na quarter to two I dressed hastily, and taking a lamp and matches with me\nwent as fast as I could to the stables (distant about a third of a mile). I at\nonce perceived the place had been broken into and that a grey mare had been\nstolen. From appearances where the mare had lain I judged she had been\ntaken away about two hours previously.\nWilliam Bass.\nMr. J. B. Surgey, enclosing this account, writes as follows :\u2014\n22, Holland-street, Kensington, July 9th, 1888.\nDear Mr. Myers,\u2014Probably a few lines will be acceptable to you\nbeyond those to which William Bass has signed his name. Before being\nemployed as bailiff he was coachman at Turnours Hall, and has been 32\nyears in his place\u2014a thoroughly trustworthy, straightforward, and the most\nunimaginative, matter-of-fact fellow conceivable. Before his dream of Good\nFriday, 1884, he was never known to speak of one. I had all particulars of\nit almost immediately, but only jotted them down last week. I asked if he\ncould guess how long he had been dreaming when he awoke. No, not\npossible to guess ; but he was in a horrible fright and his shirt was\n\"dripping \" with perspiration, by which he supposed he might have been in\na state of excitement a good while.\u2014Very truly yours,\nJ. B. Surgey.\nMr. Bass has since been interviewed by Mr. Barkworth, who\u2022\nwrites :\u2014\nApril 18th, 1890.\nWilliam Bass confirmed his previous evidence to mo this day.\nAbout the time when the incident occurred (and for a long while after\nwards) systematic horse-stealing had gone on in the neighbourhood, but Bass\nhas no recollection of being specially anxious about this. Pressed as to the\ndetails of the dream, he recollected that he saw the horses in the dream, and\nhad a vivid impression of \"something wrong,\" but what it was he did not\nknow. Although thus vague, the impression was so strong as to bo irresis\ntible, so that although his wife begged him to go to sleep again, he lay awake\nfor about 1| hours until he could bear it no longer, when he got up and went\nto the stable.\nHis wife confirmed all this, particularly as to his having twice said there\nwas something wrong in the stable and he must go and see to it. He had\n\f400 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nalways reproached her since with having prevented his going to the stable\nwhen he first woke. Bass states he is not in the habit of dreaming.\nPressed as to any previous experience of the kind, he said that about 20\nyears ago he dreamt he saw his father dead. The father, who was quite\nwell at the time, died suddenly 10 days afterwards.\nOn the evening before the horse was stolen he had heard a cart driven\nby very fast. The neighbourhood is so lonely that anything unusual is\nremarked upon, and he said to his wife, \"There is something wrong.\" He\nhad made the same remark on previous occasions when a vehicle was driven\nrapidly by.\nWhen he interviewed the police in Scotland Yard, they asked him how\nhe knew the horse had been stolen in the middle of the night, and when he\ntold his dream they ridiculed him, and evidently suspected complicity on his\npart. Mr. Bass is a most respectable man, well known and esteemed in the\nparish. He has lived in his present situation for many years.\nI will conclude with two visions not easy to class, but apparently well\nattested. Mr. Brighten is known to Mr. Podmore,\u2014who concurs in what\nappears to be the estimate generally formed of that gentleman, namely,\nthat he is a shrewd, unimaginative, practical man.\nP. 117.\nI owned a 35 ton schooner, and in August, 1876, in very calm weather,\nI dropped anchor in the Thames at the North shore, opposite Gravesend,\nas it was impossible to get to the other side, there being no wind.\nThe current being exceedingly swift at that part we let out plenty of\nchain cable before going to bed. I had captain and crew of 3 men on\nboard, besides visitors. Towards morning I found myself lying awake in\nmy (owner's) cabin with the words ringing in my ears, \" Wake, awake,\nyou'll be run down.\" I waited a few moments, then dropped off to sleep,\nbut was again awakened by the same words ringing in my ears. Upon\nthis I leisurely put on some clothes and went on deck and found the tide\nrushing past very swiftly, and that wo were enveloped in a dense fog, and\nall was calm and quiet in the early morning, and there was already some\ndaylight. I paced the deck once or twice, then went below, undressed,\ngot into my berth, and fell asleep, only to be again awakened by the same\nwords. I then somewhat more hastily dressed, went on deck, and climbed\nsome way up the rigging to get above the fog, and was soon in a bright,\nclear atmosphere with the fog like a sea at my feet, when looking round\nI saw a large vessel bearing down directly upon us. I fell, rather than\nscrambled, out of the rigging, rushed to the forecastle, shouted to the\ncaptain who rushed on deck, explained all in a word or two, he ran to\nthe tiller, unlashod it, put it hard a port, the swift current acting upon\nthe rudder caused the boat to slew across and upward in the current,\nwhen on came the large vessel passing our side, and it would have cleared\nus but her anchor which she was carrying (having lifted it in consequence\nof having heaved anchor at low tide with very little cable) caught in our\nchain when she swung round and came alongside, fortunately, however,\ndoing us very little damage. I at once jumped on her deck and woke up\nsome men who appeared on deck in various stages of intoxication, who\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 401\nstupidly wanted to remain as they were, but by dint of coaxing and\nthreatening in turn I induced them to take some turns at their capstan,\nwhich had the effect of freeing their anchor from my chain, and she soon\nleft us and dropped her anchor a little lower down. I at once narrated\nthe above facts to the captain, and next day informed my visitors of the\nvoice to which we all owed our preservation. I cannot think that it was\nreally a human voice, as in consequence of the fog no one could have\nseen the relative position of the vessels, and no other vessels were near\nus within half a mile or more. My visitors at once desired me to return\nto Greenhithe, and discontinued their trip.\nArgyle House, Southend-on-Sea. Wm. E. Brighten.\nDecember 6th, 1884.\nI was one of the visitors on the occasion above referred to, and Mr.\nBrighten related the occurrence to us on the following day.\nRobert Parker.\n31, Liverpool-street, London, Solicitor.\nP. 118.\nI was serving my articles to a solicitor in the city of Norwich at the time\nof the following dream, and although it happened in March of the year 1861\nit is as fresh and vivid in my memory as if it happened yesterday, and I have\nfrequently narrated it. In that year Mr. C. (also an articled clerk), having\npurchased a long paddle steamer for river use (of a class since supplanted\nby the launches of the present day), arranged with me that we should have a\nweek's holiday in the steamboat, so putting our provisions on board, we\n(perhaps rashly) started without any engineer or attendant of any kind. Our\ntrip was a pleasant one from Norwich to Yarmouth, and we proceeded up the\nNorth River, i.e., River Bure, as far as Acle, returning that night to the\nNorth Quay, Great Yarmouth, where we were conveniently moored stem and\nstern to a wherry (i.e., the local name for barges conveying goods) and we\nturned in about 9.30 p.m. The cabin was comfortable and we were able to\nenjoy our beds as at home, and I must describe the doors as two small\nfolding doors secured by shutting from the inside against the threshold, and\nat the top by a hatch coming over and secured with bar top and bottom. I\nmust have slept some hours before my dream commenced. I thought my\neyes opened, and that the top of the cabin had become transparent, and I\ncould see two dark figures floating in the air about the funnel. They\nappeared to be in earnest converse, pointing towards the mouth of the river,\nand then at the ropes by which the boat was moored ; at last they turned to\neach other, and after some gestures they seemed to have resolved upon a\nplan of action, and each floated in the air, one to the stem and the other to\nthe stern, holding out a forefinger, and at the same moment each forefinger\ntouched a rope and instantly burned it like a red-hot iron. The boat\nthus freed at once drifted with the rapid ebb, first past the quay under\nthe suspension bridge, then under the iron bridge, then across the broad\nwaters of Braydon towards Yarmouth bridge, then down between the long\nlines of shipping there. All this time the two figures were floating in the\nair above the boat, and both giving forth musical sounds. I thought I tried\nto break the spell upon me and wake my companion, for I knew that if we\n\f402 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ndrifted out to sea we should certainly be swamped crossing the bar, but I lay-\nthere helpless. My eyes apparently saw every familiar object along the two\nand a-half miles to the sea. At last we passed Southtown, then the village\nof Gorleston, and we came to the sharp last turn of the river where the swift\nwaters were hurrying and tumbling over the bar to the broad sea beyond ;\nand in those waters we were soon whirling, when the musical sounds, which\nhad never ceased, were exchanged by the two dark figures for hideous screantR\nof triumph as the boat rapidly began to sink. At last the waters appeared\nto reach my mouth, and I was drowning, choking. With a wild effort I\nbounded from the couch, burst the doors outwards, shivering them to pieces,\nand found myself (in my night-clothes) awake outside the ruined doors on a\ncalm, bright moonlight night, and instinctively turned to the head rope ; to\nmy horror, it had just parted. Turning for the boathook I saw beside me\nmy friend C, who had been aroused by the crash, and he shouted that he\nsaw the stern rope go at the same time. We both held on despairingly to\nthe boathook, bruising our unprotected shins, but our cries woke up the\nwherryman, who came to our assistance, supplying fresh ropes, and we were\nmade snug for the rest of the night. My friend upbraided me for the wreck\nof his doors, and I at once told him the whole of the above dream, by which\nI was then very much excited. Next day I could calmly reflect that had we\nremained asleep when the ropes parted the tragedy I dreamed of must\ninevitably have taken place in all its literal detail.\nWilliam E. Brighter.\nArgyle House, Southend, Essex.\n1884.\nWitness, Mr. J. W. Clabburn, Guild House, Thorpe, Norwich, states :\u2014\nI was with Mr. Brighten on the occasion referred to, and my knowledge of\nthe matter commenced with being awakened by the crash of the doors, upon\nwhich I went out and saw Mr. Brighten with the boathook, in an excited\nstate, trying to hold the bows of the boat. I saw the stern rope part, the\nbow rope had already gone. The whole scene passed in a moment. Mr.\nBrighten at once related his dream to me as above.\n1884. James W. Clabburn.\nEach experience is unique, and I have never had any other dream or\nvoice warning of impending danger.\nNeither am I a dreamer at all beyond the ordinary run of mankind.\nI can have no possible objection to have my name appended to the\nstatements.\nArgyle House, Southend. William E. Brighten.\nDecember 6th, 1884.\nFew of our narratives are more difficult than these to range under\nany one of our definite classes. In some way Mr. Brighten obtained a\nconrmissance superieure, as M. Iiichet terms it ;\u2014in some way he be\ncame aware of impending dangers which no ordinary faculty could have\nrevealed. Are we to call it clairvoyance? or premonition? or com\nmunication from any embodied or unembodied mind ?\nI should not be frank if I were to leave the impression that in any\nof these cases I regard the explanation which seems to lie nearest to our\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 403\nexisting knowledge as necessarily the true one. Such an explanation\nshould be the first suggested ; and should be pressed as far as it will\ngo. But we cannot philosophically sever one group of these new and\nstrange phenomena from other groups newer to Science and stranger\nstill. Much has already been published in these Proceedings which\nmay well remind us that the most familiar things are not therefore the\nsimplest ; that what for us is supernormal may for a wider purview be\nthe norm itself ; that what to us seem widest generalisations may\nbe but the special incidents of some remoter law. All our classifica\ntions must needs be provisional in the absence of any true knowledge\nas to the mode of operation, the mutual interrelations, of powers which\nwe are just learning to detect, just endeavouring to define. If it is, as\nwe know, impossible to describe the senses, say, of insects in terms of\nour own senses;\u2014if we are obliged in dealing even with faculties\nbeneath our own to make use of remote and perhaps misleading analogies\nin order to get any nomenclature which shall be at all intelligible,\u2014\nhow much more shall we be perplexed, when we deal with faculties\nabove our own, to classify them in any way except as the counterparts,\nor extensions of the limited and specialised faculties which our terrene\nlife commands !\nWe know, for instance, that thoughts are conveyed from one mind\nto another by certain familiar channels. When we learn that thoughts\nare also conveyed by other and unknown channels, we set that group of\nphenomena apart, and call it telepathy. We know that we discern the\nfacts around us, within certain limits, by sight and hearing. When\nour perception seems to pass beyond those limits, we set apart that\ngroup of phenomena, and call them clairvoyance or lucidity. We\nknow that we can to a certain extent infer from the present both the\nnear future and the recent past. If we learn that the future is some\ntimes foreseen in a manner which no ordinary inferences will explain,\nwe set apart that fact as prevision ;\u2014or, as I should prefer to say,\nprecognition. And similarly,\u2014-although the conception has hardly as\nyet been isolated, nor has received a name,\u2014we must needs set apart\nsuch knowledge of the past as no ordinary retrogressive inferences will\nexplain under some such title as retrocognition.\nBut while thus inevitably arranging these ultra-terrene powers with\nreference to terrene conceptions, we must beware of assuming that such\npowers are differentiated from each other by any such limit or variety of\nfunction as exists for terrene nerves and brains. Our human eye collects,\ninto a single prospect the scene which the insectviews seatteringlythrough\na hundred facets ; and thus, too, in realms of higher law, the distinction\nbetween all our adits of knowledge may be merged in some simple\nintuition. Men have learnt long since that the Universal Mind does\nnot sniff up the smoke of sacrifices, nor gaze from Olympus on the\n\fMr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfortunes of a single fray. Our newer speculations bring home to us\nafresh the thought that to such a Mind all knowledge must arrive with\nequal immediacy, and that Past and Future must be included in\none eternal Now. If we endeavour to represent the World-soul to our\nselves, we must imagine one of its aspects (as I have elsewhere urged)\nas a World-record ;\u2014a transcript of each cosmic moment so complete\nand living that the remotest past is there more real than is to our dim\nperception the current and actual hour. Is man then cognisant of his\nown history? Are the annals of his separate individuality imprinted\nwithout him or within 1 Does he come to them hereafter like .\/93neas\nat the Carthaginian shrine,\u2014discovering in an unknown land the image\nof his own environment and the symbol of his own fate 1\nSe quoque principibus permixtum adgnovit Achivis,\nEoasque acies, et nigri Memnonis arma.\nOr do his long-past actions stand about him in his soul's presence-\nchamber,\u2014ever changeless but ever living,\u2014like the golden watch\ndogs in Alcinous' palace-hall which Hephestus fashioned with cunning\nheart 1 There is significance, there is dignity, in even the pettiest\nincidents which seem to link man's secret memory with this chronicle\nof imperishable things. Poor and brief is all the life he knows ; but\nyet some chapter of that cosmic record is writing itself unceasingly\nwithin the bounds of his being ;\u2014however perishing or however per\ndurable those walls of Mansoul may be.\n\fFurther Information, &c. 405\nV.\nFURTHER INFORMATION AS TO DR. BACKMAN'S\nEXPERIMENTS IN CLAIRVOYANCE.\nWe have received various items of information with regard to the\ncases of clairvoyance reported by Dr. Backman in Proceedings, Vol.\nVII. (Part XIX.), p. 199, sqq., which we will here give under separate\nheadings. The most important of these items is a certified trans\nlation of an account by the Director-General of Pilotage, Mr. Ankar-\nkrona, of the seance of September 21st, 1888, described at page 205.\nThis account, which is dated January 28th, 1889, is the first written\nrecord which we possess of that seance ; and it will be seen that it on\nthe whole confirms, and considerably enlarges, Baron von Rosen's later\naccount. The English of this and other certified translations mentioned\nbelow, although quite clear and intelligible, is defective in grammar\nand diction. We have corrected the language ; but the originals of\nthe translations, and of Mr. Wicksell's paper mentioned below, are\npreserved in our archives for reference if necessary.\nI. Account by Mr. Ankarkrona of Alma RAdberg's Clairvoyance.\nAt the end of last September I made a tour along the coast of Westervik\non H.M. service, to inspect some newly built lighthouses there. At\nOskarshaum I went on board the pilot-steamer Kalmar. Besides the crew,\nthere were present on board the Captain of Pilotage Baron von Rosen, the\nBaroness, and a young woman in his service, named Alma. On the coast of\nWestervik we met with the Captain of Pilotage Mr. Smith, from Norrkoping.\nOn the evening of September 21st we were lying at anchor in the Kalmar in\na creek on the coast. Knowing Alma to be an uncommon \"medium,\" I\nasked her if Baron von Rosen might hypnotise her. \" Yes, with pleasure,\nas soon as I have washed up the china,\" she replied. I had already spoken\nto Baron von Rosen. Soon after ten Alma went down into the cabin and\ndeclared herself ready. Baron von Rosen sent her to sleep, and I then\nasked him to ask her whether she would like to go to my house at Stockholm.,\ngive a description of it, and see what the inmates were doing. \" I never\ntried such an experiment before, but I will try it,\" the Baron replied. And\nso the experiment proceeded in about the following manner [Baron von\nRosen asking the questions].\nBaron von Rosen : Will Alma go to the house of the Commander\nAnkarkrona at Stockholm and see how it is there ? Alma : Yes (her voice\nwas feeble and as it were hissed out). Q. : Is Alma there ? A. : Yes. Q. *\nWhat do you see ? A. : A small room with very, very dark tapestries with\n\f406 Further Information as to Dr. Bookman's\ngold on the walls. Q. : How many windows ? A. : One. Q. : What else do\nyou see ? A. : Two paintings ;\u2014one a landscape, the other a marine scene.\nSeveral other pictures. In one corner a bookshelf ; in another a bouquet,\nbut not of flowers. On one wall a portrait of a lady, in oils. On the floor\na carpet, not covering the whole floor ; on the carpet a table ; on the table a\nlamp ; by the table a chair, on which Mrs. Ankarkrona is sitting. Q. :\nWhat is she doing ? A. : She is looking at a newspaper. Q. : What news\npaper ? A. : Dagbladet. [The name commonly given to the Stockholmu\nDagblad.\u2014A. Backman.] (I said, I do not take the Dagbladet.) Q. : You\nmust look better for the name. What newspaper is it ? A. : Svenska. (I\ntake the Srenska Dagbladet.) Q. : How is Mrs. A. dressed ? A. : In black,\nwith the bodice brocaded [faconne].\nQ. : Can you go into the drawing-room ? A. : Yes. Q. : How many\nwindows are there 1 A. : Three. Q. : What more do you see? A. : Plenty\nof furniture ; two chaises longuts, such as I never saw before. Two large\ntables and several small ones. Great brown draperies for the doors, of the\nsame stuff as that which covers the furniture. The window curtains are\ndouble, with broad lace. On the tables and everywhere are bibelots. Easels\nwith portraits of ladies and gentlemen. A number of plants ; several made\nof paper. A magnificent chandelier. On the wall a large landscape. On\none wall a peculiar drapery of plush with a broad golden cornice. Every\nwhere small pieces of plate, with something written on them ;\u2014I cannot say\nwhat. Two very beautiful vases. Q. : (At my suggestion von Rosen asked),\nIs not the chandelier covered with stuff ? A. : No. (When I left Stockholm\nthe chandelier had been covered ; but the cover had been removed on the\nsame day.) Q. : What have they been doing [in the house] to-day? A. :\nSweeping ! (The furniture had been taken out and beaten.)\nQ. : Where has Mrs. A. been to-day ? A. : Out of the house. Q. : Can\nyou go into the kitchen ? A. : Yes. Q. : How are you coming into it ? A. :\nNow I am going through a dining-room ; now through a long narrow passage,\nwhich is a service-room ; now I am in the kitchen. Q. : What do you see\nthere ? A. : Two maidservants ; one older, one younger. The elder one is\nstanding by the fireplace. The younger one is sitting on a chair with some\nneedlework. This one I have seen before. Q. : Can you go to the place\nwhere Mrs. A. has been to-day ? You must go out by the lobby. A. : Yes.\nQ. : How does the lobby look ? A. : Long, narrow, and dark ; on the floor\na thick carpet, covering about half the floor ; a lamp in a glass case is\nhanging from the ceUing. Q. : Is Alma there now ? A. : Yes. Q. : Was\nthe way long ? A. : Not very. (The houses are in the same street.) Q. :\nWhat do you see ? A. : A gentleman, a lady, and a baby about two months\nold. I have seen the lady before. Q. : What is she like ? A. : She is dark,\nwith brown eyes. Q. : And the gentleman ? A.: He is fair. (Grey-haired.)\nQ. : What is the gentleman ? A. : I cannot see. Q. : Look in the ward\nrobe ? A. : An officer. Q. : What is the lady doing ? A. : She is sitting\non a chair, with the child on her knees. Q. : Is she suckling it ? A. : No,\nshe only looks at it. On the floor is standing an old maidservant. (A nurse\narrived that same day, or a few days before.) Q. : What is the name of the\nlady ? A. : I do not remember.\nQ. : Will you go to Norrkoping and see what it is like at Captain Smith's ?\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 407\nA. : No. Q. : Pray do so ; Captain Smith wishes it. A. : Yes. Q. : Is Alma\nthere 1 A. : Yes. Q. : What do you see ? A. : A lady and a little child. The\nchild is ill ; but it is nothing dangerous. There are two bedsteads for children\nin this room. (The child was ill before Mr. Smith left Norrkoping.)\nWhen Alma had slept calmly a little time she was awakened, and then\nremembered everythingperfectly. About ten days afterwards she completed\nher account to the Baroness von Rosen, who took notes of it. When she\nawoke she rubbed her arm, and when we asked her why she did so, she\nanswered that she had been sleeping so deeply that the arm had grown numb.\nAsked where she had seen the younger maidservant, she replied : \" I saw\nher this summer from the Kalmar thorough a telescope\u2014she was standing\non the pilot-steamer Ring.\" (She had in fact been housemaid on the Bing.)\nWhile we were talking and wondering over what had just passed, we men\ntioned the name Rosenblad.

In Proceedings, Vol. VII., p. 201, an account is given of the\nfirst occasion on which clairvoyance was shown by Anna Samuelsson.\nShe then saw, apparently in Mrs. Backman's house, a young girl whom\nDr. Backman recognised from the description as Miss H. W. After\nseeing this young lady, the clairvoyant saw Mrs. Backman go to a\nshop and buy something. Mrs. B. had in fact spoken by telephone\nwith Miss H. W. and then gone to a shop. So Dr. B. informed us ;\nbut he could not at the time find any contemporary letter. He has\nnow found a letter of Mrs. Backman's (the second which she wrote on\nthe subject), dated Dorby, June 19th, 1888, from which he quotes\nthe following extracts: \"I went out at 11.30 to buy something at\nLofberg's. ... A few moments before I had talked with H. W. by\ntelephone.\"\n\f408 Further Information as to Dr. Backman's\nIII. Another occurrence about which Dr. Backman has obtained\nfurther eiidence is the finding of the body of a drowned man through\nAnna Samuelsson (see Proceedings, Vol. VII., pp. 203-4). This was\nreported by Dr. Backman from his recollection of what Anna had told\nhim and of an account in a newspaper. He has tried to find this\nnewspaper, but without success. He has, however, obtained the\nfollowing written testimony from Anna herself, and, through her, from\ntwo men who were concerned in the finding of the body.\nHultsfred, February 17th, 1892.\n. . it has taken some time, because I wished that the persons who\nassisted in recovering the body should certify what they themselves knew to\nbe true, and if you wish for further information about this case, the young\nman's father will tell you more about it from the beginning, and I can only\nsay what is true about what I myself saw and witnessed, and you, Mr. Doctor,\nknow that I continually see in a direction opposite to the reality, and so it\nhappened in this case that he lay to the left and I saw him to the right . . .\n(Signed) Anna Samuelsson.\nThat in a trial made by Anna Samuelsson, being in hypnotic trance, to\npoint out the place where the body of the young man Samuelsson, drowned\nin 1890, lay, a place was pointed out by Anna, who added that tho\ndead body would be in the mid-stream, where it really was found. The\nnumber of feet we cannot give, as there was no question of that. Anna\nwas at her house when the sleep was induced ; she saw him to her right, but\nhe was found in the contrary direction, to the left. This we the undersigned\nhereby certify on our honour and conscience.\nHultsfred, February 16th, 1892.\n(Signed) C. O. Swensson. F. L. Pettersson.\nThat the above two papers are translated exactly according to the\noriginals, which were shown to me, I hereby certify.\nKalmar, March 10th, 1892.\nEx-officio.\nOSKar MkLLIn,\nNot. Public.\nDr. Backman adds the following note :\u2014\nIt may be remarked that the lake is very large and that there is in.\nreality only one place where there is a mid-stream, viz., where the stream\nflows into the lake, where the body was found.\nIV. Mr. Knut Wicksell, of Stockholm, has forwarded to us a long\ncriticism on Dr. Backman's experiments, which practically consists of\nthree lines of argument, as follows : (1) Mr. Wicksell points out obvious\ndefects in the record of some of these experiments,\u2014defects of the kind\nat once admitted by Dr. Backman in the first paragraph of his\noriginal paper (Proceedings, Vol. VII., p. 199). (2) He suggests some\nways in which the clairvoyants might have obtained knowledge of the\nfacts which their communications contained by ordinary means.\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 409\nTo the particular suggestions made by Mr. Wicksell, Dr. Backman\nhas sent us what seem to us satisfactory replies ;\u2014as, for instance, ti>\nthe suggestion that Alma Rildberg had learnt the facts as to Mr.\nAnkarkrona's and Captain Smith's households from members of their\nsteamers' crew (p. 206) Dr. Backman answers that Mr. Ankarkrona's\nsteamer was not at Krakelund at all, and that Captain Smith's steamer\nwas anchored so far from Captain von Rosen's (on which the experi\nments were made) that communication was only possible by shouting.\nA more important suggestion relates to an incident recorded on p. 205\nof Proceedings, Vol. VII. Mr. Wicksell remarks that if Alma \" knew\nthat Captain O. had sent a trunk containing clothes to his\nmother-in-law ['s house] and enclosed the key in a letter, she might\nperhaps, without the faculty either of clairvoyance or even thought-\nreading, have been able to guess that that letter ' spoke about clothes.'\n. . . To judge from the expressions in the Proceedings, it seems\nas if Captain O. was at the time staying with Alma's master, and\nif this be so, it would indeed be wonderful if she had not known any\nthing about the trunk.\" To this Dr. Backman replies that Captain O.\nwas living at the other end of the town, and that he no doubt selected\nthe question as one respecting which neither Dr. Backman nor Alma\ncould have any information. It is desirable, of course, that all\nsuch points should be carefully thought of, and mentioned in the\ncontemporary accounts of experiments.\nV. (3) In the third place, Mr. Wicksell describes letters to himself\nfrom Captain Braun and Lieutenant Hage'us which at first sight\nimpugn the accuracy of two of Dr. Backman's reports. In the second\ninstance at least, however, the discrepancy almost certainly resolves\nitself into a not unnatural confusion of memory. Captain Braun's\nobjection is to the experiment of predicting lottery tickets (p. 203).\nHe himself drew the numbers on this occasion, but it is not easy to\ndiscover exactly what he recollects, as he has sent no reply to a letter\nfrom Dr. Backman, and the words which Mr. Wicksell quotes from\nhim are somewhat vague : \" I don't remember the exact numbers\ndrawn, but I remember that Dr. Backman afterwards tried to advocate\nhis cause, saying, for instance, that the sum of the figures in the drawn\nNo. 18 was the same as the predicted No. 9, or that the predicted 4 or\n8 was contained in the drawn No. 48 or 84 ! \"\nIn reply, Dr. Backman transcribes a letter from the officer who won\non the No. 18 (who does not wish his name published), and two letters\nfrom other officers of the group, but not present at the drawing. It\nappears that no one now retains any independent recollection of what\nthe first of the drawn numbers was. There is therefore nothing to\noverthrow, though nothing to confirm, Dr. Backman's recollection of\n2 k\n\f410 Further Information cm to Br. Bookman's\nthe report (p. 203) made to him at the time that it was 4. All the\nthree officers who write to Dr. Backman agree that the second number\nwas 18. As to Captain Braun's impression that it was only after the\ndrawing of the numbers that Dr. Backman said that the clairvoyant's\nprediction of \"9\" might mean 9 or 18, we have one man's memory\nagainst another's. Dr. Backman's recollection is that he said it before\nthe drawing ; and as he tells us that he took pains to look into the\nmatter at the time, lest (not having been present at the drawing) he\nmight have been made the victim of a practical joke, his memory is\nperhaps the more likely to be right of the two. The question is, of\ncourse, a fundamental one for this incident, and we have here an illus\ntration of the great importance, now fully admitted by Dr. Backman,\nof recording observations and experiments at the time.\nVI. The second letter quoted by Mr. Wicksell is from Lieutenant\nHageus, one of the signatories to a report (p. 202) of a sitting where,\namongst other matter, Anna Samuelsson is described as truly declaring\nthat the number of coins in Quarter-master Ericsson's pocket is five.\n\" Lieutenant Hageus,\" says Mr. Wicksell, \" in a letter to me for another\npurpose, chanced to speak also about this experiment, and his version\n{wonderful to say) was different from the account given in Dr. Back-\nman's paper, and signed by Lieutenant H. himself, among others. ' I\nespecially remember,' he writes, ' when Anna was asked how many coins\nthe Quarter-master Ericsson had in his purse ; to which she answered\n(as far as I remember) \"seven.\" On searching it was found that the purse\ncontained only six ; but as she stuck to her assertion, one more search\nwas made ; when, besides the six coins, a trousers button was also\nfound, which completed the number.'\n\" This, no doubt,\" continues Mr. Wicksell, \" is the very experiment\ndescribed in Dr. Backman's paper, although the number of coins is\nthere differently given ; and as it is most improbable that the detail\nstated by Lieutenant Hag6us is the result of a lack of memory, no other\nexplanation is left but that he and three other persons (no doubt in good\nfaith) signed with their names an account which, as they all knew, was\ninexact in at least one important point.\"\nIt is not easy to see how Lieutenant Hageus and other gentlemen\ncould have signed, as Mr. Wicksell suggests, \" in good faith \" an account\nwhich they knew to be inexact. There is, however, as Dr. Backman's\nreply shows, no reason whatever to charge these gentlemen with either\nvoluntary or involuntary inaccuracy ; as the experiment now described\nby Lieutenant Hageus was made, as will be seen, on a different\noccasion, and no account of it has yet been published. \" The notes in\nquestion,\" says Dr. Backman, \" were written down by me immediately\nafter the experiment, were copied by a lawyer, and were read by me to\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 411\n\u2022the four persons and signed by them on the following day. Mr.\nEricsson, who is principally attacked, writes to me that he in even\/\npoint confirms the notes and what he signed. . . . The account\nnow given by Lieutenant Hageus is also perfectly true, if we write\n.'Ahlgren' in place of 'Ericsson.' Amongst the 'other experiments'\nmentioned in my account, the following took place. Mr. Ahlgren\nasked that Anna should say how many coins he had in the pocket\nof his waistcoat ; and of what different kinds they were. She replied,\nlet us say, ' Seven,' (I think it was eight), stating that there was,\nlet us say, one piece of two crowns, one of one crown, three of 2\"i\nore, and two of 1 ore. Captain Ahlgren now took up what he\nhad in his pocket. The coins were as Anna had said ; but one\npiece of one ore was represented by a black button of the same\nsize. Mr. Ahlgren has told me that he does not remember the\nincident with the button, but that he perfectly well remembers\nthat Anna was quite right about the coins in Mr. Ericsson's purse.\"\nLieutenant Hageus' written statement at the time, confirmed by all the\nother witnesses, may certainly be preferred to his present recollection,\nin which the events of two separate experiments seem to have become,\nnot unnaturally, confused. As to the fact of frequent failure mentioned\nby Captain Braun, Dr. Backman replies that he has never denied this :\nhis contention having been throughout,\u2014not that all his experiments\nsucceeded,\u2014but that, as he says (Vol. VII., p. 219), \"such trials,\nthough we can never command success in them, prove that we have to\ndo here with a human faculty not yet recognised and which is worthy\nof being studied and established by scientific experiments.\"\nWe are glad that Dr. Backman's reconls have thus been sub\njected to a searching local criticism. That criticism seems to us to have\nbrought out evidence which has strengthened rather than weakened our\nconfidence in his accuracy. At the same time we thoroughly agree\nwith Dr. Backman's own view, as above expressed, that the faculty\nwhose sporadic and fugitive existence in certain human beings these\nexperiments and others resembling them have often already indicated\nneeds for its complete scientific establishment experiments both more\nnumerous and more rigid than it has yet been possible for even the\nmost conscientious and diligent investigator to make.\n\f\fGeneral Meetings. 413\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETINGS.\nThe 54th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, October 28th, 1892, at 4 p.m. . the\nPresident in the chair.\nMr. F.

Il s'agit dans toutes deux d'une\nsuggestion d date fixe.\n\" Dans celle de M. Beaunis, le 172e jour se trouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment\nle jour de la nouvelle ann\u00e9e, et le sujet en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 averti. M. Beaunis\nlui avait ainsi parl\u00e9 : 'Le 1er Janvier, 1885, \u00e0 10 heures du matin,\nvous me verrez, ifec.' Apr\u00e8s cela, que la suggestion soit faite le 14\nJuillet, ou bien le 14 ou le 30 D\u00e9cembre, \u00e0 172 jours, ou bien \u00e0 17 ou\n\u00e0 2 jours d'intervalle, le sujet n'a toujours qu'\u00e0 retenir une date et une\ndate remarquable.

Il faudrait voir si le sujet r\u00e9aliserait la suggestion apr\u00e8s\nl'intervalle fix\u00e9. Dans ce cas, et dans ce cas seulement, on pourrait\nl'intituler : ' Suggestion \u00e0 237 jours d'intervalle.'\n\" Mais il est \u00e0 craindre qu'il n'en serait pas ainsi.

Et, si m\u00eame je n'ai pas encore publi\u00e9 mes exp\u00e9riences, c'est\npar une esp\u00e8ce de pudeur scientifique ; c'est pareeque je n'aime pas \u00e0\noffrir au lecteur l'\u00e9tonnant sous l'habit du merveilleux.\n\"J'ajouterai encore, par rapport aux insucc\u00e8s, qu'il pourrait se faire\nqu'ils fussent plus apparents que r\u00e9els, comme on le verra tant\u00f4t.\n. . . \" Par deux fois, il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 un de mes sujets d'accomplir\nla suggestion sans quitter son fauteuil et sans faire un mouvement.

Je l'ai pos\u00e9 \u00e0 un brillant \u00e9l\u00e8ve en m\u00e9decine,\nqui a donn\u00e9 successivement les trois r\u00e9ponses suivantes : une heure de\nl'apr\u00e8s-midi ; 4 heures du matin ; 2 heures du matin. Il lui a fallu\ntrois minutes de r\u00e9flexion pour trouver cette derni\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse, et encore\nfaut-il noter qu'il \u00e9tait averti chaque fois de son erreur. On n'avance\ndonc pas une chose t\u00e9m\u00e9raire en affirmant que ce probl\u00e8me exige des\nefforts de raisonnement d\u00e9passant certainement les facult\u00e9s de deux filles\nde la campagne se pla\u00e7ant comme servantes.\nEnfin, ni l'une ni l'autre, mais J. principalement, ne savent pas tr\u00e8s\nbien lire l'heure au cadran.\nIl est clair d\u00e8s lors que si le sujet accomplit l'ordre au moment\nd\u00e9sign\u00e9, on peut en conclure qu'il a en lui comme un m\u00e9canisme de\nr\u00e9veil remont\u00e9 pour un temps limit\u00e9. Cette comparaison para\u00eetra plus\njuste encore si l'on veut bien consid\u00e9rer que les ordres donn\u00e9s \u00e9taient\nou grotesques ou sans importance, et que parfois l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance tombait au\nmilieu de la nuit.\nJe n'ai plus qu'un mot \u00e0 ajouter. En fait d'exp\u00e9riences de l'esp\u00e8ce,\nce sont surtout les r\u00e9ussites qui doivent entrer en ligne de compte.\nLes \u00e9checs sont peu significatifs. Il est \u00e9vident qui si, sur dix sugges\ntions, les sujets en r\u00e9alisent la moiti\u00e9, on ne peut invoquer le hasard.\nC'est le cas de leur appliquer le mot de l'Abb\u00e9 Galiani et de pr\u00e9tendre\nqu'ils sont pip\u00e9s.\nIl ne me reste plus qu' \u00e0 rappeler que M. et J. \u00e9taient dress\u00e9es \u00e0\nse souvenir, sur ma demande, de ce qu'elles avaient fait et pens\u00e9 en\n\u00e9tat d'hypnose. L'interrogatoire \u00e9tait conduit avec la plus grande\nprudence. J'usais toujours de termes vagues : \" N'avez-vous pas eu\nune dr\u00f4le d'envie aujourd'hui 1 Quelle envie ?

Blair Thaw.\nII.\nSOME EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nBy Dr. A. Blair Thaw.\nIt is manifest that in experiments intended to prove thought-\ntransference all possibility of perception by the senses must be\nexcluded. With this object the following rules were adopted in the\nexperiments about to be described and any infringement of them is\nnoted in its proper place.\n1st, with regard to the Muscular sense : There must be no contact\nbetween the person who is to take the active part and the person who\nis to try to receive the impressions.\n2nd, as to the sense of Sight : The percipient must have his eyes\ncarefully covered with a dark bandage, and the object must be outside\nhis field of vision, supposing no bandage were used.\n3rd, as to Hearing : The agent or agents must maintain perfect\nsilence, speaking only when it is necessary for the purpose of the\nexperiments, as for instance, to tell the percipient what kind of objects\nhe is to look for, as colours, numbers, ic. All cards, numbers and\ncolours should be chosen at random.\nIt is not an easy matter to name the conditions which will tend to\ngive the best results. As has been said elsewhere, it is important to\nremember that \" Questions of mood, of goodwill, of familiarity, may\nhold the same place in psychical investigation as questions of tempera\nture in a physical laboratory.\"\nIt is probably true that the passive condition in the percipient, so\nnecessary for success, is most easily attained through hypnotism. In\nsome of my experiments, however, the best results were obtained with\nthe percipient in a normal state. A question arises here : whether the\ndifference of condition is not a merely apparent one, considering the\npossibility of self-hypnotisation on the part of the so-called normal\npercipient. On the other hand, it should be observed that, in these\nexperiments, in every instance when the percipient was hypnotised at\nthe beginning of a series, the suggestible condition may in itself have\nlasted but a short time, while the suggested state, of a passive,\nreceptive nature, lasted more or less to the end of the trials, the\npercipient always being in a natural state at the end.\nThe fleeting nature of all phenomena of this kind is one of the\nchief difficulties encountered in investigating them. If a percipient\ncan be put in the right condition by a word or two, or by a moment's\n\fSome Experiments in Thought-Transference. 423\npressure on the forehead, as in the cases here mentioned, the distinction\nbetween such a state and that of a percipient who reaches what is\napparently the same condition spontaneously, is possibly a distinction\nwithout a difference. It is, perhaps, just this fleeting, elusive quality\nwhich lends to the experimental study of these phenomena much of the\ninterest which attaches to the more remote and rarer spontaneous\nmanifestations, while, in these experiments, the safeguards against error\nof judgment can be easily applied. In any case, to try to secure the\nbest conditions for an experiment is an axiom of science, as \" organised\ncommon sense,\" and this has been our chief object of endeavour.\nThe experiments in themselves are simple and interesting, and the\nmaterial is always at hand. No great amount of time is required ; an\nhour every few days will suffice ; and it must not be forgotten that the\nstudy of thought-transference occupies a primary position as a branch\nof psychical research, in more than one sense.\nIt was for such reasons that the writer promised to read a report of\nsome experiments. It may add something to the interest of the report\nto state here that the greater part of the trials themselves were made\nduring the month that passed between the making of the promise and\nthe writing of the present paper.\nBefore proceeding with the details, it may be well to quote and\napply to our experiments the following sentence of Mr. Gurney's : \" We\nmay venture to say that a candid critic, present during the whole\ncourse of the experiments, would have carried away a far more vivid\nimpression of their genuineness than any printed record can convey.\"\nThe effect on those present at such experiments is often due quite as\nmuch to half successes and indirect evidence as to more directly\nsuccessful results.\nThe first series of experiments was made with the percipient in a\nlight trance. The objects looked at by the agent being of a miscel\nlaneous character, and taken from different parts of the house without\nthe percipient's knowledge. The house happened to be rented, furnished,\nof friends, who left their bric-a-brac, ifec.\nThe report, made verbatim, at the time of the experiments, is as\nfollows :\u2014\u2022\nFirst Series.\nNew York, April 3rd, 1892.\nMrs. Thaw Percipient. Dr. Thaw Agent. Witness, Mrs. Dow.\nAfter each experiment the agent touched the percipient's forehead to\nhelp her into the passive state, but never selected an object for the next\nexperiment until after the contact was discontinued.\nAgent holds first two objects against white paper.\n1st Object. Bronze Statuette, Classic Bust, Helmet and Beard.\u2014\nPercipient in one or two minutes says : Is it a picture? At this point,\n\f42-i Dr. A. Blair Thaw.\nreferring to percipient's putting it in form of a question, witness says impul\nsively, \"That's not quite right.\" But this remark would hardly suggest\nwhat follows. After long pause, percipient continues : A reproduction of\nthe human face. Dark. A statuette. Bronze. Beard. Hat on it. Slouch\nhat, cai?. Has a ruff. (Back of bust suggests a ruff.) (Experiment took 10\nminutes.)\n2nd Object. A Pair of Scissors.\u2014Agent writes above report on paper\nin his hand. Percipient says: Something white. Agent says \"No.\"\nWriting on it. Agent puts away paper here, as it was evidently in perci\npient's mind. Percipient continues : If not white, shing. A white shine, not\na gold shine. Moundish. Engraved. A pair of scissors. (Percipient says\nsomething long and sharp was in her mind from the beginning.) (Experiment\nlasted 4 minutes.)\n3rd Object. A Cabinet Photo of \" X \" brought by agent from upstairs\nbefore sitting.\u2014Percipient says: Something square. A picture. A picture\nof a brass bed. Agent says \" Wrong.\" Photograph of \"AT.\" (Experiment\ntook two or three minutes.)\n4th Object. An old soiled $10.00 Bill.\u2014Percipient says : Square. (Per\ncipient on being asked what she means by \"square\" says \" Square-cornered.\")\nIt is a book with corners. Dark in colour. Made of two colours. It is a\nkindergarten mat made bg a child. Agent says \"Wrong.\" It is another\npicture. Has letters on it. A picture not of something h uman, but of swnething\nin nature. Has a big 0 on it, or like an 0 or two O's together. It is a picture\nin colour. The colour darker titan the thing. The colour like ink. (Experiment\ntook ten to fifteen minutes.)\n5th Object. A Red-covered Book with Black Cross and Letters on cover,\n\"Saint Paul,\" by F. W. H. Myers. Percipient says : I think this is some\nthing dark in colour. Isit anything square ? Square and dark. It is a paper-\ncovered book. Agent says \" No.\" Percipient continues : Tin's time it is a book.\nIt has writing on the outside. lieddish brownish colour. Capital E on outside.\nIs it the book on Evolution f \"Wrong.\" Is there anything stuck on it?\n\"No.\" (Experiment took from five to ten minutes.)\nPercipient was told the name of the book and insisted that the name\nof Mr. Myers was in her mind all the time, but connected with the paper-\ncovered Proceedings of the S.P.R., and when told the book was not paper-\ncovered gave up the name of Mr. Myers.\n0th Object. Agent's Watch (with Chain). \u2014Percipient says : Bright.\nWhite Bright. No, gold bright. Either a walch or chain. (Experiment\ntook 2 minutes.)\n7th Object. Spectacle Case.\u2014A shining black with letters and arabesques\nand an eagle in gold on it. Percipient says : It's square ; has corners. There's\nwriting on it. If not writing, has a picture on it. I think it's a book or a\npicture on a paper. I see it reddish. Long rather than square. Like a pencil\nor paper cutter, or knife. It shines. White shine or silver shine. Agent\nasked colour of letters. Gold, with one or two arabesques. (Correct.)\nSth Object. Long Round Bkass Wire Helical Spuing. Larger at one end.\n\u2014Percipient says : This is dark coloured.

(Rim reflecting light.) Bottom has corners. Something\nbreakable.\n11th Object. A Ssiall Brass Key.\u2014Percipient says : Small. Smaller\nthan the other object. Shines. Shines white. (True in some lights. Alight-\ncoloured brass.) Is it sharp ? Boundness of some kind. Agent asks, \" What\nkind?\" Roundness fiat. Roundness also of a long thing. It has a handle.\nIs it sili'er ? Is it a toilet article ? Colour 1 It has a gold shiuc.\n12th Object. A Small Ear Syringe. Round Bulb.\u2014Percipient : Dark.\nBrownish. Flat. Corners. Long. A book.\n13th Object. The last object of this series is a book of Mother Goose's\nMelodies, with a picture of Mother Goose playing piano on the cover.\u2014Per\ncipient : No shine. Not dark. Not white. At this point, agent being a\nlittle tired, stopped actual visualisation of the book as an object, leaned back\nin his chair, and for the first time noticing Mother Goose was playing with\nher claws on the piano, being amused by this, fell to thinking of the general\nintellectual conception of the book. Percipient suddenly says, It has some\nthing to do trith the mind. Agent in surprise exclaims, \" With the mind ? \"\nin a tone which discouraged percipient at first. Percipient continues : It\nhas to do with library rather than bedroom. It has to do with Art. Agent\nasks, \"What Art?\" (This is an error of an impulsive character such as\nsometimes is made.) It is one of my crayons. It has something to do with\nwriting, composition. Music too. It has been in the library. Hither with\nsomething done in Art or with somebody doing something in an Art. Agent\nlooking at Mother Goose at this time. Either work done or person doing it.\nIt has something to do with a book. It has something to do with a book with a\npicture in it. It has something to do with a book of pictures or of music. It\nis a book. It is the Mother Goose book.\nThe Mother Goose book was in percipient's mind from the beginning, but\nshe wanted to see if it would persist. It continued to appear at times. The\nimage was so clear that percipient was afraid of its being a conscious thought\nor guess and so put it off.\nThus of thirteen objects six were correctly named, the fifth object\nbeing called a book correctly, though the particular book was not\n\f426 Dr. A, Blair Thaw.\nnamed. (Five of the eight objects on the first clay were named cor\nrectly.) In five of the remaining seven objects, the answers indicated\nthat the percipient was on the right track, and only two of the experi\nments can be regarded as complete failures.\nIn the next series of experiments (April 17th) of the same kind,\nwith similar objects, with the same agent and percipient, and under\nthe same conditions, except that the percipient was not hypnotised, the\nresults were not so good. Of six objects not one was named. At the\nsame time the results were better than mere chance would give. Of\ntwelve statements as to colour (including light, dark, 4c.) eight were\nright, two partly right, and two wrong. The nearest approach to cor\nrect description of outline was with a pair of spectacles (described as\n\" sort of round, round in one place and then long,\") and a cigar\n(described as \" little, roundish, longer than round \").\nThe percipient, who acted as such in all the experiments so far re\nported, while she is the best one I have found, generally speaking, is\nespecially sensitive to some sudden change of idea or sensation, and\nmore likely to succeed when such a change is made, while in anything\nlike an extended series of routine experiments, such as those with play\ning cards, she seems perhaps to have less success than some of the\nothere. In one series of fifteen playing cards she had no success at all,\nand in a series of colour experiments succeeded but little better. These\nformed part of a series of experiments of a routine character, with\npercipients taken at random, in a normal state, and guessing rapidly,\nwith no effort to secure good conditions. It is a short series in itself\nand shows a number of successes slightly greater than pure chance\nwould give, as seems to be the case in all experiments of this indiscrimi\nnate sort. In detail they do not make very interesting reading, and\nwill serve chiefly to bring down the general percentage of our successes.\nFor, of course, every trial must be counted in a report.\nAfter the various experiments had been brought together and tab\nulated, we had, fortunately, on April 26th and 28th, two remarkably\ngood series of experiments. They are interesting for one reason,\nbecause in one case the percipient was in a normal condition, and in the\nother case hypnotised. They are particularly interesting to the writer,\nbecause he was himself one of the percipients, happening to feel confi\ndent at the time of attaining the passive condition which is so essential\nto success.\nIn the first series, the percipient was a friend, a good hypnotic\nsubject, whom I put in a light trance before the experiments began.\nThe following is a report of this sitting :\u2014.\nApril 26th, 1892.\nMr. M.

A Red Disc is chosen.\u2014Percipient is not told anything.\nPercipient continues to see clouds and blue flames. On being asked to see\ncolour, percipient says : Pink or red. It is red. It is a disc.\nPercipient possibly saw coloured discs in a pile in the house a week before,\nbut, on being asked, said he did not remember them. Ho thought it was a\ndisc pasted on square of white paper. The discs used are of the kind sold\nfor kindergartens.\n3rd Object. Green Disc\u2014Purple. Blue.\n+ 4th Object. Yellow.\u2014Light green.

After a long and unusual effort on part of both agent and\npercipient, we moved into another room on account of the noise in the street.\nDuring this move agent held card on top of pack, face downwards.\nAdmitting the agent's assertion as to card being face downwards while\nmoving, the following is a curious result.\n2nd Object.

The percipient himself told the agents to change character of\nobject after each actual failure, thus getting new sensations.\nPercipient was told to go into next room and get something.\n*lst Object. Silver Inkstand chosen.\u2014Percipient, without moving, says :\nI think of something but it is too bright and easg. It is the silver inkstand.\nPercipient told to get something in next room.\n2nd Object. A Glass Candlestick.\u2014Percipient went to right corner of\nthe room and to the cabinet with the object on it, but could not distinguish\nwhich object.\nPercipient had handkerchief off to be able to walk, but was not followed\nby agents, and did not see them. Agents found percipient standing with\nhands over candlestick undecided.\nIn the first series of experiments of April 26th and 28th, Mr.\nWyatt, who was hypnotised, named or described, out of a total of\nnineteen objects, two completely right (marked alxive by an asterisk \u2666),\nten partly right (marked above by a cross t), and seven wrong ; while\nthe writer, who was in what would be called a normal state, named\nor described, out of a total of twenty-one objects, eight completely\nright (marked above by an asterisk \u2666), nine partly right (marked above\nby a cross t) and only four wrong.\nBoth series were conducted under the same conditions as regards\nchecks on error ; i.e., the percipient had both eyes and ears tied up,\nand the agents kept silent except when it was necessary to say when\ncards or numbers or colours were to be used.\nIt is from such trials as these last, and those first described with\nMrs. Thaw as percipient, that we may learn something as to the\nconditions for success.\nWe have not noticed that the condition or the general visualising\npower of the agent has much direct effect on results, except, of course,\nthat fatigue after too prolonged a sitting will interfere with active exer\ntions. An hour is about the limit ; the only important function of the\nagent being that he should use his mind and his senses to the utmost\ncapacity and at the same time try to impress the percipient with the\n\f430 Dr. A. Blair Thaw.\nidea. The latter seems to be as necessary as the former effort on the\npart of the agent.\nThe observations of the English experimenters on thought-trans\nference, in regard to the conditions in the percipient which conduce to\nsuccess, apply very precisely to my experiments. A serious failure\noften interferes with further success, and after a success others are\nmost likely to follow. In the ordinary routine experiments, even when\nthe general results are poor, the successes are often successive. For\ninstance, while Mrs. Thaw guessed only two right out of twenty-five\ncards, allowing two guesses, these two were the third and fourth cards of\nthe series, and she guessed the second card of the series on a third guess\nThis expectancy is something which must be added to the merely\npassive condition. The presence of a stranger does not necessarily\nspoil the phenomena. It depends rather on the percipient's feelings\nwith regard to him.\nAll the percipients except myself seem to have some sort of clear\nvision of the object, more so, often, when the object is afterwards rightly\nnamed ; many of the successes are reached with a certain decision\nwhich adds to the effect on those . present. For myself, I cannot\ndescribe my sensation as a visualisation of any kind. It seemed rather\nto be by some wholly subjective process that I knew what the agents\nwere looking at. This is true even in the cases when I had to distin\nguish between the five and the six, or the one and the seven. Those\npercipients who seem really to see the object often find that there are\nmany in view from time to time, but that one persistently recurs.\nMrs. Thaw found it so particularly, and perhaps this accounts both for\nher variety of visualisation, her successful description of complicated\nobjects, and her tendency to failure in the routine experiments, as in\ncards, when the whole pack seemed to march across the mental stage.\nThere seems to be a case of latency in the percipient's mind, or of\ndeferred transference from the agent's mind, in the trial of April 2Sth,\nin which Mr. Wyatt named the 10 of Diamonds some minutes after it\nhad been exchanged for another object. A similar tendency will be\nnoticed during some experiments still to be described, in which the\npercipient selects the first of two ideas which have been in the agent's\nmind, when the agent is consciously thinking only of the second one.\nThe general results show, as has been noticed, a marked tendency\nto fail with monotony of sensation, and to succeed with new and\ndistinct objects, or by changing the class of objects frequently.\nThe table of experiments on colours shows a distinct fact, so far as\nsuch a short series may carry weight. Of 55 guesses made by\nthe percipients 35 were distributed among the first four colours\nof the spectrum, or not much more than might be expected by chance ;\nwhile of the 14 correct guesses 13 were made with these first four\n\fSome Experiments in Thought-Transference. 431\ncolours. It would seem imre than probable that this result was\ndue to the more vivid impression made on the agent's mind by these\nmore brilliant colours. In the same way, of ten trials made with the\nsensation of taste, the more distinct tastes were perceived and named\ncorrectly, as salt and mustard, while weak or mixed tastes were not\nnamed.\nTo sum up the results of all the experiments, we have as follows :\nCards and numbers show only a little more than the average of chance.\nOf 84 playing cards 2 were right on the first guess. Counting first and\nsecond guesses, there were 10 right, while chance would give 4 right\nat the most. In naming the suit there were 27 successes to a probable\n21 if by chance alone.\nOf 41 numbers (using the nine digits) 8 were right on the first\nguess, while chance would give 4 right. Counting two guesses 14 were\nright, while chance would give 9 right. \u2022\nOf 26 miscellaneous objects, 6 were rightly named on the first guess,\nand 2 on the second guess, or 8 in all, while chance would give a very\nsmall fraction of probable success.\nOf 55 colors, 14 were correct on the first guess and 11 on the\nsecond guess, while chance gives 6 on the first guess to 14 actually\nnamed, and 1 2 on the two guesses, to 25 actually named.\nThe last trial of April 28th consisted of the transference to the\npercipient's mind of the agent's thought in regard to an object in the\nnext room ; the percipient being simply told to get something in the\nnext room, goes in there and reaches the vicinity of the object but\nfails to pick it up. This introduces a class of experiments much like\nthe willing game, but without contact. In these experiments, with\nmotion necessary on the part of the percipient, it is sometimes the idea\nof an object that is transferred, and it sometimes seems to be an\nindistinct motor impulse of some kind, leading him near the object.\nInsomuch as the percipient was not, and could not be blindfolded,\nthese experiments do not fulfil the conditions we laid down for ourselves,\nbut as a matter of fact the percipient did not look at the agents. The\nexperience of an honest percipient in such experiments is, however,\nsometimes the best kind of evidence for the tendency to involuntary\ndeception. At the same time he may sometimes get first-class personal\nproof as to actual transference of the agent's thought.\nThe tendency to get the first of two ideas which may have distinctly\nentered the agent's mind seems to afford evidenceof thought-transference\nas distinct from involuntary guidance. For the agent's conscious effort\nis entirely toward the second of the two, while the percipient may\npersist in the direction of the first object. Several cases of this kind\nwere noted. In one of the last trials, the percipient, after much con\nfusion, brings both objects thought of\u2014the bag and the book.\nit a 2\n\f432 Dr. A. Blair Thaw.\nOne useful object of this kind of experiment is for diversion ; at\nthe same time they serve as an indirect aid to the study of the condi\ntions to be sought for, in conducting experiments of the more routine\nsort, with all the usual checks on error applied. If we accept the\nevidence for thought-transference as sufficient, these latter trials may be\nas useful as any others for the study of these conditions.\nOf the 30 trials to be described, 13 (marked below with an\nasterisk*) were complete successes and 12 more (marked below with a\ncrossf) were partially successful.\nExperiments like the Willing Game, but Without Contact.\nMarch 5th, 1892.\nMrs. Thaw Percipient and Dr. Thaw Agent.\nMrs. Thaw, after a few experiments in hypnotism, while apparently fully\nconscious, but in passive condition, was told to\n*lst Experiment.

The rarity and the\npractical uselessness of such phenomena tell in favour of the\nview that this supernormal perceptivity has not been acquired\nby terrene evolution.\nXX.\u2014Review of the forms of vision known to us, external and internal.\nStarting from the synesthesie of which sound-seeing is a con\nspicuous example, and which stand on the dividing line between\nexternal and internal percepts, we first follow external vision\nthrough entoptic vision and after-images into our ordinary sight\nof the world around us. We next follow internal vision through\nmemory-images and imagination-images to those subliminally-\ninitiated images, post-hypnotic, hypermnesic, hypersesthetic, &c.,\nof which the crystal-visions above cited have supplied examples.\nXXI. \u2014The wide scope and promising future of this novel form of psycho\nlogical experiment. Invitation to send records of experiment to\nthe writer, at Leckhampton House, Cambridge.\n[Some part of the following paper was read at the International\nCongress of Experimental Psychology, London, August 3rd, 1892, as a\ncommunication on \" The Experimental Induction of Hallucinations.\"]\nI.\u2014We have already discussed in several papers certain modes in\nwhich the consciousness and the faculties ordinarily known to us appear\n\f438 Jiff. F. W. H. Myers.\nto be interrupted or supplemented by the emergence of some kind of\nfaculty presumably inherent in our own being, yet not included in the\nstream of thought and feeling with which we are accustomed to\nidentify ourselves.\nThe nature of this faculty is, to begin with, entirely obscure : and\nthe word subliminal has been chosen for it expressly as assuming\nnothing more than the obvious fact that its operation is in some sense\nbeneath what we are accustomed to term the threshold of conscious\nness. Again, this subliminal activity has been regarded as a kind of\nconsciousness because the hidden form of activity seems strongly to\nresemble the superficial and familiar one to which the word conscious\nness is commonly applied. The observed operations of the subliminal\npart of the self are often such as, when occurring in supraliminal life,\ninvolve the presence of consciousness. And moreover, one of the most\nstriking of the phenomena which we are trying to collect and explain\nconsists in the occasional complete replacement of the supraliminal\nconsciousness by the subliminal, which then, of course, though tempor\narily and as it were accidentally, becomes supraliminal in its turn.\nOnly a few groups of subliminal phenomena have as yet been dis\ncussed. But it has already become evident that such phenomena are\ntoo numerous and too imperfectly known to be at present arranged in\nany completely logical series. We must be content to indicate several\npossible modes of arrangement, and to use each mode in turn as may\nbest subserve that clearness which it is not easy to attain when facts at\nonce complex and fragmentary have to be pieced together.\nFor the sake of clearness I introduced the metaphor of a spectrum\nof total consciousness, prolonged at either end beyond the limits of\nsupraliminal consciousness\u2014extending at the red end into the deeps of\norganic life, and at the violet end into a world of supersensory percep\ntions ; stfpersensory at least in the sense that the recognised external\nsenses can here no longer be employed. I have illustrated the opera\ntion of subliminal perceptions and powers lying beyond the red end by\ncertain facts of hypnotic suggestion. I have then tried to show that\nsimilar subliminal activity is going on also along the red to violet\nspectrum of which we are supraliminally as well as subliminally\ncognisant. For this purpose I cited certain facts connected with\ngenius and with dreams. I have now to follow these subliminal activities\nbeyond the violet end of the spectrum\u2014into the region of telepathy,\nclairvoyance, retrocognition, premonition.\nObserve, however, that the two subliminal prolongations of my\nimaginary spectrum\u2014say the phenomena of power over organic pro\ncesses, and of clairvoyance\u2014do in fact approach each other, instead\nof lying more and more widely apart, so that my spectrum ought\nto be imagined as circular, not linear, and with the infra-red and\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 439\nultra-violet regions running into each other in some deeply hidden way.\nAnd observe in the second place that any real glimpse which we get of\nthe subliminal spectrum is apt not only to show us certain lines or bands\nwith specitil clearness, but to give us also a dimmer view of distant\nportions. Thus, for instance, the lessons of hypnotic suggestion are by\nno means limited to its profounder organic effects. We shall have to\nrecur to it in connection with clairvoyance and precognition also.\nII.\u2014And we are coming now to a point where it seems convenient\nno longer to confine our attention to one region of the spectrum, but\nrather to take a certain definite group of phenomena, and trace the\nlines and bands which correspond to those phenomena in all parts of\nour spectrum. I propose to attempt this task in the present paper for\nthe phenomena of sensory automatism.\nFirst, however, I must define what I mean by the automatic action\nof the senses. Up to this point, the indications or messages sent\nupwards by the subliminal self have been of a kind not easy to appor\ntion between the two groups\u2014sensory and motor\u2014into which ordinary\nsupraliminal nervous activity is commonly divided. Under which head\nshould we have classed the production of a blister by suggestion ? or\nthe musical impulse of Mozart ? or even ordinary dreams,\u2014which mix\nsensory imagery with representation of motion, finding outlet occa\nsionally in actual movements of head and limbs?\nBut we are now coming to subliminal \" messages \" of a more\nprecise and definite character. We are passing from messages which\ncarry all their meaning in the phenomenon itself to messages which\ncontain apparentlypurposive s'ujns ;\u2014gestures, pictures, or verbalisation.\nAnd the verbalisation (for instance) may come in any one of the four\n\u2022ways in which we verbalise in common life ; in the mainly sensory modes,\nnamely reading and hearing, or in the mainly motor modes, namely speak\ning and writing. We shall find, no doubt, that among these verbal and\npictorial messages the interchange between sensory and motor phe\nnomena will be subtle and frequent. But still we shall gain in clearness\nif at first we ignore such interchange; if we take first the group of\nsensory automatic messages, and then the group of motor automatic\nmessages, beginning in each case with messages whose content falls\nwell within the habitual range of supraliminal perception, and going\non to messages of telepathic or clairvoyant type.\nAnd I shall define the automatic action of each sense in turn as the\nproduction and presentation of images due neither to external stimuli nor\nto the voluntary direction of attention from within. Let us take the most\nimportant sense as a type. Vision is usually divided into external and\ninternal ; external vision resulting from the impression made by the\n\u2022world around us upon the retina, and constituting our only source of\nfresh visual knowledge ; and internal vision consisting of memory\n\f440 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nimages and imagination-images ;\u2014the voluntary or involuntary recall\nor rearrangement of images originally received through the retina from\nthe world without us. Such recall or rearrangement may, of course,\nhelp us to new ideas (as to the first conception of a steam-engine), but\ncannot, in the ordinary view, inform us of any fresh facta external to\nourselves. And inasmuch as this internal visualisation seems useful\nonly as an aid to the carrying on of our mental processes, most men are\napt to dwell mainly on that part of it which is voluntary, and to\ntreat as insignificant or even morbid that part of it which is involun\ntary or automatic. They attach importance to Watt's power of seeing\ndistinctly in his mind's eye the behaviour of saturated vapour inside\na vessel of varying temperature and capacity ; but they regard dreams\nas trifling, and waking hallucinations as mere indications of disease.\nAs to the vague fragmentary pictures, amounting neither to dream\nnor to hallucination, which are constantly welling up \"of their own\naccord \" in most men, it is only quite lately that they have been traced\nand noted down even as a curiosity.\nThe reader will have already inferred that my own arrangement of\nmodes of visualisation is different in an important particular. I\nrecognise, of course, that external vision is the only means of obtain\ning optical knowledge\u2014I do not say of obtaining visual knowledge of\nany kind\u2014of the material world. And I recognise voluntary internal\nvisualisation\u2014recollection and rearrangement of images under the\nguidance of the supraliminal self\u2014as an important, though not an\nessential aid to ordinary mental operation. But out of the refuse,\nso to say, of the ordinary classification ;\u2014out of those residual phe\nnomena of internal vision, those unbidden and meaningless images which\nare commonly regarded as the mere sparks that fly from the mind's\nhurrying engine,\u2014out of these I make a third class, of automatic\nvisualisations, which I hold for at least as important as either of the\nother two classes. I maintain that visual knowledge, both of the\nmaterial world and of what we at present call immaterial relations,\nis in fact attainable through visions which I term automatic, as being\nneither evoked nor evocable by the supraliminal self, but which, as\nI hold, have their origin (or proximate origin) in the subliminal self,\nand carry up its messages into our current and familiar conscious\nness. I of course admit that in some cases these messages merely\nindicate disease and disintegration ; and that in most cases they are\nmeaningless, fragmentary, or abortive. But I claim that in some\ncases they convey real knowledge, acquired by some perceptivity\nwhich is possessed only by the subliminal and not by the supraliminal\nself. What the relation of that original perceptivity may be to\nsight, as we know sight, I do not pretend to say. Since the knowledge\npresents itself in pictorial form we may conjecture that it normally\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 441\ninvolves the activity of those parts of the brain which are concerned\nwith vision ; butwhether the unimpaired existence of those parts is neces\nsary to this automatic visualisation I cannot tell. We know that usually\nthe external eye must work for six or seven years after birth if the parts\nof the brain which govern vision are to retain through life, after the eye's\ndestruction, their power of internal sight. It is conceivable that\nin some such way as the eye's activity is required to develop the power\nof voluntary inward visualisation, so also the power of voluntary\ninward visualisation may be required to develop (though it need not\ncreate) the power of automatic inward visualisation. This point deserves\nnotice because, as we shall see before long, it can to some extent be\nsettled by actual observation and experiment.\nSuch, then, is my first definition of the sensory automatism with\nwhich I have now to deal. But where, it may be asked, am I to get my\nexamples ? How am I to fill up this wide framework with the scrappy\nmaterials which others have deemed of so little worth 1 I reply that\nI draw my material mainly from sensory hallucinations, spontaneous\nor experimental ; and that no one can set a limit to the material thus\nforthcoming, inasmuch as it was only, so to say, yesterday that spon\ntaneous hallucinations were first registered, or experimental hallucina\ntions induced.\nOne word, in passing, upon the term hallucination\u2014so often occur\nring in these Proceedings, and now emphasised for even wider use. A\nhallucination of the senses, as defined by Edmund Gurney, is \"a per\ncept which lacks, but which can only by distinct reflection be recognised\nas lacking, the objective basis which it suggests.\" 1\nThe word as thus defined is mainly of negative connotation ; and\nfor that very reason was all the more appropriately applied to phe\nnomena as to whose nature we wished to take as little for granted as\npossible. But for the same reason it has been objected to by some\ncritics as involving in popular parlance so marked an absence of truth\nor reality that the prefix to this noun of the adjective veridical, or\ntruth-telling, seemed almost to involve a paradox. The word still\nseems to me indispensable, but I may point out that something more\nof positive is now given to the same conception if for hallucination we\nsubstitute \" sensory automatism \" ; thus implying not so much that\nthe picture fails truly to represent the objects present to supraliminal\nvision, as that it aims at representing objects present to subliminal per\nception in some unknown way.\nI have said that neither the observation of the spontaneous halluci\nnations of sane persons nor the induction of experimental ones has\nuntil quite lately received any serious attention. The very idea of a\n\" Census of Hallucinations \"\u2014in default of which speculation on the\ni Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 459.\n\f442 Mr. F. W H. Myers.\nsubject was mere guesswork\u2014was duo to Edmund Gurney ; and to\nhis first effort was indirectly owing that wider International Census\nover which Professor Sidgwick has presided in England, and of which\nit is hoped that a report will appear in an early number of these\nProceedings. In view of this expected accession of knowledge I will\nhere postpone any detailed consideration of spontaneous hallucina\ntions, merely reminding the reader that in some hundreds of cases\nalready printed we have shown ground, more or less strong in each\ncase, for supposing that the hallucination was in some sense veridical ;\n.\u2014implied either a, clairvoyant knowledge of past, present, or future\nfacts, or a telepathic correspondence with the minds of living or\ndeparted persons other than the percipient himself. With the general\nlines of this evidence the reader will be familiar ; and he will have\nobserved also that such veridical hallucinations have been treated\nthroughout by Edmund Gurney and myself as belonging in some sort\nto subjacent strata of the intelligence, rather than to the ordinary\nstream of life. It is this view, often before hinted at in these\nProceedings, which I am here endeavouring to develop in especial con\nnection with various experimental facts which point the same way.\nIII.\u2014It is, I say, to experimentally-induced hallucinations that I\nmust now turn. Specimens of various types of these have been already\npublished, but since there seems still to exist in many minds some\ndislike to this whole group of experiments, it will be well to explain\nbriefly the position which, in my view, the group in question holds\namong the researches of experimental psychology ; to show how inevit\nably we are led to seek in this very direction if experiment is ever to\npenetrate as deeply as introspection in its own way penetrated into the\nsprings of our being.\nThe movement which is now striving to convert psychology into a\ntruly experimental science may be seen on analysis to have originated\nmainly in two impulses, which were not at first closely allied to each\nother, and are even now but imperfectly fused together.\nThe first of these impulses was due to the general scientific spirit of\nthe age. Savants, accustomed to the exactitude of modern biology, and\nfinding one branch hereof, namely neurology, conterminous with a\npsychological region mapped out in so much vaguer a style, have\nnaturally wished to push their methods as far as possible over the\nborder. But here two great difficulties are encountered. The first\nand obvious difficulty depends on the fact that psychology and neuro\nlogy, the objective and subjective aspects of the work of mind or brain,\nalthough in one sense identical in their subject-matter, are in another\nsense separated by a gulf wider than that which separates neurology\nfrom any other physical science whatever. Neurology can but photo\ngraph the outside of the fortress ; it has no direct testimony as to what\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousncss. 443\ngoes on within. A second difficulty lies in the fact that we cannot\ndeal with the human race in the same way as biology deals with\nanimals and plants. Interbreeding, environmental changes, vivisection,\nare impossible. We can indeed study the sense-organs, cerebral and\nexternal, in life and death. But beyond this, the psycho-physiologist\nis mainly reduced to the employment of physical methods not even\nspecial to biology ; determinations of time, weight, movement, etc., such\nas in one form or another are common to all sciences.\nHere again, then, there is a danger that the experiments will not be\nsufficiently intimate to bring real discovery in their train. They help\nus rather to define accurately facts already roughly known, than to get\nat underlying facts of which common consciousness does not inform us.\nTo do this we must pass from general mechanical artifices to artifices\nspecial to psychology. We may say that psychology is passing from the\ninitial state of each science in turn, when the new science depends on\nobservation only without experiment, into the second state when it\ndepends on experiment ; but that thus far it remains in that early stage\nof the second state when the methods of experiment are such as other\nsciences have suggested, not such as this special branch of inquiry\nsuggests for itself, or can use with unique effect. Thus, for instance,\nin the study of crystals men began by measuring their external angles.\nThen they sliced them and found their planes of cleavage ; and it\nseemed as though the crystals had been examined through and\nthrough. But with the discovery of the polarisation of light came a\nmore intimate analysis ; and we classify the crystal now by the be\nhaviour of the ray within. What we want to get hold of in psychology\nis some experiment which shall compare with the registry of reflexes\nand the description of end-organs as the polariscope compares with the\ngoniometer ; which shall avail to detect double or multiple refraction\nwithin a personality which to less subtle analyses seems still a limpid\nhomogeneous whole.\nBut in order to hit upon these specifically psychological experiments\nwe must, so to say, become as little children ; we must put ourselves\nhack into a state of scientific infancy ; we must reach at the moon to\nsee if by any chance we can pull it down. We must be content to\ngrope, as pioneers have always groped, among a forest of obscure possi\nbilities, rather than to march by a series of small but indisputable\nadvances along a road whose bearing is already known. This attitude\nis unwelcome to men who have grown accustomed to definite, irrefra\ngable progress ; and discoveries in a nascent science are consequently\napt to fall to outsiders.\nAnd thus it came about that that second main impulse towards an\nexperimental psychology of which I have already spoken took its rise\nin the crude theory, but fruitful experiments, of a discoverer who was\n\f4M Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nalso a charlatan. It was Mesmer who started the first really intimate,\nreally penetrating method of psychological experiment. And so new,\nso unwelcome, was that conception of profoundly modified personality\nwhich mesmerism or hypnotism implies, that it has taken a century\u2014\nI do not say to work it out\u2014but to get it recognised as worth serious\nstudy by official savants.\nThe path which this priceless method of experiment has actually\nfollowed has been lengthened and deflected by much of accident,\nprejudice, and error. But we have now advanced far enough to be able\nto look back through the winding ways, and to ask ourselves what\nreally was the short cut which we ought to have taken;\u2014the hint which\nought to have set us on the right road. Undoubtedly that hint was,\noffered to us by spontaneous somnambulism. In spontaneous somnam\nbulism might at any time have been observed on a small scale the very\nphenomena whose existence has been established with so much effort.\nHyperesthesia, anesthesia, alternating memory, suggestibility,\u2014all\nthese, not to speak of certain other phenomena not yet equally accepted,\nmight have been studied in the sleep-walkers and sleep-talkers who used\nto be noted as mere curiosities, as residual phenomena which it was\nnot worth while to try to explain.\nSurely we ought to learn something from this experience. We\nought to realise that experimental psychology cannot afford to push\naside adventurous experiments, inexplicable observations. For her,\nas for other sciences, it is the anomalies, the residual phenomena, which\nopen out fresh paths of discovery. And I believe, therefore, that I\nam merely treading in the ordinary paths of progress when I suggest\nthat in the odd, inexplicable phenomena of hallucination, or sensory\nautomatism, lies the hint and germ of discoveries which shall embrace\nman's whole self, whether lying above or below our transitory and\nshifting threshold of conscious life.\nIV.\u2014But, it will be asked, can we make this a really experimental\nstudy 1 Must we not content ourselves with simply watching these\nfleeting hallucinatory images as they rise and pass away? Is it\npossible to induce hallucinations 1 And, if possible, is it safe 1 1\ni I do not recommend my readers to take drags for the purpose of inducing hallu\ncinations. But since the action of drugs in generating hallucinatory sounds or images,\nis at present ill-understood, it might be interesting if persons to whom such drugs are\nadministered for other reasons would attempt crystal-vision and report results. I\nadd a brief account (mainly summarised from some notes kindly sent to me by Dr.\nMitchell Bruce) of some of these toxic hallucinations, which probably result in\nvarying proportions from affection of the end-organ or of the brain. Salicylate of\nsoda in some persons causes visions, mostly unpleasant, when the eyes are shut. This\neffect has been noted after five fifteen-grain doses of salicylic acid. Faces, Jtc., are\nseen, as in illusion* hypnagogiqucs. Digitalis in large doses may cause subjective\nsensations of light. \"After taking nearly one grain of digitalin,\" says Dr. Lauder\nBrunton, \"in the course of forty-eight hours, I suffered from the centre of the field of\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 445\nA satisfactory answer to these questions is furnished by the con\ntinual experimentation in hypnotic hallucinations which has been\ncarried on of late years at Nancy and elsewhere. Professor Bernheim\nand his friends have conclusively proved that hallucinations can be\ninduced in very many subjects, healthy both in body and mind,\nwithout any kind of consequent ill effect. There is no necessary\ninjury even from what looks most dangerous, namely, the very frequent\ninduction of hypnotic hallucination in a diseased subject. \" In one\nof my patients,\" says Dr. Bernheim,1 \" a very intelligent woman\naffected with locomotor ataxy, I have allowed myself to make, with her\nconsent, certain experiments [with the view of testing the effect of\nrepeated hallucinations], while carefully watching her psychical con\ndition, and keeping myself prepared to stop the experiment at the\nslightest alarming indication. I have on several occasions subjected\nher for several days in succession to complex and repeated hallucina\ntions\u2014hypnotic and post-hypnotic, immediate and deferred\u2014and no\ntrace has remained of all this. During three years that she has passed\nin my ward, in spite of very frequent suggestions given in waking\nhours and in the trance, her intelligence has continued equally alert, nor\nhas her power of initiative been impaired.\"\nThis is by no means an isolated case. Professor Bernheim himself\nhas several other living examples, some of whom he has allowed me to\nsee. And in a long series of experiments begun by Edmund Gurney at\nBrighton in 1883 and continued at intervals (mainly by Professor and\nMrs. Sidgwick), up to the present time, the same healthy and intelligent\nyoung men have been subjected (1887-92) to scores of hypnotic and\npost-hypnotic hallucinations, with no bodily or mental injury whatever.\nThere is, therefore, no reason to suppose that the mere fact of under\ngoing a hallucination is in itself either injurious, or an indication of\nweakness or disease.2\nvision being occupied by a bright spot surrounded by rainbow colours.\" Cannabit\nindica(Indian hemp: hashisch). The hallucinationscaused bythis drug arewell known,\nalthough their agreeable quality has been much exaggerated. An unusual degree of\nmotor automatism,\u2014uncontrollable speech, gesture, and the like,\u2014accompanies the\nvisual hallucinations. Automatic writing should be tried with these patients,\nespecially when the effect of the drug is going off, and the patient's mind appears to\nhimself to be in a normal state. To the hallucinations caused by alcohol and opium I\nneed do no more than refer. The singing in the ears caused by quinine sometimes,\ndevelops into a definite sound, as when a patient of Dr. Mitchell Bruce's begged his\nnurse to send away the barrel-organ which was perpetually repeating the same tune.\n\" Shell-hearing \" might be tried here.\n1 De la Suggestion, 1880, p. 414.\n* I am assuming, of course, that the experiments are conducted on suitable sub\njects, and with proper care. Harm may no doubt be done by hallucinating weak-\nminded subjects, or even by forgetting to remove the hallucination which has been\ninduced. I have seen a healthy and intelligent young man much puzzled at a\ndistressing sensation of lameness after being awakened from a trance in which several\n2 H\n\f446 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nHypnotic hallucinations have now been made in sufficient numbers\nto allow us to gather from them some instruction which will simplify\nour further inquiries. I will arrange these results briefly under three\nheads :\u2014\n1. Source or initiation of the hypnotic hallucination.\n2. Its intensity, duration, and optical behaviour.\n3. Its specific nature or content.\n1. \"Suggestion\" is now the regular answer to any question as to\nthe source of a hypnotic hallucination. A suggests to B that there is a\ncat on the sofa ;\u2014or B, if very sensitive, suggests to himself that there\nis a cat on the sofa ;\u2014and B then sees the cat. In my chapter on \" The\nMechanism of Suggestion \" I have tried to show that the most\nintelligible definition which we can give to that too fashionable word\nis, \" an appeal which somehow reaches the subliminal consciousness,\"\u2014\nwhether that appeal emanates from the supraliminal consciousness of\nthe operator-subject himself, or from either the supraliminal or the\nsubliminal consciousness of some operator other than himself. In\nordinary verbal suggestion, A's supraliminal self gives the order which\nB's subliminal or hypnotic self hears and obeys. In ordinary self-\nsuggestion, B's supraliminal self gives the order and his subliminal\nself hears and obeys it. But there may be \" spontaneous \" self-sugges\ntion, in which B's subliminal self both originates and carries out the\nsuggestion, without any supraliminal knowledge on B's part. And there\nmay be telepathic suggestion, when A's subliminal self\u2014perhaps with\nout the knowledge of his supraliminal self\u2014conveys the message to B\nat a distance. None of these four possible forms of suggestion\nabsolutely need the hypnotic trance, but the trance-condition seems to\nfacilitate all of them.\n2. Next, as to the duration, intensity, and optical behaviour of\nthe hallucinatory image thus induced. No absolute limit can be\nassigned to the duration of such an image, especially if occasionally\nrenewed by fresh suggestion. Its intensity may vary from mere float\ning vagueness to a mimicry so complete that the subject, asked to\ndecide between a real rose and a hallucinatory rose, will sometimes be\nunable to say which is which. To make this mistake possible there\nsuggestions had been made to him and had then been dispelled. The fact was that\none of the suggestions made was that he was lame, and the operator had forgotten to\nremove this. A word set the matter right ; but had this word not been spoken the\ninconvenience might have lasted for some hours. The evil effects sometimes noticed\nin persons who have allowed themselves to be hypnotised by Donate orother perambu-\nlatory mesmerists are, I believe, largely due to thn mere culpable neglect of the\nmesmerist to abolish the hallucinations which he has inspired. \" I have seen,\" says\nDr. Hamilton Osgood, the well-known physician of Boston, U.S.A., \"many neuroses\ncured; I have never seen one caused by suggestion. I have seen the intelligence\nrestored ; I have never seen a mind enfeebled by suggestion.\"\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 447\nmust generally be a great intensification of the subject's ordinary\nvisualising power. Very few persons can voluntarily summon up an\nimage of a rose so life-like as to be indistinguishable from a real rose.\nAs to the obedience or otherwise of these hallucinatory images to\noptical laws, the question is by no means easy to decide. There are two\nwell-known views, commonly assigned to the Nancy and Paris schools\nrespectively ; there is a third view of Professor Lombroso's, which thus\nfar lacks confirmation ; and, finally, my own way of regarding the\nmatter differs from all these views, although in some sense it combines\nthem.\nA. Simplest of all is the opinion of the Nancy school, which main\ntains that the optical behaviour of the image is, like the image itself,\na pure result of suggestion. The subject sees the imago modified as he\nexpects to see it modified. He follows the hypnotiser's hints ; and if\ntold that he is looking at it through a magnifying glass he sees it\nenlarged, although the glass may be a plain one. There can be no\ndoubt that this is, at least, sometimes the case ; that, whatever other\nlaws may be at work, the brute force of suggestion, so to say, can some\ntimes overrule them all.\nB. Equally simple, and almost equally demonstrable in certain cases,\nis the view of Binet and Ferd, which treats the hallucination as a kind\nof monstrous development of some real tract or speck of light, or shade,\nor colour which serves as a .point de repere, a peg on which the subject\nhangs his fancied image. Thus the image will behave just as the\npoint de repere behaves ; that is to say it will follow optical laws, and\nwill be magnified by a real magnifying glass and not by a false one. The\ncommon experiment of the hallucinatory picture recognised on a white\ncard by the aid of some trifling mark exemplifies this view.\nC. A theory which has found few, if any, supporters has been\nadvanced by Professor Lombroso.1 He holds that he has produced by\nsuggestion hallucinatory images of the solar spectrum, which have then\nbeen modified correctly by looking through a glass of some given\n(hallucinatory) colour. The images have thus, he thinks, followed optical\nlaws unknown to the subject, and not suggested by the operator. He\nseems to suppose that this is the result of a high degree of exteriori-\nsation. The experiment should be repeated ; but even if the imaginary\nspectra are more correctly modified than the subject's conscious optical\nknowledge would explain, this need not show more than that the\nsubject's subliminal consciousness was better informed optically than\nhis supraliminal. The subliminal memory is, in my view, much better\nstored than the supraliminal, and from better memory truer inferences\nmay be drawn.\n1 Congres de Psyehologie Physiologique, 1889 : Rapport p. 140.\n2 n 2\n\f448 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nD. My own view, briefly, is that all hallucinations, including the\nhypnotic, are essentially modifications by the subliminal self of the\nsupraliminal field of vision or other sensation ; and that, therefore,\nwe cannot expect hypnotic hallucinations, as such, to follow any\none physiological or psychological law. To understand this, let us look\nround a little among the varieties of hallucination which hypnotic\nsuggestion can produce.\nThe simplest case\u2014the case which we have been assuming thus\nfar\u2014is when the hypnotiser merely suggests to the subject to see some\nobject which is not really present. \" You see that cat,\" he says, and\nthe subject sees a cat; which may be either the definite memory-image\nof some given cat, or an imagination-image of a cat\u2014generalised, of\ncourse, from many cats already seen. Now let us go a step further and\nsuggest something more complex, say a country churchyard. Here\nalso what is seen may be some special remembered churchyard, or an\nimagination-image,\u2014of course quite different in vividness from any\nthing that the waking subject could call up. But here a new point\nrises. The cat could, of course, easily be combined with the actual\nscene, although it necessarily hid some part of that scene. But the\nchurchyard cannot thus be combined ; it must supplant the actual\nscene ; and if we make adroit inquiry we shall find that it supplants\nthat scene in different ways, and with different degrees of completeness,\nin each individual cose. Now suggest a hallucination purely of\nsuppression ;\u2014what has been called a \" negative hallucination,\" or a\n\" systematised anesthesia.\" Say, for instance, that Mr. X has left the\nroom, while he is in reality still present. It will soon be obvious that\nmuch more than a mere optical phenomenon may be here produced.\nClosely linked with the apparent absence of Mr. X from the then\nvisual field, may be a number of hallucinations of other senses,\u2014hearing\nand touch,\u2014which group themselves about the central hallucination\nin such a way as to maintain it with as little interruption as possible.\nI say as little as possible ; for it often happens that some act of the\nartificially invisible personage is marked enough to break the spell.\nBut surely, when the hallucination reaches this degree of com\nplexity, we must recognise that this is no simple, isolated phenomenon.\nBather it is an intelligent adaptation of means to ends. The object is\nto induce and maintain a certain erroneous idea ; and this \" trunk lie,\"\nto use an American term, is bolstered up by sensory deceptions which\nvary from minute to minute according to need. We have here, in\nshort, a continuous modification of the supraliminal field of perception\neffected by the subliminal self.\nThe question as to the optical behaviour of these hallucinatory\nimages will therefore take another form. We must now ask, \" What\nresources does the subliminal self command 1 In what directions is it\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness.\nable to modify the supraliminal outlook t \" At the answer to such\na question we can only guess from observing the more complex\nhallucinatory images, or visions. And we note that such visions fre\nquently fail in conformity to optical laws ;\u2014for lack, if I may so say, of\noptical laws to which they can conform. The crystal-visions, with\nwhich we shall soon deal, will afford various examples of what is at the\nleast a strange optical confusion. I hold, therefore, that the repre\nsentation of a subliminal message in visual terms is a process whose\nrelation to optical laws is uncertain and variable. And, therefore,\nalthough I believe from actual observation that simple hallucinatory\nimages generally conform either to Bernheim's or to Binet's view, I\ncannot accept either view as possessing more than a partial and\nempirical truth.\n3. The nature of the content of these hypnotic hallucinations has\nbeen often discussed in these Proceedings. My readers know that,\nwhereas in the usual view that content depends wholly on suggestion\nby word or sign acting upon the pre-existing ordinary knowledge of\nthe subject, in my view it often manifests knowledge subliminally\nacquired by the subject, either by telepathic transmission from his\nhypnotiser, or by the exercise of independent clairvoyant faculty. And\nit will be seen as we proceed that I claim an equally wide range for\nhallucinations induced by waking experiments.\nV.\u2014But putting aside controverted points, we see that these\nhypnotically suggested hallucinations have already supplied us with\nfacts of deep concern to experimental psychology. Plainly the experi\nment is full of instruction. But we know that experiments are not\napt to present themselves to us at once in their best and simplest\nform. Can we improve on this experiment ? Can we get rid of the\nsuperfluous and intensify the interesting part 1\nWe have been studying the hallucinatory images generated in\nobedience to A's suggestion in the mind of the hypnotised B.\nNow, in the first place, it is no longer interesting to us that A\nshould have any directing voice in starting the images. It is B's\nmind that we want to study, and we would rather leave it undisturbed\nby ordinary verbal suggestion ; although of course we shall be glad to\nobserve telepathic impact, if we can.\nIn the second place it would plainly be more convenient if we\ncould dispense with hypnotisation and get B to see and describe the\nhallucinations in his waking state. But can B get at these subliminal\npictures by any mere effort of will ? Can he do anything more than\nmerely summon up memory-images and combine them in fantastic\nways ? Can he get at anything deeper than vague day-dreams or\nscrappy recollections 1 Let us consider whether, apart from such a\nrare and startling incident as an actual hallucination, there is any\n\f450 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nincident in the course of our ordinary visual imagery which may give\na hint of its possible recall, intensification, or fixation, by some\nlucky artifice.\nAs a general rule the visual impression of any given object gets\nprogressively weaker. Say that I see a painted window with a figure\nof Fortitude. Immediately after its direct perception it may, under\nfavourable circumstances, appear as an after-image. After a few minutes\nit can no longer be recalled as such, but it can be summoned with less\ndistinctness and less apparent objectivity (though often with truer\ncoloration) as a memory-image. As a memory-image it gradually\nbecomes less definite and more generalised. After a time I cease to bo\nable to recall by any effort what the figure on the window was. But\nit still persists as material for imagination-images. If I am called upon\nto sketch a figure of Fortitude, my sketch will probably be influenced\nby the forgotten figure on the window.\nVI.\u2014This gradual effacement of the image is usually treated as\nthough it represented a real dissolution. In my view it is more likely\nto represent a mere subsidence or percolation of the image, so to say,\ninto some subliminal stratum, where it is kept along with all other past\nexperiences of the organism, in a reservoir not generally accessible.\nBut since I believe that what has sunk down as rain-water may be\nforced up again as springs, I shall anticipate that there may be recru\ndescences of decadent images,\u2014suddenly regaining all (or more than\nall) the vividness of an after-image a few seconds old. Nay more,\njust as I know that the rain-fed spring may carry up in its fountain\ntraces of the salts through which the water has flowed in its subter\nranean course, so also I conjecture that these resurgent images may be\nother than exact copies of the original impressions ; that they may\nshow signs of generalisation (I mean a generalisation diagrammatic and\nintelligent rather than vague or blurred), or again of that intermixture\nof imagination, that working up into new combinations, which I con\nceive to be a continuous subliminal process essential to all supraliminal\nexercise of inventive faculty. I will give some instances of these resur\ngent unages, beginning with a remarkable case of postponed or per\nsistent after-images sent to me by Mr. C. M. Bakewell, lately a pupil\nof Professor W. James, who has sent me a concordant account.\nI. The Experiment.\nM. 42. 18, North Weber-street, Colorado Springs, California.\nOn retiring at night I look fixedly at my lamp, or some other conspicuous\nobject, for a few seconds, varying the time according to the brilliancy of the\nobject.\nWith my eyes still fixed on the object, I put out my light, at the same\ntime closing my eyes. I am then careful to keep my eyes closed until I\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 451\nfall asleep, when, presumably, nature keeps them closed for me. If I\nawake in the night I am still careful not to open my eyes.\nOn awaking in the morning I open my eyes on a plain white ceiling,\nand instantly close them again, having just admitted a vague flash of light\ninto the eye.\nII. The Result.\nObserving these rules, I often found that in the morning the light-\nflashed retina would vibrate to the picture which had last occupied it the\nnight before. Or, if this is assuming too much, since an objector might say\nI had not proved that the sensation was not \" centrally initiated \" ;\u2014at least,\nthere would stand the object before my closed eyes in all the vividness of\nobjective reality.\nI will not trouble you with a detailed account of all my experiments, but\nshall mention one which will serve as the type of a class of results, which\nseem to throw doubt on the suggestion that these sensations are \" centrally\ninitiated \" ; and which also seem to differentiate my pictures\u2014which I call\ntardy positive after-images\u2014from the picture which flows in the hypnopompic\ntrain. I quote from my note-book, from the record made the same morning:\u2014\n\"Last evening, when ready for bed, I took hold of my lamp-extinguwher,\nglanced at a frame on my wall containing a number of pictures, immediately\npulled the string of the extinguisher, at the same time closing my eyes. I\nwas careful to keep them closed all the time before going to sleep\u2014not an\neasy matter when I felt I could not open them\u2014and, as I was somewhat\nexcited in anticipation of the picture I was to see in the morning, it took\nlonger than usual to fall asleep. When I awoke day had dawned. I opened\nmy eyes and immediately closed them. To my surprise I saw before me\nthe lamp, and not the picture I was intent on seeing. But the lamp stood\nout clearly\u2014rather an ugly lamp\u2014with its pink shade and pink china base,\nwith flowered pattern in green and white, and with its brass trimmings, just\nas it appears at night when the light is streaming through the shade and\nlighting up the base. Now, in trying to see why this and not the picture\nI was looking for appeared, the obvious explanation occurred to me that as\nI had glanced at the lamp just before looking at the picture, and as the\nlatter was comparatively quite a dark object, my instantaneous glimpse of it\nhad not left a strong enough trace behind to appear in the morning ; nor\nhad it been strong enough to destroy the image which I had got from my\nlamp.\"\nOn several other occasions have I been equally surprised by seeing start\nout before me objects which I was not expecting. But in every such case\nthe pictures seen in the morning have been of objects seen the evening be\nfore, shortly before retiring.\nI am by no means always successful, but the successes when they do come\nare startling in their vividness.\nI am most successful when awaking at or very soon after daybreak.\nOnce, after failing to get my image in the morning, I dozed off, and was\nfortunate enough to awake in the midst of a beautiful \" hypnopompic \" train\nof images ; and, recollecting my failure the same morning to get my tardy\nafter-image, I immediately directed my attention to the object I had then\nbeen expecting\u2014the same lamp mentioned above\u2014and it at once took its\n\f452 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nplace vividly in that train. But this case seems to be of a very different sort\nfrom the others, and meets with a much simpler explanation.\nIII. Corroboration of Experiments by Others.\nThree out of six students of psychology who have faithfully tried the ex\nperiment have been successful.\nProfessor Scott, of Michigan, I am told, has been quite successful. It\nwas, in fact, through learning of his success one time with his pincushion\nthat I was led in the first place to try the experiments.\nIV. Difficulties, Conclusions, &c.\nI have already mentioned the fact that I am by no means always success\nful in getting the morning image even when I have faithfully observed the\nrules of observation. I at first explained this to my own satisfaction by\nsupposing that the tardy positive after-image was a function of (1) the time\nof the original stimulus ; (2) the time elapsing between this stimulus and the\nmorning light-flash ; and (3) the amount of light which had penetrated the\neyelids and had been softly stimulating the retina before I awoke to open\nmy eyes and close them for the expected image. But I have not been able\nto prove this to my own satisfaction.\nAnother difficulty has come up, however, in my discovery that my best\n\u00abuccesses came with my first attempts.\nIt seems as if we have in these morning pictures, secondary or tardy\npositive after-images ; as if, in addition to the first positive after-image\nimmediately arising, there was a feeble series of vibrations, which, if left\nundisturbed by counter-vibrations, gradually by their summation came to be\nof sufficient importance to give a bright positive image, provided any sudden\nuniform stimulation of the retina should set these banked-up energies off.\nIf this be the explanation, we ought to be able to get these images, it\nwould seem, after a shorter interval, with the proper initial stimulus, and the\nproper subsequent light-flash. On this line, too, I hope to carry out my\nexperiments when I have more leisure, and get my room arranged.\nAnother question that arises is, how far are these remnant vibratiuncles\n(if I may be allowed to borrow a word from Hartley) destroyed, or\nneutralised, by such sequent retinal stimulation ? It would seem from my\nexperiments that a certain amount of such stimulation may be received\nwithout preventing the summation of the vibratiuncles.\nIf the explanation above suggested be the true one, we seem to have\nsome light thrown on the problem of crystal-vision (a suggestion which I had\nmade to a friend before hearing from Professor James).\nIt seems to me that these experiments may also throw some light on the\nquestion of dream imagery, but I shall not trespass further on your time.\nChas. M. Bakewell.\nMr. Bakewell's experience, which shows us after-images of an unparalleled\npersistence, and a rarely paralleled definiteness of coloration, suggests an\nexplanation for a special group of ghost stories (which we have never regarded\nas evidential), where a face seen overnight in a picture presents itself\nduring the night as an apparition. The following narrative, illustrating\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 453\nthis class of hallucinations possibly reducible to mere after-images, was sent\nto us by the Rev. A. Horsbrugh (Bengal chaplain retired), of Granville-\nterrace, Edinburgh :\nApril 16th, 1891.\nIn September, 1888, I was staying in a farmhouse in the Kyles of Bute.\nMy friend and I were out sailing, and were becalmed and much delayed on\nour homeward run. We did not get in till 12 p.m. After eating a hearty\nsupper we turned in for the night. My bed was one of those old-fashioned,\nheavily-curtained beds often seen in the Highlands. Being tired, I soon fell\nasleep. About 2 a.m. I awoke with the feeling that someone was looking\nat me, and for the space, say, of 10 to 15 seconds I distinctly saw a face\ngazing at me from the opening in the curtains. It was a face I had never seen\nbefore. My hair stood up on my head, and I felt cold ; but reason prevailed as\nI thought of my late and heavy supper, and soon again I was fast asleep. In\nthe morning the first thing I saw was a miniature portrait of the face I had\nseen hanging over the mantelpiece. On making inquiry, I heard that this\nman had lived in the house and died in that room, but this event had occurred\nso long since that this information was second-hand from hearsay. My theory\naccounting for this supposed apparition is this : that one of the last things I\nsaw before turning in was the small portrait, which, as it were, remained\nphotographed on my retina, and the disordered digestion did the rest.\nLewis C. Bkuce.\nVII.\u2014The distinction between after-images and memory-images,\nalthough sometimes neglected by careless writers, is a marked one ;\nsince after-images, properly so called, are a form of entoptic vision, due\nto the actual condition of the retina at the moment ; while memory-\nimages are a form of that \" mind's-eye \" vision (central, cerebral,\ninternal, subjective) which lacks as yet a recognised scientific name.\nNevertheless, a transitional phenomenon is found in illusions hypna-\ngogiques, the vivid pictures (already so often mentioned here) which\nwith many persons rise before the \" inward eye \" at the moment of\nfalling asleep, or even in waking hours. These may closely resemble\npostponed after-images ; or again, they may assume the more generalised\ncharacter of memory-images ; or (and this perhaps is the commonest\ncase) they may show combinations as novel and fantastic as any which\ndeliberate imagination could summon up. A good example of this\ntransition from afterimages to memory-images is afforded by the\nfollowing careful account, which I owe to the kindness of Dr. Th.\nFlournoy, Professor of Philosophy in the University of Geneva :\nM. 43. August, 1892.\nAlthough not habitually subject to hypnagogic hallucinations, I have\nexperienced some ten or twelve, of the visual type, and concerned with\nobjects which had engaged my prolonged attention during the day.\nIn 1875, after my first day of anatomical dissection, I had the hallucina\ntion of an aponeurosis, spread out widely. In 1879, after a long afternoon\nspent at chess, the vision of a chessboard came to me before I went to sleep.\n\f454 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nSeveral times in 1878, after a day of microscopical work, the image of a\npreparation came before me as a hypnagogic hallucination. These three\ncases struck me forcibly, because at that date I had never heard any mention\nof such phenomena. Since then I have had a few more experiences, under\nthe following conditions :\u2014\n(1) When after a long interval I occupy myself earnestly with some\ngiven subject I see that evening a corresponding hypnagogic hallucination ;\n\u2014as of chessboard, geometrical figures, microscopical preparation ;\u2014which\ndoes not repeat itself if I continue to attend to the same matter on subsequent\ndays. (2) But, on the other hand, I sometimes see in the daytime, two or\nthree days later, a very distinct image of the object in question. This image\ndoes not amount to a hallucination ;\u2014it is not externalised, nor is it as vivid\nas a perception ;\u2014but, as I am a very bad visualiser, this vivid and precise\nimage is broadly distinguished from my habitual images, which are weak,\nfragmentary, and indistinct. (3) Neither the hypnagogic image nor the\ndiurnal image are exact reproductions of the given object at a given\nmoment. They are typical images of aponeurosis or chessboard\u2014not re\nproductions of some specific aspect which has strongly impressed me. Yet\nthey are concrete and precise.\nI regard these hypnagogic images, and all memory-images, however\nrecent and intense, as radically different from the \"after-images\" of the eye.\nThese last have a quality sui rjeneris, a \"sensational co-efficient\" which\nmakes them seem to me to exist outside me, if I see them with open eyes ;\nor to belong to my eye, as though stuck inside my eyelid, if I see them with\neyes closed. All other images seem to me to be seen with the mind's eye. I\nclass after-images with external perceptions ; all other images, whether as\nvivid as my hypnagogic hallucinations or as faint as the ordinary visual furni\nture of my mind, I place in a quite different category.\nIn this case two points, on which I have already dwelt, come clearly\nout :\u2014namely, (1) the resurgence of a decadent image with something\nlike its original brilliancy ; (2) the process of generalisation which this\nimage has subliminally undergone. There are other well-known\ninstances of the same kind : Newton and the spectrum ; Baillarger and\nthe gauze which he had been using in anatomical preparations ; Pouchet\nand the microscopical objects.1 In all these cases the resurgent images\nappear to have been of a generalised type,\u2014but generalised, so to say,\ndiagrammatically, not blurred or uncertain, but as one would prepare\nthem for a demonstration.2 For this reason it is certainly better not to\ni See W. James's Principles of Psychology, Vol. II., p. 66, &c. ; Binet's La\nPsychologic du Raisonnement, p. 48, &c\n2 It is probable that something of the same kind takes place in hypnotic hallucin\nation3, where, say, a dog seen by suggestion is not necessarily any special remembered\ndog. On the other hand if the order is to see some special object, it will be seen more\naccuiately than it is remembered ;\u2014as is curiously illustrated by the frequent dis\nsatisfaction of a female subject when told to see her own portrait on a blank card.\nThe idealised memory-picture, which modifies even her perception of her own image\nin the looking-glass, is ruthlessly displaced by the subliminal fidelity to truth. \" J'ai\nbien des taches de rousseur,\" said a subject of Binet's, \" mais je n'en ai pas tant que ca.\"\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 455\nclass them as \" after-images,\" reserving that term for cases of purely\nphysiological reproduction of external images. And in fact we find\nthat these hallucinations hypnagogiques depart further and further\nfrom mere reproductions of objects seen. They assume all kinds of\ngrotesque forms, and show remarkable inventiveness in producing\nhundreds of faces which the percipient has never seen before.\nSimilarly the patterns seen by Sir John Herschell in waking life\n(Proceedings, Vol.VIII., p. 347), were neither after-images nor memory-\nimages. They were of the same general type as illusions hypnagogiques,\nalthough so far surpassing (so to say) in initial energy these half-asleep\npictures that they forced themselves upwards through the waking\nthoughts of one of the most alert of recorded minds.\nWe may indeed say more generally that whenever a perception\nsinks ever so little below the threshold, and reappears, it is liable to\nreappear in a generalised or symbolic form. A little anecdote of M.\nBinet's (PsychoJogie du Haisonneinent, p. 12) may serve to illustrate\nhow very slight a dip into the subliminal is enough to metamorphose\na very commonplace perception. A friend of M. Binet's, Dr. A., was\nwalking along a Paris street, his mind full of an examination in botany\nwhich he was about to undergo. Suddenly he noticed on the glass\ndoor of a restaurant the words verbascum thapsus. Astonished at\nthis inscription, he turned back and read the real word\u2014bouillon.\nNow the popular French name for the plant verbascum or mullein is\n\" bouillon blanc.\" The inscription had, then, been first observed (in my\nphraseology) by the subliminal and not by the supraliminal self, and in\nits short plunge had become infected, so to say, with that incoherent or\naccidental association which is the basis of a \"play upon words.\"\nExactly the same process, of course, is frequently observable in\ndreams.\nVIII.\u2014But I need not further multiply instances. Enough has been\nsaid to show that in ordinary life, and under conditions falling far short\nof definite hallucination, there is a storehouse of imagery just below the\nthreshold of consciousness, from which pictures rise on slight provoca\ntion into the field of vision of the inward eye. What we need is to\nsystematise such insurgences ; to hit upon some empirical process which\nwill enable us to get at subliminal pictures whenever we will. And we\nwant not only to summon them up, but to keep them steady ;\u2014to\nexternalise them as far as we can, that we may study them at our\nleisure.\nLet us look round, then, for any mode in which mental imagery has\nbeen observed to attain to externalisation. And here I speak only of\nvisual externalisation ; not of the motor externalisation observed by\nFere' and others, when exciting inward ideas are accompanied by a\nmore forcible grip of the dynamometer.\n\f45G Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nIt is probable that many imperfect externalisations have passed\nunnoticed, since this whole group of subjects has but recently received\nattention. Thus, for instance, we are all aware of a certain forward\ndirection of our inward images in the act of attention. And since Mr.\nGalton's well-known work we have become familiar with \"number-forms \"\nand other visual schemata of thought, which tend to shape themselves\nin many minds. These number-forms involve a complex internalvisualisa\ntion, the mind's eye following their apparently fixed lines and angles ;\nbut I do not remember to have heard till now of their being external\nised by the subject. Professor Flournoy, however, has recently\ndescribed the case of M. Yowanovitch, an intelligent student at\nGeneva.'\nM. 44.\n\"M. Y. is an excellent visual, of the geometrical rather than the\npicturesque type. He has no trace of coloured audition ; but on the other\nhand possesses well denned and localised visual schemata for the numerals,\nthe days of the week, the months, &c. His number-form, composed of\nparallel lines representing the hundreds, occupies the right half of the space\nin front of him. In the left half floats his diagram of the week in the form\nof a horizontal rectangular figure divided into seven bands, something like a\nleaf of ruled paper, floating in the air about a metre from him, opposite his\nleft thigh. Still more to the left, and at the height of his head, is situated\nhis year-form, an ellipse of small eccentricity presented in a nearly vertical\nplane. Whenever M. Y. thinks of a date of the year, of a day past or\nfuture of the current week, or of a number, he perceives it in its proper place\non the corresponding schema. I have often had occasion to make him write\ndown rapidly a series of figures at random ; now these figures do not flow\nof themselves from his pen ; nor are they preceded in him by their auditory,\nmotor, or graphic image ; but he is obliged, in order to write them, to choose\nthem on his number-form as on a picture placed in front of him. For this\npurpose, he does not look straight at the page over which his pen is travel-\nling, but looks to the side and above the paper in the direction of the internal\ndiagram, which is the central object of his attention. He follows what he is\nwriting only with an indirect vision, like a hurried copyist who lets his hand\nwork of itself and will not lose sight of the page which he has to copy.\"\nIt will be observed that this case presents a curious analogy wTith\nthe \"arithmetical prodigies\" on whom I dwelt in Proceedings, XVII.\nWith some of them there was a kind of mental blackboard on which\nthe figures which were to be added up remained visible as long as\nneeded. But in their case the subliminal self supplied also the calcu\nlating facility ; in M. Y.'s case it seems only to have stereotyped the\nvisual framework for common mental operations.\nIX.\u2014We take one step further in the direction both of the definite\ni Archivet da Sciences Physiques el Naturcllcs, Vol. XXVIII., No. 10, October\nloth, 1892, pp. 326-7. Geneva.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 45T\ncharacter and of the potential externalisation of these subliminal\nquasi-percepts when we pass\u2014by gradual transitions\u2014from number-\nforms to audition colorfa. A number-form is an association of an image\nwith an idea,\u2014presumably as entirely a result of post-natal experience\nas is my association of my friend's face with his name. And so also,\nindeed audition coloree,\u2014the perception of a definite \" imaginary \" or\n\" subjective \" colour in association with each definite actual sound,\u2014\nmay in some slighter cases be due to post-natal (mainly infantile)\nexperience working upon an innate predisposition. But when the\nsymesthesiie of which sound-seeing is only the most conspicuous example\nare found in fuller development ;\u2014when gradated, peremptory, inexplic\nable associations connect sensations of light and colour with sensations,\nof temperature, smell, taste, muscular resistance, kc, kc. ;\u2014for M.\nGruber finds that these links exist in yet unexplored variety ;\u2014then\nit becomes probable that we are dealing, not with the casual asso\nciations of childish experience, but with some reflection or irradiation\nof specialised sensations which must depend on the connate structure\nof the brain itself.' And the degree of precision shown in these\nentencephalic reflexes,\u2014if I may so term them,\u2014 seems to exceed the\nprecision attainable by the voluntary attention of the supraliminal self.\nI must here confine myself to an allusion to one striking case, com\nbining both the subliminal intelligence and the visual externalisation,\nwhich was described by Professor Gruber, of the University of Jassy,,\nRoumania, at the recent International Congress of Experimental\nPsychology in London, August, 1892. In one self-observer of excep\ntional endowment, M. Gruber finds that the \"chromatisms,\" as he calls\nthem,\u2014the patches of colour accompanying the audition of particular\nwords,\u2014follow certain definite rules as to size and shape, depending\npartly on the phonetic, and partly on the intellectual, significance of\nthe word which the subject heard. This curious fact (whose details\nI must not here give) would obviously have remained unprovable had\nthere been no possibility of objective measurement. But this possibility\nfortunately exists.\n\"My subject,\" says M. Gruber, \"has the power of externalising his\nchromatisuts ; he projects them, for instance, upon the opposite wall, at no.\nmatter what distance. I chose a distance of three metres, which is that at\nwhich his vision is most distinct. I then made a circle of white paper which\nI supposed to be of the same size as his chromatism of the number dol (two),\nand bordered it with bright scarlet. He projected his chromatism into this\n' This view is consistent with the results of an Enqulte tur faudition colorie-\nrecently conducted by Professor Klournoy, from which it appears that of 213 persons\npresenting these associations only 48 could assign the date of their origin ; and is.\nsupported by a case described in the Revue de VHypnotitmc, December, 1892, p. 185,\nwhere a man who had long exhibited a limited form of audition coloree developed\ngustation eoloric in addition when in a low state of health.\n\f458 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ncircle. But the circle was, in fact, smaller than his chromatic circle, and a\nring of orange was made by the superposition of the subjective yellow of his\n\u2022chromatism upon the objective scarlet. I enlarged the circle. This time he\nsaw a white ring between the objective frame of scarlet and the subjective\nyellow. At last we got the edges of the chromatism to touch precisely the\nedges of the white circle. We had found the exact size of the chromatism\nand could now measure it to a millimetre.\"\nThe foregoing passage will show how clearly denned these ent\u00abn-\ncephalic percepts may be. It is sometimes possible also to show that they\nrepresent (as I should expect them to represent) a memory more com\nplete and a perception more exact than the supraliminal self can\ncommand. Thus, Mr. Galton had already mentioned a case where a\nlady used her chromatisms to correct her spelling\u2014the chromatism\nshowing, say, whether or not there were two o's in agreeable, and\ncorrecting her supraliminal picture of the word by the symbolic coloured\nequivalent of each successive letter which thus rose from a memory\ndeeper in her being. At the recent Congress of Experimental\nPsychology, Mr. Galton mentioned Lepsius the Orientalist as having\nbeen similarly guided in philological investigation. And one of M.\nGruber's subjects, a professional singer, when taught to analyse his own\nchromatisms, found that they corrected his ear in singing ; so that if he\nsang a false note without detecting it by ear the accompanying patch\nof colour showed him his mistake.'\nX.\u2014I have cited these instances of quasi-externalisation of sub-\nliminally initiated images in order to show that w*e might have\ngradually reached the mode of experiment on which I am about to dwell\nat length, namely \" crystal-vision \"\u2014or \" speculation \" in a narrow\nprimary sense\u2014by an unexceptionable and orthodox road. As a matter\nof fact I personally was led to it by a kind of short cut, permissible\nenough, I think, when one is groping about for some empirical process\nwhich may help one over a purely experimental difficulty to a result\nwhich ought logically to be possible. The object was to get our sub\nliminal mental pictures externalised for supraliminal study ; in other\nwords, to induce harmless and manageable hallucinations. But little\nacquaintance with the history of superstition was enough to suggest\nthat in many ages and countries some form of crystallomancy, or\nspecular gazing, had been practised as a main method of divination.\n1 This curious case may be compared with that of Pedrono, cited by Dr. Krohn,\nin his useful historical sketch of \" Pseudo-Chromesthesia,\" American Journal of\nPsticholotii\/, Vol. V., Part I., p. 25 : \"These colour impressions he describes as sudden\nand spontaneous. The sounds are translated into colour before he can stop to think\nwhether the voice is high or low.\" In other experiments it has been found that the\ncolour was seen before the meaning of the word which determined the colour was con\nsciously observed.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 459\n\u2022Of this fact, Miss X has set forth abundant evidence in her paper,\n.\" On Recent Experiments in Crystal-Vision,\" in Proceedings, Vol. V.,\np. 48G.\nI will add an example from Icelandic Saga, as represented by\n'William Morris, in his Story of Sigurd the Volsung. Sigurd consults\nthe sage Gripir as to the fates to be.\nNought answered the ancient wise-one, and not a whit had he stirred\nSince the clash of Sigurd's raiment in his mountain hall he heard ;\nBut the ball that imaged the earth was set in his hand grown old ;\nAnd belike it was to his vision, as the wide-world's ocean rolled,\nAnd the forests waved with the wind, and the corn was gay with the lark,\nAnd the gold in its nether places grew up in the dusk and the dark,\nAnd its children built and departed, and its King-folk conquered and went,\nAs over the crystal image his all-wise face was bent :\nFor all his desire was dead ; and he lived as a God shall live,\n'Who the prayers of the world hath forgotten, and to whom no hand may give.\nIt is, then, this \" crystal-vision,\" or steady gaze into any speculum\nor clear depth, which I recommend as an empirical method of inducing\nharmless and easily observable hallucinations. Here, as in the parallel\ncase of the motor phenomena of automatic script, we must begin by\nassuring ourselves that we are not dealing with a mere exaggeration\nof vague subjective sensations. As with automatic writing, so here,\nwe can soon prove this by experiments on known hypnotised subjects.\nIt will be found that a subject who is told when asleep that he will\n.see a given scene, and who is then awakened and told to look in a glass\nof water or a crystal, will see the suggested scene depicted in action,\nwhile his waking self remains quite ignorant of its purport. Such\nexperiments are obviously a mere development of the ordinary\ncommand to see a photographic picture on a blank card, &c. But at\nthe same time they lead on directly to my cases of crystal-vision in the\nnormal state. It seems useful, therefore, to quote some notes of experi\nments made by me with two of the subjects with whom the late Edmund\nGurney and Mrs. Sidgwick have worked so long.\nM. 45.\nExperiments made at Brighton, March 9th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 1891.\nExtract from account written out after the experiments from notes made\nat the time, with some comments added later.\nMarch 9th. Present, G. A. Smith and the two subjects, P. and T.\n1. I began with repeating the experiment already frequently made with\nthese and other subjects, viz., suggesting to the hypnotised P. that he would\nsee a given picture on a card when awakened. [G. A. S. hypnotised and\nawoke the subjects throughout.] I told P. that on awaking he would be\nshown a card with a picture of a baby on it. I said the one word \" baby \"\nwithout detail in order to see how his mind developed the idea. He was\nshown a blank card and saw, not a veritable baby, but a child of six.\n\f4G0 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n' 2. Next time I suggested a hippopotamus\u2014an animal which P. had never\nseen in the flesh. On being awakened he saw on the card what he called a\nrhinoceros. He complained that it was rather indistinct ; he was not sure\nwhether it had horns or tusks. There is a certain interest in this as indica\nting that the hallucination was founded upon a mental picture suggested by\nmy words, rather than on the words themselves. One might have supposed\nthat, since my whole suggestion consisted of the word hippopotamus, the\nawakened subject, however vaguely he saw the beast, would have known\nthat it was meant for a hippopotamus. But the picture, vague as it was,\nseemed to be more communicable from the hypnotic to the supraliminal self\nthan the word which had originally generated it. A picture was what had\nbeen ordered, and a picture came.\n3. I repeated this form of experiment once more, telling P. that he would\nsee a picture of T. ; which he saw clearly.\n4. I next determined to try the effect of a glass of water, arranged as a\nspeculum, in giving additional vividness to these post-hypnotic pictures. I\nsuggested to each young man separately a different scene, and then set them\nto gaze into the same glass of water, behind which I placed a dark back\nground. T. had once looked into ink : but beyond this neither of them\nknew anything of crystal-gazing, and they were told that they were to see an\noptical illusion of my invention. They naturally assumed that they would\nboth equally see whatever there was to be seen.\nI told P. (hypnotised) that the electric light on the Eastbourne Parade\nhad gone out on the previous evening, but had been relighted in a few\nminutes.\nI told T. (hypnotised) that at Barnum's Circus there was a race of ponies\nwith monkeys on their backs.\nP., though generally the better seer of hallucinatory pictures, began\n(when awakened and set before the glass of water) by saying that all was\nquite black.\nT. said : \" Look, there's something going round and round in the\nwater ! \"\nP. : \" It's your fancy ; it's all dark.\"\nT. : \" No, it's horses\u2014they're horses going round and round\u2014they've\ngot something small on their backs, not so big as those girls who jump\nthrough hoops. It's like a circus.\"\nSuddenly P. looked sharply up at me as though to see what I was doing.\n\"What have you done with the light ? \" he said ; \" you've made a great ball\nof light in the glass, like a round thing with a light in the middle of it. \" He\ndid not see the meaning of this ; but it appeared that he had begun with\nsimply a vision of darkness, and then had seen the electric light rekindled.\nThis was not the way in which I had conceived my picture\u2014(I had thought\nof the look of the long Parade and a line of lamps going out)\u2014but it gave\nthe essential point.\nIt will bo observed that in this experiment, as in that of the hippopota\nmus, and in most of those that follow, neither percipient recognised the full\nmeaning of the picture seen. The undistinguished '' small things \" in T. 's\npicture were, of course, the monkeys of my story. I shall recount later on\nsome attempts to make similar obscure details clear by magnification. Both\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 461\n\u00ab true and a pretended or suggested magnifying-glass should be tried with\nmany subjects under such conditions as these.\n5. I next told P. (hypnotised) the story of Robinson Crusoe finding the\nfootprint and fearing savages.\nI told T. that Moses Primrose took a cow to the fair and returned with\na gross of green spectacles, to the derision of his family.\nAwakened and set before the glass of water, P. at once exclaimed :\n\" Why, there's Buffalo Bill ! He's dressed in feathers, and skins round him ;\nalmost like a savage. He's walking about in a waste place.\" T. : \"Is ho\nleading a cow along ?\" P. : \" No, no, he's all alone.\" T. : \" That's a cow,\nnot Buffalo Bill.\" P. : \"I can see something else coming from another\npart,\u2014it's a blackie.\" T. : \"No, it's a sack, a sack on his back.\" P. :\n\" Look at them now, how they're arguing ! Buffalo Bill and his black man.\"\nT. : \"J can see them arguing now\u2014he's got into a house\u2014there's four of\nthem.\" P. : \"No, no, only two.\" T. : \" No, four,\u2014look at them roaring ! \"\n(i.e., with laughter). P. : \"No, they're behind some trees.\" T. : \"They're\ncrying now.\"\nObserve that in P.'s case the footmurk, which was the point on which I\nhad chiefly dwelt, was not observed ; although I suspect, from P.'s insistence\non the long pacing about of his Buffalo Bill, that the footmark was in some\nsense intended to form part of the picture, although too small to be noticed\nby an observer not aware of its importance. P. had read Itobinsmt Crusoe ;\nbut Buffalo Bill was plainly fresher in his memory.\nT. saw no meaning in his story whatever. He did not know what was in\nthe sack\u2014(a detail of his own adding, as I had not clearly conceived how\nthe spectacles were brought home)\u2014and he saw no reason for the laughter\nor weeping. The crging was added from his hypnotic self's own conception\nof the probable effect of such a bargain upon the family, after their first\namusement. T. had never read the Vicar of Wakefield.\n6. Observing the attempts made by the two seers to harmonise these\ndivergent stories, I chose two scenes which had a certain similarity, to see\nwhether either seer would be able to persuade the other to accept his version\nof what was going on.\nI told P. briefly that Banquo's ghost had appeared to Macbeth, his\nmurderer, as he sat with warriors and nobles round him at a feast.\nI told T. (what he already knew to have happened) that at the North\nKilkenny election Mr. Parnell, while addressing the crowd, received a bag\nof lime in his face from a political opponent. Thus each scene had its\ncentral and commanding figure ; I wished to see if the two could be\ncombined.\nP. : \"I see two or three men standing\u2014some sitting\u2014one in a chair\non a raised place, like where the head man sits. That's the Mayor, I sup\npose.\" [P. is more familiar with municipal government than with military\nor Imperial rule.]\nT. : \" Why, there are a whole lot of men\u2014a town\u2014a lot of cars\u2014not\nlike our carriages.\"\nP. (with a loud whistle): \" Oh, here he comes, the bogey -man!'\n(apparently quoting a song).\n2 I\n\f462 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nT. : \"There he is standing up in the middle of them;\u2014I've seen the\nman at Brighton.\"\nP. : \" Look at that chap in the corner ! isn't he frightened of him ? The\nMayor's quite upset.\"\nT. : \"I know the man well enough ; he has a beard\u2014about my height.\nI've seen him walk up and down the front (the Parade) with two dogs after\nhim.\"\nP. : \" He's a g)wst ! \"\nT. : \"He's no ghost, I say ; he's talking to them ; look at that stuff all\ngone into his face ; now three or four men are up talking ; they've got\nsome sticks\u2014there's a row.\"\nP. (imitating conventional ghostly action): \"Look at him! They all\nstick their swords through him\u2014it doesn't hurt him ; he's a ghost ! \"\nT. : \"Nonsense ; how can he be a ghost? I tell you I've spoken to him\nin the [telegraph] office ; he's a man anyone would remember\u2014a stand-ofF\nman. He's all white now ; they're all running.\" \" Was his name Parnell ? \"\nI asked. \"Yes, yes,\" said T., \" Parnell, of course.\" Here also, it will be\nobserved, as in the case of the hippopotamus, it was the picture framed by\nthe percipient's subliminal self, not the mere name as uttered by me, which\nwas transmitted to his supraliminal consciousness.\nThese scenes excited the seers ; and there was some absurdity in their\nendeavours to imitate, and to conciliate, the attitudes of hovering ghost and\nimpassioned orator.\n7. March 26th, 1891. Magnification.\nI told T. (hypnotised) that he would see in the crystal (a real one) a play\nbill of Jael; Sheppard, which had recently been acted in Brighton, the\nlarge print distinct, but not the small print. Awakened, he saw a girl in\nman's clothes\u2014something like knickerbockers\u2014could make out JCK T H.\nOn looking through a (real) magnifying-glass he easily read JACK SHEP\nPARD, THEATRE ROYAL, and recognised that the knickerbockers were\njack-boots. He said that the letters persisted, but were clearer when the\nmagnifier was applied to the crystal. The picture seen was remembered\nfrom an actual poster.\n8. Forgotten Memories.\u2014T. was told (same conditions) that he would see\nscenes of his past life. He was greatly interested by seeing a number of old\nschoolfellows sitting in his old school ; some whom he could not identity ;\nsome of whom he had scarcely thought since he left school. On being re-\nhypnotised he did not remember seeing these pictures\u2014 only remembered\nmy talking to him about his boyhood. We could not therefore get the\nhypnotic self to identify the unknown boys.\n9. March 27th. Test of disappearance from waking memory of words\nspoken to hypnotised subject. \u2014I offered each subject \u00a310 if he could explain\nto me the next picture which he saw. It was plainly necessary to choose\nsome scenes whose meaning they could not yuess, if my description, given\nto them when hypnotised, was forgotten on awaking. I told P. of the\nFinding of Brynhild, and T. of the Niblungs' Need. Each saw his picture\nwell, (Greyfell, the flickering flame-wall, the Sleepful Thorn, &c.,) but was\ncompletely puzzled as to its meaning.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness, 463\n10. March 28th. Magnification.\u2014I tokl T. (hypnotised) that when\nawakened he would see a telegraph form (he is a telegraphist) in a glass of\nwater ; that he would not bo able to make out the words, but only to count\nthem ; then with a magnifier would make them out. Awakened, he saw a\ntelegraph form so bent that he could only see a fragment of a message, con\ntaining seven words which he could not read. Looking in the glass he made\nout \" Met\u2014B'ton (abbreviation used for Brighton) Hotel\u2014come.\" We\ncannot say whether a coherent message in any sense underlay this frag\nmentary attempt at communication.\n11. I now resolved to supply the message myself (same conditions), and\ntold him that he would be able to see the lengths of the words with the naked\neye, and to read them with the magnifier. The telegram was to be [To]\n\" Myers, Cambridge\u2014Oxford won by half a length. Harris.\" With the\nnaked eye he could see that there were only two words in the address, tht\nsecond rather long. With the magnifier he gradually picked out letters\nhere and there\u2014saw the capital letters right, partly saw and partly guessed\nmy name\u2014could not make out the message. Experiments such as this\nshow, I think, that there is some appropriateness in speaking of messayes\nor communications from one to another stratum of the Self. Judging from\nthe analogy of many other post-hypnotic suggestions with the same subject,\nwe can hardly doubt that the whole of this simple telegram was remembered\nby the hypnotic self, and could have been reproduced in obedience to a direct\norder. But the order was to reproduce it with a certain degree of obscurity ;\nand that obscurity turned out to be slightly greater than the magnifying-glass\n(however acting) could overcome. The suggestion was thus slightly too com\nplex ; but, although never fully delivered, the \"inter-state \" or \" methectic \"\nmessage\u2014call it as you will, but let us have some name for it\u2014was ready\nmade up, and waiting to be transmitted from the hypnotic to the supra\nliminal self.\n12. The experiments thus far described, although presenting some novel\npoints, have been such as any observer with good hypnotic subjects at his\ndisposal will probably he able to repeat. Those to which I now come involve\nthe rarer phenomenon of thought-transference, which cannot be guaranteed,\nin the case of any hypnotic subject, although it would doubtless be oftener\nfound if it were oftener looked for. The evidence for Mr. G. A. Smith's\n\"power of transmitting ideas, without the use of ordinary means, to the minds\nof these and other subjects has been so often discussed in these Proceedings\nthat I need here only remark that in all these experiments a close watch\nwas kept by Dr. Dill or myself, or both of us, to guard against indications\n(which, of course, may be quite involuntarily given), while at the same time\nthe picture to be discerned in the crystal involved conceptions more com\nplicated than a mere card-name or number. I omit the first of these ex\nperiments, which was successful, but during which I left the room to speak\nto Dr. J. Gordon Dill, a physician who had previously assisted in similar\nexperiments, and who kindly consented to help mo in those, in which it is\nnaturally desirable to have two observers. In each case Dr. Dill or 1 wrote\ndown the desired picture carefully on a piece of paper out of sight of the\nsubject and showed it to Mr. G. A. Smith, while the subject was entranced\n(in the last two experiments after he was awakened). Mr. G. A. Smith then,\n2 i 2\n\fMr. F. W. H. Myers.\nstood at some distance from the percipient, and out of his sight, while the\npercipient fixed his eyes on the glass of water, and made remarks to which\n(unless otherwise stated) no one replied. Dr. Dill watched Mr. Smith, and I\nwatched the percipient, or vice rersa. Such precautions imply no distrust of\ncither agent or percipient, hut should he taken as a matter of course in all\nexperiments of this kind. Were I myself acting as agent I should prefer to\nhe watched, since no one can be absolutely certain as to what sounds or\nmovements he may unconsciously make. If it is once for all assumed that\nthe human organism, when used in experiments which do not in themselves\npresent any means of eliminating the \" personal equation,\" needs some other\neye to guard against possible idiosyncrasies which may confuse the experi\nments, then such supervision may be submitted to with no more sense of\ndiscredit than the astronomer feels when his individual observations are\naccepted not as absolute truth, but as data to be corrected in a special recog\nnised way. I wrote down \"Two cats fighting,\" and showed the paper care\nfully to Dr. Dill and Mr. Smith \u2014whom I will call D. and S. T. (in waking\nstate) at once saw \"two cats\u2014both with their backs up\u2014fighting, one black\nand striped, the other with patches of white.\" \"Where are the cats?\"\n\"On a wall.\" S. had mentally reproduced a picture of two cats fighting,\ndone in whitewash on a wall\u2014so that his cats were both white. During\nthis experiment D. left the room for a few minutes : I watched T., whose\neyes, as I believe, never left the glass of water.\n13. Next time both subjects (hypnotised and awakened as usual) were to\nsee in the same water-glass the same theme, written down by D. and shown to\nS. and myself : \" Boat putting off from beach.\" P. saw nothing. T. saw \"A\nroom cleared for dancing, the gas-branches wreathed with flowers.\" This\nappeared to be a deferred picture belonging to a previous series. He had\nbeen told, in an experiment which I have omitted, to see four scenes of his\npast life, at different ages. He had seen three, and this scene was probably\nenough the fourth, which was to be typical of his adolescence. At any rate,\nhe was simply hypnotised again, and again awakened (D. and I watching\nthroughout). On reawaking he said : \"There are boats\u2014several steamers and\ntwo boats rowing in front, like a picture of a boat-race in the Graphic.\"\nThis was an approximation to the desired picture.\n14. In the next experiment (same conditions) the theme, written down by\nme, which S. was mentally to suggest, was \" acrobats swinging from trapeze.\"\nNeither P. nor T. saw anything at first. They were rehypnotised and re\nawakened. P. sees a man. T. sees nothing. P. : \"He has got something round\non his hand like a sailor with a life-buoy, and a rope hanging from his hand.\"\nT. : \" I imagine that I see the same thing.\" P. : \"I believe he's standing on a\nvessel\u2014on the deck of a boat\u2014now he's still there but the vessel's gone\u2014you\ncan only see his feet and nothing beneath him.\" T. : \"He looks to me like\na half-photograph.\" T. then had to leave. We told P. to put himself into\nthe man's attitude. The pose assumed was just that of a man who has lifted\nhimself half over his trapeze, the rope which P. saw being across his body,\njust about where the trapeze's seat (of rope or wood) would come. Such a\npicture would also correspond to T.'s \"half [length] photograph.\"\n15. Same conditions. I chose the subject, \" a house on fire.\" This time\nboth D. and I watched P and S., who stood behind P. (of course not in con\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 4G5\ntact), looking at the Limp, and imagining (as he afterwards told us) a great\nsquare of flame. P. : \"I see something like a bright light ; there's a ladder\nup at the window\u2014a house on fire\u2014no doubt about it.\"\n16. Same conditions. Subject written down by D. : \"Mr. Gladstone.\" P. :\n\" I think I see something like a man\u2014a man's head\u2014comes and goes in a\nflash. I know, it's Gladstone, a photograph\u2014head and shoulders.\" Here I\nhad to leave, but Dr. Dill continued the experiments. I now quote his\naccount. Mrs. G. A. Smith was now present, but was not informed of the\nscene.\n17. [Same conditions.] \"Jack the Ripper committing a murder.\"\n[Subject written down by D.] P. : \" I can see something now\u2014it's a man\u2014\nrather faint. Very awful-looking man. Nothing like Gladstone. Repulsive\nand dirty looking. Has something in his hand\u2014it's a knife. Good gracious !\nwhat a terrible looking man\u2014in rags\u2014with his hat coming over his eyes\u2014\nlooks like a murderer.\" D. : \" Is anyone with him?\" P. : \"No, he's\nalone.\" Presently: \"Yes, he is talking to someone\u2014another man. No,\nit's a woman.\" [A few more details are seen and P. recognises the murderer.]\n18. Same conditions. \" St. Georgeaud the Dragon.\" P. : \" Oh I can see\nwhat that is\u2014it's a picture of St. George and the Dragon. The usual picture.\nNot moving, simply a picture.\"\n19. Here P., as D. tells mo in a letter, became anxious to go ofl to catch\na train, a preoccupation which generally interfered with success. On this\nand the next occasion S. was not shown the theme until after P. had been\nawakened. [He was hypnotised, as already stated, between each experiment.]\nSubject: \"A pantomime\u2014clown and policeman on stage. P. . 'I see\nsomething like a lion, I think. Can't tell what it is till it comes closer. Quite\ngone. Saw something like a man in a white hat\u2014gone\u2014looks like one\nof the circus clowns\u2014very smudgy, with a mist in front of it.\" Then\nabout 15 minutes during which he saw nothing. Then \"The clown again !\nbut I lose sight of him when he moves.\"\n20. Subject : \" A photograph of Mr. Myers.\" [This time S. opened and\nread the paper designating the desired picture downstairs, and did not enter\nthe room. P. saw the beach\u2014boats\u2014nothing.]\nXI.\u2014I have thought it worth while to record these experiments at\nsome length, because they seem to me to illustrate the gradual transition\nbetween the common forms of post-hypnotic hallucination, which,\nhowever surprising at first, are now undisputed, and the crystal-vision\nwhich I am anxious to present as no \" occult practice \" or superstitious\nfancy, but as the empirical development of processes more familiar but\nquite equally empirical.\nBut, indeed, as with automatic script, so here also we shall soon\nfind that hypnotic experiments of this kind are not necessary in\norder to convince us that the crystal-pictures are, in their own\nsense, a reality. Quite apart from the veridicalMty of some of\nthem ;\u2014the intrinsic evidence which they contain of knowledge\noutside the experimenter's ordinary knowledge ;\u2014they occur to a greater\nor less extent with so many persons of sanity and probity that we can\n\f43G Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nno more doubt their existence than we can doubt the existence of the\nallied phenomena of hypnagogic hallucinations or coloured audition,\nalready discussed.\nThe feature in the above experiments for which corroborative paral\nlels are most needed is, of course, the telepathic transference of the\npictures directly from one mind to another. On this point (with which\nMrs. Sidgwick and Miss Johnson are dealing in this part of the Pro-\nceedinyx) I may refer my reader to two papers by Dr. Gibotteau (a\nFrench physician, formerly interne at a Paris hospital, and now prac\ntising at Biarritz,) published in the Annates de% Sciences Psychiqnes for\nOctober and December, 1892. The whole paper should be studied, but\nI can here quote only a few experiments (made in 1888) which resemble,\nand in some ways surpass in interest, those which I have just detailed.\n1. I begin with the telepathic transference of a picture resembling the\ntransferred picture of the electric light at Eastbourne, mentioned above. But\nin Dr. Gibotteau's case the agent was some half-mile or so distant from the\npercipient, who was Dr. Gibotteau himself. This \" agent \" was a woman\nemployed in the creche of the hospital to which Dr. Gibotteau was attached,\nbut herself in good health and of tall and vigorous build ;\u2014 ,in type de\ncuisinitre. (She has since died of consumption.) She was remarkable as\nbeing at once herself extremely suggestible,\u2014so that, for instance, Drs. Gibot\nteau and Houeix produced on her a blister by suggestion in twenty-four\nhours,\u2014and also extremely capable of conveying suggestions toothers. Dr.\nGibotteau, although not himself easily thus influenced, received from her\nmany motor and emotional and a few visual suggestions. It is with one of\nthese last that we have now to deal.\n\" I am a sound sleeper, and I never remember having awoke spon\ntaneously in the middle of my sleep. But one night, about two or three\no'clock, I was suddenly aroused. Before I opened my eyes I thought, ' This\nis some trick of B.'s ! What is she meaning to make me see ?' I then\nlooked at the wall in front of me, and saw a round, luminous tract, and in\nthe middle a brilliant object, of the size of a melon, which I gazed at for\nsiveral seconds, being fully awake before it disappeared. I could not dis\ntinguish any clear shape, or any detail ; but the object was rounded, and\nthere seemed to be parts less luminous than the rest. I fancied that she had\nmeant to show me a skull, but I could not recognise one. That part of the\nwall was illuminated as it would have been by a powerful lamp. The room\nwas not absolutely dark, since there were no shutters and the window cur\ntains were not drawn. But no light seemed to be diffused by this bright\nobject outside that area on the wall of which it occupied the centre. That\nwas all. I waited for a moment and saw nothing else ; then I fell sound\nasleap again. Next day I mat Birthe at the hospital, and I questioned her\nwith due precaution. She had endeavoured to make me see dogs round my\nbed ; then men quarrelling, and finally a lantern. The two first attempts\nhad failed ; the third had succeeded perfectly.\"\n2. Equally interesting, in the case of an agent so often successful as Dr.\nGibotteau's paper shows Berthe to have been, are the cases of more or less\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 4G7\n- abortive hallucination apparently due to her effort from a distance. \"One\nsummer evening,\" says Dr. Gibotteau, \"at about 8 p.m., I was expecting\nBerthe at my lodgings. I stood on the balcony, looking into the street.\nFor some minutes past I had strongly felt her presence, and I supposed that\nshe was probably lingering somewhere near at hand. Then I saw, passing\nacross the wall behind me, .1 white reflection [im reflet blanc\u2014what another\ninformant has called \"a bright shadow \"]. The reflection from the sun on a\nwindow which is being moved would imitate what I saw ; but there was neither\nsun, nor moon, nor lighted lamps, for it was still daylight. I strongly felt\nBerthe's influence. Almost immediately I thought that I heard in the room\nbehind me one or two sharp little cries, like those of a mouse. Berthe\n-arrived almost at once ; and, questioned with due precaution, told me that\nshe had just attempted to show herself to me on the balcony, and then to\nmake me hear cries like those of her baby, a child a few months old.\"\n3. Dr. Gibotteau, I need not say, does not depend upon this coincidence\nas a proof of Berthe's powers ; but assuming those powers as sufficiently\nproved by the many more definite successes of which Dr. G. speaks, it is\ninteresting to trace the parallelism between the .stages of decreasing vivid\nness in experimental and in spontaneous hallucinations. The following\ninstance of actual failure of an intended hallucination\u2014reduced to mere\nemotional disturbance without visual image\u2014will remind the reader of\nvarious cases of vague fear and depression felt at the time of a friend's\ndeath, with no sensory phantasm. \"One night,\" says Dr. Gibotteau, \"I\nreturned home at midnight. On the landing, as I turned the handle of the\ndoor, I said to myself, ' What a bore ! Here is some other trick of Berthe's.\nShe is going to make me see something horrible in the passage ;\u2014it's very\ndisagreeable ! ' In a nervous state I opened the door with my eyes shut,\nand seized a match. In a few minutes I was in bed ; blew out the light,\nand put my head under the bedclothes, like a child. Next day Berthe\nasked me whether I had not seen in my passage or bedroom a skeleton which\nhad greatly frightened me. I need not say that a skeleton was the last\nthing in the world likely to terrify me ;\u2014and frankly I do not think that in\ncold blood I am a greater coward than my neighbours.\"\n4. There will be more to add as to the transference of emotional states\nwhen we deal with motor messages. Meantime the last case of Berthe's\n\"agency\" which I will now give is one where the intended transfer\nabsolutely failed ; but with a concomitant result curiously illustrating the\nviews as to the subliminal activity involved in such transference on which I\nhave already insisted.\n\"One day,\" says Dr. Gibotteau, \"when we wereawaiting Berthe's arrival,\nfor some experiments, she came in in a state of terror. ' Oh, I have had\nsuch a fright ! I will never do it again ! I am sure that you have seen\nnothing.' And she told us that at the foot of the staircase she had endea\nvoured to transmit to me a hallucination,\u2014to make me see a death's head.\n' I tried, I tried, but you would not see anything. Then it came back\nagainst me. I saw it in the staircase. Oh, what a fright it gave me ! ' The\nimpression made upon her had really been very strong. According to\nBerthe's explanation : ' When one works very hard to make someone see a\nfigure and he keeps it off, the figure comes back against oneself, just as if\n\f468 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nsomeone else had sent it to one.' I should interpret this incident as follows:\nA hallucination transmitted to me is the result of a series of successive efforts,\neach of which transmits itself in turn to the unconscious strata of my mind,\nuntil their sum has attained the intensity necessary to cause the image to\nemerge into the conscious stratum. At other times the threshold of con\nsciousness is not reached. The force is transmitted, but it remains unutilised\nin the unconscious strata. [In certain cases] the sensation accumulates in\nthe unconscious strata of the agent himself, which thus gradually become\novercharged, until the image emerges in the form of a spontaneous hallu\ncination. The mechanism of some other spontaneous hallucinations, those of\nthe insane especially, is probably much the same ; depending upon the sub\nconscious accumulation of a series of identical and successive images evoked\nby voluntary reverie.\"\n5. I will conclude these citations with a striking series of experiments in\nwhich Dr. Gibotteau was himself the agent, the percipient being a head\nnurse at his hospital ;\u2014a nervous subject over whom he gradually gained\ngreat power, without employing hypnotism. It will be seen that these\nexperiments form a close parallel to the Brighton series already given,\nexcept that Dr. Gibotteau's subject was far more rapidly receptive, and\ndeveloped the transmitted pictures without the use of a speculum of any\nkind.\n\"During the whole sitting Mme. It. remained seated on a sofa at about\na yard from where I sat on an armchair at right angles to her. A small\ntable stood before her. She at once half closed her eyes, and her look\nbecame somewhat vacant, but there was no change in her voice, no subse\nquent awakening, no interruption of memory, so that her state cannot be\nsaid to have been one of sleep. I did not take her hand (which I had some\ntimes previously done) at any point during these experiments. I began by\ngiving her hallucinations as to the objects on the table before her. I am\nnot myself a good visualiser ; but after looking at the real objects 1 shut my\neyes, called up a mental image of one of the objects, and modified it\naccording to my fancy. As the subject's eyes were closed, I think that for\nher, as for me, it was the mental image rather than the real image of the\nobject which underwent change. Hallucination is therefore perhaps too\nstrong a word to apply to the results produced. It was only at the end of\nthe throe hours' sitting that Mme. R. ceased to be able to distinguish\nbetween my suggested pictures and the realities round her. Up till then\nshe understood the true nature of the phantasmal pictures ; but nevertheless,\nwhen they were of a terrible kind, she became alarmed and begged ine to\nstop.\n\" A large inkstand with a spring was on the table. She saw it move first\nto the right, then to the left, to the edge of the table ; move about irregularly ;\nopen briskly as though by pressure on the spring ; upset and spill the ink ;\nthen lastly it opened and a small snake came out of it.\n\" I then determined, mentally, to suppress the inkstand, and to see only\nthe table-cover. The success was immediate ; the inkstand disappeared from\nMme. R.'s view, and continued absent as long as I chose.\n\"In front of the fireplace there lay a large piece of brown packing-paper,\nwhich kept the shape of the parcel which it had covered and left a hollow\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 4G9\nunder it. This paper took to undulating and rising, and from underneath\nit came a guinea-pig and several rabbits. I imagined one of these rabbits as\nwhite ; then the fancy took me to add a few patches of colour. ' Ha,' said\nshe, 'a white rabbit !\u2014no, it has a brown or yellow ear.' An enormous\nserpent succeeded to the rabbit. First it was coiled up under the paper, then\nit uncoiled itself and appeared in front of the table, to the terror of Mme.\nR. I cannot remember whether I succeeded in making the serpent hiss, as\nI tried to do.\n\" Then I attempted larger animals. Near the door of the room I made her\nsee a bay horse, then a white one, then a lion (which she guessed rather than\nsaw, for I imagined it very imperfectly), then a bear . . . which took my\nplace in the armchair. Sometimes I displaced myself in imagination, and I\nsaw the armchair with a great brown bear sitting in my place ; sometimes I\ntried to transform myself into the animal, seeing its paws in the place of my\narms, &c These two methods are quite distinct ; the second\u2014a direct trans\nformation\u2014seemed to me the easier of the two. I put successively in my\nplace a dog (very well seen), a horse (rearing where the armchair stood), and\na lion (which was still imperfectly evoked). Then I imagined the armchair\nempty ; and Mme. R. cried : ' Where are you 1 you are no longer in the\narmchair ; it frightens me.' I tried this illusion repeatedly, alternating it\nwith the animals ; and there was never any mistake. ' I do not see you\ndisappear suddenly : but in your place there is a kind of mist, which rapidly\nshrinks, and when it is gone the armchair is empty.' I profited by this\nhint ; and I found it more effective and less fatiguing to imagine in my place\na grey fog which dissolved from the circumference to the centre. I much\nregret that I did not try to show myself in another part of the room, leaving\nempty the armchair where I was really sitting. . . .\n\"At about midnight I put an end to the sitting, which had lasted nearly\nthree hours, and I accompanied my subject to her home. My influence over\nher had not diminished, and all along the street she saw, as I chose, lamps\nfalling on her from the Ltmp-posts, heaps of stones which obliged her to quit\nthe footpath, houses tottering, windows opening, and mattresses or men\nfalling out of them. All these images were very fugitive. I passed rapidly\nfrom one to another, but I always succeeded.\n' ' I have never again succeeded in obtaining results so remarkable either\nwith Mme. R. (over whom I soon lost power) or with any other subject. I\nmust have transferred some four hundred or five hundred images, of which\nvery few failed. ... I need hardly say that I gave no opportunity of\nguessing what I wished to be seen. Mme. R. had never, I believe, taken\npart in any similar experiments \u2022 and in point of fact the very notion of\nmost of these came to me as I perceived that my first attempts succeeded.\nI had no written notes or scheme of the sitting. It is unfortunate that I\nwas alone ; but I doubt whether I should have succeeded in the presence of\nothers. I am sure that the details have been faithfully preserved in my\nmemory. I will try and procure an independent account from Mme. R.\n[Mme. R. had since remarried, and Dr. G. has lost sight of her.]\n\"I ought to add that next day I found myself extremely fatigued ; almost\nas if I had passed several nights without sleep. No other sitting has ever\nexhausted me to a like degree.\"\n\f470 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nXII.\u2014The subject of these singularly successful experiments,\nalthough a sureeillante in the Parisian hospital where Dr. (xibotteau was\nthen interne, was herself decidedly hysterical. The young men, on the\nother hand, with whom the Brighton experiments were made, are\nstrong and healthy ;\u2014T., indeed, ranking as a formidable boxer. This\ncontrast suggests a point of controversy between M. Janet and myself\nwhich has both theoretical and practical importance, and which\nI am the more concerned to deal with as M. Janet has been the first\nforeign savant to take up the study of these automatisms, sensory and\nmotor, to which attention was called by the late Edmund Ourney and\nmyself, and has performed experiments of great interest first with\nautomatic script and now with crystal-gazing. Those experiments\nhave amply confirmed the real existence and real importance of these\nmodes of subliminal manifestation, at a time when few persons are in\na position either to confirm or to contest them from any personal experi\nence. M. Janet has experimented solely with patients known to\nbe hysterical, and generally under conditions which allowed him full\nand prolonged opportunities of observation and control. He hax\ntherefore made a very complete analysis of some very exceptional cases,\nwhile I have surveyed a wider field in less detail. His results are not\ninconsistent with my own, and have specially brought out the\nexistence of a subliminal memory more complete than the supralimin.il,\nwhich is one of the points most essential to my own general argument.\nBut M. Janet regards all such automatisms as indications of a\n\" disintegration of personality \" which is necessarily a morbid thing.\nAny split, in his view, must be a weakening ; any part of memory or\nperception or faculty which is separated oft' from the ordinary waking\nconsciousness must leave that consciousness by so much the poorer. In\nsupport of this view, if I mistake not, he would urge that in all the cases\nof automatism which he has himself investigated there has been a more\nor less conspicuous tendency to hysteria. The automatism, he would add,\nhas sometimes disappeared with the hysteria. And to meet the obvious\nrejoinder that his cases were all, or almost all, chosen by himself from\namong patients already known to be hysterical, he would say that the\nhysterical tendency is often latent and unnoticed, and that very likely\na more careful examination would have shown it to exist in the cases\nclaimed as healthy by Gurney and myself. And he would, I think,\nfurther consider that there was a clear a priori probability in his view,\ninasmuch as if you split up a machine meant to work as a whole, you\nmust inevitably weaken it. Automatism, he concludes, cannot exist in\nquite normal persons ; it must in itself be a sign of abnormality, that is\nto say, of actual or latent disease.\nI certainly feel that had I merely read M. Janet's arguments with\nout having any experience of my own by which to test them, I should\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 471\nregard them as extremely plausible. But I cannot ignore the fact that the\nautomatists of various kinds\u2014automatic writers, crystal seers and the\nlike\u2014whom I have myself actually known during the past twenty years\nwould now form a group of at least 200 persons, and that this group\n.would, to the ordinary eye, be indistinguishable from the ordinary world.\nI can hardly think that they have all\u2014men and women alike\u2014been\nhysterical without my finding it out. I might indeed say with truth\nthat these informants have (apparently at least) been on the whole\nabove the average physically as well as mentally. But I lay no stress\non this, and I think that such superiority is fully explained by the fact\nthat I have, of course, suggested experiments and sought for informa\ntion among my own friends, or other persons whom I believed to be sane\nand trustworthy, and thus have not taken mankind at random. Thus,\nif I wished, I might make a point, just opposite to M. Janet's, out of the\nfour cases which are here to be cited at length. One of these infor\nmants, I might say, is a man of quite exceptionally sound physique and\ngood sense-organs. He it is who feels the most marked results from\nthe steady gaze\u2014being speedily self-hypnotised. Two others are\nthoroughly healthy and vigorous, and they are excellent crystal seers.\nThe fourth has occasional accesses of ill-health, and although she is an\nexcellent crystal seer when well, if she is at all ill her power leaves her\naltogether.\nBut I do not myself hold that these automatisms are a sign of\nhealth any more than of disease, or of intelligence any more than of\n\" misere psychologique.\" So far as we really know as yet, the power\nseems a kind of physical accident, scattered at random, and indicating\nnothing beyond its own existence. Quite possibly hysterical patients\nmay very often be automatists. Hysterical patients are very often\nyoung women, but that does not prove that all young women are\nhysterical.\nBut, indeed, this question links itself with a larger one, which has\nbeen settled by experience far wider than either M. Janet's or mine. I\nmean the question whether hypnotism is morbid ; that is to say\nwhether the capacity of being hypnotised is, in itself, a sign of any\nkind of weakness, and especially of a hysterical tendency. My readers\nknow that this was the view of Charcot and the Salpetriere school ; and\nthat that view, even when most widely accepted, was regarded by\nEdmund Gurney and myself with absolute distrust. It has now\npractically collapsed ; the wide experience of the Nancy school having\nproved afresh and conspicuously what had been abundantly well\nknown since Elliotson's day to practical students of hypnotism outside\nhospitals, namely, that robust and healthy persons are often even more\nsusceptible to hypnotisation than feeble-minded persons or invalids.\nYet in hypnotism there may be almost every kind of di'mgreyation\u2014\n\f472 Mr. F. W. If. Myers.\nof splitting up\u2014of the Ego; and it is certainly hard to maintain that\nthe subject carrying out an elaborate post-hypnotic suggestion may be\nnormal, but that the experimenter who finds that he can hold a pencil\nand write automatically is ipso facto proving himself diseased.\nAs for the theoretical meaning to be assigned to such phenomena, I\nhave already, I hope, made it plain that in my view there is not a mere\ndisintegration of the ordinary or supraliminal personality, but rather a\nmanifestation (in many cases) of subliminal strata of personality which\nare rarely accessible except by automatisms of this kind. We are not\ndealing with the cracks in a plate, but with fissures which, like those of\nthe earth's crust, testify to unknown depths and a volcanic power beneath\nthem. In short, the splitting-up of our total individuality has, in my\nview, taken place already, and before our supraliminal memory begins ;\nand the result of these experiments is more often to reunite than\nfurther to sunder.\nTime and experience will show whether Professor Janet, who has\nthe difficult task of proving a negative, will be able to maintain his\nposition, or whether he will change his view, as M. Binet has already\ndone.i The practically important point, in my view, is that intending\nexperimenters should not be deterred by supposing that, if they suc\nceed, they will thereby in some way be proving their own unsoundness.\nIt is important thus to insist on the easiness and harmlessness of\nthe experiment, inasmuch as I have not as yet been able to persuade\nany large number of people to attempt crystal-gazing with even the\nmoderate degree of care and patience required. Possibly some fifty\npersons may have made the attempt, and from these I have about\nten accounts of some amount of success, which almost all come from\npersonal acquaintances of my own\u2014sometimes already known to me\nas automatists in other ways\u2014and thus give no real clue as to the\npercentage of crystal seers in the population at large. All my infor\nmants are leading ordinary healthy lives ; and, as will be seen, in the\ncase of one lady who has occasional attacks of illness, the power\naltogether leaves her at such times, returning when her strength is\nre-established. Most of the crystal seers known to me are women : but\nthis cannot be taken as indicating any real fact as to distribution of\nthe power of vision. It merely shows, I think, that in the educated\n* M. Binet, who formerly belonged to the strict Salpetriere school, now says in his\nbook Lei Alterations dc la Prrsonnalite, p. l97 : \" 11 est aujourd'hui devenu banal de\nremarquer que la plupart des experiences qu'on a pratiqnees sur des personnes\nhysteriques se r^petent avec des risultats a peu pies equivalents, mais amoindris, chez\nles personnes saines, et que par consequent l'hysturie . . . doit etre cont-idere\ncomme un reactif pennottant de lendre plus apparents certains phenombnos delicats\nde l'intelligence nonnale.\" It is gratifying to find that the view that these automatisms\nare \"delicate phenomenaof the normal intelligence\" has passed thus noiselessly from\na heresy into a commonplace.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 473\nclasses women have more time to spare than men. It is not until the\nexperiment is introduced into psycho-physiological laboratories (as J\nhave reason to hope may shortly be done in several universities) that\nwe shall have statistics enough to determine points of this kind. Four\nof my cases have exceptional interest, and shall be given at length ; to\nthe rest it will be enough to make briefer allusion.\nXIII.\u2014I will begin with a record contributed by Mrs. A. W.\n'Verrall, a lecturer at Newnham College, and known to the classical\nworld as the translator of Pausanias. Mrs. Verrall made the experi\nments simply at my request, without previous knowledge of the subject\nor interest in it. It will be seen that her crystal-visions do not involve\nany telepathy or clairvoyance. They present in somewhat developed\nform what appear to be usual early stages in this form of experiment.\nThe numbers within brackets represent the chronological order of the\nexperiments, all of which have been recorded without delay.\nM. 46. Case I.\u2014Mrs. Verrall.\nIt is a little more than three years ago that I first began experiments in\n\" crystal-gazing.\" I am, I believe, a good visualiser, and am in the habit of\nembodying the greater part of my ideas in some pictorial form. The mention\nof any name calls up a mental picture instantly, and I am often aware of the\npicture of an idea before I have grasped the means of expressing it in words.\nI have tried to find faces in the fire, and shapes in the clouds, with the usual\nsuccess, and I have had some spontaneous impressions of persons or scenes ;\nbut the visions obtained by looking intentionally into a glass of water or a\ncrystal are in some respects unlike all other visual impressions which I have\nreciived. I should perhaps say that the sight of my two eyes is very unlike,\nso unlike that I believe that I never use both at once. The left eye is very-\nfar-sighted and the right quite short-sighted. I habitually use the short\nsighted eye for reading, writing, &c., but am often conscious of a difficulty\nof vision if I shift the position of my book so as to bring it a little beyond\nthe range of the short-sighted eye. In that case the words seem to alter in\nsize and move to and fro as they do when one is adjusting a telescope to suit\nthe sight. I have never been able to use an opera-glass.\nI have tried various objects in crystal-gazing, such as a cut crystal, a\nglobular crystal, a glass paper-weight and a glass full of water, and I find no\ndifference in their efficacy. I have also tried under varying conditions of\nlight, with the conclusion that a dim light is the most likely to result in the\nseeing of a picture. I have sometimes seen pictures in quite bright light, but\nnever in absolute darkness. Often I see nothing at all but the bright points\nof light in the crystal, and often I see nothing in the crystal, but get a mental\npicture suggesting something I have forgotten to do. Indeed, I find crystal-\ngazing a very convenient way of recalling things forgotten, but in that case I\nsee nothing in the crystal. The difference between a picture in the crystal\nand a mental picture is quite marked but difficult to describe ; it will\nperhaps help to show what I mean if I say that the recalled image of what I\nhave seen in the crystal differs as much from the actual image as the mental\n\f474 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nimage of a person (lifters from the actual person. I believe that with me\nthe crystal picture is built up from the bright points in the crystal, aa\nthey sometimes enter into it ; but the picture, when once produced, has a\nreality which I have never been able to obtain when looking into the fire or\ntrying to call up an imaginary scene with my eyes shut. It has occasionally\nhappened that I have been able to see more on a closer investigation than on\nthe first glance, but if I try to interpose a magnifying-glass between my eye and\nthe crystal the picture instantly goes and only the recollection remains. The\nfollowing case is almost the only one where I have seen a real person, and\nhere the picture grew distinct as I looked.\nI saw (27) a black object which defined itself into the head of a man ; then I\nsaw that it was my husband's head turned nearly in profile towards my left.\nBehind it was a square-Kicked chair of brown leather. He was reading, his.\neyes being on a book, which I could not see. I tried to see the whole figure,\nin order to know what the book was. and shut my eyes. On opening them I\nsaw the whole figure for a moment, but it was too small for me to distinguish\nanything. In a moment the head came back, and I had an impression that\nthe book was red, though I could not see it.\nAs far as I could ascertain, this picture was not telepathic. This is not\nthe only occasion on which I have had a distinct impression of colour coupled\nwith a consciousness that I had not seen the colour. Once I saw a flower (20)\nwhich \"I knew to be pink, though I saw no colour,\" and again (12) I once\nsaw a \" black cat with ribbon round neck which I knew to be red though it\nhad no colour.\" In these last two cases I spent some time trying to see the\ncolour which I knew to be there, but I was not successful. In the greater\nnumber of cases the picture has been coloured, but sometimes I am (3, 32)\nonly aware of luminosity and darkness, sometimes (23) of black and white ns.\nin a pen-and-ink sketch. I have not been able to find that the colour of the\nbackground for the crystal produces any effect on the colour of the picture.\nI have tried placing the crystal on white linen, dark blue silk, bright blue\nstuff and red leather, but have never been conscious of any suggestion of\ncolour from the background, or able to trace any connection between the\nbackground and the vision.\nMovement occurs not infrequently in the pictures and so does change.\nI use the word movement when I see in the crystal a picture within which\noccurs an alteration, and the word change when the whole picture undergoes\nalteration and is succeeded by another. Thus there was movement in the\nfollowing case : (8) \"Landscape, large piece of still water in evening light,\nbeyond it mountains and hills, two snowy peaks, one sharply defined dark\nhill in front\u2014open space on right of mountains. Steamer passing from\nright to left till it touched shore and was lost to sight.\"\nThe next case (20) illustrates what I mean by change. \"I saw nothing\nfor some time. Then a flower like a convolvulus, which I knew to be pink\nthough I saw no colour, first sideways, then facing with a hard round knob\nin the middle. Then I knew it was not pink, but metal. I knew this from\nthe hardness of outline, not the colour. It kept changing from one position\nto the other.\"\nI will now give a case (32)\u2014the only one\u2014in which occurred change as\nwell as movement :\u2014\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 475\n\" Saw sphere in circle, only upper half visible\u2014suggested globe on stand.\nThen the thing turned aslant and the outer ring was fiery, the sphere black,\nouter ring revolving, sphere apparently still ; presently I saw that the sphere\nwas also revolving. \"\nI have sometimes been aware of development in the picture\u2014things at\nfirst dim and confused becoming clear and distinct, but I distinguish between\nthis gradual development and the movement and change described above.\nThe variety of pictures seen is considerable ; I have classified as follows\nthe 33 crystal-visions recorded, covering a period of 21 months.\na. Animals, 5.\nb. Human figures, 7.\nc. Common objects, 5 (such as clock, ring, melon, &c.).\nd. Geometrical figure, 1.\ne. Written words, 2.\n\/. Scenes, 4.\ng. Fanciful groups or scenes, 9.\nWith regard to the written words (e),I may say that both instances occurred\nafter a distinct suggestion from myself. On the first occasion I looked in the.\ncrystal immediately after writing to ask for an address which I had known but\nforgotten. I saw a row of small letters, wondered if they represented the\naddress required, then saw plainly 39, Onslow-square. It was only the number\nwhich I wanted, and I found that the number was not correct. On the second\noccasion (10) I had been trying to obtain automatic writing while looking in the\ncrystal. I was also wondering who had put a pair of lost scissors in a very\nconspicuous place, where I had just found them. I saw a name written,\nand found that hiy right hand had written the same name ; it was a\nname likely to occur to me. Under the seventh head (g), \"Fanciful groups or\nscenes,\" come the largest number of cases. The first picture I ever saw (1)\nwas one of this class. A friend of mine had been telling me of Miss X.'s\nexperiences, of which I then heard for the first time, and the idea occurred\nto me of trying whether I had any similar faculty. I looked into a glass of\nwater on a white pocket-handkerchief, in broad daylight, for a quarter of an\nhour. I saw a group, consisting of a beautiful draped figure (on my right)\nwith curly hair, and something uplifted in its left hand. The right hand was\nheld downwards, but not quite close to the side. The figure sometimes\nlooked to my left, sometimes faced me, shifting from one position to the\nother. The right hand was not defined. On my left, on a flat stone, was a\nhuge toad, its back towards me, gazing at the figure.\nOn another occasion (4), I saw a large snail-shell, with a baby's face\nlooking out of the end where the snail should be ; it was not very distinct,\nbut the markings of the shell were visible, and it was coloured.\nOne other (10) of these fancy pictures I will give in detail, as it was rather\nmore elaborate than most. I was looking at the crystal on a blue ground,\nwith a single lamp at some distance in the room.\nMy eyes soon got tired, then the colour on the crystal grew pale primrose,\nthen the colour of pale burnished brass. Then I saw a small bright fairy\nfigure fly across from left to right, followed by a large black swallow-like\ncreature. When the swallow reached the right edge of the picture it turned\n\f476 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nback (without turning round), moving towards the left, and presently the\nfairy came into sight, but turned round with its head towards the swallow\nand arms uplifted, as if beating it off. The swallow seemed smaller than\nbefore. But with a swoop, the swallow, huge as before, swept again to the\nright, pushing the fairy before it. I saw a faint light, like an evening sky,\nbehind the tail of the swallow, and then all was black darkness.\nI find it very difficult to say what size the pictures appear to me to be,\nas I have nothing to compare them with. They seem to me, however, not to\nbe bounded by the size of the crystal, and they vary in the impression\nproduced. But though tho things certainly appear to me sometimes to be\n\" large,\" and sometimes \" small,\" I am quite unable to determine how such\nan impression is produced.\nI have taken considerable pains to endeavour to trace connections Detween\nthe pictures in the crystal and ideas or objects lately present to my mind,\nbut there are only nine cases out of the thirty-three where I have perceived\nany possible connection between my thoughts and my visions. I will give\nthese nine cases in detail. In seven cases the vision was possibly due to\nsomething in the thoughts or experience immediately preceding the crystal-\ngazing ; in the eighth case there is perhaps a likeness between the vision and\nan object constantly seen during some days before and after the crystal-\nvision ; the ninth case is difficult to classify.\nTwo of these seven (4, 10) have already been mentioned ; they are the\ncases where written words appeared. In the next case (5) I had been\nwondering what people we should meet at a luncheon party to which we were\ngoing, audi saw in the crystal a human figure, that of \"an old lady in black,\nwith a veil or hood on,\" not a very likely guest, perhaps. In the fourth case\n(24) after \"endless fleeting pictures, single figures, groups, sense of rush,\nfigure with arm out,\" suddenly the whole became clear \"and I saw a man in\nuniform and cap, with gold or silver braid, holding out his arm to signal, and\na train rushing on full speed, and I knew there was an accident, though I\nsaw none. \" I had been to town and back on that day. The next two (29, 30)\nwere seen in immediate succession ; I saw first the letter A in small bright\nstars, with a comet overhead, and on looking again, a pyramid dark against\na red sky. I find a note in the book that we had been \"noticing the red\nglow of the sky, and a star,\" just before I looked in the crystal. The last\nof these cases (32) is one already described ; I need only add the suggested\nexplanation, that I had been in the late afternoon at a lecture illustrated by\nlantern, and that this vision occurred about an hour after my return from the\nlecture.\nIn the next case I have to mention (15), the connection is not obvious, and\npossibly there is none at all, but I give the note and the comment as they\nstand in my book. I \" saw a floating figure holding something outstretched\nin the right hand, which became defined as a wand. The figure faced me,\nhad trailing robes. It was approaching a bright object, which defined itself\ngradually as a crescent moon with a face. The figure was dark ; the outline\nof the figure was indistinct, and the general effect that of a dark, irregular\ncross ; the crescent was very brilliant.\" Two days after this vision, as I took\nup a book which I had been reading aloud every evening for some days, I\nnoticed on the cover a picture of a moon with a figure\u2014not, however, a face\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 477\n\u2014which reminded me of my crystal picture. On looking again I could sec-\nno close resemblance, but the book may have suggested the \" vision,\" just\nas it certainly recalled it.\nIn the next case also (25) the actual sight of an object recalled a crystal\npicture which it may have originally suggested. On August 25th, 1890,\nI was at Brighton, where I had been for some time. I saw in the crystal, at\n10.15 p.m., an \"ugly clock in white alabaster, round face on hideous stand,\ndial black, letters gold.\" I made a rough sketch of the outline of this clock,\nbut it suggested nothing to me at the time. On September 9th, im\nmediately after returning to Cambridge, I went to the house of a woman I\nknew to inquire after a servant of mine who had been suddenly attacked\nwith mania and removed to this house\u2014her sister's\u2014and thence to the\nasylum. On entering the room I noticed the clock, having some unexplained\nassociation with it. Then it flashed upon me that it was the clock I had\nseen in the crystal. It was, however, not perfectly like. The real clock is\nin shape like the visionary clock, and is of the same material. The dial,\nhowever, is white, not black, with gold letters ; but there are in the real\nclock two round black ornamental spots on the stand, which did not appear\nin the vision. I had heard on August 22nd that my servant had been taken to\nthis house, and had been thinking a great deal about both the servant and\nher sister. I had once been in the house, about a year before, and probably\nseen the clock, though I had no conscious recollection of it. I found,\nhowever, that they had had the clock when they went into the house, and\nthat it had always stood on the mantelpiece, so that I must have seen it on\nmy first visit. I have never since seen any clock at all like the \"crystal\nclock,\" though I have taken special notice of my friends' clocks.\nTwo other incidents I have recorded in connection with crystal-gazing,\nbut they are not included in the thirty-three cases mentioned above. On one\noccasion (14), while looking into the crystal, I had a sudden vision, not con\nnected with any points of light in the crystal, and not in any way resembling\na crystal-vision. I noted the exact minute of the appearance, which I have\nnever done except in the case of what I may call external visions, such as I\nhave sometimes seen when I have not been seeking to obtain them. I have\nhad at least three such visions, once on looking up suddenly towards a\nwindow and twice on turning to a looking-glass. But they are quite unlike\nthe crystal-visions, and I only mention this here to make the record complete.\nOn another occasion (18), I was reading and looked up towards the fire,\nwhen I saw in my crystal, which was on the mantelpiece as usual, a small\nfigure spring up and run across the crystal. The figure was dressed in close-\nfitting green clothes and might have been a monkey or a man. It disappeared\nwith a skip out of the right-hand side of the crystal. This vision differs from\nthe usual ones, in that the figure was distinctly inside the crystal and\ndisappeared when it reached the limit of the crystal. It was also spontaneous,\nas 1 had no intention of looking at the crystal.\nI have not attempted to draw any inferences from the crystal visions I\nhave had, but have only recorded them, classifying them roughly in order\nthat they may be a little less unintelligible than the bare record of them\nwould otherwise be. I hope to obtain some further results when I have\ntime to look regularly in the crystal, but I find it of no use to look for\n2 K\n\f478 Mr. F. W. H Myers.\nvisions unless I am fairly free from absorbing interests or occupations of any\nkind. I shall be very glad to receive any suggestions for experiments to be\ntried in future.\nI may add that my health is usually good, and was good during the time\nof my experiments in crystal-gazing. 1 felt no fatigue, nor any evil or\nunpleasant result from the experiments.\nM. de G. Verrall.\nThese experiments suggest several reflections\n1. This is almost the only case where I have as yet found that the\ninfluence of points de repere was manifest to the experimenter herself.\nSuch points or specks of reflection may sometimes have been influential\noven when not consciously observed. But in most cases the conditions\nof vision seem to make this unlikely ;\u2014the vision generally beginning\nwith a bright light followed by a smoky cloud in the crystal. In fact\nthe genesis of crystal pictures is apt to resemble the genesis of spon\ntaneous, rather than that of hypnotically-suggested, hallucinations.\nA Cambridge undergraduate known to me\u2014another crystal seer, by\nthe way, whom it would be difficult to suspect of hysteria\u2014thinks that\nthe first picture seen by him in the crystal, a mere delta of light, took its\norigin from a bright point of reflection. But with him the pictures\nalmost at once followed quite another analogy ; they became like very\nbrilliant illusions hypnagogiqit.es, and soon seemed to come close to\nthe eye, wherever the crystal might be placed. I defer further\naccount of this case (Mr. S. W. S.) until more experiments have been\nmade.\n2. Mrs. Verrall's subjective conviction that such and such an\nobject was pink when no pink was visible, suggests two interesting\nparallels. In the first place it somewhat resembles the conviction of\na blind correspondent of Professor W. James (Principles of Psychology,\nVol. II., p. 323) that the coat, say, of a figure in his mental picture, or\nquasi-hallucination, was \" pepper-and-salt,\" although he had no true\nvisual memory of colours. And in the second place it reminds us of\nsome of the subjects of audition colorfe (see especially Professor\nGruber's paper already referred to) who know that a certain sound is\naccompanied by a certain colour, but do not actually see the colour.\nWhen the idea of a colour is thus cerebrally initiated we may expect\nthat it will present various degrees of intensity. Below the point at\nwhich such an idea becomes (so to say) definite entencephalic i vision\nthere may be a feeling of obscure subliminal connection between the\none form of sensation and the other. The colours seen by \" sound-\ni I cannot avoid using this word, already suggested {Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p 341,\nNote), as correlative to cntnptic. The \" chromatisms \" which the sound seer sees\n\"in his brain\" are comparable to the phosphenes which we all may see \" in\ncur eyes.\" They are a quite different thing from imagination-images, or \" mind's-eye \"\nvision.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 479\nseers \" (a shorter term than \"subjects of audition coloree\") are often\nof a special indescribable shade.1 The light in \" photopsy from shock \"\u2014\nwhich shock, as Fere points out, need not necessarily affect the head\ndirectly\u2014is also of a tint and quality hard to parallel in external\nvision. Professor James's absolutely blind correspondent, already\nmentioned, insists that he has sensations\u2014for himself quite definite and\nmi generis\u2014corresponding to the names of colours. If any fresh case\nwere to occur of the restoration to sight of persons blind from infancy,\nit would ba very desirable to get them to compare previous notions of\ncolour with the reality. Our increasing knowledge of this enten-\ncephalic chromatopsy adds a fresh interest to the question,\u2014important\nalike for the physiologist and the psychologist,\u2014as to what is really\ninvolved in the \" externalisation \" of an inward picture. Are actual\nchanges set up in the retina t such chemical or other changes as\nhabitually induce retinal fatigue, and tend to induce complementary\ncolours ? In earlier writings on hallucinations Gurney and I assumed\nas probable that in the case of a completely externalised hallucination\nthere was some retinal change. Fere takes this view as regards\nhypnotic hallucinations, and asserts that he himself can call up a\nmental image of a red spot so strongly that he gets a green after\nimage of the imaginary red spot. Wundt also takes such after\nimages as a proved fact, both in the case of illusions hypnago-\ngiques and of hallucinations in general. \" The phantasms of sight,\"\nhe says, \" which present themselves before falling asleep, are some\ntimes so vivid that (as J. Midler, H. Meyer, and others have\nobserved) they may be followed by after-images. In such cases the\nexcitation from the central sensory tracts seems to have extended itself\nto the retina.f' 2 And again : \" Hallucinations do not only resemble\nordinary sense-perceptions in all their directly-given subjective peculiari\nties but they may also be followed by positive and negative after-images,\nsuch as follow on the fatigue of the sensory apparatus.\" 3 A hint,\nhowever, kindly given by Dr. A. W. Waller, to the effect that\nwe need that such cases should be \"observed with full appreciation\nof the astonishing minuteness of excitation capable of acting as\nsuggestion to certain subjects,\" has suggested to me to press my crystal\nseers to careful observation of their own experience in the matter.\nThe result, briefly, is that of the four crystal seers whose cases I give\n.'tt length two good visualisers believe that they do see complementary\ncolours following on phantasmal images, while the third good visualiser,\nMrs. Verrall, with Miss A., who is a bad visualiser, can see no suck\ni Firi, Pathologic des Emotions, p. 30.\ns Wundt, Phys.

Miss X's experience on this point will be found in the-\ncourse of her own narrative. Mr. Keulemnns writes :\u2014\nAfter calling up, mentally, a bright red, I can see (though not always) the\ncomplementary colour, when looking up to the ceiling immediately afterwards.\nVet I have never succeeded in thus obtaining the complementaries of iiale\nshades, such as lemon yellow and lilac, greys or browns.\nMrs. Verrall sends the following remarks, which are of interest on\nthe whole question of the externalisation of images, and also as to the\ntransformation into visual terms of a tactile impression subliminally\nreceived.\nSince recording my experiments in crystal-vision I have been trying\nsome further experiments of a different kind, with a view to testing my\npower of visualisation.\nI find that I am able to call up a voluntary picture of an object or a scene\nwith extreme distinctness ; indeed, in the case of a simple object, the visual\nimage, as far as I can discover, differs from the actual object only in having\nno solidity\u2014that is, it casts no shadow and appears to be all on the same\nplane. The form is as well defined and the colour appears as vivid in the\nvisualisation as in the real thing. I have endeavoured to ascertain whether\nform and colour are equally well reproduced in the visualisation, and as far\nas my own impression goes there is no difference ; I never think of a coloured\nobject without its colour, but I have not been able to produce complementary\nafter-images from gazing at an imaginary colour. I may say that it is only\nafter a prolonged gazing at a real colour that I can see the complementary\nafter-imago, and the colour of the after-image is never anything but very\nfaint.\nMy visualisations usually, as I have said, have no solidity, but I am able\nat any time to invest them with solidity by imagining that I see the real\nthing and not a memory or imagination picture. In that case they cast\nshadows, and I am able to realise distance. I have much more control over\nthem when once they are there than I have over crystal-visions.\nAt one time, some three years ago, I tried a longish series of experiments\nwith cards with a view to seeing whether I could educate my sense of touch\nsufficiently to distinguish the cards after passing my thumbs once swiftly\nover the face of each card. I had some success, but the reason I record the\nexperiment here is this : At first, while my attention was consciously\ndirected to my fingers, I was aware that I could detect differences in smooth\nness of surface, which I learnt gradually to interpret ; but after a couple of\nhundred trials, when I grew more expert and more familiar with the experi\nment, I lost all consciousness of the means which enabled me to guess, ami\n\"saw\" pictures of the cards which \"determined\" the particular guess.\nThis experiment seems to show that conclusions arrived at by other means\nare presented to my mind in the form of visual images, and suggests that\nsudden visual impressions, spontaneous as well as induced, may in my case\nbe projected visually after they have been produced in some other way.\n3. Mrs. Verrall has on two occasions had spontaneous visions of\nscenes, not resembling the crystal-visions, but appearing to alter her\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 481\nwhole surroundings. These visions she believes to have been veridical ;\nto have conveyed a more or less accurate knowledge of what was pass\ning or had passed elsewhere. If this be so, then in her case the\n\u2022experimental visions appear less profound than the spontaneous ; which\nis in accordance with analogy. Once, after an apparently complete\nrecovery from illness, she had a purely pathological hallucination,\nwhich she at once recognised as such and which was several times\nrepeated.\nThe veridical visions represented scenes of no special or exciting\ncharacter ; but rather, as often in these cases, seem to have been flashed\nupon the percipient \"by mere chance.\" I subjoin her account.\nM. 48.\nAs supplementary to the pictures I have seen in the crystal, I add brief\naccounts of other visions I have had spontaneously, which may have been\nproduced by causes somewhat similar, as I was in each case looking towards\n;\\ looking-glass. The first was in 1885, some years before I had heard of\ncrystal-gazing, and a few months after I had received an impression about\nmy husband which seemed to be telepathic.\n1885, May 5th, Tuesday, 8.45 a.m. This morning, about 8.10, as I was\nstanding before my glass, after A. had gone down to breakfast, I had a sudden\nsensation of absolute stillness\u2014cessation of sound\u2014and looking up saw A.\nacross the breakfast-table with papers in his hand, which he was reading.\nAs he was not standing in his usual place, but on my side of the table, I\ninferred that it was my letters he was reading, and ran downstairs to see.\nHe was standing as I had seen him (i.e., opposite my place, not his own)\nwith Triibner's catalogue in his hands ; I told him of my vision as soon as I\ncame down.\nThe second case occurred on July 29th, 1890. I was in my room in the\nafternoon, thinking about a paper I had just read in the Proceedings and of a\nfriend with whom I had talked of the matter in question, when \"as J turned\nto the glass I had a sudden impression of Mr. Y., in Swiss mountaineering\ncostume, light dittos and hat, sitting astride on an arete, face downwards,\nwith a stick or ice-axe across the figure. Some other man was standing\nbelow, looking up.\" The picture did not impress me as veridical, though it\nwas very vivid. But the feeling in my mind was one of amusement, not\nalarm, nor interest\u2014the attitude being obviously absurd, and impossible in\nan ascent of any real difficulty or danger. It suggested rather a person\nsliding down a stair rail, but I saw the snow and rocks of an arete quite\nplainly. I believed Mr. Y. to be in Dauphins' at the time.\nI wrote to him later in the autumn asking him what he was doing on July\n2!Hh, at 4.15 p.m., and heard that it was an off day, and that he was prob\nably loitering about in front of the hotel. When I saw him in November\nI told him what I had seen, and he then said that he had actually been\nastride of an arete for a moment on the day before, July 28th, but had not\nremained so long, thinking the attitude unnecessary. The guide had crossed\nfirst, sitting astride, and Mr. Y. was second, the whole number of the party\nbeing four. The arete did not, however, slope downwards, but was nearly\nlevel.\n\f482 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nI append a copy of the note of tho possibly telepathic impression of my\nhusband above referred to :\u2014\n\" 1884, October 20th, Monday, 2.45 p.m. I waited lunch to-day for A.\n[who was in College, as usual on Monday] till two o'clock, without thinking\nwhy he should be late, as he often is not home much before two. But at\ntwo o'clock [by the dining-room clock] I began lunch. Then, as I was think\ning that A. had said he should be home at the ' usual time ' [1.45] there\nsuddenly flashed across me \"\u2014I was facing tho window\u2014\"a picture of A.\nstanding with pipers in his hand and Mr. Z. sitting in a chair not quite\nclose or straight to a square-cornered table. And there followed the thought\n'Oh, yes; A. has left those proofs . . . with Mr. Z.' The next\nmoment it struck me as odd that I should have had the impression first and\nthe explanation after, so I looked at the clock. It was 2.5. I felt certain\nthat A. would not be home for eight or nine minutes, which is the time it\ntakes him to walk from College, and, indeed, when he rang the bell it was\n2.14. As soon as he came into the room I said, ' Have you been to Mr. Z.\nto look at the proofs?' When he said 'Yes,' I asked again, 'Have you\ncome straight from there ? ' And on his saying ' Yes ' again, I told him of\nmy impression.\"\nMy husband confirms this account, and adds that during the latter part\nof the interview with Mr. Z. he had been standing and Mr. Z. sitting at a\ntable. The coincidence of time must have been pretty nearly exact. I\nought to say that I knew that Mr. Z. had received the proofs to look over\nthe night before, but neither A. nor I had the least expectation of their\nbeing so soon done, and A. would not have called on Mr. Z. that morning if\nhe had not gone to A.'s rooms in the course of the morning to ask him to\ndo so.\nM. he G. Vekball.\nXIV.\u2014It may be further observed that the tendency of automa\ntism to hypcrnmesia is shown in its nascent form in Mrs. Yerrall's\nhabit of remembering forgotten names, &c, by gazing into the crystal.\nAnd as it is on this point that Professor Janet's experiments have\nlargely turned, I may here quote a report, revised by himself, of the\nremarks with which he followed this paper when it was read (in\npart) to the International Congress of Experimental Psychology,\nAugust 3rd, 1892 :\u2014\nM. 49.\nProfessor Janet, having been invited to speak upon the paper, said that\nhe would content himself with certifying the reality of the facts described by\nMr. Myers. In certain circumstances there were patients who could not\nlook long on a shining surface without experiencing illusions and a kind of\nhallucinations. Sometimes those hallucinations possessed interest ; some\ntimes they might furnish important information on the state of mind of the\npatient. He cited some of the hallucinations which he had studied. (1) It\nwas known that after serious attacks of natural somnambulism there was a\ncomplete loss of memory of what had passed during the attack. Sometimes\nrecollection could be restored easily, by divers processes, and in particular\nby suggestion. Too often it was impossible to restore recollection in this.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 483\nway ; and it was then necessary to use artificial means. That of which he\nhad availed himself most often was the well-known process of automatic\nwriting ; but other methods might be adopted. One day a young female\npatient had an attack of somnambulism, during which she had written a\nletter which she had afterwards torn up, and the contents of which she had\nforgotten. By causing her to gaze upon a shining surface he succeeded in\nmaking her read by hallucination the whole of that letter. (2) Many patients\nwere tormented by fixed ideas. Some had full consciousness of those ideas\nand openly stated what they were. Others could not well describe them,\nand did not clearly know what it was which tormented them. Others had no\nnotion of those fixed ideas, which provoked only states of emotion and\nimpulsions in them. For example : a young man had continual fear, without\nbeing able to explain what he was afraid of. It was sufficient to make him\ngaze on a shining surface for some time for him to see the flames of a fire ;\nand after listening to a monotonous sound for some time he became aware of\ncertain other sounds, those of the bugle of the fire brigade ; in a word, that\nprocess revealed the persistent idea of a fire which he had witnessed at some\nprevious date. (3) Certain patients attacked by abonlie (loss of volitional\npower) needed to see from time to time a person who acted as the director\nof their conscience. When the patient had quitted this director he or she\nwas well ; but at the end of a variable time again fell ill and needed, so to\nspeak, to be wound up again. It was difficult to know what characterised\nthe period of health. A patient of that kind had, at the time when she\ngazed steadily at an object, the hallucination of seeing M. Janet's portrait,\nwhich acted as a kind of moral direction which persisted unconsciously. As\nfor the explanation of the facts, he agreed that Mr. Myers was right in\nsuggesting very different causes according to the cases. It was impossible\nto explain all those complex phenomena by a single word. There was\nsuggestion, certainly ; but there were also other very different things, such\nas the associations of ideas, the modifications of the state of consciousness,\ndreams, &c. As to the patients whom he had observed, he had always been\nstruck by the phenomena concerning the power of attention. They were\nalways weak patients, who were incapable of fixing their attention long on\nthe same object ; when they were forced to do so for a long time they\nexperienced every kind of psychological modification. In particular they\nlost the control of their movements and of their ideas. He had seen, for\nexample, a child of that character who could not pay attention at school\nwithout having a kind of convulsion. With his patients the dreams which\nthey had been made to undergo automatically manifested themselves easily\nwhen the conscious thought was almost suppressed by fatigue. In a word, it\nwas an ingenious process for bringing to light dreams which had been dreamt\nwithout the knowledge of the dreamer.\nWith crystal-seers at an early stage confused reminiscences often\nsupply the staple of the pictures. Thus Miss Z, a cousin of the\nMarquis of Bute, to whom pictures come slowly and obscurely, saw\nseveral scenes which to her seemed new, but which Lord Bute, with\nmuch probability, traced to memories of scenes well known to him,\nand which this lady knew less intimately. Somewhat similarly, I\n\f4S4 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nhave watched an experiment in which Miss Z described the slow\nformation of a crystal-picture of a man's head, which only after a long\ntime she saw to be almost certainly intended as a picture of Tito\u2014the\nhero-villain of Romola, which she had just been reading. This slow\nand difficult vision was found somewhat fatiguing; nor should I recom\nmend any experimenter to push the trial to a point at which any\nstrain on mind or eyes is felt. I leave for comment on a futuie\noccasion several similar cases, which, though still at this early stage,\nseem likely to develop into more of interest.\nXV.-\u2014With the experiments of my next informant, Miss X, readers\nof these Proceedings are already familiar. It is gratifying to know that\nit was her paper on Crystal-gazing in Part XIV. (to which all who have\nnot read it should here refer) which led Professor Janet to undertake\nthe interesting experiments above narrated. It will be seen that Miss\nX's phenomena continue pretty steadily, and that her earlier conclu\nsions from them, although in several ways developed, have not needed\nany important modification. Her results increase, of course, in value\nwith each year's continuance. As to the relation of the visions to\nhealth, for instance, Miss X's experience should now carry much\nweight. I will leave her to speak for herself, beginning with this topic\nof health, and gradually ascending the scale of intrinsic interest in the\nvisions recoided.\nCase II.\u2014Miss X.\nM. 60.\nHealth.\u2014In view of certain statements which arc current as to the\nphysical conditions of crystal-gazing, I wish to say, as emphatically as\npossible, that in my own case these experiments are neither the cause nor\nthe effect of any morbid condition.\nI can say positively, from frequent experience, that to attempt experi\nments when mind and body are not entirely at ease is absolute waste of time.\nThe very conditions which might make crystal-gazing a fatiguing and\nexhausting process render it impossible. I can with equal certainty disclaim,\nfor myself, the allegation that success in inducing hallucinations of this kind\nis due in any way to an itat maladif. The four years during which I have\ncarried on experiments in crystal-gazing have hecn among the healthiest of\nmy life. I cannot describe myself as robust ; and indeed I was for more\nthan three years an invalid\u2014the direct cause of my illness being a railway\naccident ;\u2014but my incapacity is for the endurance of vitiated atmosphere\nand late hours, and not for habits of early rising, systematic mental work,\nand a walk of from six to twelve miles a day in almost all weathers. I belong\nto no effete race, but to a family which for physique and longevity might\nchallenge any in the annals of Mr. Francis Galton ;\u2014a family which has\nnever lived in cities, and which, for many generations, has expended its\nenergies and ambitions on horses and hounds.\nClassification of Pictures.\u2014I may divide my crystal-visions into three\nclasses, which pass into each other by gradual transition. First and lowest\n1 place the most numerous class, consisting partly of mere reproductions,\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 485\nwhich may be voluntary or may be spontaneous, of objects recently seen\u2014\narranged, perhaps, in some fantastic way ; but more largely of pictures\nwhich are merely fanciful, and have, so far as I know, no actual counterpart\nin fact. These, of course, I discourage as mere waste of time. Such\npictures plainly bring no fresh knowledge ; they seem merely to objectify\nordinary mind's-eye pictures, or the meaningless scraps of inward visions\nwhich float before one when attention is relaxed. These are quite as vivid as\nany other crystal-pictures, and will come at any time, if I am not over-tired.\nAbove these comes a class of pictures which, though they may not communi\ncate any new fact, yet impress me as containing some memory or some imagin\native effect which does not come from my ordinary self. In this class I should\nplace revivals of memory, and also illustrations of thought :\u2014e.g., pictures\nappropriate to a story of which I have thought, or to the sentiment of a piece\nof music, or to a place of which I have heard some mention. I feel that my\nordinary self has not invented these pictures ; and that they show a coherent\nintelligence ; but that intelligence is working on date which I have at some\ntime or other consciously acquired. The third class, which is the rarest,\nconsists of pictures which are in some sense veridical ; which bring me\ninformation as to something, past, present, or future, which I have no other\nmeans of knowing.\nClass I.\u2014I can generally, but not always, see in a crystal, or other clear\ndepth or smooth surface, a life-like picture of some object which has lately\noccupied my attention\u2014as a book which I have been reading, an advertise\nment in a railway carriage, &c. These pictures do not resemble the after\nimages which seem to blur my retina after I have looked at a bright scene.\nThose after-images are, with me, indistinct, and show no true colours, only a\ncontrast of bright and dark. The crystal-pictures, on the other hand, show\ntrue colours, and are like memory-images, only more distinct. If, however,\nI only sec images of this kind, I generally cease to look. Their only interest\nlies in the facility which they offer for optical experiments.\nThese experiments, however, have been for the most part unsatisfactory,\nas it is almost impossible to say how far the results arc due to mere expecta\ntion. In no case thus far have I obtained an optical result which surprised\nmo, nor a result capable of such exact measurement as to prove that it was\neither optically wrong, or more exactly right than my general knowledge\ncould have made it. I mention a few experiments.\n1. Distortion.\u2014If I look in a spoon I see the image distorted in the\nfamiliar way. But I cannot say whether it is distorted precisely as a real\nimage would be. For in the first place the picture does not always appear\nto be on the surface of the spoon or other speculum. For instance, in a\nglobular crystal, or semi-globular ring-stone, the picture appears as on a flat\nsurface. In the second place, I could not, at any rate in the short time\nallowed, draw the distorted picture accurately enough to admit of subsequent\ncomparison with the reflection of the real object itself in the spoon.\n2. Reflection.\u2014If I see a picture under circumstances which suggest that it\nis a reflection, I see it reversed as in a mirror. Thus, in a railway carriage, I\nexperimented with a small crystal and small mirror, both hanging at my\nchatelaine. I easily reproduced in the crystal pictures (not real reflections) of\nthe advertisements on the carriage walls, and just as Lane's Egyptian\n\f48G Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nmagician told him that the crystal \"made left appear right,\" so were these\npictures reversed, and the print appeared as Spiegel-schrift. But I could\nthen reflect the imaginary picture from the crystal into the mirror, and there\nthe letters, \" Compton's Hotel,\" appeared set right again, and legible in the\nordinary way.\nOn the other hand I once suddenly entered a drawing-room where there\nwas a large mirror, and saw a name for which I had been hunting in vain,\nprinted as though on a visiting card fastened on the wall, and not reversed,\nin the middle of the mirror, which thus acted as a speculum. But note\nthat when I saw the word I had for the instant forgotten that there was a\nmirror there, and I took the reflected wall in the mirror for a real wall.\nSo that the picture conformed to my erroneous conception, and not to any\ntrue optical law.\n3. Magnification.\u2014I have used the magnifying-glass 11 times and it has\nalways appeared to magnify. In one case already recorded (Vol.V., p. 513) the\napparent enlargement of the picture enabled me to read significant letters,\nwithout which the picture would have been meaningless. But this, of course,\nmay be classed as merely one form of the picture's development ; that is to\nsay, the letters might have become visible without the magnifying-glass,\nalthough they seemed to be vanishing and to be only just caught. I have\nthroe times used a bogus glass of similar size and appearance, and that glass,\ndid not magnify. However, I have never felt sure that I did not in some\nway distinguish between the true and the false magnifier even in the act of\ncarrying them to my picture.\n4. Double Refraction.\u2014I once tried a flake of Iceland spar, an object\nwhich I had never before handled. I knew, however, its property of double\nrefraction, so that the duplication of the picture which followed may have\nbeen due to expectation, although it looked to me rather more curious than\nI consciously anticipated.\n5. Colour Contrast.\u2014It is my impression that there is retinal fatigue, and\nconsequent sequence of complementary colours, from gazing at crystal-pictures\nas much as from gazing at real objects. I never doubted this until the\nquestion was put to me, although I now find it difficult to prove that uncon\nscious expectation may not account for this also.\nI will first mention spontaneous, and then experimental instances.\nI received one day a visit from a friend in a rather striking blue gown,\nwhich, some hours later, the crystal reproduced. This picture was followed\nby another of the lady's little boy, whom I had not seen lately, dressed in a\nbright orange garment, which I feel sure he cloes not possess.\nAgain, one afternoon someone was talking about Palissy ware. I was not\nspecially addressed, and was staring aimlessly at a dark green, almost black\nglass scent-bottle. I observed in it a picture, all in pale green, of a man\nhastily tearing up some wooden garden palings ; and before I had time to\nwonder what this meant, it was followed by another picture, all in red, of\nthe corner of the library where as a child I kept my books, including one\ndistinctly recognisable, which I have not seen these fifteen years, called\nThe Provocations of Mine. Palissy. Then I remembered that one of this\nlady's provocations consisted in the fact that her husband fed his furnace\nwith the household furniture, or even the fixtures of the house itself.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 487\nThese are the only spontaneous colour-sequences which I can recall, as\nthe pictures do not usually show any one predominating colour. By experi\nment I find that if I tire the retina by staring at a red flower, I see a green\none in the crystal ; and conversely that if I summon up (as I sometimes can do)\na red flower in the crystal, I then see a green patch on the wall. If I use\ntwo crystals there is a similar change of colour between the first picture and\nthe second. Or if I merely desire a change of colour in a crystal-picture I\nfind that blue is followed by orange, yellow by purple, green by red. But\nthis may, of course, be due to unconscious self-suggestion, althougltl am not\nso familiar with the sequence of colours that I could without hesitation name\nthe complement of any given colour.\nThe same result would occur if my blue picture were merely conjured up\nwith closed eyes. On being transferred to the crystal\u2014I, as it were, remaining\nentirely passive\u2014it would appear as orange. When I first discerned this fact\nit was distinctly to my own surprise, and it required a moment's thought to\nassure myself that this was in the natural course of events. It may be\nworth noting that a distinct effort is required to convert a scene\u2014lighted, for\nexample, with red\u2014to its natural colouring or even to a neutral tint. It is\nnecessary to close the eyes or to look away for a moment ; so that what\nfollows is a second edition rather than a prolongation of the first picture.\nOn the other hand, the mere desire for change will produce a green light\nrapidly alternating with the original hue.\n0. Size af Pictures. \u2014The pictures always seem to fit into the crystal, or to\nbe seen within the limits of any larger speculum. They never appear larger\nthan the speculum, nor lose their distinct location, though, if they are fairly\nsimple in outline, I can generally reproduce them at will of any desired size,\nwhen I raise my eyes to any flat background,\u2014as the wall, a screen, &\u00ab., in\nfront of me.\n7. Bise, Duration, and Disappearance.\u2014I have looked at a picture for\neight minutes without its disappearing. I then was tired and looked away.\nGenerally the pictures last two or three minutes. If there is movement in\nthe picture, e.g. , if it represents a street with carriages passing, it usually\nlasts longer than if it represents an inanimate object. Sometimes the\npicture is there suddenly and completely ; others are built up by degrees,\nsometimes with grotesque results. These are generally fanciful pictures,\npartly shaped by my conscious mind. I do not, however, perceive that any\nuse is made of points de reptre. There is a similar variety in their departure.\nSome I can dismiss at will. Some disappear slowly ; and the essential part,\nso to say, may disappear before the accessories. I once stood outside a door\nwith a ground-glass pattern, waiting to hear news of a friend dangerously ill\nwithin. This scene, which I suppose had unconsciously impressed me as\nscenes witnessed in moments of emotion will do, reappeared on the same day\nin the crystal. Then all faded except the pattern on the door ; and when I\ntook the crystal out again at the end of a week the pattern still persisted.\nI have mentioned these points, some of which belong equally to all my\npictures, in connection with the first or lowest class, that of mere memory-\nimages, brighter indeed and more permanent than those which I can summon,\nup \" in my mind's eye,\" but not otherwise very different.\nClass II.\u2014My second class consists of fanciful pictures, and of pictures\n\f4S8 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\u2022of scenes once consciously known, but now forgotten by my ordinary self.\nThe fanciful pictures much resemble illusions hi\/pnagogiqnes, to which I am\nsubject. I can, however, sou the illusions hi\/piutyoyiques in the dark and with\nmy eyes shut, while to see the crystal-pictures I need at least just enough\nlight to make a bright point on the ring or crystal. These fancy pictures in\nthe crystal often take the form of scenes in some little story which I\nhave amused myself by composing. I have quoted in my previous paper one\n\u2022or two cases where the scene thus shown differed from what I had meant to\nhappen in my story. But I have a habit of inwardly visualising imaginary\nscenes ; and these developments in the crystal, though they may strike\nme as unexpected improvements, move within the ordinary limits of my\nthought, like ideas of my own, rather happier than usual.\nSometimes when crystal-vision recovers for me a memory which has not,\nso to say, sunk far out of sight, I get at it by a symbolic picture which shows\nthat my unconscious self has gone through some chain of association, of a\ntrifling but characteristic kind. For instance, I have been studying trees\nlately, and one day was annoyed by a vague impression of having made\nacquaintance with something new and interesting which I could not recall.\nIn the crystal I recognised exactly the spot where I knew that I had seen\nthis interesting tree ; but I could see no trees, only piles and piles of indis\ntinguishable dead leaves. Then the recollection flashed upon me. The tree I\nwanted was the \"red-flowered buck-eye\" chestnut; and the link between\n\u2022dead leaves and chestnut-trees lay in a line of Mrs. Browning's :\n\" Not a grand nature. Not my chestnut woods\n\u00ab )f Vallombrosa \"\u2014\nwhich I had happened to notice a few days previously as a variety on the\nMiltonic picture of Vallombrosa as it looks when the leaves have fallen.\nTrivial as the incident was, it seemed to show that the same sort of verbal\nlinks are used in the association of ideas below as above the conscious\nthreshold.\nHere is a case probably due to forgotten knowledge. Some friends coolly\nsent me a letter addressed \" Dr. Henderson \" (I do not give the real names),\nwith orders to look for the rest in the crystal. I looked, and was rather\nstaggered to read, \"Dr. Henderson, Taunton Gaol.\" I could assign no\ngrounds for such a libel, but on consulting a relative as to what Hendersons\nwe had ever known, she remembered that amongst others \"there was a\nChaplain of that name at Taunton Gaol, but long before your time.\" In ray\npre-crystal days I could have sworn that I had never heard of this chaplain.\nIii this sacond class I miy also count the cases where the crystal has brought\na revival of some sight or word which might easily have reached my conscious\nattention, but has been prevented from so doing by distraction on my part.\nI give four instances of this not uncommon type.\n1. I saw in the crystal a pool of blood (as it seemed to me) lying on the\npavement at the corner of a terrace close to my home. This suggested nothing\nto me. Then I remembered that I had passed over that spot in the course\nof a walk of a few hundred yards home from the circulating library ; and\nthat, the street being empty, I had been looking into the books as I\nwalked. Afterwards I found that my boots and the bottom of my dress were\n-.tained with red paint, which I must have walked through unobservingly\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 48c>\nduring the short trajet just described. I cannot tell which part of me it waft\nthat mistook paint for blood\u2014whether it was my misinterpretation of the\ncrystal-picture, or a mistake in the picture itself.\n2. I saw in the crystal a young girl, an intimate friend, waving to me\nfrom her carriage, I observed that her hair, which had hung down her back\nwhen I last saw her, was now put up in young-lady fashion. Most certainly\nI had not consciously seen even the carriage, the look of which I knew very\nwell. But next day I called on my friend ; was reproached by her for not\nobserving her as she passed ; and perceived that she had altered her hair in\nthe way which the crystal had shown.\n3. Is ext as to sounds not attended to. I was writing at an open window\nand became aware that an elderly relative inside the room had said some\nthing to me. But the noise of the street prevented my hearing, and a wish\nto discourage conversation prevented my asking what had been said. My\nink began to run low, and I took up the inkstand to tip it. Looking into the\nink I saw a white florist's parcel as though reflected on its surface. Going-\ninto another room I there found the parcel in question, of which I had had no\nknowledge. I returned carrying it, and was greeted with the remark, \" I\ntold you half an hour ago to attend to those flowers ; they will all be dead.\"\n4. A relative of mine was talking one day with a caller in the room\nnext to that in which I was reading, and beyond wishing that they were\nfurther I paid no attention to anything they said, and certainly could have\ndeclared positively that I did not hear a word. Next day I saw in a polished\nmahogany table, \" 1, [Earl's]-square, Notting Hill.\" I had no idea whose\nthis address might be. But some days later my relative remarked, \" H.\n(the caller aforesaid) has left Kensington. She told me her address the\nother day, but I did not write it down.\" It occurred to me to ask, \" Was it\n1, [Earl'sJ-square ? \" and this turned out to be the case.\nClass III.\u2014In these cases, and in the somewhat similar case of an\nannouncement of death seen in the Times i (Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 507) I\ncannot prove that I could not, if I had tried, have hoard or seen the word or\nobject which appeared in the crystal without having previously appeared in\nmy consciousness. It may have been distraction, and not sheer sensory\ndisability, which prevented me from noticing these details. But in some\nother cases\u2014and with these I may perhaps begin my third class\u2014I have\ni I may here remind the reader of the large group of ill-understood phenomena\nat present grouped together under the name of Dynamor\/en;\/ (Fere', Rev. H,il., XX.,\n364, &c.) These are cases where either muscular power, as tested by grip of the\ndynamometer, or the acuteness of some one sense, is increased by a stimulus to some\nother sense. Thus the Viennese aurist Urbantschiseh (James's Psychology, II., p. 29 ;\nPfliiger'sArckiv., XLII., p. 154) finds that '' a tuning fork sounded close to the ear will\nsometimes increase acuteness of vision so that letters can be read at a greater distance.\nConversely sounds became audible when lights were exhibited to the eye.\" Simi\nlarly F4r6 finds that inhealthy subjects lost after-images can be recalled by the applica\ntion of a tuning fork in vibration to the top of the head (Palhologiedcs Emotions, p. 29).\nSo with hysterical subjects red light quickens perceptions of taste and smell. And,\nin many healthy subjects an increased acuteness of vision and other senses may\nbe produced by hypnotio suggestion. It is the subliminal self, in my termin\nology, which has to supply this extra acuteness ; and the crystal-vision is merely\nanother way of getting at this reserve of power.\u2014[F. W. H. M.]\n\f490 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nactually tried my best to see or hear something, but failed ; and then the\ncrystal has shown me that something within me has been able to see or\nhear at longer range than I knew.\n1. From a letter, written July 1st, 1891, I take the following account : \" I\nlooked across the room this morning to a distant table, where I expected to\nsee a book I wanted. It was not there, but my eye was caught by another\nbook which I saw was strange to me. I tried, but could not read the title\nat that distance (I have since proved that, even now I know it, this is\nimpossible) ; and turned away to resume my writing. On my blank paper\n\u2014as in a crystal-scene\u2014I read, ' The Valley of Lilies, ' which I found to be\nthe title of the book. I have no recollection of ever seeing the book before,\ncertainly not in this house, though it may have caught my eye in a shop.''\nOn July 2nd I add : \" The book was brought into the house in my absence,\nand placed [by a relative] on her special table, on which my things are never\nput, and which, therefore, I should not necessarily glance at on entering the\nroom, as at my own table, for cards or letters. I did not enter the room\ntill after lunch and, so far as I know, went straight to my own seat, not pass\ning her table, which is in the opposite corner. The book is of rather peculiar\nappearance\u2014an imitation of wood. If I had consciously seen it in a shop I\nshould probably have bought it, for it purports to be by my favourite a\nKempis.\"\n2. I give another instance in which a similar slight extension of the\npower of hearing seems to be involved :\u2014\nIn August, 1891, we went for a few weeks to a small country place, where\nwe had taken a house for the autumn, and which I had never visited before,\nexcept once for a single day. One day a kindly neighbour called to offer us\nthe use of his garden during his own absence from home. As he left the\nhouse he looked up in passing the window, and said something, of which\nneither I nor a girl who was staying with me could catch a single word.\nThe same evening I saw in the crystal a picture of some extraordinarily\ntall and bushy sweet-peas trained over wire fencing\u2014a picture to which I\ncould assign no meaning. The next day we met our friend's housekeeper,\nwho referred to the invitation, and added, \" Mr. P. says he hopes you heard\nhis warning not to lose yourselves among the sweet-peas \" ! On visiting the\ngarden, I found the fencing covered exactly as the crystal had shown, the\nsweet-peas, of which Mr. P. was justly so proud, having been arranged to\nintercept a view of the railway.\nNext above these apparent extensions of faculty\u2014though next with a\ngreat gap between\u2014come the telepathic visions, where some fact quite out\nof my normal cognizance seems to be flashed upon me from another mind\u2014\na mind not necessarily thinking of me at the time. I have had several intima\ntions of this sort otherwise than by crystal-vision since my last paper was\npublished (S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 358) ; but I think only three by\naid of the crystal.\n1. A friend wrote to tell me that\u2014acting on some suggestion of mine\n\u2014she had secured an engagement on a newspaper, adding \" that she\nwas not obliged to fill all her columns with fashions. \" This phrase suggested\nthe Queen, or some paper of the kind ; but the crystal on being interro\ngated showed a magazine about the size of the Engli.ih Illustrated, with\n\fThe Subliminal Conscioitsness. 491\nthe title The Princess. I took this for a cynical joke on the part of\nthe crystal\u2014a \" not quite Queen.\" But I have since found that there is such\na paper, and that my friend is engaged on it. The look of the paper is\ndifferent from what I saw, as though the name only had been transferred\nto me.\n2. On October 12th, 1891, I was discussing the question of crystal-\npictures with a gentleman to whom I had been but that day introduced, and\nof whose friends or surroundings I knew nothing whatever, and who was so\ndeeply interested in the subject that I promised to look into the crystal with\nthe definite hope of seeing something which he might find personally\ninteresting. I was rewarded by three pictures,of which one was as follows :\u2014\nA room containing a high glass screen, round the end of which came,\nafter a few moments, a lady, short, plump, dressed in blue serge dress, with\na short jacket, in the pockets of which she rested her finger-tips : elbows\nstuck out, hair dark, dressed in a low, loose knot, fine dark eyes, and a\nwhite sailor hat. As she walked across the picture, she turned and seemed\nto look at me with some curiosity.\nWe had occasion a few days later to visit Mr. R.'s office on business, when\nI described my pictures. No. 2, the picture above-described, he recognised\nas representing his lady-secretary, though some female clerks in the office\ndenied that she wore a sailor hat. She was not in at the time, but he was\nable to show me the glass screen in the room in which she habitually sat.\nI made her acquaintance later, and found that I was, for special reasons, an\nobject of some curiosity to her, and also that she had had a white sailor hat,\nwhich, only a day or two before my vision, had been blown into the Thames,\nleaving her to walk down the Embankment bareheaded.\nMy other two visions Mr. R. regarded as also reflected from his mind\nand thoughts at the time, but I had not the same degree of proof as in the\none which I have described.\n3. On August 10th of this year D. went with her family to spend the\nautumn at a country house which they had taken furnished, and which\nneither of us had ever seen. I was also away from home, the distance\nbetween us being at least 200 miles.\nOn the morning of the 12th I received a pencil note from her, evidently\nwritten with difficulty, saying that she had been very fiercely attacked by a\nsavage dog, from which she and our own little terrier had defended them\nselves and each other as best they could, receiving a score or so of wounds\nbetween them before they could summon anyone to their assistance. She\ngave me no details, assuming that, as often happens between us, I should\nhave received intimation of her danger before the news could reach me\nby ordinary methods.\nD. was extremely disappointed on hearing that I had known nothing. I\nhad not consulted the crystal on the day of the accident, and had received\nno intimation. Begging her to tell mo nothing further as to the scene\nof her adventure, I sought for it in the crystal on Sunday, 14th, and noted\nthe following details. The attacking dog was a large black retriever, and\nour terrier held him by the throat while D. beat at him in the rear. I saw\nalso the details of D.'s dress. But all this I knew or could guess. What I\ncould not know was that the terrier's collar lay upon the ground, that the\n\f492 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nstruggle took place upon a lawn beyond which lay earth\u2014a garden beii\nprobably\u2014overshadowed by an aucuba bush.\nOn September 9th I had an opportunity of repeating all this to Mr.\nMyers, and on the 10th I joined D. at their country house. The rest of the\nstory I give in her own words : \u2014\n\"As we were somewhat disappointed that no intimation of the accident\nwhich had occurred to me had reached Miss X, she determined to try to\ncall up a mental picture of the scene where it had occurred, and if possible\nto verify it when visiting us later on.\n\" On the night of her arrival at C , we were not able to go over the\nwhole of the grounds alone, and it was therefore not until the following\nmorning that we went together for the special purpose of fixing on the exact\nspot. Miss X. was in front, as I feared some unconscious sign of recogni\ntion on my part might spoil the effect of her choice. The garden is a very\nlarge one, and we wandered for some time without fixing on a spot, the sole\nclue given by Miss X. being that she ' could not get the right place, it\nwanted a light bush.' I pointed out several, silver maples, ,fcc, in various\ndirections, but none would do, and she finally walked down to the place\nwhere the accident had occurred, close to a large aucuba (the ohIy one, I\nbelieve, in the shrubbery), and said, ' This must be it ; it has the path and\nthe grass and the bush, as it should, but I expected it to be much further\nfrom the house.'\n\" I may add that I was not myself aware of this bush, but as I was studying\nthem all at the time we were attacked by the dog, and as this one is close to\nthe spot where I was knocked down, it seems possible that it was the last\nI noticed, and it may therefore have influenced me more than I knew.\"\n[I understand that there are a good many acres of grounds round the\nhouse in question, and that the dog's attack was made within 50 yards of\nthe house\u2014plainly an unlikely place for a struggle so long protracted without\nthe arrival of help.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nThere seems no a priori reason why the induction of manageable\nand instructive hallucinations should be confined to the sense of sight.\nMost of the visual phenomena which led up to crystal-seeing can be\nparalleled with auditory phenomena of the same types. Thus there are\nlight-hearers as well as sound-seers ; and illusions hyjmagogiques\nsometimes take the form of auditory as well as of visual impressions. I\nwill not pursue the subject further until I have more experimental\ncases to compare ; but I am glad to be able to start my collection with\nthe following communication from Miss X., whose example may I hope\nbe followed by others in shell-hearing as profitably as in crystal-vision.\nNotes on Shell-Hearing.\nM. 51.\nIn the course of some widely varied reading on historical methods of\ndivination I have found much that has seemed to me especially interesting\nand suggestive among the stories of voice oracles\u2014not the articulate utter\nances of seer or priestess, which, possibly, find their modern counterpart in\n\" trance mediums \".\u2014but the more mysterious Rumour of Homer, the vocal\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 493\ntrees of Dodonn, the Hebrew Bath Kol, the ' daughter of a voice. ' Coming\nto a later date, the shell divination practised by the Thibetan Buddhists, and\nby the Chinese and Hindus, presents more detail, and brings to mind the\nshells of the Tritons, the shell on the Tower of the Winds at Athens, and the\nstories told of the reverence for shell-sounds among the South Sea Islanders.\nBut still, this all seemed too remote and mysterious to turn to practical\naccount, and it was with a sense of special interest that I read in C. 0.\nLeland's work on Gypsy Sorcery (Fisher Unwin, 1891), that to this day the\ngipsies of Hungary listen for the voice of the Nivasha, or Spirit of the Air, in\nthe sea-shell. To read that interesting results were observed as lately as\n1886 was more stimulating than even the weirdly suggestive \"sound of a\ngoing in the tops of the mulberry trees,\" which inspired the Israelites to\nwar.\nI have naturally exceedingly acute and sensitive hearing, which was\ndeveloped by four years of scientific musical education, and it was with some\nhope that I possessed myself of a smooth-lipped cowrie of a size convenient\nto hold in the palm of the hand, applied it to my ear, and waited.\nFirst came the monotonous murmur of the sea\u2014familiar to childhood ; but\nafter a few minutes of concentrated attention the ear grew accustomed to\nthis sound, which, as it were, became a mere background for those more\narticulate which followed.\nI find the experiment decidedly more fatiguing than that of crystal-gazing,\nand I did not persist on that occasion ; nor do I ever prolong the effort\nbeyond six or eight minutes.\nAfter twenty experiments, I was able to tabulate results as follows :\u2014\n1. On eleven occasions I heard human voices. Theso follow each other\nrapidly in the course of a single experiment, and may be divided into two\ngroups.\n(a) Those to a greater or less degree recognisable ; sometimes coming\nsingly, sometimes rising out of a confused Babel of sound, with the effect\nwith which we are all familiar at any large gathering. These were all pro\nbably recollections of something to which I had in fact listened, though often\nof a kind which might not have come to the surfaco in the ordinary way.\nSometimes I have heard fairly accurate rehearsals of some conversation\nrecently addressed to me, or still more often, which I have overheard. For\ninstance, the shell is more likely after a dinner-party to repeat the conver\nsation of my neighbours on the right than that of my lawful interlocutor\non the left. This, I think, has its analogy in crystal-vision\u2014the crystal\nmore often presents what is unconsciously than what is consciously observed.\n(6) Voices which are unrecognised and are without specially distinguishing\ncharacteristics, and which convey information or advice which my conscious\nself is\u2014though possibly with an effort\u2014quite ablo to supply, such as a\nquotation in verse or prose, a number, an address, or a monition to write a\nletter or send off a parcel.\n2. On nine occasions I heard musical sounds, and I am certain that on\nfive of these the shell definitely supplied an aid to memory\u2014that my shell\nmemory hearing transcended my ordinary memory hearing. I was able to\ndistinguish and readily follow\u2014as I commonly do in a concert-room\u2014first\none part and then another in the chorus or orchestra alternately, and\n2 L\n\f494 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nchanging these at will as I can seldom do without the score, even by a\nconscious effort, more than a few hours after listening to the symphony or\nconcerto.\nIt may be worth while to note that the shell does not, happily, reproduce\nmere street sounds or unpleasant noise of boys and barrel-organs, though I\nam exceedingly impatient of such annoyance. May it not be that, as in\ncrystal-vision, the fatiguo or irritation which might be a source of danger in\nitself suffices to hinder the success of the experiment ?\nAll this, however, might be attributed, in varying degrees, to expectation,\nand as such was disappointing. However, on June 3rd, a slight incident\noccurred which I found encouraging.\nI had been out for a couple of hours, and on returning, let myself in\nwith a latchkey, specially noticed that no letters or cards awaited me, and\nspoko to no one before entering the drawing-room, where my friend A. sat\nreading. It was close on lund\\eon-time, and I took up the shell as a\nmomentary occupation. As I have noticed in crystal-visions, a definite\nfact does not wait to be built up, but is at once thrown out, and the shell\nlost not a moment in greeting me with a clear murmur of \" Endsleigh-\nstreet\u2014Endsleigh-street,\" which I found absolutely unmeaning. Presently\nA. looked up to remark that our friend, G. H., had called, and had waited\nmore than an hour on the chance of my return. \" Has he come up from\nOxford for the day?\" I asked, \"or is he staying (as usual) near here?\"\n\"No,\" said A., \"he has taken rooms in Endsleigh-street.\" So far as I\nknow I have never been in such a street in my life, and I have absolutely no\nassociation with the name. I could hardly suppose the coincidence to be\nmerely accidental.\nA few days later I received further encouragement. On Saturday,\n.Tune 11 th, Mr. G. A. Smith spent some time with us attempting somc\nthought-transference experiments, which were fairly successful, and interested\nmo greatly. Mr. Smith left the house soon after seven. After dinner, I\ntook up the shell which had played some part\u2014not very successfully\u2014in our\nexperiments. What occurred is best given in the following extracts\n\" [June 11th, 1892] Saturday Evening, 8.30. [X to G. A. S.]\n\" Why\u2014when the shell was repeating to me just now what you said about\nclambering over rocks at Ramsgate\u2014did it stop suddenly to ask,still in your\nvoice, ' Are you a vegetarian then ? ' . . . Perhaps you dined at [your\nnext appointment], and declined animal food ? Do tell me whether you\nare responsible for this irrelevance.\"\n\" June 13th, Mondag. [G.A.S. to X.]\n\"... Without doubt the shell spoke the truth. ... As you know, I\nleft you soon after 7. After walking some 15 minutes I suddenly met Mr. M.\n... I was thinking about points in connection with the experiments we\nhad been engaged in, and am afraid I did not follow his remarks very closely\n. . . but he made someallusion to little dishes at a vegetarian restaurant some\nwhere, and immediately feeling an interest in the question whether he was\na champion of the vegetarian cause, I interrupted him with ' Are you\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 495\na vegetarian then ? ' I believe these are the exact words I used. Ho will be\nsure to remember this, and must be questioned.\"\n\" June 23rd. [G. A. S. to X.]\n\" I have to-day walked over the course which I took on June 11th, from\n[your house] to the spot where I met Mr. M. It took just 11 minutes. If\nI left you at 7.15, it was probably about 7-30, or a very few minutes later,\nthat I put the query to Mr. M.\"\nMr. M. was away from home, and though at once applied to for corro\nboration, did not send a written statement till June 22nd, when he writes\nto Mr. Smith (after failing to recall the exact particulars of the previous\nconversation) :\u2014\n'' The main fact remains that you asked me, to the best of my belief\u2014\nbearing on my strong praise of the cooking at the Oxford-street CafcS\u2014whether\n'I was a vegetarian.' That is the core of the whole matter, and that is\nsound.\"\nThe very triviality and grotesqueness of the incident suggests points for\nspeculation outside of its connection with shell-hearing, which, however,\naffords a curious example of a means of arriving at unexpected knowledge.\nI have since recorded about fifty further experiments, but those already\ndescribed may be taken as typical of the whole series. Not above half-a-\ndozen could be counted as evidences of telepathy, perhaps twenty may be\nclassed among recrudescent memories which might never otherwise have\nbeen brought to light, and another dozen may be considered the result of\nmere expectation. The remainder have all consisted of musical sounds, some\nof which have been purely fanciful. These have been very definite in\ncharacter, so much so that I have succeeded in reproducing them on the\npiano, or in scoring them at the moment, but they in no way differ from what\nI might extemporise in the ordinary way.\nOn two occasions only have I heard reasonable consecutive sentences for\nwhich I could not at the time account in connection either with memory or\nimagination, but in both cases I ultimately discovered their origin ; the one\nin a book, the other on the fourth sheet of a letter which I had supposed to\nbe finished on the third, but which I might conceivably have read in taking\nthe letter from its envelope, though I cannot remember having done so.\nI have as yet no other examples of the deliberate induction of\n.auditory hallucinations by shell-hearing or any similar artifice. But\nthis externalisation of inward auditions could doubtless be cultivated\nin the same way as crystal vision,\u2014of which, indeed, it formed an\naccompaniment in the case above cited from Professor Janet. I should\nnot wish at present to recommend the practice except to thoroughly\nsound and strong persons, as the frequency of insistent voices as an\nearly symptom of insanity rather suggests that induced voices may be\nless easy to keep in check than induced visions have thus far proved to\nbe. At the same time, I have known several sane and healthy persons\nwho have experienced spontaneous externalised voices, either rarely or\nfrequently, with no resulting injury. One of these was the late Rev.\n2 L 2\n\f49G Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nP. H. Newnham, so often cited in these Proceedings, and assuredly-\none of the sanest and calmest of men. Some discussion of this topic\nwill )mi found in Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 305. I will content myself\nhere with citing two cases,\u2014the first curiously parallel to Miss X's\ncase of the sweet-peas, given above, as implying a slight subliminal\nextension of the auditory field ; and the second, as I construe it,\nillustrating that revival of forgotten memories of which mention has\nso often been made.\nThe first case consists of a letter from Mr. Newnham, written about\n1884:\u2014\nL. *\nC\nOwing to my spinal malady, I am sometimes obliged to use two walking-\nsticks ; and can only crawl up the steep hills of this parish with much diffi\nculty and pain. One winter evening (probably in December, 1882) I was\ncreeping home about 5 p.m., when I saw in the distance a lot of some\n20 young apprentices from the boatyard in my parish coming home after\nthe day's work. Instantly the voice said to me, \"They are saying, 'Here\ncomes old Four-legs.' \" Sure enough, as they'passed me, one said, \"There\ngoes old Four-legs.\" Now, I had never heard this nickname before, or\nimagined anything like it.\nThis last is, of course, simply a case of thought-transference, identifying\nitself with the voice as its vehicle. I am not quite sure whether the words\nwere spoken to me ab extra in this case. My memory is not quite clear.\nThis may, as Mr. Newnham supposes, have been a case of thought-\ntransference. But I rather incline to suppose that the hoys were\nuttering the words just out of \"earshot,\" but within the subliminal\nauditory field. I need hardly add that an incident so incapable of\nexternal corroboration derives its value from the known care and\naccuracy of the percipient\u2014one of the best informants whom we have\never encountered.\nThe next case is from an informant of whom we know less, and has\ntwice been printed in part ; once in the Blackburn Times, soon after the\nevent, and once in the Review of Reviews. We have now obtained an\nimportant corroboration ; and the date of the incident has been ap\nproximately fixed in September or October, 1883. Mr. Wolstenholme\nwrites to Professor Sidgwick from 62, King-street, Blackburn,\nDecember 3rd, 1891 :\u2014\nP. 143.\nA few years ago, at tho time the following incident occurred, I was\nresiding at 4 and 6, Preston New-road, Blackburn.\nAfter explaining a call of business which summoned him to Preston, Mr.\nWolstenholme continues :\u2014\nAt that time I was keoping a pony \" Fanny,\" and as I had not much\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 497\nwork for her I determined to drive over to Preston, a distance of nine miles.\nOn the morning of the trial I yoked \"Fanny\" to the trap in a passage\nbehind my house. On each side of the passage is a wall about eight feet\nhigh, the wall on one side forming the boundary to the backs of the houses,\nthe wall on the other side forming the boundary to a largo wood yard. I\nhad everything ready for starting on my journey, and had gone into the\nhouso for a knee-rug and my whip. When I returned with these articles,\nand was standing in tho trap arranging the rugs, &e., I heard what sounded\nlike the voice of a man speaking within a foot of my oars these words :\n\"Put some string in your pocket.\" I immediately turned round to see who\nwas speaking, but to my surprise there was no one in the passage or any\nwhere in tho neighbourhood.\nA cab-stand is in tho open street at the bottom of the passage, and\nthinking it must be one of the \" cabbies \" who had spoken, I got out of the\ntrap and went to the bottom of the passage to see who tho person was. The\ncab-stand was empty, not a cab about, and the only person I could see was\na lady who was 70 or 80 yards up the street on the opposite side.\nThere was no one about to account for the voice, neither was there any\napparent cause that I was aware of why I should put the string in my\npocket. I went into the house again and told my wife what I had heard.\nHer reply was, \" Well, take some string with you, it will bono great weight\nto carry,\" so I put several yards in my pocket.\nI arrived in Preston all right, and drove to the Dog Hotel, and gave\n\"Fanny\" into the hands of the ostler. After the trial was over we all\nreturned to the \"Dog\" to tea, and at 20 minutes to 9 I commenced my\njourney home. The night was very dark, but as I had good lamps with\nme I did not heed the darkness. \"Fanny\" trotted along the road at a\nbrisk speed, and all was going on well, when suddenly she stopped, and\nno matter how I used the whip or coaxed her she would not stir another\nstep forward, but began to back until she backed the trap into the hedge\non the road side.\nI jumped out, and taking one of the lamps ran to her head to see what\nwas the matter. I immediately found that the strap which stretches from\nthe horse's collar, and is secured to the bottom end of the shafts, the\ntrace by which the trap is dragged along, had broken inside a piece of\nmetal which connected it with the collar. The defect being covered by\nthe metal plate had escaped my observation, and I had no idea that any\nthing was wrong with the harness in any part.\nI removed the broken strap, and I now saw a use for the string I had in\nmy pocket. With it I rigged up a temporary arrangement by means of\nwhich \"Fanny\" was able to take the trap and myself homo. Had I not\ntaken the string with mo I should have had to leave the trap on the road side\n\"and walk home a distance of six miles.\nWho or what spoke I know not ; all I know is that the \" voice \" sounded\nclose to me, not more than a foot from my ears, and was a man's voice. The\nnearest person I could see was a lady, and she was 70 or 80 yards away.\nYou are at liberty to use this article if you think fit.\nR. WoLSTenHOLMk.\n\f493 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n62, King-street, Blackburn,\nDecember 30th, 1891.\nI was at home on the evening of Mr. M.'s lawsuit in 1883, and dis\ntinctly remember hearing my father tell my mother about the accident to the\nharness. The circumstance of the warning voice made the incident very\nremarkable, and one not easily forgotten ; since then I have heard both of\nmy parents on many occasions relate the circumstance and never have\neither of them doubted that my father heard the voice.\nMary Jane Wolstenholme.\nP.8.\u2014I do not remember any accident to the harness bofore that time\nand had no reason to suspect one then. R. Wolstenholme.\nMrs. Wolatenholmo is now dead, so that Miss VV.'s is the only corrobora\ntion now attainable.\nThis case is by no means unlike the subliminal discovery of hidden ob\njects, of which we have had several examples. The weak place in the\nharness, although \" hidden behind a metal plate,\" was, perhaps, not so\ncompletely hidden but that it may have been \" unconsciously \" noted.\nCase III.\u2014Miss A.\nXVI.\u2014In the next case which I propose to give at length, crystal-\nvision forms but a small, and an ill-recorded, part of a long and complex\ngroup of phenomena centering in a lady who wishes here to be known\nas Miss A. I have had the privilege of an intimate acquaintance with\nMiss A and her family for eight years, and have personally witnessed\nmany of these phenomena. But it must be remembered that I am no\nlonger dealing, as in the two previous cases, with records of experi\nments undertaken at my own request, and for a definite scientific\npurpose. On the contrary, I have here merely been invited to hear or\nto witness fragments of a continuous series of phenomena, which have\nbeen observed only for private interest and satisfaction, and to which\nMiss A and her family were long unwilling to give any kind of\npublicity. I have now to thank them for permission kindly accorded\nto print the following pages. But the material which has been pre\nserved forms but a fraction of the whole, and was not originally\nselected with n view to scientific proof. In Miss A's ease, as in that\nof Mr. Stainton Moses, with which I shall afterwards have to deal,\nit has been to the dogmatic content of automatically written messages\nthat most attention has been given. That, also, is important in its\nway ; but it belongs to a later stage of our inquiry. For the present I\nhave confined myself mainly to crystal-visions, and have asked\nMiss A to reply to certain questions, and to give such instances of\nveridical visions as now admit of corroboration. For convenience'\nsake, I have interspersed between square brackets some notes made by\nthe Countess of Radnor, the friend in whose presence many of the\n\fT\/ie Subliminal Consciousness. 499\nphenomena occurred, and who has revised these pages, and some\nunsigned notes of my own.\nM. 52.\n1. Health.\u2014I do not know if my health affects the crystal-seeing ; I am\nso seldom ill that I have not tried. If I have a headache I never look in\nthe crystal ; but I should imagine I should seo equally well anyway.\n2. Visualising Power, d-c.\u2014I see in the crystal rrnich more distinctly than\nI could ever imagine things. I am a very bad visualiser ; and when I think\nof people I do so much more by the sound of their voice than by their faces\nor figures. I don't think I ever imagined a group in motion in my life. I\nam very short-sighted, and seldom wear glasses ; consequently, I rarely get a\nclear picture of any room or scene. But when I look in the crystal I seo every\nthing as clearly as though I had strong glasses on. I cannot bo sure whether\neither my short sight or my visualising power is better in dreams than in\nwaking hours ; but I think both are better. Certainly, however, I never see\nin dreams any scene at all comparable in clearness to what I see in the\ncrystal.\nI have no artistic gift, although I have received a few lessons in drawing\nand painting. I have automatically drawn flowers, figures, a snake, &c.,\nmuch better than I can draw by conscious effort. [These drawings will be\ndescribed along with the automatic writings.]\n3. Visions Apart from Crystal or Oiher Sjxxulnm.\u2014I have sometimes,\ngenerally as the result of effort, seen hallucinatory figures\u2014all of them, I\nbelieve, in some sense veridical, never mere subjective hallucinations,\u2014stand\ning or sitting in the room. And I have, once at least, seen the room itself\nalter. I saw a largo modern room change into the likeness (as shown after\nwards by independent record) of what it was 200 years ago ; and I saw\npersons in it who apparently belonged to that date.\n[Tho history of the room was known to Lady Radnor, who attests :\n\" Miss A has, without looking into anything, described a room, whose history\nwas unknown to her, as I have reason to believe that it was 200 years ago.\nIt was the Long Parlour at Longford, which in 1670 was used as tho chapel.\n\u2014H. M. Radnor.\" Other visions of this kind will be dealt with later.]\n4. First Discovery of the Power.\u2014It is now some years since I first began\nto look in the crystal. I had already written automatically, but knew nothing\nof crystal-vision. I happened one day to be lunching with some friends who\ntalked on the subject, and said that they believed that a glass of clear water\nacted in the same manner. Two or three of us looked in glasses of water,\nand after a little while I seemed to see at the bottom of my glass a\nsmall gold key. This was so distinct that I looked on tho tablecloth,\nthinking that there must be a real key there. There was none, and nothing\nto explain what I saw.\n5. Speculum and Mode of Gazing.\u2014We bought a glass ball, and I gradually\nbegan to see a good deal in it. I have since seen in several crystals, in a\nmoonstone in a bracelet, &c. [I have known her see things in a polished\ntable.\u2014H. M. Radnor.] It does not seem to matter much what the smooth\nsurface is ; but I have sometimes fancied that the scenes were brighter if seen\n\f500 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nin a real crystal. Occasionally I see things in a mirror, or even without any\nclear surface, as though I were in the midst of them.\nI either take the crystal into a dark corner of the room, or wrap it up in\nblack with only a little bit uncovered, or if it is small I hold it inside my\nhand and look right into it. I can see equally well in the dark. After a\nminute or two I seem to see a very bright light in it, which disappears after\na few seconds, and then the surface appears cloudy and thick. This mist\nclears away, and I see sometimes views, sometimes faces, sometimes letters,\nand all kinds of things in it. They only last for a few seconds or sometimes\nminutes, and between each new picture I see the same light and then mist.\nI cannot look in the crystal for long, as it makes my eyes water with the\nbrightness of the light and gives me a feeling as if a band wore tied round\nmy head ; but if I only look a little while it does not hurt me at all. The\ncrystal seems to become a globe of light. If a sunlit scene appears, the\nlight may continue, or it may disappear before the figure shows itself. [Her\neyes often stream with tears from \" the brightness of the light.\"\u2014H. M.\nRadnor.] I am in a perfectly normal condition when I look ; not sleepy,\nnor in a trance, nor unconscious of my surroundings.\n0. Magnification, &c.\u2014I have tried the magnifying-glass. The results\nare just the same as without it ; only the glass being on the top I suppose I\nsee in it instead of in the crystal. I cannot tell when people ask me whether\nthe figures which I see are big or small ; for I feel as if I were in some way\nclose to them ; so I cannot define their size. [I have often remarked that\nwhen Miss A looks in the crystal she describes things not as if she saw them\nin a picture, but as if she were actually there, and the places and people\nwere round her.\u2014H. M. Radnor.] Before the figures come I see the\ncrystal in my usual short-sighted manner, so that, for instance, I could not\ndistinguish my own reflection in it. But the figures are quite clear ; and I\ncan follow a figure even if it appears to be walking to a great distance. But if\nI specially look at some detail in the picture, that detail generally seems to\nget clearer to me.\nIf I move my eyes from the crystal, or if I close my eyes, the picture\ndisappears. If I move the crystal about I seem to shake the picture out of\nit. When the picture is once lost I can seldom get it again. Once or twice\nI have succeeded in doing so, but there have always been other pictures\nbetween.\n7. Verbal Messages in the Crystal.\u2014When I see writing in the crystal\nI see it only one letter at a time ; and when the letters are put down they\nare found to be words spelt backwards.\n[Each letter in turn seems to fill the crystal ; and the letters succeed each\nother so rapidly that it is hard to take them down from Miss A's dictation.\nThe words may come to explain a picture, or may form a message by them\nselves. The backward spelling is probably adopted in order to prevent\nMiss A's supraliminal intelligence from guessing at, and thereby disturbing,\nthe message which is being given.]\n8. General Clinracteristics of the Pictures.\u2014Sometimes the things which\nI see are interesting, and sometimes just the reverse ; sometimes true and\nsometimes not. If I wish to see a particular person, I cannot do so, but I\nprobably see something quite different. I cannot tell if what I am seeing is\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 501\npast, present, or future. I do not think that the pictures have anything to\nclo with what I read and see in the ordinary way.\n[I can expand this statement from personal observation. When Miss A\nlooks in crystal or ring there is almost always a continual series of pictures,\neach generally quite disconnected from its predecessor, although\noccasionally several scenes of the same story may follow each other. No\ncomplete record has been made of these pictures ; and therefore in\nestimating the probability that the coincidence which somo of them show\nwith fact is not due to chance alone, we can make no exact calculation of\npercentages ; but after making the Largest reasonable allowance for the cases\nin which no coincidence has been observed, it appears to me that in many\ninstances the details seen, and the verbal explanations automatically given,\nare so full and precise that accident cannot be invoked to explain them. The\nunintelligible pictures, on the other hand, remind one of a series of views\nthrown on the table of a camera obscura ; but whether the views come from\nthe macrocosm or the microcosm, from the solid world or from the subliminal\nimagination, there is generally nothing to show.]\n!). [Let us consider the cases which have a prima facie claim to bo\nveridical. These may represent scenes past\u2014beyond the range of hyper-\nmnesia,\u2014scenes present\u2014whether derived from another mind cognisant of\nthem, or from some kind of direct extended perception ; and possibly things\nfuture ;\u2014although (besides Lady Barnby's case given below) only one appa\nrently clear case of precognitive picture\u2014foretelling a death then absolutely\nunexpected\u2014has been observed.\nInasmuch as telepathy and clairvoyance are ideas less unfamiliar than\neither retrocognition or precognition, it may be well to take first some pictures\nof events soon about the time of their occurrence. Such record of these as\nI can offer at present is unfortunately extremely incomplete. Miss A has\nnever made a continuous series of experiments with a friend at a distance,\nand has no belief that deliberate experimentation of this kind would succeed.\nYet, on the other hand, Miss A herself and her family have naturally been\nreluctant to test the accuracy of pictures which professed to relate to\nstrangers,\u2014who either might not exist or might dislike the inquiry. There\nis, nevertheless, no reason to suppose that the subliminal self is less regard\nful of others than the supraliminal ; nor have pictures, I think, ever occurred\nwhose possible verification could have caused pain. Just as in the hypnotised\nsubject the feeling of the bieivs&inces seems the most persistent element of\ncharacter, so also among all the incoherences of automatic message by script\nor vision a certain control of this kind seems to be exercised by the hidden\nagency. Returning to the present case, the result of the limitations above\nmentioned is that I can hardly quote more than the few instances where\nLady Radnor happens to have been able to identify the scene from her own\nexperience or that of friends.]\nA. Picture of scene probably passing at the moment.\nSome time ago I was looking in my crystal and saw Lady Radnor sitting\nin a room I had never seen, in a big red chair ; and a lady in a black dress\nand white cap whom I had never seen came in and put her hand upon Lady\nR.'s shoulder. It was about 7.30, I think. I immediately, that same evening,\nwrote to Lady R. to ask her to write down what she was doing at 7.30, as I\n\f502 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nhad seen her in the crystal. Shortly afterwards I saw Lady R., and she said\nshe had done as I askod her, and told me to tell her what I saw. It was quite\nright ; she had been sitting in a red armchair, and Lady Jane E. , dressed as I\ndescribed her, had come in and put her hand on her shoulder. Afterwards,\nwhen I met Lady Jane E., I recognised her, without knowing who she was,\nas the lady I had seen. Also, when I went to the house I recognised the\nchair.\n[This is perfectly correct. Miss A had never been to Longford when\nshe described my room, which was right in every particular, even to the fact\nthat my chair was quite touching the corner of the high fender.\u2014H. M.\nRadnor.]\n[Lord Radnor tells me that he remembers the incident perfectly. The\nchair was of a kind unusual in a bedroom. The description of the lady\nentering was right as to personal appearance as well as dress.]\nB. Second cordempoi aneous scene.\nIn one case I saw and described Mr. B (a well-known writer), whom I\nknew slightly, as hunting for a paper in the drawers of a writing-table. He\nused a particular pen, which I described, and with his hands ruffled his hair\ntill it stood up in a kind of halo. A lady came in and pointed to his hair and\nlaughed. Lord Radnor inquired of Mr. B, and all this was found to be\ncorrect. He was writing with a pen unusual to him (silver instead of quill,\nor vice versa), and was looking for a paper which he wanted to send by post.\nHis sister (I did not know that she lived with him, and had never seen her)\nentered the room, and pointed laughing to his hair, just as I had seen.\n[Confirmed.\u2014H. M. Radnor.]\nA group of cases may here conveniently be given together, as included\nm the same narrative. Case C is probably exactly contemporaneous. Case\nD also seems contemporaneous. Case E is retrocognitive, and case F seems\nprecognitive.\nC. Sir Joseph Barnby, the well-known musician, writes as follows :\u2014\nNovember, 1892.\nI was invited by Lord and Lady Ridnor to the wedding of their daughter,\nLady Wilma Bouverie, which took place August 15th, 1889.\nI was met at Salisbury by Lord and Lady Radnor and driven to Longford\nCastle. In the course of the drive, Lady Radnor said to me : \"We have a\nyoung lady staying with us in whom, I think, you will be much interested.\nShe possesses the faculty of seeing visions, and is otherwise closely connected\nwith the spiritual world. Only last night she was looking in her crystal and\ndescribed a room which she saw therein, as a kind of London dining-room.\n[The room described was not in London but at L., and Miss A particularly\nremarked that the floor was in large squares of black and white marble\u2014as it\nis in the big hall at L., where family prayers are said.\u2014H. M. Radnor.]\nWith a little laugh, she added, ' And the family are evidently at prayers, the\nservants are kneeling at the chairs round the room and the prayers are\nbeing read by a tall and distinguished-looking gentleman with a very hand\nsome, long grey beard.' With another little laugh, she continued : ' A\nlady just behind him rises from her knees and speaks to him. He puts\nher asido with a wave of the hand, and continues his reading. ' The young\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness.\nlady here gave a careful description of the lady who had risen from her\nknees.\nLady Radnor then said: \"From the description given, I cannot help\nthinking that the two principal personages described are Lord and Lady L.,\nbut I shall ask Lord L. this evening, as they are coming by a later train,\nand I should like you to be present when the answer is given.\"\nThat same evening, after dinner, I was talking to Lord L. when Lady\nRadnor came up to him and said : \" I want to ask you a question. I am afraid\nyou will think it a very silly one, but in any case I hope you will not ask mo\nwhy I have put the question 1 \" To this Lord L. courteously assented. She\nthen said : \"Were you at home last night? \" He replied, \"Yes. \" She said :\n\"Were you having family prayers at such a time last evening?\" With a\nslight look of surprise he replied, \"Yes, we were.\" She then said: \"During\nthe course of the prayers did Lady L. rise from her knees and speak to you,\nand did you put her aside with a wave of the hand?\" Much astonished,\nLord L. answered: \"Yes, that was so, but may I inquire why you have\nasked this question?\" To which Lady Radnor answered : \" You promised\nyou wouldn't ask me that ! \"\nD. The day following was the day of the wedding, and at a dinner party\nheld in the evening my attention was called by Lady Radnor to Miss A, who-\nseemed to be listening to something. On inquiring the cause, Lady Radnor\nasked me \" If I had not heard the raps,\" as she supposed Miss A \"was\nreceiving a message.\"\nI had not heard the raps, but I begged to be made acquainted as soon\nafter dinner as possible with the purport of the message.\nOn rejoining tho ladies, I inquired at once what the message might be ?\nLady Radnor replied : \" The message is somewhat mysterious and there is a\nportion of it we cannot make out, but the general purport is : ' There is danger\nin the \u2014\u2014 reservoir belonging to the Liverpool Waterworks Company.'\"\nAbout twenty minutes later the additional message was rapped out : \"The\ndanger is in the left-hand corner.\" Here I laughed the laugh of the scornful,\nand remarked : \" There is a beautiful vagueness about that, seeing that it\ndepends entirely upon which side of a parallelogram you stand before you\ncan determine the left-hand corner ! \" Four days later [According to my\nrecollection (too days later only.\u2014H. M. Radnor.] a paragraph appeared in\nmost of the London dailies to the effect that the inhabitants of were in\na state of considerable alarm on account of some signs of weakness having\nappeared in the [Welsh] reservoir belonging to tho Liverpool Waterworks\nCompany. They had sent a deputation to the company requesting that an\nexpert should be got down from London to examine the defect. Needless to\nsay, Miss A had never heard of the name of the place, \"an unpronounceable\nWelsh name,\" had no interest in that part of the country, and had never\nbeen in the neighbourhood.\nE. Two days after the wedding I was driven by Lady Radnor and Miss A to\nSalisbury Cathedral to play on the organ, a magnificent specimen of cathedral\norgans. I was much interested in tho instrument and became absorbed in my\nplaying. At the end of two hours I rejoined the ladies, who had been sitting\nin the body of the vast church. On our drive back to Longford, Lady\nRadnor asked Miss A why she was so silent and thoughtful, to which Miss A\n\f504 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nanswered : \" I have had such strange experiences in the Cathedral during the\ntime Mr. Barnby was playing.\" On being asked to relate them, Miss A\nbegged to be excused until she arrived at the Castle, as the grinding of the\ncarriage wheels over the newly metalled roads made it difficult to hear one\nanother speak.\nWhether this promise was forgotten, or whether callers put it out of her\nhead, I cannot say, but I left Longford without hearing any more of the\nmatter. Eleven months later Lady Radnor, during a call upon my wife, told\nme the following : \" Miss A's statement was to the effect that she had seen\nvast processions of gorgeously apparelled Catholic ecclesiastics with jewelled\ncrosses carried before them, gorgeous canopies and baldachinos held over\nthem and clouds of incense filling the place. Amongst the dignitaries was\none who came near them and gazed at them with a singularly sad expression\nof countenance. On being asked why ho looked so sad, he said : \" I have\nbeen a great sinner. I was greatly responsible for the beheading of Anne\nBoleyn. What adds to the sadness of it, her father and I were boys together,\nand our homes were in close proximity to each other.\" On being asked his\nname, he said : \" My name is John Longland.\" On being further questioned\nhe replied : \"Mr. Barnby's music brought me here. I often hear it in\nEton Chapel.\"\nLady Radnor then went on to say : \" I was naturally desirous of finding\nout who this John Longland might be, but after several unsuccessful efforts\nI was beginning to despair of solving the mystery, when, five months later, I\nfound it recorded in a long, thin, worm-eaten book [I found the book in an old\nlobby cupboard at Longford. It was there recorded that John Longland had\nbeen Dean of Salisbury in the reign of Henry VIII., and also that he had\nbeen translated to the See of Lincoln.\u2014H. M. Radnor.] containing the name\nof John Longland, Dean of Salisbury in the reign of King Henry the Eighth.\"\nThis was sufficiently extraordinary ; but on my inquiring what connection he\nhad with Eton, her ladyship remarked that she had already told me all she\nknew. Thereupon I said, \"I wonder if he is mentioned in Maxwell Lyte's\nHistory af Eton College ? \" and I rose at once to get the book. There I\nfound he was mentioned on pages 103 and 124 as having been Dean of\nSalisbury and Confessor to King Henry the Eighth. He was soon translated\nto the more dignified see of Lincoln, which carried with it the appointment\nof \"Visitor to Eton College.\" It appears that during one of his visits he\ncalled upon the Fellows to make up their number which had fallen from 10\nto 7(?) (See Maxwell Lyte's Historg.) This they explained they were unable\nto do as the value of their property had decreased and they were conse\nquently unable to pay their full number. The Bishop came forward with the\nnecessary funds. He likewise gavo largely to the other members of the\ncollege, the ministers of the \"queero,\" and even the bell-ringers were not\nforgotten ; and by his will ho left money for the annual performance of a\nrequiem Mass on each anniversary of his death, and gave instructions like\nwise that his heart should be buried \"afore the holy aultar in Lincoln\nCathedral and his body in Eton College Chapel.\" All of which was done.\nHis grave at Eton was covered by a magnificent brass, which, by an act of\nvandalism, was destroyed about 200 years ago. Here, then, is the explana\ntion of his connection with Eton and his love of music.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 505\nF. One more incident in connection with the extraordinary powers of this\nyoung lady remains to be noted. Whilst looking in her crystal during one\nof the days I spent at Longford, she described, amongst a number of things\nunnecessary to mention, a room which appeared to her to be a bedroom.\nShe appeared to be viewing the room from just outside the open door, for she\nsaid : \"If there be a bed in the room it must be behind the door on the\nleft \" ; in any case the room was a long one and the end of it was occupied\nby a large window which formed the entire end of the room. She added :\n\"There is a lady in the room, drying her hands on a towel.\" She described the\nlady as tall, dark, slightly foreign in appearance and with rather \"an air\"\nabout her. This described with such astonishing accuracy my wife, and\nthe room she was then occupying at an hotel at Eastbourne, that I was im\npelled to ask for particulars as to dress, &c. She stated that the dress was\nof serge with a good deal of braid on the bodice and a strip of braid down\none side of the skirt. This threw me off the scent, as before I had started\nfor Longford my wife had expressed regret that she had not a serge dress\nwith her. My astonishment, therefore, was great on returning to East\nbourne to find my wife wearing a serge dress exactly answering to the\ndescription given above. The sequel to this incident comes some sixteen\nmonths later on, when my wife and I attended a performance given by the\nMagpie Minstrels (a society of musical amateurs) at Princes' Hall, Piccadilly.\nWe arrived early, and after placing my wife in a seat I moved about the\nroom speaking to friends here and there. In the course of ten minutes or\nho, Lady Radnor and Miss A entered the room. During tho greetings\nwhich ensued, Miss A called my attention to a standing figure, saying :\n\"You will remember my seeing a lady in her bedroom while looking in\nmy crystal ; that is the lady I saw.\" That too* my wife! I only need add\nthat she had never seen my wife. Joseph Barnby.\nLady Barnby writes as follows in corroboration of the incident relating\nto her own dress :\u2014\n9, St. George's-square, S.W.\nSaturday, November 12lh, 1892.\nThe account about me and my dress is remarkable as being out of the\ngeneral course of things in this way : I had been remarking to Sir Joseph\nthat it was a mistake to come to the seaside without a serge dress, that being\na material particularly suited for wear at the seasido, but I added : \" I do not\nthink there is much use in ordering one now, as Madame D. will be gone for\nher holiday, it being August.\" Sir Joseph left tho next day for Longford,\nand I wrote to Madame D., telling her to make me this gown. She got the\nletter Tuesday [August 13th, 1889], and in the marvellously short time by\nSaturday, I received my gown. Then again, it is not usual in an hotel\nto have one's bedroom door open when one is occupying tho room,\nbut the reason for it on this occasion was the fact that I was to meet\nSir Joseph on his return from Longford [Tuesday, August 20th] (as a\n\u2022urprae in this new serge gown) and having no clock in our bedroom, which\nwas at the end of the corridor, with my daughter's room at an angle to ours,\nwhere she slept with her maid, I\u2014thinking I was somewhat late for meeting\nthe train\u2014opened the door to call to the maid to tell me the time as I washed\n\f506 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nmy hands standing at the washhand-stand in a line with the open door. I\nclo not suppose I have ever done such a thing at an hotel before or since.\nEdith Mary Barney.\n[These dates have been confirmed by Lady Barnby from her diary. Lady\nBarnby also tells me that her nurse confirms the little incident of the\nwearing of the serge dress first on August 20th. The crystal-scene, there\nfore, seems to have anticipated a certain definite moment, which happens\nto have been well remembered. But, of course, each apparently precognitive\n\u2022case must be judged in connection with all the rest. See Proceedings,\nVol. V., p. 288.]\nE. In February, 1890, Lady Radnor gave me the following independent\naccount of the Longland incident. Sir J. Barnby had not seen this account\nwhen his was written (in November, 1892) :\u2014\n\" In August, 1889, when Mr. Barnby was here (from Eton College) Miss\nA had some writing of that kind which can only be road reflected in a\nlooking - glass, and written in a curling, snake-like way, from John\nLongland, who said he was brought through tho influence of Mr. Barnby,\nwhoso beautiful music he heard at Eton as he was buried there. He wished\nto say that ho had written letters to his friend Anne Boleyn's father, and\nthat it was owing to him in great measure that Henry VIII. divorced\nCatherine, married Anno, and afterwards beheaded her, &c. Unfortunately\nthese papers were destroyed. As inquiries having been made at Eton, and no\ntomb of John Longland found, again we thought we had been misled. Next\ntime, in August, 1889, he came at the Cathedral, announcing his presence by\nraps :\nQ. Who are you ? A. John Longland. Q. What were you ! A. Dean\nof Salisbury. Q. When 1\n3\nA. 15(19) ? (39) ? Could not quite ma&e out which.\n\" We could not find out anything about John Longland [by inquiries at\nEton], and though he came many times we thought it unsatisfactory and\nwould not listen to him.\n\"This morning, February 24th, 1890, I was looking through a list\nof tho Deans of Salisbury Cathedral (History of Salisbury Cathedral :\nDodsworth, 1815). I found [Appendix III.] that in 1514 a.d. John\nLongland teas Dean of Salisbury and was made Bishop of Lincoln\nin 1521. [He was made Henry VIII.'s Confessor in 1519, accord\ning to Chalmers' Biographical Dictionary.] I then turned to Brit-\nton's History of Lincolnshire and found on page 623 that ' John Longland,\nDean of Salisbury, was consecrated May 3rd, 1521. A man of learning, but\ngenerally blamed for taking advantage of his situation as Confessor to Henry\nVIII. to promote tho divorce between that monarch and his Queen\nCatherine. . . . Dying at Woburn, he was privately interred in Eton\nCollege Chapel.'\"\n[These cases suggest a few remarks. Case C (Lord L. at prayers). \u2014This\nincident has been independently recounted to me both by Lady Radnor and\nby Miss A herself. Another small point not given by Sir J. Barnby is that\nMiss A did not at first understand that family prayers were going on, but\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 507\nexclaimed: \"Here .are a number of people coming into the room. Why,\nthey're smelling their chairs ! \" This scene may have been exactly contem\nporaneous. If we assume any intelligent guidance of all this subliminal\ncognition, this is one of the few scenes which seem to have been presented\nexpressly for the purpose of verification ; but the verification, of course,\ndepended upon Lady Radnor's presence. Nor does it appear that any\nindication is given as to when a message will prove verifiable. The pictures\nseem to come at haphazard, and no' wishing or asking for \"tests\" will secure\nthem.\nCase D.\u2014The intimation of danger in certain waterworks was not given\nby crystal-vision and is only inserted here as forming part of Sir J. Barnby's\naccount. The difficult question as to the nature of so-called \"raps\" may\nbo deferred till the next chapter. But it must be noted that they have\noccurred at intervals throughout Miss A.'s experiences, and in close connection\nwith crystal-gazing or automatic writing. The messages thus communicated\ndo not appear to be in themselves either more or less trustworthy than those\nwhich are written or seen in the crystal.\nCase E.\u2014This case, again, I give here as forming a part of Sir J. Barnby's\naccount. For the present we may assume that the scone or figure here\npresented was analogous to a crystal-vision, although seen without a speeulum,\nand under the aspect of reality. I hope to discuss the possible explanations\nof retrocognitive scenes in a future paper, when we come to deal with retro-\ncognitive written messages.\n[Three more cases connected with Salisbury Cathedral may be added here.]\nAug., Sept., 1889, & Feb., 1890. In the presence of myself.\u2014H. M. Radnor.\nG. Retrocognitive Scene.\nThe first time Miss A went to the Cathedral she noticed standing in the\ndoor of the chapel opposite the \"Cage\" (or Hungerford Chapel), a monk,\ndressed in dull sort of muddy brown i with a knotted cord round his waist,\na sort of tippet and hood, and something white, either cloth or flesh (?)\nwhere the hood or tippet was not drawn close. He carried in his hands a\nbrown rosary and silver (?) cross hanging to it.\nSubsequently she saw a good many of them apparently filing out of the\ndoor of the chapel, and back again, holding books and rosaries. The cross\nof the rosary was rather a peculiar shape.\nShe has seen these monks nearly every time she has been to the Cathedral,\nand one gave his name one day by raps, but owing to the fact that the\nBishop and the head verger both said that no order of monks had ever been\nconnected with the Cathedral, we thought that perhaps it was an hallucina\ntion. Yesterday, however, February 23rd, 1890, Miss A again saw the monks,\nand asked what Order they belonged to ; the answers were by raps.\nQ. : What Order do you belong to ? A. : St. Francis d'Assisi. Q. : Do\nyou mean Franciscans 1 A. : Yes. Q. : Did you live here 1 A. : No. Q.\nWhere then ? A. : Palace.\n' In Steven's Continuation of Dugdale'i Monasticon there is a plate of a Franciscan\n.which exactly corresponds with what Miss A saw. We only found this afterwards.\n\f508 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nHaving obtained this clue, on my return home I looked in Britton's History\nof Wiltshire, and found on an uncut page that there had been a Monastery\nof Groyfriars (Franciscans) at the S.E. corner of the Cathedral (where the\nPalace and grounds now are), and that Bishop Poore gave them the land.\nTho present Bishop has just unearthed from the cellars of the Palace a\nbeautiful vaulted crypt room, which was supposed to exist in or previous to\nthe time of Bishop Poore. This is a curious coincidence, and may have been\nwhere the Greyfriars lived. Sir Richard Colt Hoare mentions that there\nexisted an Order of Friars taking their name from St. Francis d'Assisi,\nwho were settled at Salisbury.\nII. Retroeognitive .S'cene. (Brian Duppa.)\nOn February 23rd, 1890, Miss A and I were in the \"Cage\" and\nshe told mo she saw a grand ceremonial taking place. There appeared\nto be a tall chair which obstructed the view down the choir, and\ngradually the place appeared filled with clericals and others dressed in their\nbest attire. Then she saw a tall big man, slowly walking up, dressed in red\nwith white and lace over it, something that hung round his neck and down\nto his feet of broad gold embroidery, and a broad sort of mitre (but not peaked)\nmore like a biretta, of beautiful embroidery.\nThen there were throo or four dressed very much like him, gorgeously\ndressed, and lots of little boys about in red and white and lace\u2014holding\ncandles, books, Ac. The whole place was very full of people, and it was\nevidently a great occasion. After the principal figure had knelt in front of\nthe chair\u2014looking to the west for somo little time\u2014he stood up and ten\nlittle boys lifted up the chair, and carried it higher up and placed\nit in front of tho altar, still facing west. Then the principal figure\nwalked up two steps and faced the east. (The whole of the arrangements\nof the altar, &c., aa Miss A saw them, are quite different from what they are\nnow.) [It is hero meant that Miss A.'s description was correct for that past\ndate ; as Lord Radnor explicitly told me was the case.] He had nothing on\nhis head now. He knelt some little timo, and then the most gorgeously\ndressed of the other figures placed something like a mitre on his head and\nretired, and the principal figure walked up to the chair, and sat down on it\nfacing the congregation. Miss A said she saw him later dead in a coffin,\nwith the Winchester Cross over him. She says he was tall, big, clean\nshaven, a little curling hair, and blue-grey oyes.\nMiss A asked what she was seeing, and the answer came by raps.\nA. : Tho induction of Briant Uppa.\nThen Miss A said : There can't be such a name ; it must be wrong.\nShe tried again, and got\u2014\nA. : You are wrong. It is Duppa, not Uppa. Brian Duppa. Q. : Who\nwas Brian Duppa 1 A. : Cluster. Q. : What was he 1 A. : Bishop here.\nQ. : When 1 or what was his date ? A. : 44-16. His researches would\nhelp you. Manuscripts should lay at Winchester.\nOn returning home, we were talking after tea, and I casually took uri\nBritton's History of Wiltshire, and said to Miss A, laughing : \"Now I will look\nfor your Bishop.\" . . . The pages where the Bishops' names were were\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 509\nuncut, sides and top. I cut them, and to our delight we found on p. 149 :\u2014\n\" Brian Duppa or De Uphaugh, D.D. . . . tutor to Prince Charles\n. . . . translated to the See of Chichester (Cluster ?).... Bishop\nof 1641 .... (deposed soon after by Parliament) .... pre\nferred soon after the Restoration to the See of Winchester.\" He was at Caris-\nbrooke with Charles I., and is supposed to have assisted him in the writing\nof the Eikon Basilikc, which book Miss A had been looking at in my boudoir\na few days previously, but which contains no mention of him nor his name.\nJ. RetrocotpMive. (Rayne Stevens.)\nIn the \"Cage\" the same day that \" Longland \" came, August, 1889,\nthere were loud raps. Miss A asked who it was and got the following :\u2014\n\" Rtyne Ste(v-ph ?)ens. He was the first metz-tenor in 1796. He went to\nCanterbury in 1805. He received a watch from William Bouverie, Lord Folke\nstone's\u2014(?)\u2014because he perilled his limbs to stop his horse in Salisbury.\"\nI have been unable to verify this entirely at present, but I found an\nentry in the old account-books (the first Viscount's) in 1755 :\u2014\n\"Dr. Stephens for teaching Billey the Harpsichord, etc.\"\n\" Billey \" was grandson to the first Viscount. The said \" Billey \" was M.P.\nfor Salisbury, and I find that according to Britton (p. 182), John Stephens,\nMus.Doc, was organist of the Cathedral, and was buried there in 1780.\nHe was possibly the father of Rayne, but that I have not yet made sure of.\nK. Retrocognitive Scene. (White Webs.)\nI was looking in the crystal a year or two ago at Longford Castle. Lady\nRadnor was in the room with me. I saw amongst other things a large\ncarved fireplace with a coat of arms in the middle and curious serpents\nentwined. There seemed to be a secret passage, which opened on touching\none of the serpents' heads. I seemed to follow this path until it led out by\na river, and I saw figures pass along it in old-fashioned dress. The name\nEdwye de Bovery was then spelt out in the crystal ; and Lady Radnor said\nthat the vision must bo .all wrong, as the name had never been spelt like that.\nThe name \" White Webs \" was also spelt out\u2014a name of which I had never\nheard. A few days afterwards, when I was looking at some books in the\nlibrary I saw a curious old book with crests and coats of arms, drawn by\nhand, not printed ; and in this book I found one of the coats of arms which\nI had seen in the crystal ;\u2014only the one in the book was quartered with\nanother, and the one I saw in the crystal was quite by itself. Lady Radnor\nfound that it was the coat belonging to an heiress, a Miss Smith. A little\nwhile afterwards, in an old church register or account-book or something, the\nname of Sir Edwye do Bovery was found. [Tt was in an extract from a\nparish register at Britford Church, in which parish Longford is.\u2014H. M.\nRadnor.]\n[Sir Edward des Bouverie, Kt., whose name I have since found spelt\nin old deeds de Bovery, though he signed it himself des Bouverie, lived\nat the Red House, Cheshunt, Herts, and died there 1694. His son, Sir\nWilliam, sold the house, and lived partly at the Parsonage of Cheshunt.\nThere is a place called White Webs in that neighbourhood. Sir Edward's\ngrandson, Edward des Bouverie, sold the property and settled at Longford in\n2 M\n\f510 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n1717. In 1718 he married Mary Smith, daughter and co-heiress of John\nSmith of London, one of the 'first Governors of the Bank of England.\nThere were many secret passages leading to and from the Red House at\nCheshunt ; but I have not tried to identify the house at White Webs.\u2014H.\nM.

Retrocognitive Scene. (\"Jolly Dick Scrope.\")\nOn June 28th, 1892, Miss A met for the first time the Hon. Percy Wynd-\nham at Lady Radnor's. A scene and then writing appeared in the crystal,\nwhich was repeated to me verbally by Lord Radnor on July 1st, 1892, with\nthe ambiguity between Prince and King below mentioned by Lady Radnor.\nA scene of festivity appeared, with persons in old-fashioned dress ; and then\nthe message (as written by Lady Radnor, July 8th) \"Jolly Dick Scrope with\nhis Prince (or King) bluff Harry, at the wedding of his daughter Nell.''\n\" Then thinking that it might have taken place in Wiltshire [where Scropes\nare neighbours of Wyndhams] we asked ' Where is it taking place ? ' and the\nanswer came, very quickly, KROY (York).\u2014H. M. Radnor.\"\n[In the hope of clearing the matter up, I begged Miss Porter, who is\naccustomed to research in the British Museum, to search for any trace of a\nDick Scrope with a daughter Nell, at whose wedding at York Henry VIII.\nwas likely to have been present. Miss Porter replied (July 6th, 1892) :\n\"Yorkshire and Wiltshire were the haunts of the Scrope family. I spent\nsome time at first with the pedigrees of the Wiltshire branch, but found\nno 'Dick' with daughter 'Nell.'

Del.\nOxford, 4 Aug.\nEleanor Scrope was dead before Henry was king, for in 1509 Thomas\nWyndham obtained a licence to marry his second wife, Elizabeth Darcy.\nAnd from the Testam-cnta Elioracensia (Durham, 1865 : Surtees Society) III.,\n297, exxii., it appears that Richard Scrope's will was proved in 1485, before\nHenry VIII. was born. The sentence, therefore, given in explanation of\nthe picture contains an error. On the other hand it is the case that Henry\nVIII. showed various favours to the Scrope family.\n\"As a Scrope of Bolton it seems probable that Eleanor was married at\nYork. But the registers of marriages in the Minster do not extend so far\nback as Tudor times, and the marriage licences filed at the Diocesan Registry-\ndo not commence till 1661.\"\nFrom these documents it appeared that the conjectured connection\nbetween the Scrope family and Mr. Percy Wyndham depended not merely on\nneighbourhood in Wiltshire, but on the fact that Nell Scrope's husband was\na Wyndham. I wrote to Mr. Wyndham asking as to his connection with\nSir Thomas, and received reply dated Clouds, Salisbury, July 12th, 1892 :\u2014\n\" Sir Thomas was my direct ancestor. There has never been but one family\nof the Wyndhams, and beyond one or two actors and actresses who have\ntaken the name, it has never been usurped.\" [The Windhams&reH different\nfamily altogether.]\nThis case is remarkable because the theory of unconscious memory on the\nseer's own part is practically excluded. On the other hand it is of course\nprobable that Mr. Wyndham had at some time known of the Wyndham-\nScrope marriage, temp. Henry VII., although he had so completely forgotten\nthe fact when the message came. We cannot positively assert that the\n2 m 2\n\f512 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nknowledge may not have passed from Mr. Wyndham's subliminal self to Miss\nA's, and assumed the dramatic form of \"Jolly Dick Scrope,\" &c In the\npedigree of the A family, given in the history of their county, there is\nmention of the marriage of the 5th Baron Scrope (of Bolton) to the widow of\nSir Robert A, a collateral ancestor. But even assuming (as we are bound to\ndo) that this fact, although not consciously remembered by any of the A\nfamily, may have at some time been known to Miss A, this brings us little\nnearer to Dick Scrope, who is not mentioned in the pedigree, and whose\nrelationship to Lord Scrope is only to be seen in the Scrope pedigree. I\nwill add that Miss A has never shown any sort of interest in genealogical or\nantiquarian research.\nThe origin or origins of these retrocognitive scenes can only be gradually\nguessed at by comparing many instances. In order that the reader may at\nonce realise their frequent element of inaccuracy I introduce here a\nmessage given not by the crystal but by automatic script.\nCase of Jack Creasy.\nOn June 27th, 1891, Miss A took pencil in hand. The following notes\nwere made directly after the sitting, and the automatic script is in my\nhands. The handwriting of the soi-disant Jack Creasy is barely legible\nMid of an uneducated type.\nMuch scribbling. At last, very illegibly, and many times, was written\n\"Jack.'\n\"Jack \" who ? Miss A said \" I daresay ' Jack the Ripper,' or some one of\nthat kind.\"\n\" Jock Creasg.\"\n'What do you want ? \"Help pore Marg.\"\nWhere did you live ? (Very illegible) \" Fillers \" (or) \" Tillers Buildings.\"\nWhere? \" Greenwich.\"\nAre you in the flesh ? \" No\u2014flesh all burnt.\" Then a rude drawing nor\nrecognisable.\nWere you burnt ? \" Yes\u2014piche kitl.\"\nIn Fillers' Buildings ? \" In Blackwall Road.\"\nWhen ? \" Long\u2014perhaps twenty month.\"\nWas it an accident ?

Mr. G. A. Smith reports as follows :\u2014\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 513\nJuly 22nd, 1891.\n\" The reports of the accident appeared in the Kentish Mercury, The South\nEastern Herald, Greenwich and Deptford Observer for July 12th, and accounts\nof the inquest appeared in the same papers for August 2nd, 1889. Other\npapers would probably contain accounts, but it would be almost impossible\nto discover them, I think ; the above-named are local papers. These accounts\n.are all practically alike, and there is much detail of the accident and subse\nquent official inquiry ; but there is no mention in any of them of ' Pore\nMary,' ' Fullers (!) Buildings,' or 'Bob Heal.' Creasy's address is given\nas 28, Lethbridge-road, Lewisham.\"\nJuly 23rd.\n\" I went to the tar-distilling works of Messrs. Forbes, Abbot and Lennard\nto-day at Ordnance Wharf, Greenwich Marshes, and saw Mr. Lennard, who\ntook a good deal of interest in the matter. He said Creasy had a wife who\nis still living, he thinks, at 28, Lethbridge-road, and he (Lennard) had met her\nand corresponded in arranging to get her boy into an orphan's asylum. He\ndid not know whether her name was Mary or not. He could throw no light\non Fullers (!) Buildings, nor could the workmen amongst whom he caused the\ninquiry to be circulated ; nor can I after searching the directory and asking\nthe police.\n\" The works are bounded on one side by Blackwall Lane.\n\"The statement about Mr. Lennard putting Creasy to ' shift the mixter '\nis altogether wrong. Mr. Lennard did not put him to the job\u2014it was a part\nof Creasy's routine, and there was nothing to shift. No man of the name\nof Bob Heal was ever on the works. There was no question of anyone\n'putting the light,' though the explosion was certainly caused by Creasy\nbreaking the rule by having an uncovered safety lamp. There is no such\nthing as a pitch vat, so it could not get 'cort.' The accident was an\nexplosion caused by an escape of vapour from defective pipes becoming\nignited by a naked flame in the vicinity, viz., Creasy's uncovered Davey\n\u2022lamp.\" G. A. Smith.\n[The description of the accident in the Kentish Mercury says that \" The\nnight watchman told Creasy to get a little fire off the still, there being too\nmuch heat. Twenty minutes after there was a report ; the place was in\nflames, and the deceased was found fifteen or twenty yards from the still.\"\nThe verdict of the Coroner's inquest (before Mr. E. A. Carttar) gives as\ncause of death : \" Burns from ignition of vapour from a tar still through\ndefective condition of plant.\"\nA pitch kettle is not a tar still ;\u2014though perhaps it comes as near to it as\nPiche Kitl comes to pitch kettle. And someone certainly \"put the light\"\nwhere it caught the vapour, only that someone was not the mythical Bob\nHeal, but Creasy himself.\nOne other point is worth notice. Long names of firms are generally\nabbreviated in common speech ; but there seems nothing in the reports, so\nfar as we have seen them, to indicate that the middle name was thus used in\nthis case. I asked Mr. G. A. Smith what name was most used on the spot,\nand he replies : \"In finding out the works, those who directed me generally\n.spoke of ' Forbes and Abbot's ' works, and the wharf attached to the place\n\f514 Mr. F. W. H. Myera.\nseemed Iietter known as Abbot's Wharf than hy its proper title, Ordnance\nWharf. On the whole 1 should say that the works are commonly known as\nAbbot's.\"\nM. Retrocoynitice Scene.\nMrs. A gives the following account : \"In October, 1886, my daughter\nsaw in the stone in her bracelet a scene which considerably impressed me,\nas it was one which I at once identified, while I was absolutely sure that I\nhad never mentioned it to her or to any of my children. She saw a man in\na barge-like boat with a very large gun fixed in it, the object of which she\ncould not understand. The man was alone and lying in the bottom of the\nboat, and this also puzzled her. Waves seemed to get up, and the man\nrowed extremely hard, as though trying to get to shore. Then she saw\nhim throw himself down motionless on to the low beach, as if dead. Now\nthis plainly refers to a sad crisis in my father's life. He went out duck-\nshooting alone on a Norfolk Broad, with an opening to the sea. A storm\ngot up and he was all but blown out to sea. He was a very strong man,\nand by great exertion he got to land. Then ho threw himself down\nabsolutely spent ; and the exhaustion of that day was the beginning of\nan illness which ultimately killed him.\"\nN. Retrocognitive Vision. (Strafford.)\nLady Radnor writes, February 23rd, 1890, from Longford Castle,\nSalisbury : \" [Miss A] has been with me now for three weeks ; but the fact\nis she sees and hears so many things that we really can't keep pace with\nthem all in the matter of chronicling. The most interesting thing we have\nhad, I think, is that she has several times seen in the crystal and at\n\" sittings \" a figure purporting to be Lord Strafford (the one executed by\nCharles I.), who declares that a paper signed by Henrietta Maria about\nhimself is hidden in this house. He keeps on saying, ' Find the Queen's\nseal. ' Oddly enough, since this occurred I have found a scrap of paper in\nthe late Lady Radnor's handwriting, mentioning the things in Queen\nElizabeth's cabinet, and amongst others there is a deed or document signed\nby Henrietta Maria and the great officers of her household, including the\nKeeper of the Queen's Great Seal. This paper is nowhere to be found now,\nthough the other articles are all there as named in the list. The figure says\nthe paper had to do with his (Strafford's) release.\"\nIn reply to my questions Lady Radnor further writes, February 25th :\n\" By no possibility could [she] have seen the list I refer to [of objects in the\ncabinet]. It was locked up among a lot of old papers that I knew nothing\nof ; and as I had forgotten the fact myself I could not have mentioned it. \"\n[Another case, which in one sense at least is retrocognitive, is supplied,\nby the Hon. Eric Barrington, and confirmed by Mrs. Barrington. I have also\nreceived a concordant account of the crystal-message from Lady Radnor,\nthe hostess on the occasion alluded to.]\n0. 62, Cadogan-place.\nNovember 21st, 1892.\nTwo years ago I mot Miss A, I think for the first time, at dinner at a\nfriend's house. She told my wife that she had seen standing behind my\nchair a figure which from her description, though somewhat vague, seemed\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 515\nto be that of a very great friend of mine, an officer who had died about\nseven years ago on active service. She referred particularly to the attitude\nassumed by the figure, which was like the one in a photograph I possess of\nhim, but which she had never seen. She knew nothing of this friendship, and\nthe name of the officer was not mentioned to her.\nLast summer we met again at the same house, and although in the in\nterval we had become better acquainted with Miss A and her family, I am\nnot conscious of having ever said anything to her on the subject of my\nfriend. On reaching the drawing-room after dinner I found her looking\ninto a crystal and dictating with extraordinary rapidity a number of letters\nof the alphabet which were passing before her, and were being taken down\nby the lady of the house, who had the greatest difficulty in keeping pace\nwith her. When the letters ceased, it was discovered by marking them off from\nthe end that they formed a complete message, of which each word was spelt\nbackwards. Before the letters began to show themselves Miss A saw in the\ncrystal the same figure that she had seen two years before, dressed in what\nappeared to be a dark uniform, and in the same peculiar attitude, but I was\nnot in the room when this occurred. As soon, however, as the message was\ndeciphered by our hostess, it became evident that it purported to proceed\nfrom the person whose likeness had just been reproduced. It was addressed,\nnot to me, who was absent from the room when the letters first appeared,\nbut to my wife, and was to the following effect :\u2014\n\" Ask your husband whether he still remembers T. T. Tell him that I\nam constantly with him, and that death makes no difference in friendship.\"\nThe full surname was given, preceded by a nickname which had been\ndropped when he grew up, and was only known to those who, like myself,\nhad been intimate with him from childhood.\nIt cannot be suggested that Miss A had been in any way impressed by\nmy thoughts, for it was not until I sat by my hostess and helped her to spell\nout the words of the message that I realised from whom it came, when I was\nable to explain the meaning of the nickname that had completely puzzled\nher, though she had been well acquainted with the bearer after he entered\nthe army. Ekic Barrinuton.\nThis entirely agrees with my recollection of the circumstances. The\nmoment Miss A described the figure on our first meeting, I felt a very\npeculiar sensation, accompanied by a certainty as to the identity of the\nperson she saw. \u2022 Christina Barrinuton.\n[There is a privately printed life of the officer in question, in which an\nearly nickname of his is given. But I find that this nickname is not the\nsame as that shown in the crystal, which was appropriate for recognition\nby friends of boyhood only.]\nThe possible sources of retrocognitive messages will be discussed,\nI hope, more fully in a subsequent paper. At present I will only\nobserve that, assuming the probity of the seer, which does not in this\ncase need my testimonial, the danger is of unconscious memory of some\nbook or conversation read or heard unheedingly, and perhaps long ago.\nIn a case discussed in the S.P.R. Journal for July, 1891, I considered\nthat explanation of the messages probable. Here, in my judgment, it\n\f516 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nis improbable in tbe extreme. But, apart from the discussion of such\nchances, the evidential value of retrocognitive scenes is of course greatly\nstrengthened if (as in the present case) the same percipient has seen\ncontemporary scenes also, and has had veridical visions or messages which\ncould not by their very nature have been derived in a normal manner\nfrom any existing source.\nCase IV.\u2014Mr. Keulemans.\nXVII.\u2014My next witness, Mr. Keulemans, has been known to me,\npersonally and by correspondence, for ten years. He has contributed\nseveral cases, mentioned below, to our Proceedings. Mr. Keulemans, as\nthe world of naturalists well knows, is a scientific draughtsman,\nespecially strong in Ornithology. His works may be seen in the\nProceedings of the Zoological Society, in the Catalogue of the British\nMuseum, in the Ibis (Journal of the Ornithologist's Union), Ac, ifcc.\nHe has illustrated many monographs, and some large treatises. See\narticle \" Ornithology,\" in Encyclopedia Britannica, pp. 13, 16, 17.\nM. 53.\n\" Health.\u2014My health is excellent, and has always been so. I was once ill\nwith yellow fever when in Sierra Leone ; but owing to my robust constitution\nI recovered, whilst about forty per cent, of the other victims died. I have\nalso had rheumatic fever. But as a rule I never suffer from any derange\nment whatsoever. Perfect digestion, good sound sleep, and a happy home-\nlife are my special blessings. But perhaps the French .fa cants may suggest\nthat though my physique is normal, my nerves or brain may be wrong. I\ndo not think there is anything abnormal in any of my functions or faculties.\nI have a very strong memory for names, &c. , but no great power of mental\ncalculation. I have a rare ear and memory for music I know about twenty\noperas by heart, and could reproduce the most striking parts of about fifty\nmore. I have a strong feeling for ' harmony ' of all kinds\u2014in sound,\nmovement, colour, and form. I take a great interest in Nature, and am\nperpetually miking observations and experiments, and have, besides,\nproduced over 20,000 original drawings of birds and animals. All this sounds\nvery much like ' brag,' but as you ask me the questions I cannot but state\nall particulars that may have a bearing on the point.\n\" Visualisation.\u2014[Mr. Keulemans' power of visualisation is, as his artistic\nwork indicates, very strong.] I am not subject to illusions hijpnayMjiqnes,\nbut have often very vivid dreams of towns and other beautiful scenery. I\nrarely dream of anything horrible ; perhaps because I do not sup or dine\nlate.\n\"Mode of Sensory Automatism.\u2014I can sometimes become aware of certain\nevents that are taking place, or have already taken place, at a distance, by\nmeans of what is usually called 'clairvoyance.' But my clairvoyance is\npassive ; it is not the active clairvoyance, as I may call it, which enables\nsome people to start in search of events occurring elsewhere\u2014by crystal-\ng tzing, &c. In my cases there was actually something happening elsewhere\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 517\n.which came to me; and if I became aware of it this was owing to my having,\nat first unconsciously, placed myself in a pseudo-hypnotic state.\n\"My profession is that of a scientific artist. I draw a good deal on stone ;\nand my principal subjects are birds and animals. It so happens that the eye\nof a bird, during the slow process of drawing it, forms a capital point for\nconcentration of the mind and consequent distraction from ordinary flows\nof thought. I noticed that whenever strong impressions had got hold of my\nmind they had a tendency to develop themselves into a vivid mind-picture\nas soon as my eye and attention were concentrated upon the eye in the\ndrawing ; and that whenever I began darkening the iris, leaving the light\nspeck the most prominent part, I would slowly pass off into a kind of\ndream-state. The mere act of drawing the eye is not enough to bring me\ninto this state, or I should experience such a state at least once a day, which\nI do not. But if a strong mental impression takes hold of me I begin\ndrawing an eye, since I know from experience that such an impression\nmeans that something has occurred which, so to say, comes within reach of\nmy centre of mental attraction. The drawing will then convey to me the\nnews, either in the form of a vague, imperfect representation of the person\nindicated in the impression, or by a correct hallucinatory picture of the\nevent as it actually occurred, both as regards the person and the sur\nroundings. Sometimes I cannot get at the vision at once ; other thoughts\nand scenes interfere. But when I begin to feel drowsy I know I shall have\nit right in a second ; and here I lose normal consciousness. That there is\nan actual loss of consciousness I know from the fact that on one occasion\nmy wife had been in the room talking to me, and not receiving a reply\nthought that something was wrong with me and shook my shoulder. The\nshake brought me back to my waking state.\n' Telepathic Instance.\u2014A. Last summer, in Paris, I experienced a picture\nof the vaguer class. I first had a strong notion that something was wrong\nsomewhere, affecting a near relative. As the notion kept disturbing me,\nI resorted to my bird's-eye experiment, and saw my wife and mother-in-\nlaw moving hurriedly in my bedroom here at Southend. I then heard my\nchild, little Marie, scream ; not a painful outcry, rather an outburst of\ntemper. This happened at about 1 p.m. I wrote home asking for par\nticulars and posted the letter at 4 p.m. At 9 p.m. I was with a friend\nat Montreuil, near Paris. The family were finishing their dinner, and I\nwalked into the garden, when I saw hallucinatorily, without any experi\nmental means, a picture of our bedroom, and little Marie in sound sleep.\nI heard my boys laugh. It was all right again at home, said the telepathic\n' message. ' Two days later my wife wrote that I had been correct in my\nperception of little Marie's condition. She had been very ill during the\nday\u2014a kind of fit caused by the presence of thread-worms ; but by nine\no'clock, after vigorous treatment, was better, and went to sleep. Here the\nmessage was correct so far as the person was concerned ; but there was a\nHaw in the visualisation of the surroundings, since Marie had not been in\nour bedroom, but in the nursery.\n\" Clairvoyant Instances.\u2014li. Some three years ago I experienced what I\nbelieve to have been a correct representation of actual facts. I saw in my\nmind's eye one of my aunts walking in a room, with her right side bent, as\n\f518 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nthough in pain. I saw the room, even to the pattern of the wall-paper.\nBy my 'bird's-eye ' experiment I toeid into the room, and saw it just as I\nhad visualised it a few moments before, but more distinctly. The sensation\nwas akin to a dream, not of the most vivid kind. But I woke up from it ;\nI found, that is to say, that I had actually lost normal consciousness.\n\"I wrote to my father, not asking whether my Aunt Marie was ill, but\nsimply stating that she was so, as though I had heard it as a piece of news.\nIn fact, I had not seen this aunt, nor heard from her, for over twenty years.\nMy parents had not seen her for several years. But she died a few days\nafter my father received my letter. She lived in a little village in Brabandt,\nand I have never seen her house ; but one of my sisters knew a room in her\nhouse very like that which I described. My father has not preserved my\nletter. He laughs at clairvoyance, and finds it funny that I should practice\n' conjuring.'\n\" C. About five years ago I had a similar experience. I was drawing an\nanimal on stone, and when I came to the eye I saw my grandmother sitting\nin her room, knitting stockings. The same visualisation returned whenever\nmy chalk passed over that same part of my drawing, until at last I ' went\noff,' and was in the room. I noticed clairvoyantly the pattern of the\nAmerican cloth covering the table. I had been in the room in person some\nyears previous. Two days later my brother wrote that our grandmother\nwas very ill, and not likely to recover. About a week after this\u2014again when\ndrawing the eye of an animal or bird\u2014the sound of an aria from the opera\n'La Dame Blanche' strongly affected my mental ear. I heard it just as\nthough it was actually being played upon a musical-box just outside my\nroom. I then remembered that my grandmother had a clock playing that\ntune. I heard the tune at about 7 p.m., and my grandmother died some\nrive hours later on the same day.\"\nIt may be remembered that Mr. Keulemans has already contributed five\ncoincidental experiences to Phnntasms of the Living.i In referring to one\nof these cases (Proceedings, XIV., p. 51<j, note) Miss X remarked that \"Mr.\nKeulemans seemed able to get definite pictures transferred from the uncon\nscious region of the mind without needing a crystal to aid in their fixation.\"\nThis set Mr. Keulemans upon more careful observation, and he says: \"I\nhave since discovered that all my cases of seeing happened while I was doing\nsome kind of work like the gradual ' graining-in ' of part of a drawing. \"\nHe adds another case which, although very remote, stands out so\ndefinitely in Mr. Keulemans' memory that it may be briefly given here.\n1). Mr. Keulemans, when a boy, was to be taken by his uncle on a fishing\nexpedition. There was a mistake about hours, and the boy, running hurriedly\nto the boat, found that he was there before the rest of the party. He sat\ndown to rest, witli head on hands, and full into a dream or state of changed\nconsciousness. In this state he saw a man unknown to him trying to strike\na fowl with a walking-stick in a known country-lane, completely out of sight\nand hearing. \"I heard him laugh, and noticed how a lock of his long, fair hair\ni Cases numbered 21, 38, 50, 184 : and see case in note Vol. I., p. 250.\nSee also Vol. I., p. 441 note, and Vol. II., pp. 33, 31, for cases somewhat similar to\nMr. Keulemans' experiences.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 519\nfell over his face, and how he tried to remove it by throwing back his head.\"\nThis man was in fact one of the uncle's fishing party, and had acted just\nas described a few minutes before. He charged the boy with having\nfollowed and watched him, and run round some other way. But the boy's\npulse was found tranquil, and the boatman testified to his having rested\nthere for some time.\nWe have, therefore, nine cases, more or less well-evidenced, and all of\nsomewhat similar type, which Mr. Keulemans regards as certainly coinci\ndental.\nMr. Keulemans adds, however, that between 12 and 17 he had almost\ndaily cases of \" ecstasy,\" which ho believes to have often contained true\nclairvoyance but which he kept to himself and rarely endeavoured to test.\nHe still has these ecstasies occasionally ; and some of his non-coincidental\ncases should be read in order that his faculty should be estimated from data\nas full as possible. I abbreviate from a letter of January 11th, 1891 :\u2014\n\" Last year, when sitting outside a London omnibus, I noticed what I\nthought to be a ' darting spider ' sitting on a dark board. I closely watched\nit, expecting to see it make a sudden dart, when, strange to say, both\nspider and board vanished\u2014and \/ was in Paris. There was the Hue do\nLafayette\u2014I passed the Opera\u2014down the Rue du 4 Septembrc, when a real\nperson asked me a question which I had just sense enough to understand to\nbe in English, and I found myself, to my great surprise, at the Mansion\nHouse.\"\n\"Last winter I had been ill of rheumatic fever, and, although at work\nbefore my easel, still felt pain all over. My mind was clear, but with an\ninclination to get into the comatose condition in which real clairvoyance has\noften manifested itself. So I gave in, like an hypnotised subject, and pur\nposely forced my eyes upon some particular spot in my picture, trying\ndifferent colours alternately. Med gave me a headache, and I had to avert\nthe influence. Very dark spots had no effect whatsoever. Then the coma\ntose sensation went off until I was again at work at some particular spot\nrequiring but mechanical labour. Blue-grey and light yellow seemed the\nmost likely to send me off. I was looking intently at a blue-green line\nbounding a grey one, when gradually I found picture and surroundings go in a\nmist, which cleared up, and I was now looking at some two or three children\nclimbing over a gate. They were very indistinct, but the landscape on their\nright now became very clear and beautiful. It represented a lovely farmyard\nscene, which I recognised as a place known to me between Southchurch\nand Wakering, in Essex. I was there, as really as I am now writing at my\ndesk\u2014nay, more really than in the normal state, for all my pain was gone in\nthe genial temperature and under the beautiful summer sky. I felt per\nfectly happy, healthy, and more than usually vigorous. Also I seemed\nconscious of possessing a far greater knowledge of things in general than in\nnormal life. But there was here no actual clairvoyance. I saw a familiar\nlandscape in it\u00ab summer aspect, whereas, had I been transcendentally present\nthere, I should have witnessed a winter scene with falling snow, for it was on\na dirty January day that I saw the vision. I have always thought that there\nmay be some affinity between the conditions in which non-veridical and those\nin which veridical or clairvoyant impressions are experienced.\"\n\f520 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nIt is noticeable that in this case the hallucinatory sensation pervaded the\npercipient's whole being, giving a sense of extraordinary bien-etre and of\nunwonted insight into reality. A similar case is cited by Professor James\n(Principles of Psychology, Vol. II., p. 120), where the informant had a single\nexperience of the same ecstatic and exhilarating kind. \" I had only just sat\ndown and become interested in the circular when I seemed to lose myself for a\nminute and then found myself in the top storey of a high building, very white\nand shining and clean, with a noble window, through which I looked out upon a\nmarvellous reach of landscape entirely new. I never had before such a sense of\ninfinity in nature, such superb stretches of light and colour and cleanness.\nWhen I began to come to, so to speak, sitting in that other world, I debated\nfor three or four minutes more as to which was dream and which was reality.\nSitting there I got a faint sense of C. [the town in which the writer was]\naway off and dim at first. Then I remembered thinking, ' Why, I used to live\nin C, perhaps I am going back.' Slowly C. did come back, and I felt myself\nat my desk again. The whole experience was perfectly delightful\u2014there\nwas such a sense of brilliancy and clearness and lightness about it.\"\nCases like these (of which I have heard some others) should not, I think,\nba confounded with ordinary dreams ; nor with cases where a series of day\ndreams, at first voluntary, gradually becomes involuntary1 ; still less with the\nvague, uncomfortable sensations of \" being somewhere else \" which form a\nfrequent element in epileptic aure. They are more akin to the sensory\nautomatisms discussed in this paper, and it will be remembered that Miss A\nhas often the feeling that she is in the scene which she sees. But the change\nin subjective sensation recalls rather the experiences of Dr. Wiltse and M.\nBertrand - at the moment when they were apparently dead. The fittest name\nfor all such experiences is ecstasy, for they involve a \" standing forth \" from\nthe habitual environment \u2014the environment of corporeal sensations as well as\nof material surroundings ; and they carry with them \" that thoughtless sense\nof joy bewildering \" which, as I have elsewhere noted, seems the frequent, the\nunexpected accompaniment of these profound shocks to waking personality.\nIt is obvious that in these modern and, so to say, secular cases of ecstasy we\nneed not expect to find the special theological colouring familiar in the\necstasy, for instance, of S. Theresa.\nA curious illustration of the connection between these ecstasies and\ntelepathy is afforded by a recent experience of Mr. Keulemans' at or about\nthe moment of his father's death. His father died at Rotterdam, 3.30 p.m.\nRotterdam time, 3.12 p.m. English time, on August 29th, 1892. This event\nwas preceded for Mr. Keulemans by several externalised auditions (of the\n\" Demon of Socrates \" type) and by a symbolical vision ; to him significant,\nthough hardly definite enough for citation as evidence. On August 29th he\nwas aware of his father's dangerous illness, and expecting to return to\nRotterdam in a few days ; but an immediate end was not looked for. \" On\nMonday, August 29th, at 3.10 p.m. by my watch, whilst I was in the garden\nholding a little trowel in my hand, there suddenly came over me a strange\nfeeling, like a call from the unseen to be attentive, to be prepared for some\ni See Fert', Pathologic ties Emotions, p. 347.\n- Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 180, sqq.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 521\nstrange occurrence. I stood upright in answer to the call, and stood looking\nupon a lane of summer beans. They looked heavenly beautiful ; my garden\nseemed all glorified. I felt my father's influence. If I had held both his\nhands and looked him in the eyes I could not have felt his influence more\nstrongly than I did at that moment. But there was no vision of him. This\nlasted perhaps six seconds. Then it seemed that the garden had resumed\nits normal aspect, and I felt the influence gone ; and with it all the sad\ngloomy thoughts about my father which had occupied my mind. 'This\nmeans that father is gone,' I said to myself. I therefore noted the time\n(3.10 p.m.), wont indoors, and told my wife what had happened to me. I\nthought of telegraphing to my brother in Holland, but changed my mind, as\nit might have seemed to my relatives that I treated my father's death as a\nsubject for experiment.\n\"Next day I heard from my brother that my father had died peacefully at\nhalf-past three on Monday afternoon.\"\nMrs. Keulemans confirms as follows: \"The above, as far as the main\npoints are concerned, is quite correct ; but I have no recollection of my\nhusband describing the garden scene as appearing more beautiful to him\nthan at other times.\"\u2014A. Keulemans.\nHere again we have the points so often noticed,\u2014the entire removal of\nsorrow from the moment when the departed friend has got his hold, so to\nsay, on the survivor's mind ;\u2014the association of joy and ecstasy with these\ndeep upheavals of personality, and with the upheaval which we call death.\nI must not here pursue this topic. But one further remark may be made\nas to Mr. Keulemans' habit of mind, or type of intelligence, with reference\nto the view which would make of such experiences as his an indication of\n\" mental disintegration,\" an approach to hysterical incoherence or lack of\nwell-controlled personality. My contention is that although a weak person\nality may be subject to such disintegrations against its will, it is character\nistic also of a strong personality to be capable of using concealed resources ;\nor say, altering its focus of crystallisation with more readiness than is possible\nto an ordinary man. I have claimed this in the case of various forms of genius,\nand I note that Mr. Keulemans' vigorous and eager versatility is accom\npanied by a marked power over memory and capacity for forming and separat\ning mnemonic chains. Thus he has a stronger tendency than most men to\nform a continuous dream-memory, going on from one night to another. And,\nleading a busy life divided between Paris and London, he has a tendency to\nform two memories for these two lives, and to forget when in Palis the\nincidents of his London life. This tendency to a certain extent exists in all\nof us ; but in Mr. Keulemans it would, if not controlled, lead far towards a\nduplication of consciousness. He can, however, by voluntary effort, control it\ncompletely. There is, therefore, no reason to regard it as disadvantageous ;\nrather, it effects automatically that act of putting away from the mind need\nless encumbrances which is one of the first needs of the busy man. In my\nview, therefore, Mr. K.'s intellectual history illustrates the interest and\nknowledge added to a healthy and capable man by a slightly increased power\nof sitting loosely to the bonds of supraliminal personality\u2014of altering the\nfocus of mental crystallisation to suit a change in environment.\nThe cases which I have thus far cited have come, with hardly an\n\f522 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nexception, from the limited circle of persons already independently\nknown to me, and the experiments recorded have for the most part\nbeen undertaken at my request.\nXVIII.\u2014I will add a few detached cases of crystal-vision for which\nthe authority seems good. In the first case the seer, now married to an\nEnglishman, is known to me, and the witnesses, Colonel Wiekham and\nhis wife, Princess di Cristoforo, (whose acquaintance I made in conse\nquence of their publication of the following incidents in Light), have\nassured me that the following incidents, although now the only ones\nwhich can be clearly remembered, were paralleled by several others\nduring the time of Ruth's possession of the power which seems now to\nhave left her. She has never been in any way a professional clair\nvoyant, and is, so far as I can judge, a trustworthy person. The value\nof the following case, however, does not depend upon her trustworthi\nness, but on the recollection retained by Colonel AVickham and his wife\nof incidents, which, even if we suppose errors of memory as to details,\nwere of a very definite type.\nM. 54.\nEarly in the spring of the year 1885, I was living at Colaba with my\nhusband, a major of the Royal Artillery. Colaba is the Royal Artillery\nstation, and is situated about two miles from Bombay. For some little time\nI had been studying Gregory's minima! Magnetism. The subject possessing\na peculiar fascination for me, I had experimented occasionally, with varying\nsuccess, on the different servants (Indian for the most part) of my establish\nment. Over one girl, a half-caste, my children's nurse, I possessed great\ninfluence, and used frequently to magnetise a tumbler of water, so that by\nmaking her look therein I might learn what my friends at a distance were\ndoing.\nThis girl was no ignorant native, but a well-educated young woman, able\nto read and write, who spoke English nearly as well as I do myself, having\nbeen educated in the Protestant training school at Belgaum. Many things\nwhich this girl told me I have since discovered to have actually occurred :\nothers I have never yet been able to verify.\nOne day, the morning Lord Reay was expected to arrive in Bombay, the\nRoyal Artillery (of which my husband was then in command) was, together\nwith the other European troops quartered at Colaba, ordered to line the\napproach to the landing-place at the Apollo Bunder, all officers having to\nappear in full regimentals. Wo were still sitting at breakfast when my\nhusband called to his orderly to get out his uniform and place it ready for\nhim to put on. The man soon returned, and, with a bewildered air,\nstammered, as he salaamed before his master : \" Sahib, me no can find the\ndress pouch-belt.\"\n\"Don't talk nonsense, you must be blind as a bat,\" ejaculated the Major,\nas, rising impatiently from his seat, he walked into his dressing-room. Soon,\nhis voice, raised in angry exclamation, burst on my ears. From what I heard\nI gathered that the dress pouch-belt was really not to be found, and further\nthat my enraged husband was accusing each and all of his servants of having\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 523\nappropriated it. Piteous cries of \"Not me, sahib, me very good man, me\nnot tief,\" filled the air. The jabbering, yelling, and hooting was perfectly\ndeafening. My husband returned to the breakfast-room. \"Now then,\" he\nsaid, \"here is a brilliant opportunity of testing the verity of Ruth's clair\nvoyance. Get her up here and ask her to find my pouch-belt.\" I called\nRuth, who appeared pale and trembling, half imagining we suspected her of\nthe theft.\nWhen I explained to her what I required of her she at first begged to be\nexcused, declaring that her fellow servants would never forgive her should\nthe thief be discovered through her instrumentality. I quieted her fears by\npromising her that should she see the face of the thief in the tumbler she\nneed only reveal the fact to me ; that I would not tell the Sahib, but would\nspeak to the pilferer of the bait myself, and on his restoring the missing\narticle would condone the theft, not letting my husband know who had\npurloined the belt.\nFilling a tumbler with water, I placed my left hand under it, and made\npasses with my right over it. I then bade Ruth taste it. \"It is bitter\nenough, I think,\" she said. \"If Mem Sahib pleases to mesmerise me, I\nthink I can see now.\" Perhaps it may be as well to mention here that Ruth\nalways declared the mesmerised water acquired a bitter flavour after being\noperated on. I have frequently mesmerised one tumbler of water tmd\nplaced another, similar in appearance in every respect, beside it. I have\nthen called Ruth and asked her which was the mesmerised and which the\nuntouched water ; she would taste both and each time invariably detected\nthe difference. Strange to say, also, when I at one time purchased a\npowerful magnet (thinking that perhaps it would prove a more powerful\nmagnetiser than my own hand), Ruth declined to look into the water so\nmagnetised, declaring that she saw flames in it, and that they leapt up as if\nthey wanted to scorch her face ! It was of no use my trying to deceive\nher\u2014she invariably knew which was the \"condemned tumbler \" (as she\ncalled it).\nHaving made this lengthy, though somewhat necessary digression, I will\nnow proceed with my story. We left Ruth just ready to look in the tumbler.\nShe bent her head over it, and a silence of a few seconds' duration ensued.\n\"Can you see anything, Ruth?\" at last I said. \"No! Mem Sahib\u2014\nnothing.\" \" Look for the thief,\" I commanded firmly, making fresh passes\nover her head and the back of her neck, but all to no purpose. Ruth per\nsisted that she saw nothing. I began to think that she was an impostor\nand had humbugged me systematically throughout.\nSuddenly an idea struck me. We would try another way. \"Ruth,\" I\nsaid, \"look for Sahib the day he last wore the dress pouch-belt.\" Silence\nagain. Then, \" I see Sahib,\" said the girl dreamily. \"He is dressing, he\nputs on his uniform, now the pouch-belt. Ah ! he has left the room.\"\n.\"Follow him,\" I said firmly. \"Sahib is getting on his horse : he is riding\naway.\" \"Don't leave him a moment,\" I cried. \"Ah ! but he goes so fast.\nI am tired,\" gasped the girl breathlessly. \"Goon,\" I said. \"Sahib is\nwith other Sahibs, and there are many soldiers and people. It is a grand\nTomasha ; some great person is going away. They all stand near the water.\"\n\"Then rest,\" I, said \" hut don't take your eyes off Sahib.\" She was silent\n\f524 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfor a brief space, then said, \" Sahib has gone into a big house by the water.\nHe goes into a dressing-room. He changes his clothes, all his regimentals,\nare put in his tin c:tse, but the pouch-belt is left out. It is hanging on a\npeg in the dressing-room of the house by the sea.\"\n\"The Yacht Club!\" cried my husband. \"Patilla\" (to his orderly),\n\" send someone at once and see if the belt has been left there.\"\nPatilla salaamed and retired, followed by the rest of the servants.\n\" I wonder,\" mused my husband, \" if I really left it at the Yacht Club\nafter all ? The last day I wore it was when Lord Ripon left for England.\"\n\"We shall soon learn,\" said I, triumphantly. I, for one, had no doubt\nwhatever that the belt would be found there.\nIn as short a time as was compatible with the distance to be traversed\nthe messenger returned. The rush of many feet and the jabbering of many\nvoices convinced me before we saw him that his quest had been a successful\none.\nHe ran panting up the stairs, the belt held high above his head. He\nhad found it as Ruth had seen it\u2014in the house by the sea, hanging on a peg\nin a dressing-room of the Yacht Club.\nRuth could have had no idea where the belt was left. She had been with\nme a very short time, and entered my service long after Lord Ripon's depar\nture from Bombay.\nIn the spring of the same year I was much interested in a polo tourna\nment about to be held at Meerut.\nA then great friend of mine was to take part in this, and as he was\naddicted to falling off occasionally, though in reality a splendid rider and\nplayer, I was feeling rather anxious on his account. I again called Ruth to\nmy assistance. We shut ourselves up in my room and I mesmerised the\nwater as before, Ruth, however, requesting me to place a piece of brown\npaper under the tumbler of water, declaring she could see more plaiuly\nwhen that was beneath it.\nShe placed her hands round the glass to exclude the light.\n\" Go to Meerut,\" I said, steadily.\nAfter impatiently waiting for about ten minutes, Ruth said. \"I am there.''\n\" Find Sahib \" I said, mentioning the name of my friend.\n\" I see a tall, dark man, dressed in blue and white ; he has a slight black\nmoustache, and is thin, with large, fierce eyes.\"\n\" Follow him and tell me how he gets on.\"\n\" He gets on all right ; but the other side is winning. Ah ! \" she cried\nout, piteously, \"a gentleman has been bitten by a horse in the leg. He is.\nin great pain.\"\n\" Not my friend ?\" I inquired anxiously.\n\" No ! not Mem Sahib's friend ; this is a fair gentleman, red faced, with\nvery light hair.\"\n\"Ask his name,\" I said, fixing my eyes intently on her, and exerting my\nwill-power to its uttermost.\n\" I can't ; how can I ? \" she said, doubtfully.\n\"Do as I bid you,\" I replied firmly.\n\" I will ask his syce,\" she said, \"if you can make me visible to him.\"\nI tried with all my might. All to no use !\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 525\n\" Stop ! I hear his name, it is Captain .\"\nI almost jumped out of my chair with delight. My friend, I thought,\nshe might have recognised from his photograph ; but this other man she had\nnever seen, never heard me mention. Indeed, I had never even thought of\nhim since I left the up-country station in which my husband's battery and\nhis regiment had previously been quartered.\nI don't remember now which side it was that eventually won the\ntournament, fully five years having elapsed since that time ; but this I do\nremember, however. When my husband returned in the evening, I asked\nhim if he had any news of the polo tournament. \" No,\" he said, \" we shall\nnot hear until to-morrow.\"\n\"I can give you some news, though,\" I said. \"Ruth asserts that\nCaptain , of the 17th Lancers, has been bitten in the leg. is all\nright, though, but from what Ruth saw I fancy our friends were losing.\"\nMy husband laughed. \"We shall see to-morrow if Ruth is again right,\" he\nsaid.\nHe told the officers of the Royal Artillery mess of my last \"tumbler-\ntelegram,\" as they called them, and I believe much merriment was excited\nat my gullibility. Let those laugh who win, though. The telegrams the\nnext day proved Ruth's story to be perfectly correct in every particular.\nSoon after this a friend of my husband's came to see us. This gentleman\nwas the cantonment magistrate at Assigurgh. My husband was telling him\nabout Ruth and her strange powers, when he asked me if I had any\nobjection to his testing them, to the end that he might recover some valuable\nproperty he had lost.\n\" I must tell you, however,\" he said to me, \" that I am an utter sceptic ;\nand it will require strong proof to convince me.\" I felt rather offended ; for\nif the girl was a humbug, I was a dupe or worse. I sent for Ruth, who was\nas indignant as myself. At first she distinctly refused to do the Sahib's\nbidding, but I impressed it upon her that the credit of both of us was at\nstake, on which she at length unwillingly consented. The usual prelimina\nries having been gone through, he questioned her through me, as follows :\u2014\n\" Go to Assigurgh and describe my bedroom in it.\"\nThis she did, correctly too, as he at once acknowledged.\n\" Now tell me what I have lost.\"\n\" I see a box, not a large box. It is a tin one, it contains money and a\nroll of papers.\"\n\"Right you are,\" exclaimed the astonished Major. \"Now tell me\nwhere that box is now.\"\n\" It is in a small room. Shall I open it 1 \"\n\" Yes, and tell me what is in it.\"\nShe paused a little.\n\" Only papers, Sahib, the money is gone.\"\n\"Describe the man who took it.\"\n\"He is not there, the room is empty.\"\n\" Look for him.\"\n\" He is in Sahib's room. He is a little dark man with a pleasant face ;\nhis dress is white ; he has a scarlet cummerbund, and a scarlet and gold\nturban. He has a scar on his left hand.\"\n2 N\n\f520 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\"My butler, by Jingo! The very man I suspected, too,\" cried the\nMajor.\n******\nA. few days afterwards, when Major had returned to Assigurgh, he\nwrote to me and told me he had found the box, as described, in his servant's\nhouse, or rather cabin ; but that no papers remained in it. It was empty.\nThis was the only thing that was not correct in Ruth's statement.\nI conclude she saw the box before the papers were removed from it. I\noften found that she did not seem to have much control over time, as\nregarded past events, though she would describe the actual occurrence rightly\nenough.\nAt another time I lost a piece of pale pink satin embroidered with silver.\nIt could be found nowhere. I was unwilling to believe that either of my\nservants had taken it, for they were devoted to me, and had one and all been\nin my service a long time, with the exception of my Dirzee.' I could not\nsuspect him of having taken it, as he never, by any chance, so far as I was\naware of, had access to my rooms. However, through Ruth he was detected\nas the thief, and returned the missing article, though he spread the report\nthat I was a witch afterwards on hearing how the theft had been discovered.\nIn this case, as will have been observed, the visions are of the\nretrocognitive type. Of the same class is the incident that follows,\n'which I quote from a recent article in the Contemporary Review,\ncalled \" Trace,\" signed with the pseudonym of \" J. M. Sonmes.\" Its\nwriter, as I am allowed to state, is Major Schreiber, a retired officer,\nknown to me.\nM. 55.\nWe arranged an afternoon for our experiments on the crystal, and after\ntea was over we set to work. My wife was placed in a very comfortable\nchair, and the lights were turned down\u2014not out by any means, but so as not\nto dazzle the eye, while at the same time everything was distinctly visible in\nthe room. I put her to sleep, and gave her the crystal. The effect was\ninstantaneous. She commenced speaking at once, and said :\u2014\n\"Oh, what lovely flowers, and what a perfume!\" And she began to\ndraw her breath through her nose, as if inhaling the scent of flowers. I\nasked her then where she was. She said, \" I am in the most lovely garden I\nhave ever seen. It is not in England. I am standing in a broad pathway ;\non one side is a hedge of white azaleas, and on the other pink. They are\nabout six or seven feet high ; between these hedges and the path there are\nbroad borders, in which are planted these sweet-smelling flowers. There are\nbeautiful trees all about the garden, such as I have never seen before ; and\nat the end of the path is a little black and gold house, with such a funny\nlittle man sitting outside.\"\nThis dream I ordered her to remember when she awoke, and there is a\nsequel to it that I will relate further on.\nShe resumea : \"I can see now a small shop at the junction of two streets,\nwith a door opening on tc each street. In the middle of the shop is a glass\n' A native tailor.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 527\ncase like those one sees in a jeweller's. There is a tall man, very like a\nJew, with a long black beard. He is bargaining with another man.\"\n\" What is the other man like ? \" I asked.\n\" He is about the middle height, and he has grey hair and moustache, a\nplain face. I know him. I have seen him, but I cannot tell you his name.\nThe funny little man has come down from the garden, and is sitting outside.\nHe seems very much interested in what is going on in the shop.\"\nThen followed a few more details that I do not remember. I then\nasked :\n\" Can you describe the situation of the town in which this shop is ? \"\n\"The town is a seaport, standing in a large bay. The coast seems nearly\nto join at the mouth of the harbour. On the land side it is backed by\nmountains covered nearly to the summits with the most luxuriant vege\ntation.\"\nThen came a pause, and she continued: \"I am on board ship. The\nman I recognised is here too. Oh, such a dreadful storm ; the ship is\nrolling about most fearfully. I cannot go on. I musfgo and lie down. I\nfeel so ill.\"\nMy wife exhibited all the symptoms of sea-sickness, and as I feared a\nfull realisation of the malady might follow, I woke her up, thinking we had\nobtained sufficient information for what we wanted.\nThe member of the society who had brought the crystal took it back\nnext day to the owner, who was the man with the grey hair and moustache,\nand gave him the information we had obtained the evening before. Ho told\nour friend the name of the town ; and, although he would not own up to\nthe truth of the story, it was easy to see that the information we had\nobtained was true in every detail. People of his sort are very unsatisfactory\nto deal with.\nThe curious sequel that I alluded to lies in the fact that my wife and\nmyself were one day, some months afterwards, going through one of the big\nmuseums in London. I was looking at a case of curiosities, and my wife\nwas some little way from me, when I heard her exclaim :\n\"I have been here ; I know the place quite well. That is where tho\nlittle man was sitting, and there is the little black and gold house.\"\n\" What nonsense are you talking t \" I said. \"That is impossible.\"\nBut then I remembered the experiment with the crystal, and upon going\nup to see what my wife was looking at, I found it was a model of the garden\nin the town where our grey-haired friend had owned to having obtained the\ncrystal.\nXIX.\u2014Enough, perhaps, has now been said to suggest to the\nreader that this crystal-vision, which has so long been disregarded as a\nmere superstition, may in reality be used with profit as an empirical\nmethod of educing from the subliminal self a number of pictures\u2014\nvery unequal, indeed, in value\u2014but of which some, at least, appear\nto imply a telepathic or clairvoyant extension of ordinary knowledge.\nStated, then, in its most general form, the lesson which sensory\nautomatism teaches us is that our centrally initiated sensations may\n2 n 2\n\f528 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nconvey instruction as to the external world as veritable as that which\nperipherally initiated sensations convey. Internal percepts\u2014arising\nindependently of evident sensory stimuli\u2014are of course just as normal\nas external percepts\u2014consequent upon known peripheral stimuli. I\nhere contend that those internal percepts may bring to us actual\nknowledge which external perception could never reach. It may, of\ncourse, be replied that this so-called extension of ordinary knowledge is\na farrago of error and triviality which can never be of practical service,\nand to which, such as it is, only a few favoured individuals can, on my\nown showing, hope to attain. \" Is it reasonable,\" it will be asked, \" to\nattribute so much importance to phenomena extremely rare and abso\nlutely useless 1\" I reply that to my argument it is no disadvantage\nthat the phenomena should be rare, and it is a positive advantage that\nthey should be useless. I am trying to discover the furthest limits of\nhuman faculty ; artd I have already endeavoured to define and unify\nthis scattered experimental inquiry by a wide hypothesis\u2014the hypo\nthesis, namely, that the evolutionary process of which we men are the\nresult is not a terrene process only, but a cosmioal ; and that our\nsupraliminal faculties, our specialised sensitivities, are but a selection\nfrom those which we potentially possess\u2014a selection determined by\nour race's terrene history, and the capabilities of organic matter. My\nend, therefore, will be attained if I can render it probable that here\nand there in humanity we discern powers which terrene evolution as\nwe conceive it could in no way have produced. The rarity of these\npowers is no drawback to the theory, if only we find sufficient instances\nof them to make us certain that they exist at all. No one will suppose\nthat in matters so fundamental we men are built on differing plans.\nAgain, if powers in one sense so transcendent are from a terrene\npoint of view unmanageable and ineffective ; if this unsteerable balloon\nof supernormal faculty is less practically serviceable than the humblest\npony-carriage of common-sense ;\u2014this surely is in itself precisely the\nindication which I desire that such faculty has not been developed on\nearth by the struggle for earthly existence, but must rather date from\nsome earlier and foreshadow some later evolution ; even as the rudimen\ntary organs of the imago within the larva indicate that it has sprung\nfrom a free-flying insect, and will thereto itself return. And in the\nsame way as we use artifice to help us to realise the detail of our\nexternal or optical percepts, so also ought we to use artifice to realise\nthe detail of our internal percepts. To speak paradoxically, the eye is\nnot our only means of seeing, nor is the world around us the only\nthing that we see.\nXX.\u2014Let me try to explain my meaning by a brief review of the\nforms of vision known to us, so arranged as to show the two diverging\nlines of visual perception ; the one tending outwards, the other in\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 529\nwards ; but both alike starting from a perceptivity whose primary or\ncentral seat I must here place vaguely in \" the brain.\"\nA. The whole group of synesthesie, of which so-called coloured\naudition\u2014better named \"sound-seeing\"\u2014is merely the most conspicuous\nmember, stand as it were on the dividing line or watershed between\nexternal and internal percepts. I speak of the synesthesie of specialised\nsenses ; of the response given by one sense to a stimulus capable of\nexciting the end-organ of another sense alone. We seem here to have\na kind of vestige of that undifferentiated continuous sensitivity from\nwhich we suppose our existing senses to have been specialised in the\nstraggle for life. And such repercussions or irradiations of sensitivity,\nwhen they take a visual\u2014I can hardly say an optical\u2014form in the\nchromatisms of the sound-seer, can scarcely be called a purely mental\nphenomenon. For in some subjects they seem to be determined before\nbirth, and to precede all conscious mentation. Nor, on the other hand,\ncan we exactly class them as external vision, since it is probable that\nin some other individuals they are developed only as the result of\nmental associations. As above suggested, it may be safest merely to call\nthem entencephalic\u2014on the analogy of entoptic\u2014since they seem to be\ndue to something in brain-structure somewhat in the same way as\nentoptic percepts are due to something in the structure of the eye.\nB. From these entencephalic photisms, at any rate, we seem to pass\nby an easy transition to the most inward fonn of entoptic vision\u2014\nwhich is therefore the most inward form of all external vision\u2014the\nflash of light consequent on electrisation of the optic nerve. Next on\nour outward road we may place the phosphenes caused by pressure on\nthe optic nerve or irritation of the retina. Next Purkinje's figures,\nor shadows cast by the blood-vessels of the middle layer upon the\nbacillary layer of the retina. Then muscce volitantes, or shadows cast\nby motes in the vitreous humour upon the fibrous layer of the retina.\nC. Midway, again, between entoptic and ordinary external vision\nwe may place after-images ; which, although themselves perceptible\nwith shut eyes, presuppose a previous retinal stimulation from without ;\n\u2014forming, in fact, the entoptic sequela* of ordinary external vision.\nD. Next comes our ordinary vision of the external world\u2014and this,\nagain, is pushed to its highest degree of externality by the employment\nof artificial aids to sight. He who gazes through a telescope at the\nstars has mechanically improved his end-organs to the furthest point\nnow possible to man.\nE. And now, standing once more upon our watershed of enten\ncephalic vision, let us trace the advancing capacities of internal vision.\nThe forms of vision now to be considered are virtually independent of\nthe eye ; they can persist, that is to say, after the destruction of the\neye, if only the eye has worked for a few years, so as to give visual\n\f530 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\neducation to the brain. We do not, in fact, fully know the limits of\nthis independence, which can only be learnt by a fuller examination of\nintelligent blind persons than has yet been made. Nor can we say\nwith certainty how far in a seeing person the eye is in its turn influenced\nby the brain. I shall avoid postulating any \" retropulsive current \"\nfrom brain to retina, just as I have avoided any expression more specific\nthan \" the brain \" to indicate the primary seat of sight. The arrange\nment here presented is a psychological one, and can be set forth with\nout trespassing on controverted physiological ground.\nWe may take memory-images as the simplest type of internal vision.\nThese images, as commonly understood, introduce us to no fresh know\nledge ; they preserve the knowledge gained by conscious gaze upon the\nouter world. In their simplest spontaneous form they are the cerebral\nsequele of external vision, just as after-images are its enloplic sequelse.\nAnd we have seen that in some cases these two classes of vision are\nconfounded. But we have seen also that into the cerebral storage of\nimpressions one element habitually enters which is totally absent from\nthe mere retinal storage, namely a psychical element\u2014a rearrangement\nor generalisation of the impressions retinally received.\nF. And by this imperceptible transition we pass from memory\nimages to imagination-images\u2014voluntary or involuntary recombina\ntions of retinal impressions which, although they do not bring us new\nstatements of external fact, do, nevertheless, bring us new ideas\u2014new\nexplanations of the observed facts, and, in short, the greater part of\nour power of controlling Nature. Among the more marked and\npeculiar developments of this class are illusions hypnayoyiques, and\nsome of the hallucinations of disease.\nG. And here, a generation ago, our categories of inward visuali\nsation would have come to an end. Our ordinary consciousness takes\nus thus far and no farther ; and we should be inclined to say that\nWatt, lying in bed in a dark room and conceiving the steam-engine,\nillustrated the utmost limit to which internal visualisation could go.\nBut somewhat as physical artifice came to the aid of external vision,\nand showed us through telescope and microscope external objects which\nwere in their own nature visible, but which our clumsy end-organs\ncould not reach ; so here also psychological artifice has come to our aid,\nand has shown us internal images, capable of visual presentation, but\nwhich our clumsy supraliminal consciousness could not reach. We\ncome to subliminal visualisations, rendered supraliminal by various\nempirical methods.\nThe simplest case is that of post-hypnotic suggestion. The en\ntranced subject is told to see a cat when he awakes, and sees it, with\nout remembering the suggestion, or knowing whence that cat really\ncomes. Here we have a simple subliminal picture\u2014in itself belonging\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 531\nto the class of imagination-images, but increased in intensity, and\nchanged in psychological import, by the fact of its transference from\none stratum of the personality to another. It has become what I have\ncalled a message ; a new piece of knowledge (in this case fictitious)\nintroduced into the ordinary flow of waking life, but not directly from\nthe external world. Or, if preferred, suppose that a real cat has been\nshown to the entranced subject, and that this special cat is then\nrecalled to him as a post-hypnotic hallucination. Here is a memory-\nimage\u2014a piece of real knowledge\u2014introduced into ordinary waking\nlife ; but not directly from the external world. That cat's image has\nlieen cerebrally stored in a different compartment from that in which\nthe memories of waking life are stored ; in a compartment whose key\ncan only be turned (by the subject himself or by his hypnotiser) during\nthe temporary abeyance of the supraliminal self. And if, indeed, the\nretina is used at all in the perception of this hallucinatory cat, it obeys\na retropulsive current, an impulse not from without but from within.\nH. This fast described class of visualisations, so significant, and as\nyet so imperfectly understood, forms, as I have already implied, the\nmost recent addition to the categories of vision which established\nScience recognises. But the next category in my scheme is one for\nwhich I hope ere long to obtain recognition. I allude to that class of\nvisual presentations which are not only subliminal in origin, but\nhypermnesic in content. In my last paper, on \" Hypermnesic Dreams,\"\nand in this present paper, I have tried to show that both dream and\ncrystal vision occasionally bring up into supraliminal consciousness\nvisual facts which provably were not observed by the supraliminal\nself, although they were within the range of ordinary vision. A\ntypical case of this kind is when someone hunts for a ring, fails to find\nit, and then dreams of it in a spot over which he has searched in vain\u2014\nand finds it there. In such a case the ring has lain within the field of\nvision, but has provably not been noted by the supraliminal self. It\nhas, however, been subliminally noted, and dream or crystal vision\nbrings to the surface this hidden knowledge. To this class also many\nspontaneous hallucinations belong.\nJ. I have said that this hypermnesic faculty, although not as yet\ncommonly recognised, is nevertheless likely, in my view, to be recog\nnised before long ; for it involves nothing which can be reckoned as\nantecedently very improbable. But from this category we slip almost\ninsensibly into another which soon introduces us to novelties of a more\nstartling kind. From hypermnesia we pass into hyperesthesia ; and\nhypersestheticvisualisations are soon indistinguishable from clairvoyance.\nThus, I have spoken of cases where some subliminal message, as by\ndream or crystal vision, presents to the supraliminal self a picture of\nan object which, though never \" consciously \" noted, has yet come\n\f532 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nwithin the range of ordinary vision. But we have seen also that there\nare cases where the object thus subliminally depicted has not come within\nthe range of ordinary vision. Up to a certain point we can explain this\nby assuming that some such hyperesthesia as is often noticeable in the\nhypnotic trance may be, in fact, habitual in the subliminal conscious\nness. But this will not carry us far. A point comes at which we can no\nlongerexplain the far-reaching perceptions by any excitement of the end-\norgans, but are obliged to fall back upon the hypothesis of telsesthesia'\ninstead of hyperesthesia ; and to ascribe the supernormal knowledge\nto some central perceptivity, apparently of a less speciabsed kind. In\nshort, we here reach clairvoyance, for which some evidence is given in\nthe present paper, but more in the articles of Mrs. Sidgwick, Proceed\nings, Vol. VII., p. 30, and p. 356.\nK. It is plain that when we have reached this point of generalised,\nperceptivity our series of forms of vision has reached its close. Just as,,\nwhen we follow the development of sensitivity in an outicard direction,,\nwe come to ever increasing specialisation ; so when we turn inwards\nwe come to ever increasing generalisation. That is to say, while our\noutward progress in perception consists in recognising, by ever more\nelaborate end-organs, an ever wider range of external facts, so does,\nour inward progress consist in recognising, by increased facility of\ntransmission from the subliminal to the supraliminal strata of our\nconsciousness an ever deeper range of forms of knowledge not\nthus specialised, but acquired by a subliminal perceptivity which,\nthough it may send up its messages in visual or auditory terms, does not\nitself depend upon any optical or acoustic mechanism.2 Various kinds\nI This word, which I originally suggested, along with telepathy, in 1883, still\nseems to me a better term for perception at a distance, assumed not to come directly\nfrom another mind, than (for instance) tclopry or telakousia, which I have seen proposed.\nFor it is desirable to bring out the fact that such distant perception is not effected in\naccordance with optical or acoustic laws ;\u2014is not conveyed by light-waves or sound\nwaves acting as we know them to act.\na Specially good illustration of this mode of generalised perception, only\ngradually attaining to definite visual symbolism, is afforded by a long case published\nby Professor Royce, of Harvard, in No. 4, pp. 397-400 of the Proceedings of the\nAmerican S.P.R. (now a branch of the English S.P.R.). I quote the description\ngiven by the percipient \"N,\"a lady physician. The experience was a veridical one\u2014\nthat is to say, the friend who was thus supernormally discerned, a Boston gentleman\nwell known to Professor Royce, testifies that an interchange of letters at the time\nproved conclusively to him that '\u2022 N's \" vision was coincident with a moment when,\nhe had in fact thrown himself face downward on his bed, in a large square room at a\nhotel, at 2 p.m., in great mental distress. There have been other telepathic\ncommunications between the same two persons.\n\" N \" writes to Professor Royce, August 16th, 188G :\u2014\n\" In the convalescence from a malarial fever, during which great hyperesthesia,\nof brain had obtained, but no hallucinations or false perceptions, I was sitting alone\nin my room looking out of the window. My thoughts were of indifferent trivialities ;\nafter a time my mind seemed to become absolutely vacant ; my eyes felt fixed, the\nair seemed to grow white. X could see objects about me, but it was a terrible effort of\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 533\nof cognition may be thus visually presented,\u2014as apparitions of living or\nof dead persons, retrocognitive or precognitive pictures. But although\nthe methods by which these various forms of knowledge may be origin\nally reached may be widely different, these differences are not necessarily\ndifferences of mode of vision. The visual form (so far as we can tell) is\nmerely the form in which the message is sent up from the subliminal to\nthe supraliminal strata, and the mere mechanism of these messages may\nbe the same, whether, for instance, the message be the telepathic\nannouncement that our fellow experimenter is at this moment looking\nat the ace of diamonds, or the retrocognitive announcement (as in a\ncase given above) that many years ago a grandfather was all but blown\nout to sea when duck-shooting\nXXI.\u2014If this be so, is there reason tohope that anyexperimentwhich\nwe can make, any artifice which we can use, will be able to extend our\ninternal vision, as telescope and microscope have extended the external i\nSuch artifice, it would seem, must be directed to improving,\u2014not the\nsupernormal presensory perceptivity itself, which we cannot hope directly\nto reach,\u2014but the facility of transmission of the visual symbols of that\nunknown perceptivity from a subliminal to a supraliminal strata. And\nthe crystal vision described in this paper is an empirical artifice\nof precisely this kind. It aims not at extending the purview of\nthe subliminal self, but at eliciting visual messages from that\nself in a clear and convenient form. Some such messages it does\nprovably and undoubtedly obtain. Many men, indeed, will deny this,\njust as many men denied the reality of the cognate phenomenon of\nautomatic writing when I first urged that method of experimentation\nupon the attention of readers of these Proceedings. But just as I then\nfelt confiden -with a confidence which the event has justified\u2014that\nso soon as sufficient experiments should be tried, the reality and\nvnll to perceive anything. I then felt great and painful sense as of sympathy with\nsomeone suffering, who or where I did not know. After a little time I knew with\nwhom, but how I knew I cannot tell ; for it seemed some time after this knowledge of\npersonality that I saw distinctly in my brain, not before my eyes, a large, square\nroom, evidently in a hotel, and saw the person of whom I had been conscious, lying\nface downwards on the bed, in the throes of mental and physical anguish. I felt\nrather than heard sobs and grieving, and felt conscious of the nature of the grief\nsubjectively ; its objective cause was not transmitted to me. Extreme exhaustion\nfollowed the experience, which lasted forty minutes intensely, and then very slowly\nwore away. Let me note :\u2014\n\" 1. I had not thought of the person for some time, and there was no reminder in\nthe room.\n\" 2. The experience was remembered with more vividness than that seen in tho\nnormal way, while the contrary is true of dreams.\n\"3. The natural order of perception was reversed, i.e., the emotion came first, the\nsense of a personality second, the vision or perception of the person third.\n\"I should be glad to have a theory given of this reverse in the natural order of\nperception.\"\n\f534 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nimportance of automatic script would become evident, whatever\nview might be taken as to the limit to which its revelations extended ;\nso now also do I feel confident\u2014and Professor Janet's experience has\nalready confirmed my confidence\u2014that so soon as sufficient experiments\nhave been made in crystal vision, its reality and importance will\nbecome evident, whatever view may be taken as to the limits to which\nits revelations extend.\nIt is to the rising generation of experimental psychologists\u2014to the\nstudents in psycho-physical laboratories\u2014that my appeal is in the first\ninstance made. But so scattered is the capacity of sensory automatism,\nso unknown its conditions, that I am anxious that all my readers\nshould try my suggested experiments, and should send to me at\nCambridge full reports of the results obtained.\nIt is this need of wide co-operation which must be my excuse for\nthe bold and comprehensive way in which I have set forth the\nhypotheses to which this experiment points. If there is to be wide\nspread effort there must be widespread interest ; and such interest can\nonly be evoked by an understanding of the vast importance of the\ndiscovery to which these small and scattered inquiries do manifestly,\nalthough remotely, tend.\nThe question is of nothing less than the possible establishment of a\ncosmic law of the first order\u2014a law which shall lie at the root of\nPsychology, in the same way as the law of Evolution lies at the root of\nBiology, and the law of Conservation at the root of Physics, and the\nlaw of Uniformity at the root of Science itself. The possible law of\nwhich I speak is that of the Interpenetration of Worlds ;\u2014some\nstatement in terms as scientific as may be possible of the ancient belief\nin a spiritual universe, co-existing with, and manifesting itself through,\nthe material universe which we know ;\u2014somewhat as our hypothetical\nether, neither material nor spiritual, co-exists with, and manifests\nitself through, our world of ponderable things.i I believe that the\ni Or if the interstellar ether be in itself a conception too remote and disputable\nto serve as starting-point for speculations more remote and disputable still, let us\nembody in a short apologue the attitude of mind which might have existed on the\neve of a much simpler discovery.

It appears that\nthat sense has recently been evolved amongst them, at a singular moment in their\nscientific history. It has long been the first principle of Aphrodisian science that tho\nmaterial organism could be affected only by stimuli propagated through material\nmedia ; as in the senses of touch, taste, and smell. Heat they explained as propa\ngated by atmospheric conduction from some indiscoverable but intra-atmosplieric\nhource. The sense of hearmg was long a difficulty, and the ignorant were fond of\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 535\nfuture of Experimental Psychology\u2014to say no more than this\u2014lies\nin the question whether she can prove this law or no. If she fails, her\nknowledge must needs remain for ever superficial and fragmentary.\nIf she succeeds, then indeed she may claim that all other Science\nis but the ancilla psychologice, and all other quests the preparation and\npreliminary for this quest which knows no end.\nMark, then, the inward pictures ; for now we see, as St. Paul has\nit, \" in a mirror, darkly \"; and to pierce deepest into the universe\nit may be needful to gaze within. To these messages perchance,\nwe have been slowly tending, through all the tidings borne to\nus on air-wave or ethereal ray. For it may be that our out\nward senses have been leading us towards a sense pvofounder than\nthey all ;\u2014have been shaping the symbolism, piercing the channels\u2014\nccecai fores et pervius usus\u2014whereby these sensory and motor\nautomatisms of script and voice and vision shall guide us among the\ninward palace-halls which hold the hope of our race.

Myers.\nquoting it as a miraculous exception to the settled order of things. But when a\nleading Aphrodisian satant proved that sound was transmitted by material atmo\nspheric waves, the triumph of orthodox Science was complete, and the doctrine of\n'molecular transmission ' was inculcated as self-evident truth.\n\" It happened, however, that on one of the days of clear sky so rare on that\nplanet, a random experimenter observed that the heat passing through a glass bowl\nof water stung his hand at a particular point. He proved that no conduction could\nthus concentrate the heat ; he assumed a new form of energy, which he called\nradiation ; and he attempted to show that his so-called rays need not be transmitted\nthrough a material medium at all. Continuing his experiment for years, whenever\nthe climate allowed, he gradually plotted out the apparent path of his imaginary\nsource of radiant heat ; and even located it at a distance far outside atmospheric\nlimits. He was naturally censured as flying in the plain face of reason in order to\nsolve the puzzle of a useless toy. Gradually, however, certain Aphrodisians\ndeveloped pigment-spots, which received a vague but novel sensation when turned in\nthe direction from whence the intensest heat came. These men felt with uneasiness\nthat there was something odd about the workings of Nature ; but they joined, never\ntheless, in the outcry against the innovator ; remarking with force that to revo\nlutionise the Laws of the Universe in order to explain a few paltry residual\nphenomena was like invoking Satanic agency to explain how the guinea-pig got into\nthe conjurers hat. Evolution, however, pursued its wonted course ; and at last a\nnumber of Aphrodisians found themselves possessed of eyes. Some excuse was then\nmade for the long-deceased innovator's eccentricity, for it was evident that this blind\nobserver had, in point of fact, discovered the Sun.\"\n\f536 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nIV.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nBy Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nIntroductory.\nThe experiments here to be recorded were a continuation of those\ndescribed in a paper on \" Experiments in Thought-transference \" by\nProfessor and Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr. G. A. Smith, published in the\nProceedings, Vol. VI., p. 128. The percipients were two young clerks,\nP. and T., with whom most of the previous experiments were made,\nand a young lady, Miss B., who was also one of our former percipients.\nIn addition we had some experiments with three men in a less\nestablished position in society, named Whybrew, Major and Adams,\nwho had come to Brighton in the train of a man giving hypnotic\nexhibitions and had remained behind there.\nProfessor Sidgwick was prevented by other engagements from taking\nmuch part in the present series, which has been carried out by Mrs.\nSidgwick, generally assisted by Miss Alice Johnson, and occasionally\nby Dr. A. T. Myers and others. Mr. G. A. Smith again acted as\nhypnotiser throughout, except on one evening when T. was hypnotised\nby Professor Barrett, and on two or three occasions when several of\nthe subjects were hypnotised by Miss Charlesworth, a lady who came\nto help us in the experiments for a few days in July, 1891, but who did\nnot succeed in obtaining thought-transference with these subjects. The\nexperiments were all made at Brighton, where the principal per\ncipients lived, and we made them sometimes in Mr. Smith's rooms and\nsometimes in our own lodgings.\nIt will be remembered that the previous series of experiments con\nsisted chiefly in the guessing of numbers of two digits. Mr. Smith was\nin all cases\u2014of success at least\u2014the agent, and when agent and per\ncipient were in the same room the success was very marked. With\nagent and percipient in different rooms there was some slight success\nwhen P. was percipient, but none with T., and with Miss B. it was\nscarcely tried.\nThe object of the present series of experiments was in the first\nplace to obtain more complete evidence of thought-transference with\nagent and percipient in different rooms and, if possible, at greater\ndistances. We also varied the experiments partly with a view to\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 537\nobtaining additional proof that no physical indications reached the\npercipient consciously or unconsciously, and partly in the hope of\nlearning something about the conditions necessary to success. With\nthese objects, we made experiments in the transference of ideas other\nthan numbers, and sometimes employed automatic writing, table-tilting\nand hallucinations as a means of getting at the percipient's impressions.\nIn addition we carried out a series of experiments in producing local\nJinesthesia and rigidity by, as we believe, mental suggestion.\nIt will be convenient to arrange the account of our experiments\nunder three heads, namely, experiments in transferring numbers,\nexperiments in transferring ideas other than numbers, experiments in\nproducing local anesthesia and rigidity by mental suggestion.\nI. Experiments in Transferring Numbers of Two Digits.\nThe later trials made with P. and T. in 1889 were, it will be\nremembered, very unsuccessful. Considering the brilliant success\nobtained before with these percipients, this later failure led us to think\nthat their capacity might, for some unknown reason, be exhausted\u2014at\nleast for the time. Possibly it was owing to the interest of the process\nhaving worn off with its novelty, and the whole thing having become\ndull and tiresome. For though, in their normal or waking state, they\nknew little or nothing of it, their hypnotic consciousness recurred to\nthe number-guessing as a familiar and somewhat monotonous task.\nIn January, 1890, we were fortunate in again obtaining the\nassistance of Miss B., with whom we had previously been able to try\nexperiments on two occasions only, and with this change in our per\ncipients, success returned. We were able to carry on experiments with\nher at intervals through 1890.\nIt will be unnecessary to dwell on experiments in number-guessing\ncarried on with agent and percipient in the same room, as the\npossibility of this with P., T. and Miss B. was sufficiently shown by\nthe experiments of 1889. In the course of the present series, we only\ntried experiments under these conditions in order to encourage the\npercipients, or in the hope of throwing light on the causes of failure\nunder different conditions.\nDescription of Booms in which the Experiments were carried on.\nOur first attempts with agent and percipient in different rooms,\nwith Miss B. as percipient, were made at an \" arch \" on the beach at\nBrighton, occupied at the time by Mr. Smith. The arch was\nfitted up with two floors, the upper entirely occupied by a sitting-room,\nmeasuring about 1 5 feet square, out of which a staircase\u2014not enclosed\n\f538 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nabove, but closed at the bottom by a door\u2014led down to a lobby. The\nground floor consisted of this lobby with small rooms at the back and\non one side. A rough plan will make the arrangement clearer.\nUpstairs\nRoom\nWindow |~\nBack room\nKitchen Lobby\nDoor\nThe partitions were of matchboarding. The upper floor was covered\nwith a very thick Axminster carpet with felt underneath it. The height\nof the lower rooms was 7 feet 5 inches, and the space between the upper\nand lower rooms fully 10 inches, including the floor above and match\nboard ceiling below. The separation of agent in the lobby and per\ncipient upstairs was not, for auditory purposes, so great as it would have\nbeen in two floors of an ordinary house, because of the staircase, but\nthe words in ordinary conversation could not be distinguished from one\nfloor to the other by persons of normal powers of hearing, except by\nplacing the ear against the door or the partition of the staircase. We\ntried whether Miss B. when hypnotised could catch any words of a\nconversation going on below, but though she has very good hearing she\nappeared to be unable to do so.\nWhen upstairs at the Arch, the percipients' position in the room\nwas often varied, as well as the direction in which they faced.\nDetails of the Two First Evenings.\nThe first experiments of this series with Miss B. were made on\nJanuary 6th, 1890. The persons present were Miss B., Professor\nBarrett, Mr. Smith, Mre. Sidgwick, Miss Johnson and T.; but T., with\nwhom we had been experimenting, was hypnotised and not attending-\nto what was going on. Mr. Smith hypnotised Miss B. and tried three\nnumbers while in the room with her and speaking to her. There was\nsome success with these, and then Mr. Smith and Miss Johnson 'went\ndownstairs to the lobby. Miss Johnson drew a number at random out\nof a bag containing all the numbers from 1 0 to 90 and handed it to Mr.\nSmith, who then tried to communicate it mentally to Miss B. A little\nbell or gong was rung upstairs by Mrs. Sidgwick as soon as a guess had\nbeen made and again when the party upstairs were ready to begin\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 53D\nanother. As the bell was rung, Mrs. Sidgwick, who had previously\nbeen put en rapport with Miss B., said : \" There's another, Miss B.,\"\nor words to that effect ; and Miss B. began to look out for an impres\nsion, which usually came to her in a visual form. Mrs. Sidgwick noted\ndown her guesses and remarks, while Miss Johnson noted the number\nthat she drew from the bag, and at intervals we compared notes.\nEight guesses were made in this way. The first two were failures,\nbut in the remaining six the first digit was right in each case. More\nover, in two out of the six, Miss B. first gave the completely right\nnumber, but then changed her mind as to the second digit. Thus, the\nnumber being 21, she said : \"It's never another 2, is it ? 2 and a 1 ?\n8\u201428.\" And again, with the last of the six, which was 41, she said :\n\" 4\u2014better not go on doing any more or I shall never be right, I'm\nsure. 4\u20141 1 Looks like a 1 : 46.\" This occurred on other occasions\nalso. It is hardly necessary to say that, as Mrs. Sidgwick was herself\nwholly ignorant of the number, it was impossible for her remarks to\ngive any indications to Miss B.\nOn the next evening, seventeen experiments were made under the\nsame conditions, except that at first Professor Barrett took Miss John\nson's place downstairs, and that after the first eleven guesses T. came\nin, was hypnotised, and also tried guessing upstairs. Miss B.'s success\nwas about the same in proportion as on the previous evening. T.'s\nguesses were different from hers, and she did not seem to be influenced\nby them at the time,1 but it seems possible that they affected her\nimpressions afterwards, for out of the six numbers guessed after T.\nhad come, two of Miss B.'s\u2014one quite wrong, and one with the second\ndigit only right\u2014were numbers that had been guessed by T.\u2014in one\ncase two, and in the other three, guesses before. In her other four\nguesses, out of these six, the first digit was right.\nAttempts made on this evening to transfer impressions of coloured\nlight flashed in Mr. Smith's eyes, and of other sensations and objects,\nfailed. Nor could Miss B. tell in what position the number looked at\nby Mr. Smith was held.\nIt would be tedious to describe each day's experiments minutely,\nand the following table will, perhaps, show sufliciently what was done.\nWe add at the end of it, for comparison, the results of experiments\nwith agent and percipient in the same room.\ni They were not put en rapport with one another, but on one occasion, at least,\nMiss B. must have heard T.'s guess, for she said emphatically that she saw a different\nnumber.\n\f540 Mrs. H.

The odds against getting as many as 27 right in 252 trials by\nchance are enormous.\nThere is a rather marked culmination of success on January 12th\n\u2014an evening on which we did a large number of experiments\u2014and it\nis interesting that, of the complete successes, six occurred in the last\ntwelve. The fact, however, of our success on this occasion made us\ndesirous of obtaining the same success under other conditions of place\nand subject to be guessed, so that less time was devoted to this par-\n* Two of these were guessed quite rightly first and then changed.\nI This was guessed quite rightly first and then changed.\n2 o\n\f542 Mrs. H. Sidgtvick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nticular form of experiment after this. External noises did not seem\nto interfere with success. On the 12th of January the noise of the\nsea and of people passing and talking was very distinct, the window\nbeing open, and there were also a great many people walking on the\nesplanade over the Arch,1 as it happened to be a particularly fine\nevening.\nAnother noticeable point is the very large prevalence of guesses in\nwhich the first digit was right over those in which the second was right.\nThe first digit ought of course to be right by chance more often than\nthe second in the proportion of 10 to 8-1, because of the exclusion of\nnumbers above 90, and the impossibility of the first digit being 0. But\nthe difference, especially in January, was enormously in excess of what\ncould be thus accounted for. And\u2014what is more remarkable\u2014the same\nexcess does not appear in experiments in which both agent and per\ncipient were in the same room. We can only suggest that Mr. Smith\nfirst unconsciously concentrated his mind on the first digit and, when he\nwas in the room and knew therefore when one had been guessed, then\ntransferred his attention to the other. When out of the room, he\ncould not, of course, follow the process of guessing in the same way.\nAgainst this hypothesis, however, we must observe that Miss B. some\ntimes seemed to see first\u2014or, at any rate, named first\u2014numbers\nwhich she ultimately, and sometimes rightly, placed second. And that\nP., whose guesses will be spoken of presently, also exhibited a\ntendency to guess the first digit more often right than the second ;\nbut that he did so\u2014contrary to his practice in 1889\u2014with the agent\nin the room with him as well as when they were in separate rooms.\nThe next point we would call attention to is the large proportion of\nfailures when the agent was upstairs and the percipient downstairs at\nthe Arch. We think this may possibly have been due to Miss B.'s not\nbeing at her ease downstairs. She was always sensitive to appear\nances, whether hypnotised or not, and some of her remarks showed\nthat, though she made no objection to being led downstairs in the\nhypnotic trance and seated in the lobby, yet she knew where she was,\nand was a little afraid of someone coming in from outside and seeing her.\nThis supposition is somewhat confirmed by the difficulty being overcome\non June 17th, when, on the spur of the moment, Mrs. Sidgwick sug\ngested for the first time placing Miss B. in the back room. On.\nthis occasion P. was joint agent with Mr. Smith, so that the experiments\ndo not appear in the foregoing table, but in Table II., where it will be\ni On the other hand, a great hubbub outside, which sometimes occurred owing to\na quarrel or a showman on the beach, was liable to disturb the hypnotised person\nwithout his exactly knowing why he was uneasy. Our notes do not, however, record\nany such disturbance in the case of Miss B.\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 543\nseen that there were three completely successful trials in eighteen. The\nconditions as regards possible auditory indications were naturally less\ngood with the agent upstairs, his movements being then more audible\nto the percipient and to those with her. Having succeeded under\nthese conditions, therefore, we thought it needless to multiply ex\nperiments.\nIn sixty-one of the above experiments, either P. or T. were joint\npercipients with Miss B., that is to say, they were also trying to guess\nthe number. This does not seem on the whole to have modified the\nresult in any marked way, the proportion of Miss B.'s correct guesses\nunder these circumstances being very much the same as when she was\nguessing by herself. In such experiments the percipients were rarely\nen rapport with one another and were not aware of hearing each other\nspeak. Nevertheless, it is pretty certain that they were influenced\noccasionally by each other's guesses, as mentioned above (see also\nProceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 163, 164). It happens that no completely\nsuccessful guess was ever made jointly.\nDistances between Agent and PercipieiU.\nAt Mrs. Sidgwick's lodgings, the distance between the agent and\npercipient was generally greater than at the Arch. The passage, or\nlanding, where Mr. Smith was, was 6 feet wide, and he was on the\nfurther side of it, Miss Johnson sitting between him and the door. On\nDecember 20th, the percipient sat 13 feet from the door. On the 17th,\nshe sat about 9 feet from it, in another direction. On the 19th, her\nposition was, we believe, the same as on the 17th, but any statement as\nto this was accidentally omitted from our notes. The corresponding\ndistances between agent and percipient in a straight line must have\nbeen about 17 feet and 12 feet, whereas, at the Arch, the distance\nbetween their heads was from 10 to 12 feet according to Miss B.'s\nposition.\nNature and Development of the Percipients' Impressions.\nDuring all the above recorded experiments up to December, Miss B.\nwas hypnotised, and her impressions about the numbers came to her in\na visual form, generally seeming to develop gradually. Sometimes\n(though only on July 8th, among the experiments so far enumerated)\nwe opened her eyes and made her see the number as a hallucination\non paper, telling her to trace it in pencil. When she did this, the\nnumber sometimes appeared in a fragmentary way, so that she could\nnot tell at first what it was. It was liable to appear and disappear, as\nhappened when the images were seen with closed eyes, and\noccasionally one number would come on the top of another and then go\naway again. ^\n\f544 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nWhen the agents were at considerably greater distances than those\nabove recorded, the impressions were apt to be unusually transient and\nsometimes were not visualised at all. In these more distant experi\nments, too, Miss B. frequently complained of the numbers being far\noff. \" They're all muddled up, the numbers seem miles off,\" she said\non one occasion. She did not recognise this as due to the distance\nof the agent (who was then in a room two floors below her), of which,\nindeed, she was not supposed to be aware. T. also complained of\nthe apparent distance of the numbers when the agent was out of the\nroom. Sometimes the percipient had no impression at all, and this\noccurred much more often when the agent was at a distance than\nwhen he was near.\nOn one evening, when the agent (P.) was at our lodgings and the\npercipients Miss B. and T. at the Arch, we told them that they would\nhear the numbers repeated, instead of seeing them. The suggestion\ntook effect without difficulty, but the illusion of the nearness of the\nagent could not be produced. T., on being asked if he could distinguish\nP.'s voice, replied : \" Oh, you know it is so low, so far away. He says,\nhush ! hush ! and then whispers.\"\nExperiments with Table-tilting.\nIn December, we tried whether good results would be obtained\nby placing the hypnotised subjects' hands on a table, which they\ntilted unconsciously, tilting out the numbers, etc. They had not\ntried table-tilting before, they told us, and we had to educate them to\nit, but this was quickly done. The first attempt was made on\nDecember 15th, when Miss B. and T. had their hands on the table\nand some experiments with Mr. Smith as agent in the same room were\nsuccessful. In the experiments recorded in Table I. for December\n17th, Miss B. in a normal condition was sitting at the table with Mrs.\nSidgwick and Miss Robertson, and tilted out the numbers with it.\nDuring both the sets of experiments recorded in Table L for December\n19th she was hypnotised and her hands were on a tilting table, but P.'s\nor T.'s were also on the same table, so we have only included the verbal\nguesses she was making at the same time, the results of the table-tilting\nnot being clearly due to her. On this day we also tried some rather\nunsuccessful experiments in which Miss B. tried to guess numbers by\ntable-tilting in a normal state, T. being agent with Mr. Smith.\nOn December 20th, four experiments were made in which Miss B.,\nhypnotised, guessed in the usual way and by table-tilting at the\nsame time. The results are shown bracketed together in Table I. and\nare both counted. Then seven experiments were made with Miss B.\nguessing in the usual way, without the table, and the last fourteen were\nmade while she was in a perfectly normal state, not guessing verbally at\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 545\nall, but tilting out the numbers by the table automatically, apparently\nquite unconscious that her own muscles were moving it.\nWe had tried a few experiments with Miss B. in January in\nwhich she simply tried to get a mental impression of the number in\nthe normal state, and we obtained three complete successes in fifteen\ntrials, but in these trials the agent was in the room with her.\nAgency of P. and T.\nBetween June and Decembe 1890, a number of experiments\n\u2022were tried under conditions similar to the above, but with P. or T. as\njoint agents with Mr. Smith, and sometimes as sole agents. We have\nthought it best to tabulate these separately, because P. and T. cannot\nbe regarded as responsible for the bona fides of the experiments in the\nsame way that Mr. Smith and ourselves are. At the same time, in the\nparticular class of experiment we are at present discussing\u2014the\ntransference of numbers from one room to another with a closed door\nbetween\u2014all methods of signalling except rather coarse auditory ones\nseem to be excluded and, although the agents (who were of course\nunder close observation all the time) were not always noiseless, no such\nsignals were detected.i\ni There were a few indications that sounds may now and then have determined\nguesses, just as the guess of a co-percipient sometimes did. On one occasion, when P.\nwas agent and Miss B. percipient in the same room, Mrs. Verrall who was present\ntried to infer the. number from sounds (coughs, etc,) made by P., and out of four\nguesses twice guessed the same as Miss B., but they were not the right numbers.\nOn the other hand, Mrs. Sidgwick several times, while experiments were going on,\ntried\u2014without telling the subjects so,\u2014to suggest numbers to them by indications such\nas tapping slightly on their hands, or their chairs, in order to test theirsensitiveness to\nhints of the kind. They never named the number she was trying to suggest, though\nsometimes the sum of the two digits was the same in both cases, e.g., 37 was guessed\nfor 10 and 85 for 70 consecutively in a group of four trials, but little stress can be laid\non so few instances.\n\f546 Alrs.

We ourselves both failed, whether in\nthe same room with her or not, and so did one or two others who made\na few trials.\nDistant Experiments.\nWe were extremely anxious to succeed with agent and percipient\nat greater distances than in the experiments recorded above, and\nnearly four hundred trials were made with Miss B. as percipient,\nand the agent or agents either in a different building or divided\nfrom her by at least two closed doors and a passage ; but we obtained\npractically no success.\nThe reason of the failure is difficult to surmise, unless it was the\neffect of the distance on the imagination of the agent or the percipient.\nWe did not usually tell the percipient where the agent was, and at first\nused to try to produce the illusion that he was near, but we think that\nthe percipient was generally aware in a vague way of his absence.\nExperiments of this kind were generally much more wearisome than\nthose at closer quarters, especially as most of them were timed by\nwatches, instead of signals being given for beginning and ending, and\nthis, on account of the varying length of time before the percipient\nhad an impression, entailed a good deal of tiresome waiting on the part\n\f548 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nof the percipient and of tediously prolonged thinking of the number\non the part of the agent. We usually found it necessary to allow two\nminutes for each guess. But we do not think that this is by itself\nsufficient to account for the failure, as, in about one hundred of the\nexperiments, we communicated with each other at the conclusion of\neach guess without better results.\nDeferred Successes.\nAs in the experiments of 1889 (see Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 101), it\nhappened in a few instances that, when the agent was looking at a\nnumber, the percipient guessed the number he had been looking at\nin the trial immediately preceding, without having had any opportunity\nof learning by normal means what that number was. Such \"deferred\nsuccesses \" are seen in the following series of five consecutive trials\nwith Miss B. as percipient, which occurred on July 7th, 1890.\nNos. drawn. Nos. rjaesscd.

She made 997 guesses altogether, of\nwhich eighty-nine were successful. As there were eighty-one different\nnumbers, evenly distributed guesses would have given about twelve to\neach. The actual frequency of her naming of individual numbers\nranged from nought to thirty-five, while the frequency of drawing of\nindividual numbers ranged from two to twenty-two. The number least\noften drawn (only twice) was 39, and that most often drawn (twenty-\ntwo times) was 55. She guessed 55 only seven times (once rightly).\nThe number named by her thirty-five times (three times rightly) was 58,\nand this was drawn seventeen times. No other numbers were named\nso often as thirty times. The following numbers were named twenty\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 549\ntimes or more :\u201414, 15, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 52,\n54, 56, 63, 64, 65, 67. The numbers named between twelve and twenty\ntimes were 12, 16, 27, 38, 43, 51, 53, 62, 68, 73, 74, 86. Among num\nbers named less than twelve times, those named once only were 19, 49,\n79, 80 ; those named twice only were 29, 60, 82 ; those named three\ntimes only were 33, 39, 44, 66, 77, 88. The only numbers in the bag\nwhich were never named were 40 and 90. Three times Miss B. named\nnumbers above 90.\nMiss B. exhibited more marked number habits as regards individual\ndigits, and these differed for first and second digits, as the following\ntable shows :\u2014\nDigit named 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 7 8 9 0\nNumber of times it was\nnamed as the first digit. 136\n70\n171\n109\n157\n107\n70\n153\n172\n135\n135 88 05\n146\n3\n21\nNumber of times it was\nnamed astheseconddigit. 1241 94 38\nI\nHer successful guesses were very unequally distributed. It will be\nmore instructive here to consider only those made under the conditions\nwhich did not appear to interfere with success, those, namely, in\nwhich Mr. Smith, P., or T. were agents and not divided from\nMiss B. by more than one closed door. There were 547 experi\nments under these conditions (including some done by table-tilting\nin which P. and T. shared) of which eighty-one were successes.\nThis gives an average of six draws and one successful guess to each\nnumber. As a matter of fact, the frequency of drawing varied from\none in the case of 66 i to sixteen in the case of 26, and the frequency\nof correct guessing from nought in a large number of cases (including\n26) to eight in the case of 51. The larger proportion of correct\nguesses among the 547 trials now under consideration involves, as\nmight be expected, a somewhat closer correspondence between the\nfrequency of drawing and of correct guessing than is observable when\nthe whole 997 trials are considered, but the only very marked instance\nof such correspondence is the case of 51, which was drawn fourteen\ntimes and guessed correctly eight times. The number 56, which was\nguessed correctly seven times, turned up eight times. The number\n25 was guessed correctly four times and turned up seven times ;\nand 16, 41, 58, 622 were guessed correctly three times and turned up\nfour, eight, eight and five times respectively. Twelve different numbers\ni It turned up another time, but was then accidentally read as 99.\n* 51, 56 and 25 were named by Miss B. altogether nineteen, twenty-three and\ntwenty-nine times respectively. 10, 58 and 62 were al\u00abo named above the average\nnumber of times, but 41 was only named seven time-!.\n\f550 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nwere guessed correctly twice each. Of these, nine turned up more\nthan six times, two six times, and one five times. Twenty-six numbers\nwere correctly guessed only once, and thirty-six not at all. Of those\nnever guessed correctly, thirteen turned up over six times.\nOther Percijrients than Miss B.\nMiss B. was undoubtedly our best percipient. With Mr. Smith as\nagent, T. had no success in number-guessing worth quoting during the\nnineteen months over which the present series of experiments extended,\neven when agent and percipient were in the same room. P. did rather\nbetter, for in ninety-one attempts with agent and percipient in separate\nrooms with a closed door between them, he was quite right five times,\nand in addition gave the first digit rightly eighteen times and the second\nthree times. This is perhaps sufficient to show the existence of some\nagency other than chance, and the success is not very inferior to that\nwhich he had during the same period when the agent was in the room\nwith him. Most of his success under both conditions was during the\nlatter part of the period.\nWith two of the new percipients already mentioned\u2014Whybrew\nand Adams\u2014we obtained three complete successes out of sixteen\nand twelve guesses respectively, agent and percipient being in the\nsame room. The only interest of this is in the fact that they were\nfresh percipients. We did not succeed with them at greater distances,\nbut the number of trials made was small.\nIt is curious that though T. was the least successful on the whole of\nour three principal percipients, he showed greater signs of success with\nother agents than P. or Miss B. did. One day, when he had been\nhypnotised by Professor Barrett, he named two numbers rightly and\none with digits in reverse order out of thirteen thought of by Professor\nBarrett. The latter had his hand on T.'s forehead. The next day he\nfailed, but in 1889 we had found him very variable.\nHis success with ourselves was also slightly above what might be\nexpected by chance. We had between us seventy trials with him and\nthree complete successes, all of which occurred on the same day out of\nseventeen trials, but we can lay no stress on this, because the number of\nhalf successes was below the most probable number, which renders it of\ncourse more likely that the complete successes were the result of chance.\nP. showed signs of success one day with Major Hughes as agent,\nbut it was promise rather than performance, and no completely\nsuccessful guesses were made.\nComparison of Verbal Guesses with those made unconsciously.\nWith the method\u2014used only on one evening, November 10th, 1890\n\u2014of getting the percipient to guess numbers both verbally and with a\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 551\nplanchette,' the two guesses were in most cases different. This was\nespecially so with Miss B., the amount of coincidence between the two\nsets of guesses being decidedly below what chance would give\u2014only one\ndigit the same in the same place in twenty pairs of guesses. These\nguesses took place all on one evening but in two sets, experiments in the\ntransference of \" mental pictures \" being tried in the interval. With\nP., on the other hand, the connection between the corresponding guesses\nwas close. Out of six consecutive trials, in one case the two guesses\nwere the same, in two cases they contained the same digits but in\nreverse order, and in the other three cases the second digit was the\nsame in both guesses.\nThere was a curious variety in the results with T. He first made\nsix consecutive double guesses, the only coincidence between them being\nthat the first digit of one of his verbal guesses was the same as the\nsecond digit of the corresponding guess with the planchette. He was\nthen awakened for a few minutes and rehypnotised, when another\ndouble guess, with no coincidence in it, was made. He was then slightly\nroused and again put into a deeper state than before, in which, however,\nno impressions occurred to him. He was therefore completely awakened\nand rehypnotised, and five fresh trials with the planchette were made.\nIn the first four of these he said exactly what the planchette wrote,,\nbut in the fifth something quite different again.\nIn the course of this whole evening, the guesses m.'tde with planchette\nboth by Miss B. and T. were decidedly less successful than their verbal\nguesses.\nOn the same evening, five experiments (fully described in a\nlater part of this paper) were made in the transference of \" mental\npictures \" to Miss B. as percipient, in which she was writing with\nthe planchette and describing her impressions verbally at the same time.\nIn only three cases did the planchette write anything intelligible and\nwhat was written seemed to be chiefly vague and confused reminiscences\nof previous impressions, one partially correct guess only being made\nwith the planchette, while Miss B. made two verbally.\nWe thought that the subjects were not aware of what the plan\nchette was writing, whether they guessed the same verbally or not. Thus\nMiss Johnson once asked Miss B. : \"What did planchette write? do you\nknow 1\" Miss B. shook her head and answered : \"No. I see 12 ; I\nsuppose it writes 1 2.\" It had actually written 25. She probably supposed\nit had written 12 because she had been told that it would write the\ncorrect numbers, and her seeing 12 made her suppose that was correct.\nWith the table-tilting, the subjects were certainly sometimes con\nscious of what numbers were being tilted. In the first experiments of\ni A well-known instrument for facilitating automatic writing.\n\f552 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nthis kind they were not guessing verbally at the same time and\ntherefore had nothing to distract their attention from the movements\nof the table, in which they were much interested. This was when they\nwere hypnotised. When Miss. B. was table-tilting in a normal\ncondition, she was fully aware of its movements, though apparently\nnot at all aware of what number was going to be tilted, as her conscious\nimpression as to the number looked at by Mr. Smith was generally\ndifferent from the number tilted by the table, whether she was\nhypnotised or not. T., on the other hand, when hypnotised, followed\nthe table almost exactly in six consecutive verbal guesses without\napparently being at all aware that he was doing so. Thus the table\ntilted 82, after which he said \"82,\" and when Miss Johnson asked\nbim what the table had tilted, he replied that he did not take any\nnotice of it. Probably this was a perfectly genuine remark, as there\nwere other indications of the table movements belonging to a separate\nstratum of his hypnotic consciousness ; especially the fact that when he\nwas not en rapport with Mrs. Sidgwick and apparently not aware of\n& word she said, the table, with his hands on it, responded to her\nreadily, and this spontaneously, without any suggestion that it should\nbe so'having been made by Mr. Smith or ourselves.\nWith Miss B. thirty-seven trials were made in which she was\nguessing verbally and by table-tilting at the same time (excluding\nthose in which P. or T., or both, had their hands on the table also).\nHer verbal guesses were slightly more successful than those with the\ntable, but the success in both sets of guesses was very far below her\naverage. It seems probable that the condition of doing two things at\nonce was an unfavourable one, though she showed no external signs of\nbeing confused or in any way disturbed by it.\nII. Experiments in Transferring Ideas other than Numbers.\nTransference of Diagrams.\nExperiments were tried in transferring words, letters, playing cards,\nobjects and diagrams looked at by Mr. Smith, but there was no success\nworth quoting with any of our percipients except P., and with him only\nwith a set of diagrams which consisted of twenty-five shapes represent\ning familiar objects cut out in gold or silver paper and pasted on to\nblack cards. These were shuffled together and one drawn at random\nand hung on to a screen behind the percipient and between him and\nthe agent. P. was so much accustomed to seeing numbers that we\nthought it well to educate him to other impressions by telling him\ndefinitely in the first instance, on June 14th, 1890, what he was to see.\nMr. Smith therefore said to him : \" I am looking at a star\u2014a picture\nor diagram of a star\u2014you'll see it presently.\" P. : \"I don't see it.\"\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 553\n(After an interval :) \"Yes, I do; a golden star \" (right). Mr. Smith :\n\" How many points has it?\" P.: \"It keeps coming and going\u2014wait a\nminute \" ; presently he said\u2014\" Five \" (right).\nHe was then told to look out for another picture, no hint being\ngiven of what it was. A golden cock was drawn out of the pack and\nhe gradually made the following statements, without any hints being\ngiven : \" An eagle with wings spread out\u2014gold on a dark chocolate\nground.\" i The next one drawn was a golden basket ; as to this he had\nseveral shifting impressions, none right. In the course of the experi\nments, in which he sometimes took the part of agent for T. and Miss B.,.\nP. became familiar with all these diagrams, so that he knew what sort\nof thing to look out for and that they were limited in number. This\nenabled us to calculate the most probable number of successes by\nchance alone, namely 1 in 25.\nOn the second evening, July 2nd, 1890, he named correctly two\u2014a\njug and a basket\u2014out of five, Miss B., as well as Mr. Smith, looking at\nthe diagrams on this occasion.\nTwenty-five further trials of the same kind were made ; in fifteen of\nthese Mr. Smith alone was agent, and P. guessed five right ; in ten\nMr. Smith and T. together were agents, and P. guessed four right, but\none of the four was a second guess. Thus, out of a total of 30 trials,\nwhere the chance success would have been 1-2, 10 successes were\nactually obtained. The five successes obtained on July 3rd, when Mr.\nSmith alone was agent, may be quoted. After three failures Miss\nJohnson, who was sitting behind the screen with Mr. Smith, selected\nthe jug. Mrs. Sidgwick, who knew none of the subjects chosen, was the\nonly one who spoke to P., the others remaining silent after they knew\nwhat the subject was in each case. P. said : \" I saw a black thing com\ning up\u2014a sort of square thing.\" Mrs. Sidgwick : \" All right, that's the\nbackground.\" P.: \" Why, there it is, that jug I saw the other week.\" He-\nthen explained to Mrs. Sidgwick that the jug was \" put up\" (we generally\nused this expression in telling the percipients that an impression\nwould come to them) where he could see it much better than the-\nprevious pictures had been, and tried at her request to explain to her\nwhere it was. \" You see that hook on the wall there and the shadow it\ncasts,\" etc. His eyes were closed, so that any image he had of the room\nwas a visionary one, but he spoke and pointed as though clearly localis\ning the hook, etc. Mrs. Sidgwick could not discover that there was any\nreal object corresponding to the hook.\n5th Diagram. The Cock.\u2014P. said : \" Why, it's the bird, but it's not.\nfair putting it up like that\u2014it's not in the same place as the jug.\"\n6<\/t Diagram. The Slar.\u2014'P. had no impression.\nThe cock's wings were not spread out.\n\f.554 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\n7th Diagram. The Basket.\u2014P. said: \"I saw a handle. I do believe\nthat's that basket.\"\n8lh Diagram. The Cross.\u2014P. said : \" A cross.\"\n9th Diagram. The Arrow.\u2014P. said : \" The dart\u2014arrow, I mean.:'\nThis impression was slow in coming, and the next six experiments tried\non this evening were complete failures. It should be mentioned that in\nfour out of the five successful cases, the diagram had not been drawn at\nrandom, but selected by Miss Johnson\u2014in three cases on the ground\nthat P. had guessed it successfully on previous occasions. She merely\nnoted the fact herself at the time, without making any remark on it to\nanyone present, and it does not seem likely that the selection materially\naffected the amount of success, as three out of the last six diagrams on\nthis evening, none of which were guessed correctly, were selected in the\nsame way.\nWe had also a set of diagrams which were mere nameless arrange\nments of lines, but with these P. had very little success. He had\nlooked at all of them beforehand, and the impressions that came to\nhim seemed to be chiefly memories of what he had seen. The amount\nof coincidence with what the agent was concentrating his mind on at\nthe moment was only slightly above what chance would have given.\nTransference of Hallucinations.\nAn experiment somewhat like the transference of \"mental pictures\"\n\u2014to be described below\u2014sometimes succeeded. It consisted in making\none of our percipients by verbal suggestion see a hallucinatory picture\non a card, and then letting him show the card to another, who would\noccasionally, after looking at it for a few minutes, see a similar picture\nwithout verbal suggestion as to its subject. One of our earliest and most\nsuccessful experiments of this kind was described by Professor Sidgwick\nin a Presidential address. (See Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 434.) They were\ninteresting and striking, but evidentially of less value perhaps than the\nothers, as it was difficult to cany them out under strict conditions, and\nwe succeeded less well with them later.\nTransference of \" Mental Pictures.\" Introductory\u2014Conditions.\nWe spent more time and obtained more success in experiments in\nwhich the agent, Mr. Smith, was merely concentrating his mind on\na \" mental picture \" of some sort, without looking at any real re\npresentation. In some of the later trials, when the subject was a\nsimple one, he used occasionally to sketch it roughly on a small piece\nof paper, to help him to keep his attention fixed on it. But we did\nnot find that more success followed when this was done.\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 555\nWe generally, though not always, arranged that the person who was\nput en rapport with the percipient and carried on the conversation with\nhim during the course of each experiment, at the same time taking\nnotes of his remarks, should be entirely ignorant of the subject of the\npicture.\nThe subjects of the pictures were always chosen by one of us and\ncommunicated to Mr. Smith in writing, even when he was not in the\nsame room with the percipient. Mr. Smith did not speak to the perci\npient after he had been told the subject of a \" mental picture,\" until\nthe percipient's impression had been completely described and written\ndown, except on the occasions noted at the time, and mentioned below,\nand when he spoke it was generally at Mrs. Sidgwick's request. Nor,\nafter being told the subject of the picture, did he hypnotise the perci\npient, or awake him, or open his eyes, or put him into a deeper\nhypnotic state, or do anything involving contact, except in the few\ncases where we shall mention it.\nNature of the Percipients' Impressions.\nThe percipient was sometimes made to receive the impression as a\nfully externalised visual hallucination seen with open eyes ; usually as a\npicture on a blank white card on which he had been told that a picture\nwould appear, but occasionally in a crystal used in the same way. Mr.\nMyers' similar experiments with P. and T. in which a crystal was used\n.(described above, p. 459) should be considered in connection with ours.\nLatterly, the percipients were generally induced to see the pictures\nwhen hypnotised with closed eyes.\nDetails of Experiments.\nIn order that the reader may be enabled to form a fair estimate of\nthe amount of success obtained and to judge how much of it, if any,\nwas due to verbal suggestion, deliberately or unconsciously given, we\nthink it necessary to give full details of the experiments which we regard\nas successful, and we have added, for various reasons which will be\napparent, accounts of some failures. All the remarks quoted from\nany speaker were taken down verbatim at the time, the note-taker\ngenerally endeavouring to record at least all that was said by the agent\nand percipient, and in most cases the whole of the notes are repro\nduced. The result is that this part of our paper has run to great\nlength, and for convenience we prefix here a tabulated list of all the\nexperiments tried (except those with one percipient, Adams, who\nobtained no success), numbered and arranged in chronological order.\nThis can be skipped by the reader who does not wish to go into details.\nThe fourth column of the table describes the way in which the\n\f556 Jl\/rs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nimpressions came to the percipient, whether as hallucinations seen on a\ncard or in a crystal, or with closed eyes. The fifth column gives the\nposition of the agent in relation to the percipient. The words\n\" upstairs \" and \" downstairs\" refer to the two rooms, already described,\nat the Arch. The percipient was never downstairs except in the cases\nwhere it is mentioned. The word \" speaking \" in this column means\nthat the agent spoke after he knew what the subject of the picture\nwas to be. Whenever this word does not occur, it is to be understood\nthat he said nothing whatever after he knew the subject. In the\nfull report of the successful experiments that follows, his remarks, if\nany, are generally given as well as the percipient's. In only one\nexperiment (No. 38) was contact between agent and percipient\ndeliberately employed, and then without success. It occurred, how\never, in another case, No. 58, accidentally ; and in six cases, Nos. 9,\n12, 35, 51, 53, and 98, a change in the hypnotic condition of the perci\npient had to be brought about during the experiment which, with\nMr. Smith's methods of working, practically involves contact. The\nexperiments which we have counted as successes or partial successes\nare marked with an asterisk.\nLIST OF EXPERIMENTS IN TBANSFERRING MENTAL\nPICTURES.\nNo. Date. Subject of Mental\nPicture.

The subject, chosen by Mrs. Sidgwick, was a little boy with a\nball. Mr. Smith sat close to Miss B. but neither spoke to her nor\ntouched her. Miss B. presently said : \" A figure is coming\u2014a little\nboy.\" Mrs. Sidgwick asked what he had in his hand and Miss B.\nreplied : \" A round thing, a ball I suppose.\"\nNo. 2. For the next experiment Mr. Smith sat behind a screen.\nThe subject, a kitten in ajar, was again set by Mrs. Sidgwick. Miss B.\nsaid : \" Something like an old cat\u2014a cat\u2014I think it's a cat.\" Mrs.\nSidgwick : \" What is the cat doing 1 \" Miss B. (doubtfully) : \" Sitting\n' In this summary, eighteen experiments in which two percipients were trying at\nthe same time to get an impression of the \" mental pictures \" are counted each as two\nexperiments, one for each percipient, whereas in the preceding list each of them is\ncounted as only one experiment.\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 561\ndown.\" Mrs. Sidgwick : \" Is there anything else but a cat ? \" Miss B. :\n\" No, only scratches about.\"\nNo. 3. (Failure.) The next subject, set by Miss Johnson, a Aroah's\nArk and animals, failed. It was probably too complicated and indefi\nnite. Miss B. saw a small black lump which turned into a bee.\nThere was a curious development of her impressions in the next\ntwo cases.\nNo. 4. Subject, a Christy Minstrel ivith a banjo (chosen by Mrs.\nSidgwick who took the notes). Miss B. said : \" There's something long,\nsomething round in that one\u2014a little cage of some sort\u2014something\nthat looks like a cage ; yet there's something like a handle. A can !\noh, it's a can ! It's quite clear now.\" We then gave her a fresh card,\nand Mr. Smith moved round from behind the screen and sat close to\nher, still without speaking.\nNo. 5. The same subject (continued). Miss B. said : \" Something\nhere dark\u2014a hand.\" Mrs. Sidgwick : \" Is it a woman's hand or a man's1 \"\nMiss B. : \"A black hand.\" This seemed to be a partial success.\nMr. Smith then woke Miss B. up to ask her when she had to\ngo, but finding that there was still a little time to spare, rehypnotised\nher, and tried another subject.\nNo. 6. A sailing boat on the sea. Mr. Smith sat behind the screen.\nPresently Miss B. said : \" A man\u2014black.\u2014He's got something in his\nhand\u2014an instrument\u2014sort of guitar thing.\" As we had not spoken\nabout the Christy Minstrel and banjo, this tardy emergence of the\nidea when Mr. Smith was thinking of something else, and after\nawaking and rehypnotisation, was interesting.\nWe then changed Miss B.'s card and Mr. Smith continued to think\nof the sailing boat, but Miss B. only saw something like a bear, and\nwe changed her card again. Of course during these changes we told\nher nothing about the subject, nor whether it was changed, nor whether\nshe was right or wrong. Miss B. then said : \" Very funny thing \"\n(shaking her head) ; \" can't see it coming to any figure. There's a mess\n\u2014it doesn't come to any shape.\"\nNo. 7. At this point, Mrs. Sidgwick asked Mr. Smith to come from\nbehind the screen and sit near Miss B. Miss Johnson, who did not\nknow what the subject of the picture was, asked Miss B. whether it\nwas anything like an animal. Miss B. said : \" No\u2014got some prong sort\nof things\u2014something at the bottom like a little boat.\u2014What can\nthat be up in the air ?\u2014Cliffs I suppose\u2014cliffs in the air high up\u2014it's\njoining the boat\u2014oh, sails\u2014a sailing boat\u2014not cliffs\u2014sails.\" This\nwas not all uttered consecutively, but partly in answer to questions\nput by Miss Johnson, but as Miss Johnson was ignorant of the subject\nof the supposed picture, her questions could of course give no guidance.\n\f562 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nIt is obviously desirable in experiments of this sort that the talking,\nwhich is generally necessary in order to draw information out of the\npercipient, and also the noting down of what the percipient says, should\nif possible be done by a person ignorant of the idea to be transferred.\nBut it is not always easy to carry out these conditions so strictly as was\ndone in this case of the boat.\nIt will be observed that so far, except in the partial success of the cat\nseen for a kitten in a jar, Miss B. was only successful when Mr. Smith\nwas or had been quite close to her after the idea was in his mind, and\nin the case of the Christy Minstrel after the contact required for\nawaking and rehypnotisation.\nNo. 8. (Failure.) On July 10th we tried the same kind of experiment\nagain as soon as Miss B. arrived. Mrs. Sidgwick asked Mr. Smith to\ntry to make her see a picture of a soldier, but she had no impression\nat all either while Mr. Smith sat behind the screen or when he moved\nup close to her.\nOn November 10th, at the Arch, we tried the experiment with\nvariations, and on this occasion P. was percipient as well as Miss B.\nNo. 27. Miss B. sat with her eyes closed and her hand on a\nplanchette, hypnotised as usual. She was told that she would see\nsomething and that the planchette would write, but that she need not\ntrouble herself about the planchette. Mr. Smith sat opposite to her\nfor the first experiment, not in contact, but with no screen between\nthem. He did not speak after the subject\u2014a jug\u2014had been given\nhim in writing by Miss Johnson, who remained upstairs with Miss B.\nall the evening. Mrs. Sidgwick sat downstairs with P., who was look\ning at a blank caul on which he had been told, when hypnotised, that\na picture would appear. Mr. Smith was trying to transfer the subject\nto both of them. Miss B. soon said: \"Jug\u2014I see a jug,\" but with\nthe planchette nothing legible was written, and P. had no impression.\nNo. 28. Mr. Smith next sat downstairs, behind P., and did not\nspeak after the subject\u2014a clock\u2014had been given him by Mrs.\nSidgwick. Miss B. this time thought she saw a wine-glass, but P. saw\n\" something round like a watch,\" the hands pointing to ten minutes\npast 8. Mrs. Sidgwick : \"Is it a watch?\" P. said it was indistinct\u2014\n\" plainer now\u2014a ring at the top.\" It seemed as if the suggestion of\nthe watch had caused the ring to appear.\nNo. 29. The next subject, chosen by Mrs. Sidgwick, was a man\nand woman dancing, and Mr. Smith was again with P., sitting behind\nhim. The result was a failure as regards Miss B. She said she could see\nnothing, while her hand wrote with the planchette \" figure and animals.\"\nHut P., after long waiting, saw, as he said, \" A man and a girl there\u2014\na lady and gentleman.\u2014He's got his arm round her waist\u2014they're\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 5G3\nvalsing or dancing something or other \"; each point with an air of\ndiscovery\u2014the arm round the waist not at first suggesting the dancing.\nNo. 30. A cow being milked by a dairy-maid was the next subject\n.chosen by Mrs. Sidgwick, and Mr. Smith sat in the room with Miss B.,\nopposite to her as before. P. said : \" I fancy I see some coloured win\ndows as if it was going to be a church, but when I look again I can't\n.see them.\" He had no further impression apparently, but said, \"You\ncould easily fancy anything that came into your head.\" Miss B. said :\n*' There's an animal I can see, a big one too\u2014biggish looking\u2014got\nsome horns I think.\u2014It's a buffalo.\" Miss Johnson asked if she saw\nanything besides the buffalo and she said \" No.\" She also said that it\n.seemed to be standing up. In the meanwhile the planchette had\nwritten \" Cow.\"\nNo. 31. The next subject, chosen by Miss Johnson, was T. boxing?\nMr. Smith was informed upstairs what the subject was to be and then\n\u2022sat downstairs. Miss B. said : \" A man\u2014no, looks more like a child\u2014\nriding, I think ; child's doing something. I don't know\u2014figure of some\n-sort,\" etc. Her hand on the planchette meanwhile wrote illegibly, but\non Miss Johnson's request wrote again, and finally produced : \" Cat\ndrinking milk\u2014chair.\"\nP., downstairs, said : \" I thought I saw a dog's face coming, but it's\nyone away again.\u2014I see some faint outline of a dog there.\u2014I see a lot\nof different things.\u2014You see this corner \" (pointing it out to Mrs.\n.Sidgwick)\u2014\" a sort of tree there, all curled up.\u2014A portrait ? What I\ntook for the dog's face seems to be the background. I imagined it was\na photo of T. just now, but it can't be that.\" He recurred, however,\nto its being a portrait of T.\nThat P. succeeded when Miss B. failed and vice versd may have\nbeen due to the distance, or may have been due to Mr. Smith being\nunable to aim, as it were, at the distent percipient when the nearer one\nobtruded him or herself.\nNo. 33 has been counted as a success, but as P. was in this case\nthe principal agent, it hardly belongs to the same category as the\n;tbove. Before this experiment Mr. Smith had been trying to transfer\nthe same subject\u2014a big black dog\u2014to P., without success ; and Miss\nB., who came in in the middle, was also told to try to see the picture\nwithout, however, being hypnotised. They were then both hypnotised,\nitnd P. was told that he would be able to make Miss B. see what he\nthought of, and that he would be told in writing what this was to be\nHe was then awakened and the subject communicated to him, Mr.\n.Smith also knowing it. Miss B. said : \" It's an animal\u2014a dog.\"\ni T. had recently won a prize in a boxing match and had brought it to show to our\nparty one evening, so that the idea of T. boxing was a familiar one.\n\f564 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nMr. Smith: \"Yes, what colour?\" Miss B. : \" Dark\u2014looks like a\nblack and white clog.\" The image did not remain long. She could not\ntell what size it was and said it looked like a cat at first.\nOnly five more experiments of this kind, on three different days,\nwere made with Miss B. and no more success was obtained.\nExperiments with P.\nNo. 9. In the first attempt of this kind made with P. (on July 10th,\n1890), Mr. Smith at first sat behind a screen and Mrs. Sidgwick\ngave him a subject\u2014a pony. Miss Johnson was en rapport with\nP. who looked for the picture on a blank card. T. came in in the\nmiddle and was asked, in writing, to think of the same subject. P.\nsaid he saw a chair, and on being given a second card by Miss Johnson.\nthought he saw something like a rabbit, but complained that the\npicture was not clear\u2014it looked as if it was covered with tissue\npaper. Then Mr. Smith came round the screen and sat behind P.,\nwho did not appear to see him, but remarked \" This is very funny\u2014\nI don't think you want me to see anything.\" Mr. Smith then, at\na sign from Mrs. Sidgwick, made a few passes over him and told him\nthe picture would come in a minute, then said nothing more. P. next\nsaid : \"I see something coming\u2014it's a pony or a horse.\" Such an\nexperiment as this, though the success was tardy and not obtained\nunder the strictest conditions aimed at, yet often appeared to be useful\nas a means of encouraging both agent and percipient and inducing\nin them that expectation of future success which probably favours\nits occurrence.\nOn this evening, however, our attempts were chiefly in other\ndirections and we had no further opportunity of trying experiments of\nany kind with P. until August 25th, 1890, when we began at once with\nthe mental pictures. Three consecutive trials (Nos. 12, 13 and 14),\nthen failed ; in No. 1 2, the subject being an excursionist on a donkey,\nhe said he saw something like \"a horse, donkey or pony\u2014like a donkey\n\u2014head different,\" but in Nos. 13 and 14 he had no impressions what\never.\nThe next attempts\u2014five in number\u2014were made on November 9th,\n1890, in our lodgings. As a preliminary to each experiment, P. was\nhypnotised and told by Mr. Smith that he would see a picture, then\nhad his eyes opened and was given a blank card to look at. The\nsubjects of the pictures were chosen by Mrs. Sidgwick and written\ndown by her. In the case of the first two, the subject for the picture,\nwas shown in writing to Mr. Smith before his final remarks to P.\nabout looking for the picture to come on the card. In the case of the\nlast three, it was only shown to him after he had explained to P. what\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 565\nhe was to do, and he did not speak at all after he knew what the\nsubject was. He sat near P. but behind him in all cases. Miss John\nson, who was ignorant of the subjects, took notes of P.'s conversation\nand other remarks that were made during the course of each experi\nment. P. occasionally addressed Mrs. Sidgwick and she answered\nhim, being of course very careful to avoid giving any indications by\nher remarks.\nNo. 15. (Failure.) Subject : A fisherman with a barrow offish. P. :\n\" Something like two eyes there\u2014a face\u2014more like an owl's face than\nanything else\u2014can't see anything below\u2014only a face\u2014still I keep\nlooking.\" Mrs. Sidgwick said : \"Shut your eyes for a minute and then\nlook again.\" P. : \" Something like a rabbit now, when I opened my\neyes ;\u2014rather faint.\"\nNo. 16. Subject: A black kitten playing with a cork. P.: \"Some\nthing like a cat, it's a cat.\" Mrs. Sidgwick : \" What is it doing 1 \" P. :\n\"Something it's been feeding out of\u2014some milk, is it a saucer? Can't\nsee where its other paw is\u2014only see three paws.\"\nNo. 17. Subject : A sandwich man with advertisement of a play.\nP. said : \" Something like letter A\u2014stroke there, then there.\" Mrs.\nSidgwick : \"Well, perhaps it will become clearer.\" P. : \"Something\nlike a head on the top of it ; a V upside down\u2014two legs and then a\nhead.\u2014A man with two boards\u2014looks like a man that goes about the\nstreets with two boards. I can see a head at the top and the body and\nlegs between the boards. I couldn't see what was written on the\nboards, because the edges were turned towards me.\" Mr. Smith told\nus afterwards that he had pictured to himself the man and one board\nfacing him, thus not corresponding to the impression which P. had.\nNo. 18. Subject : A choir boy. i P. said : \" Edge of card's going a\ndark colour. Somebody dressed up in white, eh 1 Can see something all\nwhite ; edge all black, and like a figure in the middle. There's his hands\nup \" ( making a gesture to show the attitude) \" like a ghost or some\nthing\u2014you couldn't mistake it for anything but a ghost. It's not\ngetting any better, it's fading\u2014no, it's still there. It might frighten\nany one.\" He also made remarks about the difficulty of seeing a white\nfigure on a white card (the blank card he was looking at was white)\nwhich Mr. Smith afterwards said corresponded with his own ideas.\nNo. 19. Subject: A vase with flowers (Mr. Smith, still behind\nP., was looking at a blue flower pot in the window containing an\nindiarubber plant). P. said : \" I see something round, like a round\nring. I can see some straight things from the round thing. I think\nit's a glass\u2014it goes up. I'll tell you what it is ; it must \\ie a pot\u2014a\ni This was an idea extremely familiar to P., who had been a chorister and was still\nconnected with the choir of his church.\n\f5GG Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nflower-pot, you know, with things growing in it. I only guessed that,\nbecause you don't see things growing out of a glass.\u2014It's not clear at\nthe top yet. You see something going up and you can't see the top,\nbecause of the edge of the paper\u2014it's cut off. I don't wonder, because\nit's no good wondering what Mr. Smith does, he does such funny things.\nI should fancy it might be a geranium, but there's only sticks, so you\ncan't tell.\" Mrs. Sidgwick : \" What colour is the pot ? \" P. : \" Dark\ncolour, between terra-cotta and red\u2014dark red, you'd call it.'' Here\nthe somewhat confused impression, apparently corresponding to the\nstruggle of ideas in Mr. Smith's mind between what he was seeing and\nwhat he was trying to think of, is an interesting point.\nThe experiments of the next day, Nov. 10th, when Mr. Smith was\ntrying to transfer impressions to Miss B. and P. at the same time have\nalready been described above (see p.562).\nThe next trials with P. took place on Dec. 16th, 1890.\nNo. 34. (Failure.) Subject : A sailor smoking a pipe. Mr. Smith\nwas downstairs at the Arch with Mrs. Sidgwick, P. upstairs with Miss\nJohnson. P. thought he \" saw a boy eating an apple, only one boy.\"\nNo. 35. T. having come in, was hypnotised and set to look also\u2014at\n'another card\u2014for the next subject, a boy skating. Mr. Smith tried\nfirst from downstairs and then came upstairs, and sat by P., who\nseemed extremely dull and drowsy, so much so that he dropped his\ncard without knowing it. Mr. Smith had to rouse him by passes\nand talking and make him look at it. Then he said : \" I can see\na black smudge all the way along\u2014looks like some slippery\u2014as if he's\nslipping\u2014sliding or skating. Can't see any skates\u2014water frozen over\nin dark patches.\" T. meanwhile had an impression of a ship, sailing or\nsliding along.\nNo. 51. The next success\u2014on July 6th, 1891\u2014was not obtained\nwithout a certain amount of information being given to P. The subject\nwas the Babes in the Wood. To begin with, P. sat with closed eyes,\nbut when no impression came, Mr. Smith opened his eyes, without\nspeaking, and made him look for the picture on a card. After we had\nwaited a little while in vain, Mr. Smith said to him : \" Do you\nsee something like a straw hat ? \" P. assented to this and then\nbegan to puzzle out something more : \" A white apron, something dark\n\u2014a child. It can't be another child, unless it's a boy\u2014a boy and a\ngirl\u2014the boy to the right and the girl to the left. Little girl with\nwhite socks on, and shoes with straps.\" Mr. Smith asked : \" What are\nthey doing 1 Is it two children on a raft at sea ? \" P. : \" No, it's like\ntrees in the background\u2014a copse or something. Like a fairy story \u2014\nlike Babes in a Wood or something.\"\nNo. 53. On the next evening again, success was only obtained after\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 567\n\u2022contact and talking between agent and percipients, but any hint as to\nthe subject\u2014a cavalry soldier\u2014was avoided. P. first saw successively\na coach and a locomotive. Then T., who was also looking for the\npicture, saw \" a thing painted all red\u2014a large thing.\" After contact\nand talking with Mr. Smith, P. then saw \" a man, a volunteer\u2014only\nhead and shoulders\u2014a soldier on horseback.\"\nNo. 65. We made a good many attempts in which Mr. Smith was\nin a different room from P., but only obtained one success, on July\n9th, 1891. P.'s eyes were not opened and he was told that what\nhe would see would be a magic-lantern picture. (This idea was\nsuggested to us by Whybrew, who had imagined earlier in the same day\nthat he was seeing magic-lantern pictures when Mr. Smith was trying\nto transfer mental pictures to him.) Mr. Smith made him see the sheet\nand then went downstairs with Miss Johnson and was asked by her to\nthink of an eagle pursuing a sparrow. Mrs. Sidgwick, who remained\nupstairs with P., in a few minutes induced him to see a round disk of\nlight on the imaginary lantern sheet and then he saw in it \" something\nlike a bird \" (?)' which disappeared immediately. He went on looking\n(with closed eyes of course) and presently thought he saw \" something\nlike a bird\u2014something like an eagle.\" After a pause he said : \" I\nthought I saw a figure there\u2014I saw 5. The bird's gone. I see 5 again,\nnow it's gone. The bird came twice.\" Mr. Smith then came upstairs,\nand P. had another impression of an eagle. He was told that the\neagle was right and there was something else besides, no hint being\ngiven of what the other thing was. He then said that the first thing\nhe \" saw was a little bird\u2014a sparrow perhaps\u2014he could not say\u2014about\nthe size of a sparrow ; then that disappeared and he saw the eagle.\nHe had told Mrs. Sidgwick so at the time.\"\nNo. 86. (Failure.) After several failures on intervening days, the\nsame subject of the eagle pursuing a sparrow, was set again, on July\n14th, on the chance that the previous success might be a favourable\ninfluence in this case. This time Mr. Smith was in the room, but P.\nonly said : \" I think I can see a bird\u2014I forget the name of those\nbirds that fly over the water\u2014it's gone now.\" Mr. Smith said : \" You'll\nsee it again in a minute.\" P. went on : \" Now it's plainer\u2014a sea-gull.\"\nNo. 95. On July 16th the subject of a snake with itsforked tongue\nout was chosen by Miss Johnson, who sat behind a screen with Mr.\nSmith, in the same room with P. and Mrs. Sidgwick. P. said : \" I\nthought I saw something like one of those men with an ice-cream\nbarrow\u2014caught a glimpse of it \"\u2014then\u2014\" I just thought I could see\nsomething like a snake. I can see it now still\u2014something like a snake-\ni He spoke in a low voice, and Mrs. Sidgwick first thought he said \" child, \" but from\nhis subsequent conversation concluded that it was \" bird.\"\n\f568 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\ncharmer there playing with it\u2014isn't afraid of it a bit. I'm not going\nto say this is it yet, because I saw the ice-cream barrow just now. It\nseems a most silly thing to see a snake after an ice-cream barrow\u2014but\nthat went and this stays longer\u2014still there.\" The whole experiment\nlasted 10 minutes.\nThe last successes with P. were obtained on July 29th, 1891.\nDuring the first three trials Mr. Smith sat behind a screen with Miss.\nJohnson, in the same room with P.\nNo. 97. (Failure.) Subject : Policeman with cape on. P. appeared\nveiy sleepy and had no impression at all.\nNo. 98. Subject : A mouse in a mouse-trap. P. was in too deep a\ncondition to speak. He had to be roused and spoken to by Mr. Smith.\nMr. Smith behind the screen made a small pencil sketch of the subject.\nP. after some time said : \" I can see something\u2014some lines coming \"\n(pause). \" Still these lines and something like\u2014oh, I think I know\nwhat that's going to be. Is that meant for a mouse-trap ? \" Mrs.\nSidgwick asked : \" Any mouse ? \" P. said : \" I think it looks as if the\nmouse was trying to poke its nose through the bars. I don't think it's\nfancy.\" This was seen, not on a card, as usual, but with closed eyes.\nHis eyes were then opened by verbal suggestion from Mr. Smith and\nMrs. Sidgwick gave him a card, to see if he would see the mouse-trap\nmore clearly on it. But he saw nothing at all on the card, seemed in a\nstupid, drowsy condition and soon dropped it. Mr. Smith then\ntold him while hypnotised that when his eyes were opened he would\nsee the next picture develop on a card.\nNo. 99. (Failure.) Subject : A clock. Mr. Smith behind the screen.\nP. saw something like a bullock's head on his card. He was then\nrehypnotised.\nNo. 100. Subject : A spider in the middle of its tceb. Mr. Smith\nand Miss Johnson downstairs at first ; P. with Mrs. Sidgwick upstairs.\nMr. Smith drew the subject. P. had no impression. Mr. Smith came\nupstairs and sat behind the screen and talked to him, avoiding hints.\nAfter some time P. said : \" Now I can see something\u2014funny shape\u2014\ndon't know what it is either\u2014not quite round\u2014octagonal in some\nplaces\u2014lines across it\u2014more sides than eight\u2014some broken. If I\nwas to compare it with anything, it would be a spider's web ; but it\ncan't be that. There would never be a picture of a spider's web.\"\nExperiments toith T.\nNo. 39. T. had only two successes in these experiments. The first\noccurred on December 17th, 1890. T. having been hypnotised, had\nhis eyes opened and was given a blank card to look at. The subject\nwas a baby in a perambulalor and a nursemaid. Mr. Smith sat behind\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 569\nT. and said nothing. T. said : \" I see a big, tall thing, a thing they\nput children in\u2014babies' carriage\u2014perambulator. Yes, I think there's\na girl. Nothing in the perambulator. The girl's standing here \"\n(indicating a place on the card), \" not in the perambulator.\" But the\nsuccess in this case may be accidental, as in the last experiment of the\nday before T. saw a woman pushing a perambulator when he ought to\nhave seen a rose.\nNo. 40. (Failure.) The next subject was a man with a barrel-organ.\nMr. Smith was downstairs with Mrs. Sidgwick. T. had a rather vague\nimpression of a man \" caught in a fog \" and no more success was\nobtained that evening.\nNo. 44. On the next day he was told when hypnotised that he\nwould see visions in a black fluid, and was then wakened and given a\nsaucer of ink to look in. The first subject tried from downstairs\nfailed. The next subject set was Miss B., but as T. had no impression\nMr. Smith came up and asked if he had seen anything and told him to\ngive it another chance. After some time T. said : \" Oh, I can see\nnow. Is it a girl 1 Yes, I can see the face. Oh, yes ! it's a girl. I\ncan see now. A short girl rather\u2014standing.\" Being asked what\nshe was like, he said : \" Like Miss B. It is Miss B.\"\nHe had also one case of what was perhaps a deferred success, No.\n21, the subject being a black clog. T. saw \" Something square, like a\nbox.\" The next subject\u2014No. 22\u2014was the Eiffel Tower, and he then\nsaid : \" What is it? a dog or something\u2014a black one.\"\nExperiments with Whybrew.\nThe first two experiments of this kind with Whybrew, on July 8th,\n1891, were as follows.\nNo. 54. (Failure.) Subject : A goal-carriage, with one goat and two\nchildren in it. Mrs. Sidgwick, who was taking notes, gave this subject\nto Mr. Smith, who remained in the room. Whybrew said : \" Looks\nlike a horse there\u2014yes, there's a horse there. Why, that's a cart at\nits back\u2014a horse and cart.\" Mrs. Sidgwick asked : \" Anything in\nthe cart ? \" Whybrew replied : \" Is that a whip 1 and there's a man\nthere with the horse ;\u2014man, horse and cart\u2014nice little turn-out ! \"\nNo. 55. Subject : A ship in full sail. Set by Miss Johnson and\nunknown to Mrs. Sidgwick, who took the notes. Mr. Smith still in\nthe room. Whybrew said : \" I see something up in the air\u2014looks\nlike a mast. Why, there's a ship there\u2014looks something like a ship\n\u2014a nice ship. One or two heads\u2014dots\u2014they look like heads\u2014too\nfar away to see\u2014three masts Mrs. Sidgwick had drawn out some of\nthese details by questions. After seeing what the subject was, she\n-asked if the ship was in sail. He said he had not noticed.\n\f570 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nWhybrew was made to see these impressions with closed eyes\u2014not\non a card. On the next day, when told to look out for a picture, he\nremarked spontaneously that he supposed it was a magic-lantern\npicture that was coming. Mrs. Sidgwick assented to this idea and\ngot him gradually by verbal suggestion to see the white sheet, etc.,\nafter which he evolved for himself a tree (a totally wrong impression).\nFrom that time, the impressions he had generally came to him as magic-\nlantern pictures, which to a certain extent accounted to him satisfac\ntorily for their coming at all, though his curiosity was constantly\nexcited by his not being able to see any sign of the apparatus which\nproduced them.\nOn July 11th the first two trials failed. The first was made with\nMr. Smith downstairs and Whybrew upstairs ; in the second Mr. Smith\nsat by him and talked to him, but no clear impression resulted.\nNo. 76. The third subject was a little boy throwing up a red ball.\nMr. Smith sitting by Whybrew. The latter said : \" Looks like a shadow\nthere, like something round. That's a ball, ain't it ? \" Mr. Smith :\n\" Yes. \" Whybrew : \" Is that supposed to be a coloured ball ? \" Mr.\nSmith : \" Yes ; what colour 1 \" Whybrew : \" Why, red ; a red ball, that's\nwhat it is. Is there anything else 1 \" Mr. Smith :\" Yes.\" Whybrew.\n\" It looks something like a little boy\u2014a little boy with a ball. That's\nbetter than the others \" (meaning the previous pictures on this day). Mr.\nSmith : \" What's he doing with the ball ? \" Whybrew : \" I should imagine\nthat he's going to throw it.\" He proceeded to give details of the\npicture showing that it was clearly visualised.\nNo. 77. Subject : A man riding. Mr. Smith downstairs with Miss\nJohnson ; Whybrew, upstairs with Mrs. Sidgwick, said, after some\nremarks on the former pictures : \" There's another one\u2014I think it's like\nthe other two\u2014a puzzle [to see] if I can find the picture. I hope I'll\nbe able to see it properly. A kind of a square\u2014square shadow\u2014blowed\nif I can understand what it's meant for\u2014I don't know what to make\nout of that. I don't know if that's meant to be the lower part of a\npair of legs. Do you see a picture ? \" Mrs. Sidgwick : \" I see something.\"\nWhybrew : \" I see them two spots, but I don't know what to make of\nthem. If they're legs, the body ought to come.\u2014Don't seem to come\nany brighter, but there's those two things there, that look like a pair of\nlegs.\" Here Mr. Smith was asked to come upstairs and talk to him.\nHe told him the picture was coming up closer and that he had turned\nthe gas on to make it brighter. Whybrew : \" There's them pair of legs\nthere.\" Mr. Smith : \" Yes \" (doubtfully). Whybrew: \" Why, there's\nanother. I never see that other pair before. Why, it's a horse. I\nexpect it's like them penny pictures that you fold over. That horse\u2014\nthat's plain enough ; but what's that other thing?\" Mr. Smith : \" Yes,\nI told you there was something else.\" Whybrew : \" Why, I see what\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 571\nit is now\u2014it's supposed to be a man there, I expect.\" Mr. Smith r\n\" Yes.\" Whybrew : \" Riding him. But that ain't so good as the boy\nand the ball.\" Mrs. Sidgwick : \" How is the man dressed ? \" Whybrew r\n\" Ordinary.\"\nOn July 13th we tried making him see the pictures in a real crystal\ninstead of by means of an imaginary magic-lantern, and to facilitate\nmatters, he was first given a little education in crystal-vision. Mr.\nSmith hypnotised him and gave him a post-hypnotic suggestion to see\nin the crystal himself (Mr. Smith) reading. He then woke him, and\ngave him the crystal to look at. For some time he saw nothing and\nseemed sceptically amused by the idea that he ever would ; then,\nrather suddenly, his hypnotic manner came on. (There was a marked\ndifference between his behaviour when awake and when hypnotised.\nIn the latter condition he spoke always with a sort of slightly convulsive\nstuttering, and he was also much more unrestrained in his language and\nmanner.) He said he saw a man there. \"I think I've seen his face\nbefore. That's a gentleman that lives down the front \" (i.e., on the\nparade). \" Mr. Smith\u2014he's sitting down ; he's got a book there\u2014he's\nlooking in the book.\" Mr. Smith : \" Reading, probably 1\" Whybrew :\n\"Yes, or looking at the pictures.\" It was clear that he had fallen again\ninto the hypnotic trance as soon as the suggestion took effect. He was\nthen given another post-hypnotic suggestion to the effect that he would\nopen his eyes when Mrs. Sidgwick clapped her hands and would then\nsee another picture in the crystal.\nNo. 82. Miss Johnson then went downstairs with Mr. Smith and\ngave him the subject of an Italian woman with two little green birds in\na cage (a familiar object on the Brighton beach). After they had gone,\nMrs. Sidgwick clapped her hands and Whybrew opened his eyes,\nremaining however in a hypnotic state, and she gave him the crystal\nto look in. He saw nothingjtt first but some shading and lines which\nwere probably the lines of stitching, etc., of a smoking cap in which the\ncrystal was placed. Then Mr. Smith was asked to come up and speak\nto him. He saw no more for some time, but finally began : \" What's\nall them strokes down here t Is it the sea ? \" Mr. Smith : \" Not\nthe sea.\" Whybrew : \" Why, is that the ground 1 \" Mr. Smith : \" I\nshouldn't wonder.\" Whybrew : \" I can see the outsides now. Oh !\nthere looks like a head here. Why, it's a woman. She looks like a\nwoman that plays the organ. Don't you think so?\" Mr. Smith\n\" What's she doing now ? \" Whybrew : \" She looks like she's got her\nhand out\u2014something in her hand\u2014looks like seeds. Is she throwing\nanything on the ground ? Is there some sparrows there ? Looks\nsomething like one or two\u2014there's one bird there.\" Mr. Smith :\n\" What kind of bird is it ; what colour V Whybrew : \" I don't know\nwhat they call that. It's the shape of a sparrow. I can't see the colour\n\f572 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nof it.\" Mr. Smith : \" Where is that bird 1 \" Whybrew pointed out its\nposition in the crystal. Mr. Smith explained that he did not mean\nthat and asked, \"Is it on the ground?\" Whybrew: \"Not on the\nground, in a cage. There's the girl, she's looking at it.\" We believe\nthat he recovered his normal state at this point, but this is not recorded.\nAt any rate he was rehypnotised and awakened and he then said that\nhe had been looking in the crystal, but had seen nothing.\nOn July 15th, Whybrew having been hypnotised by Miss Charles-\nworth, another trial was made with Mr. Smith as agent. Mr. Smith\nhad to be introduced to Whybrew by Miss Charlesworth and put en\nrapport with him, just as we had to be when Mr. Smith hypnotised\nhim. Miss Charlesworth, though she had hypnotised him, failed as an\nagent.\nNo. 88. The subject given was a locomotive\u2014green in colour, with\nred stripes. Mr. Smith, however, did not notice the directions as to\ncolour and thought merely of the form. He sat by the side of and\nrather behind Whybrew, Mrs. Sidgwick holding up a newspaper as a\nscreen between them. He was sketching the subject, and occasionally\nmade remarks\u2014which Mrs. Sidgwick thought at the time carefully\nselected not to give hints\u2014in response to Whybrew's. The latter had\nno impression for some time, then said : \" Looks like something round\nthere\u2014looks like a wheel. You don't call that a picture, do you ?\nThere's another one the other side. There's something above them two\nwheels, but it don't touch the wheels\u2014a piece by itself. That's round,\nonly it's long\u2014like a pipe or something. Wonder what that's going to\nturn out. That looks like it's made of iron, it's black. That looks\nlike an engine.\u2014Here !\u2014and you've put the chimley. There was no\nman.\" The wheels in Mr. Smith's sketch, which we have preserved,\nwere done with little niggling touches, very faint. The sound of the\npencil, even if there was any audible sound, cannot possibly have\nsuggested the form.\nNo. 91. On July 16th, Mr. Smith himself hypnotised Whybrew, as\nusual. During the experiment he sat by him, but did not speak to him\nat all after he knew the subject\u2014a man with a harrow offiah\u2014given\nhim by Mrs. Sidgwick. Miss Johnson, not knowing what the subject\nwas, carried on the conversation with Whybrew. He said : \"It's the\nshape of a man. Yes, there's a man there. Don't know him. He looks\nlike a bloke that sells strawberries.\" Miss Johnson asked : \" Are there\nstrawberries there ? \" Whybrew : \" That looks like his barrow there.\nWhat's he selling of? I believe he's sold out. I can't see anything on\nhis barrow\u2014perhaps he's sold out. There ain't many\u2014a few round\nthings. I expect they're fruit. Are they cherries ? They look a bit\nred. Aren't they fish ? It don't look very much like fish. If they're\nfish, some of them hasn't got any heads on. Barrow is a bit fishified\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 573\n\u2014it has a tray on. What colour are those things on the barrow ? They\nlooked red, but now they look silvery.\" He was rather pleased with\nthis picture and asked afterwards if it was for sale.\nExperiments with Major.\nA few successes were obtained with Major, he being in all cases\nhypnotised and his eyes closed.\nNo. 58. In the first trial with him, on July 8th, 1891, Mr. Smith\nsat by him, in contact with his chair, and talked to him, telling him he\nwas to see a picture. The subject given was a mouse in a mouse-trap.\nRegarding himself as a man of culture and being generally anxious to\nexhibit this, Major asked if it was to be an old master or a modern\n\" pot-boiler.\" He was told the latter, and he then discoursed on \" pot\nboilers \" and how he knew all the subjects of them\u2014mentioning two or\nthree\u2014in a very contemptuous manner. He did not seem to see any\nthing, however, and appeared to be expecting to see an artist producing\na rapid sketch. Then, when told that the picture was actually there,\nhe suddenly exclaimed : \" Do you mean that deuced old trap with a\nmouse ? He must have been drawing for the rat vermin people.\"\nNo. 68. (Failure.) On July 10th we tried first with Mr. Smith\ndownstairs with Mrs. Sidgwick, Major remaining upstairs with Miss\nJohnson. The subject was a Christy Minstrel with a banjo. Major had\nfirst what appeared to be a rather vague and uncertain impression of a\nboat.\nNo. 69. Then Mr. Smith came up, but did not speak and Major\nwas told there was to be another picture. The subject, however, was\nnot really changed. Mr. Smith, saying nothing, sat behind and a little\non one side of him, sketching the subject on a block held up back to\nMajor, whose eyes were closed. Major then said : \" That's a man, isn't\nit ? Not a woman. Very dark complexioned\u2014thick lips\u2014negro ?\nNot an Englishman ; half-caste perhaps, not pure Saxon.\" Miss John\nson asked : \"Is he doing anything? Is there anything else?\" Major\nsaid : \" Has he got a hatchet or axe or something ? \" He got no clearer\nimpression, and even when in the end Mr. Smith spoke to him and told\nhim it was a banjo, said ho thought it looked more like an Indian club\nor tomahawk.\nNo. 70. For the next subject\u2014a coach with four horses\u2014Mr. Smith\nwas downstairs again with Mrs. Sidgwick and Major upstairs with\nMiss Johnson. He said : \" A horse, is it ? It looks to me something\nlike a horse.\" When Miss Johnson asked if there was anything else,\nhe thought he saw a man holding the horse's head, not so clear as the\nnegro (in the previous experiment) had been, but the horse was pretty\nclear, \"a good horse, a thoroughbred mare.\" Miss Johnson then went\ndownstairs and finding what the subject really was, came up and told\n2 Q\n\f574 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nMajor the horse was right, but there was something more to see. He\nsupposed it was a cart of some sort. Mr. Smith came upstairs and\ninquired what sort of cart. Major thought it was \" a light cart\u2014not\nagricultural\u2014not carrying a heavy weight.\"\nBesides the experiments quoted above, only three others were tried\nwith Major, all of which were failures. In all of these, Mr. Smith was\ndownstairs, Major being upstairs. Major's remarks during these latter\nexperiments generally gave us the impression that he had no clear\nvisualisations at all, but only very vague ones, on which his imagination\nwas not at all ready to work. On the other hand, our last percipient\n\u2014Adams\u2014seemed to have no difficulty in filling up the impressions\nthat he experienced with the most elaborate detail, drawn from his own\nimagination. So much was this the case, that the correct idea appeared,\nas it were, to have no chance of penetrating into his consciousness at all,\nand he was invariably unsuccessful in his guesses. It is possible that\nAdams was started on a wrong line\u2014that of deriving his impressions\nentirely from his imagination\u2014by the fact that we began these experi\nments with him with the agent in another room. His was the only case\nin which we did this.\nCondition of the Percipients.\nThe percipients were always hypnotised to begin with and, when\ntheir eyes were not opened, remained hypnotised throughout at least\nthe course of one experiment. When their eyes were opened, their\ncondition varied in different cases, and was not always easy to define.\nWe often attempted not to rouse them completely, but to let them\nremain in the hypnotic state if possible. P., however, seemed generally\nto wake completely as soon as his eyes were opened, so that his im\npressions might be regarded as post-hypnotic hallucinations. But some\ntimes he remained hypnotised, and was then apt to be heavy and drowsy\nand in a state of mental confusion. Thus, once he observed T., who\nhad come in while he was hypnotised, and seemed quite alarmed. He\nstared at him, saying : \" Is that T. ? He is altered ! \" This state did\nnot seem favourable to thought-transference in his case.\nIt was easy, on the other hand, to open Miss B.'s eyes without\nproducing any obvious change in her mental state, and her attention\nseemed to be then no more distracted by surrounding objects than\nwhen they were closed. It was in this condition that she saw almost\nall the hallucinatory pictures and numbers on cards in our experiments.\nT. was generally drowsy and rather stupid when hypnotised, and\nwhen his eyes were opened, without awaking him, and the sur\nrounding objects therefore not so much shut off from him as before,\nhis intellectual faculties seemed to be further diminished. This was\nstill more the case in some experiments with which we are not now con\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 575\ncerned when he was experiencing negative hallucinations induced by\nverbal suggestion. In fact he appeared then to be reduced almost\nto imbecility.\nWe tried varying the conditions in this way, because we thought it\npossible that a certain depth of drowsiness\u2014a certain stratum of the\nhypnotic consciousness\u2014might be the most favourable state for\nreceiving telepathic impressions. One day T., when in a specially deep\ncondition, certainly succeeded much better than usual, and we often\ntried to reproduce the same condition in him afterwards, but did not\nobtain the same success. Either we did not hit on the same stratum\nor that stratum was not really a favourable one.\nDevelopment of the Percipients' Impressions.\nImpressions of the form of the picture often came to the percipients\nin a piecemeal way, as the hallucinatory impressions of numbers some\ntimes did (see p. 554). This was markedly the case with Whybrew (see\nthe ship, No. 55 ; the little boy and ball, No. 76 ; the man riding,\nNo. 77 ; the Italian woman, No. 82 ; the locomotive, No. 88 ; the man\nwith a barrow of fish, No. 91). Miss B.'s impressions of the Christy\nMinstrel (Nos. 4, 5 and 6) and the sailing boat (No. 7) were other\nstriking instances, and with P. the same kind of development some\ntimes occurred (see the sandwich man, No. 17; the Babes in the Wood,\nNo. 51 ; the cavalry soldier, No. 53 ; the mouse-trap, No. 98.)\nIt seemed clear from this piecemeal development and from the\npercipient's frequent slowness in interpreting the form (e.g., P.'s man\nand woman dancing, No. 29, p. 562), that he became conscious of the\nform before he was conscious of the idea and that the correctness of his\napprehension of the idea depended partly on his acuteness in interpret\ning the often imperfectly developed form (e.g., Miss B.'s buffalo, No.\n30, p. 563). It was, however, equally clear that the precise form seen\ndepended on the percipient's imagination and not on the agent's ; see,\nfor instance, P.'s sandwich man, No. 17, p. 565, and the numbers seen\non cards and traced for us (p. 543), which were generally quite different\nin form from those Mr. Smith were looking at. It appeared further that\nthe interpretation was liable to react on the form, as in the case of the\nchoirboy, No. 18, p. 565, whose ghostly attitude was apparently a conse\nquence of the supposition that he was a ghost, and of the watch, No. 28,\np. 562, which acquired a ring after it had been identified as a watch.\nIf we compare the development in our thought-transference experi\nments with that in posthypnotic pictures or crystal-visions\u2014as when\nWhybrew was made to see Mr. Smith (p. 571), and in Mr. Myers'\ninteresting experiments with P. and T. (see present number of Proceed\nings, p. 459) the conclusion is irresistible that after the first introduc\ntion into the percipient's mind of the idea which externalises itself in\n2 q 2\n\f576 Mrs. H. &iilywick ami Miss Alice Johnson.\nthe hallucination, the process in the case of the mentally and of the\nverbally suggested ideas is identical. Take, for instance, the case of the\nscene of Banquo's ghost. Mr. Myers tells the hypnotised P. the story\nfrom Macbeth accompanying it with a suggestion that he will see it in\nthe glass. P., awakened, has no recollection of this idea, but presently\nhe sees it in the glass of water, clothed in a form due to his own\nimagination, and interprets what he sees according to his ordinary\nideas and without any direct or conscious reference to the idea implanted\nin his mind by Mr. Myers. Rehypnotised, P. could probably have\nrepeated the story of Banquo and would have known that Mr. Myers\nhad told it to him, though he might have forgotten seeing it in the\nglass. It would be very interesting if by any artifice we could recall\nthat stratum of consciousness which in our experiments received the\npurely mental suggestion subsequently developed into the picture seen.\nInfluence of Memory on Hallucinations.\nAn analysis of the guesses made by the percipients in these experi\nments shows that their impressions were generally reproductions of\nfamiliar objects or ideas, while there are some slight indications of what\nis apparently a tendency of hallucinations that have once occurred\u2014no\nmatter in what way they may have been induced\u2014-to recur in future\nhypnoses.\nThe earlier experiments with diagrams seemed to illustrate the diffi\nculty of producing telepathically in P.'s mind an impression of an\nunfamiliar idea. As mentioned above, two sets of diagrams were used,\n(a) shapes representing familiar objects cut out in gold or silver paper,\nand (b) nameless arrangements of lines, drawn in black on white paper.\nRoughly speaking, the successes obtained with (a) occurred after P.\nhad seen all the diagrams in a normal state, so that the ideas were by\nthat time ready-made in his mind. With (b), the nearest approach\nto a success before he had seen the diagrams was the guess of some\nthing like an H for one which distantly resembled that letter. After\nhe had looked through them all in a normal condition, impressions of a\nvery similar kind began to occur to him when hypnotised and told to\nlook out for diagrams of that sort. In twelve trials (in which, being\nhypnotised, his eyes were opened and he traced the impressions\nthat came to him as hallucinations on a sheet of paper,) eight of\nthe ten different figures he drew had some clear resemblance to\nsome of the (b) diagrams \u2014three of them being successful or nearly\nsuccessful guesses\u2014and one represented an (a) diagram. While\nhypnotised he said in answer to questions that he could not\nremember having ever seen any such things before, except the\n(a) diagram (which as a matter of fact had been successfully guessed\nby him in previous hypnoses) But when awakened and asked to\n\fExperiments in Thought-TranHference. 577\ndraw as many of the (6) diagrams as he could from memory, he\ndrew nine, all but one of which he had given as reproductions in\nthe course of the evening. His drawings represented the originals\nwith very much the same degree of accuracy that his hallucinatory\nimpressions did. It seemed clear therefore that the latter depended\nentirely on his memory.\nIt appeared to us also conducive to success, that the agent should\nbe familiar with the idea which he attempted to transfer. Mr. Smith\ntried several times to transfer real pictures from books, but with no\nsuccess. Either no impression at all, or a totally wrong one was\nproduced.\nIII. Production of Local Anaesthesia and Rigidity by Mental\nSuggestion.\nIntroduction and General Considerations.\nThe production of local anesthesia and rigidity is of course a\nphenomenon that has often been observed and described in connection\nwith experiments in hypnotism, and is familiar to all hypnotic operators,\nas the result of a definite verbal suggestion ; and it can also be pro\nduced in some subjects by self-suggestion (see Proceedings, Vol. V., pp.\n280-282). The physiological action involved is a question of great\ntheoretical interest, but our experiments were not directed towards\nadding to the present state of knowledge with regard to this.\nThey were carried out under conditions which, as we believe, precluded\nany knowledge on the part of the subject as to which of his fingers\nwas to be operated on, and thus, in one important respect at least,\nthey differed essentially from the ordinary experiments referred to.\nThe familiar effects were produced by unfamiliar\u2014or not generally\nrecognised\u2014means, and it is with the means, and not with the effects,\nthat we are here chiefly concerned.\nReaders of the Proceedings will be aware that the late Mr. Gurney\nwas the first to carry out a series of experiments of this kind, and\nit will be seen that ours are only a slight extension of his. He\ndescribed the conditions under which his later experiments of this\nkind were performed in Proceedings, Vol. V., pp. 14-17. The person to\nbe operated on passed his hands through a screen extending far enough\nin all directions to conceal them and Mr. Smith from his view, and\nspread out his ten fingers on a table in front of him. A finger having\nbeen selected by Mr. Gurney without the knowledge of the subject,\nMr. Smith held his hand above it, willing that it should be affected\nin the usual way\u2014that is, become rigid and insensitive,\u2014and this with\na suitable subject almost always occurred to that finger, and that\nlinger alone. Generally, Mr. Gurney himself held his hand at the\n\f57S Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nsame time over another finger, imitating Mr. Smith's action, but usually\nwithout any effect being produced in this other finger. The subject\nwas in a normal condition throughout, and frequently talked or read\naloud while the experiment was in progress, no effort or attention\non his part being apparently necessary.\nMr. Gurney varied the conditions in different ways. He tried a few\nexperiments with small screens of paper or tin over the fingers to be\noperated on (Proceedings, Vol. 'V., p. 16). Success was impeded by\nthese devices, but not apparently prevented, but the trials were far too\nfew to base any conclusions upon. We believe that he tried and failed\nwith a screen over the whole of the hand, but this is not recorded.\nWith a paper screen over the whole hand, but having a narrow\nopening through which the finger to be operated on could be seen,\nfive trials failed and one succeeded. More important were the negative\nresults obtained either when Mr. Smith held his hand above the\nfinger and willed that no effect should be produced (Proceedings, Vol.\nV., p. 16), or when he willed the effect to be produced without approxi\nmating his hand to that of the subject (Proceedings, Vol. II., p. 20-1).\nMr. Gurney discusses the possible explanation of his results in the\nsame number of the Proceedings (Vol. V., pp. 254-259). He assumes\nthat the conditions adopted secure\u2014as they are designed to secure\u2014-\nthat no indications as to which finger is to be operated on should\nunintentionally reach the subject through the eye, or the ear, or by\ntouch. There remain then three hypotheses :\u2014(\u00ab) that this knowledge\nmay reach his brain by means of a delicate perception\u2014conscious or\nunconscious \u2014of temperature or air-currents, caused by the proximity\nof Mr. Smith's fingers ; (6) that it may be conveyed from Mr. Smith's\nmind to that of the subject by thought-transference ; and (r) that some\ndirect physical influence in which the ordinary channels of sense are\nnot concerned is exercised through Mr. Smith's hand on that of the\nsubject.'\nMr. Gurney considered that the ineffectiveness of Mr. Smith's hand\nunless his will was engaged at the same time seemed alone fatal to\nhypothesis (\u00ab,), which was also rendered almost untenable by the\ndifficulty of supposing that the delicate perception assumed could have\ni Mr. Gurney explains this hypothesis at greaterlength on pp. 257-259 Vol. V. He\nthinks that if this specific influence exists, as a property of living tissue, there can be\nno doubt that it depends on the brain of the operator ; since his attention and will to\nproduce the effect are indispensable and the same proximity of his hand which pro\nduces the effect also removes it\u2014the only change of condition being in his intention.\nIt is clear, however, that the nervous condition of the operator is not simply repro\nduced in the subject\u2014the hand operated on assuming quite a different condition\nfrom that of the hand that operates. Therefore, \" though finding its nearest analogue\nin induced electric currents and though best, perhaps, described as nervous induction,\n[the influence] is essentially vital and sui gencrit.\"\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 579\nbeen delicate enough to make it possible to distinguish Mr. Smith's\nhand from Mr. Gurney's held similarly over another finger at the\nsame time. Hypothesis (6), Mr. Gurney says, \"seems excluded by\nthe fact that the physical proximity of Mr. Smith's hand (no less\nthan his concentration of will on the desired result) proves to be\na necessary condition,\" and he concludes that the balance of probability\nis greatly in favour of hypothesis (c)\u2014a direct physical influence,\nexercised through Mr. Smith's hand, in which the ordinary channels\nof sense are not concerned.\nThis brief introduction seemed necessary in order to explain the\nstate of the question and the bearing of our own experiments on it.\nThese, as will be seen, still further confirm Mr. Gurney's view as to the\nuntenableness of his hypothesis (a), because we have succeeded in\nobtaining the result with a thick sheet of glass between Mr. Smith's\nfingers and the subject's. They also exclude hypothesis (c) and\nremove Mr. Gurney's main objection to hypothesis (6), (thought-trans\nference), because we have succeeded when Mr. Smith did not hold his\nhand over the subject's at all, but merely stood with folded arms\nlooking at the finger to be affected. We therefore believe that the\ntrue explanation of the results is thought-transference or mental\nsuggestion, received in some unconscious or \"subliminal\" manner by\nthe subject's mind and acting on his organism in the same way that\nan ordinaiy verbal suggestion may act. The process would thus be\nanalogous to that supposed by Mr. Gurney to occur hi hypnotisation\nat a distance.\nBefore proceeding to a detailed description of our own experiments,\nwe may remark that even taking Mr. Gurney's alone, the balance\nof probability seems to us to be rather on the side of thought-trans\nference than of a direct physical influence. His contrary opinion\nappears to us to rely too much on negative evidence, the force of\nwhich it is easy to over-estimate. In his unsuccessful experiments\nwhere willing without approaching the hand was used, the only\nobserved difference in conditions was the intentional withholding of Mr.\nSmith's hand ; but this difference may easily not have been the whole\nchange actually produced in the conditions, and therefore may not have\nbeen the cause of the 7um-oecurrencc of the phenomena under obser\nvation. Our experiments show, in fact, that it was not the cause.i\nBut we also think some of Mr. Gurney's positive results hard to\ninterpret on any hypothesis of a physical influence acting immediately-\non the subject's nerves, and not through his brain by means of sugges-\ni Similarly in our experiments in the transference of numbers, it is clear from our\nlater experiments that though we failed in 1889 when agent and percipient were in\ndifferent rooms, we should have been wrong in deducing that it was necessary to\nsuccess that they should be in the same room.\n\f580 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\ntion. We refer especially to the fact that occasionally the wrong\nfinger was affected instead of, or as well as, the right one. For instance,\nin Mr. Gurney's experiments with little paper screens already\nmentioned, two fingers, the selected one and another, were protected\nby them, and in the first experiment lxith these fingers became stiff\nand insensitive. Now it is easy to see how this might happen if the\nresult were due to \" suggestion \"\u2014that is, to an impulse communicated\nto the percipient's brain which set the machinery to work to produce\nthe nervous effect\u2014for the suggestion can easily be conceived to go\nwrong. If it was self-suggestion, due to the perception of the little\nscreens through the senses, it might naturally affect both fingers alike ;\nand if it was mental suggestion through the action of the operator's\nmind on that of the subject, it is easy to suppose that Mr. Smith's\nattention was equally directed to both the marked fingers, though his\nhand only pointed to one. But it is hard to see how any specific\ninfluence from Mr. Smith's hand could affect the finger he was and the\nfinger he was not pointing at, without affecting also the intervening\nones.\nDetails of the Experiments.\nFor our own experiments we adopted the same arrangements as\nMr. Gurney. The subject, who was always in a normal condition at\nthe time of the experiments, sat with his hands passed through holes\nin a screen which extended sufficiently above and on each side of him to\nprevent his seeing the operator or his own hands. The hands were\nspread out on a table and the finger to be operated on was silently\nindicated to Mr. Smith behind the screen by one of ourselves, either\nby signs or in writing. Mr. Smith generally said nothing while an\nexperiment was going on, and he remained behind the screen until the\ntesting was finished. The subject was frequently engaged by one of us\nin conversation on topics outside the matter in hand during the process\nof making the finger insensitive, but sometimes we encouraged him to\nattend to his own sensations with results which will be described\nbelow. When we believed the insensitiveness to have been produced,\nwe ascertained, without moving the screen, which finger it was in by\ntouching the fingers with the point of a pencil or . some other con\nvenient instrument, taking care to attack them in varying orders,\nsometimes beginning with the selected finger and sometimes taking\nit later in the series, so that no indication as to which finger we\nexpected to find affected might be given by the order of testing.\nOccasionally the testing was done by one of us who was ignorant\nof which finger had been selected. Rigidity was ascertained by tell\ning the subject to close his hands, when the affected finger remained\nextended. We often tried this before testing for insensitiveness,\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 581\nbecause it was free from the objection that in testing we might possibly\nourselves indicate the finger. In some experiments we attempted\nto ascertain roughly the degree of insensitiveness by means of a small\ninduction coil. To this we shall recur later when we discuss the\nnature of the effect produced.\nOur experiments may be divided into six heads, according to the\nposition and procedure of Mr. Smith.\n(a) First we have those in which Mr. Smith's hand was held above\nthe selected finger, with no intervening screen, his fingers pointing\ndownwards towards it, and their tips at distances varying up to about\nfour inches from it. This position we shall in future describe as\n\"pointing.\" Under these conditions, we had 13 trials with P., and a\nfew with Miss B., in 1890, all of which succeeded, except the first with\nP., when no effect was produced on any finger. As this was the first\nexperiment of the whole series and made after a long interval during\nwhich Mr. Smith had not been trying anything of the kind, the\nfailure is not surprising. In 1892, out of 12 trials made with\npointing, 5 may perhaps be counted as failures. In one of these\nfailures a wrong finger was affected, the one, namely, which Mr. Smith\nhad been vainly trying to affect without pointing in the experiment\nimmediately preceding. It is possible, of course, that this may have\nbeen a deferred effect, but it was the only case of the kind, so that we\nhave not sufficient ground for forming a conclusion about it. In\nthe other 4 failures, after prolonged effort some slight effect appeared\nto be produced, and in the right finger, but too little or too transiently\nfor us to regard the result as a success. In one of these cases (which\nall occurred on two successive days\u2014the two last and least successful\ndays of our experiments) a slight effect was produced in the selected\nfinger, which disappeared after further operation.\nThis is perhaps the best place to remark that there is a certain\nindefiniteness in our use of the word \" failure,\" owing to our not\nprescribing any limit of time during which the effect was to occur.\nThe time required varied, but to attempt to ascertain with any\nexactness what it was would have interfered somewhat with the main\nobject of our experiments, and our usual practice was to allow what\nwas generally ample time\u2014three or four minutes\u2014before testing.i\nIf on testing no effect had been produced, we sometimes counted the\nexperiment a failure and proceeded to a fresh one, at other times\ni The longest time recorded as having elapsed before the anesthesia was observed\nin any successful experiment was 14 minutes from the beginning of the attempt.\nThis was a case where Mr. Smith tried for a few minutes from a distance, then came\nnearer and finally had recourse to pointing. The shortest time recorded was | minute,\nand in this case the recovery was proportionately rapid.\n\f5S2 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nwe continued it ; in either case endeavouring to suggest to the subject\nthat we were satisfied and that a new experiment was beginning.\n(6) In the second division of our experiments come those in which\na glass screen was placed over the subject's hands. For the first four\nof these, we used a framed window pane which happened to be handy.\nThen we obtained and used a sheet of 32 oz. glass, measuring 22 by 10\ninches and jl inch in thickness. It was supported on two large books\nplaced beyond the subject's hands on each side. In this position the\nupper surface of the glass was 2\\ inches above the surface of the table,\nso that there was ample room for the hands to rest underneath the glass\nwithout touching it. Mr. Smith held his hand in the usual position\nover the selected finger, above and not touching the glass. Under\nthese conditions, we tried 21 experiments with P., of which 18 were\nsuccessful, and 6 with Miss 13., all successful. In the case of the 3\nfailures with P., no effect was produced on any finger. In one\nsuccessful case, the time taken was long, and we interrupted the\nexperiment by premature testing in the way explained above.\n(c) This division includes those experiments in which Mr. Smith did\nnot approximate his hand to that of the subject at all, but merely\nlooked at the selected finger from some place in the same room as the\nsubject, but out of his sight. The distances between him and the\nsubject varied from about 21 to about 12 feet. Under these con\nditions we tried 37 experiments with P., 18 in 1890, of which 12 were\nsuccessful, but 2 of these only partially so, and 19 in 1892 of which 9\nwere successful. The proportion of success was, it thus appears, much\nless than under the previously described conditions, but still much\nbeyond what chance would produce. (The most probable number of\nsuccesses by chance alone was of course 1 in 10.) Of the 6 failures in\n1890, one was a case in which Mr. Smith made a mistake as to which\nfinger wc had selected, but succeeded with the one he thought of. In\nanother case the left thumb instead of the right thumb became insensi\ntive. In the other 1 cases no finger at all was affected. Of the 10 failures\nin 1892, no effect w;is produced in 4 cases ; in another the right (namely,\nthe little) finger of the wrong hand became insensitive1 ; in 4 cases\nan adjoining finger was affected\u2014once only slightly\u2014instead of that\nselected, and in the remaining case a finger distant from the selected\none was slightly affected.\n(rj) This division includes G experiments, all in 1892, in which\nMr. Smith stood in another room, looking through two doorways at P.'s\nhands from a distance of 22 to 25 feet. In order to see the finger\n' It happened on another occasion under these conditions that the right little finger\nwas slightly affected when the left little finger, which had been selected, was so in a\nmore decided manner.\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 583\nbetter, he looked through an opera glass. Three of these experiments\nsucceeded and three failed,\u2014in each of the three failures a wrong\nfinger being affected. One of these was the right (namely, the little)\nfinger of the wrong hand.\n(e) In this division we have the cases when Mr. Smith was in\na different room from P. with a closed door preventing his seeing P.'s\nhands. The number of trials made was 14, and 12 of them were\ncomplete failures, only partial success being obtained in the other two.\nIn 4 cases of failure, no effect was produced and in the other 8 a wrong\nfinger was more or less decidedly affected.\nIt is perhaps significant that in so large a proportion of failures,\nunder the more difficult conditions (d) and (e), a wrong finger should\nhave been affected instead of no effect being produced. Perhaps\nthe weakness of the impulse from Mr. Smith's mind prevented P.'s.\n\" subliminal consciousness \" from distinguishing it from slight sugges\ntions from other sources. It is noticeable also that, in 1892, the\ntendency for a wrong finger to be affected rather than no finger at all\nseems to have been much greater than in 1890. This may have been\nbecause P. was then altogether less susceptible to thought-transference,\nfor the experiments on the fingers succeeded less well even under the\neasiest conditions, and transference of numbers, which we also tried\nwith him at this time, practically failed altogether ; or the effect of ex\nperiments under unfavourable conditions may have been to educate him\nto follow any casual suggestion. We do not think that there is sufficient\nground as yet for adopting either of these explanations, except provi\nsionally, but in our present ignorance of the way in which thought-\ntransference operates, almost any possible clue is worth considering.\n(\/) This division consists of 4 experiments of a different kind\u2014those\nin which Mr. Smith's hand was approximated to the subject's and point\ning at a selected finger, but in which he willed to produce no effect-\nThese all had the negative result intended.\nAVe now give a list of all the experiments with P. in chronological\norder. The third column of the list describes the position and\naction of Mr. Smith in relation to the subject, and each experiment is\nmarked (a) or (6), etc., according to which of the six heads already\nmentioned it belongs to. The fourth column gives the finger selected\nto be operated on ; R stands for the right and L for the left hand, and\nthe fingers are numbered in order, the thumb being counted as the\nfirst. The fifth column gives the finger affected, if any, and describes\nthe effect produced. It is to be understood that the effect described\nwas found the first time the finger was tested, whenever stages of\ntesting are not mentioned.\n\f\u2022584 Mrs. H.

Sidgvnck and Miss Alice Johnson.\nMeans used to test the Anossthesia.\nWe may now turn to the discussion of the effect produced on the\nfinger.\nThe first question is as to the reality of the alleged anesthesia.'\nMr. Gurney had tested this so thoroughly that\u2014apart from our confi\ndence in the assertions of our subjects\u2014we felt ourselves absolved from\napplying the somewhat unpleasant methods which would have been\nnecessary for complete proof of it, and some of which would have\ninterfered with such frequent and continuous experimenting as ours.\nOnly once was the finger operated on pricked so as to draw blood, and\nthen apparently without the slightest consciousness on the part of the\nsubject.\nTwo different methods of testing for anesthesia were employed.\nOne was touching all the fingers at various points in varying order\nmany times in succession, the subject being asked to say whenever\nhe felt the touches. It would, no doubt, have been perfectly easy\nfor him, had he wished to do so, to simulate anesthesia in a particular\nfinger by simply saying nothing whenever that finger was touched.\nHis only difficulty would have been to discriminate the touches on it\nrapidly enough not to respond, his hands being hidden from him.\nThe second test used was a current from a small induction coil,\nwhich we could vary in intensity. This we applied through two\nwire terminals, which were placed at a short distance apart on\nthe finger and produced a sensation resembling a prick. We could\nonly try the electric current freely on all the fingers when it was\nweak, but as soon as any finger appeared insensitive to it, we pro\nceeded to test the degree of anaesthesia by gradually increasing the\nstrength of the current. The strongest current that the apparatus\ncould give would have produced decided pain in any finger in a normal\ncondition. The sensibility of different persons to pain of this kind\nvaries a good deal, but we had tried it roughly with all the party, so\nthat we had an approximate notion of the effect produced by different\nstrengths of the current. It could not be said that the pain produced\nby the strongest current was unendurable, but it would certainly have\nrequired a considerable exercise of self-control not to betray it in any\nway. It must be remembered too that, apart from their probably not\nbeing aware of the limits of the machine, the subjects were without\nany safeguard that we might not apply the severest tests of any\nother kind at any moment,\ni It may be worth while to remind our readers that even on the supposition that\nthe annesthesia was simulated, it would still have to he explained how it came to be\nsimulated in the finger selected by us rather than in any other, and that this question\nwas of more immediate interest to us than the question uf the reality of the\namesthcsia.\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 5SD\nBut perhaps the strongest evidence of the reality of the effect was\nthe excellent and sustained acting that would have been required for\nsimulation. We do not think that any impartial observer, who was as\nwell acquainted with the subjects as we were and who had carefully\nwatched all the experiments and talked to the subjects while they were\ngoing on, would believe that the ansesthesia was simulated.\nThe uniformity in the sequence of effects described below affords\nfurther strong evidence in favour of the genuineness of the experiments,\nsince the subjects were quite unaware that we were making these\nobservations, such points never being discussed in their presence, even\nwhen they were hypnotised.\nDegree of Anesthesia and Means usedfor Restoring Sensibility.\nAssuming, then, that the experiments were genuine in the sense that\nthe alleged effects actually took place, we may proceed to consider in\nmore detail the nature of these effects.\nThe anesthesia was sometimes not complete, the finger being sensi\ntive to strong shocks, while retaining its insensibility to weak stimuli.\nThe transition from not feeling to feeling the current seemed strangely\nsudden as the strength was increased, as we noted in the first two\nexperiments (Nos. 27 and 29) in which the electric test was tried. In\nNo. 34 the strongest current that the apparatus could give was felt only\nafter it had been applied to the finger for some time. In 6 cases with\nP. it was observed that the normal sensibility seemed to be suddenly and\ncompletely restored after prolonged application of the electric current,\nperhaps when applied at particular points on the finger. Thus, in two\ncases, it seemed that the shock applied on the right side of the finger\nbrought the sensibility back.\nGenerally Mr. Smith restored the finger to its normal condition by\nmaking upward passes with contact over it. He made six attempts,\nlate in the series, to restore P.'s fingers by a mere effort of will. He\nremarked to us at first that he did not feel as if he knew how\nto direct his mind towards the required result, and the first attempt\nfailed. In the second trial the sensibility only, and not the power of\nmovement, returned ; the third failed again ; the fourth succeeded,\nwhile in the fifth and sixth the sensibility was restored completely and\nthe flexibility partially. With Miss B. also a few attempts were made\non one day to produce recovery by an effort of will on Mr. Smith's\npart, without his stroking the finger, and without taking off the glass\nscreen which covered the hands. In the first trial, some effect in\nrestoring the sensitiveness seemed to be produced ; the second trial\nfailed. In the third, the hands being still under the glass screen and\nthe finger having been affected when Mr. Smith was looking at it,\n2 K\n\f590 Mrs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nwithout pointing, it was restored under the same conditions, hut there\nwas some doubt as to whether it did not simply recover of itself, as the\nrecovery took a long time.\nSpontaneous recovery took place in 5 cases (in one of them, only\nafter the electric test had been applied, though not at the time of its\napplication, and in three when only a very slight effect had been pro\nduced). It seems most likely that this spontaneous recovery would\nhave taken place always if the finger had been left to itself for a suffi\ncient length of time, and it may have been merely this that occurred\nwhen Mr. Smith was trying to restore the finger by an act of will. It\nseemed to us at the time, however, that his willing was effective and\nthat he could have succeeded with greater certainty and completeness\nif he had tried oftener, or if we had spent more time on each attempt.\nBut this was not worth while, because the experiments could never\nhave been very conclusive on this point, and the upward strokings were\na rapid and convenient means of restoring the fingers to their normal\nstate.\nSequence of Effects.\nAn interesting point observed was that the loss of sensibility\nseemed to spread from the lower part of the finger upwards, and when\nthe effect was slight, the tip of the finger only was affected. We have\nrecorded 14 cases in which either the lower part only\u2014or the lower\npart first\u2014became insensitive, or more insensitive than the upper.\nThe only case observed in which this rule did not appear to hold good\nwas one (No. 55) in which\u2014after an attempt longer than usual, viz.,\nfrom 5 to 10 minutes\u2014-the only part of the selected finger (the right\nthumb) that became insensitive was the inner side of the proximal\njoint. Another possible exception to the rule was an experiment with\nMiss B., in which the part selected to be made anoesthetic was a spot in\nthe middle of the back of the left hand. Here the ansesthesia extended\nboth above and below the spot, over the metacarpal and proximal joints\nof the middle finger.\nRecovery seemed to proceed in the opposite direction, the sensibility\nspreading downwards towards the tip of the finger. It was only\npossible to observe this in a few cases, as recovery of the whole finger,\nwhen upward passes were used for the purpose, was generally very rapid.\nOne case is recorded when the sensibility was completely restored by 2\nsuch passes. In 7 cases, however, we detected the gradual recovery\nreferred to, which always followed the rule given. Thus, in one case,\nafter a few upward passes, the tip of the finger only remained insensible ;\nin another case, after 3 passes the upper joint of a thumb became\ncompletely and the lower joint partly sensitive, the sensibility of the\nwhole thumb being completely recovered after 2 more passes ; in a third\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 591\ncase, after 7 passes the two lowest joints of a finger remained completely\ninsensitive while the upper joint had recovered.\nThe recovery of motor power and of sensibility was not always simul\ntaneous. We have noted 5 cases in which the sensibility was recovered\nfirst and none in which the motor power first reappeared. Also, in\nmaking the experiments, the motor power was sometimes lost while\nthe sensibility was wholly or partially retained (this was noted in 5\ncases) ; but we never detected any case in which the loss of sensibility\nextended further than the loss of the motor power. In other words,\nit seemed that the motor effect could be produced both more easily and\nmore completely than the sensory.\nThese latter observations, though only made casually in the course\nof our experiments, are in accordance with the general experience of\nother investigators. In the paper already referred to (Proceedings,\nVol. V., pp. 280-282) on the influence of self-suggestion, it is said\nthat \" muscular rigidity [was the] most general form of phenomenon\nproduced by self-suggestion,\" whereas local ansesthesia appeared more\nrarely. It is well known also that muscular rigidity is one of the\neasiest effects to produce by verbal suggestion.\nSensations Described by the Subjects in the course of tfie Experiments.\nWhen their attention was directed to their hands, the subjects were\nsometimes aware of peculiar sensations in one or more of their fingers\nduring the operation. Mr. Gurney found this with two of his subjects,\nafter he had experimented with them for some time and got them to\nattend to their sensations during the process, and the finger inwhich they\noccurred was nearly always the one under experiment. The prevailing\nsensation was cold, sometimes also \"pins and needles,\" \"numbness,\"\nand the like (Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 15).\nBoth P. and Miss B., when asked to attend to their hands, often\nmentioned a sensation of cold in the selected finger, and if we tested\nat once, we generally found its sensibility reduced below the normal.\nThe difference of temperature, if it existed at all, was not such as to\nbe perceptible to ordinary touch. The sensation of cold soon went off,\nand the finger then became completely anesthetic. It would, of course,\nbe very easy \u2014especially under the circumstances of the experiments\u2014\nto imagine such a feeling as this, but its association with the right finger\nwas certainly significant. The sensation, however, sometimes occurred in\nthe wrong finger, but then anesthesia never followed with P., though it\noccasionally did so with Miss B. In 13 successful trials on two days\nwith P., in which his hands were covered with the glass screen, the.\nsensation was mentioned in the right finger. In 4 of these trials, he\nhad described first a transient feeling in another finger, and in another\n2 B 2\n\fri!)2 il\/rs. H. Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\ncase, which was ;t complete failure, a transient feeling was described\nin a wrong finger. But in none of these 5 cases did the wrontj finger\nbeeome rigid or ansesthetic. There was also one case on another day\n(No. 26) in which the sensation was observed transiently in several\nfingers and finally in the wrist of the left hand, but when he was told\nto close his hands, the right thumb (which was the finger selected)\nwas alone found to be stiff.\nMiss B. in 5 successful experiments mentioned the sensation in the\nright finger only ; in one case she said it was in all her fingers,\nespecially one, which was the right one ; and in two cases, she felt it\nfirst in one or two wrong fingers and then in the right. In all 8 cases,\nthe right fingers only became rigid and amesthetic. In another\nsuccessful experiment, when Mr. Smith was willing that no effect\nshould be produced, she described the sensation in one of her fingers.\nAgain, in the experiment mentioned above, when a spot in the\nmiddle of the lmek of her left hand was selected to be influenced, she\nhail the sensation in the middle finger of her left hand, and in this case\nthe anpesthesia extended alxive and below the spot over the metacarpal\nand proximal joints of the finger.\nCare was, of course, always taken, when the subject first spoke of\nthe sensation, to avoid giving him hints as to whether the finger he\nmentioned was the one we had selected for experiment. After a time\nwe left off encouraging him to pay attention to his sensations, for fear\nof rendering the fingers too susceptible to any chance suggestions.\nWith Miss B., especially, there seemed danger of this. One day we\ntried the effect of using no screen between her and Mr. Smith. He\nstood at the other side of the table on which her hands were placed ami\ntried to influence the chosen finger by merely looking at it and willing\nthe effect without pointing. Three experiments were tried, of\nwhich the second only was successful. In the first, Miss B. described\nthe sensation successively in two fingers\u2014a wrong one and the right\none\u2014and lxith became insensitive ; in the third, the sensation was\nmentioned successively in three fingers\u2014the right one and two others\n\u2014and all three became insensitive. These experiments could not, of\ncourse, have been regarded as evidential in any case, because if they\nhad succeeded it would have been uncertain whether Miss B. could not\nhave seen which finger Mr. Smith was looking at. Their chief interest\nlies in their showing the extreme degree of suggestibility attained,\nwhich was perhaps greater on this occasion than usual, on account of\nthe operator being visible to the subject ; but it is also interesting to\nobserve that the degree of success obtained was much less than usual,\nin spite of\u2014-or perhaps because of (cf. below, p. 596)\u2014the inadequacy of\nthe means taken for excluding conscious impressions as to the finger\nselected.\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 593\nWith T. very few experiments were made, since it was found that\nthe effects could not be generally confined to one finger, the right\nlinger and one of its neighbours being sometimes affected. Mr. Gurney\nfound the same difficulty with some subjects.\nConclusion.\nIt will probably be expected of us that we should state what\nconclusions we ourselves draw from the long series of experiments and\nobservations here recorded.\nIn the first place, we think that they add materially to the already\naccumulated evidence for the fact of telepathy or communication between\nmind and mind otherwise than through the ordinary channels of sense.\nIn discovering the nature of this communication, however,\u2014how it\nworks and what conditions are favourable to it,\u2014we fear that we have\nadvanced very little. Still, our experiments suggest some reflexions\nand some tentative conclusions which it may be worth while to put\ntogether here.\nAmong these we may refer to the danger, already discussed on p\n\u2022\"i79, of drawing conclusions from negative experiments. We have\nencountered instances of this on two lines of experiment\u2014those with\nfingers and those with numbers, in lxith of which conditions apparently\nfatal to success at one time were subsequently found to present no\ninsuperable obstacle. Two lessons may be learnt from this. The first\nis merely that it would be premature to despair of obtaining success at\ngreater distances than we have yet done. The second is that the obstacle\novercome in each case cannot have been merely physical or it would\nhave been more constant in its action ; it must have had a large\npsychical element in it. Possibly it may have been of the nature of\nthe want of confidence that sometimes makes a man unable to jump at\nall when he fears that the height required is beyond his power.\nIf this last surmise is correct, it would appear natural to suppose\nthat it is the agent whose efficiency is affected by the distance or other\nseeming obstacle, rather than the percipient. This we believe to be\noften the case ; for in the finger experiments the percipient had, we\nthink, no means of knowing through his senses the variations in the\nconditions,\u2014e.g., whether Mr. Smith was pointing or not pointing,\u2014so\nlong as he remained within a few feet of him.\nIt is probable, however, that the percipient is also liable to be\naffected by supposed difficulties when aware of changed conditions, for\nthere can, we think, be no doubt that the possibility of telepathic\ncommunication depends on both agent and percipient, and perhaps on a\nrelation between the two. The principal facts observed in the course of\nour own experiments which support this conclusion are (1) the success\nof Mr. Smith and of P. and T. as agents, when others failed ; (2) Mr\n\f594 Mrs. H. S'ulgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nSmith's failure with various persons not mentioned in our paper, some\nof them quite goixl hypnotic subjects and easily suggestible by him ;\n(3) Miss Charlesworth's failure with Whybrew (who was a good per\ncipient relatively to Mr. Smith), though she had hypnotised him (see p.\n~i7ii), and though she had, she told us, succeeded with another percipient\n-a lady- some months before.' This failure may, however, have been\ndue to some change in the conditions affecting herself only.\nSuccess in thought-transference depending thus on both agent and\npercipient would naturally vary with conditions affecting either. That\nit varied with conditions affecting the percipient is certain ; for it\noften happened that Mr. Smith could impress one of the percipients on\ndays when another seemed quite impervious to telepathically trans\nferred ideas. We thought that there was also some ground, besides\nthat derived from the finger experiments and already mentioned, for\nthinking that failure was sometimes due to unknown conditions affect\ning the agent only ; because it appeared to us that P. or T. could occa\nsionally succeed as agents better than Mr. Smith, though the latter\nwas on the whole the more effective agent.\nThe difficulty and uncertainty of these experiments are chiefly due\nto the great variableness in conditions beyond our control, and if we\ncould discover something about these conditions, decided progress\nwould have been made in the investigation. But here we have very\nlittle to record in the way of conclusions and can only note down a\nfew scattered observations.\nWe had some reason to think that freshness of interest in the\nexperiments on the part of agent and percipient and perhaps in others\nconcerned had a favourable effect, so that new kinds of experiment or\nexperiments with a new percipient sometimes succeeded best at first.\nThus with Miss B., the earlier number experiments, the earlier picture\nexperiments, and the earlier experiments in transferring hallucinations\nwere the best. On the other hand, a development of power seemed\nto take place, such as made it ultimately possible to transfer numbers\nfrom a distance and to stiffen fingers without approximating the hand ;\nand success certainly had a tendency to produce further success.\nAttention on the part of the agent both to the idea to be trans\nferred and to the percipient seems a necessary, accompaniment of an\nintentional telepathic transference, and it is in fact difficult to imagine\nhow such a transference could be consriously attempted without this.\nBut we think it very doubtful whether this attention is at all\nessential to the process of transference itself, whatever that may be ;\nfor in deferred successes (see above, p.3-18, and Proceedings, Vol. VI.,.\np. 161), the agent's attention is not at the moment on the object,.\n' I nfortunately no notes were taken at the time of her experiments with this lady.\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 595\nand, as we found once or twice in our experiments in 1889 (Proceedings,\nVol. VI., pp. 151, 163), a percipient to whom the agent is not con\nsciously attending will sometimes receive the idea to be transferred.\nWhether conscious attention or effort was ever necessary or\nadvantageous on the percipient's part is questionable, but we are in\nclined to think not. In the finger experiments it was certainly un\nnecessary ; the percipient was then quite normal and might, and often\ndid, talk energetically about other things all the time, and the finger\nmight be rendered anesthetic, tested and restored without his knowing\nthat anything had happened. The results obtained by the planchette\nand by table-tilting, too, seemed entirely automatic and independent of\nthe percipient's normal consciousness, so that, if he knew what he\nwas guessing, it was by observation of an occurrence with which\nhe had had nothing consciously to do. With numbers or pictures,\nwhen the object guessed was seen or heard as a hallucination or quasi-\nhallucination, it was, of course, necessary that this should be con\nsciously perceived, or it could not have been described to us. But\nthere is no reason to think that the initial process in these cases was\ndifferent, or more likely to be affected by the percipient's conscious\neffort ; for the idea did not consciously precede the hallucination, the\npercipient only became aware of it through the hallucination. When\nimpressions were long in coming, we used sometimes to urge the per\ncipient to try to see the number or picture, and P., especially, used\nspontaneously and emphatically to protest that he really was trying his\nbest ; but we never had any reason to think that this trying had any\ngood effect on the result. Of course, we do not mean that expectation\non the percipient's part was not a favourable condition ;\u2014it probably\nwas. But the expectation which assists or produces sensory effects\nbeyond our ordinary control, such as anesthesia or sensory hallucina\ntions, is generally of a subconscious kind, involving no consciously\ndirected attention. What we conceive to happen with our percipients\nis that, having placed themselves in a general readiness to see some\nhallucinatory number or picture, or for one finger to become rigid and\nanesthetic, the particular number or particular finger is determined by\nsome impulse, and the desired motor or sensory effect is carried out by\nsome operation of the mind,' of which they are entirely unaware.\nThis brings us to the last point to which we wish to draw atten\ntion, namely, the much greater uniformity of success in the experiments\ni We luwl the idea that it might help us if we could make use of the subcon-\nscioua part of the agent's mind as well as the percipient's, and that, c.y., a post\nhypnotic hallucination experienced by the agent might be more easily transferred\nthan an ordinary idea, but most of our experiments under this condition were made\nwith agent and percipient in different hou,es, and failed. We still think that the\ncondition may be a favourable one and hope to make further experiments on this\npoint.\n\f590 Mrs. H. fiidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson.\nwith fingers than in any others. Practically, with P. and Miss B. and\nwith Mr. Gurney's subjects, success could be relied on in these experi\nments when Mr. Smith pointed at the finger to be affected (at any rate,\nuntil our last two days, when, if we may use a metaphor, we had perhaps\nput the machinery out of gear by varying the experiments too much) ;\nwhile in all our other forms of thought-transference experiment';, success\nvaried from day to day in the most inexplicable manner. Now, the most\nmarked difference between the finger experiments and others is that\nat no stage do the finger experiments affect any process with which the\nnormal consciousness of the percipient is ever concerned, and perhaps\nwe may legitimately draw the inference that the more his conscious\nintelligence can be kept out of the way the easier success will be. If\nthis be so, it may be profitable at the present stage of our inquiries to\ndirect our attention more than we have hitherto done to producing by\ntelepathy physiological effects, and such simple movements as are con\nstantly performed unconsciously, taking care of course with these last\nthat they are not such as the conscious intelligence would naturally\ninhibit, since this would probably introduce an element of difficulty.\nThe fact that such effects and such actions are among those most easily\nproduced by verbal suggestion adds to the probability that mental\nsuggestion, too, would here find its easiest sphere of action.\n\fNupplcmentl 597\n'William Stainton-Moses.\nSUPPLEMENT.\ni.\nWILLIAM STAINTON-MOSES.\nIn here commemorating the decease, on September 5th, at the age of fifty-\nthree, of my old friend, William Stainton-Moses, it would have been more\ncongenial to my feelings to have confined myself to a brief but sincere\nexpression of personal respect and regard. But I should not thus do justice\nto the deep significance of certain events in his career. I personally regard\nhis life as one of the most noteworthy lives of our generation ; and from few\nmen have I heard at first hand facts comparable in importance for me with\nthose which I heard from him. Statements like these need serious justifica\ntion ; nor can they be justified without a perfectly frank discussion both of\nhis gifts and of his limitations. What I shall now say I have said in effect to\nhimself, without offence ; and his other friends, I trust, will feel that it is\nonly by recognising his points of deficiency\u2014unimportant in themselves, but\nwidely observable and observed\u2014that we can effectively claim recognition for\nhis substantial worth, or attention for the weighty message which his personal\nexperiences hold for mankind.\nIt was on May 9th, 1874, that Edmund Gurney and I met Stainton-Moses\nfor the first time, through the kindness of Mrs. Cowper-Temple (now Lady\nMount-Temple), who knew that we had become interested in \" psychical \"\nproblems, and wished to introduce us to a man of honour who had recently\nexperienced phenomena, due wholly to some gift of his own, which had\nprofoundly changed his conception of life.\nThat evening was epoch-making in Gurney's life and mine. Standing as\nwe were in the attitude natural at the commencement of such inquiries, under\nsuch conditions as were then attainable\u2014 an attitude of curiosity tempered\nby a vivid perception of difficulty and drawback\u2014we now met a man of\nUniversity education, of manifest sanity and probity, who vouched to us for\na series of phenomena\u2014occurring to himself, and with no doubtful or venal\naid\u2014which seemed at least to prove, in confusedly intermingled form, three\nmain theses unknown to Science. These were (1) the existence in the human\nspirit of hidden powers of insight and of communication ; (2) the personal\nsurvival and near presence of the departed ; and (3) interference, due to\nunknown agencies, with the ponderable world. He spoke frankly and fully ; he\nshowed his notebooks ; he referred us to his friends ; ho inspired a belief\nwhich was at once sufficient, and which is still sufficient, to prompt to action.\nThe facts which thus impressed us found printed record mainly in a small\n\f598 William Stainton-Moses. Isupplement.\nbook called spirit Identity, now out of print. Some were described in\narticles in Human Nature, a magazine since defunct. We obtained verbal\ncorroboration from Mr. F. W. Percival, Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford,,\nand from the late Serjeant Cox. And quite recently the contemporaneous\nnotes of Mrs. Speer, fully corroborating Stainton-Moses' own account, have\nbeen appearing in the pages of Liyht.\nThis certainly is not a very complete or satisfactory manner of setting\nforth a message of great import to mankind. But both the virtues and the\ndefects of the recipient of that message were such as to render him ill-suited\nto obtain for it the serious attention of the scientific world.\nThe experiences which Stainton-Moses had undergone had changed his\nviews but not his character. He was already set in the mould of the hard\nworking, conscientious, dogmatic clergyman, with a strong desire to do good,\nand a strong belief in preaching as the best way to do it. For himself the\nessential part of what I have called his \"message \" lay in the actual words\nautomatically uttered or written\u2014not in the accompanying phenomena which\nreally gave their uniqueness and importance to the automatic processes now\nso familiar. In a book called Spirit Teachings he collected what he\nregarded as the rotl fruits of those years of mysterious listening in the\nvestibule of a world unknown.\nAnd much as we may regret this too exclusive ethical preoccupation in n\u2022\nregion where the establishment of actual fact is still the one thing needful, it\nmust be admitted that twenty years ago the scientific importance of these\nphenomena had hardly dawned on any mind. Among all the witnesses of D. D.\nHome's marvels Mr. Crookes was almost the only man who made any attempt\nto treat them as reasonable men treat all the facts of nature. Most of the wit\nnesses, though fully believing in the genuineness of the wonders, appear to have\nregarded them as a kind of uncanny diversion. The more serious sought for\nassurance that their beloved dead were still near them, and straitly charged\nMr. Home to tell no man of the proofs which they said had brought to\nthemselves unspeakable joy. An attempt made, in 1875, by Serjeant Cox\nand a few others (among whom were Stainton-Moses and myself), to get\nthese phenomena more seriously discussed in a \"Psychological Society\"\nlanguished for want of suitable coadjutors, and on the death of Serjeant Cox\n(in 187!*) the Society was dissolved. During these important years, therefore,\nwhile his experiences were fresh in Stainton-Moses' mind, and while they\nwere to some extent still recurring, he had little encouragement to deal with\nthem from a scientific point of view.\nWhen, however, in 1882, Professor Barrett consulted him as to the possi\nbility of founding a new society, under better auspices, he warmly welcomed\nthe plan. Edmund Gurney and I were asked to join, but made it a condi\ntion that the consent of Professor Sidgwick (with whom we had already been\nworking) to act as our President should first be obtained. Under his guid\nance the Society for Psychical Research assumed a more cautious and critical\nattitude than was congenial to Stainton Moses' warm heart, strong convictions,\nand impulsive temper, and in 1886 he left the Society, in consequence of the\npublication in the Proceedings of certain comments on phenomena occurring\nthrough the agency of the so-called \" medium \" Eglinton.\nFrom this time he frankly confessed himself disgusted with our attempts\n\fHupplement.l 599\nWilliam Stainton-Moses.\nat scientific method, and as main contributor to Light and afterwards editor\nuntil his death, he practically reverted to \"Spiritualism as a religion\"\u2014as\nopposed to psychical research as a scientific duty. And assuredly the religious\nimplications of all these phenomena are worthy of any man's most serious\nthought. But those who most feel the importance of the ethical super\nstructure are at the same time most plainly bound to treat the establish\nment of the facts at the foundation as no mere personal search for a faith, to\nbe dropped when private conviction has been attained, but as a serious, a\ncontinuous, a public duty. And the more convinced they are that their faith\nis sound, the more readyjshould they bo to face distrust and aversion,\u2014tolay\ntheir account for a long struggle with the vis inertia of the human spirit.\nStainton-Moses was ill-fitted for this patient, uphill toil. In the first\nplace he lacked\u2014and he readily and repeatedly admitted to me that he\nlacked\u2014all vestige of scientific, or even of legal instinct. The very words\n\" first-hand evidence,\" \" contemporary record,\" \" corroborative testimony,\"'\nwere to him as a weariness to the flesh. His attitude was that of the\npreacher who is already so thoroughly persuaded in his own mind that he\ntreats any alleged fact which falls in with his views as the uncriticised text\nfor fresh exhortation. And in the second place\u2014though this was a minor\nmatter\u2014his natural sensitiveness was sometimes exaggerated by gout and\nother wearing ailments into an irritability which he scarcely felt compelled\nto conceal in a journal circulating mainly among attached disciples.\nThe reason for noticing these defects is that they constitute the only\nground on which Stainton-Moses' trustworthiness as a witness to his own\nphenomena could possibly be impugned. I mention them in order that I\nmay say that, having read, I think, all that he has printed, and having\nwatched his conduct at critical moments, I see much ground for impugning\nhis judgment, but no ground whatever for doubting that he has narrated\nwith absolute good faith the story of his own experience. He allowed mo,\nbefore he left the Society, to examine almost the whole series of his\nautomatic writings ; those especially which contain the evidence on which\ndpirit Identity is based ; and in no instance did I find that the printed\nstatement of any case went beyond the warrant of the manuscript. On the\ncontrary, although that book contains much careless writing and many\ngeneral phrases of a loose rhetorical kind, I believe that the cases themselves,\nif stated with proper completeness, would often be found even stronger\nevidentially than the book makes out.\nLet me go back in memory, then, to 1874, and ask myself how far the\nimpression then made has stood the test of subsequent experience. On the\nnegative side I must place an increased knowledge of the possibility of\nunconscious fraud in abnormal states, and an increased realisation of what\nindeed was at once evident\u2014the unscientific cast of Stainton-Moses' mind.\nOn the positive side I place the important corroborative testimony of Mi s.\nSpeer, now first printed. And I must bear in mind also the significant fact\nthat new and independent evidence has reached us from many quarters of\nphenomena closely parallel to much, though not to all, which seemed isolated\nand exceptional in Stainton-Moses' earlier accounts. On the positive side,\ntoo, I must reckon the way in which his character has worn on the whole\nduring these eighteen years. Those years contained for him much of moral\n\f(;oo ISupplement.\nWilliam Stain ton-Moses.\ntrial, of physical strain and suffering ; but although they brought out errors\nof judgment and temper, they revealed nothing inconsistent with high aims,\nintense convictions, a conscience heedful of the end.\nIf, then, on some future occasion it is permitted to me to analyse the\nrecords of those strange experiences, the reader will understand the attitude\nin which I shall think it right to approach them. We must be on the watch,\nno doubt, for any indication of self-deception, of misinterpretation, of narrow\nviews. But we ought in justice to feel that we are dealing with the work of\na sincere fellow-labourer in our seldom-trodden field.\nThe gift which Stainton-Moses possessed is a strange and perplexing one.\nWe know nothing of the laws which govern its distribution. It is not yet\nrecognised as constituting a claim on the admiration or the gratitude of man\nkind. Yet if, indeed, through such glimpses, such messages, as came to my\nfriend, our race is being obscurely guided into an avenue of eternal hope, it\nmatters little whether we talk of chance or of merit.

It was attended by over 300 persons,\nincluding nearly a hundred visitors from all parts of Europe, and from\nAmerica and Australia. This Congress, although (as will be seen) it was in\nno way identified with the S.P.R., presented, nevertheless, certain points of\ncontact, whose significance we may here endeavour fairly to estimate. The\nCongress met under the Presidency of the President of our Society ; one of\nits Hon. Sees, was one of the Hon. Sees, of the S.P.R. ; and the majority\nof the English members attending were either members of the S.P.R. or\nat least in avowed sympathy with its aims. Taken with all the reservations\nto be presently mentioned, we think that these facts indicate that the severe\ntaboo long imposed upon the subjects with which we deal has been tacitly\nremoved ; and that although little or no scientific credit may yet attach to\nour special researches, yet they are no longer generally regarded as invalidat\ning or depreciating such claim to attention as work in other departments may\nhave secured for any inquirer. Remembering as we do the state of scientific\nfeeling some twenty years ago, when our own attention was first seriously\ndirected to these subjects ;\u2014or even the state of scientific feeling some ten\nyears ago, when the S.P.R. was founded ;\u2014we cannot but feel that this\nforward step has been achieved more rapidly than we had any good ground\nto expect.\nBut while we thus attach much importance to the fact that at this Congress,\nfor the first time in England, the representatives of our Society have claimed\na place for their special investigations, as a recognised department of the\nscientific study of psychology, and have had their claim admitted without\nopposition ; and while we set great value on the harmonious relations that\nwe have thus established with psychologists pursuing more beaten lines of\ninquiry, we do not, of course, infer from these relations that the reality of\ntelepathy or thought-transference is now generally accepted by psychologists.\nNo vote on this subject was taken at the Congress, and we did not desire\nthat it should be taken ; indeed, we were particularly anxious that it should\nbe clearly understood that no one, by attending the Congress, was even in\nthe most indirect way committed to a view in favour of the conclusions which\nthe workers of our Society have put forward. We were quite content to\nhave the unrivalled opportunity which such a Congress affords of drawing\ni An account of the First Congress, which met in Paris, August, 188U, will be\nfound in Proceedingt, Vol. VI., p. 171.\n\f.G02 The Second International Congress of ISupplement.\nthe attention of psychologists to the nature and extent of our evidence, and\nof explaining fully our methods of statistical and experimental inquiry.\nIn order adequately to obtain this advantage, it was necessary that the\nCongress should be\u2014what its first founders in Paris intended it to be\u2014fairly\nand fully representative of the whole range of experimental psychology, and\nshould not merely represent the workers in a limited department of the\nsubject. When, however, the benevolent interest accorded in Paris to our\nspecial lines of inquiry had led us to undertake the duty, offered us by the\nfirst Congress, of organising an International Meeting of Experimental\nPsychologists in London, we were aware that the task of making such a\nmeeting fairly and fully representative of the whole subject would not be\nfree from difficulties. We were aware that the amount of attention given in\nParis to hypnotism and cognate subjects had incurred some disapproval,\nespecially in Germany ; and we were aware that if a Congress in Paris under\nM. Ribot's presidency was found to be in this respect unorthodox, a Congress\nin London presided over by the President of the S.P.R. might be naturally\n.expected to exhibit unorthodoxy of this kind in a still more alarming degree.\nWe were afraid that such expectations might have a tendency to bring about\ntheir own fulfilment, by leading important representatives of more orthodox\npsychology to keep aloof from us.\nAccordingly, we thought it our duty to show clearly, in planning the work\n.of the Congress and inviting papers, that we did not confound our functions\nas organisers of the Congress with our functions as officials of the S.P.R.\nWe therefore took great care to avoid giving an undue place to the inquiries\nin which we were specially interested ; and aimed, on the contrary, at making\n-our list of papers as adequately representative as possible of the various lines\nof inquiry, pursued by very diverse methods, which come within the range\nof psychology,\u2014understood in its widest sense as including the physiology of\nthe brain and nervous system. We think the list of 42 papers (including\nthree reports) which were laid before the Congress shows that we succeeded\ntolerably well in this endeavour. But we could hardly have hoped for any\nthing like this degree of success without the invaluable aid of Professor\nSully, to whose intermediation we were further indebted for the privilege of\nmeeting in the spacious lecture-rooms which the authorities of University\nCollege liberally placed at our disposal.\nReassured by the comprehensive nature of our programme, and by the\nnames of the contributors who had responded to the invitations of the two\nsecretaries, the foreign psychologists attended in numbers that realised our\nhighest hopes. The greatest of the living men of science of Germany\u2014 von\nHelmholtz\u2014attended the afternoon meetings of the first two days, before he\npassed on to the British Association in Edinburgh. Besides him, the\nUniversity of Berlin was represented by Professors Preyer and Ebbinghaus,\nwho both contributed papers on the interesting subjects of the \"Origin of\nNumbers\" and \"Colour-Perception\" respectively. Dr. Goldscheider, of\nBerlin, who was unable to come, also contributed a valuable paper on \" The\nMuscular Sense of the Blind.\" Professor Miinsterberg, of Freiburg, and\nProfessor Lange, of Odessa, also represented the German school of psychology\nby contributing papers, though they were prevented by illness from being\npresent in person. On the more physiological side, Germany was represented\n\fExperimental Psychologg. 603\nby the distinguished name of Hitzig, who contributed an account of the cure\n-of attacks of morbid sleep by hypnotic suggestion. From France we had\nProfessor Richet and Professor Pierre Janet, with whose names all our\nreaders will be familiar ; Professors Bernheim, Delboeuf, and Liegeois, known\nto all students of hypnotism ; as well as Dr. B^rillon, editor of the Revue\nde I'Hypnotisme, and M. Marillier, who has had the conduct of the Census of\nHallucinations in France. All these contributed papers or reports ; and we\nalso received papers from Dr. Liebeault, the founder of the ' ' School of\nNancy,\" and Professor Beaunis\u2014formerly at Nancy\u2014who co-operated in\nsecuring for the School of Nancy the recognition of the value of its work in\nhypnotism which is now generally accorded to it. Belgium, Denmark,\nHolland, Norway, Sweden, Roumania, and Russia also furnished representa\ntives and contributors ; and the Transatlantic activity which is now being\nturned into the direction of experimental psychology found expression in\nfour papers\u2014one of these being by a lady, Mrs. Ladd Franklin, who main\ntained a theory of \" Colour-Perception \" opposed to that of Professor\nEbbinghaus. Among the well-known English psychologists or philosophers\nwho attended we may mention the distinguished names of Dr. Bain, Mr.\nShadworth Hodgson, and Mr. A. J. Balfour, the first of whom opened the\nproceedings with a weighty paper on \" The Respective Spheres and Mutual\nAids of Introspection and Experiment in Psychology.\"\nThe abundance of our material having rendered a division into sections\nnecessary, we thought it best to allot Neurology and Psychophysics to one\nsection (A), and Hypnotism and cognate questions to another section (B).\nThe discussions of section B were carried on for three mornings\u2014Tuesday,\nWednesday and Thursday ; along with these, the discussion on a paper by\nProfessor Janet, read on Monday afternoon, on a peculiar case of loss of\nmemory, and that on the Report of the Census of Hallucinations, which was\nread on Wednesday afternoon, form the part of the whole proceedings which\nproperly comes within the scope of our Society. We propose accordingly,\nin the detailed account that follows, to confine ourselves to these discussions,\nbut we must not omit to notice that Professor Richet in the suggestive sketch\nof the Future of Psychology, with which he opened the proceedings on\nMonday afternoon, allotted an important place to the \" psychologie trans-\ncendentale \" which we claim as our special concern.\nProfessor Janet gave a description of a case of amnesia which differed\nfrom ordinary loss of memory in being not merely \"retrograde\" but\n\"antegressive,\" i.e., the patient had not merely lost a portion of her stored\nrecollections of the past, but also her power of acquiring new recollections.\nThe malady was due to an emotional shock caused\u2014on August 28th, 1891\u2014\nby a heartless practical joke : in consequence of the shock she appeared not\nmerely to have lost the memory of all events that had occurred during the\nsix weeks preceding August 28th, but also to have become incapable of\nremembering anything that had occurred since : all impressions seemed to\n\u00ablido over her without leaving the least trace. But some sentences uttered\nin sleep showed that though these recollections were now lost to her waking\nconsciousness, they had not vanished altogether, and the application of\nhypnotism was found to restore them completely during the hypnotic trance.\nProfessor Janet also found that even in her waking state there was an\n\f604 The Second International Congress of ISupplement.\nunconscious memory of theuo apparently forgotten events, of which he\nobtained evidence by means of automatic writing or speaking, performed\nwhen her consciousness was concentrated on some other process. His\nexplanation was that the malady had not affected the memory\u2014taken in its\nwidest sense\u2014but had produced a peculiar kind of \" desagr\u00a3gation psycho-\nlogique \" by weakening the patient's power of \" attachingto her personality \"\nher more recent experiences.\nProfessor Ebbinohaus, of Berlin, while recognising the interest of the\nfacts brought before the Congress by Professor Janet, was inclined to suggest\na different explanation ; viz., that the patient's consciousness was so com\npletely absorbed by present feelings and perceptions that she had not spare\nmental energy sufficient for the work of reproducing past experiences unti)\nthe distractions of the present were shut out. Accordingly, in sleep, or in\nthe hypnotic trance, the absence of such distractions was naturally accom\npanied by the revival of memory.\nThe President pointed out that though Dr. Ebbinghaus' explanation\ningeniously met the facts of recovery of memory in dreams and the hypnotic\ntrance, it hardly seemed applicable to the manifestation of unconscious or\nsubconscious memory through automatic speaking and writing in the norma!\nstate.\nOn Tuesday morning, after a paper from Dr. Liebeault, on a \" Case of\nSuicidal Mania Cured by Suggestion,\" had been read by Professor LitSgeois,\nan interesting discussion was introduced by a paper of Dr. Van Eeden,\nadvocating strongly the use of suggestion as a therapeutic agency, but\ndeprecating the use of hypnotism strictly so-called ; on the ground that the\nheightened suggestibility of the hypnotic state was an \"abnormal con\ndition \" depending on \"ataxia or disintegration of the psyche,\" which must\nbe strictly avoided. In Dr. Van Eeden's view therapeutic suggestion\nshould be addressed \" to the intellect and conscious volition of the sufferer.\n. . . Suggestibility, as denned by French authors, consists of two parts,\nideoplastic power \"\u2014i.e., influence of ideas on bodily functions\u2014\"and im\npressionability.\" His idea is to increase ideoplastic power, and bring it as\nmuch as possible under the influence of conscious volition, without in\ncreasing impressionability.\nThe discussion on this paper was opened by Dr. Bernheim, who denied\nthe \"abnormality\" of the hypnotic state. The heightened suggestibility\nwhich Dr. Van Eeden regards as evidence of abnormality is found\u2014urged\nDr. Bernheim\u2014in ordinary sleep; dreams are \"sensorial self-suggestions.\"\nAt the same time, there are undoubtedly many ways in which suggestion\nmay be made to operate apart from hypnotism, e.g., in the processes of\nhydrotherapy and electrotherapy.\nDr. Berillon considered that the School of Nancy went too far in\nidentifying hypnotic suggestibility and the hypnotic trance with ordinary-\nsuggestibility and ordinary sleep. The artificial suppression of cerebral\ncontrol and the temporary reduction of the subject to an automaton in the\nhands of the hypnotiser\u2014doubtless in consequence of the temporary torpor\nof certain cerebral cells\u2014must be regarded as the special characteristic of the\nhypnotic state. It was therefore abnormal, though Dr. Berillon by no.\nmeans thought that it ought therefore to be excluded from medical use.\n\fSupplement.l 605\nExperimentid Psychologg.\nDr. Bebnhbim said that the susceptibility to external suggestion which\nDr. BiSrillon regarded as peculiar to the hypnotic trance might also he\ndeveloped in ordinary sleep, if suggestions were given to the sleeper in such\na manner as not to awaken him.\nProfessor Dei-bieuf, of Liege, agreed with Professor Bernheim that\nthere was nothing abnormal in the hypnotic state. He also agreed that\ncurative suggestion might be equally effective without hypnotisation as with\nit ; illustrating this by some striking examples from his own experience.\nDr. Sperling, of Berlin, said that as we do not yet know what normal sleep\nis, it is not easy to say whether the hypnotic trance is the same or something\ndifferent. Also we must avoid falling into a dispute about words. The\nhypnotic sleep was clearly a state of heightened suggestibility, but it was\nequally true that high suggestibility was sometimes found in the waking state ;\nand undoubtedly suggestion was often a factor in other modes of treatment\nthan the hypnotic\u2014such as electrotherapy, to which Dr. Bernheim had\nreferred. Only it was impossible to say exactly how far suggestion operated\nbefore we had estimated what electricity\u2014or any similar agent\u2014could do\nwithout suggestion. The determination of this by careful experiment was a\npoint of much importance.\nAfter this discussion there was an interesting controversy between Dk.\nBekn'Heim and Dr. Mendelssohn, from St. Petersburg. The former con\ntended, in a paper on \" Hysterical Amblyopia,\" that hysterical defects of\nvision and all the disorders and diminutions of sensibility in hysterical\nsubjects were \"purely psychical\"; i.e., that the sense-perceptions in such\ncases were normal, but that self-suggestion prevented them from having\ntheir due effect on the subject's mind. Dr. Mendelssohn, on the other\nhand, argued that some more constant cerebral cause was to be inferred\nfrom the regularity with which similar effects manifested themselves in\ndifferent cases of hysterical affections.\nOn Wednesday morning Professor Delbocuf, of Liege, began the first\npaper, which was on \"TheAppreciation of Time bySomnambulists, \"and which\nis printed in full in this part of our Proceedings, by distinguishing the cases\nbrought forward by him from the ordinary cases of suggestions called \" Sug\ngestions a echeance \"\u2014i.e., suggestions to be realised at a distant date\u2014\nwhich only proved that a hypnotised subject was capable of performing an\nact at a date indicated a long time in advance, without any consciousness of\nthe real motive force that prompted the act. But the faculty that he had\nstudied was different ; it was that of appreciating more or less approximately,\nwithout conscious calculation or means of indication, the passing of time.\nHe had studied it with two young, robust and healthy countrywomen, now\nmarried and mothers, good somnambulists, whose names were constantly to\nbe met with in his works on hypnotism. Those two subjects were incapable\nof reducing exactly into hours and minutes a number of minutes such as\n1,000 or even 350, much more of calculating at what hour the 1,050th minute\nafter 6.35 p.m. would fall. They received suggestions which they were to\nperform after 350, 900, 1,600, 1,150, 1,300, 3,300 minutes. In two cases out\nof thirteen the suggested acts were performed exactly at the time ordered ;\nin the other eleven cases the time at which they were performed differed\nfrom the time suggested by a period varying from ^th to -:?7th of the whole\n2 s\n\fG06 The Second International Congress of isuppiem-nt.\ninterval fixed. M. Delboeuf ended by saying that he drew no conclusion\nfrom his experiments except that the subject was one to be studied.\nAfter the conclusion of Dr. Delbteuf's paper\nThe President said that he had listened with great interest to Professor\nDelbceuf's account of his experiments. If he might venture to rush in where\nthe caution of the author had prevented him from treading, and attempt a\nsolution of the remarkable results described, he would suggest that we might\nsuppose that both the power of estimating the lapse of time, and also the\npower of counting, ordinarily possessed by M. Delboeuf's two subjects, had\nbeen extended in consequence of the hypnotic condition, perhaps owing to\nthe concentration of cerebral energy incident to that condition. Such an\nextension would seem to be more or less analogous to the extensions of the\nfaculties of sense-perception that frequently occur in the hypnotic trance.\nIt seemed to him that this explanation was rendered all the more probable\nby the fact that the act ordered was not performed exactly at the time or\ndered in 11 out of the 13 experiments tried by M. Delboeuf. It is natural\nto suppose that in these cases the reckoning had been only rough and ap\nproximate.\n\" In connection with this question,\" he continued, \" it seems to me that\nit would be worth while to make a systematic inquiry into the supposed\npower of knowing the lapse of time in sleep, which many persons believe\nthemselves to possess. If it could be shown that the human organism can\nsomehow measure the lapse of time in sleep more accurately than it can\nmeasure this lapse through an equally long period of waking life\u2014without\nthe aid of clocks or watches\u2014it would be easier to understand how this in\ncreased faculty of time-measurement should appear in the hypnotic state\nNow, probably we have all met persons, of the most highly educated class,\nwho firmly believe themselves to have the power of waking at any hour they\nlike\u2014to cateh a train, or for any similar object. For such practical purposes\na very rough approximation would, of course, be sufficient, and the explana\ntion of the alleged faculty which is usually accepted among scientific persons\nwho do not possess it is that the self-waker has really only the power of\ngiving himself a lighter sleep than usual, so that he probably wakes several\ntimes during the night, or wakes early\u2014when the morning light and noises\nbegin to assail his senses\u2014and then dozes and wakes at brief intervals till\nthe appointed time arrives. But I have met several persons who altogether\ndeny that their own experiences can be explained in this way : and in one or\ntwo of the experiments that I have persuaded them to try, a remarkable\ndegree of exactitude without previous waking has been reported. Systematic\nexperiments on the point are, however, much to be desired, and my object\nin speaking now is, if possible, to persuade some of the persons who believe\nthemselves to possess this power to make such experiments in sufficient\nnumber and with the care and exactness in recording conditions which are,\nof course, indispensable, if the result is to have any scientific value. It\nwould be necessary to write down overnight, in hours and minutes, the hour\nappointed for waking ; then to note the exact time of waking that came\nnearest to this, and at least the number\u2014if not the exact times\u2014of the\nwakings that had occurred previously during the night : to exclude all sounds\nof clocks or church bells, and, if possible, by varying the conditions, to\n\fSupplement.l 607\nExperimental Psychologg.\nexclude any important operations of changes in light and noise, and in any\ncase to note these last. If any self-waker will have the patience to try such\n.experiments systematically and to record the results, I shall be much obliged\nto him if he will either send me such record, or notify me where it is pub\nlished.\"\nThen followed a paper by Professor Hitzk;, describing a remarkable\ncase of cure of morbid sleep-attacks by hypnotic suggestion. After this Mr.\nMyers read a paper on the \" Experimental Induction of Hallucinations,\"\nwhich appears, in an expanded form, in this part of our Proceedings. Some\ncomments from Professor Janet which followed, are now embodied in the\npaper itself (p. 482).\nOn Wednesday afternoon Professor Sidgwick read in an abridged form\nn part of his final Report on the Census of Hallucinations,\u2014of which two\nud interim reports have been already published in our Proceediays. It is\nhoped to publish the whole report in an early number of these Proceed\nings. Professor Sidgwick began by describing the somewhat elaborate\nmethod used to secure as complete accuracy as possible in the statement of\nthe results of the 17,000 answers received by him to the questions circulated.\nSpeaking broadly, it appeared that about one in ten of the persons (taken at\nrandom) from whom inquiry was made remembered experiences of the kind\ninquired into. . Among these the largest class consisted of realistic human\napparitions of living people or unrecognised human figures, the number of\napparitions of dead persons being relatively small, and the number of grotesque\napparitions still smaller. In only a very small percentage of cases was there\nany observed disturbance of health at the time of the hallucination\u2014the\nhallucinations of fever and madness having been excluded by the\noriginal definition. A remarkable class of cases was that of collective\napparitions, the same hallucinations being simultaneously perceived by two\nor more persons. In some of these there seemed a possibility of verbal\nsuggestion from one percipient to another ; in others no communication\nseemed to have been possible except such as may exist independently of any\nof the recognised organs of sense. The collective class led on to the still\nmore remarkable class of coincidental hallucinations, or those which occur\nsimultaneously with some distant event with which they seem to be con\nnected, especially the death of the person whose figure appears. The actual\nproportion of coincidental to non-coincidental cases, after all deductions for\npossible sources of error, was in fact such that the probability against the\nsupposition of chance coincidence became enormous, on the assumption of\nordinary accuracy on the part of informants. If the theory of a causal con\nnection was to be set aside it must be by straining the assumption of\ninaccuracy on the informant's part to an extreme pitch.\nM. Marillier, in the course of his report on the inquiries made iu\nPrance on the same subject, stated that he had had great difficulty in obtain\ning any replies to his inquiries. This was due to several causes, among which\nthe chief was the repugnance of the French public to give any information\non psychological subjects. The statistical results obtained by M. Marillier\ncoincided broadly with the result of the English investigation : and the same\n\u2022 is true of the results of the American inquiry, forwarded by Mr. Hodgson.\nIn the discussion that followed\u2014\n2 S 3\n\f608 The Second International Congress of ISupplement\nDr. O.hler (Johns Hopkins University) remarked that no one who saw\na hallucinatory figure could foe said to foe in good health of foody and mind.\nThe mere fact of experiencing a hallucination implied some serious organic\ndisturbance.\nDr. Elizabeth Blackwell said that a new meaning seemed to have\nbeen given to the term \" hallucination \" in the report that they had heard :\nsince, as commonly used in medicine, the term implied morbidity.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers said that Dr. Osier's view was hardly tenable in\nface of the fact with which hypnotism had made us familiar\u2014that a full\nblown hallucination could be produced in many healthy subjects by a mere\n\" post-hypnotic order,\" with no concomitant or subsequent organic disturb\nance. A rarer, but even more instructive, class of experimental hallucina\ntions were those caused from a distance by an effort of concentration on the\npart of the agent. He saw among the audience Dr. Freiherr von Schrenck-\nNotzing, who had made a successful experiment of this rare kind.\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzino then described briefly the experiment more\nfully recorded in the Journal for October, 1888 (Vol. III., p. 307). The\ndesign of this experiment was to impress, if possible, an idea of himself on a\nfriend at a distance, who had no knowledge that the experiment was being\ntried. What in fact happened was that the friend had a hallucinatory\nvision of him, coinciding in time with the experiment ; as he afterwards\nlearnt, both from the percipient herself, and from a friend who was with her\nat the time.\nProfessor Franklin (Johns Hopkins University) held that if the hallu\ncinatory apparition was of a person known to be ill\u2014even if the knowledge\nwere not accompanied by anxiety\u2014the chances against the coincidence of\nhallucination and death would be very much reduced.\nThe President said that no doubt the chances would foe somewhat-\nreduced in this case : since, if the percipient's state of health at the time\nwere such as to cause a hallucination it would perhaps be more probable\nthat it would take the form of a friend known to be ill than of one known\nto be well. But mere knowledge without anxiety could not foe regarded as a\nvera causa of hallucinations : therefore, if\u2014as was most frequently the case\nin his collection\u2014the hallucination were the percipient's only experience of\nthe kind, the chances would still foe very much against its coinciding acci\ndentally with the death of a friend. In reply to Dr. Osier, he wished to\nexplain that the statements with regard to health in the report were made,\nafter careful consideration of the answers received, with the advice and con\ncurrence of a physician who was a member of the Committee.\nThe first paper on Thursday morning was read by Dr. Berillon, editor\nof the Revue da VHypnotixme. It was entitled \"Lea Applications de la\nSuggestion Hypnotique it l'Education. \" He said that in 1886 he had first called\nattention to the application which might be made of suggestion in education.\nSince then he had tried to induce hypnotism in 250 children of both sexes,\nfrom which experiments he had deduced the following conclusions. Of ten\nchildren from six to fifteen years, taken from all classes of society, eight were\nsusceptible of being sent into a profound sleep after the first or second seance.\nHohust, healthy children whose hereditary antecedents were in no way un\n\fsupplement.l Experimental Psychologg. GO!)\nfavourable were generally very liable to suggestion, and consequently very\neasily hypnotised. This capacity for suggestion and hypnotism had been\nutilised to treat the following cases, which concerned education as much as\nmedicine :\u2014Nervous insomnia, terror manifested at night, somnambulism,\nkleptomania, tics, stammering, inveterate idleness, uncleanliness, cowardice,\nthe habit of biting the nails, and moral perversity. These facts had since\nbeen verified by a large number of authors. They constituted the practical\n-side of psychology. Suggestion afforded a process of psychological investiga\ntion which enabled them to submit to a rigorous analysis the development of\nthe various intellectual faculties in the child, and to benefit education by the\nuse of the experimental method.\nDr. Van Eeuen considered that artifices such as paralysing the arm by\n-suggestion, which Dr. Berillon had described himself as using in an extreme\n.case of thievish disposition, wore undesirable with children, and that moral\nsuggestion alone should be employed.\nDr. Bernheim was of opinion that regular hypnotisation was not often\njieeded with young children. The mother was able to inspire the needed\nsuggestions at times of special susceptibility, as during the act of falling\nasleep. Even when asleep children would usually respond to any verbal sug\ngestion. It was impossible to create either an intelligence or a moral sense\nnot born in a child ; but it was possible and desirable to repair by suggestion\nthose perversions of moral sense which were merely due to the influence of\nbad companionship.\nM. Berillon replied that it was impossible to say by simple inspection\nwhether the lack of moral sense in a child was due to original defect or to\nsubsequent perversion. The result of treatment alone would show.\nM. Delbieuf agreed with Dr. Van Eeden that physical artifices were of\nlittle service in curing a child, say, of the habit of theft.\nM. Berillon agreed that the physical artifice should be regarded as a last\nresort.\nDr. von ScHreXCK-NoTzinti, of Munich, expressed the hope that Dr.\nBerillon's interesting paper, when published, would contain statistical state\nments, indicating the proportion of successor to failures in his experience,\nand carefully distinguishing transient from permanent effects.\nThe Presibent (Professor Sidgwick) said that he thought they would all\nagree that Dr. Van Eeden's method of appealing to the child's moral sense\nshould be the only one tried in ordinary cases. But he thought that Dr.\nBerillon had sufficiently guarded himself against being supposed to do more\nthan recommend hypnotic treatment as supplementing, not supplanting,\nmoral suasion. It seemed to him that, so restricted, it was a valuable instru\nment which it would be a mistake to reject.\nMrs. SiDi;wicK then read a paper on some experiments in thought-\ntransference, which is published in an expanded form in this part of our\nJProeeedi,wjs.\nThe proceedings of the morning concluded with a paper by Professor\nLteoeois (of Nancy) on a case of poisoning under the influence, as he believed,\nof suggestion ; which led to a discussion on the justice of punishing crimes\ncommitted under the overmastering influence of another will.\nOn two afternoons during the Congress Dr. Bramwell gave interesting\n\fCIO The Second International Congress of Isupplement.\nillustrations of some of the effects of hypnotism, and described some of his\nexperiences in producing analgesia, relieving from sea-sickness, &e. One of\nthe most interesting things he described was the removal, in one case, of\nmyopia by suggestion. He especially dwelt on the fact that it was easy to\ninsure that patients should exercise free choice as to whether they would\naccept or reject any particular suggestion of their hypnotiser.\nThe names thus mentioned of the principal speakers in the Hypnotic\nSection seem fairly representative of the study and practice of hypnotism at\nthe present moment, and although the papers covered a wide range, the\ngrowth of certain general tendencies, as compared with the Congress held in\nParis three years since, might be plainly noted. Speaking broadly, there\nwas a tendency to greater agreement as to fact, and to greater diffidence as.\nto theory.\nI. In the first place, as to the actual observed facts of hypnotism, there is\nnow a more universal admission of the theinjieutic advantage derivable fronv\nhypnotic suggestion. The former doubt as to this beneficial action was\nmainly connected with the view, now rapidly losing ground, that hypnotism,\nwas in itself a form of hysteria, and likely to induce other forms. It still\nremains impossible to doubt that injudicious hypnotism may do serious,\nharm ; but the mishaps thus far recorded have been fewer than was probably\nexpected in any quarter. On the other hand, many of the cures effected by\nsuggestion have now had time to prove their permanence. Although it was\nnot with these therapeutic uses of hypnotism that the Congress was primarily\nconcerned, some remarkable cures were recorded.\nII. Along with this fuller agreement as to the desirability of frequent\nuse of hypnotic suggestion in medical practice, went a general recognition of\nthe important fact that susceptibility to hypnotic suggestion is not in itself\nan indication of hysteria, or of any morbid condition whatever, in the sub\nject. The School of Nancy, of course, have all along been sound on this\npoint ; and the strong assertions of Dr. Bernheim were here supported by the\nexperience of the Parisian Dr. Borillon, who maintained that \" contrary to the\ncurrent opinion \" (now current in certain small groups alone) \" the difficulties\nof inducing profound trance are greater in proportion as the child presents\nmore decided traces of neuropathic heredity. \"\nIII. A third conviction to which independent experience was seen to\nhave led many observers, is that of the great importance of self-suggestiim in\nall forms of psycho-therapy. Dr. Van Eeden laid almost exclusive stress on\nwhat the patient could accomplish for himself, by resolute effort of will, if\nproperly guided and encouraged by his physician. Professor Dellxjeuf\nalso insisted that in perhaps every case the patient's cure was\neffected merely by a firmer reliance on his own powers of will ; by the\nintensification, that is to say, of a moral process entirely normal, and not\nreally dependent upon assistance from without. Carried away by his grow\ning sense of the essential power of the patient's own will, and the compara\ntive superficiality of the aid afforded by hypnotic artifice, the eminent\nprofessor of Liege went so far as to exclaim that \"all there was in hypnotism\nwas the word hypnotism itself.\"\nIV. But such a dictum is of course not a solution, but only a displace\nment of difficulties. This great and growing mass of phenomena, these new\n\fsupplementl Experimental Psychologg. Gil\npowers over the organism, these unheard-of effects for good and ill, depend\nupon something deeper than the mere invention of a name. When Prof.\nBernheim asserted that the hypnotic trance was neither more nor less than\nordinary sleep, it was well replied by Dr. Sperling that to define thus is\nsimply to add to the conception of common sleep\u2014already mysterious\nenough\u2014a number of fresh mysteries which you do nothing to explain.\nThe true meaning indeed of this refusal fairly to face the problems of\nhypnotism is that men of experience are coming to feel that those problems\ndo not really form an isolated group, but are dependent upon some deeper\nfacts in the constitution of man on which neither physiology nor psychology\nas yet feels itself prepared to enter. Nor is this chango in attitude a\nthing to be deplored. For a time, indeed, the baffled sense that we are\ndealing with forces beyond our reach may induce some barrenness in\nhypnotic discussions. But it is at least a clear gain to have arrived at a\ngeneral agreement that hypnotism, as a subject of psychological study, can\nnot be limited to the hystero-epileptic phenomena investigated at the\nSalpetriere, and to have got beyond the various crude jxasi-physiological\ndeductions of all hypnotic phenomena from hypothetical changes in cerebral\ncirculation.\nThis is not the place for any attempt to foreshadow the more comprehen\nsive views to which a wider and freer experimentation already appears to\npoint. It must be enough to say that in the region of hypnotism, as in the\nother regions which our programme of Psychical Research embraces, our\nhopes must mainly depend on the amount of actual energy with which Experi\nmental Psychology shall be pushed forward even from standpoints which at\npresent differ from our own. Just as the conquest of Gaul, which for so\nlong seemed a chimerical hope, became inevitable so soon as the Roman\nRepublic had reached a certain pitch of military force and ambition, so like\nwise when Experimental Psychology has filled its ranks and perfected its\nmethods, its bolder spirits must needs enter as conquerors the mountain-\nguarded region which we are now imperfectly surveying as pioneers of the\nscientific host.\nH.S.\nF.
