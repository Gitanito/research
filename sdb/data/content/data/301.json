He founded the Skeptics Society and its magazine Skeptic, and widely disseminates critical views on anomalous, controversial and religious topics, including parapsychology and the paranormal.&nbsp;   Contents   \tLife and Education \tWork \tSelect Awards \tCriticism and Controversy \tSeemingly Paranormal Experience \tPublications  \tSelect&nbsp;Books \tVideo   \tLiterature \tEndnotes     Life and Education\n\nMichael Brant Shermer was born on 8 September, 1954 in Los Angeles.&nbsp; He grew up in \u2018the quintessential American blended family of two half-sisters (same father, different mother), a step-sister, and two step-brothers\u2019, as he describes in a written interview, moving between two homes as he grew up.1\n\nIn high school, Shermer was \u2018born again\u2019 into the burgeoning American evangelical Christian movement, inspired by his best friend and a \u2018very dynamic and histrionic preacher\u2019. After two years of informal Christian study he entered a Christian University, Pepperdine, intending to become a professor of theology. However the requisite PhD required proficiency in Hebrew, Greek, Latin and Aramaic, surpassing his interest in languages. He changed his major to psychology and graduated in 1976.2\n\n\u2018Instead of the rhetoric and disputation of theology, there was the logic and probabilities of science,\u2019 Shermer writes, explaining the beginning of his de-conversion; he was also troubled by his religion\u2019s intolerance and hypocrisies. The final disillusionment came after his college girlfriend suffered a broken back in a car accident, and he desperately re-embraced Christianity to pray for her deliverance from paraplegia. \u2018A just and loving God who had the power to heal would surely heal Maureen,\u2019 Shermer writes. \u2018He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t, I now believe, not because \u201cGod works in mysterious ways\u201d or \u201cHe has a special plan for Maureen\u201d \u2026 but because there is no God\u2019.\n\nShermer earned his MA in experimental psychology at California State University, Fullerton, in 1978,3 then took a job as a writer for a bicycle magazine when he was unable to enter a PhD program. Inspired by his topic, he spent ten years as a serious bicycle racer and entrepreneur, keeping his hand in academia by teaching a Psychology 101 course. In 1991, he was awarded his PhD in history of science from Claremont Graduate School.4\n\nShermer gives 6 August, 1983 as the date he became a scientific sceptic, and attributes it to the failure, over years, of a plethora of unconventional health practices to heal his cycling ailments.5 He co-founded the Skeptics Society and began publishing Skeptic magazine in 1992, writing sceptical articles for major publications. He also made media appearances as a hobby. \u2018As it grew, I realized by the late 90s that I could do this full time,\u2019 he writes. \u2018Publishing magazines, writing a monthly column for such a large-circulation magazine as Scientific American, writing books, and doing television and radio shows gave me access to a much larger classroom than I could ever reach in a brick-and-mortar building\u2019.\n\nMichael Shermer lives in Altadena, California with his wife, Jennifer Graf, a native of Germany whom he married in 2014. He has one child, a daughter, Devin Ziel Shermer.  Work\n\nMichael Shermer is first and foremost a writer; though he studied experimental psychology, he does no experimental research. He contributes opinions, essays and reviews to publications as prestigious as the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, Science and Nature, and wrote a monthly column entitled Skeptic for Scientific American from April 2001 to January 2019. Shermer has also appeared on TV shows including 20\/20, Dateline, Charlie Rose, Oprah, and Larry King Live, and been interviewed in many documentaries aired on educational TV channels and networks.6\n\nShermer sought for some years to take the sceptical message onto TV with his own show, and finally landed a deal with Fox Family Channel. The series Exploring the Unknown ran for 13 hour-long episodes over 1999 and 2000, co-hosted and co-produced by Shermer. The title, he admitted, was purposely deceptive: \u2018This maximally equivocal name was chosen to as not to tip our hand to either viewers or potential guests as to the sceptical nature of the show\u2026\u20197 Segments can be found on Shermer\u2019s YouTube channel, here. A fuller list of Shermer\u2019s media appearances can be found on his website.\n\nAs well as sceptical critiques, Shermer disseminates opinions about other issues, including science in general, science and morality, the creation versus evolution debate, Holocaust denial, libertarian politics, gun control, capital punishment, racism and many more. He rejected claims of human-caused climate change until 2006 when he admitted in Scientific American that his position was no longer tenable in the face of mounting evidence.8  Select Awards\n\nShermer was awarded the Philip J Klass Award \u2018for outstanding contributions in promoting critical thinking and scientific understanding\u2019 in 2006 by the National Capital Area Skeptics, and the Isaac Asimov Award in 2001 by the New York Area Skeptics.9  Criticism and Controversy\n\nPsi researchers consider Shermer\u2019s sceptical critiques to be based on a superficial understanding, pointing to frequent factual errors and sometimes misrepresentation.10\n\nWith regard to Shermer\u2019s critique of past life research, James G Matlock writes:  \n\nMichael Shermer [2018, p. 100] maintains that \u2018one need not read deep in the literature\u2019 to see that the identification of a previous person in a reincarnation case is due to \u2018patternicity\u2014the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and random noise\u2019 (his emphasis). However, it is clear that Shermer has concluded this precisely because he has not read deeply in the literature. A reincarnation interpretation of the cases is founded on the veridical nature of the memories, behaviors, and physical signs, but rather than confronting this veridicality, Shermer and other skeptics ignore it or try to explain it away.11\n\nRupert Sheldrake writes:  \n\nIn an article in USA Today (Feb. 26, 2003) about my book The Sense of Being Stared At, And other Aspects of the Extended Mind, [Shermer] was quoted as saying, \u2018The events Sheldrake describes don\u2019t require a theory and are perfectly explicable by normal means\u2019. It turned out he could not substantiate this claim, and he admitted that he had not even seen the book. I proposed an online debate. He accepted this challenge in March 2003, and said he would \u2018get to it soon\u2019. In May that year he told me, \u2018I have not gotten to your book yet\u2019 \u2026 Apparently he never did.12   Seemingly Paranormal Experience\n\nIn October 2014, Shermer published an article in Scientific American in which he described a seemingly paranormal experience of his own. Three months earlier he had married Jennifer Graf, from K\u00f6ln, Germany. Graf had been close to her grandfather, who died when she was sixteen, and had kept some of his possessions as heirlooms, including a 1978 Philips 070 transistor radio. Shermer inserted new batteries, but could not make it work, and it was placed in the back of a desk drawer in the bedroom and forgotten. On the day of the wedding, Shermer writes,  Being 9,000 kilometers from family, friends and home, Jennifer was feeling amiss and lonely. She wished her grandfather were there to give her away. She whispered that she wanted to say something to me alone, so we excused ourselves to the back of the house where we could hear music playing in the bedroom. We don\u2019t have a music system there, so we searched for laptops and iPhones and even opened the back door to check if the neighbors were playing music. We followed the sound to the printer on the desk, wondering \u2013 absurdly \u2013 if this combined printer\/scanner\/fax machine also included a radio. Nope.\n\nAt that moment Jennifer shot me a look I haven\u2019t seen since the supernatural thriller&nbsp;The Exorcist&nbsp;startled audiences. \u201cThat can\u2019t be what I think it is, can it?\u201d she said. She opened the desk drawer and pulled out her grandfather\u2019s transistor radio, out of which a romantic love song wafted. We sat in stunned silence for minutes. \u201cMy grandfather is here with us,\u201d Jennifer said, tearfully. \u201cI\u2019m not alone.\u201d\n\nLater that night we fell asleep to the sound of classical music emanating from Walter\u2019s radio. Fittingly, it stopped working the next day and has remained silent ever since.\n\nHad this happened to someone else, Shermer continues, he might have suggested \u2018a chance electrical anomaly and the law of large numbers as an explanation \u2013 with billions of people having billions of experiences every day, there's bound to be a handful of extremely unlikely events that stand out in their timing and meaning. In any case, such anecdotes do not constitute scientific evidence that the dead survive or that they can communicate with us via electronic equipment.\u2019\n\nHe concludes:  \n\nJennifer is as skeptical as I am when it comes to paranormal and supernatural phenomena. Yet the eerie conjunction of these deeply evocative events gave her the distinct feeling that her grandfather was there, and that the music was his gift of approval. I have to admit, it rocked me back on my heels and shook my skepticism to its core as well. I savored the experience more than the explanation.13&nbsp;   Publications  Select&nbsp;Books\n\nHeavens on Earth: The Scientific Search for the Afterlife, Immortality, and Utopia. 2018, New York: Henry Holt.\n\nSkeptic: Viewing the World with a Rational Eye. 2016, New York: Henry Holt.\n\nThe Believing Brain. 2011, New York: Henry Holt\/Times Books.\n\nThe Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience.
