The remaining part of the ovum is covered\nby a membrane calledfpongy .chorion; within which 'is\nanother called true 'borion, which includes a third,\ntermed amnios. This~ontains a liquor, or watery fluid,\nin which the f~tus floatJ till the time of its birth.\nBeforethe child acquires a diftind: and regular form, it\n.is called embryo; but, &om the time all its parts become\nvifible, it takes and retains the name.off\ntetus till its\nbirth. During the progrefs of impregnation, \u2022the\nuterus fulfers confiderable changes ; but, though it\n, enlarges as the ovum increifes, yet, in regard to its '\ncontents, it is never full; for, in early geftation~ thefe\nare confined to the fundus only ; and, though the ca-\npacity of the womb increafes, yet it .is not mechani-\ncally ftretched, for the thicknefs of its fides do not di-\nminilh ; there is'a proportional increafc of the quantity\nof fluids, and therefore pretty much the fa.me thicknefs\nremains as before impregnation. The gravid uterus\nor pregnant womb is of different fizes in diffi:rent wo-\u00b7\nmen, and mufl: vary according to the bulk of the fce-\ntus and.involucra. The fituation will alfo vary accord-\ning to the increafe of its contents, and the pofition of\nthe body. For the firft two or three months, the ca-\nvity of the fundus is triangular, as before impregna-\n~on; but, as the uter':ls ftr:etches, it gradually acquires\nH2 a\nDigitized by Goo ,le\n\f-\"\"'- .\n60 M\u00b7E DIC AL MIRR 0 R.\na more rounded .fotm. In general, the uterus never\ntifes direCl:ly upwards, .but inclines alittle obliquely,\nmoft commQnly to the right fide: its pofition is.never, \u00b7\nhowever., fo oblique as to prove the fole caufe, either of\npreventing or retarding delivery ; its increafe of bulk\ndoes not feem'to arife merely from' diftention, but to ,. .\ndepend on the fame caufe and increafe as the extenfion\nof the 1kin in a growing child. 'This is ptoved from\nfome late inftances of extra-uterine fretu.fes, where the\nuterus, though -there were no contents, was nearly of\nthe fame fize, from the additional quantity of nourifh-\nmen~ tranfrnitted, as if the ovum had been contained\nwithin its cavity. The internal furface, which is ge-\nnerally pretty fmooth, except where the placenta ad-\n.heres, is lined with a tender effiorefcence of the uterus,\nwhich, after delivery, appears as if torn, and is thrown\noff' with the deanfings. This is the. membrana deci\u00b7\ndua of Dr. Hunten which he defcribes as a,Iamella\nfrom the inner furface o( the uterus; though Signior\nScarpa, Vfith more probability, confiders it as being\ncompofed Qf an infpiff~ted coagulable lymph.\nTI,.ough the uterus, f~om the moment of ooncep-\ntion, is gradually diftended, by which confiderable \u00b7\nchanges are occafioned, it is very difficult to judge of\n, pregnancy from appearances irt the early months. .for\nthe . fuft three months the os tincre feels fmooth and\neven, and its orifice as fmall as in the virgin ftate.\nWhen any difference can be perceived, abOut the fourth\ner fifth month, from the defcent of the fundus.through\nthe pelvis, the tubercle or projecting part of the os\ntinere\nDigitized by Google\n\f\\\\\nM E D I C A.

The <:er:-\nvix, which in the early months is nearly fhut, now be-\ngins to frretch and,to be diftended to the os tincre ;\nbut, during the whole term of utero-geftation, the\n~outh of the uterus.is ftrongly cemented with a ropy\nmucus, which lines it and the cervix, and begins to be\ndifcharged on the approach of1 labour. In the laft\nweek, when th~ cervix uteri is completely diftended,\n\u00b7the uteril)e orifice begins to form an elliptical tube, in-\nftead,of a fiffure, or toaffumetheappearanceof a ring\non a large globe; and often at this ,time, efpecially in\n' pendulous bellies, <iifappears entirely, fo as to be out\nof the reach of the finger in touching. Hence the os .\nuteri is not in the direetion of the axis of the womb,\nas has generally been fuppofed\u2022.\nAbout the fourth or between the fourth and fifth\n.month, the fundus uteri begins to rife above the pubes\nor brim of the pelvis, and its cervix to be difi:ended\nnearly one third. In the ~h month the belly fwells\nlike a ball, with the fkin tenfe, the fundus about half\nway between the pubes and navel, and the neck one\nhalf diftended. After the fixth month the _greateft\npart of the cervix uteri dilates, fo as to make almoft\none cavity with the fund.us. \u00b7 -In the feventh month the\nfundus advances as far as the umbilicus.

It is fuppofed to happen to\nwomen JllOl\"e' than to the females of other fpecies, \u00b7\nwhich have the fame parts, becaufe of the erect poftui:e\nof the former, and the vagina and other canals being\nperpeml~cular to the horizon; fo that the prefi\"ure of\nthe blood is direet:ed towards their orifices( whereas,.in\nbrutes, they are paralld to the horizon, and the pref-\nfure wholly is on the ftdes of thofe vefie.ls\u2022. The dif-\ncharge, he thinks, happens in this part rather than in\nany other, as being favoured more by the ftrudure of\nthe veffels ; the arteries being very numerous, and the\nveins finous and winding, and therefore more apt to\nr,etard the impetus of the blood; and confequently, in\na pl~thoric cafe, to _occafion the rupture of the extre-\nmities of the veflels, which may laft, till, by a fufficient\ndifchar:gc, the veffels are eafed of their overload. To\nthis he adds the confideration of the foft pulpous tex-\nture' of the uterus, and the. vaft number of veins and\narteries with which it is filled. Hence a healthy maid,\nbeing arrived at her growth, begins to prepare more\nnutriment than is required for the fupport of the body;\nwhich, as there is not \u00b7to be any farther accretion, muft\nof neccffity fill the veffels, and efpecially thofe of the\nuterus an(j. breafts, they being the lea.ft compreffed.\nThefe\n\fME D I C A L M I R R 0 R. 71\nThefe will.be .dilated more than the others ; \u00b7whence,\nthe late~ vafcules \u00b7evacuating their humour into.the\ncavity of the.uterus, it will. be filled and extended.\nHence a pain, heat, and heavinefs, will be felt about\nthe loins, pubes, &c. the veifels of the uterus, at the\nfame\u00b7 time, will be fo dilated as to emit bfood in the\n.cavity of the _\nuterus, and its mouth will be -lubricated\nand loofened, and blood iifue out.

The liquor he thinks well\n~dapted to raife a fermentation in the blood, when dif-\ncharged into it in quantity; and, as itis contained in a\nreceptacle that does not admit of a continual ifl\"ue, it\n\u00b7may be there referved, till in a certain period of time\nthe bladder becoming turgid and full, through the com-\npreffion of the\u00b7 incumbent vifcera, it emits the gall;\nwhich, by the way of the laC\\:eals, infinuating itfelfin..\nto the blood, may raife that effervefcence which occa-\nftons the aperture of the uterine arteries.

The\nheft method of regimen is laid down in my Family\nPhyftcian, page '21.7> which, if weHobferved; in addi-\ntion to the following courfe, will generally perform a.\ncure. Take leaves of mugwort, briony, and penny-\nroyal, of each an handful ; infufe them four. days in\n\u00b7two quarts of foft water, and then pour off the clear \u00b7\nliquor for ufe. Take a gill-glefs.three parts full, with\nthirty drops of the LuNAR TINCTURE added to it,\nthree\u00b7times a day, viz. morning, noon, and night, till\nthe decodioh be all ufed. Then reduce the dofe to\ntwenty drops of the Tindure in a\u00b7wine-glafs of cold\nfpring-water morning and evening, for fifteen days;\nafter which it fhould be taken only once a day, or every ,\nother day, until'the patient finds herfelf entirely free\n&om every fymptom 'of thedi(eafe. For this malady,\nit is the only fpecific hitherto known ; .it-unclogs the\ngenital tuhes, purges and cools the uterus and vagina, .\npromotes the menftrual difcharge, cleanfes the urinary\npa1fages, diffolves vifcid humours in the blood, fhatp-\nens the appetite, ft~mulates the nerves, and invigorates\nthe fpirits, which fo all ftages of cblorofis are fo apt to\nhe depreffed.

The following is\na literal ftatement of the\nCA S E. \u2022 \u00b7\nA young lady, tumedof feventeen, had been afilided\nwith chlorojis almofl: three years. In the early part of\nthe malady, fhe conceived an unconquerable appetite\nfor wood..cinders, concreted morta'r,_tobacco-pipes,\nfealing-wax, &c. Her courfes appeared at different\nintervals of the difeafe, but always irregular, and more\nor lefs in,a vitiated fl:ate. About half a year preceding\nmy attendance, this flux had totally ceafed ; but, upon .\nthe approach of every new moon, with which her men..\nfes originally came, fhe was \u00b7affiicted with pains in the.\nback and Joins, heavinefs and turgidity about the region.\nof the womb, and other cufl:omary fymptoms of the\ncatamenia ; yet not the fmalleft fhow could be brought\nto appear. A little\u00b7 before this, the lady's atTeetion1\n\u00b7 had been placed on a young man in the neighbourhood,\nbut ~hofe fituation in life was by no means on a fcalc\nadapted to the views of her father and family. Th\u2022\nmoment therefore this attachment was difcovered, th&\nlady was confinedto her apartment, and neither fuffered\nto take exercifeor frefh air, but when it fuited forfome \u00b7\ntrufty attendant to accompany her. This confinement\u00b7\nlteightened her difeafe, and brought on afettled melan-\n~holy, a green fallow complexion, dejeeted fpirits, uni-\nverfal laffitude, and wailing of the fiefh. The mor-\nbid \u00a3-l:ate of her body having thus undermined her\n. c:onftitution, without attraeting eitl+er her own or her\nL ~ f~er\"a\nDigitized by Google\n-----.-...-\n..\n\f'\"\"'\n84 M E D I CA L M I R 1t 0 Jt.\nfather's care, the diforder fell upon.the vital organs,\nand with {o rapid a.progrefs, that within twenty-four\nhours ihe was feized with an ardent fever, attended with\nlofs of appetite, delirium, and a total privation of\n(peech. In this lhock.ing fl:ate fhe had .the alternate\nadvice of three phyficians of the firft re(pedability ;\nbut the di(order increafing, and putting on the moft:\ndangerous fymptoms, after having bafBed their utmoft:\nfkill, a confultation was had, and the miferable patient\nwas configncd, to the.grave.\nUnder thefe deplorable circumfl:ances it was my .lot\nto be called in; and, upon a clofe examination of the\npatient, fcarccly any viftble ftgns of life remained.\nThe pul(e had nearly fubfided. The ad:ion of the\nheartand lungs could fcarcely be difcemed. The eyes\nwere funk, and fixed; yet retained an uncommonlook\nof exprdlion and fentiment. At this time fhe had a\nlarge blifter round her neck, another on the pit of her\nftomach ; a third, very large, between her fhoulders ;\na fourth on her head; a fifth, and ftxth, infide the an-\nc,\nles and legs. Venefed:ion had been fo often.repeated,\nthat fcarce blood enough rem,aincd to fupport the heat\nand ad:ion of the heart. In this exhaufl:ed fl:ate, I\nonly adminiftered three tahle-fpoonfuls of the Solar\nTind:ure, ttndiluted, at intervals of little more than an'\nhour apart; and, in the fpace of four hours after, I had\nthe heart-felt fatisfad:ion of feeing the energy of the\nblood reftored ; pulfation gradually refurned its aaion;\u00b7\nthe lungs were dilated ; refpiration became free ; and\n;i profufe fweat, which the Tinelure ind.peed, fo~-\n'\u00b7\n...\nnately\nDigitized by G<??Sle\n__,;..., ;- _.\n.....~\n;..;,;\n- ~\n;;..;.\n- --\n\f\u2022\n\u2022\nMEDICAL MIRROR\u2022\n\u2022ately opened the perfpiratory vefi\"els ; and the patient\nbegan to give evident ftgns of eafe and fenfibility.\u2022\nWarm nourilhing food was afterwards taken in fm~\nquantities; and I was.enabled to remove the blifters,\nand perform the dreffmgs, without pain or torture to\n, the languid patient. The Solar TinCl:ure was now ad..\nminiftered every day for ten days, in the \u00b7quantity of\na table-fpoonful in a wine-glafs of warm barley-wa-\nter, three times a day, and once in the night, whenever\nwatchfulnefs came on. About the middle of the fe.\nventh day, Che began to articulate, though not a word\nhad been uttered for upwards of foe weeks before;\nand on the ,,tenth day, her voice and bodily funtl:ions\nwere fo far reft:ored, that I deemed it fafe to give her\nan interval of fix days reft, without any medicine what.\never. I had the happinefs to pnd my expetl:ations\ncompletely anfwered; for nature, affifted by nouri1hing\nfood, eff'etl:ed more than a profufton of drugs ; fo that,\nin little more than twenty days, my patient was able to\nwalk her room, and to put herfelf under a '9\\lne of\nthe Lunar T inCl:ure. \u00b7This Che perftfted in, with\nnourifhing diet, feconded by occafional but very gentle\nairings in the carriage, for near a month longer; when,\non the approach of the enfuing new moon, to the un\u00b7\nfpeakablejoy of her friends, the menftrual flux refumed\nits natural courfe : the comfort and relief of which\nwas fo vifible tO the patient, that .(he in ecftacy exclaim-\ned, \" myfafferings are at an end.\" This lady has ever\nftnce continue<! to improve in health and fpirits in fo\nfurpriftng a d~gree, that, looking hack on her late mi-\nJ ferable\nDigitized by Google\n\f16 M E D I C A L M I R R 0 R.\nferable and reduced fbte of body, forms a contraA: {o\ngreat as almoft to exceed belief. Yet the iady and her\nworthy parent, are ~ a:ll times ready to authenticate\nthe faet, to any reputable enquirer, or to the friends of\nany unfortunate female labouring under a; ftr\u00b5ilar af..\nflietion.\nOr THE FLUOR ALBUS, OR WHITES.\nThe fluor albus, female weaknefs, or whites, as it\nis commonly called, is a difeafe of the womb and its\ncontiguous parts; from which a pale-coloured;,green\u2022\nilh, or yellow, fluid, is difcharged, attended with lofs of\nftrength, pain in the loins, ba.d\u00b7digeftion, \u00b7and a wan\nfickly afpeet. The quantity, colour, and conftftence,\nof the difcharge, chiefly depend upon the time of its\nduration, the patient's habit of body, and the nature\n()f the caufe by which it was produced. weakly\nwomen of lax folids, who have had many child!en, and\nlong\u00b7laboured under ill h!!alth, are of all the\u00b7moft fub~\njeCl: to this difagreeable difeafe ; from which they un-\nfurtunately fuffer more fevere penance than others, as\nthe niceft fenfations are often conneCl:ed with fuch a de-\nlicacy of bodily frame as fubjeCl:s them to it. In_Hol~\nland if is very frequent, and in a manner peculiar to the:\nplace, from the darnpnefs of its fttuation ; the- fur-\niounding air being fo overcharged with moifture as to\nrelax the body, ftop perfpiration, and throw it. upon\nthe bowels Or womb ; producing in the firft a diarrhrea-\nor flux, in the laft the fiuor albus or female weakne{S.\nThe difcharge often proceeds from the ve1fels fubfer-\nvient\nDigitized by Google\nJ\n\u2022\u2022\nl\nJ\n\fM E D I C A L M I R R 0 R. 87\n'fientto menfuuation; becaufe; in delicate habits, where\nthofe veffels are weak; and confequently remain too long\nuncontra~ed, the fluor albus fometimes immediately '\nfollows the menfes, and goes off by degrees as they.\ngradually clofe. It alfo comes from the mucus glands\nof the womb, as is particularly evident in very young\nfemales of eight or ten years old; in whom, though\nvery rarely, it has been obferved, and where it muft\nthen neceffarily have efcaped from thofe parts, as the\nuterine veffels are not fufficiently enlarged for its paf-\nfage at fo early a period.\nSometimes, as in women with- child, it proceeds\nfrom the\u00b7paffage to the womb, and not from the womb\n' itfelf; which, during pregnancy, is clofely fealed up,\nfo that nothing can pafs from thence till the time of\nlabour. The 'application of thofe inftruments called\npeffaries, from the pain and irritation they occafion,\nare alfo apt to bri~1g on this difcharge. The fluor albus\nhas been fuppofed to fupply the want of the menfes \u00bb\n\u00b7 b~caufe, where the firft prevails, the laft ar~ gener.\u00b5ly\neither irregular or totally wanting: but it might more\nproperly be faid, that the prefence of the fluor albus,\nwhich is a preternatural evacuation, oetafions .the a.b-\nfence of that which is natural ; as is evident from the\nreturn of the menfes after the fluor albus has been\ncured. Indeed, when this difcharge appears about the\nage of thirteen or fourteen, and returns once a month,\nwith fymptoms like thofe of menfes, then it may be\ndeemecl ftricHy natural, and therefore ought n9t to be\nil:opped. The fluor albus m,ay bediftinguifued into two\nkinds.\nDigitized by <;;oog!l\n\fSS MEDICAL MIRROR.\nkinds. The firft arifes from a fimple wcaknefs; or the\nrelaxation of the folids ; which may either be general,\nwhere the whole bodily. fyftem is enervated and un..\nfuung ; or partial, where the womb Qnly is alFeaed,\nin confequence of hard labour, frequent mifcarriages,.\nfuppreff10n or ~moderate quantity of the menfes, or\na ftrain of the back and loins. In the firft cafe, the\ndifcharge being generally mild, may be~eaftly taken\naway. In the fecond, it may proceed from a vitiated\nor impure blood, where the body, from thence, isloaded\nwith grofs humours~ which nature for her own fecurity .\nand relief thus endeavours to carry off. Infuch cafes,\nthe difcharge is often of a reddifh colour, like that from\nold ulcerous fores ; being fometimes fo 1harp as to ex\u2022\ncoriate the contiguous\u00b7parts, .and \u00b7occafion a fmarting\nand heat of urine. A deep-feated darting pain, wfth\na forcing down, 'attending fuch a difcharge, is a very\n\u00b7dangerous and alarming fign, and indicates an ulcerated\nor cattcerous womb. This malignant fta~e of the dif-\neafe, if of long continuance, is\u00b7 extr7mely difficult of \u00b7\n\u00b7cure ; and difpofes the patient to b~rennefs, a bearing\ndown, dropfy, or confumption. In fhort,; as this is a\nmalady of the moft difagreeable kind, which by long\ncontinuance or negleCl:: becomes difficult 9f cure, and\noften proves fatal, it were to be wi1hed that women, on\nfuch occaficms, would be more attentiv~ to their own\nfafety, by uftng all poffible means, in due time, to pre-\nvent the diforder.\nAs women are fometimes conneCl::ed with thofe who\nd.o not confcientioufly regard their fafety, it is a cir-\ncumftance\ni\nDigitized byGoogle I\n\fM\u00b7E D I C A L M I R R 0 R\u00bb 8~\ncumtlance of the utmoft confequence to\u00b7dHtinguUh a\nfrelh venereal infeetion from,the B.uor albus or whites:\nfor, if the fir.fl: be miftaken for the la.ft, and be either\nnegleeted or improperly treated, the woril confequence$\nmay arife. In addition therefore to what I have ftated\nin page z19 of my Family PhyficiaJ_t, the following\nfigns will ferve to inform the patient whe~r there be.\noccafion for her d9ubts or not. A frefu infeaion, called\ngonnorrhcea, is malignant and inflammatory; the fluor\nalbus moft commc;mly arifes from relaxation and bodily\nweaknefs : and therefore the remedies proper in the .\nfirft diforder would render the laft more violent; by\nlocking up and confining the infeetious matter. Li\nthe gonorrhcea, the difcharge chiefly proceeds from the\nparts contiguous.to the urinary pa.B'age, and continues\n. whilft the menfes How ; butin the fluor albus it is fup-\nplied from the cavity of the womb and its pafTage,\nand then the menfes are feldom regular. .In the go...\nnorrhcea, an itching, inflammation, and heat of urine,\nare the fore-runners of the difcharge ; the orifice of\nthe urinary pa1fage is prominent, and the patient is af...\nfeeted \u00b7with a frequent irritation to make water. In the\nfl.uor albus, pains in dte loins, and lofs of ftrcngth, at-.\ntend the difcharge ; and, if any inflammation or heat\nof urine follow, they hap,Pen in a lefs degree, and only\nafter a long continuance of the difcharge, which, be_..\ncoming fuarp and acdmonious, excoriates the fw:rowid-\ning ~arts. ln the gonorrh~a, the difcharge fuddenly\nappears, without any ev..ident caufe; but in the auw\nalbus, it comes on more llowly, and is of~'pr~uced.\n~ by\nDigitized by Google\n\f\"' . \u00b7 ME DI C A t M I R R 0 R.\nby irregula~es of the menfes, frequent abortion,\narains1 or Jong-continued'illnefs.

Another arQ'.ument is drawn\n....\nby.Mr. Hunter from a cafe of a fractured os humeri.\nA \u00b7man was brought into St. George~s Hofpital for a\nfimple fracture of the os humeri or arm, and died about\na month after the accident. . As the bones had not\nunited, Mr. Hunter injected the arm after death. He\nfound that the cavi~y \u00b7between the extremities of the\nbones was filled up with blood which Jtad coagulated.\nThis blood was become vafcular, orfull of vetfels. In\nfome places it was very much fo. He does not main-\ntain that all coagulated blood becomes vafcular : ~d\nindeed the reafon is obvious ; for it is often thrown\nout and'. coagulated in parts where its becoming vafcu-\niar cow.d anfwer no end in the fyfl:em : as, for example,\nin the cavities of aneurifmal facs. If it be fuppofed,\n, that, in 1uch cafes as \u00b7that jufl: now mentioned, the\nvetrels,are not formed in the coagulum, but come from\nthe neighbouring arteries, it is equally an argument\nthat the blood is alive : for the fubftance into which\nve1fe1s flioot muA: be fo.

The quantity of this difcharge\nwas.different at different times, varying from one pint\nto two pints and a half in twenty-four hours., As to\u00b7\nits quality, it feemed to be no other than the ordinary\nfecretion of the falival glands. By fo large and con-\nftant an evacuation, her fuength became extremely\nimpaired, and the moft efficacious medicines had proved\nufelefs. She had taken large quantities of the P,eru-\nvian bark, both alone and combined with preparations\nof iron: and afterwards the fetid gums, opium, am-\nber, alum, and the Neville-Holt-water, had in fuc-\nceffion been given her. .In the mean time an exa8: re-\ngimen had been prefcribed.: fue had been ordered to\nride conftantly; and to confine herfelf to a mucilagi-\n. nous diet, fuch as veal, calves' feet, &c.

But all thefe attempts\nhad been vain ; and after 1he had taken fome or other\n\u00b7of the medicines above mentioned until the end of\n\u00b7September, 1753, namely, a.hove two years, it appeared\nto her phyftcian, Sir George Baker, unreafonable to\nexped relief in fuch a cafe from any internal medicines\nwhatever. He now conceived a fu(picion, that fome\nextraneous body, having accidentally found its way\ninto the meatus auditoritts, might poffibly be the caufe\nof this extraordinary fecretion, by keeping up a conti-\nnued irritation in the parotid glands. With this view\nhe examined her ears, and extraded from them a quan-\ntity of fotid wool. How, or when, it came thither,\n\u00b7no account .could be given. To this fubilance he at-\ntributed the beginning of the falivation, notwithftand-\n~ng that the difeafe did not immediately abate on the\nremoval of the wool ; as it appeared to be no impro-\nbable fuppofttion that the difcharge might be continued\nby the force ,of habit, though the original caufe no\nlonger remained. It feemed therefore expedient to\nintroduce fome other habit, in the place of the increafed\nfecretion of faliva ; which habit might :lften\\'.ards be\ngradually left off. With this intention, he prevailed\non the patient to chew perpetually a little dry bread,\nand to fwallow it with her fpittle. In a few weeks, it\nbecame necefrary for her to chew the bread only at cer-\ntain hours in the day,; and thus, after two motiths, 1he\nbecame entirely free from a moft difguftful and tedious\ndiforder.---It is worthy of o~fervation, that, at nrft,\n3 the\nDigitized by Google\n\f' \u00b7-\n1sz M E D I C A L M I R R 0 ll~\nthe fwallowing of fo much faliva frequently occafioned\na naufea; and that then, for \u00b7a few hours, fhe w~s\nobliged to fpit it out as ufual ; and that, during the\ngreatefr part of the time when fhe ~hewed the bread,\nfile had a ff:ool or two every day more than common.\nTABES DoRSALIS, OR CoNsuMPTION OF THE BACK.\nA young gentleman, twenty-two years of age, ap\u00b7 \u00b7\nplied to me in the above diforder, which had worn\nhim down to a mere fkeleton.

It is very remarkable that thefe\npatients have not only a dread of water, but of -every\nthing bright\u00b7or tranfparent. Soon after this atfetl:ion\ntakes place, the mind becomes impaired ; which fuew~\nthat the poifon is carried through the blood to the ner-\nvous fluid, a:nd thence tothe brain. Dr. Jam.es, in his\nTreatifc on Canine Madnet5, mentions. a boy fent out\nto fill two botcles with water, who was fo terrified by\n_the_ noife of the liqqid running into them, that he fled\ninto the houfe crying out that he was bewitched.

Nay, the bare fight o( water, of a looking\u00b7\nglafs, or any thing clear or pellucid, will give the ut\u00b7\nmoft uneafinefs, and even throw the patient into con-\nvulfions. In this difeafe there (eems to be an extreme \u00b7\nfenftbility and irritability of the J\\ervous fyftem. The\neyes cannot bear the light, or the fight of any thing\n\u00b7 white; the 1eaft touch or motion oft\"ends them, and\n. .\nthey want to be kept as quiet and in as dark a place\nas poffible. Some complain of the coldnefs of the\nair, frequently when it is really warm. Others com.\nplain of violent heat ; and have a great defire for cold\nair, which yet never fails to increafe the fymptoms. In\nall there is a great flow of the faliva intQ the mouth ~\nwhich is exceedingly troublefome to the patients, as it\nhas the fame eff'ed: upon their fauces that other liquids\nhave. This therefore they perpetually blow off'.with\nviolence, which in a patient of Dr. Fothergill's occa-\nfioned a noife not unlike the hollow barking of a dog,\nand which he conjed:ures might have given rife to the\ncommon notion that hydrophobious patients bark like\ndog.s. They have an infatiable thirft; but are .unable\nto get down any drink, except with the utmoft diffi-\nculty; though fometimes they canfwallow bread foak-;\ncd in liquids, ilices of oranges, or other fruits. There\n:is a p~ under theftro\/Jiculus cordis, as in the tetanus;\nand the patients mournfully point to that place as the\nfeat of the difeafe. Dr. Vaughan is of.opinion that it\nis this pain, rather than any difficulty in fwallowing.\nwhich diftreff'es the patient on every attempt to drink.\nThe voice is commonly plaintive and mournful; but\nDr.\nDigitized by Google\n\f.M E D I C A L M I R R 0 R. 161\n'\nDr:Vaughan tells us there is a mixture of ficrcenefa\n,and timidity in the countenance which he cannot \u00b7de-\nfcribe, but by which he could know a hydrophobious\nperfon without afking any queftions. Some feem to\n.have at times a furious delirium, and an inclination to\nfpit at or bite th~ by-ftanders; while others fhew no\nfuch inclination~ but will even fuffer people to wipe the\ninfide of their mouths with the corner of a handker- \u00b7\n\u00b7chief in order to clear away the vifcid faliva which is\nready to fuffocate them. In fome male patients thery\nis an involuntary ereetion of the penis, and emiffion of\nthe femen ;- and the urine is forced away by the fre-.:.\nquent return of the fpafms.- In a letter from Dr..\nWolf, of Warfaw, to ljenry Baker, F. R. S. dated\nWarfaw, September 26, 1767, we have the following\nmelancholy account\u00b7 of the cafes of five perfons who\ndied of the hydrophobia :--~None of them quite loft\ntheir fenfes; but they were all talking\u00b7 without inter-\nmiffion, praying, lamenting, defpairing, curling, ftgh-\n.ing, \u00b7fpitting a. frothy\u00b7 faliva, fcreeching, fometimes\n\u00b7belching, and retching, but rarely vomiting. Every\nmember is convulfed by fits, but moil: violently from\nthe .navel up to the breaft and refophagus. The fit\ncomes on every quarter of an hour; the fauces are not\n.red, nor the tongue dry. The pulfe is not at all fever.;.\nifh ; and when the fit is over nearly like a found pulfe.\nThe face grows pale, then brown,.and durih.g the fit\nalmoft black; the lips livid; the head is drowfy, and\nthe ears tingling ; the urine li.mpid. Atlaft they grow\nweary ;\u00b7 the fits are lefs violent, .and ceafe towards the\n~ \u00b7\u00b7 end1\n\u00b7\n.\n.

They compofe themfelves quietly as if\nto gct'ileep, and fo they expire. A general obferva-\ntion was, that the lint and dreffings of the wounds,\neven when dry, were always black, and that when the\u00b7\npus was very good in colour and appearance. In one\nof Dr. Wolf's patients who recovered, the blood frank\n\u00b7intolerably as it was drawn from a vein ; and one of\n.Dr. Vaughan's patients complained of an intolerable\nfa,tidfmell proceedin\"g from the wounded part, though\nmbody but.himfelf could perceive it. In general, the\nYiolent convulfions ceafe \u00b7a fhort time before death ;\nand even the hydrophobia goes off, fo that the patients\ncan drink freely. But this does not always happen ;\nfor Dr. Vaughan mentions the cafe of a patient, in\n:'Whom, \" when he had in appearance ceafed to breathe,\nthe fpafmus cynicus was obfervable, with an odd con-\n.wlftve motion in the mufcles of the face ; and the\nArangc contrariety which took place in the adion of\nthefo produced the moA: horrid affemblage of features\nthat can well be conceived. Of this patient alfo it .\nwas remarkable, that in the IaA: hours of his life he\u00b7\nce;Ued to call for drink, which had been his conftant\nrequeft ; \u00b7but was perpctually afking for fomething to\ncat.\"\nThe hydrophobia feems to be a fymptom peculiar\nto the human race; for the mad animals which com-\nmunicate the infcd:ion do not feem to have any di-ea4\n,Gf-Water. Notwithtlanding this, dipping is the com-\nmon\n\fM E D I C A.L M l R R 0 R. i63\nmon remedy for the cure of dogs and men. Wit1'\n, regard to the fymptoms of madnefs in dogs, they are\nvery equivocal ; and thofe particularly enumerated by\nfome authors, are only fuch as might be exped:ed in\ndogs much heated or agitated by being violently pur-\nfued and ftruck. One fyrnptom indeed, if it couJd be\ndepended\u00b7upon, would determine the matter; namely,\nthat all other dogs avoid and run away from one that\nis mad; and even large dogs will not attack one of the\nfmalleft fize who is infe~ed with this difeafe. Upon\nthis fuppofition they point out a methodofdifcovering\nwhether a dog that hath been killed '!'38.really mad ot\nnot; namely, by rubbing a piece of meat along the\ninn~~ of his mouth, and then offering it to a found\ndog, If the latter eats it, it is a ftgn the dog was not\nmad ; hut, if the other rejeds it with a kind of howl-\ning :noife, it is certain that he was. Dr. James tells\nus, that among <logs the difeafe is infea:iOQS by ftayiDg\nin the fame place; and that after a kennel has becn\nonce infeded, the dogs put into it will be for a corm-\nderable time afterwards in danger of going mad alfo.\nA remedy for this, he fays is, to keep geCfe for ~\ntime inthe kennel.

It is certain alfo, that the it;ifect:ion has been\ncommunicated by the bites of dogs, ~ats, wolves, foxes,\nweafels, fwine, and even cocks and hens, when in a ftate\nof madnefs. But it does nQt appear that the diftem-\nper is communicable from one hydrophobious perfon\nto another, by means of the bite, or any other way.\n\u2022 It has been generally allowed by praetitioners, that,\nthough.the hydrophobia may be prevented, yet it\u00b7 can\u00b7\nfeldom be cured after it has made its appearance. The\nmoft effential part of the treatment therefore depends\non an immediate ufe of the proper means of preven-\ntion. For this purpofe fome advife the inftant cutting\nout the part bitten, which muft certainly be an effeCl:ual\nmode, provided we could be fore the poifon had not\nreached beyond thewound. When, however, we con-\nfider the rapidity with which the blood andjuices flow,\nit feems impoffible we can ever wholly depend on fuch.\nan operation.

W.ith us, therefore, life continues, until\nfuch feparation has really taken place; which can no\nmore be faid\u00b7to have happened during the paroxifm of\na fit, or of a blow which for a time deprives us of.\nfenfation, or in the early period of an unnatural or fu.d\u00b7.,\nden death, than\u00b7during ~e time we are afleep\u2022 . .It is\nthe want of proper fkill at fuch times that too often\n\u00b7occafions Cleath to take place, when life abfolutely ex-\nifts in the blood, arid might with litde care have been\npreferved. Death is therefore the aa of feparation <)f\nthe foul from the body ; in which feqfo it ft~ds op-\npofed to life, which confifts in the union thereof. An\na.nimal body> by the aaions\u00b7 infeparable from life, .U.tr-\ndergoes a continual change, and receives its dilfqlu~i~\nby degrees~ Its fmalleft fibres become rigid ; it~ mi-\u00b7\n\u00b7\u00b7 nuter velfels grow into folid fibres no longer perviou~\nto the fluids ; its greater velfels grow hard and n~-\n.row; and every thing becomes contraa:ed, clofed, and \"\u00b7\nbound up: 'Y.h~nce the drynefs, immobility, and\u00b7 ex-\ntenuation, obferved m old age.\u00b7 \u00b7By fuch means the\nY offices\nDigitized by Google\n\f.\nt\nI\n~70 \u00b7 M E D I C A L M I R R. 0 R.\nolices of the\u00b7minuter ve&ls are de4lroyed ; the \u00b7hu..\n~rs A:agnate, harden, and at length coalefce with the\nfolids. \u2022 .Thus are the fubtileft fluids in the body in-\ntercepted and loft, the concO\\.'l:ion weakened, and the\nreparation prevented ; only the bfpod c~ntinues to run\nfiowly through the greater vefi\"els, affiduous to preferve .\nJife, even after die animal fuRctions are delhoyed.

They then\u00b7 ftruc~\nilown one of the lhovels on his neck, with an evident delign to fever\nthe head from the body ; but, llriking againfi the bone, it bad not\nthe intended effect. Now it is a moft extraordinary circumfiance,\nattefted by feveral witneffes on the trial of thefe inhuman wretch~\u00b7s,\nwho were convicted of the murder at the enfuing Winchefier affi-\nzes, and executed on the 4th of Auguft, 1794, that Mr. Ground-\nwater lived eighteen hours after he had received the above gr.ievous\nwounds, and after the whole of the brain had fallen out of the ca-\nvity of the fcull. He was entirely fpeechlefs ; but the aCtion of\nthe pulfe was remarkably ftrong, and refpiration vifibly continued,\nduring the whole of the eighteen hours above-mentioned, This\n~as pofitively attefted. on the oath of Mr. Hill, the furgeon w~o\nattended him, and taken down as a mofi fingular cafe, by.Sir Nalh\nG~ofe, who tried the prifoners. This fact therefore clearly decides\ntht> lorg-contefied point among phyfiologifis, whether the feat of\nlife is in the heart, or in the brain? for it evidently lhews that th~\nlife is in the blood, feated in its grand refervoir.the heart, which if\never fo flightly wounded or impaired, the circulation cea{es, an<!\ndeath infiantly \u00a39llow~.\nDigitized by Google\n.- - --::;:.__....__,,__-~---=,,,..\n\f'MED IC AL MIRR 0 R. 173\nits circulation be fufpended or deftroyed, death f~\nlows.

Therefore it imports us much to pre-\nferve and improve the habit of its.e~joyment, withou~\nwhich every other external entertainment is taftelefs,\nand moll other advantages are of little .avail. To this\nend, we ought above all things to cultivate prudence,\ntemperance, fobriety, fortitude,. and equanimity of\ntemper j for without aprudent care of the body, and\na fteady government of the mind, to guard the one\nfrom difeafe, and the other from the feuds of paffion\nand prejudice, found health is unattainable.
