He had passed through\nan unusually laborious term's work at the Owens College, but appeared\nperfectly well and in good spirits when he left his friends in Manchester\nto join his family in Ireland. At the aeath of his uncle he had\niD.herited, a year or two ago, a pretty country residence, with some 500\nacres of ground, at Ballymagarvey, near Drogheda; here he spent his\nvacations, which, however, were merely change of scene without the\nmuch-needed relaxation of his work.\nOn Saturday, December 17th, he arrived at his Irish home, and on\nSunday, without any apparent caus~xcept perhaps that he had a\nsomewhat rough passage a.crOBB the Channel-a sudden effusion of\nblood OB the brain took place, which proved fatal in a few hours. At\nhis funeral the Senate of the Victoria University, and the Professors\nand Students of Owens College were represented by Professor Osborne\nReynolds, Professor T. H. Core, and Mr. Haldane Gee. The Physical\nSociety, of which Professor Stewart was President at the time of his\ndeath, was represented by Professor G. F. Fitzgerald and ProfeBBOr\nW. F. .Barrett, the last-named also representing the Society for\nPsychical Research. Professor Balfour Stewart was also President\nof the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, and a\nFellow of nump,rous scientific societies.\nProfessor Stewart was born in Edinburgh on November 1st, 1828,\nso that he had only entered on his 60th year at the time of his\ndeath. In his youth he studied at the Universities of St. Andrew's and\nEdinburgh, and became assistant to the Professor of Natural Philosophy\nin Edinburgh University. Devoting himself with enthusiasm to\nR\nDigitized by Google\n\f198 JO'I.II1\"TULl of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1888.\nmeteorology, he was appointed Director of the Kew Observatory in 1859.\nIn 1870 he received the appointment of Professor of Physics in the\nOwens College, and on his way to Manchester to undertake the duties\nof his chair he met with a frightful railway accident at Harrow. From\nthe effects of this terrible collision he never fully recovered, being\npermanently lamed and passing in a few months from the prime of life\nto grey-headed old age. But, as Professor Tait truly remarks in\nNature, in spite of this awful blow, his characteristic patience was\nunruffled. Happily his intellect remained unimpaired.\nIn 1862 he was elected a. Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1868\nreceived the Rumford medal from that society for his remarkable and\nimportant discoveries in Radiant Heat. Later on, the University of\nEdinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D., and from\nnumerous home and foreign scientific societies he received marks of\ndistinction.\nThe amount of work Professor Stewart accomplished from the time\nof his appointment in Manchester was most remarkable. In addition\nto the duties of his chair, he wrote his famous Treatise on Heat, which\nis still the standard work on this subject; his admirable Les80ns on\nPhysic8 in Macmillan's series; his Elementary Physic8 for beginners\nand, in conjunction with Mr. Gee, an excellent handbook on Practical\nPhysic8. Besides these he wrote a popular work on the Oonservation\nof Energy, a lengthy and exhaustive article on \"Terrestrial\nMagnetism\" in the new edition of the Encyclopredia Britannica, and, in\nconjunction with Professor Tait, the well-known work on the Unseen\nUniver8e. The twelve editions through which this last-named book\nrapidly passed are sufficient evidence of the profound interest it excited\nand the general a.ppreciation with which it was regarded by the public.\nPararlorcical Philosophy, the companion volume, by the same authors,\nwhich followed, did not excite the same widespread interest, though it is\na work that deserves to be more generally read, and doubtless would be\nif it had not been written in. the tiresome form of dialogue. All this\nliterary work, together with numerous original memoirs to scientific\nsocieties, was only possible to a 'man of most methodical habits, and of\nindefatigable labour, and these were eminently Professor Stewart's\ncharacteristics. He had, moreover, a simple- hearted and lovable\nnature, which endeared him to all his friends.\nLike Faraday, Clerk Maxwell, Stokes, and other eminent men of\nscience, -Stewart found scientific knowledge oonsistent with a humble\nChristian faith. In fact, the object of his work on the Un8een Uniwrse,\nand of more recent efforts in which he was engaged, was to establish the\nfact that Christianity rightly regarded, was not inconsistent with, but\nthe only intelligible solution of, the profounder problems of physical\nDigitized by Google\n\f\u00b7 Ja.n., 1888.] JO'U'ffl(1,l Of Society for Psychical Research. 199\nscience. Whilst a cautious and careful investigator, he was also an\nintrepid thinker, and has led the van in some of the most abstruse and\ndifficult regions of physical and metaphysical inquiry. Of his services\nto our Society, it is needless to speak; they are fresh in the memory of\nus all, and testify to his courageous devotion to truth.\nThe following extract from the obituary notice of Professor\nBalfour Stewart which appeared in Nature will be read with interest,\nas it is from the pen of the distinguished Professor of Physics in the\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Professor P. G. Tait:-\n\" In the genial Manchester Professor the scientific world has lost not\nonly an excellent teacher of physics, but one of its ablest and most original\ninvestigators. He was trained according to the best methods of the last\ngeneration of experimentalists, in which scrupulous accuracy w&s constantly\nassociated with genuine scientific honesty. Men such as he are never\nnumerous; but they are the true leaders of scientific progress: dit'ectly,\nby their own contributions, indirectly, though (with rare exceptions) even\nmore substantially, by handing on to their students the choicest tradition.\nof a past age, mellowed by time and enriched from the experience of the\npresent. The name of Stewart will long be remembered for more than one\nstriking addition to our knowledge; but his patient and reverent spirit will\ncontinue to impress for good the mind and the work of all who have come\nunder its infiueBce.\"\nIn conclullion, Professor Tait adds a personal testimony, which the\nwriter of this notice can heartily endorse :-\n\" Of the man himself I cannot trust myself to speak. What I could\nsay will easily be divined by those who knew him intimately; and to those\nwho did not know him I am unwilling to speak in tenns which, to them,\nwould certainly appear exaggerated.\"\nW. F. B.\nSPURIOUS MEDIUMSHIP.\nBy S. J. DAVEY.\nOn September 30th, 1887, the Newcastle Daily Chronicle, and the\nNewcastle Daily Leader, contained reports of a private view of \"Slate-\nwriting,\" given by a person calling himself\" Mr. Wilson.\" From a\ncareful perusal of these reports, it would be difficult to form any other\nconclusion than that the phenomena of Mr. Wilson, \"the most\nrenowned psychographic medium of America,\" are identical with the\ntricks of Dr. Henry Slade. That Dr. Slade should have elected to visit\nEngland under a disguised name is not surprising, when past circum-\nstances in his history are taken into consideration. Apart from the\nprosecution by Professor Ray Lankester at Bow-street Police-court,\nthere are other records connected with his career that seriously\ncompromise his pretensions to \"mediumship.\"\nR 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f200 JouT'nal of Society for P8ychical Research. [Jan., 1888.\nIn 1883, accordini to the Belleville (Ontario) Intelligencer, Dr.\nHenry Slade was exposed in a most complete manner, and the mark of\nhis guilt in the shape of a prepared slate was retained by his expOllers.\nHe then confessed his crime, subsequently pleading, however, that \"the\ngentlemen had made him drunk.\" On being a.llowed to leave the town\nof Belleville, and having made good his escape, he circulated a report\nthat the exposure had not taken place with the genuine Dr. Slade, bllt\nwith some one falsely bearing his name.\nThe New York Sunday Times, of July 5th, 1885, contains a note-\nworthy exposure by a lady Spiritualist, and again in the Boston\nHerald, February, 1886, an article appeared entitled, Exposure of a\nWriting Medium. The celebrated Dr. Slade com,s to grief in Weston,\nW. Na., writes upon slates which lie upon his knees, under the tahle,\nandmoves tables and chairs with his toes. It is further recorded that\nMr. E. S. Barrett, a Weston Spiritualist, publicly denounced Slade\nbefore a concourse of people, in the Justice Hall, and in the medium's\npresence explained how his imposture had been detected.\nPassing over numerous other exposures, the Report of the Seybert\nCommission, recently published in America, devotes upwards of 20\npages to a discussion of the artifices employed by Dr. Henry Slade\nduring his seances before the Commissioners. It has been alleged that\nalthough Dr. Slade has been clearly exposed on many occasions, it is\npossible that his recent performances are perfectly genuine. It is,\nhowever, worthy of note, that there exists a complete exposure of the\nfraudulent methods used by \"~r. Wilson\" at a private seance he\nrecently held at Newcastle-on-Tyne.\nI have personally discussed this exposure with the medium. He\nexplained that the allegations of trickery on his part must be false,\nsince he suffered from paralysis on the right side. His subsequent\nbehaviour, however, betrayed the absurdity of the excuse.\nSome amount of prominence was recently given in the pages of\nLight to the report of \"Mr. Wilson's\" performance as given in the\nNewcastle Daily Chronicle, September 30th, 1887.\nAt first sight the record is \"a fair 011e to all seeming,\" but for the\nbenefit of those interested in the question, I reproduce another report\nof the same sitting from the Newcastle Daily Leade?' of September\n30th, 1887.\nFor my part, after a careful comparison of these reports, I feel that\nthe difficulty of estimating the value of human testimony under certain\npeculiar conditions, is well demonstrated by the writers. I have italicised\nsome of the points, consideration of which will, it seems to me, prove\ninstructive.\nDigitized by Go\n\fJan.,1888.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 201\nNEWCASTLE DAILY CHRONICLE, &ptember 30th, 1887.\nNo.1.\nSPIRITUALISM IN NEWCASTLE.\n[A] Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Wilaon, \"psychographic medium,\" gave a\nselect alate-writing seance at his apartments in Newcastle, to which repre-\nsentativeB of the Newcastle Preaa were invited.\n[B] Mr. WilBon states that the manifestations given by him are given\nunder the control of Dr. Davis, who was a physician at Man1tattanville, now\nNew York, above 100 years ago, and that he is also centrolled by other\nspirits. Our reporter gives the following account of what took place :-\n[C] The slates used were sent direct on Wednesday from the North of\nEngland School Furnishing Company, and the table at which the visitors and\nthe medium were seated was an ordinary deal table,.about three feet by\nthree.\n[D] The parties having joined hands, silence reigned for a few minute\u2022\u2022\nIt was broken by the medium, who stated th..ll spirits were then in the room.\nThis wa. confirmed by a Spiritualist pre.ent, who, being a clairauditor and\nclairvoyant, stated that he saw the spirit of the venerable Wesley present,\nand that he also saw a gentlemanly-looking man in a frock coat, and other-\nwise beautifully dressed, standing by the side of the medium. The latter\nremarked, \"Yes, that is Dr. Davis.\" \"Will you consent to write for us1\"\nwas the question put to the spirits, and there was an immediate knock under-\nneath the table. The next question was, \"How many are present 1\" and\nthe correct answer was rendered by a number of knocks.\n[E] The medium tken proceetUd to arrange f01' slate-writing. .A couple of\naZates, which were first of all critically e:JJamined by those present, were pl~d\ntogether, one on the top of the other, a piece of chemical pencil, about a quarter-\nof-an-inch in length, being pl~d between them. The slates were entirely new,\nqt&ite dry, and absolutely free from marks 01' writing. They were held at arm's\nlet.gth by the medium, it!. the fuZl light of day, and placed with otte end 00 the\nshoulderof a gentleman present. MeamDhile, the company had entered into a\nconversation 00 Spiritualism, in the course of which the doubts of the public,\nand even tke shams that had been p6Tpetrated in the name.of Spiritualism, were\ndisC'UBBed. .\n[F} The medium stated it~ the course ofthis debate that ke had oftetl to\ncomplain of the BUBpicions aroused in certain minds regarding ma~ifestatiooB\nIl'UCh as that ta1Wng ~ that afternoon, but ke hoped to show to those present\nthat there was flO trickery in what ke was about to do, but that it was the W01'k\nof powers beyond him.\n[G] While ke was talking, there was, to the astonishment of everyOtte present,\ntke sound of1Iig01'0'US writing betweetl tke aZates. It was impossible that the\nmedium could be writing, 8.1 both his hands were to be seen, and it was\nequally certain that the sound of the writing proceeded directlyfrom between\nthe slates. It proceeded rapidly for a time ; there was the sound of a stroke\nbeing made, and then again the writing went on as rapidly as before.\n\"There are several doing it,\" was the remark of the medium, and the finish\nof what was evidentlyanother stroke was supplemented by a knock indicating\nDigitized by Google\n\f202 Journal oj Society jor P8ychical Research. [Jan., 1888.\nthat the writing was done. The slates were removed from the shoulder of\nthe gentleman on which they had rest4id, were laid on the table, and one\nwas removed from the other. When this had been done, the under slate\nwas found to be covered with expreSilions, divided by almost straight lines.\nThe wording of these expressions was as follows:-\nUn homme sage est au-dessus de toutes les injures qu'on peut lui dire.-L. de\nMond.\nThe best answer tbat can be made to sucb outrages is moderation and patience.-\nDr. Davis.\nDavis.-8ie haben nicht unrecht.-J. S.\n[H] Quanto sinio felici di avere un tempo evoi bello la preyo de muei respetti a.\ntutta la di lei cara famiylia.-Z. E.\n[1] The writing was of a good kind, and it was clearly in different styles of\nca1igraphy. The first and second sentences had a direct bearing on the\nconversation that had previously taken place, and referred evidently to the\npart where the suspicions of the outside world had been referred to. Other\nslate manifestations followed. At times the hand of the medium shoek as if\nhe could scarcely hold the slate, so great, stated he, was the spirit influence\nupon it, and at another time it was removed from his hand under the table\nand transferred to the hand of a person sitting opposite.\n[J] A question, \"What profession are two of the inquirers present 1\"\nbrought the words on the slate, \"They are all present.\" This, however,\nwas not the right answer, and the slate, after being under the table again,\nheld nearly fast to the corner by the finger and thumb of the medium,\nreturned with the word\" Pressmen,\" which was correct.\n[K] The question tDa8 written, it sIwuld be explained, by one of the sitters,\nand was handed to the medium, with the writing down1cards, 80 that he cOllld\n\"ot possibly see it, or know 1vhat it was.\n[L] While these manifestations were going on, a heavy iron bed suddenly\nshifted its position to the extent of about three feet, a chair was thrown\nfrom a position near the w311 in the direction of the table, and raps were\nexperienced on their legs and knees by the sitters. One of the\u00b7 Spiritualists\npresent, after throwing hi!! hands up in an agitated way, suddenly had his\neyes closed, and stated that he could not, despite all his efforts, open them\nagain. He stated, however, that Wesley and other spirits were still in the\nroom, and that he was asked by one to state that these manifestations w~re\ngiven by the spirits to people on earth in order to prove that mind could\nnever die, and was eternal. He was also asked to thank the gentlemen of\nthe Press for their presence, all.d to state that the spirits had often received\ngreat favours at their hands. One of these gentlemen, he said, was both a\nhealing and a seeing medium. When this question, however, was put to the\nspirits, the answer on the slates was, \"He is not a medium,\" and with\nrespect to another gentleman present the words written were, \" He can be a\nmedium.\"\n[M] The slate was taken from the medium's hands, and transferred to a\nperson in tlte room, but the latter, it is only fair to state, exprell\/lCd the\nbelief that he could transfer the slate, if he placed it on his foot, to the\n\f.Jan., 1888.] Jowrnal of Society for Psychical Research. 203\nmedium at the opposite side of the table, and succeeded in doing 10 at the\nsecond and third attempts.\n[N] The slate had been previously transferred to persons seated in a\nposition that it seemed impossible for the medium either with his legs or his\nhands to reach. A most remarkable thing in connection with the proceedings\nwas that, when any of the sitters put their hands under the table, a strong\ncurrent of air was felt-a current that could not be perceived at any other\npart of the room. The manifestations, in short, seemed in seTeral instances\nto be beyond the power of the medium, and it is equally certain-for the\nvisitors were particular in eXfi.ID.ining everything-that Mr. Wilsen had no\nconfederates whaooTer in the room. Everything was done in open daylight,\nand the removal of the bed and the chair, together with the writing on the\ninside of a slate, covered with another, and held openly to view, COD-\ntributed considerably to baflle the thoughts of the non-Spiritualists present.\nThere was myiltery in nearly all they saw and heard, and, unless the doctrine\nof Spiritualism has more in it than the majority of people allow, they were\nunable to furm any conclusion whatever for the things they had Witneued.\nWhether the results were due to natural or supernatural means, the sitting,\nwhich lasted about an hour and a-half, was full of interest to all present. It\nis the intention of Mr. Wilbon, we believe, to remain in Newcastle for a few\n:lays longer, and any communications for him are to be addreued to Mr.\nW. H. Robinson, bookseller, The Market, Newcastle, secretary of the\nSpiritual Evidence Society.\nNEWCASTLE DAILY LEADBR, September 30th, 1887.\nNo.2.\nVISIT OJ!' A. PSYCHOGRAPHIC MEDIUM TO NEWCASTLE.-INTEREBrING\nJU.NII!'ESTA.TIONS.\nA \"Press view\" was given yesterday by the most renowned psychographic\nmedium of America, now travelling incognito, and at preaent on a allort visit\nto Newcastle. [A] The Spiritualistic power of \"Mr. Wilson\" is ill slate-\nwriting, and those who would see the manifestations must be introduced, as\nwe were introduced, through Mr. W. H. Robinsoll, the secretary of the\nSpiritual Evidence Society, at his bookstall in the Market. The latter,\nlike the worthy alderman ~presiding deity at the Art Gallery, has received\n.. the light,\" and \" sees vilioD.s\" and\" dreams dreams\" ; they know what\nthey know. If a Chippendale or a Huxley would be equally knowing, here\nis a grand opportunity, under such guides, for studying really astounding\nphenomena. There were no pretentious expectations on the part of the\nmedium. True, it came out casually that his travels had been world-wide,\nthat he had been at one time with the Czar in St. Petersburg, and at another\nwith the settlers in the backwoods of Australia, [B] always, as appeared,\naccompanied by his \"familial''' or infiuencmgpower,thespiritof a Dr. Davis,\nto which time and distance were u nothing. He had died more than 100\nyears ago in Manhattanville (now New York), and, by long practice through\nthe medium, was an expert in manifelting by writing. Mr. Wilson is an\nelderly gentleman, of English, French, and Scotch descent;; that is to say,\nDigitized by Google\n\f204 Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. [Jan., 1888.\nhis maternal grandfather was a Scotch general in France and his father an\nEnglishman. He survives all his nearest kinsfolk, as well as two wives, to\nboth of whom he was so attached that their shades are frequently with him,\nand the secretary of the Spiritual Evidence Society had scarcely sat down\nbefore he, being a \"leer,\" startled us by the visions present to him. The\nsaintly JOJlD Wealey was there an interested observer, and one he described\nand named was identified as a wife of the medium.\nThe two strangers saw nothing, although both the medium and secretary\nfelt the \"influence\" to be strong, the room being perfectly peopled by\nghostly visitors I In this pleasant condition of affairs the strangers sat down\nat one side of a square deal ttl.ble, which was enlarged by the raising of two\nwings on supportll, while the medium sat at the head and the secretary at\nthe foot.\n[0] Several new alates, freshly imported from a shop in town, were laid\ndown, with tiny fragments of slate pencil, made square, as was explained, to\nkeep the writing material from rolling off the slate.\n[D] Our quartette formed, presumably, a \"charmed circle,\" with their\nhands on the table, and immediately tappings were heard on a slate,\nrappings under the table, on the floor, and on the backs of the chairs,\nand specific knocks made by the medium, such as with the close and open\nhand, were exactly imitated. Asked as to how many spirits were prepared\nto manifest, the slate tapped out\" four.\" All this time the medium was\nrestless, and appeared to be suffering more or less from the control which,\nby-the-way, he claimed to have had all his life. Be believed the influence of\nthe spirits had been bom with him, as his parents were gifted as \"seers.\"\n[E] (}hatting toent on quite freely at the table, while the medi1Jh1l, seemed to\nbe fOTCing a slate tuitl, a bit of pencil 'Under the leaf of the table. Failing in\ndoing this at the time, another slate was placed on the top of it, frame to\nframe, with the little bit of pencil between. It was held CJ-Der the l~ft shooZdwr\n()fthewriter in his and the medwm'llright hands, the left hands remaining in\nthe circuit on the table.\n[G] Almost immediately the sound of slate pencil work was heard between\nthe slates 10 held, and whenever the medium lifted his left hand from the\ntable the influence seemed broken and the sound of writing ceased, to\nrecommence immediately on the hand being replaced. The action was like\nthe elimination of the safety fuse in an electric circuit, the psychic force, or\nmysterious power being gone. A tap on the alate informed the medium\nthat the task, or rather request, was done, and on opening the slates theside\nof one was seen to be covered with writing, as even as if it had been done on\nruled lines. According to Pope-\nHeaven first taught letters for BOme wretch's aid,\nSome banished lover, or BOme captive maid-\nbut here was a use little dreamt of in tJtat poet's philosophy. It had been\nstAted that there were four spirits prepared to manifest, and there were the\nexamples of their \"handiwork.\" The first was in French :-\nUII komme aaqe est audeum de toute.le. injuru qu'QfipM lui dire.-L. de NORd.\n[The wise man iaabove all the injurious thing8 said of him.]\n.Digitized by Google\n\fJan., 1888.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 205\nThe next paragraph was in bold English, and seemed to bear out the\naBBurance of the secretary that the viewleBB apparitions in the room were\nmuch interested in our conversation. It was :-\nThe but at'IftDef' that CIJ7I be made to 8UM outrage\u2022 ., moderation aM patience.-\nDr. Da'lJi\u2022\u2022\nAgain the cosmopolitan character of the assembly was manifested, and a\nGerman had his say, although the writing was not in the native characters :-\nDa'lJia--8ie kaben nieht1J.7If'eche.-J. S.\n[Davis-You are not wrong.]\nThe fourth was in a language we were not musician enough to understand,\nbut as Artemus Ward would say, it was \"somethin' to this effek\":-\n[H] Quanto nnw feliei di allere un tempo evoi beUo. La preyo de mici re.petn a\ntutta Zadi lei carafamigUa.-z. E.\n[L] The slate-writing feat appeared to have excited the unseen cali-\ngraphists, for on a sudden a large heavy bedstead in a comer of the room\nwas turned half-way round ; the secretary was agitated, and, saying they\nhad \"sealed his eyes,\" appeared to fall into a kind of trance; the writer\nfelt like a hand grip his right knee, and looking at his neighbour discovered\nthe lattel' turning an equivocal look at him as much as to say\" none of your\nlarks,\" yet our hands were all on the table. Then the chairs on which we\nsat got shifted a bit by no visible means, an empty chair on the opposite side\nof the table was turned round,and altogether things were,for a little,somewhat\nlively and pleasant. The medium el\"er and anon cried out suddenly, as if\nhe had received a shock from an electric battery, yet we, the strangers, felt\nin no way discomposed, and nothing happened wheu we ventured upon a\nlittle laugh-quite natural and not at all hysterical, it may be explained-c,n\n0111' own account.\n[M] The medium, in attempting to get more writing under tke table,\nthis time said he felt the power pulling the slate from him, and passing out\nof his hand it emerged at the opposite comer and was impelled with some\nforce back towards him, both his hands being above the table. The secretary\nand the other observer had it passed to them, and before receiving it, oh I\ngruesome to relate, affirmed that they each felt as if a chill breath-CO the\ncold wind rushing\" spok.en to by Mi'B. Hemans, perhaps-was being blown\nupon their hands I All.me same, one of the strangers fancied the slate\nmight be so passed on the foot and tried it, but no such movement could be\ndetected on the part of the medium. We were asked to write a question\nnnseen by tb.e medium on the slate with a view to an answer.\n[J] The question was, \"What is the profession of the inquirers at tke\ntable 1\" After some little time there was writing on the slate which read,\n\" All of you.\"\n[K] Another trial, but it iB only Jair to 8ay after the queBtion had bee?\ntold to the medium, it'1.Ca8 correctly answered. The most mysterious part of the\nsiSance, which took place, of course, in brosd daylight, was the writing\nbetween the slates. A bit of chair-turning awoke the seoretary from hjs\ntrance, and relieved his closed eyes, after which\" Good-bye\" was written\non the slate, and the extraordinary phenomena ended. We asked the\nDigitized by Google\n\f206 JO'IJI1\"M,l of Society fOT P8ychical, Research. [Jan., 1888.\nmedium why the writing could not take place above as well as below the\ntable, ad in our clear view 1 His answer was that the human eye, the reflex\nof the mind and will power, had an influence which destroyed that of the\nmanifesting spirits, and he illustrated this with the case of a bird fascinated\nby the eyes of a serpent. There was a vital power trallBU'itted that could\nnot be seen, it could only be felt! This is the latest if not last and great\nmystery, and, much puzzled, we quitted the scene.\nIn report No. 1 [0] we are told :_IC The slates used were sent direct\non Wednesday from the North of England School Furnishing Oon:pany.\"\nNo. 2 [0] says :_IC Sev~ral new slates, freshly imported from a shop in\ntown, were laid down.\" It appears probable from the above statement\nthat the slates had previously been sent direct to the medium. If we\ncompare the statements marked [E] and [Q] we find that reporter\nNo. 2 made a note of an important point not recorded by reporter\nNo. 1. We find that IC chatting went on quite freely at the table, while\nthe medium seemed to be forcing a slate with a bit of pencil under the\nleaf of the table. Failing in doing this at the time, another slate was\nplaced on the top of it, frame to frame.\" This!loes not appear such a.\nstraightforward proceeding as that described by the Newcastle Daily\nChronicle reporter. Aga.in, reporter No.1, in the passage marked [I],\nremarks that some sentences in the long message had a direct bearing\non the conversation that had recently taken place, but it is noteworthy\nthat the medium himself took a. leading part in this very conversation.\nReporter No.1 in passages [J] and [K], mentions that the medium\ncould not possibly see or know what the question was, and he alludes\nto the subsequent correct answer, and actually omits to record the\nimportant fact, mentioned by reporter No.2, that it was not until the\nquestion was told to the medium that it was correctly answered.\n[ M] It does not appear that a special experiment was devised\nto exclude the possibility of slates being moved under the table by the\nmedium's foo~, after the discovery made by one of the sitters that with\npractice he could repeat himself one of the movements. Weare simply\ntold that in previous experiments the slate bd been moved in a way\nthat seemed impossible.\nDuring a subsequent seance a.t Newca.stle-on-Tyne, IC Mr. Wilson\"\nwas detected in the act of moving a slate in the manner indicated. At\nthe time he was wearing a. sock cut down so as to admit of a free\nworking of the toes of his right foot, which, by reason of his wearing a\nlow shoe, could be easily brought into play.

J. DAVEY.\nCASE SUPPLIED TO THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nG\n-308\nt\nFrom the Rev. W. S. Grignon, of The Grove, Pluckley, Kent.\nApril 5th, 1887.\nI send you herewith some details of a first-hand record of tW()\napparitions of the same deceased person to two persons, relatives, at.\nintervals of two to four years after the death, apparently on the same spot.\nThe case came to my knowledge through the uncle of a pupil now' with me,\na retired colonel of RE., to whom the two percipients sta.nd in the relation-\nship of auntand uncle's wife respectively. Through him I sent some questiona\nto these two ladies, and with the replies received a letter from one of them,\nMrs.J., fromwhich itappeared that she was an acquaints'Uce of myown, mother\nof two boys who were under me at FeIated. I knew her la.te husband also\nvery well. She gives reasons, not flimsy and fanciful, but practically con-\nnected with the past and present ownership of the houss in question, why\ngreat trouble and annoyance might arise for herself and her lister\u00b7in-lsw if\nthe facts were to \" leak out\" in connection with the real names, and binds.\nme notto disclose them. I am compelled, therefore, to ask you w rely upon\nmy word for the following account of the parties concerned. The initials.\nwhich I have given are not the correct initiaIa of the persons described. Mr.\nJ. was a professional man of high character and good position in a country\ntown of no great size, which I call X. \"HiBS R J.\" is his sister, a lady\nnow far advanced in life. \" Mrs. J.. S. J.\" is his widow-a sensible woman\n-not, I think, likely to be fanciful and credulous in such a matter. The\nfather of my friend, Colonel B., of the R.E., married a Mias J., sister of\nMiss R :J. and Mr. J. above mentioned. Hiss F. B. is his sister (Colonel\nB.'s), now deceased. The old lady who is supposed to have appeared was\nthe mother of Miss R. J. and of Mr. J. I made such inquiries as occurred\nto me, but can send more, if there be any questions which you would car&\nto put.\nWILLUH S.

J.\nAfter two years since the death of my mother, when all sad recollections\nwere gone, I was walking one day, at 10 a.m., downstairs by myself. All of\na sudden I heard a kind of lCuttle, and turned round to see what it was, and\nthere saw distinctly my late mother coming out of her morning-room,\ndreBBed as usual, black silk dreBB, large white apron and collar, white stockings\nand black shoes. I watched for a moment or two, and BB.W her turn to go\nup a pAir of stairs to her late bedroom, when all of a sudden her head went\noff and the apparition diaa.ppeared. I related the fact at the time, and it was\nconsidered nonsense. I only BB.W it once, and hoped I should not again.\nMias R. J. has kindly replied to certain questions sent to her as follows:-\n1. \"Where is the house situated, and has it any special name 1\"\nHigh-street, X.\n2. .. Have any peculiar and unaccountable BOunds ever been heard by\nyourself or by othem 7\"\nNo.\n\" Could you sketch, however roughly, a plan of the part of the house\nwhere the apparition was seen, marking the points where it first appeared,\nand where it diaa.ppeared 7\"\nCan't dJ;8.w, and have left the house BOme time.\n4. \"Did you recognise the apparition by the face or only by the dreaa,\nor by dreBB and figure 7..\nBy the face, dress, and figure.\n5. .. Did you mention the apparition at, or abortly after, the time of ita\noccurrence to any persons who could now state their recollections of the\ncircumstance 1\"\nI mentioned the occurrence to my sister, who is dead, and another, who\nis dead also, and was not believed.\n6. \"Has this appearance ever to your knowledge been seen by any\nperson other than yQuraelf 7 If BO, when, and by whom 1\"\nI believe S8.-J.

MRs. J. S. J.\nOn leaving the nursery, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the\napparition of an old lady going slowly up a few stairs at the eDd of\npassage. There waa no light where I waa, but there waa partial light on the\nstairs from the hall gaslight. I stood still, astonished, knowing there was\nno one in the house like her. She vanished before reaching the top stair.\nSome weeks after I menb,8ned the circumstance to a young lady, F. B., who\nwaa on a visit to us, and deacribed the apparition. She said, \"That is my\ngrandmamma.\" (Died AUiUst 3rd, 1855.) I Ilever BB.W the uld lady in her\nDigitized by Google\n\fJan., 1888.] JO'IJ\/1\"'nal of Society for Psychical Research. 209\nlifetime. I did not keep a date of the occurrence, but, as far as I can\nremember, it was the winter of 1859.\nMrs. J. has also kindly replied to questions.\n1. Question as above.\nHigh St., X. No especial name in the time of the J. family.\n2. Question as above.\nHave uo idea of drawing. Passage 40 feet long. Six stairs at end of\nthis passage, leading up to bedroom. Apparition seen from other end of\npassage on second stair, moving feebly up that stair and two next-\ndisappeared.\n4. \"Did you see the face or the figure and dress only \u00a5 Could you give\nnow the description of the appearance which induced F. B. to say, 'That\nis my grandmamma ' \u00a5\"\nThe lady had her back to me, lion elderly lady, rather small, a dark dreBB,\na little shawl or something light about the shoulders, a cap.\n5. Question as above.\nI mentioned it to MiBB F. B. some weeks after the occurrence. She was\nnot in the house at the time. MiBB F. B. is now dead.\n6. Question as above.\nMiBB R. J. : I have only known this lately.\n7. Question as above.\nI have only seen the old lady in question once.\n8. Question as above.\nNo.\nI will put down on paper the length of passage, and the number of\nstairs where I saw the apparition. These few stairs led to the bedroom this\nold lady used in her lifetime. [A plan accompanied the account.]\nAs I said in my former letter, I had never seen the old lady in her\nlifetime, but from Mr. J. (my husband) I had heard a great deal of her\ngoodneBB and kindneSB, so that the sight I had-for I felt at the moment\nwho it was-gave me some astonishment but no fear. I think it right to\nadd the reason I did not communicate to others what I had seen. We were\na large family party, and some members of the same were of a highly\nnervous temperament, and I had two little children who went up and down\nthis paBB&ge daily. If what I had seen had become known, we should have\nhad endle8B trouble with the children.\nI made my communication some weeks after to Miss F. B., sister of\nColonel B. She was on a visit to me, and I made her promise not to tell\n\"the J. family.\" She died some few years ago, and it is only just lately\nthat I became aware she had mentioned the circumstance to her family.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOB. PsycmCAL RESEARCH.\nSm,-May I once more ask you to allow me space for a reply to Messrs.\nWetherby and Fry's letter 1 I am reminded of assuming too much when I\nreferred to your correspondents as being sceptics. It is evident they are so\nby their own admiBBion. For to be .. open to conviction\" llle&nB that\nDigitized by Google\n\f!10 Journal of Society for Psychical Re8earch. [Jan., 1888.\nalthough I:.ot 8011 yet convinced they might bec.me so upon certain conditions.\nJudging from the tenor of Meurs. Wetherby and Fry's laa~ letter, ihppears\nthat the conditions required for their acceptation of the truth of spiritual\nphenomena have not 8011 yet been supplied to them. Hence, I maintain that\nMeBBrB. Wetherby and Fry are still sceptics, and moat likely will remain so\nfor a loag time to come. .\nTheir memories, as regards certain statements of my own, may be\ncorroborative; but this does by no means prove that their memories are not\nat fault. I presume, in fact, I feel certain, that after their visit the subject\nW80ll further discuued and the principal subjects of our conversation\nrecapitulated. That is the very time when confusion comes in. I am\npositively certain that if the after talk had been held in my presence, many\nslight corrections as to details would have been introduced. I do not go so\nfar 8011 to pretend to recollect the whole of a conversation occupying fully\ntwo hours' time, no more than I do pretend to remember what I had for my\nlunch or dinner on that particular day. And I would not venture to again\nremind your correspondents of the fallacies of human memory were it not\nthat but for notes kept of my personal experience I should have\nforgotten many incidents and many deta.iJ.a. But 1 have a perfect\nrecollection of my personal experience as an investigator, experience\nof which I have, in almost every C8olle, kept record and to which\nI can refer; and I most emphatically deny ever having quoted as\nexamples of my own. experience CBBes which did not happen to myself. Nor\nwas I anxious, as Messrs. W(.therbyand Fry suggest, to convert others by\nexaggerating my facts; because I have invariably referred inquirers to the\nmediumB WIth whom I W80ll acquainted in order that they might judge for\nthemselves. I remember recommending MeBBrB. Wetherby and Fry to the\nseances with Husk as medium, so 8011 to afford them the opportunity of\nwitnessing the very phenomena I had described to them. Instead of\nfollowing my advice, MeBBrB. Wetherby and Fry went to a public seance\nat Williams's, where they did not meet with these phenomena. If they\nfailed to verify my statemel'ts it is certainly not my fault. I object to the\ninsinuation that I (perhaps unconsciously) (sic) exaggerated my facts in order\nto convert others, although beingl by my own admiBBion, a dupa. I was not\nthen aware that mediums cheated, and could never have admitted having\nbeen duped. Such derivations are utter nonsense. The facts are, and I am\nin a position to prove it, that from the moment I found that premeditated\nfraud on the part of mediumB was clear beyond a doubt, I withdrew from\npublic seances altogether. My letter in the June number OB professional\nmediumship was written immediately after my discovery of undoubted\ntrickery, and W80II forwarded to you lIome 18 months before its publi-\ncation. I think this letter is a sufficiently clear warning against-rat.her\nthan a recommendation in favour of-the Spiritualists' pretensions.\nAs to the pictures to which your correspondents refer, true, I only\ndescribed one because one W80ll specially mentioned. I hope Meurs. Wetherby\nand Fry are notso exactingas to expect a separate description and explanation\nof each. There were \"14\" of my pictures in thtl room I The space\nof the Joornal cannot be sacrificed to the introduction of a subject which\nDigitized by Google\n\fJan., 1888.] Journal of Society for Psychical Re8earch. 211\nscarcely interests its readers, and be filled by a catalogue of pictures which\nfew (if any) members of the Society have seen. Besides, I do not know\nwhich of the pictures were-and which were not-seen by your correspon-\ndents; there have been as many ~ 23. But since Messrs. Wetherby\nand Fry again point to a special subject, viz., the\" spirit\" with the eagle\n\",laws, I will give them the explanation they desire. At the same time, I beg\nto inform your correspondents, iIi case they are interested in the history and\n()rigin of all the drawings, that further information must be obtained, not\nthrough the pages of the JO'Umal, but upon personal application to myself.\nThe figure designated by Messrs. Wetherby and Fry as the \"spirit with\nclaws like those vf an eagle\" (an ornithologist would have said, \"nails like\na pigeon\") represented a subject exactly as it was presented to me. I do not\nnow regard that\" form\" as a visitor from the \" world unseen,\" or as a repre-\n.sentative of a distinct type of some ultra-mundane creature, but rather as the\nmedium in an abnormal condition. This may appear a startling declaration,\nperhaps not much better than an admission that it was a \"real spirit.\"\nBut, strange as this statementmay appear, I still adhere to previous assertions\nthat genuine phenomena occur at times; and that although such a\n\"presentation\" does not necessarily imply the presence of a temporarily visible\nspiritual being,my picture represented an occult manifestation. The results of\ninvestigation may demonstrate that so-called materialisations are n<>t what\nSpiritualists believe them to be, but it has not as yet been definitely sattled\nwhat these manifestations really are. And if there were not \"something\"\nextraordinary in these manifestations, Spiritualism and its phenomena could\nnot have lasted a single month..\nIt is perfectly true that I advised my visitors (Messrs. Wetherby and\nFry) not to believe in anything (Spiritualistic) until they had absolutely\nsatisfied themselves of its truth. I remember having told them that 1 could\nnot help believing in the reality of what I had witnessed over and over again.\nIs there, may I ask, anything extraordinary either in my advice or in my\nremark 1 Does not everyone believe in what he considers to be true 1 It\ndoes not follow, however, that A should necessarily be satisfied with the\nsame evidence which convinces B. If all my personal experience had been\nshared by Mesars. Wetherby and Fry they might bave arrived at tbe same-\npartlyerroneous-conclusions, or they might have by this time been converted\nto the most orthodox form of Spiritualism; or, assuming the other extreme,\nfound out all the trickery at a moment's notice. To make -use of an\nexample :-Did not the whole of thinking a.nd observing humanity up to the\ntime of Copernicus and Galileo believe that the heavens moved and tbe earth\nstood still 1 Did the ocular aemonstration that the sun rose in the east and\nset in the west satisfy Copernicus 1and did the evidence of the latter satisfy\nthe Church and priestbood of his time 1 Would Mesars. Wetherby and Fry,\nlike a modern Copernicus, prove that I am wrong and point out my fallacies,\nI would be thankful indeed.\nAs to the statement of the spirit-child, wbich your correspondent, Mr.\nFry, insists in distorting into a parody, permit me to refer him to my answer\non tbat subject in the letter addreased to yourself about a year ~o. n may\nafford Mr. Fry a certain amount of delight to turn my description of an\nDigitized by Google\n\f212 JO'Urnal of Society for P8ychical Research. [Jan., 1888.\nincident into an absurdity, but he must not expect that I sball answer it in\nthat form. Let him give my proper vemion and I will give my reply. But\nyou will notice from that letter, in which I gave you my explanation, that\nMr. Fry has mixed up the details of two distinct cases, and draws conclusions\nfrom facts belonging to the wrong case. His conjectures are, as you will see,\nbased upon false premises. I certainly do not believe in the possibility of\nany human head presenting such striking anatomical abnormalities as those\nhe suggests, whether it be the head of a daughter of a medium or of anyone\nelse. I might as well ask Mr. Fry whether he believes that, if ol1e friend of\nhis has sailed to the Antipodes and another friend had jumped a ditch, the\nformer could jump the distance between England and Australia.-I remain,\nyours truly,\nJ.

THE SOCIETY J!'OB PSYOmOAL RUEA.B.oH.\nSm,-I have read with a certain amount of interest the criticisms of Mr.\nS. J. Davey on the slate\u00b7writing performances of professional mediums,\nwhich have appeared in the Journal, of the Society.\nHe attributes them to trickery, and shows by testimony that he has com-\npletely deceived a number of persons by producing apparently identica.l\neffects through the agency of pure conjuring, adding that there are several\nways of obtaining these deceptions, but gives no clue to the modus optf\"andi\nof even one.\nNow, a large proportion of inquirers, at the very outset of their investiga-\ntions, arrive at this conclusion, though they are unable to detect the method\nadopted.\nBeyond confirming this view to BOme extent, these papers give no\ninformation from which a fresh start in the inquiry can be made.\nI therefore submit that they are unsatisfactory. What is wanted is just\nthat which is omitted, and that is how these writings can be produced by\nsleight-of-hand.\nPerhaps, however. ~{r.
