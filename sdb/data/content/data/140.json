She was educated at the George Watson\u2019s Ladies College, then at Edinburgh Medical College for Women. In 1911 she was awarded a medical degree and started working for London County Council (LCC) with responsibilities for children\u2019s health and welfare. In 1917 she was appointed Medical Officer to the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and subsequently was promoted to Inspector of Medical Services for the Royal Air Force.\n\nIn 1920 Fairfield returned to the LCC and three years later obtained a law degree, following which she took responsibility for London\u2019s Poor Law hospitals. In 1940 she re-joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and was appointed Senior Woman Medical Officer of the Armed Forces.\n\nAs one of the first qualified female doctors, Fairfield is regarded as a pioneer in medicine, and as bringing a novel focus on women\u2019s healthcare in her senior roles.&nbsp;\n\nFairfield was involved with the women\u2019s liberation campaign. She also joined the Fabian Society. In 1922 she converted to Roman Catholicism, despite disagreeing with its anti-birth control and other doctrines.  Psychical Research\n\nFairfield held a wide-ranging interest in parapsychological phenomena, joining the Society for Psychical Research in 1957 and serving on its governing council from 1958 to 1966. Her unpublished papers, now in the SPR archive in Cambridge University Library, include detailed original research into witchcraft.
