They are particularly strong in the northwestern part of North America, in Alaska and British Columbia. Reincarnation beliefs were recorded by the first settlers and missionaries to have contact with native North American peoples&nbsp;and are likely very ancient. Significantly, the beliefs are associated with the same phenomena with which reincarnation beliefs are associated elsewhere in the world, including children\u2019s memories of previous lives.

The most detailed reports come from North America.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of Amerindian reincarnation is in an account from 1612 by William Strachey, concerning the Powhatan of Virginia.2 Jesuit missionaries with the Huron and other Iroquoian groups recorded reincarnation beliefs among them beginning in the 1630s.3 For more than a century after that, there are no allusions to Amerindian reincarnation, and then only occasional mentions until the last decades of the eighteenth century, when references become more plentiful.4 Anthropologist Antonia Mills speculates that the beliefs were under-reported, partly because early settlers and missionaries did not expect to find them and so did not ask the right questions concerning the postmortem destiny of the soul. Also, Amerindian ideas of survival and reincarnation are complex and varied, making simple characterizations impossible.5\n\nAmerindian ideas differ in important respects from the Hindu and Buddhist precepts that many people associate with reincarnation. Amerindian beliefs lack the concept of karma and do not uniformly allow for humans to return as nonhuman animals or for nonhuman animals to return as humans. Several societies posit either transmigration across species lines or human-to-human reincarnation, but not both.6 Some societies credit neither cross-species transmigration nor human-to-human reincarnation. By contrast, the assumption that nonhuman animals reincarnate in their own species is common, perhaps universal. Mills found the belief that the souls of game animals returned in their own species in all ten of the Amerindian societies she surveyed.7\n\nA curious feature of Amerindian beliefs about the soul&nbsp;\u2013 shared with animistic belief systems throughout the world&nbsp;\u2013 is the idea that part of the spirit can persist in the afterlife while another part reincarnates. For some peoples, the body is associated with more than one type of soul during life and these different souls go their separate ways at death; for other peoples, a unitary soul splinters at death.8 When it comes to human-to-human rebirth, some Amerindian cultures expect it only for those who die young or those who die violently. Generally, reincarnation is thought to occur within the society. In groups with unilineal social organizations&nbsp;\u2013 where kinship is reckoned&nbsp;through either the mother or the father but not both together&nbsp;\u2013 reincarnation follows a similar pattern. In some groups, it is thought possible to decide on one\u2019s next parents before one dies. A few cultures&nbsp;\u2013 mostly in the Arctic and the Pacific Northwest&nbsp;\u2013 say that more than one soul may possess a single body at the same time or one spirit may divide or replicate postmortem, then reincarnate in multiple bodies simultaneously.9\n\nReincarnation is not embraced with the same intensity throughout the North American continent. In some societies, the belief is left to the individual, whereas in others, it is an element of the common culture. Interestingly, however, wherever they are found, human-to-human reincarnation beliefs are linked to the same set of signs that appear in conjunction with reincarnation beliefs throughout the world. These signs include dreams and apparitions announcing rebirth;10&nbsp;birthmarks and other congenital physical traits;11&nbsp;behavioural traits; and past-life memories. There may also be memories of the intermission period between lives.12 Sometimes shamans or similar practitioners may tell who a baby was before, but often announcing dreams, birthmarks&nbsp;and telltale behaviors are employed to identify a newborn so that he or she may be given the same name as before and stand to inherit property, prerogatives&nbsp;and status enjoyed in the previous life.13\n\nThe following is a list of North American native children with past-life memories. These cases were studied and reported by Mills and other anthropologists and by Ian Stevenson.  North American Native Children with Past-Life Memories  Alan Gamble (Tsimshian)\n\nShortly before Alan Gamble\u2019s birth, his father dreamed that his deceased brother would be returning as his child. His brother said in the dream that he would have to go to hospital once more after birth before he was well. This was a reference to the circumstances of his death. Alan\u2019s uncle had accidently shot himself through the hand with a shotgun for which he was reaching. He had been in a boat at the time and it took ten hours to get him to the nearest hospital. Meanwhile, a tourniquet was applied to his arm, but because it was not loosened to allow blood to flow into the lower arm, by the time he reached the hospital, gangrene had set in, and he was unconscious. His lower arm was amputated but the stump became infected. He died in&nbsp;hospital some days later without having regained awareness.\n\nAlan was born with two birthmarks, one on the palm of his hand, the other on the back of his wrist. These birthmarks corresponded to places the shell had entered and exited his uncle\u2019s hand, as confirmed by a death registry Stevenson inspected. Alan\u2019s arm began to swell below the elbow and spread down to his hand. He was carried to&nbsp;hospital, where he spent a few weeks, then recovered. As a toddler, he recalled the accident and took responsibility for it, which came as a relief to his former brother-in-law and boating partner, who had had to endure years of uncertainty over his role in the accident. By the time Stevenson investigated the case, however, Alan had forgotten his memories.14   Amy (Beaver)\n\nAmy was noticed to have a red mark on her left breast at birth, but her parents did not connect this with anyone they knew. She did not speak of past-life memories until age four, when, while riding on a bus, she suddenly said to her mother, \u2018I sure hate Frank Alta. I never want to see his face again.\u2019&nbsp;Amy had never met this man, who had moved to a different reserve before her birth. On another occasion she told her mother, \u2018I\u2019d sure like some fish from Fish Lake. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had any.\u2019&nbsp;Amy had never eaten fish from Fish Lake in her lifetime. These two statements made her parents think she was the reincarnation of Marie Alta, Frank\u2019s late wife. The Altas had often fished at Fish Lake, where they had dried fish. A Beaver \u2018prophet\u2019 (shaman) confirmed that this was so. Marie had died under suspicious circumstances in a house that had caught fire and burned to the ground. Her parents had suspected Frank\u2019s involvement, but because they had no proof, had not contacted the authorities about it.15  Charles Porter (Tlingit)\n\nAs a child, Charles Porter would talk about having been killed by a spear in a clan fight some decades prior. In so saying, he pointed to his right side, where he had a diamond-shaped birthmark. The birthmark was not visible to him and the first time he did this, he was not aware of it. He also named his killer, who at that time was an elderly man.16  Corliss Chotkin&nbsp;Jr (Tlingit)\n\nThe case of Corliss Chotkin&nbsp;Jr&nbsp;is one of the most developed Native American reincarnation cases yet recorded. Corliss was recognized as the reincarnation of his mother\u2019s uncle, Victor Vincent. Victor had liked Corliss\u2019s mother and before his death had told her that he intended to be reborn to her, adding that she would know it was him by birthmarks commemorating his two surgical scars. One of these was at the right side of the base of his nose, the other on his back. Shortly before Corliss\u2019s birth, an aunt dreamed that Vincent told her that he would be going to the Chotkins. At birth, Corliss was found to have two prominent birthmarks, matching Victor\u2019s surgical scars. The one on his back was especially striking. It consisted of a rectangular patch surrounded by small round points, suggesting stitches. Corliss was aggravated by this birthmark, or the scar it represented. He complained that it itched and continually scratched at it, resulting in its becoming reddened over time.\n\nWhen he was thirteen months old, and his mother was trying to teach him to say his name, Corliss told her that it was not Corliss, but Kahkody, Victor Vincent\u2019s tribal name. When he was two years old, he recognized several people Victor had known when he encountered them on the street. He recalled that once when Victor\u2019s boat motor had given out, he changed into his Salvation Army uniform to attract the attention of a passing ship. On another occasion he identified a room in which Victor used to sleep, although the building had been repurposed and no longer had recognizable bedrooms. Corliss\u2019s mother also noted several habits that reminded her of Victor, such as the way he combed his hair. When young, he demonstrated a facility with boat engines, a skill that Victor had developed. Corliss also suffered from a severe stutter, as Victor had, and he was left-handed, like Victor.17   Jeffery (Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en)\n\nThere were no announcing dreams preceding Jeffery\u2019s birth, nor were there birthmarks or other signs indicating who he had been in his previous life. An \u2018Indian doctor\u2019 held the infant in his arms and identified him as the reincarnation of Jeffery\u2019s mother\u2019s brother Will, who had died six years earlier after being kicked in the stomach and head by a horse he was harnessing. An aunt caring for Jeffery awoke one night to see the apparition of Will (her brother) sitting on the bed next to her, from which she realized that Will had returned as Jeffery.\n\nJeffery gave no sign of remembering Will\u2019s life until he was five years old and was taken by his grandparents to the camp where Will had died. He recognized the camp&nbsp;\u2013 a logging camp at which trees were felled and prepped to be used as railway ties&nbsp;\u2013 and described how they had skidded poles out of the bush. He also identified the area where he and some friends had shot a moose. Jeffery told his grandmother, \u2018I am not your grandson. I am your son come back to you\u2019 and thenceforth went to live with his grandparents, whom he called his parents. He began to dream about Will and continued dreaming about him into adulthood.18  Jimmy Svenson (Tlingit)\n\nWhen Jimmy Svenson was about two years old, he began recalling the life of his mother\u2019s brother, John Cisco, who had lived in Klukwan, a village one hundred miles away from his own village. John had disappeared from a boating excursion with two women when he was 25. The bodies of the women were found drowned, but John\u2019s body was never recovered, perhaps having washed out to sea. Foul play was suspected but could not be proven. Jimmy was born a little more than two years later with four small round birthmarks on his abdomen. These birthmarks had the appearance of entry wounds from gunshots. Jimmy would point to them, saying they were where he had been shot to death, but because John\u2019s body had not been recovered, this could not be confirmed. Jimmy said he used to drink wine, which was true of John Cisco, and he spoke frequently and in detail about Klukwan, to which he had never been in his present life.19  Nathan (Gitxsan)\n\nNathan recalled having been his great-grandfather, Mark Peters Sr. This man had suffered a serious accident at a logging site, when logs that he was loading on a railway car slipped and he fell, causing a puncture wound to his chest. He was taken to hospital where he recovered, but thereafter had a permanent scar on his chest, where he had been hurt. Mark Peters Sr lived for many more years, eventually dying in his eighties. Sometime later, his son, Mark Peters Jr, dreamed that his father came to him to say that he would be returning to the family as the child of Mark Jr\u2019s daughter, Karen. When Karen gave birth to a boy, whom she named Nathan, it was noticed that he had a birthmark on his chest in the place that Mark Sr had had the scar from the logging accident.\n\nNathan would point to this birthmark even before he could crawl, much less speak. He pulled up his shirt to display it to Mills when she met him in 2004, when he was four years old. Nathan apparently never spoke about the accident, but he did talk about other memories of Mark Sr\u2019s life. He recognized Mark Sr\u2019s old fishing boots and when he first saw a helicopter flying overhead, said he had ridden in one, which was correct for Mark Sr. Nathan also revealed his identification with Mark Sr behaviourally. He would point out the best fishing sites on rivers, he knew how to hang fish correctly in the smokehouse&nbsp;and he made sure that his grandmother properly salted the fish they caught. Once after his grandfather\u2019s car got a flat tyre he had to change by the side of the road, Nathan made sure he understood what he should do in the event of a bear attack. He was not to run away, but to stand his ground, make his eyes big&nbsp;and jump round like a monkey. If he fell, he was to place his pack behind his head, so the bear would eat the pack rather than his neck.20   Norman Despers (Tlingit)\n\nNorman Despers said only two things about a previous life, but both&nbsp;matched his grandfather, of whom he was thus assumed to be the reincarnation. When taken to a location on a cove at age three or four, he suddenly proclaimed excitedly, \u2018I used to have a smokehouse on the straight here and later I was blind'.&nbsp;Norman\u2019s grandfather indeed had had a smokehouse there and had been blind for the last four years of his life. Norman himself had poor eyesight and began to wear glasses regularly when he was fourteen.21   Paul (Dene Tha)\n\nA Dene Tha boy named Paul recalled having been a girl named Denise. Denise fell ill and was taken to hospital, where she died. A year later, the spirit of Paul's mother\u2019s deceased sister Rose helped to guide her to Paul's mother, then in labour in the same hospital. Paul's mother saw Rose\u2019s and Denise\u2019s apparitions enter her hospital room. Denise grabbed Rose from behind and Paul's mother fell unconscious.\n\nPaul\u2019s identification with Denise was confirmed by a birthmark on his abdomen, matching one Denise had had in the same place. As he grew up, Paul experienced strong gender identity conflicts. He enjoyed dressing and styling his hair as a girl and using make-up. In Dene Tha culture, those born in bodies of the opposite sex are expected to mature into their biological sex, and although this was delayed in Paul\u2019s case, eventually his peers succeeded in giving him a heterosexual initiation and beginning his socialization as a male.22   Rhonda Mead (Gitksan)\n\nOn the eve of Rhonda Mead\u2019s birth, her grandmother Margaret flew to Vancouver to be present for it. That night, she had a vivid dream of her mother, Susan Albert. Margaret was surprised to see her and asked her why she was in Vancouver. Susan explained that she wanted to be reborn to Margaret\u2019s daughter Cynthia. She told Margaret that she would have blonde hair. Indeed, Rhonda, when born, had blonde hair. On her wrist, she had a birthmark in the shape of an S, Susan\u2019s initial, which Susan had had tattooed at the same spot on her wrist. Rhonda never spoke about Susan, although she recognized some of her property, which she claimed as her own. Rhonda was particularly possessive about an easy chair, which she would not allow anyone else to use. She insisted on sitting in it herself, although it was much too large for her. One day, she observed her mother looking through some jewellery and picked out one of Susan\u2019s bracelets, which she insisted was hers. Once when someone mentioned the amount \u2018seven dollars\u2019&nbsp;Rhonda said, \u2018That\u2019s my dog.\u2019&nbsp;Susan had owned a dog, for which she had paid seven dollars, named Seven Dollars.23  Wilfred Meares (Haida)\n\nWilfred Meares was identified as the return of his mother\u2019s uncle, Victor Smart. Victor was killed in a car crash, thrown from the vehicle at the moment of impact. The back of his head struck the pavement, breaking his neck. He was not driving the car and was not drunk at the time of the accident, although he had been fond of alcohol. During the frequent occasions he and his wife were on a binge, they had his niece, Ruby, take care of their children. This endeared Ruby to Victor and he sometimes told her that he would come back as her child. During her pregnancy, Ruby twice dreamed of Victor. In these dreams, he appeared before her standing and smiling for a moment, then walked away.\n\nWilfred was born with an open patch on the back of his head. When Ruby first saw him, a green pus oozed from this patch, but it soon healed. As Wilfred grew older, he showed a fondness for alcohol. Even as a toddler, he would stand near people who were drinking until he was given a sip. He did not say much about Victor\u2019s life, but on one occasion, when he heard a cousin express her wish to die young like her father, he said, \u2018Don\u2019t say that. I died young too.\u2019&nbsp;Asked how he had died, he said: \u2018I got killed in a car, but I came back.\u2019&nbsp;24  William George&nbsp;Jr (Tlingit)\n\nWilliam George Jr was taken to be the reincarnation of a man named William George. Toward the end of his life, William George Sr told his favourite son and daughter-in-law that \u2018if there is anything to this rebirth business\u2019, he would return as their child. He asserted further that they would know him by birthmarks like ones he then bore. These were two prominent moles, each about half an inch in diameter. One was on the top of his left shoulder, the other on the volar surface of his left forearm. Additionally, he gave his son a gold watch he had received from his mother and asked that it be kept for him. \u2018I\u2019ll come back,\u2019&nbsp;he said. \u2018Keep this watch for me. I am going to be your son. If there is anything like&nbsp;[reincarnation], I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\n\nA few weeks after saying this, William George disappeared from his seine fishing boat. Very soon thereafter, his daughter-in-law became pregnant. During her labour, under an anesthetic, she dreamed of William George, and regained awareness to find she had given birth to a baby boy. The baby had moles on the upper surface of his left shoulder and on the volar surface of his left forearm, exactly where William George&nbsp;Sr&nbsp;had had the moles he had said he would reproduce on his new body, and was named William George&nbsp;Jr. As he matured, his parents observed in him many traits that confirmed this identification. He had many of the same likes and dislikes as his namesake. William George Sr had walked with a limp due to an injury on a basketball court, and Willian George Jr had a similar gait. He demonstrated a precocious knowledge of boating and seemed to understand how to work seine nets, although he was somewhat fearful of water, more so than other boys his age.\n\nWilliam George Jr expressed his identification with his grandfather in the way he addressed people, using kin terms appropriate to William George Sr. He referred to his great-aunt as \u2018sister\u2019 and his aunts and uncles as his sons and daughters. He demonstrated parental concern with their behaviour. He also showed an uncanny familiarity with places known to William George Sr. William George Jr was four or five when he made one of his most remarkable recognitions. His mother one day decided to go through the items in her jewellery box and laid these out in her bedroom. Wandering into the room while she was doing this, he spotted his grandfather\u2019s gold watch. \u2018That\u2019s my watch,\u2019&nbsp;he said. He picked it up, held it tenaciously for a while, and only reluctantly allowed his mother to return it to the jewellery box. Several times thereafter, he asked to see \u2018his watch\u2019, and as he grew older, insisted that it be given to him, although it never was.25\n\nJames G Matlock  Literature\n\nGoulet, J-G.A.
