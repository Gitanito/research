As I was walking one morning, lail\nfummer, along Whitechapel, I was ob\u00ad\nliged to take fljelter from a ihower of\nrain in a cottage near the turnpike. The\nfamily were at breakfaft, at their tea,\nand, as the rain continued, I had lei-\nfure to reflect on the advantages of com\u00ad\nmerce, which thus, in a manner, joins\nthe oppofite extremities of the earth, by\nbringing their products together; at the\nfame time, that the variety in the equi\u00ad\npage of the tea-table, or indeed, ftoof,\non which \u2018 there was nothing of a piece\/\nA 5 fug-\nDigitized by C j O O g l e\n\fx P r e f a c e .\nfuggefted a juft ridicule on the vanity of\nluxury.\nThis Iaft reflection was extended to all\nthe purfuits of man, on the fight of a piece\nof written paper, that ferved inftead of a\nplate to hold their butter,\u2014 \u2018 Who knows\n* (thought I) but the writer of this be\u00ad\n* (lowed time and care upon it, and pro\u00ad\n* mifed himfelf both profit and fame, in\n\u2018 reward of his labour ?\u2019\nThis thought raifed a curiofity to look\nat the paper, which; by this time, was\nfcraped quite clean. 1 therefore, after a\nfew words of converfation, to introduce my\nrequeft, defired leave to lee it, which was\nreadily granted; when I was furprized to\nfind my conjecture, as I imagined, confirm\u00ad\ned, by its appearing to be part of fome re\u00ad\ngular work.\n\\\nCuriofity had now a ftronger m otive;.\nthan idle gratification! I aiked where they\nhad got that paper and on their telling\nme, at the chandler\u2019s (hop next door,\nthough this difcouraged me a good deal, I\nrefolved to purfue my enquiry, and went to\nthe (hop, as if for fome fnuff, which as I\nexpefted,\nyGoogle\n\fXI\nexpelled, was given me on a piece of the\nfame paper.\nThe rain ltill giving me a pretence for\ndelaying there, I entered into difcourfe\nwith the woman, and among other idle\nqueftions, afked her where lhe ufually got\npaper to wrap her wares in, to which lhe an\u00ad\nswered, * Sometimes from the public of\u00ad\n* fices, and fometimes from the bookfellers\n* and printers ? and, when lhe was difap-\n* pointed at thofe places, lhe was forced to\n* buy brown paper, which was much dear\u00ad\n* er; though, at prefent, lhe made ufe o f\n* fome old fluff that had lain a great while\n< lumbering her garret, having belonged\n* to a lodger of her mother\u2019s, who died\n* many years ago.\u2019\nI then changed the difcourfe, for fear lhe\nIhould perceive my defign j but prefently\nfeeing her going to tear more, for fomebo-\ndy elfe that came in, I could not forbear\nany longer, but offered her brown paper\nfor all the written paper lhe had, as that\nwas moft proper for fome work I defigned,\nwhich lhe readily agreed to, and fold me\nher whole ftock for eighteen-pence.\nP R E F A C E.\nThis\nyGoogle\n\fThis adventure put an end to my walk,\nfo I took the firft coach that went by, and\nhurried home to examine my purchafe,\n\u25a0 which I found to confift of a number of\nfragments, upon various fubje&s, whether\noriginally left unfinilhed, or torn thus in\nthe chandler\u2019s ihop, it was impoflible to\nfay : and, among the reft, the following\nwork, which feemed to have undergone a\ndifferent, though not much better fate,\nbeing blotted in many places, often para\u00ad\ngraphs, and fometimes whole pages being\nerafed j and, what was worft, this havoc\nwas made in the moft curious and enter\u00ad\ntaining part of the whole, the\nthe nature and agency offpirits.\nThe oddity of this colledtion, made me\nrefolve to try. if I could learn any thing of\nthe author, from the woman of the ihop,\nwhere I had made my purchafe j accord\u00ad\ningly, 1 called upon her one evening, as\nif merely accident, and fending for a\npint of wine, to fet her tongue a going, I\nno fooner hinted my defire, than ihe di-\nre\u00a3Uy gave me the following account,\nwhich 1 ihall repeat as nearly as pofiible, in\nher own words, ihortening it only of exple\u00ad\ntive exclamations and repetitions.\nXii P R E F A C E .\n* M y\nyGoogle\n\f\u00ab My father (faid Ihe) dying young, and\n* leaving his family but poorly, my mo*\n\u2018 ther took this Ihop to help her to bring\n* up three children, of whom I, the eldeft,\n* was but five years old.

He was\nthe fon of an officer of diftinguilhed merit, the\nfervices of whofe life had, in the 80th year of\nIt, been rewarded with the command of a regi\u00ad\nment, and the hopes of his fon crowned with a\npair of colours ; which, on the death of his fa\u00ad\nther, in fix mouths after his elevation, he found\nto be his whole inheritance; the fees of office,\nand the equipage for his new rank*, having ex-\nG 2 haufted\nyGoogle\n\fhaufted all the favings of the old man\u2019s fubalterr*\nfrugality.\u2014 The moil exemplary duty, in five\nwarm campaigns, had advanced the fon to the\nrank of a lieutenant, when the exaltation of the\nperfon towhom he now applied, raifed his hopes\nto a company, which was vacant in the regi\u00ad\nment, and his right by feniority; for fuch was\nhis ignorance of mankind, that he built fanguine\nexpectations on the very rcafons thatihould have\ndeprived him of any, the obligations o f the perfon\nto whom he applied, to his fa th er, who had taken\nhim up, the poor friendlefs orphan of an enfign,\neducated him at his own expence, procured him\nhis fir\u00edt commiilion, and afterwards lent him the\nmoney with which he had purchafed his compa\u00ad\nny : a debt which the fon was weak enough to\nexpe& a friendibip from, though it, and much\nmore, had long fince been cleared at play.\nBut, though the character of the fon, and the\ngeneral\u2019s known intimacy with the father, in a\nmanner obliged him to promife him his friend-\nihip, yet nothing was farther from his thoughts\nthan ever to do him any real fervice; as he ima\u00ad\ngined that would be acknowledging the obliga\u00ad\ntions which his very attendance feemed to up\u00ad\nbraid him with : a dinner now and then being\nthe only favour he ever had, or ever meant to\ngive him.

As my fuccefs made thefe funis very\n4 confiderable at firft, he conceived an opinion of\n4 my being a perfon of confequence and fortune\n4 above my appearance. This infpired him with\n4 fuch refpedt for me, that if at any time I even\n4 hinted an occafion for more than I had in his\n4 hands, he not only offered to fupply me, but\n4 even looked upon my acceptance as an honour.\n4 T o confirm him in this way of thinking, I fre-\n4 quently accepted of his offers when l had no\n4 occafion, only that the pun&uality of my pay-\n4 ment might make him ftill the readier whenever\n4 I ihould.\n4 Nor was it long before I was obliged ter avail\n4 myfelf of this fcheme. A bad run at play ftrip-\n4 ped me of all my money, and my tradefmen\n4 brought in their bills, fo that my former re-\n4 fources were at an end. In this difficulty I ap-\n4 plied to my landlord, who readily fupplied me\n4 with all the money in his poffeffion ; and, that\n4 not being fufficient, borrowed as much more as\n4 he could, till my remittances ihould arrive from\n4 my eftate.\n4 This fupply might have extricated me from\n4 the difficulties of the prefent moment. But I\n4 was awoke from my golden dreams, and faw\n4 that this was the laft money I could any ways\n4 expefi: to raife, as my practices began to be\n4 fufpe&ed, and every body had taken the alarm\n4 againil me ; fo that, if I parted with it, I\n4 ihould only gain a momentary relief, as my\n4 landlord would foon expedl to be paid alfo.

In this di-\n4 lemma my ready genius prompted a fcheme that\n* would not only fecure me from him^but alfo give\n* me time to prepare for my decampment with\n* more convenience. Upon my firft coming to\n4 his houfe, I had contrived, by taking the im-\n4 preffions inwax, to get falfekeys to all his locks.\n4 This is a piece of precaution, which no man of\n4 prudence will ever negleft. In purfuance of my\n4 fcheme, the morning after I received the money\n4 from him, and before I was to pay it away by\n4 appointment, I took the opportunity, while he\n4 was at church, to convey into his clofet feveral\n4 things of value, my property in which I could\n4 clearly prove, taking away, at the fame time,\n4 the obligations which I had given him for the\n4 money he had lent me, which his confidence in\n4 my honour had prevented his taking the precau-\n4 tion of having witneffes to.\n4 As foon as I had done this, I went direflly\n4 to a magiftrate, before whom I made oath of my1\n4 being robbed of a large fum of money and many\n4 of my moft valuable effects, among which I\n4 particularly named the things I had left in his\n4 clofet, and required an authority to apprehend\n4 my landlord, and fearch his houfe, as I had rca-\n4 fon to fufpe& that he had ftolen them, having\n4 caught him often coming out of my apartments\n4 in\n*S6 C H R Y S A L j OR, TH E\n,\nyGoogle\n\fin evident confufion, and at times when my\nbeing abfent deprived him of every honeft reafon\nof going into them; and this charge I had con\u00ad\nfirmed by the teftimony of my valet de chambre9\nand another perfon, whom I had prepared pro\u00ad\nperly. '\n4 Though the execution of fentence is not\nquite fo fudden in England as in Turkey, an ac-\ncufation of this kind, however groundlefs, is,\nin many refpe&s, not much lefs dreadful; the\nharpies of the law never lofing their hold of the\naccufed, till they have devoured every thing in\nhis poffeffion. The warrant I demanded was\nreadily granted for this reafon ; and away I\nrefolutely went, in company with the officers,\nto execute it. We found my landlord, in the\nfecurity of innocence, in his parlour, waiting\nfor my coming in to dinner. It is impoffible\nto exprefs his aftoniihment, when they laid\nhold of him like a thief, and told him it was\non my accufation. All the refolution and pre\u00ad\nfence of mind I was matter of were requifite\nto bear me through the feene! At firft he was\nunable to fpeak a word, which the candour of\nhis accufers did not fail to conftrue into a filent\nacknowledgement of his guilt; but, recovering\nhimfelf in a few moments, he firft raifed his\neyes to heaven, and then turning them upon\nme, gave me a look that almoft froze the blood\nin my veins ^but never deigned to fpeak a word\nto me.\n4 He then addreffed himfelf to the officers, and\nmildly defired that they would execute their duty\nwith lenity, nor offer any indignity to the fa-\ncred chara&er he bore, till a proof of his guilt\n4 Ihould\nADVENTURES OF A GUINEA. * * 7\n,\nyGoogle\n\fc Ihould make him appear unworthy of the fane-*\n4 tion of it,\n* Such behaviour had an effe\u00a3l not to be deferi-\n4 bed upon all that wereprefent.

Accord-\n4 ingly, I raifed my voice, and, with a ftern ac-\n4 cent, commanded the officers to do their duty,\n4 and fearch the houfe, before his accomplices\n4 ihould have time to.convey away the things we\n4 came in quell of. This word put an end to a\n4 compaifion that was contrary to their nature,\n4 and they proceeded to their bufinefs with their\n4 ufual keennefs j though ftill with refpedl, till\n4 they came to fearch his clofet, where the fight\n4 of things, which I had fworn to have been flolen-\n4 from me, appeared fo plain a proof of his guilt,\n4 that they treated him with all the indignity of\n4 the vfleft malefa&or.\n4 Secure in his innocence, he had hitherto pre-\n4 ferved a fteadinefs of temper that feemed fupe-\nc riour to the power of fortune; but at this fight\n4 his refolution failed him.

But this was not neceffary ;\nthey ranfacked every place, and toffed about\nevery thing that was too large for them to con\u00ad\nvey away, till they made his whole houfe one\nfcene of defolation.

The plan laid down by the\nGeneral was, that an officer, with a party of\nmen, ihould go from another poll, juft before\nthe dawn, to reconnoitre the redoubt, and, if he\nfound that the fire of the night had made the\nimpreffion expeSed, a fignal was to be given for\nthis Officer to advance and make the attack.\nThe other accordingly marched, but miffed his\nway, and falling in with a leffer redoubt, mif-\ntook it for the objeift of his defignation, and in-\nconfideiately attacked it, upon which the fignal\nwas given for this Officer to proceed.

He, therefore,\ncontinued his march ilowly, till they had got\nbeyond him; and then facing fuddenly about,\npufhed with all fpeed for the redoubt they had\nthus abandoned.

No\u00ad\nthing elfe was talked of in the army, where the\nfortune\n*8 CHRYSAL: OR, THE\nyGoogle\n\ffortune of this Officer was looked upon to be\nmade. But no opportunity offered for promot\u00ad\ning him during the remainder of the expedition,\nfo that the only reward in the General\u2019s power\nto give him, was thanking him pubfickly at the\nhead of the army, which he did in the ftrongeft\nterms. Refolved, however, to be the inftrument\nof his promotion, though he could not promote\nhim himfelf, he reprefented him, on his return,\nin fo advantageous a light to one, whofe inclina\u00ad\ntion it was known to be, and who from bis office\nJhould have had it in his power to reward merits that\nhe promifed to do him juftice.\nBut the delicacy of this Officer\u2019s fenfe of ho\u00ad\nnour defeated thefe generous intentions.

M anagers and\nPoets equally in faulty in their dealings w ith each\nether. \u2022\nH E day after this great affair was thus\nequitably fettled, on the treafurers making\nup his week\u2019s account, I came into the poffeffion\nof the manager, who having fome occafion for\nmoney put me into his pocket.\nThe meafures of my new mailer\u2019s government\nin his little empire were the ilrongeit burlefque\non the policy of the world, the greateft fove-\nreign in which had not more intrigues offa te to\nmanage, than were continually carrying on\nabout him, from the ambition, envy, and\njealoufy of the feveral candidates for his royal\nfavour.\nBut all this buftle did not embarrafs him in\nthe lead. He had the addrefs to play off one\nparty againft another; and by never engaging\nhim felfparticularly to any, was able to manage alU\nA method, by the by, that might fuggeft an\nhint\nX\nDigitized by Google\n\fhint not unufcful to politicians in an higher\nfphere. ,\nBut the part of his conduct that was moft\ncurious, and gave me the greateft pleafure, was\nhis manner of parrying the attacks of the authors\nwho were continually bringing him their works\nfor reprefentation on the ftage, of which I had\nan opportunity of feeing many ftriking inftances.\nAs it is evidently the intereil of the manager of\na theatre, to exhibit thofe performances, whofe\nmerit is moft likely to gain the approbation of.\nthe publick; and as no man who is capable of\nwriting a piece proper for exhibition can be\nfuppofed to want judgement to know whether\nit has that merit, you may naturally think that\nthere could not be much-difficulty in the inter-\nN:ourfe between them ; but human a&ions are\nnot always to be judged of from the ftrongeft\nappearances of reafon.\nThe reprefentation of a new piece necefTarily\nputs the manager to fome expenfe and much,\ntrouble. If you add to this, the natural anxiety\nabout fuccefs, fo r merit is often rejetted by caprice,\nor perfonal prejudice, you will not wonder that\nhe ihould be cautious what he brings upon the\nftage; and prefer ailing old ones, unattended\nwith thefe inconveniencies, while the publick\nwill bear the repetition, and does not peremp\u00ad\ntorily demand new.\nThis is the real reafon, why fo few new\npieces are performed; and not any decline of\nK 6 poetical\nADVENTURES OF A GUINEA. *03\nyGoogle\n\f204 CHRYSAL: OR, THE\npoetical genius to produce them; it being cer\u00ad\ntain that there are as many good plays written\nnow, as at any former point of time. But the\nmatter is this. All the good ones of thofe times\nlie together before you, and raife your opinion to\nthe happy days which produced them : But if\nyou confider the long intervals between, and the\ninnumerable bad ones which appeared along with\nthem, but are now loft in the wreck of time,\nyou will find that you have not fo great reafon to\ncomplain of the prefent decline of genius, as\nyou may have imagined.\nI do not by this mean, that every one who\npretends to write is poffeffed of that genius; or\nthat all the pieces offered to the ftage are proper\nfor representation. On the contrary, many who\nwant every qualification indifpenfible to fuccefs\nin fuch attempts, make them every day in defi\u00ad\nance of reafon; and ftrive to obtrude upon the\npublick works which are a reproach to common\nfenfe.\nThe motives of this are obvious. Whenever\na man is at a lofs how to fpend his time, or wants\nto raife a little money, down he fits without\nmore ado, and writes a play. The confequence\nof this is, that the very reafons which made him\nturn poet neceffarily preclude him from fuccefs*\nJdlenefs prevents that care, that lim a labor,\nwhich alone can make a performance proper\nfor publick representation; and dijirefs depreffes\nthe\nj by Google\n\fthe imagination ; and hinders its rifing to that\nhappy boldnefs, which is the eflence of poetry. *\nIt appears from hence, that if the managers\nof theatres from interefted motives are often to\nblame for receding good pieces ; poets (or thofe\nwho would be thought fuch) are much oftener\nculpable for. offering them bad ones* The\ndifference of opinion unavoidable on this\naccount occaiions the difficulty in their in-\ntercourfe. But in this the conteft is not\nequal. The word of the manager is decifive ;\nwhile the poet has nothing left, but to vent-\nhis refentment in unavailing (and often unjuft)\ncomplaints, and abufe, in which thofe who\nhave leaft right are always loudeft; for en\u00ad\namoured with the beauty of their own offspring,,\nlike the ape in the fable, they throw dirt at all\nwho prefume to find fault with it.\nBut fevere as it muft be to fuffer this, it\nis not the greateft difficulty the manager has\nto encounter with them. Not fatisfied with\nthe civil refufal of affe&ed delays and ex-*\ncufes, they muft have a direct anfwer, which,\nthey controvert with all their power,, and ob\u00ad\nlige him to fupport by fuch arguments as\nmuft give him pain, if he has either politenefs\nor good-nature; though, after all, inftead of\nconvincing them, he only gets their\u2019s and\ntheir friends ill-will> and arms all their tongues\nagainft him.\nADVENTURES OF A GUINEA. \u00b1oS\nIt\nyGoogle\n\fC H R Y S A L : O R , T H E\nso6\nIt is not to be doubted but the evafons which\nmanagers ufe to Jhift o ff good pieces are as\ngrofsly offcnfive to moral propriety, truth, and\ncandour, as the arguments of authors in defenfe\nofbad ones can poffibly be to reafon; but as I\ndid not happen to be witnefs to anyinftances of\nthem, 1ihall confine my account to the latter.\nC H A P .\niyGoo le\n\fADVENTURES OF A GUINEA, \u00ab\n\u00ab\n?\nC H A P .

But in the evening of his\ndays, when all that heat and hurry gave place to\ncool reflexion, and the ferenity of the profpeit\nmore than compenfates for its approaching clofe,\nthe whole feene was wretchedly reverfed, and his\nfetting fun over-caft with a cloud of vices\nmoil\nyGoogle\n\fmoft blameable in any ftage of life, but aggra\u00ad\nvated ten thoufand-fold in his, to which they\nwere unnatural.\nI have told you before, that vanity was the\ncaufe of a fall, fo reproachful to humanity:\nThe manner, though, of its operating upon one\nwho feemed to be removed fo far beyond its reach\nis worthy of attention. -\nIn no infiance is the power of vanity fo tyran\u00ad\nnically exerted over the human heart, as when it\narifes from an opinion of literary merit. The\nreafon is obvious. Real learning, is the moft\neffeftual check to vanity, as it (hows the infta-\nbility of its foundation. When, therefore, any\nthing that makes pretence, however falfely, to\nthat name, feems to adminifter to its fupport, it\ninfiantly looks upon itfelf a3 above controul.\nThough early engagement in the a&ive fcenes\nof his country\u2019s fervice had prevented his making\nany great proficiency in the more abftrufe purfuits\nof fpecul ation, his natural inclination to them,\ndire&ed by a tafte formed by the beft education,\nmade him embrace all opportunities of patroniz\u00ad\ning every advance in fcience, and improvement\nin the finer arts.\nThe liberality with which he indulged this\ninclination foon marked him out to the attacks\nof every needy adventurer in the trade of letters.\nProje&ors confulted him on their fchemes. Poets\nfubmitted their works to his corre&ion. His\nvirtues, among which munificence was never\nforgot,\n*74 CHRYSALt OR, THE\nyGoogle\n\fforgot, were the inexhaufted theme of panegy-\nrick; and dedications declared to the world his\nabilities and knowledge.\nAdulation fo grofs was an affront to reafon.\nHe reje&ed, with juft contempt, the praifes to\nwhich he knew himfelf not entitled; and was\n\u00bfuperiour to the flattery, which compaflion for\nthe flatterer often made him feem to pay for.\nHappy had he always preferved the fame deli\u00ad\ncacy !\nAmong the crouds of parafites, who lay in\nwait thus for his favour, was a perfon, whom\nidlenefs feduced to prefer this abje& ftate of\ndependence to the purfuit of a liberal profeflion,\nwhich he had been bred tc\u2014 A bafenefs aggra\u00ad\nvated by his poiTefling every qualification neceffary\nto have made him eminent in any ftate.\nThis man, who had thoroughly ftudied the\nhuman heart, foon faw that any dire\u00a3l: attack\nupon his patron would prove ineffedual. He,\ntherefore, ftruck out a new fcheme, the depth\nof which fecured it from dete&ion, though, at\nthe fame time, the difficulty of carrying it into\nexecution would have difcouraged any one, lefs\nanxious for fuccefs, and confident of his own\nabilities. He difguifed the ftrongeft flattery\nunder the mafque of the moft cynical bluntnefs\nand candour ; and inftead of praifing all he did,\nand echoing in affent every word he fpoke, he\nmilled no occafion of differing in opinion with\nhim, declaring he thought that being, who\ncould\nADVENTURES OF A GUINEA. *75\nyGoogle\n\fcould debate the dignity of his nature fo far as\nio give up his judgement to another, from\nany other motive than rational convi&ion, un*\nworthy of the name of man.\nA behaviour fo fingular neceffarily attra&ed\nthe notice of his patron* as the manner in\nwhich it was carried pn foon won his favour\nFor in all the debates of any moment, which\nthis champion for liberty of thought held with\nhim, he managed with fuch delicate art, as to\nlead him (his patron) to confute him, though\nfrequently contrary to the opinion with which\nhe had originally fet out. In trifles indeed, where\nbeing foiled could refle# no difgrace, he pro\u00ad\nceeded not with that caution, but often gained\na victory, for which he laughed at himfelf when\nit was won.\nBut with others he obferved not fuch modera\u00ad\ntion. Be the fubjeit what it would, he exerted\nall his powers (and great as I have faid they\nwere) till he filenced, at leaft, if he could not\nconvince his adverfary, over whom he then\ntriumphed in all the infolence of fuperiority.\nSuch a method could not fail of fuccefs ! His\npatron, fure of coming off with honour, fought\nevery opportunity of -entering into debate with\nhim, and contra&ed an efteem for one who, as\nhe thought, had thus difcovered to him his own\nabilities, while every one elfe declined entering\ninto a conteft, which always involved them in\ndifgrace.\nEncouraged\n\u00ab7* CHRYSAL: OR, THE\nyGoogle\n\fADVENTURES OF A OUINEA. **7\nEncouraged by thisfuccefs, he boldly ventured\ntipon a Aroke, the event of'Which was to decicte\nhis hopes. In gratification to his own depraved\ntafie, he had written a treatife, in which the\n\u2019groiTeft libertinifm was fet in fo advantageous\nand alluring a light, and the arguments againft\nit evaded with fo much plaufibility and true wit,\nas were almoft fufficient to put virtue out of\ncountenance, and debauch its fincereft votaries.\nThe contradidion between fuch principles\nand the pradice of his patron, through his whole\nlife, would have deterred any one lefs enter-\nprifing, and experienced in the weaknefles of\nhuman nature, from difclofing them ; but he had\nlately made fome difcoveries, which emboldened\nhim even to puih his defigns much farther, than\nowning himfelf the author of that book.\nWhile the vigour of life had enabled his patron\nto perfift in bufier purfuits, he had defpifed the\nflattery paid to his literary merits ; but as foon as\nthe infirmities of age rendered him unfit for fuch\nemployment, he with a natural partiality gave\nthe preference to that pre eminence which he\nthought ftill within his reach, and affeded to\nflight all fame, that was not founded on the\\\nnobler labours of the mind.\nThis was a fufficient diredion to the parafite.\nHe immediately ihovved his book, with a myfte-\nrious air, to feveral of his patron\u2019s friends*\ngiving them broad hints at the fame time, but\nunder the feal offecrecy, that he was the author ot\nVoL* III.

One whifpered it to another, till, in\na few days, the whole town was in the fecret.\nThe hints and allufions which were every hour\nthrown out to the patron, on this occafion, per\u00ad\nplexed him not a little, as he knew, not what\nthey meant. A fecret, though in the poffeffion\nof fo many, could not poffibly remain long fuch\nto him. One of his acquaintances, provoked at\nthe feeming affe\u00e2ation of his not underftanding\nhis hints, told him the whole affair.\nMuch as he was furprifed at the account,\nvanity would not let him fupprefs it by a diredfc\nnegative, as the book was mentioned in terms\nof the higheft praife. He anfwered with the\ncoy evaiions of modefty, the moft effe\u00e2ual\naffirmation, and ihifted off any further difcuffion\nof the fubje\u00e2, till he ihould be better in\u00ad\nformed.\nAccordingly, the moment his friend left him,\nhe fent for the author of the report, and charg\u00ad\ning him with it, defired to fee the performance\nwhich he had done him the honour to father\nupon him.\nThe parafite, who took his cue from the\nlooks of his patron, was far from denying the\ncharge. He prefented him the book without\nhefitation, faying, with his ufual bluntnefs, that\nif it was not a&ually written by him, it was\nliterally written from him, being nothing but\nwhat he had frequently faid on thofe fubje&s ;\nyGoogle\n\fand, therefore, might without any injuftice be\nafferted to be his.\nThe advantageous manner in which the patron\nhad heard the book fpoken of prevented his\nmaking any reply, till he ihould have read it,\nwhen he was fo ftruck with the various beauties\nof it, that vanity fubdued all his virtue, and\ndeprived him of the power of denying it. 4\n4 If\n4\n4 the fentiments are mine !\u201d (faid he, bluihing\nat his own bafenefs, as he fpoke) 4\n4 I am\n4\n4 obliged to you for placing them in fo ad-\n4\n4 vantageous a light; and think I ought tQ de-\n4\n4 dine iharing in an honour, fo much of which\n4\n4 belongs to another\/* \u25a0 - \u2014\nSuch a repulfe was no way difcouraging.\nThe parafite repeated his affertion that the whole\nwas genuinely his, both in words and fenti\u00ad\nments, as indeed he knew not any other, whofe\nthey could be j and infilling that he had no\nmore merit in the affair, than barely that of\nwriting them down, a liberty for which he\nbegged pardon, appealed to his former condudt\nto acquit him of fo mean a piece of flattery, as\ngiving to another the honour of a work, which\nhad not its equal.\nIt is not difficult to perfuade a willing m-ind.\nThe patron could no longer deny what was fo\nclearly proved; and what his own confcience\nbore teftimony to, againft his falfe modefty.

O f this you fee the ftrongeft in-\nftance which this age has afforded, in that\nman, who fits at the left hand of the fuperiour,\nwrapped up in the confcioufnefs of his own\nimportance, and fmiling contemptuoufly at the\ncompany around him, while they believe he is\njoining in their mirth.\nA particular account of his life would lead\ninto too great a length. It would feem a\nfatire on mankind, rather than a detail of the\naftions of one man. However, as a ihort\niketch of it may be of advantage, by unveiling\nthis myftery in the conduit of Heaven; and\nproving the infufficiency of the higheft profpe-\nrity to confer happinefs, even in the hour of\nattainment, when that profperity is not founded\nin, and procured by virtue, I will juft run\nover the great heads of his ftory, with that\nbrevity which the difagreeablenefs of the fub-\njeitnaturally diitates.\nThe opening of his life gave no profpeit of\nhis exalted ftation. Fleafure in every licen\u00ad\ntious excefs foon diffipated a fmall patrimony;\nand he was hardly entered into man\u2019s eftate,\nwhen want, of his own earning, began to ftare\nhim in the face.\nThe peculiar caft of a man's mind is in\nnothing more ftrongly ihown, than in the ex\u00ad\npedients he has recourfe to, in order to extri\u00ad\ncate him from difficulties. Inftead of quitting\nthe\n,yGoogle\n\fthe vices which had brought him into this\ncmbarraflment, he refolvcd on the firft alarm to\nbuild his hopes of fortune on them, by pur-\nfuing them in a different manner. Expe\u00ad\nrienced in all the myfteries of intrigue, he\nknew that age and deformity will purchafe\npleafures, for which youth and beauty expe<9:\nto be flattered, if not even paid. Unreftrained,\ntherefore, by any fcruples of honour or con-\nfcience, he dire\u00a3Hy determined to fix upon\nfome wealthy female of the former clafs, and\nnever doubted making her paflion repay him\nmanifold what he had expended on the gra\u00ad\ntification of his own.\nI fee the abhorrence with which the men\u00ad\ntion of fuch a fcheme ftrikes you. Venal\nproftitution in the female fex, though cut off\nfrom every other method of prolonging a\nwretched exiflence, is the loweft ftate to which\nit can fink.

Such a quarry engaged all his at\u00ad\ntention in the purfuit. He paid his addreiTes\nto her, though defiitute of every thing that\ncould raife natural defire, with fo much\naffiduity and warmth, that Ihe readily re\u00ad\nceived him into her good graces ; and, in r*-\nturn fo r the pleafure Jhe foun d in his converfation,\nlavifhed her fortune upon him with a profufion\nthat even exceeded his hopes.\nFrom the principle on which he fet out,' it\nmay be judged that he did not negleft to im\u00ad\nprove fuch an opportunity of repairing his\nbroken fortunes, and laying up a fund for a\nfuture day, out of the overflowing of her\nuntimely fondnefs. But, unbounded as her\ngenerofity was, he was far from being con\u00ad\ntent, while any thing further remained poffi-\nble to be got from her. Befide the great\nwealth which was dire&ly in her power, a\nvery large eftate was by family-fettlements to\ndefcend to an only daughter, whom ihe had\nby her hufband. As foon, therefore, as her\nmodeft lover had \\got pofleflign of the former,\nhis heart yearned for the latter alfo, with as\nmuch greedinefs, as if his wants were only\nencreafed by his acquifitions.\nBut, though he was feldom long at a lofs\nfor means to accomplifh any thing he had in\n5 view,\nDigitized by C j O O ^ I c\n4 C t t R Y S A L t OR, T HE\n\fview, as he was under no reftraint from priiv-\nciple in the choice of them, there was an ob-\nftacle in his\" way here, which all the fertility\n. of his genius could not furmount. This was\nhis connexion with the mother, the nature of\nwhich he well knew would never let her con-\nfent to a fcheme deftru&ive of itfelf; for he\nbad no fear of her making oppofition froth\nmotives of honour or virtue to any thing that\ndid not claih with that, as he found none in\nhis own confcience even to this, though con\u00ad\ntrary to the firft principles of nature.\nSince he could not, therefore, get the daugh\u00ad\nter^ whole fortune, by marrying her, he re-\nfolved to exert his influence on her mother,\nto give her' to fome perfon of his choofing,\nwho ihould divide it with him, as a recom-\npenfe for making the match. For this pur-\npofe, he pitched upon a near relation of his\nown, who readily gave into his fcheme, though\npoflefled himfelf of a fortune that placed\nhim above the neceility of (looping to fuch\nmeannefs. The confent of the guardian-\nmother, as he forefaw, was eafily obtained.\nShe was happy in having fuch an opportunity\nof proving her regard for him, as well as\nof removing her daughter out of his reach,\nhis attention to whom, while his firft projeft\nwas in his head, had not efcaped her jealous\nnotice.\nB 3 His\nADVENTURES OF A GUINEA.

Nor did he apprehend any op-\npofitiore to this fcheme from the fame quar\u00ad\nter that had defeated the former. He had\nnow gotten from her all that (he had to .\ngive; and the fame principle which prompted\nhim to be the hired drudge of her loofe defires\nmade himfind no fcruple to leaveher fervice, when\nIhe was no longer able to pay the wages of it.\nNothing is eafier than to make matter for,\ndifpute.

This\ndrew on him an epiftolary torrent of upbraid-\nings, expoftulations, and at laft,- of the moft\ntender intreaties; but all were equaHy inef\u00ad\nfectual.

In that light (he\ntook them. However, as the nature of the\naffair made it improper for her to open her mind\ntoo explicitly, ihe refolved to play his own game\nback upon him, and affeCt to be convinced by\narguments of whichfhehoped to take advantage\nat a proper time, though in a manner very dif\u00ad\nferent from his intention, in applying them.\nB 4 ' C H A P .\n,yGoogle\n\f8 CHRYSAL: OR, THE\nC H A P .

Born in the middle rank of\nlife, his parents were induced by the dawn-\nings of uncommon genius, which he discover\u00ad\ned in his earlieft youth, to 'give him fuch an\neducation, as might enable him to make that\nfigure in fome of the learned profeflions, for\nwhich paternal fondnefs flattered them, that\nnature had defigned him.\nBut, however greatly he profited by his\neducation, the end propofed by it was far from\nbeing pleafing to his inclinations, which the\nrigour of his mind and body turned to more\na&ive Scenes. For this reafon, when he was\nto quit the purfuits of general learning for thofe\nof fome particular profeflion, his ardour cool\u00ad\ned, and he entirely loft that fpirit of emulative\nambition, which alone can enable a man to ar\u00ad\nrive at eminence.\nSuch a falling-ofF could not efcape the\nanxious obfervation of his friends, but as it was\nnot in their power either to remedy it, or gratify\nhis inclination in any other way, all they could\ndo\n>ogle\n\fdo was, to enter him into the fervice of religion,\naproFeflion in which, though thegreateft abili\u00ad\nties and application of the human mind are\nevidently and indifpenfibly neceflary, yet, by the\nperverfion of man, the lead are required.\nYou fecm (hocked at the feverity of this\nremark j but a moment\u2019s reflexion will open to\nyou the reafon upon which it is founded. In\nevery other profeflion, fuccefs depends upon\nan opinion of that knowledge, which is-called\nm erit in it, becaufe mankind fee the neceflity of\nfuch merit to attain the object of the profeflion.\nBut in the church, the cafe is quite different.\nEvery man thinks that he knows enough of re\u00ad\nligion to ferve his own turn, and therefore gives\nhimfelf no trouble about the knowledge of thofe\nwho profefs it, as he concludes that knowledge\ncan be of no fervice to him ; and therefore fu c\u00ad\ncefs in the church depends not on a general opinion o f\nm erit, but on particular favou r, w hich, fo r the\nreafon given before, is not the neceffary confequence\no ffuch m erit. An attorney, or furgeon, for in-\nftance, who is not thought to have fome merit\nin his profeflion, will never be employed 5 but\nlet him by any means get into the church, and\ncurry favour with thofe in power, and he may\nrife to the firft dignities of it, though he has no\nmore merit in this profeflion, than he had in\nthat which he was forced to quit for want of\nbread. And this is the reafon, why they who\nH 6 have\nADVENTURES OF A GUINEA. 155\n,yGc \u25a0 le\n\fhave lea f abilitiesfo r any profeffton are packed inU\nthis; and why they, again, who have the le a f o f\nthefe, are generally m of fuccefsfid in it\\ as con\nfcioufnefs of their want of merit makes them\ntake moft pains to gain favour.\nThe confequences of his entering into fuch a\nprofeflion againft inclination are obvious. An\nindignant fenfe of his own natural fuperiority\nto his fuperiours in ftation made him fall into\nthe too common errour of arguing from the abufey\nagainft the ufe, and hold in contempt not only\nthem, but alfo the very profeflion itfelf, in\n\u2022which they could have fuch fuccefs, and in\nwhich neceflity alone obliged him to continue\u00bb\nHe difdained to apply abilities, which he thought\nabove the end! He neglected duties which\nhe fawahufed; and at length funk into a ftate\nof liftlefs indifference, in which he would have\ndied in obfcurity, had not diftrefs roufed him,\nand extorted an exertion of his abilities, which\na mind foured by difappointment cf its earljeft\nhopes, and by domeftick unhappinefs after,\nturned tofa tire, with an afperity and ftrength\nthat made vice tremble in the bofom of the great,\nand folly hide her head in the higheft places.\nAs this domeftick unhappinefs was the im\u00ad\nmediate caufe of thofe parts of his conduit\nwhich contradi&ed the general tenour of his\nchara&er, juftice requires that fome account\nfliould be given of it.

He married\nher, though, in the phrafe of the world, evi\u00ad\ndently to his ruin, the return ihe made him for\n\\yhich proof of his love, was* infidelity to his\nbed. This is the deepeft wound that can be\ngiven to an heart of any delicacy; it ihar-\npens the fling of ingratitude with infult*\nby giving a preference that reflects difhonour.\nHe felt it fo feverely, that defpair made him\nftrive to drown the fenfe of it in wine, in the\nintoxication of which, he too often was guilty\nof what, in a cooler moment, his reafon would\nhave bluihed at, and his principles abhorred $\nand this was the chief caufe of that diftrefs alfo,\nwhich, as I obferved, forced him to exert his\nabilities, which he did with fuch fuccefs, as\nfoon enabled him to quit a profeflion that had\nnot been his choice, and at the fame time in\u00ad\ndulge the natural difpofition of his heart, by\npraftifing fome of the fublimeft duties of it.\nAs foon as he awoke next day, he went to\nvifit his new family, where the happinefs that\ngliftened in every grateful eye, at his approach,\nmade him happy.
