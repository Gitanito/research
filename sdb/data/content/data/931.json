How comes itto pafte that thefe Heterogene*\n. Otis Ferments removing thus by the force of Refuf-\n. citated Nature, do not terminate in Apoftemes,\nof iffue out infome grofl'e Body; but go out in a\nvapour andinvifibly ?\n2. How comes all this to happen in fo fhort a\n- time?\nT o the firft I anfwer $ That it is not unufuall for Na\u00ad\nture to difeharge her felf of Heterogeneous Ferments\nby infenfible Tranfpiration * as well as Apoftemes,\nSweat, Diarrhaea, and Urine: fo the Mefels arecored:\nfo many Crude andhard Tumours:: and in this Plague\nfew fvvellings broke, yet were they cured. Nor is it to\nbe (aid, that the matteroccafioningthofe T umours was\ndifeuffed fo as to be reimbibed intbe blood againe: for\nin the Plague the recurfesofthe Peftilentiall Ferment\nareMortall: and fuch as took Powders and Antidotes\ngently promoting a Diaphorefis, (not fweatj efcapcd:\nthey who did not, dyed with thofe Bubones. It is\naneffe<ftof prejudice occafioned by the contemplati\u00ad\non of the ufuall effeds of Nature \u00bb and not of Rea-\nfon, to imagine that the Morbifique caufe confifts ina\ngrofle Body, becaufe it is often evacuated fo*' Itis\nufuall for thofe fubtileFerments fo to commix them-\nfelves, and to occafion that tranfpofition of Parts and\nTexture, that Naturecannot eje& the one without the\nexpenfe ofthe other. Thus wefee that Beer or Ale in\nits Fermentation or Working cafts out ahoundance of\nBarme,yet isnot that Body the Ferment,but it isimpli\u00ad\ncated and incorporated ^herewith, for with ic there\nJn accounto\nf\nMr Gre atar i ck^\n\fIfTues one aboundance of Beare, fo that the Brewers\neither pover the fame,or new inagain to fill up the Bar-\nrel. If the fame Ferment be precipitated by Vineger,or\nAllome, there is not the like diminution. So Ktrgtrus\nfaith,that in Germanythey put common Salt, or cold\nWater into their Bear, and precipitating the Ferment\nmake it potable prefently. Many fucn inftances are\nto befound in Dr VViRit and Kw\nhich fufficien\nevince that the Ferment is diftinft from the grofle\nBody it comes out in. So in Difeafes, however fome\nhave vainly imagined to themfelves a maturation of\nthemi and that the Morbifique matter being conco&ed\niflucd out in that white Hypoftafis at the end of Di-\nfeafes; yet is it no fuch thing, nor is there any fuch con*\ncotfion in Nature as they phanfy: but the Morbifique\nmatter or Ferment, being intimately commixed with\nfome good and profitable parts of the Blood and Hu\u00ad\nmours, is eje&ed together with them, according to the\nnature of the Eumu&ory, by which the Crifis or Me*\ntaflaiis is made, or the nature ofthe Bodies constituting\nthat humour. Nature dealing therein juft as (he does\nin the Fermentation o f Beer and Wine, in the afore*\nfaid Merger, and D> W\ni\nl\nl\ni\nsjwhence proceed their\nwayes of curing Agues by Precipitation of the Morbi\u00ad\nfique Ferment, without any fuch Evacuations of grofle\nBodies. This Paradox appeares further by the (everal\nCrifesof DUeafes, fometimes by Vomit, fometimes\nby Stoole, fometimes by bleeding at the Nofe, and\nSweat. In all which circumftances the Urine fhew one\nfort of Conco&ion, whilft the Morbifique Ferment\n* ifl'uesout feverall wayes in feverall Bodies* Nor is it\nD to\nand hit Miraculous Cures. >9\n\fto b\u00a3doubted I chink that all grofle bodyed Ferments\nhave their Virtue and efficacy from a fubtile Body\nwhich is no more inthat grofle Body, then the Spirit\nof Sugar is in Sugar: of which See \\^dngelus Salas\nSucburologU: many other inftances might be given,\nas that, if the grand Eerment were agrofle Body, how\ncomes it to evaporate (as I have feen in the Diftiilati-\non of Sugar, Sugar-cande-juyce, and other Liquors\nFermented for Spirits) without any diminutionof the\nLiquors ? From all which it appears that one may\nconceivehow upontheefficaciousToach of Mr\ntaricksyhe refufeitatingthe Blood andinnate Tempera\u00ad\nment, the Morbifiqne Ferment may be ejected-, and\nthe remaining grofle Body^by a Tranfpofition ofits\nTexture andanew impregnation of Vitality be reim\u00ad\nbibed into the Blood, and become nutritious.' Thus\nhe cures Afthmas, all the obftru&ions from impa&ed\nphlegme in the Lungs being difeharged, and the\nphlegme Naturalifed. But it the grofle body of the\nMorbifiqne matter beIncorrigible and Preternaturall j\nthentheefficacy of his Touch doth not efifeufle them,\nbut the flrengthningthe part and Nature, the whole\ncollection is leparated and ripened , as I obferved:\nwhichappears in Wenns, and fcrophulous Tumours?\nforac whereofhe maturates, andothers aredifeufl'ed. V\nTothefecond Queftion, how all this happens in\nfo (hort a time ?, I anfwer, that it is.the efficacy of\ntheFerment implanted in Me GreAixrfcks Body.
