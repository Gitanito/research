Raivson.\nI.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nBy Henry G. Rawson, Barrister at Law.\nThe experiments which I am about to describe were carried out by\nmyself and a small party of intimate friends of my own, for whose\nbonafides I can vouch. The accounts of each occasion were compiled\nfrom notes taken at the time, and\u2014with the exception of the first two\ndays' experiments\u2014written out fully the same evening, and in each\ncase all the experiments made are recorded.\nI may mention that some years ago I forwarded to the Society the\nrecord of some experiments of mine which were printed in the Journal\nS.P.R., Vol. III., pp. 147 and 182, and, subsequently, some criticisms\nfrom my personal experiences upon a theory of Mr. Downing's, which\nwere printed in the Journal, Vol. III., p. 192.\nSince that date I have had few opportunities of renewing my\nexperiments. The fact also that I found myself almost invariably less\nsuccessful in every series of experiments after the first with any agent\nrather discouraged me, or dulled my interest in persevering. It may,\nhowever, be worth mentioning that in one exceptional case, a lady\nwith whom I have had three series of experiments in guessing playing-\ncards, the results, allowing myself 2 guesses each time, have been 7\nright out of 12, 7 out of 12 (a second time), and 9 out of 18. Except\nin this last instance, I have never been able to get a clear concept\n(mental or visual) of any card at all after the 12th. Several cards\nwould persist in recurring together. I say \" mental or visual,\" because\nin my experience it has been sometimes one, sometimes the other.\n'When most successful I have distinctly seemed to see the card.\nN.B.\u2014I always shut my eyes when guessing.\nI may mention that the ladies who took part in the experiments\nwhich I am about to describe were quite clear that the interposition\nof a solid or opaque body (such as a screen) between them, or the\nshutting of her eyes by the percipient, increased the difficulty, and\nsome unsuccessful experiments I remember apparently resulted from\none or other of these causes. There were, however, many cases, e.g.,\nthose witnessed by \" Z.,\" where in spite of one or other of these\nimpediments the experiment was successful.\n\fExperiments in Thought-transference. 3\n,\nI have been anxious to prosecute the experiments in this direction,\nbut opportunity has been wanting.\nIf, as some maintain, thought moves by way of undulations (or\n.vibrations) in some medium more subtle than ether which can\npermeate to the brain, the interposition of an obstacle may interfere\nwith those undulations. The result of my experiments when an\nobstacle has been interposed shows that it does not arrest them\nentirely, and at the same time proves, to my satisfaction at any rate,\nthat the success of the experiments cannot be attributed to collusion.\nIt may also be worth mentioning that after an hour or less of\nexperiments, my friends frequently complained of headache, and for\nthis reason, partly, our seances were discontinued after the series\nnow recorded.\nNovember 24th, 1894.\u2014The first evening was occupied with\nexperiments in the transference of diagrams, Mrs. L. and Mrs. B.,\n(who are sisters) being the operators, and myself the only other\nperson present.\nThe positions on that occasion were throughout as follows :\u2014Mrs.\nL. sat on a low chair by the fire, drawing in her lap ; Mrs. B. sat\nsome distance off at a table in the middle of the room, with her back\nto Mrs. L. ; and I stood almost between them with my back to the\nfire, looking occasionally over Mrs. B.'s shoulder. To the best of my\nrecollection, I never saw Mrs. L.'s drawings until they were complete\nand handed up for comparison.\nFrom the sitters' positions, it was impossible that they could look\nover one another, and as one was sitting throughout with her back to\nthe other, some eight feet distant, no collusion was possible. In one\ncase only, that of the fern-palms (No. 6, see p. 5), was anything\nsaid except, \" Oh ! I know what she is thinking of,\" or words to\nthat effect, which the percipient exclaimed on two or three occasions\nalmost immediately the agent began drawing, and at once commenced\nher own sketch. All the diagrams drawn by both agent and\npercipient are reproduced below, those of the agent being marked O.,\nand those of the percipient, R. In the first three, Mrs. B. was agent,\nand in the last three, Mrs. L. No. 2 (the triangle) was the only one\nsuggested by me, and also the only instance in which there was a\nfailure. In this case alone some additions were made subsequently\nto the percipient's drawing by myself, showing how a kind of\ntriangle was to be seen in the figure of the cat. At that time I had\nnot thought of reproducing the record. The agent then made some\nadditions to her sketch, but in the reproductions which accompany\nthis paper, both diagrams are given as originally drawn. The other\ndiagrams were chosen by the agent in every case without communi\ncation with any one and were drawn in the positions I have indicated.\nB 2\n\f\fExperiments in Thought-transference. 5\nNovember 29<A, 1894.\u2014Present, Mr. and Mrs. L. and myself.\nExperiments with playing-cards, a complete pack being used. At first\nthe card was selected by Mrs. L., but after the first two or three\nexperiments I suggested that it should be obtained by cutting the\npack, the card thus coming to the bottom being the one to be guessed.\nThis in the first place makes collusion by pre-arrangement more\ndifficult, and also renders less probable a complication I have noticed\nelsewhere, arising, I presume, from the apparent -difficulty of concen\ntrating the thoughts on one card when the agent has just seen and\nrejected others. A curious phenomenon resulted from this on two\noccasions (previously recorded, see Journal S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 148)\nviz., that I guessed a card which the agent had for a moment intended\nto choose and then changed her mind. In neither case did the card\nshe actually selected present itself to my \" mind's eye \" at all.\nThe plan we adopted on the present occasion was, if the first\nguess was wrong, for the agent to say \" No,\" or \" Wrong.\" I found,\nhowever, that the tone in which this was said might sometimes convey\nan impression that the guess was nearly correct, or otherwise, so I\nusually adopted the course of seeing the card myself and giving alone\nthe answer \"No \" (\"Wrong \"), or \" Yes \" (\"Right \"). It will be noticed\nthat in the large majority of instances, when Mrs. L., Mrs. B., or\nMr. L. was the percipient, the first guess was correct.\n\fc Henry G. Rawson.\nAs an almost invariable rule when either Mrs. B. or Mrs. L. was\nthe percipient, I was the only person in the room who knew the right\ncard except the agent, the reason for my looking at it being that\nwhich I have stated. In the few cases when I was percipient, I\nbelieve that it was shown to both Mrs. L. and Mrs. B.\nThe following is the complete record of the experiments made.\n(1) Mrs. L. agent; Mr. Rawson percipient.\nCard drawn.

I was told by him and Mrs. L. that they had frequently\ntried the experiment before, and that he was almost invariably right.\nHe said, however, that it tired him, and he did not take part in many\nof our seances.\nDecember 5th, 1894.\u2014Present, Mr. and Mrs. L., Mrs. B., Miss B.\n(a sister of the other two ladies), and myself.\nExperiments with playing cards ; conditions the same as on previous\nevening.

In the second ex\nperiment, she said, \" It is either Ace of Hearts or Ace of Diamonds.\"\nNow I had been shown the card, which was Ace of Hearts. I\nsaid, \" Wait a little and see which it is.\" After 5 seconds she said,\n\" Ace of Diamonds.\" \" Right,\" said Mrs. L. I then pointed out that\nit was Ace of Hearts. \"Oh,\" she said, \"I thought it was Ace of\nDiamonds.\" The next four were right at the first guess. Mrs. B. did\nnot guess the suit first, like Mr. L.\n(3) Mrs. L. agent, Mr. Rawson percipient.\nCard drawn.

With one exception noted (No. 3) I\nwas the only person, except the percipient, who did not remain seated.\n\f8 Henry G. Rawson.\nIn order to see better what happened I occasionally walked from place\nto place. The percipient could in every case, except No. 4, see every\none in the room (all were requested to concentrate their thoughts on\nthe thing to be done), but no indication could well have been given by\nanyone without my noticing it, as I could see where the percipient\nlooked. I never noticed the slightest attempt to give any indication\nwithout noting it. Any such indication is recorded below.\n(No. 1.) Mrs. L. was sent out of the drawing-room. I suggested and\nMrs. B. agreed, and we then informed Miss B. and Mr. L. of our\ndecision, that Mrs. L. should take up the hearth-brush and sweep\nthe hearth. At my suggestion Mrs. B. sat beside me on a sofa on the\nfurther side of the room from the door and adjoining the fire-place\nwhere we had been sitting during previous experiments. Mr. L. and\nMiss B. sat on a sofa between the door and the fire-place. Mrs. L.\nwas then called into the room. In this and all similar cases I\nsummoned the percipient, and found her in the dining-room some\ndistance away and quite out of hearing. After walking into the\nroom she stood still for half a minute, then said : \" I know,\" and\nwalked to the fire and took up the brush. Some 30 seconds later\nshe swept the hearth.\n(No. 2.) Miss B. went out and the other three of us agreed, at my\nsuggestion, (Mr. L. not knowing what was arranged) that she should\nring the bell on left of fire-place. On this occasion I took notes\nand did not attempt to will. I may note here that our experiments\nseemed to shew that neither Mr. L. nor I could transfer our thoughts\nto any of the ladies, either in these or card experiments, and that\nMrs. B. took the leading part in \" willing.\" She had no idea of her\npower till some experiments ten days previously, which I did not record.\nMiss B. did as willed in about a minute.\n(No. 3.) Mrs. L. out; the other four agreed that she should kneel\non a certain chair (which was first moved out of position and then\nreplaced by me before she came in, lest its altered position should\nattract her attention) and take up a book near it on a table.\nAfter coming into the room, and standing still for a minute or less,\nMrs. L. said : \" You want me to go down on my knees, but I won't.\"\nAs she continued to stand still for 2 or 3 minutes, Mrs. B., who had\nbeen sitting beside me on the sofa, got up and stood beside, but not\ntouching her. In 15 seconds Mrs. L. moved towards the right chair,\nsat on it, and took up the right book. Mrs. B. said, once or twice :\n\" You must do it,\" in an authoritative voice. I have noticed the same\ntone sometimes from Mrs. L. to Mr. L. in card-reading\u2014as if she\nconsidered it a question of will, or, at any rate, of earnest persuasion.\n(No. 4.) Mrs. L. was sent into the dining-room, where I had\nnoticed some walnuts, with other dessert dishes, on a what-not (second\n\fExperiments in Thought-transference. Jr\nstorey, not top). I suggested she should be willed to crack one. It\nwas arranged that I alone should follow her to the dining-room, the\nothers remaining in the drawing-room, tell her we had settled some\nthing, and watch her. The only words that passed were her question :\n\"Are you willing also?\" and my reply: \"I am thinking of the thing.\"\nIn less than 30 seconds she said : \" Have I to crack a nut V There\nwere no nuts but walnuts there.\nI made notes of these experiments at the time, read them over, and\nall those present initialled them as correct. The above account, written\nlater the same evening, is a faithful amplification of the notes.\nDecember 12th, 1894. Present : Mrs. L., Mrs. B., and myself.\nWe tried first experiments with drawings, all of which are repro\nduced below.

In some 10 seconds\nMrs. B. began drawing, and was finished within 15 seconds of Mrs. L.\n\f\fExperiments in Thought-transference. 11\n(No. 2) This was more like a foot at first, but while waiting for\nMrs. L. to begin a fresh subject Mrs. B. began shading the boot\u2014\nwithout thinking\u2014and this accentuates the dissimilarity. This and\nthe case mentioned on November 24th, are the only instances in which\nthe drawing was touched after the original had been seen.\n(No. 4) Mrs. L. said almost at once\u2014after, say, 10 seconds\u2014\"Now\nI know what it is ; I am sure ; I can see it.\"\n(No. 5) Mrs. L. began drawing within 10 to 15 seconds, and pre\nsently said, \" I am drawing something I can see.\" The clock was in\nfront of her on the mantelpiece.\n(No. 6) Mrs. L. said \" I know what it is.\"\nAfterwards Mrs. B. told me that she thought of putting a\nlabel on the champagne bottle she drew (No. 4).\nWe then had some \" willing \" experiments. In each case I suggested\nwhat should be done. First Mrs. L. went out ; the others remained\nseated in each experiment. We settled she should walk to a bracket\nglass at the side of the room, look into it, and sniooth her hair.\nAfter standing in the middle of the room some 30 seconds she\nturned left half face, walked to the glass, pausing once or twice on the\nway, looked at herself, caught sight of me in the glasss and made a\nbow to me. Experiment not further proceeded with.\nNext Mrs. B. went out. We decided she should walk to the end of\nthe room, take a flower-pot off its stand and put it on the floor.\nShe walked straight up to the pot and, after 10 seconds, said, \" Do\nyou want me to draw the blind up ?\" I said \" No, think again.\" In\nabout 30 seconds she said, suiting the action to the word, \" Do you\nwant me to put the pot on the floor 1 \"\nNext Mrs. B. went out. We decided she should sit down at the\npiano and play. She came straight in, sat down at the piano and said, \" I\ndon't knowanything to play.\" (N.B.\u2014She plays rather well by memory.)\nI said \" Wait a little.\" In 5 seconds she struck three or four discor\n\f12 Henry 0. Rawson.\ndant notes with a laugh. It would have been interesting to will her to\nplay something particular. A final experiment to make her do some\nthing in another room failed altogether ; she said she could think of\nnothing.\nThe following are some experiments with cards which came next.\n(1) Mrs. L. agent, Mr. L. percipient.\nCard drawn.

(These three Mrs.\nB. selected to see if it would\nconfuse the percipient. For all\nthe others the pack was cut as\nusual, and the bottom card\ntaken.)\nKing of Diamonds, King of Spades\nDecember 13th, 1894.\u2014I arranged to try some experiments this\nafternoon with Mrs. L. and Mrs. B., in the presence of a friend,\nof mine, a clergyman, whom I will call Z., aged about 70. I\nwas not surprised that in the presence of a stranger we did not have\nanything like the success of previous experiments, but to my great\nsatisfaction my friend, who was an entire sceptic, guessed or \" saw \"\nthree cards right himself.\n\fExperiments in Thought-transference. 13\nWe were sitting thus :\u2014\nDoor\nFireplace\nMrs. L.\nx\nx Mr. R.\nx Mrs. B.\nx\nZ.\nMrs. L. was guessing ; I cut the cards in each case and handed them\nto Mrs. B. The first guess was :\n10 of Hearts (right)\nthe second :\n5 of Diamonds (right) ;\nwhen Z., who had been sitting quiet, exclaimed, \" Positively, I thought\nof the 5 of Diamonds ! \" 'We then asked him to try. He shut his eyes\nand we all three saw the agreed card and \" willed.\" He made two\nsingle guesses :\nCard drawn. Card guessed.\n5 of Diamonds Queen of Diamonds.\n7 of Clubs -9 of Spades.\nThe second being wide of the mark, we returned to Mrs. L. alone\nguessing, Mrs. B. holding the card ; but Z. continued with closed eyes\nto see what he might see.\nMrs. L. made the following guesses :\u2014\nCard drawn. Card guessed.\n(1 ) Queen of Hearts King of Clubs, King of Hearts.\n(2) 7 of Clubs 9 of Clubs.\n(3) 3 of Spades 3 of Diamonds, 3 of Clubs.\n(4) 5 of Clubs 4 of Clubs, 4 of Diamonds.\n(5) 7 of Hearts 7 of Hearts.\n(6) Knave of ClubB King of Clubs.\n\f14 Henry 0. Rawsoii.\nMeanwhile, it having been agreed that Z. should write down\nanything he saw, for\n(2) He wrote, \" 7 of Hearts.\"\n(3) As soon as Mrs. L. said \" 3 of Clubs \" (her second guess), I\nsaid \" No, 3 of Spades.\" To my astonishment, Z. broke out, in evident\nexcitement, \" Oh, why did you tell t I'll take my oath I saw the 3 of\nSpades ! I wish I had had time to write it down ! \" I should say it is\nextremely improbable that my friend has \" affirmed with an oath \" for\nmany a long year. I know him intimately, and never heard him use\n\" forcible language \" before! All the more did it impress me. He\nhad not got over the experience, and was still wondering what it\nmeant when we parted at midnight, the experiment having taken place\nabout 6 p.m.\n(4) He guessed 8 of Spades.\n(5) \u201e Queen of Hearts.\n(6) \u201e 9 of Clubs, Knave of Clubs\nHe had never seen or heard of this kind of experiment before 1 told\nhim of it the previous night, and started for our rendez-vous to-day quite\na sceptic.\nWe had three experiments first, before the above, Mrs. L. holding\nthe card, and Mrs. B. guessing.\nCard drawn. Card guessed.\nAce of Hearts Ace of Hearts\nA Spade Mrs. B. said \" A Spade ; I can see\n(number not recorded) no more.\"\nKing of Spades 10 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds.\nMrs. B. evidently was nervous before a stranger.\nWe then tried \" willing \" certain actions to be performed.\nMrs. L. went out. We decided she should lightthe further one of two\ncandlesticks on the piano. She walked straight to the candle, and after\npausing 2 minutes or so in the middle of the room, took it up and said,\n\" I don't at all know what to do with it.\" I said, \" You must think.\"\nAfter another minute she said \" You don't want me to light it 1\" The\nroom was brightly lit by electricity. This, by-the-way, was the second\nexperiment.\nIn the first, she was to put the cover on to the muffin dish, by which\nit lay on a tea table in the middle of the room.\nShe walked straight to the table, after a longish pause, perhaps 4\nminutes, and said, \" Do you want me to do anything to the cups 1 \" I\nsaid \" No.\" She then walked to a corner of the room, took up a\nChina cup, not one of the tea-set, and said, \" Am I to move this ?\nI feel as if I was to move the cups.\" She then gave up the\nexperiment.\n\fExperiments in Thought-transference. 15\nLastly we did some drawing, Mrs. L. first doing the originals. (See\nreproductions below.)\nIn the first, (No. 1), Mrs. B., after waiting some three minutes, said\n\"I can't think of anything.\" In about 15 seconds more she called me\nand said, \" Look here,\"\u2014pointing to a gilt four-leaved\nshamrock like this, which formed an ornament at the\ncorner of a picture frame in front of her, as she sat at\na table with her back to Mrs. L., who was drawing on\na book in her lap, the whole breadth of the room,\nsome 18 feet, behind her\u2014\"Look here, Mr. Rawson,\nI was looking vacantly before me and I noticed this. It's the only\nidea I have and I will draw it.\"\nWhen I looked at her drawing, I was astonished to see that she had\nonly drawn two leaves of the shamrock, and those the two which exactly\nresemble the interior of a sand-glass, which I found Mrs. L. had mean\nwhile completed. In this case no one present knew what Mrs. L. was\ndrawing. This seems to me a more tuggestive result than usual.\nThe resemblance might have been coincidental had she drawn her\nobject properly, but she seems to have been most unwittingly moved to\nomit two leaves and the stalk, which would have almost entirely robbed\nher sketch of its most singular resemblance to Mrs. L.'s drawing.\nSubject No. (2) I suggested to Mrs. L. Mrs. B. after waiting 5\nminutes said she could think of nothing and gave up, but presently she\nsaid \" I thought of an eye,\" but for some unexplained reason (probably\nnervousness of failure) she had not drawn it. She had then\nseen the circle with centre (O. 2) which Mrs. L. had drawn. The\neye Mrs. B. thought of might very conceivably have resembled\nthe \" circle with centre \" which I had suggested to Mrs. L. N.B.\u2014\nThis is the second time I have suggested a mathematical figure ;\u2014on\n\f16 Henry 0. Rawson.\nthe previous occasion (see first series) it was an equilateral triangle,\nwhich I suggested to Mrs. B.,\u2014and no result happened in either case.\nThese form the only two failures (if this be one) out of 15 recorded\nexperiments; The fact of my suggesting the subject is no absolute\nimpediment, as may be seen in previous experiments, e.g., the clock\nand champagne bottle on December 12th, and the match-box of the\nfollowing experiment.\nIn this, (No. 3), Mrs. B. drew the original at my suggestion. My\nsuggestions on this and other similar occasions were made in a whisper\npianissimo, and I can be certain Mrs. L. could not catch what I said,\n\u00ab.g., \" Draw a match-box.\"\nNow, the strange thing is that when her sketch was finished, Mrs.\nL., who is absolutely incapable of a pretence, said \" I don't know what\nI have drawn ; it's a kind of square inside a square.\"\nI think all will agree that hers is the more characteristic match-box\nof the two ; one with the luminous strip, to the life !\nThis is a return to our experience of the first night, November 24th,\nviz., that the idea was consciously or unconsciously reproduced (on this\noccasion unconsciously, for the only time) and not the particular repre\nsentation. E.g., on the first night the rings and the hands were quite\ndissimilar. But on December 12th the visual and not the mental con\ncept seemed sometimes to prevail, e.g, the foot which suggested a boot ;\nthe cylindrical paper basket which turned into a barrel. Per contra,\nhowever, the clocks and the chairs were unlike.\nI read this accompanying report of our experiments on December\n13th to Z., who asked me to add that on the occasion of the drawing,\nhe placed a chair between Mrs. L. and Mrs. B., so that the latter\ncould not, if she turned round, see what Mrs. L. was drawing in her lap.\nThe following statement was written and signed by Z., the terms\nbeing left entirely to himself :\u2014\nDecember 1ith, 1894.\n\" I wish to testify that to the best of my memory Mr. Rawson has\ngiven a correct account of the circumstances in connexion with the\nthought-readings at Mr. L.'s residence. It would seem to be almost\nimpossible, moreover, that it could have been by chance that I correctly\ntold the right card on three occasions out of about eight. But I must\nsay that I have an uneasy feeling of dislike to such sort of experiments,\nand that I do not feel disposed to enter further into them ; but would\nleave them to those who feel no such scruples.\"\nIt is worth remarking that the fact that Mrs. L. and Mrs. B. are\nalternately agent and percipient goes counter to the theory of l' willing \"\n(a fortiori of hypnotism), as it is unlikely that the weaker will could in\nturn control the stronger. Nor can I even accept with confidence the\nview that it is necessary that the agent should concentrate on the\n'\n\fExperiment* in Thought-transference. 17\nthought to be transferred, or should desire it to be guessed ; for, as\nalready mentioned, I have on two occasions guessed a card which\nthe agent had rejected in favour of another while selecting one to\nconcentrate her thoughts upon. This may be chance ; I must have\ntried to guess at least 100 cards on different occasions, and only recall\ntwo instances of this. For this reason, however, I usually ask the\nagent not to select a card, but to cut one to the bottom of the pack,\nso as to reduce the chance of her thinking of more than one card.\nMy view in all these experiments is that they are reducible to pure\nthought-transference, though I use the terms \" guessing \" and \" willing \"\nfor brevity, and though, in my opinion, concentration of thought is\nhighly desirable, and an apparent exercise of will facilitates success\u2014as,\nwhen Mrs. B. has sometimes exclaimed : \" You must guess it \" : \" You\nmust know what it is.\" The chief good of such expressions would, in\nmy -view, be to prevent the percipient from letting his mind wander, or\nfrom thinking of other things, which would probably be fatal to\nsuccess,\u2014unless for a sufficient interval he kept his mind a tabula rasa\nfor the transferred thought to impress itself upon.\nDoubtless the difficulty of getting success befilre strangers is due\n(as I have found myself as percipient) to the constant recurrence in the\npercipient's mind of an anxious dread of failure, and its resultant con\nsequences of suspicion on the part of the stranger as to the bona fides\nof previous results.\nOn a date subsequent to the above experiments I tried Mrs. B.\nthinking of a word which I suggested, and Mrs. L. guessing.\nThe first word selected was \" candle.\" After two or three minutes\nMrs. L. said, \"Is it electric light ? \" I said, \"Think again.\" In 10\nseconds she said .' Is it a candle ? \"\nNext I suggested \" theatre.\" After about 30 seconds she said \" Is\nit a play-house ? \" Strange that she should use a word which would\nbe quite unusual in the mouth of either herself, her sister, or me. I\nthought, however, that was near enough.\nThe experiment was then interrupted.\nc\n\f18 Dr. John Gordon Dill.\nII.\nDIPSOMANIA AND HYPNOTISM.\nBy John Gordon Dill, M.A., M.D.,\nAssistant Physician to the Sussex County Hospital.\nAmong the many disorders of the mind, one of the most prevalent\nin this country is that form of moral insanity which leads to\ndipsomania, and there is none which causes such widespread misery,\nor which leads oftener to crime. For in the course of his unfortunate\nlife, the drunkard not only becomes himself a physical and moral\nwreck, and in time swells the immense army of paupers and criminals,\nbut he is a perpetual source of grief and disgrace to his relations and\nfriends, and his children inherit from him in a marked degree an\nintellectual, a moral, or a nervous instability, which may hopelessly\ncripple them from their earliest years, or develop later into some\nneurotic disease. Now it cannot be too strongly insisted upon that\nhabitual drunkenness is a disease\u2014a moral, as opposed to an\nintellectual insanity,\u2014and that no matter how real the resolution to\nreform, or how intense the pangs of remorse for the past may be, it is\na positive fact that the power of resistance does not equal the\nimpelling force of the temptation and craving to drink. The drunkard,\nin other words, is not his own master.\nThe English law, unfortunately, does not recognise this, and the\npenalty for drunkenness serves to keep many a miserable being\nin existence, by the periods of enforced abstinence between his orgies,\nwhich he passes in prison. Nor has any system of treatment been\ndiscovered which can be relied upon, although innumerable specifics\nhave been introduced from time to time, only to be discredited after\ntrial. Certainly the power of resistance does increase during total\nabstinence, and, given the will to reform, a long period of compulsory\nabstinence has often the effect of getting rid of the craving to\ndrink, and the patient is cured if he remain a total abstainer ; but\neven thus, one glass of alcohol may be enough to restore the disease,\nand cases are by no means uncommon in which, after many years of\napparent cure, the patient has felt confident of his power to drink in\nmoderation, and the disease has returned. In so terrible and often\nhopeless a malady, the merest straw of possible salvation is naturally\ngrasped, and the encouraging results which hypnotism had given in\nthe hands of other observers led me to give it a trial.\nTime alone can prove the value of any treatment, even if it\nis apparently successful at the outset, and I shall therefore only record\n\fDipsomania and Hypnotism.\nthe results of the first few cases which came under my observation\nsome years ago, with their subsequent history as far as I have been\nable to trace it.\nCase L\u2014Mrs. J. was a lady between 40 and 50 years of age, a\nconfirmed drunkard, who had been deprived of the care of her\nchildren, and was subjected to more or less control. There was no\napparent wish to reform, but considerable violence and impatience of\nrestraint when the desire to drink was strong.\nI first saw her in 1886, and about a year later determined to try\nthe effects of hypnotism. She was not very susceptible, and the\nunconscious stage, which was not often reached during a course\nextending over many weeks, was not deep, but she became very much\nquieter, and the craving for drink abated for a time. It was thought\nwise, however, to place her under stricter surveillance in the country,\nand I have lost sight of her.\nI may here mention that I have noticed with some drunkards that\nthe craving for drink comes on with great intensity at more or less\nregular intervals, with periods of intermission, during which they may\nhave little or no temptation. Moreover, in the course of many cases,\nthis \" lucid interval \" appears in time to shorten, until it almost\ndisappears.\nCase II.\u2014A. W. was a housemaid, aged about 32, who had lost\nher character and her virtue by her drunken habits.\nI first saw her at \" St. Monica's Home,\" to which, at the time, I\nwas Honorary Physician. She was very readily hypnotised, and\nafter three or four suggestions that she should dislike all forms of\nalcohol and be unable to take it, she lost all desire for drink.\nEventually a situation in a gentleman's family was found for her,\nwhich she has retained for the past six years, and she is a most valued\nand trusted servant.\nIt is worth notice, that when she was suffering from influenza and\nhad been ordered port wine by another medical man who was\nattending her, she resisted strenuously, and deceived her mistress by\npouring it away.\nCase III.\u2014Miss I. was a well connected woman, whose relations\nhad disowned her, and who had found a temporary asylum in the\nHome above mentioned.\nAlthough she really wished to be cured, I was unable to produce\nthe slightest effect upon her, nor were two other more experienced\nhypnotists than myself, who very kindly came with me to see her,\nmore successful.\nA curious point about this case was that the craving for drink\ncame on with a hallucination that she could smell brandy, and then,\nnothing could stop her drinking.\nc 2\n\f20 Dr. John Gordon Dill.\nCase IV.\u2014Captain A., an officer retired from the army, had been\nan inebriate for at least nine years. Mr. Hugh Wingfield, who\nhappened to be at Brighton, very kindly came with me to see him,\nand at his first visit attempted hypnotism, and managed to render\nCaptain A. powerless to get up from his chair. He then arranged to\nsee him again the next morning, but unfortunately during the night\nCaptain A. developed the first symptoms of an attack of pneumonia,\nwhich became complicated by delirium tremens. After six weeks of\na most dangerous illness I advised him to go to Cambridge, and to put\nhimself under Mr. Wingfield, who had most kindly offered to do all he\ncould for him, but apparently he had become quite insusceptible to\nhypnotism. He had been a total abstainer during his convalescence,\nbut after leaving Cambridge he relapsed into his former habits, and\nI have since heard of his death.\nCase V.\u2014Mrs. P., a lady aged about 55, had contracted habits of\nintemperance during a period of great domestic anxiety. I had very\nfew opportunities of hypnotism, but the effect appeared to be good at\nthe time, and although I have seen very little of her during the past\nfew years, she has never, to my knowledge, caused any scandal by a\nrelapse, though it is quite possible that she may drink secretly.\nCase VI.\u2014Captain B., a retired officer of the navy, aged 42, had\nbeen a drunkard for years. Although a wealthy man, he was\naccustomed to leave home when he began to drink hard, and would\nsometimes return covered with vermin, and without having changed\nhis clothes since the day he went away.\nHe expressed no wish to reform, and although he was treated\nunder my direction by a most experienced hypnotist, he was not very\ndeeply affected, nor was absolute unconsciousness ever reached. At\nthe same time he was quieter and more reasonable during the course of\nhypnotism, but after a few weeks he grew tired of it, and had a\nrelapse shortly afterwards.\nCase VII.\u2014Mrs. A., aged 40, was the widow of a clergyman.\nThe discovery of her failing had been made during the life of her\nhusband, and for a time all forms of alcohol were kept from her, but\nwhen his decease took place, she bribed one of the undertaker's men\nto put a bottle of brandy into the coffin when it was brought into the\nhouse, and then got drunk in the room with the corpse.\nI first saw her some years later, when she had been rescued from\nthe lowest depth of depravity by her sister. She was treated by the\nhypnotist mentioned in the last case, and was easily influenced, but\nalthough a post-hypnotic suggestion that any alcoholic liquor would\nmake her violently sick was effectual for about three days, at the end\nof that time it had apparently quite passed away, nor did repeated trials\nlengthen the period during which it took effect. This could not be\n\fDipsomania and Hypnotism. 21\ncontinued indefinitely, and she was finally sent to a retreat under thr\nAct I regret to say that I have had no information about her\nduring the past few years.\nCase VIII.\u2014Mrs. E. was an excellent cook, but she had lost\nsituation after situation owing to her drunken habits.\nWhen I first heard of her, some former friends, who believed in the\nsincerity of her remorse, and trusted her'promises of amendment, having\nfound a place for her with a lady who knew her history, collected a\nsmall sum of money, part of which they expended in the purchase of\nsome respectable clothes, which they gave her, with the balance of the\nmoney, some three or four days before the time when she was to enter\nupon her new duties. Needless to say that she had sold the clothes ami\nspent the money and was hopelessly drunk when the day arrived. I\nfound her in a state of great destitution, in a miserable lodging with her\nhalf starved child, and for about three weeks supplied them with the\nbare necessaries of life, while I hypnotised her diligently. She was\nvery susceptible, and soon found, to her surprise, that she was unable to\ntake her share in a bottle of gin, which ,some boon companion had\noffered her. She rapidly regained respectability of manner and appear\nance, and in the course of about three weeks found herself a situation\nas cook, while her little daughter was admitted to an orphanage.\nFrom that time to this\u2014now nearly five years\u2014she has maintained her\ncharacter as a most respectable servant, and was so highly valued by her\nemployers that they kept the place open for her when she was obliged\nto go into hospital to be treated for a varicose ulcer of the leg.\nAn interesting point about the case is that the effect of the\nsuggestion has gradually worn off, and she is now able to take a glass\nof beer at dinner, but as yet she has suffered from no temptation to\ndrink in excess.\nAlthough it would be rash to base any conclusions upon the results\nof so very meagre a series of cases, they serve perhaps to indicate that\nthere is a possibility that this mode of treatment may be successful, or\nthat, at any rate, until hypnotism has been tried, no case of dipsomania\nshould be pronounced hopeless. Doubtless in more experienced hands\nbetter results might have been obtained, and, had we any certain means\nof ensuring a susceptibility to hypnotism, there is no reason that it\nshould not be much more uniformly successful. I have noticed in more\nthan one case that the best time to make an attempt is very shortly\nafter a bout of drunkenness, and that the patient is less easily hypnotised\nthe longer he is kept sober. Possibly, therefore, it may be discovered\nthat some drug may have the effect of increasing susceptibility, but the\nfew experiments which I have had an opportunity of making in this\ndirection have hitherto yielded barren results. Such experiments, how\never, might well repay the trouble they entail, for could we but discover\n\f22 Mr. G. Theodore Green.\na certain and reliable method of dealing with dipsomania, it would be\ndifficult to exaggerate its beneficent results, not only in the present by-\nlightening the heavy burden of human misery, but in the future by-\npromoting the health and happiness of unborn generations.\n[The following case, sent to us by Mr. C. Theodore Green,\nM.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (London), of Birkenhead, will be read with\ninterest in connection with the above.\u2014Editor.]\nThe Treatment by Suggestion, with Cure in Four Sittings, of a\nMan Addicted to the Abuse of Alcohol, Bromides, and Choral.\nOn October 6th, 1893, a man, aged 32, came tome complaining that\nfor two months past he had been unable to get a night's rest without\nbromides and chloral ; and also that he had an irresistible craving for\nwhiskey ; and that his brain was not able for his work,\u2014that of cashier\nin a very large wholesale business. His account of himself was in\ncoherent and vague, and he presented the restless appearance and\nexcited manner of a person very near dementia. He was of fair com\nplexion and hair, 5 feet 10 inches in height, in good physical condition\nof body, and having a cerebral development decidedly above the\naverage. I gathered from his conversation that in 1887 he had a\nserious bout of drinking, from which he recovered.\nSome few months ago he began to be worried about his work, and\nthen commenced taking a single glass of whiskey or beer in the even\ning. He soon found that one glass was not enough, so he had two ; in\nthis manner increasing his daily dose of stimulant, till the craving for\nit was present all the time. He consulted some doctor, who told him\nto \"go to Llandudno and drink lots of stout.\" Well, he went to\nLlandudno and drank several bottles of stout daily. But as he was\nnothing bettered, but rather grew worse, from the development of\ninsomnia, he consulted another medical man, who gave him a prescrip\ntion for \"bromides and chloral.\" Without the nightly use of this\nsedative draught, he got very little sleep, and, of course, his brain\nbecame more and more unfitted for the accurate work required of him.\nHe told me he had never been hypnotised before. As he expressed\ndisgust for his unconquerable craving, and a belief that he could be in\nfluenced by hypnotism, I agreed to try what it could do for him. I\ninsisted that this form of treatment would give him back his normal\nstrength of will, so that he would be able to conquer his unnatural\ncravings. In fact, I made him understand that it was not \/ who was\ncuring him, but that I was merely shewing him how to cure himself by\nthe exercise of his will. So, throughout the four sittings that I gave\n\fCase of Cure by Suggestion. 23\nhim, I suggested that his will was growing stronger, and that all hi*\nfunctions were coming more and more under his own control. I also\nridiculed the idea that the person hypnotised need give up or lose all\nhis will power to that of the operator.\nOn October 6th, he fell into a hypnotic slumber in seven minutes by\ngazing at. a diamond. I then made suggestions that he would sleep\nwell, and not awake at 2 a.m. as usual, that alcohol in all forms would\ntaste vile, and if swallowed would be vomited. The next day he\ntelephoned saying that he had slept right on to breakfast time\u2014the\nbest sleep he had had for two months ; and that he had had a glass of\nwhiskey, but had difficulty in keeping it down.\nHe now went away into North Wales with some friends, and I did\nnot see him for a fortnight. Shortly before he returned he wrote me\na long and very rambling letter, that made me fear still more for his\nsanity. He said that he slept very well for four or five nights after\nbeing hypnotised, but that since then he had been getting worse in\nevery way. I advised his speedy return.\nSo, on October 22nd, I hypnotised him again. This time the sleep\nwas more profound, and he seemed unable to answer my questions till\nI suggested that he could do so quite easily. I repeated the former\nsuggestions, and made use of ordinary mesmeric \" passes,\" which I\nregard as a most useful form of suggestion.\nOn October 24th, hypnosis was produced by my gazing into his eyes\nfor two minutes. On this occasion he seemed rather less excitable. He\nsaid he had been sleeping well except for a bilious attack that occurred\nduring the night of the 22nd. He also said that he had taken no more\nsedative draughts, and that he had very little desire for alcohol.\nOn October 28th, he said he slept quite well each night, and had no\ndesire either for alcohol or sedatives, and that his brain was clear. As\na test of the latter, he procured one of his cash books on the 27th, and\nworked at it for two hours, and was delighted to find that he could\nwork as well as ever. His manner is totally changed. He is restful,\nand acts and speaks as a man should when in perfect possession of his\nfaculties. I now hypnotised him for the last time, and repeated the\nformer suggestions.\nAlso I found I could inhibit all the special senses. I also gave him\na crystal, and bade him see a picture of his dining-room, which I had\nnot seen. He described it, and the persons he saw moving about in it.\nBut I was unable to make him see the picture of a room he had never\nseen, but of which I was thinking intently at the time.\nUp to date (March, 1894) there has been no relapse. Time only\ncan shew whether this cure be permanent ; but I think I am safe in\nassuming that any recurrence of the above symptoms will be as easily\nabolished by hypnotism as they were before.\n\f24 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nIII.\nTHE EXPERIENCES OF W. STAINTON MOSES.\u2014IL\nBy Frederic W. H. Myers.\nIn a former article on the experiences of Mr. Stainton Moses,\nwhich appeared in Part XXV., Vol. IX. of these Proceedings, two\nmain lines were pursued. In the first place I offered a general\nsummary of Mr. Moses' life and character, and of the nature of the\nevidence under review, with a discussion as to the trustworthiness or\notherwise of the printed and written matter which we have to treat.\nIn the second place, I gave extracts from contemporary records, by\nhimself and others, of the physical phenomena obtained during his\nfirst year of investigation, 1873-4 ; including incidentally many points\nbearing on identity of the communicating intelligences. Many subjects\nstill remain for discussion ; and it will be convenient to indicate at\nonce the order in which they will here be taken.\nA.\u2014In the first place some further extracts will be given from the\nnotes of the remaining seances (1874-1880), of which any record\nhas been kept. In Mr. Moses' own note-books this record, though\nbecoming irregular as he got tired of recording so often very similar\nphenomena, is continued till August, 1875. Mrs. Speer's notes\ncontinue at intervals until 1880, and there are occasional notes by Dr.\nSpeer during these later years. Two other occasional members of the\ncircle, Miss Birkett (now deceased) and Mrs. Garratt (known to me),\nalso took some notes, which Mrs. Garratt has kindly sent to me. I find\nthem fully concordant with the other series ; and I have printed some\nof Miss Birkett's, where points of interest are introduced. On the\nwhole, however, I have given but brief notices of these later seances.\nMr. Charlton Speer had already summarized their main features, in\nhis letter quoted in my former paper ; and no doubt can now be felt\nthat the impression of what occurred at these meetings was sub\nstantially the same in the minds of all the persons present. Nor shall\nI return to the question as to the genuinely supernormal character\nof the phenomena, which has been sufficiently discussed in my former\npaper.\nThat they were not produced fraudulently by Dr. Speer or other\nsitters I regard as proved both by moral considerations and by the fact\nthat they are constantly reported as occurring when Mr. Moses was\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 25\nalone. That Mr. Moses should have himself fraudulently produced\nthem I regard as both morally and physically incredible. That he\nshould have prepared and produced them in a state of trance I regard\nboth as physically incredible and also as entirely inconsistent with the\ntenor both of his own reports and of those of his friends. I therefore\nregard the reported phenomena as having actually occurred in a\ngenuinely supernormal manner.\nWhat is still needed, I believe, in order to produce a like conviction\nin scientific minds in general, is not so much any further argument as\nto Mr. Moses, as the occurrence of like incidents afresh in the presence\nof other mediums. Readers of the S.P.R. Journal are aware that a\ngroup of observers have been investigating the phenomena which occur\nin the presence of Eusapia Paladino\u2014phenomena which appear to\nresemble those of Mr. Moses in many points ;\u2014and we hope before long\nto publish a full statement of Eusapia's case in these Proceedings.\nShould her phenomena find acceptance, the independent corroboration\nthus furnished to Mr. Moses' case will be very important.\nB.\u2014Next to the description of Mr. Moses' physical phenomena\nmust come the quite equally important task of analysing the automatic\nwriting, of which, as already stated, 24 books remain. The contents\nof these books consist partly of messages tending to prove the identity\nof communicating spirits ; partly of discussions or explanations of the\nphysical phenomena ; and partly of religious and moral disquisition.\nAfter describing, in Mr. Moses' own words, the general method and\ncharacter of this writing, it will be well to consider those passages\nwhich bear upon the identity of the communicating intelligences.\nC.\u2014These may be fitly introduced by a paper entitled \" The\nIdentity of Spirit,\" composed by Mr. Moses in his last years, but not\npublished by him. In this paper about thirty spirits are specified, and,\ntaking these first, I shall add to Mr. Moses' own account such further\ncorroborative particulars as collation of other passages in his writings,\nor independent enquiry, may have supplied.\nD.\u2014I shall next deal with certain other communicating spirits\nwhose messages appear to carry evidence of identity ; representing\nmainly persons lately deceased, and desirous of communicating for\nprivate reasons.\nE.\u2014Having thus briefly described the alleged communicating\nintelligences, I shall hope in a future paper to arrange and summarise\nwhat they have to say as to the accompanying phenomena. This task\nis not easy ; since these so-called explanations, although, as I hope to\nshow, really consistent and conceivable, are given in a scattered and\nunscientific form ; while they cannot, of course, be regarded as in\nthemselves authoritative. There is, however, much interesting\n\f26 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nmatter of Mr. Moses' own, touching his own subjective impressions\nand phenomena occurring to him in solitude, which will best be given\nin that connection.\nF.\u2014There will still remain a task which, in Mr. Moses' own eyes,\nwas the most important in the whole field. The main object of the\nmanifestations, as was again and again asserted by his \" guides,\" was\na moral and religious one. Certain teaching of high importance was\nto be given ; and the marvels were to be regarded merely as a method\nof ensuring that due attention should be paid to a message which\ncame with such credentials. Many of these ethical communications\nhave been printed in Spirit Teachings, and I do not propose to\nreproduce them. Others may perhaps hereafter be printed in a\nsecond volume of Spirit Teachings. For myself, at some future time it\nmay be well to give briefly the gist or spirit of these communications,\ncomparing them with such deductions as may fairly be made from the\nprinciple of telepathy,\u2014 our main guide, at present, in any speculations\nof this type.\nI now take up the series of Mr. Moses' notes about November 1873,\nwhere my former quotations ceased.\nExtracts from Mr. Moses' Note-Books.\nDecember 5th.\u2014Douglas House. Mr. Percival, Dr. and Mrs. Speer,\nand myself.\u2014A wonderful demonstration of knocks, at least four\ndistinct knocks occurring simultaneously, and keeping on for some\nminutes. Little Pauline came and knocked close by Dr. Speer ; with\nher was a clear drumming on the table, a dull sound apparently\nmade on the cloth which covered the table, and a loud, clear\nknocking on the lower part of the table. At the same time a con\ntinuous sound was being made on the floor near my chair, and a\ncreaking on the chair itself. These sounds continued ceaselessly for a\nconsiderable time\u2014I should say nearly half-an-hour, at any rate for\nmore than fifteen minutes. It was a most singular noise that the\ncombined knockings made. The room seemed to be full of intelligences\nmanifesting their presence. In the midst of it came Grocyn with his\nmusical sound ; the same as ever, but feebler. He did not play much.\nCopious scent fell from the ceiling, accompanied by a sort of whistle,\nwhich we have noticed before in connexion with this manifestation.\nImperator controlled, and spoke at length on religious questions. In\nanswer to questions from Mr. P., he affirmed the doctrine of re-incar\nnation, although carefully guarding his opinion. He answered a\nquestion a3 to the time when a soul took possession of the body by\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 27\nsaying that there were cases in which the soul had lived before. I am\nnot able to record what took place exactly, but the doctrine was\naffirmed. I wait to question more clearly through writing.\nDecember %th.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self alone.\u2014Raps and slight\nsound of Grocyn gave place to a control by Imperator, who modified a\ngood deal what had been supposed to have been said on the previous\nevening. He explained that he had not stated the re-incarnation\ntheory save as another chance for souls who had sunk so low as\npractically to lose identity. They were incarnated again, and so had\nmeans of progress. He stated that the control had been bad, and\nthat much that had been said was not reliable. The control gave\nplace to one by the Bishop [Wilberforce], who spoke for the first time\nas regards his identity. His voice was as different as possible from\nImperator's, and the effect was very startling. The control lasted far\nbeyond the breaking up of the seance. I was clairvoyant, and saw the\nBishop, Catharine, and Grocyn. At Imperator's request Grocyn made\nsome of the most beautiful sounds he has yet made. Catharine also\nknocked near Dr. Speer. I complained of cold and of a sensation\nof darkness after seeing so much light. The control was so perfect\nthat I did not shake it off altogether until I had slept, which I did\nheavily all through the night.\nDecember 18th.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and self alone\nin the study.\u2014Raps commenced almost at once, a strong contrast\nto the weary waiting at Mr. Crookes's. The power was evidently\nstrong. We had had raps and scent whilst sitting at dinner, and as\nsoon as we sat down both recommenced. My chair was drawn back,\nand Grocyn played over and about the circle, finally coming on the\ntable. His sound commenced behind me, near the door, and at Dr. Speer's\nrequest he went off into the air and made the tambourine sound over\nthe table. It was very pronounced. We spoke of the persistence\nof Grocyn's manifestations, and Dr. S. contrasted them with those of\nJohn Dee, who had not manifested for months. Instantly a loud crash\ncame on the table and John Dee manifested freely. It seemed as\nthough he were waiting till the direction of our minds to him enabled\nhim to manifest. It gave one an idea of a telegraph wire disconnected\nfor a time, the connexion being supplied by our thoughts. Seneca\nwas asked for, and replied at once with the peculiar dropping sound,\nwith harmonium stool and table. The room was full of light, and\nGrocyn wrote in his own writing on a piece of marked paper put under\nthe table. It was just like his writing through my hand. \" I am\nhere.\u2014W. Grocyn.\"\nI have omitted to say that the table was moved and put\nstraight. We had altered its position at starting. Grocyn seemed\n\f28 The Experiences of W.

Dr. and Mrs. Speer,\nand self.\u2014The house was fresh, and the manifestations were irregular,\nas is frequently the case. The old house next door, in which we sat\nwhen I was last at Shanklin, had got seasoned. This was new. We\nhad a great variety of raps. A spirit who used to come with a\nwhirring sound manifested, again, but with a grinding sound, somewhat\nsimilar, but without the whirr. He said (W. H. S.) that he came from\nKensal, came down with me. He wished for prayer. John Dee\nmanifested. Grocyn very sweetly.2\nJanuary let, 1874.\u2014Shanklin. Dr. and Mrs. S., and self.\u2014Stormy,\nblowing a gale, and raining in the evening. Day extremely fine and\nbright. Many sounds. W. H. S.'s peculiar sound again. Grocyn\nslightly. Catharine. Dr. S. asked her to go near him, and she said she\ncould not. Conditions were bad, and she could not go far from the\nmedium. This is frequently said. A curious little plucking sound in\nmid-air, near Mrs. Speer apparently. A name spelled out, \"Cecilia\nFeilden,\" an old friend of Mrs. Speer, whose grave Dr. S. and\nI had visited at Bonchurch in the morning. She said she had\nheard of Dr. Eves's death from Miss Kirkland [also deceased].\nShe remained some time conversing, during which I kept my mind\nfixed hard on Virgil, repeating portions of it and disengaging my mind\nfrom what was going on. She said that \"many spirits from long\nbeyond had come with her.\" She rapped out finally, \" I must depart.\nAdieu,\" and immediately the sounds ceased. On taking up a marked\nsheet of paper which we had put down it was found to be written on,\n\" C.

At\nGarrison the din in my bed-room followed a visit to an old disused\nburying-ground ; and now after a visit to Bonchurch this came. The\nspirit was in earth-life a friend of Mrs. Speer's. She had seen her mother\nand two sisters. Asked if any friend was lying near her at Bonchurch,\nshe rapped out, \"Sir Robert Arbuthnot'-' [no mention of verification,\n1 December 18th.\u2014S\u00e9ance in my study.

I did not expect her at all.\n'We broke and resumed, and while hands were held, after much convul\nsion on my part, H 's and Rector's names were written on marked\npaper under the table. Dr. S. had asked for H 's signature. When\nI went to bed the noise in my room was very great. It seemed as\nthough two persons were quarrelling with each other in opposite\ncorners of the room. The noise was very great, heavy poundings\nbeing made at the same time on the floor and walls, and the l<edclothea\nplucked. The noise continued all night long ; and was mast pro\nnounced in the dead of the night (1 to 4 a.m.). I have frequently\nnoticed the power then seems most in force.\n'We had cool waves of scented air during the evening. Manifes\ntations did not occur so readily as usual, nor were they so powerful.1\nJanuary 2nd.\u2014Same circle and place.\u2014W. H. S. came again with\na slight grinding sound.

A letter has been sent to the vicar to\nverify the fact. [Facts ultimately verified by Mr. Spratley's son.\nThe case will be referred to later.

She communicated most satis\nfactorily in every way, to our great surprise, as this rarely is the case upon\ntheirfirst visit to a mundane circle.

He did so, with the same knock. Mentor returned for a\nminute, controlled me without effort, and said that he had been allowed\nto come back for a while. He said he would try and come back one\nevening and show lights for us. He afterwards threw some musk in\npowder on the table near Mrs. Speer. The table, a large loo table, was\ntilted until it rested on the ground near Dr. Speer. He asked that it\nmight rest on his finger, and it did so, beating quite gently. Yet the\nnormal weight of the table was sufficient to have hurt him badly. I\nwas far away from the table and could not touch it. Yet it was\nreplaced in its original position quite gently. Mentor again controlled\nfor a moment, and said that they had written for my friend on the\npaper under the table. Two pieces had been marked and put down,\none near me and the other close to Dr. Speer, separated from me by the\nwhole width of the table, six feet ; on that was written \" T. S. A.\"\nand \" Rector.\" Dr. S. had requested that writing might be done near\nhim. Grocyn came and said good-night on his lyre, and the seance\nconcluded.\nJanuary 3rd, 1874.\u2014Same circle and place.\u2014W. H. S. came with\nhis grinding sounds. Grocyn played very sweetly, and the heavy\ndropping sound said to be made by Seneca was repeated several times.\nWe enquired who made the little rolling or dropping sounds on the\ntable, and were informed that two spirits whom Rector had brought,\nI and P , made them. I referred after to my books and\nfound that the promise had been given on May 10th, 1873. Rector\nmanifested, and we had great quantities of scent\u2014verbena especially.\nThe odour was very strong indeed. After a ten minutes' break,\nMentor controlled and made some wonderful lights, or rather one\npersistent light, which remained clear and visible for more than forty\nminutes. I am sorry that I cannot record accurately the time, but\nwe entered the room shortly after 10 p.m., and the seance broke up at\n11.30. The light appeared, say, ten minutes after we sat down, and\nlasted till about the same time before we broke up. I therefore\nallowed a wide margin when I said it lasted without going out for\nforty minutes. It commenced in the corner of the room behind me.\nDr. S. noticed one as soon as we sat down, which faded at once. Then\nDr. and Mrs. S. saw another, which also faded out. The control (as\nthey tell me) by Mentor was at once established, and I was in a deep\ntrance for the remainder of the sitting. A light at once appeared near\nmy left hand, on or just over the table. It is described as a cylinder\nof luminous substance, hard, and giving a golden light. It would be\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. SI\nabout four inches by three inches, and apparently circular at top and\nbottom. It was draped with something that Dr. 8peer felt, and said\nwas coarse and rough. From the time it appeared it never once\nfaded from view. It grew at times stronger, and was faint at first,\ngradually acquiring brilliancy and clearness. It moved round the\ncircle, touched all, beat on the table just as J. King's does, struck\nthe chandelier over our heads, hit the ceiling, and sailed slowly into\nthe far corner of the room, some yards from us. Its movements were\nslow and stately, and the light golden and very steady. No waves\nof light, apparently, but just a solid, self-luminous cake. The colour\nwas not that of phosphorescent light, but yellower and more golden.\nMentor spoke very freely, and said he could have kept it alive for\nlonger, but was afraid of hurting me. The light, he said, was fed from\nmy body. The next morning I felt very cold, tired, and weak, with\npain in the spine, especially at the lower part, and over the solar\nplexus.1\nI January 3rd.\u2014Seance.\u2014The peculiar grinding sound was soon hoard.\nGrocyn then manifested ; other hitherto unknown sounds were also heard.\nThe sound as of a stone dropping on the table, and then on to the ground ,\nwas heard. A spirit came and gave his name as Henry Spratley, Moor\nCottage, Maidenhead. He said that he had been sent by Imperator to give\nproofs of his identity, and he gave his age and date of his death. No one\nin the circle had ever been to Maidenhead, or had ever seen or heard the\nname before. So on the following morning I wrote on spec, to the vicar for\ninformation (owing to absence, I may say, his answer did not reach us for a\nmonth). No answer. Mr. M. wrote to the postmaster, but he received no\nanswer. Mrs. Speer then wrote : \" To the occupant of Moor Cottage,\" and\nwas at once answered by the son, Henry Spratley, who corroborated every\nparticular given by the spirit. Another deceased (eight months) friend of\none of the circle then came and gave much information hitherto unknown to\nany of us, and all of which wassubsequently verified. On closing the seance\nthe initials of the deceased friend, T. S. A., and Rector were found written\nupon the paper always placed under the table. At this seance, and at the\npreceding one, large quantities of liquid scent\u2014verbena and musk\u2014(the\nlatter in powder) were freely showered down upon us. On breaking for a\nfew minutes and then resuming the seance, Mentor came and exhibited a\nmost remarkable light, of cylindrical shape, and covered with drapery. It\nmoved about freely in all directions, always returning and resting upon the\nedge of the table, and then advancing to its centre. It then would sail away\nto different parts of the room, striking the gaseliers in its ascent, and then\n(by request) striking the ceiling as far distant from the circle as it was\npossible to do so. By request again it placed itself, surrounded by its\ndrapery, in my outstretched palm. I could distinctly pinch the drapery. It\nremained visible for upwards of forty minutes, and was a hitherto unex\nampled manifestation.\u2014S.T.S.

Great\nmasses of floating light filled the room, visible to Dr. S., though he\nusually does not see the light. A tap came under Mrs. Speer's hands,\nand the name \" George Eves \" was rapped out. He said he was her\nbrother, had manifested at the Holmeses', and through me at Mrs.\nGregory's. Another sound followed, and \"Augustus Eves \" rapped out\nhis name, affirmed his identity, and said he had manifested at the\nHolmeses'. He said Imperator had allowed him to come. Asked who\nImperator was, he said, \"Prophet of the coming Truth\"\u2014an expression\ncharacteristic of him, Mrs. Speer says. Asked further for the name,\nno response was given. Other raps then came, and \" Emma \" was\nrapped out\u2014Mrs. Speer's sister. She gave her assurance, and the raps\nthen changed to Mrs. Speer's father's. \" God protect and guard you,\ndear Marie.\" Then Mrs. S.'s brother came back : \"We have been\nallowed to return, and give proof to convince. Imperator allowed\nus.\" Grocyn struck up a lively note, called for alphabet, and spelt out\nby his sounds, \" Cease, and be thankful. Great and wise spirits have\nmade effort to convince you.\" 1\nAll the evidence now is on the identity question.

Same conditions.\u2014Masses of floating\namorphous light were almost at once seen, and an object brought through\nthe locked doors from our bed-room above.

Stainton Moses. 33\nDr. S. had not heard me, and he felt the weight on his finger rather\nseverely. At request the table was very gently levitated to the\nheight of more than a foot from the floor. It settled down quite\ncalmly.\nAll this time I had seen a veiled figure standing by Dr. 8. Mrs.\nS. could see the light, but could not distinguish the figure. It did not\nseem to move, and was apparently outside the circle, near the\nwindow curtains. It did not move. Presently distinctive raps came\non the table, and \" Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, I salute you,\"\nwas rapped out. Dr. S. questioned the spirit in French, and answer*\nwere returned correctly. A curious instance of this was as follows :\nDr. S. intended to ask the name of Napoleon's mother, but by mistake\nasked for the wife's name. This was given, a response not to the\nmental intent, but to the spoken question. After some other unimpor\ntant questions, I asked for something unknown to any of us, and the\ndate of his birth, April 20th, 1808, was given. This we have verified\nand found correct. Dr. S. asked for some direct writing on one of the\ntwo marked papers, and assent was given, \"J'ecrirai. Taisez-vous.\"\nMentor controlled, and said that it was really the spirit of Napoleon,\nlate Emperor of the French. They would write on the paper near\nDr. Speer's foot, that being nearest to where the figure had been\nstanding. After his control passed I was, as is frequently the case,\nclairvoyant, and described the face of the Emperor, his waxed imperial\nand moustache, his impassive marble face, and wound up by saying ho\nwas a \" regular Mephistopheles.\" The form was just in the same place,\nand apparently could not come within the circle. Mentor was at my\nright hand, and rapped clearly at request with his double knock. All\nthis time our hands were joined, and remained so until the seance\nclosed, and we found on the paper close by Dr. Speer's foot writing of\nwhich I append afacsimile.\nThis is a good case of evidence from four sources :\u2014\n1. Clairvoyant Vision.\n2. Raps through table.\n3. Confirmation by Mentor.\n4. Direct Writing.\nI have omitted to say that tbe spirit, being asked why he came,\np\n\f34 The Experiences of W.

The usual features which mark every sitting\nwill not be recorded at length. The point to-night was the levitation\nof the table. It darted up several times into the air to the height of\ntwo feet or more. The movement was sudden, and it settled down\nagain quite gently. I was raised in my chair from the ground twice.\nThe chair was an inch or two only from the ground. A chair behind\nme was lifted and placed on my chair, leaning from it to the wall.\nSunday, January 18<A, 1874.\u2014A long communication from Im\nperator, detailing changes in the band of communicating spirits. In\nthe evening we sat at Douglas House. A large piece of coral was\nplaced very gently on the table. We did not discover it until Mrs. S.\naccidentally touched it. It is the largest object we have had brought\nin. It came from the hall outside. Two books from the bookcase\nnear were put on the table, and a small ivory tablet of Dr. Speer's\nfrom the same place, but near to him. It was thrown gently, so as to\nfall near Mrs. Speer. We were discussing this attempt to bring objects\nin a different direction during a break in the sitting. As soon as the\ngas was put out, a book from a closed cupboard at the corner farthest\nfrom me, and immediately behind Dr. Speer, was brought out and\nstruck him on the shoulder, and fell near Mrs. S. This is the first\nattempt that has been made to bring an object from behind a sitter\nopposite to me. Usually the power seems to be behind me. The waves\nof scent are detected by both sitters before I smell them. The objects\ncome over my head when brought into the room, and movements of\narticles occur behind and near me. Grocyn plays behind and near me\nusually, though at times he goes far away. But in this case the book\ncame from a closed cupboard behind Dr. Speer, struck him on the\n1January 5th.\u2014S\u00e9ance.\u2014Raps and scent almost immediately. A figure was\nthen seen by one of the circle standing aside of me. The heavy table moved\nand tilted. Alphabet was called for, and Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte\nwas rapped out. (No one in the circle knew that his name was Charles.) I\nasked him a variety of questions, of which we were ignorant, with a view to\ntest, and they were all subsequently ascertained to be true. I asked why he\ncame. \" Invited,\" he said, \" by Imperator.\" Mark the imperial tone\u2014not\n\"ordered,\" but \"invited.\" After replying to our questions, I asked if he\ncould write for us. He gave \" J'^crirai,\" and then rapped out \" Taisez-vous,\"\ni.e., silence. The ex-Emperor now became distinctly visible to the clair\nvoyant member of the circle, and presented a sad and dejected expression of\ncountenance. At the close of the seance the paper under the table had\nbeen written upon, and the C. L. N. B. stood out in a fine, bold, flowing\nhand.\u2014S.T.S.\n\fThe Experiences of W.

He had intended to ask for some\nthing to be brought from near him, as he had formed an idea that the\nforce was connected with the spine of the medium. His wish was\nanticipated. We had abundance of scent-laden air, the coldest I ever\nfelt. A sensitive thermometer would have gone down several degrees.\n[See on February 7th.] I never felt such cold air. The Prophet\nshowed his little light. It was very brilliant, and at times like two\nbright buttons with a dark space between them. It evidently had\na dark back to it. Most generally it was invisible to me, though I\nwas not entranced. The table was levitated several times, as on the\nprevious night. My chair was drawn away from it.\nJanuary 21*<.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014I had\nbeen very unwell. The physical movements were all quiet. The only\nimportant thing was the rapping out the name \" Alexander Thelliffsen,\"\nan old parishioner of mine at Douglas, whose deathbed I had attended.\nHe gave some slight particulars. I had forgotten his name, and do not\nnow know his Christian name.\nJanuary 24<A.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and Mr. Percival.\n\u2014We sat in the dining-room. The most marked manifestation was cold,\nscent-laden air, which we had in great quantities. H. Spratley came\nand rapped out, \" It is true that I said.\" We have received confirma\ntion from his son. Divers raps, and then Imperator controlled and\nspoke of God and other subjects. He also answered questions as to\nmaterialisation. The Prophet showed his little light, and when I\nsneezed Dr. S. saw a light flash up suddenly on the other side (right) ;\nit was a simple flash, dying out at once. At night, when I put out the\nlight, I noticed my hands luminous. I am still unwell.\u2014The evening\nwas clear and fine, and the barometer high.\nJanuary 2oth.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014The\nwhole seance was occupied by a series of messages from Thomas Wilson,\nBishop of Sodor and Man, who has lately written in my book. He\ngave the most minute details. He was born at Burton, in Cheshire,\nDecember 20th, 1663 ; died March 7th, 1755, aged 91. Mother's name,\nSherlock, born at Oxton, in Cheshire ; schoolmaster, Mr Harper, of\nChester : ordained by Dr. Morton, Bishop of Kildare, to curacy of his\nuncle, Dr. Sherlock. He was made Bishop of Sodor and Man in 1697,\nand married Mary Patten, of Warrington, 1698. He had four\nchildren : Mary, died aged thirteen ; Thomas, aged one year ; Alice,\naged two ; and Thomas, who survived him. All this was rapped out\nin answer to questions without a particle of hesitation, and with clear\nness and precision. He said he was in the fourth sphere, went to the\nIsle of Man occasionally, but knew nothing of the present Bishop.\nHad been sent by Imperator, knew the Prophet, and gave his name,\nbut declined to give the name of the third \"Vatea\" until Imperator\n\f36 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\ngave it. He also gave Imperator's name. The light was very strong\nin the room, and we had one shower of scent. This is the most curious\ndescriptive account we have had through the table, though many such\nhave been written out in my book. The Bishop said that the writing\nin my book was in his own hand. I have sent for a letter of his, if one\ncan be had, and I propose to verify all the above details, if possible.\n[Note added later : The handwriting is a facsimile. I obtained a\nletter from the Isle of Man.]\nFebruary 1st.\u2014I have succeeded in verifying all the above particu\nlars. I can find no record of the death of his infant children.\n[I have verified these facts, except names and age at death of two\nchildren, from Stowell's Life of Wilson, published 1819. This easily\naccessible work contains no specimen of handwriting. Mr Moses\nshowed me, in 1886, the letter in Bishop Wilson's handwriting, which\nmuch resembled that of the automatic script. It is noticeable\nthat, in this case and Grocyn's, details as to historic personages, such\nas are usually written automatically, are flashed or rapped out at\nseances.\u2014F.W.H. M.]\nOn Sunday Morning (January 25th, 1874) I had another of the\ncurious visions which I have experienced twice before. I was sitting\nat my table in Clifton-road\u2014time, 1 p.m. or thereabouts. I had break\nfasted late, about 10.30, and had been writing since breakfast. I am\nunable to say how long the vision lasted, nor am I able to fix exactly\nthe time of its commencement. If I may judge by the amount I had\nwritten, it could not be long. I have no remembrance of ceasing to\nwrite. The first thing that I remember was standing beside my body\nand looking at it. I did not feel surprised, but only curious to know\nhow I got there. The spirit body seemed to be disengaged and to be\nleading an independent existence. While I was looking I was con\nscious of the presence of the Prophet, who stood beside me. He was\nrobed in sapphire blue, and on his head was a coronet with a very\nbright star in the middle over the brow. The face was what I have\nseen before\u2014the face of an old man with a long beard and moustache,\ndeep-set eyes and large massive brow. He explained to me that I was\nout of the body, and told me to follow him. I remember well the\noddity of my sensation when I discovered that the wall of the room\nwas no bar to me. We passed on our way without obstacle until I\nfound that we were in the midst of a very beautiful landscape. How\nwe got there I do not know, but I seemed to have changed almost\ninstantaneously the surroundings of earth for the scenery of the\nspheres. A special effort, I imagine, of my guide enabled me to see\nmy body, and after that I resumed spirit vision to the exclusion of\nbodily vision. The scenery through which I passed was like an earthly\nlandscape, but the air was more translucent, the water more clear and\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 37\nsparkling, the trees greener and more luxuriant. I went along with\nout conversation, and noted the ease with which my will carried me\nalong with a peculiar gliding motion. At the end of my journey we\ncame to a simple cottage, very like many I have seen here, and there\nI found my Grandmother Stainton. She was just as I remembered her,\nonly clothed in a long pure robe, with a girdle of deep red. Her hair\nwas bound with a simple fillet, and her whole face and figure were\nidealised and glorified. She attempted to address me, but my guide\nmotioned me away and hurried me back. From this point my memory\ngrows fainter and fainter, and I can recall no more until I found myself\nsitting in my chair, the pen on the table by my side, and the paper on\nwhich I had been writing before me. The ink was very dry, and I was\nfor a time only partly conscious of what I had seen. It all came back\nby degrees. Now at night it is conceivable that I might be drowsy\nor sleepy, though I know I was not on the occasion of the previous\nvision. But this was midday. I certainly did not go to sleep. I had\nhad breakfast and nothing else two hours ago, and the vision was\na propos of nothing that was in my thoughts. It is stated by communi\ncating spirits that the occurrence was real, and that my oblivion of the\nlatter part was caused by the necessity of hurrying me back, as the\nconditions were not good.1\nJanuary 26<A.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S.\u2014A great variety\nof raps of different kinds\u2014one quite new, a sort of roll like a drum of\na very peculiar kind. Dr. S. tried in vain to imitate it. We were\ntold that it was made by Theophilus. Grocyn came and played, but not\nvery well. The Prophet showed his light at request. The heavy,\ndropping sound came, too, at Dr. Speer's request. The little dropping\nsounds on the table were plain. A peculiar reflected light in the\npolished mahogany of the bookcase came two or three times. It was\nabout the size of a hen's egg, and appeared reflected\u2014from what source\nI could not discover. My chair was drawn away from the table, and\nImperator delivered a long address.\nOn coming out of the trance, I saw and described the spirit as one\nof commanding mien, with a short robe girt round the waist, and a\ncrown with a cross t^t in the centre, just as the Prophet has a star. In\nhis hand he held a long wand, terminating in a cross. He said nothing,\nand gradually faded from view.\nJanuary 29th, 1874.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S.\u2014As soon\nas we sat down we had cool air and scent. Grocyn played, and at\nrequest made the deep violoncello sound.

The heavy dropping sound was\nmade on the harmonium stool at Dr. Speer's request. Little Dicky\ncame back with his old creak, and controlled me in the oddest, squeaky\nlittle voice. It is described as very peculiar. A. W. also came back\nand gave her name. Just as before, her raps were tiny and delicate.\nI was clairvoyant, and described my grandmother again. She had a\nchild with her. I also described the Prophet and Theophilus, and\nseveral spirits who were apparently at the ceiling over the table, and\nwere showering down scent. As the s\u00e9ance was about to break up, I\nsaw a spirit suddenly come, and immediately John Dee's crack was\nheard. At request he moderated it, and made it on the harmonium\nstool and table.\nSaturday, February 7th, 1874.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. Speer, Mr. Percival,\nMr. H., and self.\u2014Floating masses of light. Beautiful scent, like\nhoneysuckle. It was like the air in a country lane. Grocyn played\nvery loudly, imitating the clock, as usual. More scent. Air very cool,\nso cold, in short, that it made all the circle shiver, except myself. It\ncame, as usual, from over my head A self-registering thermometer\nwhich had been put on the table showed a deflection of 6deg. after the\nseance was over. The cold was intense at times. The Prophet's little\nlight came, and we held a long conversation with him, the answers\nbeing given in flashes. It was a very pretty manifestation, the light\nbeing turned in each case to the questioner. A curious muffled whisper\ncame between me and Mrs. Speer, and Mr. H. thought it was a voice\ntrying to speak. We extemporised a tube, and some muffled\nwhispering sounds were made, but it did not come to much.\nThe tube was taken up and thrown down by Dr. Speer. A loud noise\non the table by Mr. P. was made by the fall of a round stone which\nhad been brought from the study at his back. He had just remarked\nthat he had never witnessed a clear case of the passage of matter\nthrough matter. A heavy ornament (statuette) from the mantelpiece\nbehind me was placed on my head, and then very quietly on the\nopposite side of the table. Continual scented air was blown about.\nImperator controlled, and spoke for an hour on the Nature of God. I\ndo not record what he said, as I find a good deal of it repeated in my\nbook.\nFebruary 8th, 1874.\u2014Same circle on the following night.\u2014Scent\nagain, with very cold air, which made all shiver.

The manifestations were similar to those of the preceding night.\nMr. P. seemed to be in the centre of clouds of light, and felt the influence\nvery much. At night he had manifestations in his room, the bed being\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 30\nviolently shaken. The sounds of Grocyn and the Prophet's light and\nthe scent were very successful.\nTuesday, February \\0lh, 1874.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014A\npeculiar triple sound on the table, and then the following messages\nwere rapped out :\u2014\" Bertie Henry D'Oly Jones, died at Umballa,\nIndia, December 31st, 1873, aged one year and seven months.\" This was\nelicited by repeated questions. Alphabet was again called, and\n\" D apostrophe Oly \" was spelt out. Again : \" Edward George Nigel\nJones, died January 3rd, 1874, aged two years and nine months. After\nwards we had another brother join us, January 5th, Cholmely\u2014children\nof Nigel Jones.\" Other questions elicited answers that Imperator had\nsent them. We afterwards searched the Indian Mail, but could dis\ncover no trace. At length, in looking over the Pall Mall Budyet, we\nfound the appended notice, which only gives initials :\u2014\n\" Jones.\u2014Bertie H. D'O., aged 1, Dec. 31st; Edward G.

It is not, of course, implied that the children them\nselves spelt the names thus carefully, but rather Imperator, or their\nmother, also lately deceased. Conversely there is a case where a well-\nknown name is spelt incorrectly in direct writing, and it is explained\nthat the famous spirit was using a clumsy intermediary. \" Zachary\nGray\" spelt his name \"Grey\" in all actual writings of his that\nI have seea\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nNo one of us had ever heard of the children or their parents.\nWednesday, Thursday, and Saturday, February 11th, 12lh, Wth.\u2014I\nclass these seances together, as the phenomena were somewhat similar. I\nam now staying at Douglas House, and we sit regularly.\nThe week has been marked by a remarkable development of Grocyn's\nmusic. He has made beautiful sounds within the circle, playing chords\nexquisitely, arpeggio chords at Dr. S.'s request, intervals, (fee. The\nWelsh harper played in concert with him, and made some very curious\nhigh notes. But the most remarkable sound was that of a very deep\nbass string played quite out of the circle. It sounded like a big drum,\nand was away behind me. It was the first time that we had such\ndistinct evidence of sound made away from the table. Mrs. S. remarked\nof the sound that it was as loud as J. Dee's. Immediately there came\na crash on the table close to her elbow, which startled us tremendously.\nHe was standing near, and something\u2014the mention of his name and\ndirecting of our minds to him (?)\u2014enabled him to manifest. The\nProphet showed his light and answered questions as before. Abundance\nof scent and cool air were given. Vates came with a peculiar knock,\n\f40 The Experiences of W.

I have omitted to say\nthat I described clairvoyantly the Prophet and the Seer together\u2014the\nlatter a young and very beautiful spirit, the Prophet dignified and\naged. Also Grocyn and a tall spirit by Dr. Speer whom I did not\nknow.

I had imagined it\nto be impersonal to a certain extent. The control was interfered\nwith by Dr. Speer leaving and breaking the circle.

G.'s sounds this\nevening were so deep, resembling a drum, that we remarked they were\nalmost as loud as the sounds Dr. Dee produced. Instantly he came, and\nmade a tremendous rap between me and Mr. S. M. H.'s light was then\nvisible, and answered questions as usual.\n\" February Uth.\u2014We again met in our seance-roorn, which was soon\nfilled with spirit-light, large masses floating about in every direction. G.\nquickly manifested, playing sweetly. We heard the music, very soft, outside\nthe circle ; then it sounded in the corners of the room, and came behind the\nmedium, floating over his head. The sounds were more beautiful than\nusual\u2014pure and sweet, and harp-like, the table not acting as a sounding-\nboard, as on previous occasions. Octaves, chords, and intervals were instantly\nsounded by request, as on the previous evening. The spirit known to us as\nthe Welsh Harper also answered questions on the strings of his spirit-harp.\nA fresh musical sound came, made by another spirit. Name not given. We\nheard an unknown rap on the table, soft and muffled, something like\nImperator's. On asking who it was, \" Vates\" was given through the alpha\nbet, also \"Break.\" On returning to the room many sounds were made\naround the medium. H.'s light flashed, and the medium tried to speak.\nThe voice was quite unlike Imperator's. The spirit tried to control the\nmedium three different times, but failed. Imperator then spoke, saying the\nvoice was new. Vates was trying to communicate, and as he wished it to\nhave its own peculiar identity it was more difficult . He said the spirit had\ntaken the name of \"Vates \" as they did not wish great names to be brought\nbefore the public.

Dr. and Mrs. S., Mr. Percival,\nMiss B., and self.\u2014From the first the manifestations seemed to\nsuffer from the introduction of a new element. Grocyn's sound was\nwooden and poor ; there were frequent pauses, and the only copious\nmanifestation was the shower of scent by Miss B. It has been so on\nthe two previous occasions when she has been present. There is\nevidently something in her influence which does not work harmoni\nously at present. Imperator controlled very slightly, and when the\nlight was struck for the purpose of taking notes the control passed\naway at once. It was afterwards resumed, and the old subject of\nGod was explained, and some questions answered. But the whole was\ndifficult.1\nFebruary I8lh.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014It\nwas late before we sat. The raps were very various and Grocyn's\nsounds were very good. He had a peculiar tambourine sound, which\nwas very curious and quite independent of the circle or table. The\nroom was very full of light, and the points of light were different.\nThe Prophet did not show his little bright speck, but in place of it a\nduller point of light, which flashed about and assumed at times the\nappearance as of a column of phosphorescent smoke. It was quite\ndifferent from what we had before seen. Raps on the table and on my\nchair, and quantities of scent and cold air. The scent of violets was\nvery pronounced ; also of verbena and another pure scent not unlike\neau-de-cologne.\n1 Miss Birkett describes this sitting as follows :\u2014\n\" Various scents were wafted round the room to each sitter, with strong\ncurrents of air, after which liquid verbena was poured down on Dr. S. as if\nfrom the rose of a watering-pot in a continuous stream, somo showers of\nit extending to M. B. [herself]. A long and glow-worm-like light tilted\nabout for some time near Mr. Moses.\"\n\f42 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nFebruary 19<A.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. Speer and self.\u2014No phenomena\nworth recording were shown. Grocyn played, but not well. Scent\nwas abundant, and the floating masses of light were visible to all.\nThere were three distinct musical sounds\u2014or four, I fancy : Grocyn's\nold sound, the Welsh harper, the tambourine, and a new sound,\napparently made by plucking a string. The sound made gave one the\nidea of a band tuning.\nFebruary 20<A, 1874.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. Speer and I dined with Mrs.\nGregory, to meet the Baron du Potet, the celebrated magnetist and\nspiritualist. Mr. Percival was of the party. During dinner I was\nconscious of a strange influence in the room, and mentioned the fact.\nThe Baron had previously magnetised me very strongly, and had\nrendered me more than usually clairvoyant. He also recognised a\nspirit in the room, but thought it was the spirit of a living person.\nAfter dinner, when we got upstairs, I felt an uncontrollable inclination\nto write, and I asked the Baron to lay his hand upon my arm. It\nbegan to move very soon, and I fell into a deep trance. As far\nas I can gather from the witnesses, the hand then wrote out, \" I killed\nmyself to-day.\" This was preceded by a very rude drawing, and then\n\" Under steam-roller, Baker-street, medium passed,\" [i.e. W.S.M.] was\nwritten. At the same time I spoke in the trance and rose and\napparently motioned something away, saying \" Blood \" several times.\nThis was repeated, and the spirit asked for prayer. Mrs. G. said a\nfew words of prayer, and I came out of the trance at last, feeling\nvery unwell. On the following day Dr. Speer and I walked down to\nBaker-street and asked the policeman on duty if any accident had\noccurred there. He told us that a man had been killed by the steam\nroller at 9 a.m., and that he himself had helped to carry the body to\nMarylebone Workhouse.\nI felt the influence at night very much, and did not shake it off for\nforty-eight hours. This is curious evidence of spirit action.1\nSunday, February 22nd.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014The control\nwas interfered with by the events of the previous day. Nothing could\nbe done except irregular rappings and movements of my chair.

They were as clear and palpable to the\neye as human beings would be in a strong light. Placing my hand\nover my eyes made no difference, but turning away I could see them\nno longer. This experiment I repeated several times. I also saw the\nlittle Catherine. This is the first time I remember being so clair\nvoyant in a seance without being previously entranced. \" Torquay \"\nwas rapped out ; we could not understand why.

Dr. S. suggested joining hands, and we did so. The table at\nonce began to move, and my chair was withdrawn until we were forced\nto loose hands. I was put close to the door, and sat full six feet from\nthe table. In that position raps were made on the table and it was\nmoved,\u2014the raps were loud and decisive on the table. My chair was\nviolently shaken and moved, and 1 raised myself so as to remove my\nfeet from the floor, crouching upon the seat. In that position the\nchair was moved with equal facility, and loud rappings were made on\nthe wall, door, cupboards, harmonium, and floor. The noise was very\ngreat. The Prophet showed his light very brightly, and it flashed about\nlike forked lightning. I saw the reflection in the looking-glass very\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\ndistinctly. We had plenty of very beautiful scent, and some of it\nwhich was thrown into Mrs. Speer's eye caused no pain.\nMarch 1&th.\u2014After [Imperator] left, Chom resumed control, and\nsaid he wished to give a test. We all joined hands, Mr. Percival\nstanding up and leaning over the table, so as to reach my hands. We\ngrasped hands, and our palms were upwards. Whilst in that position\na flood of scent (verbena) was poured into our hands. Mr. Percival's\nhand was filled with more than a teaspoonful. Mrs. Speer received a\nconsiderable quantity, and my hand and arm were thoroughly wet. The\ntable was drenched with scent all round. The door was locked, and\nthe room empty. A more complete objective test cannot be conceived.\nThe whole quantity of scent must have been considerably over a\ntablespoonful. I believe this estimate is very considerably under\nthe mark. An attempt at direct writing failed, the power having been\nused for the scent.1\nWednesday, March 25th.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014We had\nbeen to lunch with Mrs. W., and the conditions were more or less\ndisturbed. Nothing of importance occurred, except the advent of a\nnew spirit, who made a peculiar detonation in mid-air about the level\nof my head, and between me and Mrs. Speer. It was a quite distinct\nsound. The name given was \" Lottie, daughter of Sir Everard Buck-\nworth,\"\u2014passed away a century ago in Jermyn-street. The power\nceased after Everard, and we broke up. In the dining-room after\nwards raps came again, and the surname Buckworth was given. The\nfollowing morning a message was written through my hand to the\neffect that she died December 5th, 1773, at the house of one Dr. Baker,\na friend, in Jermyn-street. She died of disease of the heart while\ndancing. She had \" looked in,\" and was gone again.\n[This death is recorded in the Annual Register.

We sat on the previous evening,\nwithout much result, except some very bright lights of the Prophet's.\nTo-night lights commenced again, but of a quite different character to\nany we had seen before. They darted about like a comet, coming from\nthe side by the harmonium, or near the fireplace. They were evanescent,\n1 Mrs. Speer's account (Light, December 10th, 1892) is as follows :\u2014\n' ' After Imperator had ceased speaking Chom again controlled, saying he\nwished to give us a test.

We had some ten or twelve of these,\nsome more brilliant than others, some visible both in the looking-glass\nand in the glass of the book-case, and they were showing a trailof reflected\nlight on the table, when suddenly there arose from below me, apparently\nunder the table, or near the floor, right under my nose, a cloud of\nluminous smoke, just like phosphorus. It fumed up in great clouds,\nuntil I seemed to be on fire, and rushed from the room in a panic. I\nwas fairly frightened, and could not tell what was happening. I rushed\nto the door and opened it, and so to the front door. My hands seemed\nto be ablaze, and left their impress on the door and handles. It blazed\nfor awhile after I had touched it, but soon went out, and no\nsmell or trace remained. I have seen my own hands covered with a\nlambent flame ; but nothing like this I ever saw. There seemed to be\nno end of the smoke. It smelt distinctly phosphoric, but the smell\nevaporated as soon as I got out of the room into the air. I was fairly\nfrightened, and was reminded of what I had read about a manifesta-\ntion given to Mr. Peebles similar to the burning bush.\nI have omitted to say that the lights were preceded by very sharp\ndetonations on my chair, so that we could watch for their coming by\nhearing the noise.

The phosphoric\nsubstance was enclosed in an envelope which was materialised. It was\nthe collapse of this envelope that caused the escape of the phosphoric\nsmoke and the smell. This substance was the vital principle, and was\ndrawn from the spine and nerve centres principally, and from all the\nsitters, except those who were of no use or were deterrent.\nApril [18], 1874.\u2014S\u00e9ance at Douglas House.

When I returned home\nI was conscious of the presence of a form, and the name of Judge\nEdmunds was spelt out three or four times. I could not understand\nit, as I had no news of his death. However, on the following Sunday\nI received at Southend a copy of the Medium, in which his death on\nApril 5th was announced.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Mose*. 17\nApril 26<\/i, 1874.\u2014Southend. \u2014Dr. Speer and I went on to the\nPier, which is 1^ miles long, and sat reading at the end of it. Whilst\nso sitting I heard clear metallic raps on the rail in front of us. We\nsatisfied ourselves that the sounds were real and as clear as mi the\ntable. They purported to come from Philoeophus. They were very\nclear and continuous ; they followed us up the Pier as we returned,\nand from time to time we tested them by putting our ears down. In\nthe evening (this was at 4 p.m.) we went on the Pier at 8 p.m., and\ntried the experiment again. A bright moon shone overhead, and we\n-were some half a mile from land, about a third down the Pier. First\nwe tried to elicit raps. I stood beside a post and placed as much of\nmy body in contact with it as I could. Dr. Speer listened for raps.\nThey were distinctly audible at 20, 25, 30, 40, and 50 yards. I could\nhear them well without putting my ear down. After 50 yards Dr.\nSpeer failed to hear them. In the afternoon I thought I heard a faint\nsound of Grocyn, and now his sounds came out as clear and resonant\nas in a closed room. They were distinctly audible to both of us\u2014and\nwe were 70 yards apart\u2014and were apparently made in the space between\nus. At least, the sound was far off apparently to both of us. Had the\nnight been dark I believe the power could have been intensified. It\nstruck me as a very singular fact that such phenomena should occur in\nmid-ocean (so to say) and in good light. with no means of concentrating\nthe power.\nIn the evening we had a seance\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self\u2014in a\nsmall apartment which we occupy here (8, Cashiobury-terrace). Almost\nthe whole of one side of the room is window, which Mrs. Speer\ndarkened as well as she could. The table was an ordinary round table,\nfive feet in diameter. Raps came almost directly, and we had some very\nbeautiful scent, which was like sweet-briar. Mrs. S. had got some\nfresh flowers in the room, with sweet-briar among them and gorse.\nThe Prophet showed his light, although the room was not very dark,\nand Mentor came and showed his light once. He controlled then, and\nsaid that he was not allowed to make lights, as I was so ill (I have a\nbad attack of bronchitis). Grocyn came and played, and a new musical\nsound was made, like a guitar, in the wood of the table. Philosophus\nrapped, and I saw Chom, Mentor, Rector, and others clairvoyantly.\nRector manifested very strongly.1\n1 Mrs. Speer's account of this sitting (Light, December 24th, 1892) begins\nas follows :\u2014\n\"April 26th.\u2014We again sat at Southend, but were not able to darken the\ntoom. I had been suffering from neuralgia all day, and had been alone.\nThrough the day I perceived,'every now and then, delicious scent, which\nbecame more pronounced towards the hour of our meeting, filling the\npassages, Mr. S.

As we sat at the table during the day, Dr. S. writing a business\nletter, we had a long conversation with Chom. He made a peculiar\nknock, sharp and like a detonation, on the floor under the carpet. In\nthe evening we sat, and had quantities of scent of three kinds, one made\nfrom the sweet-briar in the room. Chom controlled, and described the\nmaking of scent over the table near the ceiling. It was showered down\non us over and over again, on our heads, into our hands by request,\nand all about until the air was laden with it. We had Grocyn and\nthe new musical spirit. The Prophet showed his light. Imperator\ncontrolled and spoke for some time ; after which lights again and\nwriting by Chom and Kabbila, an Indian spirit.\nApril 29th, 1874.\u2014Mrs. Honeywood's, 52, Warwick-square, W.\nMrs. H., a lady friend, and myself.\u2014We had the usual phenomena of\nscent, musical sounds, raps, and lights ; the latter brilliant and clear,\nflashing about very brightly. It was a very successful seance, con\nsidered as in a stranger's house, with complete strangers.1\nthat when Dr. S. came in from his evening walk he asked who had been\nburning a pastille. During the seance the spirits informed us that they had\nbeen scenting the house all day. They fanned us with perfumed air as soon\nas we sat down, and rained wet scent over us, which they made from some\nsweetbriar we had in the room. We were deluged with this most fragrant\nperfume ; it fell all over my face, arms, and hands ; it was poured over each\nmember of the circle, and into our hands by request. G. made his usual\nmusical sounds. While he was manifesting Chom impressed Mr. S. M. to\nspeak. He said he saw a spirit near the ceiling making the scent, and we\nshould soon have it rained over us. This was true, as immediately it came\ndown in showers all over the circle and table. The medium then said G.\nwould play, and pointed to the place where he was standing. G. then gave\nus a musical scale, and played different intervals by request. The tone was\npure and clear ; he simulated the sound of pulling a tight and loose string\nof a harp, also a tambourine.\"\u2014M.S.\n1 Mrs. Honeywood sends me an independent, but not contemporary,\naccount of this sitting as follows :\u2014\n\"April 28th, 1874.\u2014Mr. Stainton Moses dined with me and Miss Beale,\nand afterwards proposed trying what we could get. We therefore went\ndownstairs to my boudoir, where Mr. S. M. had never been. We put out\nthe candle, and held hands. Raps soon began, and a cool breeze, then\nquantities of scent fell on our hands, heads, and the table. Lights like the\nflame of a candle darted about between us, over Mr. S. M.'s head, and\nabout the room. Mr. S. M. passed into a trance, and speaking with th\u00bb\nvoice of an old man, but in a very dignified and impressive manner, told us\nthe object of their coming was to teach and elevate mankind. Lights again\nappeared, and scent wet my face and hands.

[Mrs. Speer has no note of this\nspecial occasion, but says that musk was frequently thus deposited on\nand in her desk].\nSunday, May 3rd, 1874.\u2014I was suffering with aggravated bronchial\nattack, and felt very much below par. Raps commenced at once, and\nthroughout the evening the manifestations were very strong. Grocyn's\nsound was very good, commencing, apparently, at a great distance, and\nsounding something like the muffled roll of a big drum. We hod new\nsounds, too, of a zither, very pretty, five in all. They played over my\nhead and round the circle. They were quite independent of the table.\nThey were clear, very highly strung, and apparently graduated, giving\none the idea of an instrument of five strings. We were told that they\nwere made by a new spirit. Scent was very abundant indeed. Clumi\nand Mentor controlled. The most curious part of the seance was that\nin which an elaborate attempt was made to relieve my bronchitis.\nWhen we made the usual break, after sitting for about forty minutes,\nI was perfectly conscious of two materialised hands making passes over\nmy head, throat, chest, and back. After a time I began to throw off\nfrom ruy hands the vitiated magnetism. My hands were thrown about\nso violently that Dr. S. could hardly hold them. At one time my hands\nwere so fast glued to the table that Mrs. S. had to exert all her power\nto get them off. After this I drew power from both sitters by making\npasses over their hands and arms. After all was done I certainly\nfelt and looked much better than I had been for a long time. The\nsensation of the hands was perfectly distinct and unmistakable. As\nthe seance concluded, I hecame clairaudient, and recited a long passage\nfrom Judge Edmunds, who stood by me.

The peculiarity of the s\u00e9ance was that when\nI could hear the sound no one else could, and vice versd. I heard by\nclairaudience and not by natural hearing, being very deaf with my cold.\nOn request I was enabled to hear the sound with my natural ear, but\nI described it long before it was heard by the others, and heard it\nfrequently when they did not. At the same time I was unconscious of\nsounds apparently made on the table under my nose.\nI spent Whitsuntide at Broadlands, where I met Colonel Drayson,\nand had some very interesting conversation with him. The editor of\nthe Fortnightly [Mr John Morley] was there, and I had opportunity of\nseeing the proofs of Wallace's article on Spiritualism. The second\npart is better than the first.\n[Edmund Gurney and I also met Mr. Moses at Broadlands, (Lord\nMount-Temple's,) at this date, and heard from him an account of his\nphenomena concordant with that here given.]\nThursday, June 25th, 1874. \u2014 Dr. and Mrs. S. and Mrs. F.\u2014\nMrs. F. being a new member, there was nothing new done. The usual\nmanifestations, lights, music, and copious scent. I wore a gardenia in\nmy buttonhole, and the scent of it was diffused throughout the room\nmost powerfully. We had other scents, until the atmosphere was so\nloaded that we were glad to get out of it. The flower after the seance\nwas stained and dead, as though all its vitality had been taken out of\nit. This is like the effect we have noticed at Shanklin. Imperator\ncontrolled and spoke clearly.\nFriday, July ith, 1874.\u2014P[ercival] came up unexpectedly, and Mrs.\nS., at dinner, told me about sitting again with Mrs. F. I was startled,\nand an indescribable feeling of fear came over me. When we sat condi\ntions were very disturbed, and nothing came, except at first some very\nfaint rose scent. After sitting a long time, we broke, and resumed. Still\nthe room was dark, And the influence unpleasant. After a time a very\npungent odour of peppermint was diffused through the room. It was\nvery unpleasant.1 While in the garden, before we began to sit, I was\nconscious of scent all round me, especially on my hair. When I rubbed\nmy hair my hand was scented strongly. I tried the experiment many\ntimes. When the peppermint came I was conscious of its presence first\nnear my head, and it seemed, as it were, to be evolved out of the hair.\nI have before noticed the same thing, but not so markedly as on this\noccasion.\nMonday, July 6th, 1874.\u2014We had sat (Dr. S. and I) on Sunday,\nwith no results. We met again to-day, and had a good seance. Grocyn\nmanifested, and we had beautiful scent, rose and some other. The\n1 See Dr. Speer's letter, Proceedings, Vol. IX., p. 339.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Motes.\nProphet's light was clear, and we had a new light, with drapery, very\nsoft and silky, round it. It was a sort of hooded light, with a very\nbright nucleus within it. It seemed to be permanent. At request the\nlight came near, and brushed Dr. and Mrs. Speer's hands. We also\nhad direct writing from Chom. While it was going on we heard\nscraping on the floor, and Dr. Speer, having placed the paper in a par\nticular position, with the pencil on the top of it, thinks that neither\npaper nor pencil had been moved : yet the writing was on the side next\nthe carpet. I was slightly convulsed, and my hands were moved under\nthe table while the writing was going on beneath.\nJuly 12th, 1874.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S., Mr. P., and self.\u2014The weather\nwas close and oppressive. The phenomena were very good, notwith\nstanding. Scent, Grocyn, and a very remarkable manifestation of the\nzither. The sound was the nearest approach to music that we have yet\nhad. The high noises were imitated exactly, and the runs were executed\nwith marvellous precision. Two instruments apparently were used, or\nrather imitated, one with three high strings, and another with seven\nlower ones. The little sounds of the smaller instrument were brought\nout most clearly, and then were followed by an elaborate run on the\nother instrument, as though the finger were drawn rapidly over the\nstrings. The effect was most curious. After I had observed and\nnoted this for a long time I was entranced, and then the sounds moved\nround the circle. Grocyn's sounds were very fine, and scent very\nbeautiful. After the seance was over, the phenomenon of its being\nevolved from my head was very marked. As J rublx'd my hair the\nsmell came out very markedly ; it was the same as had been given\nduring the seance. This phenomenon has now occurred a dozen times\nvery markedly. Imperator controlled, and spoke at length very cheer\nfully.\nSunday, July 26\/h, 1874.\u2014A remarkable seance throughout. I\nwas entranced almost immediately on sitting down, and the trance\nstate had been coming on for some hours before. So thoroughly was it\nestablished that I have no remembrance of anything until I found\nmyself in bed the next morning. I relate what was told me. Every\nphenomenon was intensified ; Grocyn's sounds, the scent, lights\n(Prophet's and Kabbila's), were all there. Dr. S. had put in front of him\na wine-glass, into which he asked the scent might be put. In answer\nto that request a good tablespoonful was poured. This he preserved in\na bottle. Kabbila's lights were hooded, and quite different from the\nProphet's. Catharine knocked very clearly, and gave some messages.\nAt length she rapped out : \" Look at the medium ;\" and after : \" Take\ncare of the medium.\" Mrs. S. naturally thought she meant after the\nseance. She persisted in rapping in an eager, excited way, and after\nsome time a light was struck, and I was discovered to have fallen down\nG 2\n\f52 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nby the book-case, doubled up in a most awkward position, and in a\nprofound trance. My face was bathed for some time before any sign\nof revival showed, and then I could not stand, but slipped down in a\nhelpless way. My legs could not support my body, and my hands\ncould not hold anything. Dr. S. walked home with me, and he says\nthat I could not have walked at all alone. I have no recollection of\nanything, nor do I know how I got to bed, except that I found every\nthing quite straight in the morning. 'We had an engagement with\nHudson at 4 p.m. that day, and I never recovered from the trance until\nafter that. Unfortunately there was a misunderstanding, and\nHudson was out, otherwise I believe we should have had a good\nresult. This is the deepest trance into which I have ever been thrown.\nTo all intents and purposes my consciousness was entirely suspended\nfrom 8 p.m. to 9 a.m. the next day.\n[Mrs. Speer's account of this seance (Light, January 7th, 1893) is\nquite concordant ; but she dates it July 27th ; which, if an error,\nis the only slip of the kind which I have observed in her records.\nI assume Mr. Moses' date to be correct, as he gives the day of the\nweek as well as of the month.]\nClifton.\u2014I spent the last ten days of August with Dr. Thomson.\nDuring that time we experimented in the study for photographs, and got\nresults exactly similar to the previous Clifton photos. We also got a\nhead\u2014a sort of double of mine. We sat several times and got the\nusual phenomena\u2014scent, lights, music, direct writings, and dry musk.\nRoses were scented in my buttonhole, a different scent being put upon\nthem. They turned brown and died. Some scent put into a glass\nduring a seance evaporated during the night in spite of being carefully\ncovered over. Dr. Thomson's eldest son sat with us on the last night\nof my stay. He saw the luminous appearances in the room very clearly,\nand described them exactly as they seemed to me. Two very clearly\ndefined figures were near Dr. T., visible to both of us. We heard a\nnoise like that of a person trying to speak. At last one came close to\nme and said \" Helen \"\u2014that was the name of Dr. T.'s wife. The other\nspirit was his mother, who appeared on the plate at Hudson's some\ntime ago.\nAugust 31st.\u2014Came to Shanklin. Dr. and Mrs. S. and I sat the\nfirst night, and got the usual phenomena. Dr. S. saw a luminous\ncolumn at my right hand, and Imperator, who was controlling, told\nhim it was the Prophet. The light known as his flashed up at once in\nthe midst of it. Kabbila also manifested with his light.\nSeptember 1st.\u2014Same sitters.\u2014We had the three or four-stringed\nlyre of Chom, and Said and his seven-stringed sound. The three-\nstringed was less like a string than any sound we have ever heard. It\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton J\/o$es.\nwas very remarkable. A new spirit manifested by tilts. He gave his\nname Abraham Florentine, and he was in the American War of 1812,\ndied August 5th, 1874, aged 83 years 1 month 17 days, at Brooklyn.\nThe table is a very heavy one, and it requires great strength to tilt it.\nThe power used was enormous, and gave us all severe headaches. [This\nmessage was verified by inquiring at the office of the Adjutant-General\nof the State of New York, and will be again referred to when we\ndiscuss the various evidences of identity in Mr. Moses' experiences.\u2014\nSee p. 82.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nSeptember '2nd, 1874.\u2014Same circle.\u2014The musical manifestations\nwere remarkable\u2014six different sounds were made. Grocyn, Chom,\n'Welsh harper, Said, a noise like a drum made by Kabbila, and the\nsound of a seven-stringed lyre. Said's sound was extraordinary ; a\nhigh treble running note like water dropping on metal. It was scarcely\nlike a string. Kabbila and the Prophet showed their lights, the\nProphet's very bright and triangular in shape. Abraham Florentine\nmade the same peculiar quivering in the table. He came to say that\nthe months and days referred to his age.1\n1 Mrs. Speer's account of the Abraham Florentine sittings is as follows\n(Light, January 21st, 1893) :\u2014\nSeptember Int.\u2014This evening the raps came soon after we had settled\nourselves, and much spirit-light was visible, especially in one corner of the\nroom. By raps we were told that a strange spirit wished to communicate,\nand would do so during the seance. G., Chom, and Said all manifested by\nmaking their different musical sounds. After playing for some time G.\nrapped out, \" We have done.\" The table then began to quiver as if alive.\nIt was a heavy, solid, old-fashioned round table, difficult to more, but it\nwas raised several times, and a spirit rapped on it with much energy, asking\nfor the alphabet, and when it was called gave the name of \"Abraham\nFlorentine.\"\u2666 We asked, \" Where did you live f \" \"Brooklyn.\" And then\nfollowed, \" I fought in the war of 1812.\" \"When did you pass away?\"\n\" I passed August 5th, 1874.\" \" At what age 1 \" \" Eighty-three years, one\nmonth, seventeen days.\" This information was given in a most excited\nmanner, and the table was violently shaken when we did not quite under\nstand the answers. Great power was taken from each of the circle, and we\nwere so upset by the constant violent movements of the table\u2014producing,\neach time it was moved, a kind of electric shock through us\u2014that we had\nthe greatest difficulty in taking the information through the alphabet. The\nspirit at last ceased, and our friend G. came to the rescue. He informed us\nthat the spirit had been chosen by Imperator to give us another proof of\nidentity, and that he had been a Spiritualist in earth-life. We were then\ndeluged with scent and told to cease. Mr. S. M. was in deep trance during\nthe time the information was given.\nSeptember 2nd. \u2014This evening the scent was exquisite; raps came quickly,\n* All the details given were afterwards completely verified. No one present at\nthe seance knew anything about Abraham Florentine.\n\f54 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nSeptember 3rd and ith.\u2014Same circle.\u2014Manifestations similar to\nthose above, but intensified. The musical sounds have reached seven,\nthe new one being like the noise made by striking fine porcelain, but\nwith a very decided ring in it. It is a very singular sound, and is\nmade with great intensity. The three-stringed lyre is also very\nbeautiful, more like the dropping of liquid on a metallic surface than\nanything else. But the sounds are all indescribable.\n1. Grocyn.\u2014Since the seance, when he made such violent mani\nfestations he has been much quieter. The sounds are very pure, and\nexpress feeling most wonderfully. They are most like a thick harp\nstring.\n2. Chom makes the sound of an old Egyptian harp with four strings.\nThere is little similarity to a stringed sound.\n3. Said makes a noise somewhat similar to Chom's, but the lyre\nhas only three strings. It is an old Egyptian instrument, and the\nsound is like dropping water on a steel plate, a sort of liquid sound,\nvery intense. I am told it is very like the sound of a harmonium reed.\n4. Roophal makes a sound of a seven-stringed lyre, very pretty\nrippling sound, but the strings do not seem to me to be arranged in\nharmonial progression.\n5. Kabbila makes a sound like a drum, very deep, a sort of pro\nlonged roll.\n6. makes a sound like the ringing of fine porcelain, only\nthat the ring is very much more pronounced. This is a very intense\nsound.\n7. The Welsh Harper makes a sound as of the highest strings of a\nharp, sharp and ringing.\nIn addition, there is the sound of a tambourine and a sort of\nflapping sound like large wings. These can scarcely be called musical\nin any sense, though they are but exaggerations of others in some way.\nThe modus operandi is similar.\nSeptember 5th, 1874.\u2014Mr. Percival joined us. The musical sounds\nwere repeated, but the principal part of the seance was taken up with\ncommunications about W.H.S., who came with the old grinding\nsound, the influence in the room being very unpleasant. Grocyn com\nmunicated about him, the tones used being very striking. Dr. S.\nand with them several musical sounds. All the stringed instruments were\nheard, and a new sound like a drum. This, we were told, was a manifesta\ntion of Kabbila's. He and [the Prophet] showed their lights. Abraham\nFlorentine came again ; we recognised his presence at once by the violent\ntrembling of the table. We rather objected to his rough manifestations, as\nho used up so much power. G. then interfered and told us the spirit wished\nto say the one month and seventeen days referred to his age.\u2014M.S.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Alosci?.\nasked for the name to be given, and Grocyn spelt out \"Woe.\" He said\nit was his spirit name. G. did not know his earth name. Three of\nthe sitters, Dr. and Mrs. S. and I, knew it perfectly well. Thus is a\nstrong piece of evidence against unconscious cerebration. The know\nledge was there, yet G. said he did not know.\nDr. S. asked for the characteristic of the spirit to be put in one\nword, and Greed was spelt out. Probably no word would so well\nexpress what was wanted. G. could have no communication with him,\nhe said.\nSeptember 7th.\u2014Musical sounds, but not good. After a break some\nremarkable lights were made ; the Prophet's very brilliant indeed.\nMentor came and controlled, and showed a light much smaller than he\nhad shown before. Kabbila also showed his light, and two at least\nwere visible at the same time. The lights never faded during the half-\nhour in which they were visible. Some very fine drapery hung from\nMentor's lamp, which he brushed over the hands and faces of the\nsitters. It was as fine as gossamer, and was lit up by the lamps. At\nrequest M. struck the table with his lamp, and all felt his hand, which\nwas as real as a human hand. He also said that Kabbila had\nmaterialised partly. The lamp struck P.'s head. It was apparently\nofsome such shape as this, brightly luminous, and with drapery brightly\nlit up. During the night I heard the grinding sound very strongly,\nand Grocyn sounded very sweetly. He said \" W.\" wanted prayer, and\ncame to get good and to progress. He would do no harm.1\nmr. MOSeS' SketCH OF MentOr'S lamP and draPery.\nlA seance, during the whole of which Mr. Moses was entranced, may\nhere be described in Mrs. Speer's words (Light, January 28th, 18!I3) :\u2014\nSeptember 10th.\u2014Mr. Percival having left Shanklin, this evening the\ncircle sat alone. The room soon seemed full of foggy light, and Catharine\nquickly rapped. G. sounded three musical notes ; through the alphabet he\ntold us that, though the atmosphere was bad, we were to sit and they would\ndo all they could for us. Mr. S. M. was deeply entranced, and continued in\nthat state all through the seance. The stringed instruments were played,\n\f56 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nSeptember 19th.\u2014Same circle and place.\u2014Whilst walking up and\ndown before the- windows in the garden I distinctly heard the sound of\nthe fairy bells in the air. They seemed to come from a distance, and\nwere sweet and clear. Both Dr. and Mrs. Speer heard them as well as\nmyself. When we sat down they began again, and I heard them very\nclearly. They seemed to come from a great distance, and gradually\ncame on the table. I then became entranced, and the sounds are\ndescribed as being very remarkable, long runs being made, and the\nsounds running up and down, so that the wood seemed to be alive.\nCatharine knocked very loudly, and seemed to be in command. The\nthree and four-stringed instruments were played while I was awake and\nthoroughly able to appreciate what was going on. After that came\nthe seven-stringed instrument, played, as we were informed, by a third\nEgyptian, Roophal, contemporary with Chom and Said. The sounds\nwere very distinct, and I was able to question and elicit replies. The\nreply was made by striking three strings once or twice, as occasion\nrequired. Abundant scent (jasmine) was showered down. Dr. Speer\nhad asked for some before we sat\u2014we had forgotten to put a glass on\nthe table. There must have been an ounce or more of it. Grocyn's\nsound was very powerful and sweet. I have not before had so good\nan opportunity of hearing the sounds. They are incredible to anyone\nwho has not been led up gradually, as we have been. The purity and\nintensity of them is beyond description.1\nand the sounds evoked were delightful and startling ; chord after chord was\nplayed witli great strength and rapidity. This manifestation lasted for some\ntime. Dr. S. then remarked that many spirits seemed to have left us, and\nmentioned the name of Dr. Dee In a few moments he manifested, striking\nthe table a tremendous blow ; both the medium and myself were greatly\nupset. Mr. S. M. began to move and groan as if in pain. The shock was\nso sudden that it made us feel cold, and the conditions became inharmonious.\nSuddenly the room grew very bright, and I felt enveloped in a cloud of light\nand exquisite scent. This was wafted over us. Liquid scent was also\nshowered over our hands and heads. This delicious perfume brought\nharmony, and we heard raps, asking for the alphabet. The message given\nwas \" Benjamin Franklin is present.\" I then heard a sweet tinkling sound\nlike a clear bell close to my ear; it moved and played in front of the medium,\nwho was still deeply entranced, and afterwards it played over the middle of\nthe table, when Dr. S. heard it for the first time. It was a striking mani\nfestation, the notes were so clear, sweet, and low\u2014we named it \"fairy\nbeds.\"\u2014M.S.\n1 Mrs. Speer's account of this sitting, and summary of sounds made, may\nhere be given (Light, January 28th, 1893) :\u2014\nSeptember 19th.\u2014Before meeting this evening we heard the \" fairy bells \"\nplaying in different parts of the garden, where we were walking ; at times\nthey sounded far off, seemingly playing at the top of some high elm trees,\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. .-7\nSeptember 20fJi, 1874.\u2014Same place and circle.\u2014Our last sitting\nhad a totally different result from what we expected. Imperator\nusually comes to bid us farewell. On thus occasion I was almi\u00abt\nentirely free from influence, and Mrs. Speer was almost entirely en\ntranced. Dr. Speer also experienced the same tingling in his hands.\nDuring the sitting I saw a luminous hand moving about the room, and\nunder it a round luminous object. This I saw repeatedly, and each\ntime some little round object fell, either on the table, on our hands, or\nmusic and stars mingling together, then they would approach nearer to us,\neventually following us into the seance-room, which opened on to the lawn.\nAfter we were seated the music still lingered with us, playing in the corners\nof the room, and then over the table round which we were sitting. They\nplayed scales and chords by request, with the greatest rapidity, and copied\nnotes Dr. S. made with his voice. After Mr. S. M. was entranced the\nmusic became louder and sounded like brilliant playing on the piano. There\nwas no instrument in that room. The sound we called the seven-stringed\ninstrument became coherent for the first time this evening, and answered\nquestions through the alphabet with this instrument instead of rapping on\nthe table. The spirit told us that he was an Egyptian, his name was\nRoophal, he had been a priest in the Temple of Osiris, and a friend of Said\nand Chom. The scent was most abundant, and was thrown all over the\ntable and circle. It had been brought for us to save, but as we had for\ngotten to place a gloss on the table, they threw it over us in large quanti\nties. We had mentioned before commencing the seance that we should\nlike more scent to add to what had already been obtained and bottled.\nDuring our visit to Shanklin so many different musical sounds were\ndeveloped that I propose now placing them on record.\nG., who had manifested so long in the circle, and whose sounds resemble\na harp, tambourine, and double bass.\nThe Welsh Harper, who always played apparently on a very small harp,\nmaking high notes, on very tight strings.\nChom and Said played on instruments which consist of three or four\nstrings.\nRoophat on a seven-stringed instrument. This was like a very sweet\nharp playing in the air.\nWe had also Kabbila's drum sound, and the one, for want of a better\nname, we called the plate sound, as it resembled a sound that could be\n]oade on a china plate turned upside down and struck with a small hammer.\nFairy bells. Introduced when Benjamin Franklin first manifested in our\ncircle. We had always associated these sounds with him and the spirits\nwho came with him. It was an exquisite manifestation, something like a\nmusical box, but more ethereal, and the notes sweeter. We used to\nhear it playing about us very often at this time, especially when out in the\ngarden late at night. It was our habit to open the casement window and\nstep on to the lawn after our seance was concluded, and I often heard these\n\" fairy bells \" playing at midnight among the trees, the effect being very\nbeautiful and unearthly.\u2014M.S.\n\f58 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\non our heads. These were afterwards found to be round beads, such\nas we have had before. After the seance was over I was smoking, the\ngas was lighted, and we were walking about, with the window wide\nopen on to the garden, when the pearls began to fall again. They\ndescended in a shower from the ceiling, or dropped about the carpet,\nuntil there were some thirty of them, O about this size. In one\ncase a shower fell on my head and scattered all over the room, just as\nthe Guimauve lozenges had done on a previous occasion. The light\nwas full, and we all saw the thing done over and over again. At night\nsome musk was put on my dressing-table. I had seen the hand\napparently holding a luminous powder magnetically suspended under\nit, at the distance of an inch apparently. All the power during this\nseries of seances has apparently been devoted to the musical sounds,\nand to attempts to influence the other members of the circle. The\nsounds have increased both in intensity, tone, and variety. No direct\nwriting and but little light. The room markedly full of luminous\nvapour. Attempt at direct voice once.1\n1 Mr. Moses' accounts have by this time become somewhat irregular. I\nquote Mrs. Speer's account of a sitting on October 17th, 1874 :\u2014\nOctober 17th.\u2014This evening, as soon as the gas was extinguished, the\nroom appeared full of spirit-light. Mr. S. M. saw and described G. His\nmusical sounds appeared to come from the place he said he was occupying.\nThen he mentioned Catharine, and she immediately tapped on the corner of\nthe table, where he saw her standing. After this he said : \"Judge Edmonds\nis here.\" We asked if he could write for us. A message came through raps :\n\" We cannot write.\" The \"fairy bells\" played round the circle. Chora,\nthen spoke through Mr. S. M., saying that this manifestation was made by\nBenjamin Franklin. Before meeting Mr. S. M. had taken three rings from\nhis hands and threaded them on to his watch-chain ; his watch was on one\nend of the chain, and a small pocket barometer on the other ; both of these\narticles he placed in side pockets of his waistcoat, the rings hanging midway\non his chain in full sight of the circle. We suddenly saw a pillar of light\nadvance from a corner of the room, stand between me and Dr. S., then pass\nthrough the table to Mr. S. M. In a moment the figure flashed back again\nbetween us and threw something hard down upon the table. We passed our\nhands over the table, and found the rings had been removed from the\nmedium's chain without his knowledge. Catharine then rapped very joy\nfully, asking for the alphabet ; the message given through it was \" Franklin\ndid it. Cease.\" During the next fortnight we held several short seances,\nwith the usual manifestations of scent, musical sounds, raps, and light.\u2014M.S.\nAgain, on November 16th, Mrs. Speer records an interesting s\u00e9ance.\n(Light, February 25th, 1893) :\u2014\nNovember 16th, 1874.\u2014The circle met as usual. Baps were heard on the\ntable before I had closed and locked the door. The room was soon filled,\nwith masses of spirit-light. Mr. S. M. had been spending the day with\nus, as he was not well. Several times during the day wet scent of the most\n\fThe ExpeTieTices of W.

Little dropping sounds on the table, which\nturned out to be very minute beads. Two other sizes afterwards\nbrought\u2014in all there must have been five or six dozen. Beautiful\nsounds of the fairy bells. I saw Grocyn making the sounds ; he\nstood pointing at the table, and as he pointed the sound was made.\nBehind him stood Franklin. As the power failed, F. seemed to put\nmore into him by passes. He gradually faded, and the sound ceased.\nVast quantities of scent have been poured down lately, and the very\nsingular phenomenon of the effusion of scent from the crown of my head\nhas been very marked. It is usually verbena, and oozes out from the\nscalp. I have been suffering from neuralgia, and the process is remedial,\nI believe. The odour is extremely strong.\n[The entries after this point lose their regular sequence of dates.]\nDecember 1'2th, 1874.\u2014The effusion of scent has continued at inter\nvals, being most marked when I am suffering pain. The odour is\nverbena, strong enough to be perceptible throughout the house. I\nhave ascertained from Mrs. Acworth that she is the subject of the\nsame phenomenon, though in her case it is not traceable to any spot.\nThe odour is rose, and diffuses itself when she is tired and the power\nexhausted. She is told that the object is to ward off undesirable\ninfluences.\nNovember 2.1th.\u2014After a seance at Douglas House I went to bed\nabout twelve, and soon fell asleep. Alxmt 2. 15 a.m. I woke up suddenly\nwith a start, wide awake, and with an indefinable sensation that\nsomething was about to happen. I lay on my back looking up at the\nfragrant description oozed from the crown of his head. When it was coming,\nhe said.there seemed to be an icy cold circle round the part of his head which\nbecame wet with the scent. While he was exjleriencing this sensation, if we\nput our fingers on the spot they were wetted with the most fragrant scent,\nsometimes verbena, but more frequently sandalwood. A cambric handker\nchief placed on his head at such times would retain the scent for a long\nperiod. We were told it was a remedial process, and the medium felt greatly\nbenefited by the treatment. Much exquisite sandalwood scent was thrown\nover the circle and table. Kabbila sounded his drum and G. his double-bass.\nDr. S. then remarked : \" We have never heard any wind instrument played.\"\nA minute after the remark, a blast as from a trumpet came between Mr.\nS. M. and myself. It was of the most startling character, and the note was\nrepeated several times. The medium felt very cold and uncomfortable\nduring this new manifestation. He saw the spirit who had made it standing\nnear the harmonium. We were told afterwards that it was made by\nBenjamin Franklin, the most powerful of the physical spirits, and he hoped\nhe would do much for us in the future. Dr. S. asked if they could make the\nharmonium sound ; it was closed, but when Mr. S. M. blew, several notes\nwere sounded.\u2014M.S.\n\f60 Tha Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nceiling, and saw above me a luminous hand, such as I had seen before\nin s\u00e9ances, with the fingers gathered together and holding in attraction\nunder them what looked like a little ball of fire as big as a pea. As I\nlooked the fingers were unclasped, the hand opened, and the little ball\nof fire fell on my beard. So impressed was I with the reality of the\nvision that I jumped out of bed at once and looked for what had struck\nme. I got a light, and discovered on the bed a small opalescent stone\nabout the size of a large pea. It was of a brown hue, shot with pale\nblue. I have since discovered that it is called Sapphirium ; it is a\nBrazilian stone largely imitated in Paris.\nOn Thursday, December 10th, we had a sitting at Douglas House.\nDr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014We burnt some gum in a little bronze\ncenser, and put it flaming in the middle of the table. As it died out a\nnumber of little taps began round it and near Mrs. Speer. These\nincreased, each little detonation being accompanied with a little puff of\nsmoke, as it appeared to me. After this had lasted some time we were\ntold to get light, and look in the middle of the table. We did so, and\nfound nothing. Astonished at this, for we have always found hitherto\nwhat we were told to look for, we put out the light, and it was rapped\nout, \" There is nothing.\" We could not understand, and thought some\nplayful spirit was making fun of us. \" Join hands \" was rapped out,\nand instantly I became very violently convulsed. It was as much as\nDr. Speer could do to hold my hands. As the violent convulsions\nthreatened to injure my hands against the censer, Mrs. Speer re\nmoved it to the corner of the table next to Dr. Speer. When the\nfit passed off my head fell on the table, and it was necessary to support\nme in my chair to prevent me from falling. I gradually regained con\nsciousness, and when light was struck two little stones were found in\nthe censer, similar to the one in my possession.\nWe have lately (December 3rd) had a sitting, with Mr. and Miss\nPercival and Miss B.1 added to our circle. All the phenomena very\nstrong, and, in addition, we had two pieces of direct writing on the\ntable, one a signature, the facsimile on large scale of Ben. Franklin,\nand the other of Kabbila and Rector. I saw the luminous hand\nwriting the signature of Franklin. When complete the paper was\ntaken up from Mrs. Speer's hand, near which it lay, and carried into\nthe air, falling on Miss Percival's hand. The other was similarly\ncarried up, and fell on Dr. Speer's hand. The fairy bells have also\ndeveloped great power.\nSaturday, January Kith, 1875.\u2014The sapphire which was brought\nto me I had set by Leroy and Son (Regent-street) in a ring, with\nrespect to which I received a number of directions. When it arrivetl\n1 There is a concordant account in Miss Birkett's notes.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nwe held a sitting, as we were told that they wished to remove from it\nthe influence it had contracted by being in other hands. I placed the\nring on my silk handkerchief, in the middle of the table, and at once\nit was surrounded by a luminous vapour. Knocks of all kind-* were\ngoing on all over the table, some six or eight clearly distinguishable.\nMrs. Speer once put her hand near the ring, and when she withdrew it\nit was luminous. The Prophet showed his little light all over it, and\nclose to our faces and hands, at the very end of our lingers. The\nwhole scene was very striking and curious. I was warned very strongly\nnot to allow the ring to go into other hands.1\n1 Two quotations from Mr. Moses' letters to Mrs. Speer (Light. December\n24th, 1892. and December 31st, 1892) may here be given :\u2014\nBedford, April 2nd, 1875.\n\" I have nothing particular to tell you in the spiritual way. I had a very\ninteresting communication on Easter Sunday, which succeeded a by no\nmeans interesting early morning experience. The Moravians, as you may\nremember, wake up the dead by singing over their graves at the unearthly\nhour of six a.m. on Easter Day. Whether the ' dead ' resent this treatment\nor not I do not know, but for the last two Easters they have visited me with\ntheir complainings. Last Easter they annoyed me more than enough. This\nEaster I was conscious of their presence less by the physical than the spiritual\nsense. They did not make so much noise, but the room seemed to swarm\nwith them. It is a mysterious question, that of the attraction of spirits to\nearth by the direction of our spirits to them. I believe that therein lies one\nof the keys to the whole question of spirit intercourse. My communication\nwas from Theophilus, on the spiritual significance of the Christian festival. ''\nMrs. Moses' house at Bedford is near a Moravian burying ground. From\nthe same place Mr. Moses writes again :\u2014\n\"August Ist, 1875.\u2014There have been some very subtle and beautiful\nperfumes here. My mother can't at all make out where they come from.\nThree little pearls also made their appearance on the table the other day.\nI have also had a little ruby and sapphire and emerald : all small\u2014the size\nof your rubies.\n\" Mentor was the cunning workman who fashioned the cameo. He is not\ncontent with his work, which he says was bad, and that he can do much\nbetter. He actually carved it, he says. And I see no reason to doubt it,\nseeing that I can find no limit to spirit-power. If they are allowed to work\nin their own way they can do almost anything. It is only when we compel\nthem to work in lines prescribed by us that they find any difficulty.\n\" We are on the very threshold of the subject : even those who know\nmost. The vast mass of Spiritualists have no sort of idea of the matter, and\nI doubt whether this age ever will have.\"\nAnother sitting may be described from Mrs. Speer's record (Light, May\n13th, 1893) :\u2014\n\"February 4th, 1875.\u2014We met as usual. Rector manifested strongly,\nshaking the room and the chairs on which we were sitting. It appeared as\n\fG2 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nAugust 27tk, 1875.\u2014Dudley Villa, Shanklin.\u2014During the interval\nthat has passed since my last record the manifestations have developed,\nand some new ones have been added. The musical sounds have been\nadded to by a long single note like that made by a tuning-fork. The\nscent continues. We have had fewer lights than usual. Several small\ngems (ruby, sapphire, emerald, as well as some pearls, a moonstone, and\nothers) have been brought. Some time since a cameo was cut during a\nseance at Douglas House. It was rudely done, but the result was very\nremarkable. Last night the experiment was repeated under very satis\nfactory circumstances. As soon as the s\u00e9ance commenced I passed into\nthe trance state. I derived my information from Dr. and Mrs. Speer,\nwho alone were present. A long message was rapped out by Catharine.\nShe said they had brought a shell, and were going to cut a cameo ;\nthat I was in trance \"for the night,\" and that I was to be left alone till\nmorning, and not to be told of what was done. A light was struck,\nand Dr. and Mrs. S. saw a shell in the middle of the table. I was in\ndeep trance. Grocyn played, and the fairy bells. There was abundant\nscent of a particularly sweet kind. Then Mentor came and Imperator.\nAfter he left light was called for, and in the centre of the table was a\ncameo and a quantity of debris of shell. Noises had been heard as of\npicking, and I saw a hand. The shell is more clearly cut than the first,\nand shows a head, laurel-crowned. It is polished inside, and shows\nplain marks of the graving tool. The seance lasted about an hour.\nEnd of Quotations from Note-Books.\nHere Mr. Moses' notebooks of physical seances end, although\nthere are from time to time allusions to physical phenomena in his\nbooks of automatic script. Mrs. Speer's records continue until May\n2nd, 1880, and show that the phenomena, though rarer, continued\nif a very heavy man stood behind our chairs, jumping up and down with\ngreat vigour. Scent came very abundantly, and G. manifested with his\nmusical sounds. After sitting for some time we heard a most melancholy\nnoise, which sounded like the wailing of the wind passing through an iron\ngrating. It grew louder and was a most weird sound, giving the impression of\nunrest, wailing, and woe. We all felt awe-struck, especially when we were\ninformed that the sound was produced by a large body of undeveloped\nspirits who were trying to get to us ; but our band of spirits would not\nallow them to approach near the circle. We had never heard so awful a\nsound as this before. We were then informed by a spirit controlling that\nImperator had permitted them to come, hoping that the spirit-atmosphere\nround the circle would benefit them, and he had trusted they were more\nprogressed than they appeared to be.\u2014M.S.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 03\nmuch the same. A letter of Mr. Moses to Mrs. Speer, dated April,\n1876, foreshadows their gradual disappearance.\n\"I send you a packet which you will see is 'spiritual.' It contains a\nfragment of spirit-drapery sweetened by some spirit musk. Magus is the\noperator, and I believe Mentor with him. At any rate, those two have been\nat work. I think that the musk smells more powerfully than usual. T had\na long and very beautiful communication from Tmperator yesterday (Easter\nDay) which I am minded to copy out and print. Easter Day seems to be\na favourite with them. I have had a message on that day every year. The\nidea is the passage from Death to Life symbolised by the Crucifixion and\nResurrection, and typifying the death of Self Denial and Self Sacrifice lead\ning to the Regeneration or Resurrection of the Spirit from dead Matter to\nthe higher life. It is well worked out, and very striking. There was also a\ncommunication written out about the state of affairs in the spiritual world.\nYou must read what Imperator says. He does not speak hopefully, and\nwishes us not to meet yet, though he evidently contemplates the resuming\nof our circle hereafter. But by that time, he says, my physical mediumship\nwill either be absolutely under control, so as to be no longer fraught with\ndanger, or will have ceased. The latter seems to be implied, though he\nseems to hint that material evidence will always be forthcoming. He is very\ndecisive in saying what he does, and says that we are none of us ettr left.\nIt gives me a very strong idea of pre-arranged plans and of wise and power\nful protection. He evidently looks far ahead ; his plans now are for the far\nfuture, and the mind is first prepare'!. I am quite conscious of that.\n\"I shall probably hear more before we see each other. I heard nothing\nof the Moravians this year, nor was I conscious of any ' presence,' which\nlooks like a withdrawal from the objective. But Mentor's drapery and musk\nare objective enough.\"\n\u00a3,' The letter from which these extracts are taken\" (adds Mrs. Speer) \" still\nretains the scent of the musk referred to at the commencement, as\n' sweetening the spirit-drapery,' although it was written nearly seven\nteen years ago. The drapery is lost, but the strong perfume of musk\nremains fresh and pungent.\"]\nOn May 2nd, 1 880, occurred the last sitting which Mrs. Speer has\nrecorded. She concludes her records in I.ight (October 21st, 1893)\nwith the following words :\u2014\n\"I have now come to the end of the seances at which any notes were\nproperly taken. Other meetings we have since had occasionally, and at\ntimes Imperator spoke through Mr. S. M. until within a few months of his\ndecease. Raps were sometimes heard and messages given. Musk and coral\nwere also brought and scattered over the room at several different times. Half\nthat took place could not be recorded, and often the addresses were imperfectly\ntaken down. It is also impossible to give any idea of the impression pro\nduced upon the circle by the beauty and refinement of some of the manifes\ntations, or by the power and dignity of Imperator's influence and personality.\nAnd now I may say, in concluding what has been to me a most pleasant\ntask, that if a perusal of these personal records of the most interesting\n\f64 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nexperiences I have ever been through should in any way lead inquirers to\nrealise how far more elevating a study the higher aspects of Spiritualism\npresent than the investigation of the mere phenomena with which the subject\nis usually associated, in this case I shall feel that the preparation and publi\ncation of these ' Records ' will have borne good fruit, and that my work\nwill have not been undertaken in vain.\u2014M.S.\"\nHere these citations from reports of the seances may, I think,\nfitly close. Mrs. Speer's fuller accounts are accessible in Light ; and I\nassume that Mr. Moses' own record of seances will be somewhere\naccessible to future students. The remaining records by Dr. Speer,\nMiss Birkett,1 and Mrs. Garratt, which I have left unprinted, are\nfully concordant, and will, I suppose, be similarly preserved. Such\npapers as I have any control over will be deposited in the archives of\nthe S.P.R. There is a good deal of correspondence, &c., which I have\nexamined, without finding any discrepancy worth mentioning in any\nof the accounts. For my own part, I see no way in which these\nrecords could have come into existence, with the support of the four\nliving witnesses known to me, except on the hypothesis of their sub\nstantial truth.\nSection B.\u2014Examination of Automatic Writings.\nB.\u2014The next division of our work must be an examination of\nthe automatic writings. The 24 books of these writings, already-\ndescribed, although mostly of small size, contain, of course, far more\nmatter than can be printed here. I propose to deal with these as\nfollows. In Sections B, C, D, I shall analyse the bulk of the evidence\nwhich they contain bearing on the question of spirit-identity. In\nSection E, I hope later on to discuss the rationale of the physical\nmanifestations, and to quote matter from these notebooks bearing-\nthereon ; especially the record of certain phenomena occurring to\nMr. Moses when alone, with which the automatic messages are inter\nspersed. In Section F I hope to give a brief resume of the \" Spirit\nTeachings,\" already published in part in the book of that name,\nand of which further specimens may, I hope, be published hereafter.\nThese automatic messages were almost wholly written by Mr. Moses'\nown hand, while he was in a normal waking state. The exceptions are\nof two kinds. (1) There is one long passage, which must some time be\nfurther discussed, alleged by Mr. Moses to have been written by himself\nwhile in a state of trance. (2) There are, here and there, a few words\nalleged to be in \" direct writing\";\u2014written, that is to say, by invisible\nhands, but in Mr. Moses' presence ; as already several times described\nin the notes of seances.\n1 Miss Birkett's notes cease June 7th, 1880.\n\fThe Experiences of IF. Stainton Moses. r,:l\nPutting these exceptional instances aside, we find that the\nwritings generally take the form of a dialogue, Mr. Moses proposing\na question in his ordinary thick, black handwriting. An answer is\nthen generally, though not always, given ; written also by Mr. Moses,\nand with the same pen, but in some one of various scripts which\ndiffer more or less widely from his own. The evidential value of these\nhandwritings will be discussed hereafter. In the meantime Mr.\nMoses' own description of the process, as given in the preface to\nSpirit Teachings, may be studied with advantage.\n\" The communications which form the bulk of this volume were received\nby the process known as automatic or passive writing. This is to be\ndistinguished from Psychography. In the former case the psychic holds the\npen or pencil, or places his hand upon the planchette, and the message is\nwritten without the conscious intervention of his mind. In the latter case\nthe writing is direct, or is obtained without the use of the hand of the\npsychic, and sometimes without the aid of pen or pencil.\n\" Automatic writing is a well-known method of communication with the\ninvisible world of what we loosely call Spirit. I use that word as the\nmost intelligible to my readers, though I am well aware that I shall be told\nthat I ought not to apply any such term to many of the unseen beings who\ncommunicate with earth, of whom we hear much and often as being the\nreliquioe of humanity, the shells of what were once men. It Is no part of my\nbusiness to enter into this ghost question. My interlocutors call themselves\nspirits, perhaps because I so call them, and spirits they are to me for my\npresent purposes.\n\"These messages began to be written through my hand just ten years\nsince\u2014March 30th, 1873\u2014about a year after my first introduction to\nSpiritualism. I had had many communications before, and this method\nwas adopted for the purpose of convenience, and also to preserve what was\nintended to be a connected body of teaching. The laborious method of\nrapping out messages was manifestly unfitted for communications such as\nthose which I here print. If spoken through the lips of the medium in\ntrance they were partially lost, and it was moreover impossible at first to\nrely upon such a measure of mental passivity as would preserve them from\nadmixture with his ideas. I procured a pocket book which I habitually\ncarried about with me. I soon found that writing flowed more easily when\nI used a book that was permeated with the psychic aura ; just as raps come\nmore easily on a table that has been frequently used for the purpose, and as\nphenomena occur most readily in the medium's own room.\n\" At first the writing was very small and irregular, and it was necessary\nfor me to write slowly and cautiously, and to watch the hand, following the\nlines with my eye ; otherwise the message soon became incoherent, and the\nresult was mere scribble. In a short time, however, I found that I could\ndispense with these precautions. The writing, while becoming more and more\nminute, became at the same time very regular and beautifully formed. As\na specimen of caligraphy some of the pages are exceedingly beautiful. The\nanswers to my questions (written at the top of the page) were paragraphed\nand arranged as if for the press, and the name of God was always written in\nH\n\f66 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\ncapitals and slowly, and, as it seemed, reverentially. The subject-matter\nwas always of a pure and elevated character, much of it being of personal\napplication, intended for my own guidance and direction. I may say that\nthroughout the whole of these written communications, extending in\nunbroken continuity to the year 1880, there is no flippant message, no\nattempt at jest, no vulgarity or incongruity, no false or misleading state\nment, so far as I know or could discover ; nothing incompatible with the\navowed object, again and again repeated, of instruction, enlightenment, and\nguidance by spirits fitted for the task. Judged as I should wish to be\njudged myself, they were what they pretended to be. Their words were\nwords of sincerity, and of sober, serious purpose.\n\"The earliest communications were all written in the minute characters\nthat I have described, and were uniform in style and in the signature,\n'Doctor, the Teacher,' nor have his messages ever varied during all the\nyears that he has written. Whenever and wherever he wrote, his hand\nwriting was unchanged, showing, indeed, less change than my own does\nduring the last decade. The tricks of style remained the same, and there\nwas in short a sustained individuality throughout his messages. He is to\nme an entity, a personality, a being with his own idiosyncrasies and\ncharacteristics quite as clearly denned as the human beings with whom I\ncome in contact, if, indeed, I do not do him injustice by the broad\ncomparison.\n\"After a time, communications came from other sources, and these were\ndistinguished each by its own handwriting, and by its own peculiarities of\nstyle and expression. These, once assumed, were equally invariable. I\ncould tell at once who was writing by the mere characteristics of the\ncaligraphy.\n'' By degrees I found that many spirits who were unable to influence my\nhand themselves sought the aid of a spirit ' Rector,' who was apparently\nable to write more freely and with less strain on me ; for writing by a spirit\nunaccustomed to the work was often incoherent, and always resulted in a\nserious drain upon my vital powers. They did not know how easily the\nreserve of force was exhausted, and I suffered proportionately.\n\" Moreover, the writing of the spirit who thus became a sort of\namanuensis was fluent and easy to decipher, whereas that of many spirits\nwas cramped, archaic in form, and frequently executed with difficulty and\nalmost illegible. So it came to pass, as a matter of ordinary course,\n' Rector ' wrote, but when a spirit came for the first time, or when it was\ndesired to emphasise a communication, the spirit responsible for the\nmessage wrote for himself.\n\" It must not be assumed, however, that all messages proceeded from one\nsolitary inspiration. In the case of the majority of the communications\nprinted in this volume this is so. The volume is a record during which\n' Imperator ' was alone concerned with me, though, as he never attempted\nwriting, ' Rector ' acted as his amanuensis. At other times, and especially\nsince that time, communications have apparently proceeded from a\ncompany of associated spirits, who have used their amanuensis for the\npurpose of their message. This was increasingly the case during the last\nfive years that I received these communications.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\n\"The circumstances under which the messages were written were\ninfinitely varied. As a rule it was necessary that I should be isolated, and\nthe more passive my mind the more easy the communications. But I have\nreceived messages under all sorts of conditions. At tirst they came\nwith difficulty, but soon the mechanical method appeared to be mastered,\nand page after page was covered with matter of which the specimens contained\nin this book will enable the public to judge.\n\"What is now printed has been subjected to revision by a method similar\nto that by which it was first written. Originally published in the Hpiritwilist\nnewspaper, the messages have been revised but not substantially altered by\nthose who first wrote them. When the publication in the Spiritualist was\ncommenced, I had no sort of idea of doing what is now being done.\nFriends desired specimens to be published, and the selection was made\nwithout any regard to continuity. I was governed only by a desire to avoid\nthe publication of what was of personal interest only, and I, perforce,\nexcluded much that involved allusion to those still living, whom 1 had no\nright to drag into print. I disliked printing personal matter relating to\nmyself ; I had, obviously, no right to print that which concerned others.\nSome of the most striking and impressive communications have thus been\nexcluded, and what is printed must be regarded as a mere sample of what\ncannot see the light now, and which must be reserved for consideration at a\nremote period, when I and those concerned can no longer be aggrieved by\nits publication.\n\"It is an interesting subject for speculation whether my own thoughts\nentered into the subject-matter of the communications. I took extraordi\nnary pains to prevent any such admixture. At first the writing was slow,\nand it was necessary for me to follow it with my eye, but even then the\nthoughts were not my thoughts. Very soon the messages assumed a\ncharacter of which I had no doubt whatever that the thought was opposed\nto my own. But I cultivated the power of occupying my mind with other\nthings during the time that the writing was going on, and was able to read\nan abstruse book, and follow out a line of close reasoning while the message\nwas written with unbroken regularity. Messages so written extended over\nmany pages, and in their course there is no correction, no fault in compo\nsition, and often a sustained vigour and beauty of style.\n\"I am not, however, concerned to contend that my own mind was not\nutilised, or that what was thus written did not depend for its form on the\nmental qualifications of the medium through whom it was given. So far as\nI know it is always the case that the idiosyncrasies of the medium are\ntraceable in such communications. It is not conceivable that it should be\notherwise. But it is certain that the mass of ideas conveyed to me were\nalien to my own opinions, were, in the main, opposed to my settled\nconvictions, and, moreover, that in several cases, information of which I\nwas assuredly ignorant, clear, precise, and definite in form, susceptible of\nverification, and always exact, was thus conveyed to me. As, at many of the\nseances, spirits came and rapped out on the table clear and precise informa\ntion about themselves, which we afterwards verified, so, on repeated\noccasions, was such information conveyed to me by this method of automatic\nwriting.\n\f68 The Experiences of W. Stainton Hoses.\n\" I argue from the one case to others. In one I can positively assert\nand prove the conveyance of information new to me. In others I equally\nbelieve that I was in communication with an external intelligence which\nconveyed to me thoughts other than my own. Indeed, the subject-matter\nof many of the communications printed in this volume will, by its own\ninherent quality, probably lead to the same conclusion.\n\"I never could command the writing. It came unsought usually, and\nwhen I did seek it, as often as not I was unable to obtain it. A sudden\nimpulse, coming I knew not how, led me to sit down and prepare to\nwrite. Where the messages were in regular course I was accustomed to\ndevote the first hour of each day to sitting for their reception. I rose early,\nand the beginning of the day was spent, in a room that I used for no other\npurpose, in what was to all intents and purposes a religious service. These\nwritings frequently came then, but I could by no means reckon upon them.\nOther forms of spirit-manifestation came too ; I was rarely without some\nunless ill-health intervened, as it often did of late years, until the messages\nceased.\n\" The particular communications which I received from the spirit known\nto me as Imperator mark a distinct epoch in my life.\n\"I have noted in the course of my remarks the intense exaltation of\nspirit, the strenuous conflict, the intervals of peace, that I have since\nlonged for, but have seldom attained, which marked their transmission. It\nwas a period of education in which I underwent a spiritual development\nthat was in its outcome a very regeneration. I cannot hope, I do not try,\nto convey to others what I then experienced. But it may possibly be borne\nin upon the minds of some who are not ignorant of the dispensation of the\nspirit in their own inner selves, that for me the question of the beneficent\naction of external spirit on my own self was then finally settled. I have\nnever since, even in the vagaries of an extremely sceptical mind, and amid\nmuch cause for questioning, ever seriously entertained a doubt.\"\nA prolonged study of the M.S. books has revealed nothing incon\nsistent with this description. I have myself, of course, searched\nthem carefully for any sign of confusion or alteration, but without\nfinding any ; and I have shown parts of them to various friends,\nwho have seen no points of suspicion. I am permitted by the\nexecutors to show such parts as contain no private matter, at my\ndiscretion, to students interested in the enquiry ; and when the books\npass from my guardianship, they will no doubt be preserved for future\nreference.\nI think, however, that no one who admits that automatic writing is\npossible at all, is likely to feel much doubt that we have here a genuine\nand typical instance of automatic script, written under some such\nconditions as those described above. It seems plain, moreover, that\nthe various entries were made at or about the dates to which they are\nascribed. They contain constant references to the s\u00e9ances which went\non concurrently, and whose dates are independently known ; and in\nthe later books, records of some of these s\u00e9ances are interspersed in\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. on\ntheir due places amongst other matter. The M.S.S. contain also a\nnumber of allusions to other contemporaneous facts, many of which\nare independently known to myself.\nI think,moreover, that on one who had studied these entries through\nout would doubt the originally private and intimate character of many\nof them. The tone of the spirits towards Mr. Moses himself is habitually\ncourteous and respectful. But occasionally they have some criticism\nwhich pierces to the quick, and which goes far to explain to me Mr.\nMoses' unwillingness to have the books fully inspected during his\nlifetime. He did, no doubt, contemplate their being at least read by\nfriends after his death ; and there are indications that there may have\nbeen a still more private book, now doubtless destroyed, to which\nmessages of an intimate character were sometimes consigned.\nThe questions at issue, in short, as to these messages, refer not so\nmuch to their genuineness as to their authenticity, in the proper sense\nof those words. That they were written down in good faith by\nMr. Moses as proceeding from the personages whose names are signed\nto them, there can be little doubt. But as to whether they did really\nproceed from those personages or no there may in many cases be very\ngreat doubt ;\u2014a doubt which I, at least, shall be quite unable to\nremove. We must return to this problem later, when the principal\ncases have been laid before the reader in detail ; at present I will\nmerely suggest for his guidance that he will generally find the evidence\nfor identity much more satisfactory in the case of spirits recently\ndeparted, and more or less on the medium's own level, than in the case\nof spirits more exalted and remote.\nIn his little book on Spirit Identity (1879), Mr. Moses had collected\nsome of the most impressive of these cases of identity, and added some\ninteresting matter as to the subjective side of his experiences. The\nbook was never widely known ; and when the small edition was\nexhausted Mr. Moses postponed the re-publication, on the ground that\nthe book was imperfect, and that he had no time to improve it. I\nrepeatedly pressed him on the subject ; and when last we spoke of it\n(October 15th, 1886), he said that he would some time re-write the book,\nand would consult me as to further passages of M.S. to be published. The\nbook was never re-written ; but an essay called \" The Identity of Spirit,\"\nfound among Mr. Moses' papers, and apparently intended to be read to\nthe London Spiritualist Alliance, in some degree fulfils his expressed\nintention. I communicated this paper first to I.ight, the newspaper\nof which Mr. Moses was Editor until his death ; but 1 feel it right to\nreprint it here almost in extenso, as his last word on the subject of\nthese identifications. I have carefully compared it with the M.S.S. on\nwhich it rests, and have found it accurate. I have also discussed it\nwith Mrs. Speer, who helped Mr. Moses in its compilation and vouches\n\f70 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nfor facts of verification, &c., not recorded in the M.S. I add a few notes\nwhere I have been able to bring some independent corroboration.\nSection C.\u2014 Mr. Moses' paper on tlie Identity of Spirit.\n\"The evidence which has been given to me is best, perhaps, presented\nin this way.\n\" When I first became acquainted with the subject of Spiritualism, I\ncame into relations with a spirit who called himself ' Imperator.' Those\nwho are familiar with my book Spirit Teachings will remember what\ncare I took to make sure that I was not being befooled by any spirit. If\nthe precautions that I took strike anyone as insufficient, I should much like\nto know what, in the opinion of my critic, would be considered sufficient.\nFor in the affairs of daily life I am much less careful, aud I find usually that\npeople do not go about to deceive me. The longer I live the more I am\ndisposed to believe that the object of people on any moral plane, as a rule, La\nnot to take in other people\u2014exceptia excipiendis, as will occur to all. And\nso with this belief in my mind, and with these precautions that I made use\nof, I present the evidence that now follows.\n\"It was in August, 1872, that I first became acquainted with evidence\nof Spirit Identity. Dr. and Mrs. Speer and I were then sitting regularly\nalmost every evening. A friend of Mrs. Speer's, of whom I had never\nheard, came and wrote through my hand her name, 'A. P. Kirkland.'\nDr. Speer said, ' Is that our old friend ? ' Then I wrote. ' Yes. I came\nto tell you that I am happy, but I can't impress our friend to-night.' The\nhandwriting then changed, and there came communications from Mr.\nCallister (a friend of mine) ; and from my cousin, T.J.S. ; and from another\nspirit, which I do not think it of importance to mention here.\n\" With regard to these communications, they were distinct in style, and.\nit is of importance to notice that the handwriting of Miss Kirkland was\nvery similar to her own, which I had never seen, and that of Mr. Callister,\non being questioned as to his identity, recalled to my memory a fact which\nhad escaped it, and referred to a conversation, the last I had had with him\non earth. This I do not adduce as evidence of identity, nor do I withdraw\nit as such.\n\"This was on August 21st, 1872, and on September 4th in the same year\nthere came a little sister of Dr. Speer's, particulars respecting which case\nare printed in Spirit Identity, p. 59, as follows :\u2014\n\" ' I pass to a case in which a spirit who first manifested her presence ou\nSeptember 4th, 1872, has remained in permanent communication with us\never since. I note this case because we have the advantage of prolonged\nintercourse to aid us in forming an opinion as to identity, and because the\nspirit has not only given an unequivocal proof of her characteristic\nindividuality, but has evidenced her presence in various ways. This is a\nremarkable case, too, as tending to prove that life once given is In\ndestructible, and that the spirit which has once animated a human body,\nhowever brief its tenure, lives on with unimpaired identity.\n\" 'The spirit in question announced herself by raps, giving a message in\nFrench. She said she was a sister of Dr. Speer's, and had passed away at\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 71\nTours, an infant of seven months old. I had never heard her mentioned,\nand her brother liad forgotten her existence, for she lived and died before\nhis birth. Clairvoyants had always described a child as being in my\ncompany, and I had wondered at this, seeing that I had no trace of any such\nrelation or friend. Here was the explanation. From the time of her first\nappearance she had remained attached to the family, and her clear, joyous\nlittle rap, perfectly individual in its nature, is never failing evidence of her\npresence. It never varies, and we all know it at once as surely as we should\nknow the tone of a friend's voice. She gave particulars of herself, and\nalso her four names in full. One (Stanhope) was new to her brother, and\nhe verified it only by reference to another member of the family, (Mrs.\nDenis). Names, and dates, and facts were alike unknown to me. I was\nabsolutely ignorant of the fact of the existence of any such person.\n\"This little spirit has twice manifested her presence on the photographic\nplate. One of these cases was attested by direct writing, and both will be\nfound clearly detailed in the course of my researches, in tho chapter on\nSpirit Photography, published in Unman Nature, Vol. VIII., p. 3'J5. (See\nalso Spirit Identity, Appendix IV.)\n\"So here we have a presence that gives by raps a name unknown to\nany person present ; that name afterwards verified ; that appears on a\nphotographic plate with her mother, certain distinctive features in the\nfigure of the mother giving further evidence of the identity of the baby-\nfigure ; and lastly, an attestation from those whom we had learned to trust\nof the truth of it all. I lay stress on this case. Another case which I\nthink important is this.\n''0n an evening in the month of January, 1874, I repeatedly said to\nMrs. Speer, * Who is Emily C . '? Her name keeps sounding in my ear.'\nMrs. Speer replied that she did not know anyone of that name. ' Yes,' I\nsaid very emphatically, ' there is someone of that name passed over to the\nworld of spirit. ' She could give me no information, and I was disturbed,\nin the way in which I always am when such things take place. This is one\nof the many cases occurring about this time. When the evening paper\ncame in we looked (as we frequently did) at the obituary. I may say that\nour nunds were set on this subject of identity. At our daily sittings fact on\nfact was given to prove it and to remove any doubts. It became a regular\nthing for us to receive a message giving such facts as an obituary notice\nwould contain. We therefore looked for them, and we found an announce\nment of the death of 'Emily, widow of the late Captain C C .'\nOn a subsequent evening in the following year, the date of which I can\nproduce, but which I have not by me at the moment, she returned again.\nDr. Speer and I had gone out for a walk in the afternoon\u2014I was then\nstaying with him at Dudley Villa, Shanklin, Isle of Wight,\u2014 and at our\nseance in the evening came ' Emily C C\u2014\u2014.' I enquired what\nbrought her, and her answer was rapped out on the table, ' You passed my\ngrave.' Here I should explain that at this time I never went near a grave\nyard but I attracted some spirit, identified afterwards as one whose body\nlay there. I said, ' No, that is impossible ; we have been near no grave\nyard,' and Dr. Speer confirmed my impression. The communication, how\never, was persistent, and we agreed that we would take the same walk the\n\f72 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nnext day. We did so, and at a certain place I had an impulse to climb up\nand look over a wall, which quite shut out from the view of the ordinary\npasser-by what was behind it. I climbed up and looked over, and my eye\nfell at once on the grave of 'Emily C C .,' and on the dates and\nparticulars given to us, all exactly accurate.\n' ' Another instance similar in kind\u2014though this is of a personal fnend of\nMrs. Speer's\u2014is the case of Cecilia Feilden. (See Spirit Identity p. 58). We\nwere then at Shanklin, sitting regularly every evening, when on January 1st,\n1874, there came a fresh sound, a little ticking sound in the air, close to\nMrs. Speer. We enquired what it might represent, and were told that\nit indicated the presence of Cecilia Feilden, who had died 17 years ago.\nWe asked why she came, and were told that she had been attracted to her\nold friend, Mrs. Speer, through me, and in consequence of Dr. Speer's and\nmy presence at her grave at Bonchurch that afternoon. She answered\nmany questions, and finally rapped out, 'I must now depart. Adieu.'\nThis word Miss Feilden always used at the end of her letters. Mrs. Speer\ntells me that she seldom concluded a letter otherwise. I had never known\nher, or heard of her until Dr. Speer pointed out her grave. When we rose\nfrom the table we found that a piece of marked paper, which we had put\ndown under the table, had written upon it the words ' passed 17 years.'\n' ' Again, there is the case of Henry Spratley. We were then the same\ncircle, sitting in the same way, on January 2nd, 1874, and I can aver that\nnot one of us had ever heard of this person. He had lately departed\n(December, 1873), and it was alleged that he had been brought by the\ncontrolling spirit, 'Imperator,' for purposes of evidence, and in pursuance of\na plan intended to break down my persistent scepticism. We had from him\nmessages of the usual type, saying simply who he was, when he was born,\nand when he died. We found it difficult, I remember, to verify the facts,\nbut in the end Mrs. Speer succeeded in doing so by writing (1) to the Post\nOffice, making a general enquiry, to which no answer came ; (2) to the vicar\nof Maidenhead, with no reply (we afterwards discovered that he was on his\nholiday); (3) to the ' present occupant of Moor Cottage,' the address given\nto us by the spirit ; (4) to his nearest surviving representative, who wrote\nback with some surprise to say that all things were quite true. ' My father\nlived here till he died on December 24th. '\n\"Perhaps I may here mention a case in which I endeavoured to mislead\na communicating spirit, but without any success. If there be truth in\nthe allegations of the too-clever people that constitute the Society for\nPsychical Research, there should have been conveyed from my brain to that\nof the impersonal entity with which I communicated the falsity I had\nfabricated.1 There came a spirit who represented herself to be my grand\nmother. I remembered her well as a child, and being at this time perfectly\nfree from any abnormal influence, I cross-questioned my alleged relative\nat great length. The answers to my questions were given by raps, different\nfrom any we had heard before, and during the greater part of the time\nwithout any contact with the table.\n\" ' I enquired of her minute facts and dates, her birthday, the day of\nher death, her children's names, and a variety of details such as occurred toi\n1 I do not accept, but need not refute, this criticism.\u2014F.W.H.M.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Staintvn Moee*. 73\nme. I then asked if she remembered me as a child. She did. I proceeded\nto detail two imaginary incidents such as might occur in a child's life. I did\nit so naturally that my friends were completely deceived. It never occurred\nto them that I was making up a story as a test. Not so, however, my\n' Intelligent Operator at the other end of the line.' She refused altogether\nto assent to my story. She stopped me by a simple remark that she re\nmembered nothing of the sort. Nor could I by any means get her to\nwaver, or to admit that she might be mistaken. She repeated that she\ndid not remember anything of the sort. I had frequently been told that\nspirits would assent to anything ; and my pious fraud had as much fur its\nobject to test the allegation generally as to prove identity in this particular\ncase. . . . This spirit, at any rate, refused to assent to what I\nsuggested. I certainly rose from the table convinced that I had been talk\ning to a person that desired to tell the truth, and that was extremely careful\nto be exact in statement. I verified all the facts, and found them exactly\ngiven. (See Spirit Identity, p. 53.) '\n\"I remember well that my mother was much surprised at what she\nthought to be the tenacity of my memory as to long past events.\n\"This narrative is becoming monotonous, but it is necessary for purposes\nof argument to bring facts to bear on you as they were brought to bear on\nme, if only for the same purpose. On January 4th, 1874, we had one of our\nusual meetings. Bright masses of light stood between Mrs. Speer and myself,\nand there came a gentle rapping directly under my hands. She asked if the\nspirit wished to communicate, and to her great astonishment the name\n'George Eves ' was rapped out. Greatly affected, Mrs. Speer said, ' Are you\ntny brother 1 ' ' Yes. ' ' Have you ever manifested your presence before ? '\n(This not from uncertainty as to the likeness, but because we wished to\nascertain in this way whether it was indeed George Eves whom we had\nseen and whom his sister had recognised.) 1 Yes, I have, but not here ;\npartly through, the medium you visited' (i.e., Holmes). 'Then that was\nyour face that I saw ? ' said Mrs. Speer. ' Yes.' Dr. Speer then asked if he\nhid a sister with him. No reply, but a much deeper rap gave through the\nalphabet the name 'Augustus.' Mrs. Speer, who was always very im\npressionable and generally knew what was wanted, said, \" Are you my\nfather!' 'Yes.' 'And you manifested also at Holmes', did you not 1\n' Yes.' After some further conversation, there came a little tapping again\nunder Mrs. Speer's hands. It would be almost impossible to make clear the\nevident anxiety felt by the spirit to communicate. The quality of the raps\nrepresented exactly the inflections of an eager human voice. We called the\nalphabet, and ' Emma ' was rapped out. Mrs. Speer had a mother and\nsister of that name\u2014she enquired which. 'Sister.' ' And have you seen\nour brother William ? ' ' No.' Further conversation followed, and the only\nobject in referring to it is to point out that it is too silly to think that any\nbeing should elaborately imposo in this way upon people whose one and\nonly desire was to arrive at the truth. Nor could any of those present who\nfelt the atmosphere, and saw the light that surrounded us, assent to the\ndoctrine that we were the sport of devils. I never sat under better con\nditions, nor in a more harmonious state, and I rely on such sensations quite\nas much as I do on material tests.\n\f74 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\n\"Another case that I think important is recorded in my Spirit Identity,\npp. 65\u201466, as follows :\u2014\n\" ' One more case of extremely minute evidence given in detail through\nthe means of raps, and corroborated by automatic writing, must be given\nbefore I close. About the same time of which I have been speaking, the\nwhole of one of our s\u00e9ances, extending nearly to two hours, was taken up\nby the communication of a series of facts, names, dates, and minute par\nticulars from a spirit who was apparently able to reply to the most searching\nquestions. The day of his birth, particulars as to his family history, and\ndetails of his early life were given at my request. Then came a perfect\nautobiography, so far as salient facts were concerned, and embracing some\ntrivial particulars, which, however, fell into their place in the most natural\nway. All questions were answered without the faintest hesitation, and\nwith perfect clearness and precision. The particulars were taken down at\nthe time, and are in all respects, where verification is possible, exact and\naccurate. Even if this case stood alone in my experience, it is more difficult\nfor me to imagine that what was so laboriously and precisely given was the\nproduct of imposture, the fraud of a deceiving spirit, or the vagary of an\nerrant brain, than to believe, as I assuredly do, that the intelligent operator\nwas the man himself, with memory unimpaired and individuality un-\ndestroyed by the change which we call death. Resting, as it does, on the\nsame basis with other facts that I have detailed, and with many that I have\nnot, it presents one more link in the chain of evidence In addition to the\nlong series of facts thus communicated by means of raps, there stands in a\nbook which I used at this time for automatic writing, a short letter written\nautomatically by me in a peculiar archaic handwriting, phrased in a quaint\nold-fashioned spelling. It is signed with the name of the spirit in question,\nwho was a man of mark in the days of his life upon earth. I have since\nobtained a letter in his handwriting, an old yellow document, preserved on\naccount of the autograph. The handwriting in my book is a fair imitation\nof this, the signature is exact, and the piece of old-fashioned spelling occurs\nexactly as it does in my book. This, it was said, was purposely done as a\npoint of evidence.'\n\" So much for the quotation. What follows is from my private records.\nThis same Thomas Wilson came to our circle on January 25th, 1874, and\noccupied the whole of the evening in giving the most minute details with\nregard to himself and his people, through tilts, or rather levitations, of the\ntable. I got tired to death, but still he went on. He said that he was born\nat Burton, in Cheshire, on December 20th, 1663, and that he died on March\n7th, 1755, aged 91. That his mother's name was Sherlock, and that she\nwas born at Orton, in Cheshire. That his schoolmaster was Mr. Harper, of\nChester. That he was ordained by Dr. Morton, Bishop of Kildare, to a\ncuracy of his uncle's, Dr. Sherlock, in 1686. That on January 29th (St.\nPeter's Day), he was made Bishop of Sodor and Man ; that he married Mary\nPatten, of Warrington, in 1698, and had four children\u2014Mary, died aged 13 ;\nThomas, aged one year ; Alice, aged 2 years, and another son, Thomas, who\noutlived him. He told us that ' Imperator ' had sent him to the circle.\nHis rap was clear and distinct. All these details were quite unknown to\nthe circle, but were verified afterwards, and an old letter sent by a friend to\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 7.'.\nme verified the handwriting. The word ' friend ' in it is spelt witli the e llefore\nthe i, as in the automatic writing. ... I ask, if he were not the man he\npretended to be, who was he ? For it is more difficult to conceive that any\nbeing could counterfeit the Intelligence represented than to believe that the\nIntelligence itself was present.\"\u2014[Note A.]\n\"Another account to which I should like to refer is that of Rosamira\nLancaster :\u2014\n\" 'On February 28th, 1874, and following evening, a spirit came by raps,\nand gave the name of \"Rosamira.\" She said that she died at Torquay on\nJanuary 10th, 1874, and that she had lived at Kilburn. She stated that her\nhusband's name was \"Lancaster.\" At this time I was troubled about details,\nand so I asked her husband's Christian name, and I got \" Ben,\" and then the\npower failed. (The obituary showed that the full name was Benjamin.)\nI then passed under the control of \" Imperator,\" and he said that he had\ntried as far as he could til bring this spirit to us. Afterwards the truth of\nthe statements was verified by me, and they were found to be absolutely\nexact ; and it is, perhaps, important to say in this connexion that not only\nwere they (i.e., the facts) literally true, but that nothing was said that was\nnot true ; nor was there any surplusage of detail\u2014only plain, definite,\npositive facts.' \"\u2014[Note B.]\n\"On the principle of driving the nail home, I will now give the case of\nHenry Le Mesurier. I had been a pupil of his at Bedford School, and on\nJune 17th, 1874, there came a new rap on the table. On enquiry the name\nof ' Le Mesurier ' was given. At that time I was entranced, and, therefore,\nincapable of asking questions. Mrs. Speer enquired what the spirit\nwanted. ' I have proved,' he said, ' that you were right, and that I was\nwrong.'\u2014[Note C] On what ground is it conceivable that a spirit should\ncome back and tell that lie 1\nAnd here I may refer to an account that has already appeared in print\nin Spirit Identity, pp. 61-63, as follows :\u2014\n\"On February 10th; 1874, we were attracted by a new and peculiar\ntriple tap on the table, and received a long and most circumstantial account\nof the death, age (even to the month), and full names (in two cases four,\nand in the other three, in number) of three little ones, children of\none father, who had been torn from him at one fell swoop by the Angel\nof Death. None of us had ever heard the names, which were peculiar.\nThey had passed away in a far distant country, India ; and when the message\nwas given us there was no apparent point of connexion with us. [See above,\np. 39.] The statements, however, were afterwards verified in a singular\nmanner. On March 28th, 1874, 1 met, for the first time, Mr. and Mrs. A. A.\nWatts, at the house of Mr. Cowper Temple, M.P. (afterwards Lord Mount-\nTemple). Our conversation was concerned, chiefly, with evidence of the\nkind that I am now summarising. I recounted various cases, and among\nothers, the case of these three children. Mrs. Watts was much struck with\nthe recital, which corresponded in outline to a very distressing history which\nshe had just heard. On the Monday previous Mr. and Mrs. Watts had\ndined with an old friend, Mrs. Leaf, and from her had heard a distressing\nstory of bereavement which had befallen the relative of one of Mrs. Leaf's\nacquaintances. A gentleman residing in India had, within a brief space of\n\f76 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\ntime, lost his young wife and three children. Mrs. Leaf entered fully into\nthe melancholy details, but did not mention either names or the place of the\nsad occurrence. In reciting the incident of three young children com\nmunicating with me, I gave the names and the place, as they had been\nfurnished to me in the messages. Mrs. Watts undertook to ascertain from\nMrs. Leaf the particulars of the case she had mentioned. She did so on the\nvery next day, and the names were the same. Through the kindness of\nMrs. Watts I made the acquaintance of Mrs. Leaf, and was much impressed\nwith the perfect correspondence of every detail given to me with the facts as\nthey occurred.\n\"It is not a little remarkable that, on the very day on which the\ncommunication was made, Mrs. Watts, who possesses a very beautiful gift of\nautomatic drawing, which had been for some time in abeyance, was impelled\nto draw three cherub heads, which, she was afterwards spiritually informed,\nwere drawn in typical allusion to this sad event. Other details, symbolic of\nthe country in which it occurred, and of the attraction of the mother's spirit\nto her three little ones, were added. The drawing forms a very striking\nillustration of the various methods employed to reach various types of mind.\nMrs. Watts\u2014at that time, be it noted, unknown to me\u2014had always been\ninstructed in the language of symbolism, by poetic simile, and by artistic\nrepresentation. I, on the contrary, had not progressed so far. I was on a\nmaterial plane, seeking for truth after my own fashion, and craving hard for\nlogical demonstration. So to me came hard facts, clearly given, and nothing\nmore. To her came the symbolic indication, the artistic delineation, the\npoetry of the incident. The source, however, was one. It was the Spirit\nmanifesting Truth to us according to our several needs.\n\" I regard that case as one of the most complete and remarkable that have\never fallen within my knowledge. For not only was the information given\nto me absolutely true, complete, and definite\u2014-it seems to me that we cannot\nattach too much importance to definite evidence\u2014but the facts conveyed to\nme in my own way\u2014that is to say, in a very positive manner\u2014were\nconveyed to my friend in the way that reached her best, ideally, pictorially,\nand through the imagination. Now, I should like to say that anyone who\npostulates a deceptive and fraudulent spirit going about to deceive me\u2014I\npray you, for what purpose 1\u2014has to account for the fact that this most\ndeceptive spook has used two methods of deceiving two different people.\nTo me he must have told circumstantial lies ; for my friend he must have\nmade some extremely curious drawings. I present this case for observation\nbecause I think that if I were a being who wanted to deceive you, I should\nuse some more simple and less complex methods. In other words, I should\nappeal more directly to your intelligence.\"\u2014 [Note D.]\n\" Passing by much that I shall eventually lay before the public, I will\nnow quote the case given in Spirit Identity, p. 193 (Appendix III.), of a\n' Man Crushed by a Steam-roller,' as contributed by an eye-witness of the\nseance [F. W. Percival] to the Spiritualist of March 27th, 1874 [And\nsee p. 42 above] :\u2014\n'' 'On the evening of Saturday, February 21st, a few friends met together\nat the house of Mrs. Makdougall Gregory, 21, Green-street, Grosvenor-\nsquare, W. The party numbered six in all, and included the Baron Du\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\n\u2014\u2014\nPotet, and the gentleman to whose mediumship we are indebted for the\n\"Spirit Teachings \" which have appeared from time to time in your columns.\nThere was no intention of having a seance, and ordinary topics were the\nsubject of conversation, when suddenly, in the middle of dinner, this\ngentleman surprised us by saying that he felt a spirit standing near him\nbetween himself and the Baron (who sat on his right) ; whether good or bad\nhe could not tell, but the influence was by no means pleasant. The spirit\nwas also perceived by the Baron, to whom it conveyed the impression that it\nwas in a state of great distress, and that it was the spirit of a person then\nalive. Nothing more was said at the time, but the medium continued to\nfeel a disagreeable influence near him, and spoke of it to me when dinner\nwas over. As soon as we reached the drawing-room he was impelled to sit\ndown and write ; and when a pencil and paper had been brought, his hand\nwas moved backwards and forwards with great rapidity, and an object was\nroughly drawn on the paper which resembled a horse fastened to a kind of\ncart or truck. Several attempts were made to depict it more clearly, and\nthen the following sentences were written :\u2014\" I killed myself\u2014I killed my\nself to-day\u2014Baker-street \u2014medium passed.\" Here the writing became\nunintelligible, as the medium grew more and more agitated, until at length\nhe rose from his seat in a state of trance, and exclaimed in broken\nsentences : \" Yes, yes. Killed myself to-day, under a steam-roller. Yes,\nyes. Killed myself\u2014blood, blood, blood.\" The control then ceased, but\nthe medium felt the same unpleasant influence for some hours afterwards,\nand could not entirely shake it off for some days. In reference to the com\nmunication, I may state that, although the medium had passed through\nBaker-street in the afternoon, neither he nor anyone present was aware that\na man had committed suicide there in the morning by throwing himself\nunder a steam-roller. A brief notice of the occurrence appeared in the Pull\nHall Gazette in the evening but none of the party had seen that paper. It\nis worth remarking that on the front of the steam roller which was used in\nBaker-street a horse is represented in brass, and this, perhaps, may serve to\naccount for its appearance in the medium's drawing, where we should\ncertainly not expect to find it.\n\" ' Allow me, in conclusion, to point out a few of the inferences that may\nfairly be drawn from the facts I have stated by those willing to accept them\nas true. In the first place, they would seem to prove that no amount of\ninjury done to the body at the time of death incapacitates the spirit for\nimmediate action. In this case the unfortunate man was literally crushed to\npieces, and yet a few hours afterwards his spirit could communicate in\nwriting through the medium, and could also make use of his organs of\nspeech. In the next place, it would appear that a spirit just released from\nthe body carries with it something corporeal ; otherwise, it is difficult to\naccount for the Baron's impression that the spirit he perceived was that of a\nperson who was then living. Again, we may infer that spirits immediately\nafter death are able to recognise a medium through whom they can\ncommunicate. In the case before us it would appear that the spirit followed\nthe medium from Baker-street, and waited for an opportunity of making his\npresence known. And, lastly, I would add the remark that the man who\naccepts the facts I have stated, and seeks for a solution of the difficulties\n\f78 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nthat surround them, will look in vain for much assistance from psychic force\nor unconscious cerebration.' \"\u2014[Note E.]\n\"Again, there is the case of Charlotte Buckworth, printed in Spirit\nIdentity, p. 112, Appendix III. (See also Spirit Teachings, p. 287) :\u2014\n\" ' A spirit communicated by means of raps, giving particulars as to her\nlife, which were precise, and entirely unknown to any member of the circle.\nOn the day following I inquired respecting her, and an account was given to\nthe effect that her name, Charlotte Buckworth, was rightly given ; that she\nhad no special connexion with me or with my friends, but spoke as one who\nwas present. The fact that I had been on the previous day in company with\nfour persons, all more or less mediumistic, had prevented regular communica\ntions, and had introduced a disturbing element.\n\" ' It was said that Charlotte Buckworth, the spirit in question, had been\nsuddenly deprived of bodily existence in 1773, at a party of pleasure, at a\nfriend's house in Jermyn-street. Further enquiry elicited the information\nthat she had suffered from a weak heart, and had dropped down dead while\ndancing. My friend, who was writing, could not say whose house, but\nsubsequently returned to give me the information\u2014Dr. Baker's, on\nDecember 5th. We were not able to verify this information, and had given\nno further thought to the matter. Some considerable time after, however,\nDr. Speer had a friend at his house, who was very fond of rummaging\namong old books. We three were talking one evening in a room in which\nthere were a number of books rarely used, arranged in shelves from floor to\nceiling.\n\" ' Mr. A. (as I will call him) mounted a chair to get at the topmost shelf,\nwhich was filled with volumes of the Annual Register. He took one down\namid a cloud of dust, and commented on the publication as a valuable\nrecord of events. Almost anything, he said, could be found in it. As he\nsaid this the idea flashed into my mind at once most vividly that there was\nthe place to look for a record of Charlotte Buckworth's death. The event\nwould probably create interest, and so would be found in the obituary which\neach volume contains. The impression was so strong\u2014it seemed as though\na voice spoke to my inner sense\u2014that I hunted out the volume for 1773, and\nthere I found, among the notable deaths, a record of this occurrence, which\nhad made a sensation as occurring at an entertainment at a fashionable\nhouse, and with awful suddenness. The facts were exactly given. The\nbook was thickly covered with dust, and had evidently not been disturbed\nsince it had been consigned to the shelf. I remembered that the books had\nbeen arranged five years before ; there they had lain ever since, and but for\nMr. A.'s antiquarian tastes no one would have meddled with them. The\nverification was, I believe, as distinctly spiritual in its suggestion as was the\ncommunication.'\n\"Perhaps one of the most striking cases I can present is the first\nexperience that occurred to me. (See Spirit Identity, pp. 124\u201412C,\nAppendix V.) :\u2014\n. . . \" I inquired where I could see for myself these new phenomena,\nand was informed that Miss Lottie Fowler [a well-known professional\nmedium.] was about to hold a seance that very evening (April 2nd, 1872), at\n15, Southampton-row. I went, and was greatly astonished at what I saw\n\fThe Experiences of IF. Stainton Moses. 7!)\nand heard. I need not take up time |ly detailing the occurrences of the\nfirst part of the sitting ; most Spiritualists are familiar with the usual\nroutine of Miss Fowler's seances. Much hazy nonsense was talked, and\nmany vague statements made, which seemed to me to be of no use what\never as tests of spirit identity. I was rapidly becoming nauseated. I\ncraved fur something more clear, somethmg on which I could rest as a\nstaple piece of evidence. I enquired, therefore, whether I might endeavour\nto obtain some such proof for myself. Leave was at once given by the\ndirector of the circle, and I addressed the spirit who controlled the medium.\n\" ' You are tiring your medium, and making fun of us. Go and send\nsomeone who is serious.\"\n\"The medium shivered and turned away, and the voice came as though\ntroubled.\n\" 'You've nothing to do with me. I won't go. Me no go.'\n\" ' Yes, you will. You'll go and send some one else.'\n\"After more colloquy the medium shivered again, seemed to bo in pain,\nand stood rooted to the spot, crouching as if in dread.\n\" After a time the voice came again, but utterly changed ; the voice, this\ntime, of a man, very calm and unimpassioned, instead of the child-voice\nspeaking baby jargon.\n\" ' You want me ? '\n\" ' Yes. What is your name ? '\n\" ' I'd rather not tell you. You can ask me any questions.'\n\" 'No. Tell me what you see, or describe any one whom you see near\nme. I will answer yes or no ; no more. '\n\" ' I see a man, very old, tall, with a long white beard, and long hair.'\n\"'Yes.'\n\" 'The beard is very white indeed.'\n\"'No. Goon.'\n\"'He has a very high, broad forehead, and his eyes are drawn down.\nWhy, he's blind ! '\n\"'Yes.'\n\" ' And his face is black and blue. And ' (here the medium shuddered\nviolently)\u2014' oh ! what's that in his mouth ? It's like slime\u2014and mud\u2014and\noh ! blood.'\n\"'Yes?'\n\" ' And\u2014it's dark. I can't see.'\n\" ' Go on. How is he dressed ? '\n\" ' He has a long blue coat. No, not exactly a coat\u2014something long. I\ncan't see his feet. '\n\" ' Where does he stand ? '\n\" ' Right opposite ; close by you.'\n\" ' Can you see his name 1 '\n'\"No. He seems in trouble. I think it's money. He looks so horrible.\nLet me go. Why do you keep me here.'\n\" ' Go, then. Do you know me ? '\n\"'No.' (This very emphatically.)\n\"I shall not attempt to describe the scene during the time that this\nconversation was held. I have quoted from a full and careful record written\n\f80 The Experiences of W. Stainton Hoses.\nat the time, and the whole scene is photographed indelibly on my mind.\nEvery one seemed petrified and astonished. They would have been still\nmore so had they known with what photographic accuracy a scene in my\nown private experience was being re-enacted before my eyes. It was, I am\nsure, as unknown as I was myself. It was a scene that passed in a very\ndistant part of Great Britain, and it was reproduced with a realistic power\nthat bore down before it, as with torrent force, all doubt and hesitation. I\nfelt that the man was there before me ; himself reproducing the story of his-\ndeath for my conviction.\n' ' Here we have the case of a man who went to a seance with absolutely\nno expectations in his mind ; he did not know what to expect ; he did not\nexpect anything ; and he got what in any police-court would be considered\nperfect evidence of life beyond the grave.\n\" There is another case, a very remarkable one, which came through my\nown automatic writing ; and in case people should assert that these things\nare borne in upon my mind by the persons with whom I may be associated,\nI may remark that this experience came when I was alone. It is prefaced\nby a facsimile signature. The lady, Mrs. Dalton, stated that she died at\nPeachley, having lived at Cheltenham most of her life. In answer to the\nquestion where Peachley was, she said that it was near to Bournemouth.\nShe oddly described herself as the wife of a brother of Dr. Speer's, and.\nwhen I thought that this would not do she explained that it was a ' brother\nin the art of healing.' She gave her husband's name as W. Dalton\u2014since\nverified\u2014and said that she died on February 2nd, 1872. The ' 2 \" was so\nbadly made that I enquired, ' 72 or '73? ' The reply was '72,' which was\naccurate. We were also told that this was one of the cases in which the\ncontrolling spirit brought persons for the sake of giving proof of identity.\n\" Again, Mary Hall came on March 29th, 1874, and wrote in a curious,\nshaky hand automatically : ' I have been with you and have watched you.\u2014\nMary Hall. ' I could make nothing of the signature, and, therefore, could\nnot possibly identify the individual in question. ' Mary ' being so badly\nwritten, I inquired if it were not ' Alice.' Then the signature came in\nvaried form, and I made out 'Mary Hall.' I said: ' I don't know you ;\nwhat brings you ? ' The answer, more carefully written, began : ' I am\npermitted to manifest,' and then the power being so weak, no more was\nwritten for a moment. I said, being occupied with a desire for identity :\n' Where did you live and die ? ' 'I lived near you, at Oxford Villa,\nAlexandra-road. I paased December 13th, 1872.' I said : ' I am afraid I\ncan't read it ' (the writing being such that it was now extremely hard to\ndecipher it). On this the writing changed, and there came a friend who\nusually controls when any one finds it difficult to do so. He said : ' She\nsays truly ; she passed near here, and is attracted to you from the neigh\nbourhood to the circle. She passed at the age of 91, and has been resting\nfrom her earthly toils.' Somewhat surprised, I enquired: 'Has she been\nsleeping all this time ? ' for I did not remember that in the spirit-world there\nis no time. ' Yes,' the answer came, ' she was full of years when she passed\naway. She lived most of her earth-life at Yarnton, near Oxford. She\nhas rested one year and three months of your time ; she rested from\nsuffering. '\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. SI\n\"This being was absolutely and wholly unknown to me. I enquired,\nand found that Mrs. Hall had lived and died, at the age stated, at the\naddress given.\n\"1 find it hard to put together all the evidence I have which makes me\nbelieve in the return of departed human beings to this life. If they\ncontinue to live, I should expect them to continue to return\u2014for that which\nmakes the reality of a spirit would almost certainly bring him back to the\nsphere of his interests. I do not understand a spirit going to the planet\nMars, where he has no ties, but I do understand his coming back here.\n\"Out of a profusion of cases here is one of a different kind. In the year\n1880, one Thursday afternoon (date unknown), Dr. and Mrs. Speer and I\nhad dined together, and the party included a lady who had been visiting a\nconnexion of Dr. Speer's family in that spring. There she had seen, and\nbeen much attracted to, a lovely little girl about seven months old. The child\nused to be brought in after dinner, and the lady in question grew very fond\nof her. Between the time of leaving her friends and coming to London, the\nchild passed away. It is important to notice that none of these points had\nhad ever been mentioned to, or were known by, myself. On the occasion\nto which I refer, this lady had risen from her seat and was about to place\nherself in another chair, when I suddenly called out, ' Don't sit down on it,\ndon't sit down on it. Little Baby Timmins.' None of us knew its first name,and\nthey asked me. I said, ' Marian ; the grandmother has brought it.' I then\nsuddenly came out of the trance in which I had been, and in my own natural\nvoice\u2014so different to the voice in which I had been speaking\u2014said, ' Mrs.\nSpeer, will you have some coffee ? ' quite ignorant of all that had been\npassed. We wrote, and then found out a fact unknown to any of us\u2014that\nthe child's name was Marian. I do not put this forth as a complete piece of\nevidence, for the lady may have heard and forgotten the name.\u2014[Note G.]\n\"Another case. There had come at one of our s\u00e9ances some influence\u2014I\nso call it for want of a better name\u2014which had made us all horribly cold.\nOn December 21st, 1874, I inquired about the s\u00e9ance of the previous\nevening, and was told that the coldness was caused by the presence of\ncertain spirits who had manifested without the knowledge of the Chief\n('Imperator '). I made enquiry with regard to certain statements made by\nthem, saying , ' Can you put the facts down, that I may compare them with\nwhat they said ? ' (It is important to say that I had no conscious memory\nof anything that had been said at that seance.) After my question there\nwas a very long pause, then :\u2014\n\" ' The mother was Euphemia Matilda Death, and she passed from your\nworld at Aldershot on November 20th at the age of 22. The little one was\nEdith Ellen Death ; she was only fifteen months when she passed away.\nHer father's name was William Death, Veterinary Surgeon of the Military\nTrain. These are the chief facts, we know no more.'\n\"These facts, utterly unknown to all the circle, were subsequently\nverified.\n\"As evidence from another point of view, I may mention that I have had\nrepeated cases of signatures which are veritable fac-similes of those used by\nthe persons in life ; such, for example, are the signatures of Beethoven,\nMozart, and of Swedenborg, in connexion with Judge Edmonds. It is\nI\n\f82 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nremarkable that his signature, or rather initials, in my book are those which\nhe used, and that Swedenborg's signature, a very peculiar one, is a\nfac-simile of his known handwriting ; quite unknown, however, to me.\"\u2014\n[Note H.]\n\"The case which has been considered, on the authority of persons who\nthink they are best able to judge, as the best evidence ever produced for\nspirit-identity is the case of Abraham Florentine recorded in Spirit Identity,\npp. 105-111, Appendix III. :\u2014\n\" CASE OF ABRAHAM FLORENTINE.\nTo the Editor of the Spiritualist.\nSir,\u2014In the Spiritualist of December 11th, 1874, you printed a letter\nfrom me, a letter the main portion of which, in view of the information\nelicited by it, I will ask you to reproduce.\nIn the month of August last I was staying with Dr. Speer at Shanklin,\nIsle of Wight. We had a number of sittings, and at one of them a spirit\ncommunicated, who gave his name as Abraham Florentine. He said that he\nhad been concerned in the war of 1812, and that he had lately entered\nspirit-life at Brooklyn, U.S.A., on August 5th, at the age of 83\nyears, 1 month, and seventeen days. We had some difficulty at first in\nmaking out whether the months and days referred to the age or to the\nlength of his illness ; but he returned on the following evening, and cleared\nup the difficulty. The manner in which the communication was made was\nmost singular. We were seated, three in number, round a heavy loo table,\nwhich two persons could move with difficulty. Instead of the raps to which\nwe are accustomed, the table commenced to tilt. So eager was the com\nmunicating spirit that the table rose some seconds before the required letter\nwas arrived at. In order to mark T it would rise, quivering with excite\nment, in a manner perfectly indescribable, about K, and then descend at\nT with a thump that shook the floor. This was repeated until the whole\nmessage was complete ; but so eager was the spirit and so impetuous in his\nreplies, that he bewildered Dr. and Mrs. Speer completely (I was in deep\ntrance) and caused the process to be prolonged over the whole sitting. If I\nmay venture a guess, I should say that Abraham Florentine was a good\nsoldier, a fighting man not nice to meet, and that he retains enough of his\nold impetuosity to rejoice at his liberation from the body, which (if I may\nguess again) had become a burden to him through a painful illness.\nWill the American papers copy, and enable me to verify my facts and\nRosses? M.A. (Oxon).\n\"Mr. Epes Sargent, to whom I privately communicated the facts of the\ncase, was kind enough to insert for me a paragraph in the Banner of Light\nof December 12th, 1874, embodying the same enquiry. The result was to\nelicit what the Banner calls ' one of the most singular and well-attested\nevidences of the return of spirit which it has been our good fortune to\nchronicle during a long experience. ' The matter may best be stated in the\nwords used by the writer in the Banner of Light of February 13th, 1875.\nIt will be observed that a misconception as to the meaning of the words,\n'a month and seventeen days,' occurs at first, but this is subsequently\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\ncleared up ; though, according to the widow's account, the age should have\nbeen eighty-three years, one month, twenty-seven days. This, however,\ndoes not affect the case of identity. The original enquiry in the Banner\nwas this, and the result is quoted direct from the newspaper :\u2014\n\" ' At -a seance in England lately, a spirit communication was received by\nmeans of the tilting of a heavy table. The whole table seemed alive, and\nas though it were being disintegrated in the very fibres of the wood. The\ngist of the communication was that the spirit was one Abraham Florentine,\nwho died at Brooklyn, N.Y., August 5th, 1874. Ho said he was in the war\nof 1812, and then, after an interval, added, \"a month and 17 days.\" Can\nany of our Brooklyn friends inform us whether they ever heard of Abraham\nFlorentine 1 '\n\" ' No sooner had that issue of our paper found its way to the public than\nwe received by due course of mail the following reply, which speaks for\nitself. :\u2014\n\" To the Editor of the ' Banner of Lioht.'\n\" In the ' Banner ' to-day received here is a paragraph concerning a\nspirit who manifested through the medium of a dining-table at some place\nin England, and gave the name Abraham Florentine, a soldier in the war of\n1812. You make enquiry whether anyone ever heard of Abraham\nFlorentine. I cannot specifically answer that question ; but having been\nengaged some 14 years since in auditing the claims of the soldiers of 1812\nin the State of New York, I am yet in possession of the records of all such\nwho made claims for service in that war. In those records appears the\nname of Abraham Florentine, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and a full record of his\nservice can be obtained in the office of the Adjutant General of the State of\nNew York, in claim No. 11,518, war of 1812. I think, however, that he\nclaimed for a longer term of service than that he gave in England, his\nallowance being 58 dol.\n\" Wilson Millar, Claim Agent.\n\"Washington D.C., December 13th, 1874.\n\" 'Pursuant to the advice of our legal correspondent, we addressed a\nletter to the Adjutant-General, S.N.Y. , asking for the facts, without,\nhowever, giving any reason for our request, and received the following\ncourteous reply :\u2014\n\"General Head-quarters, State of New York,\n\" Adjutant-General's Office, Albany, January 25th, 1875.\n\"Sirs,\u2014In reply to your communication, dated January 22nd, I have\nto furnish you the following information from the records of this office :\u2014\nAbraham Florentine, private in Captain Nicole's Company 1st Regiment\nNew York Militia, Colonel Dodge, volunteered at New York on or about\nSeptember 2nd, 1814 ; served three months, and was honourably discharged.\nHe received Land Warrant, No. 63,395, for 40 acres.

Stainton Moses.\n\" 'Those who are acquainted, through experience as investigators, with\nthe workings of the Spiritualistic circle will bear in mind that the correct\ngiving of dates is ever a matter of difficulty on the part of the returning\nintelligence, and, therefore, the slight discrepancy existing between the\nlength of service given by the spirit Florentine and that embodied in\nthe record is easily explainable. [This is a misconception. The one month,\nseventeen days, refers to age, not to length of service.\u2014W.S.M.] But\nthe main facts are established. Here is a spirit who manifests under the\nmost peculiar circumstances, and in the most forcible manner, to a circle in\na foreign land, whose members are all strangers to the fact that such a being\nas himself ever trod the planet; a member of the circle asks through an\nEnglish paper that proof (if any exists in America) may be given him as to\nthe verity of said spirit's assertions, and the same enquiry reaches us by a\nprivate letter; we then call upon the public for information concerning one\nof whom we have never before heard. We receive in reply\u2014from a legal\ngentleman in Washington, whose acquaintance we have never had the\npleasure of making\u2014the information which leads us to address the Adjutant\nGeneral of the State of New York (who is also a total stranger to us), and\nare assured from data existing at his office that such a soldier did serve\nin the war of 1812 as claimed. The theory of collusion is untenable here,\nas the several parties who have given in the testimony are strangers to\neach other. The chain of evidence is complete. Let those who think they\ncan explain this occurrence on any other hypothesis than that maintained\nby the Spiritual philosophy make the attempt. When that statement\nappeared, my friend, Dr. Crowell, was kind enough to take steps to obtain\nadditional verification from Florentine's widow. I append his letter\npublished in the \" Banner\" of February 20th, 1875:\u2014\n\"To the Editor of the 'Banner of Light.'\n\"Sir,\u2014Upon reading in the 'Banner' of the 13th inst. the article headed\n'Abraham Florentine: Verification of his Message,' I examined my 'Brook\nlyn Directory,' and there found the name of Abraham Florentine, with the\naddress 119, Kosciusko-street. Being at the moment disengaged, and in\nterested in pursuing the subject, I at once sought the street and number\nindicated, and my application at the door was met by an elderly lady, of\nwhom I inquired whether Mr. Abraham Florentine resided there. The\nreply was : ' He did reside here, but is dead now.' \"\nQ. May I inquire whether you are Mrs. Florentine, his widow ?\nA. I am.\n\" Upon my here remarking that I would be pleased to obtain some in\nformation about her late husband, she invited me to a seat in the parlour,\nand our conversation was then resumed.\nQ. May I ask when he died ?\nA. Last August.\nQ. At what time in the month 1\nA. On the 5th.\nQ. What was his age at time of decease 1\nA. Eighty-three.\nQ. Had he passed his eighty-third year ?\nA. Yes; his eighty-third birthday was on the previous 8th of June.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 85\nQ. Was he engaged in any war !\nA. Yes; in the war of 1812.\nQ. Was he naturally active and self-reliant, or the reverse ?\nA. He had a will of his own, and was rather impetuous.\nQ. Was his last illness of long or short duration, and did he suffer much I\nA. He was confined to his bed for a year or more, and suffered a good deal.\n' ' I have here given the questions and answers in their relative order and\nin their exact words from notes taken at the time. During a slight pause\nfollowing the last answer, Mrs. Florentine, who appeared to be a very\nrespectable lady of about sixty-five years of age and of American birth, in\nquired my object in asking these questions, when I read Ul her the article in\nthe 'Banner,' which evidently puzzled, though it interested her, and I then\nentered into a full explanation of its purport, greatly to her surprise. She\nthen fully endorsed every line of it, and I left, thanking her and promising,\nat her request, to send her a copy of the last number of your journal.\n\" It will be observed that while the spirit of Mr. Florentine states\nhis age to have been eighty-three years, one month, seventeen days, accord\ning to his widow's account it should be twenty-seven days; but this dis\ncrepancy is hardly worthy of notice, as either he or she may here be equally\nmistaken. As the case stood before this additional confirmation of its truth\nwas obtained, it certainly was a remarkable verification of a spirit message;\nbut as now presented it appears to me the evidence is conclusive.\n\"I would add that I have some acquaintance with ' M.A. (Oxon ),' the\ngentleman in London who applied in the SpiritiudM for information of\nAbraham Florentine ; and I can assure your readers that he occupies a very\nhigh literary position, and his character is a guarantee against collusion and\ndeception, and I take pleasure in contributing to establish the identity of\nthe communicating spirit.\n\" Yours truly,\n\"Eugene Crowell, M.D.\n\"Brooklyn, N.Y., February 15th, 1875.\"\n\"To me, personally, it is extremely interesting to find my queries\nverified by facts. I never doubted that the case would turn out, as so many\nothers have done, to be true; but the interesting point of observation to me\nwas as to the correctness of the deductions I drew from the singular way in\nwhich the communication was made. The vehemence of the tilts and\nknocks, the (to us) entirely novel mode of communicating, and the evident\nearnestness of the spirit, and its eagerness in trying to 'have its say,'\nwere very striking. Doubtless, what will strike your readers more is the\nsingularly conclusive nature of the evidence respecting the actual return of\nthe departed. Most undoubtedly none of us had ever heard of Abraham\nFlorentine, nor had any of us friends in America who could have given us\nnews of what went on there, nor, if we had, could they have mentioned to\nus a fact in which we should have felt no interest. As a plain matter of\ntruth, I repeat that both name and facts were entirely unknown to us. And\nthis is one among many instances in my own experience which I hope\nto gather up and record in its place.\n\"M.A. (Oxon.)\n\" March 10th, 1875.\n\f86 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\n\"In conclusion, I may remark that this case has received the valuable\nimprimatur of the Society for Psychical Research.\"\u2014[Note J.]\n\"One of the cases which are on quite a different plane of evidence I may\nrecord thus : on May 13th, 1876, Mr. C. C. Massey, Mr. H. J. Wood\nand I went to try for a spirit photograph at Hudson's. We had previously\ntried unsuccessfully, eight plates having been exposed in vain. On this\noccasion five failures succeeded one another; then came a plate which\nrepresented me sitting alone, and showing behind me a tall figure, that of a\nfriend whom I recognised at once. He had taken his life under melancholy\ncircumstances eight months before, and I had not heard of him since. But\nimmediately before going to Hudson's I had met and talked with his sister,\nwho was passing through London. Our conversation had been much con\ncerned with him. During the experiment I had heard a spirit-voice, telling\nme that it was successful, and also the name of the spirit whose image was\nto appear on the plate. There is a sequel to this story. The stigmatic\nmark on my brow, reproducing the cut on W. B.'s head made in his suicidal\nact, appeared on the anniversary of his death. (This I do not detail here.)\u2014\n[For this case see Section E.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\n\"But perhaps one of the most remarkable cases that I have ever had\nis that of the Bishop of Winchester (Wilberforce, previously Bishop of\nOxford), who first of all came to me when I was alone, and afterwards\ncontrolled me during one of our seances, speaking in a voice wholly unlike\nmine, and very like his own. He wrote through my hand, and signed his\ncommunication with the fac-simile of his own signature. Perhaps that\nis an elaborate mystification ? If it be so, it has at any rate the merit\nof being elaborate ! And I know nobody, or rather no spirit in or out of a\nbody, to whom it would be worth while to take such an amount of trouble\nwith such very unpromising results.\n\" I will now proceed to quote the case in fuller detail. On July 21st,\n1873, the Bishop of Winchester first came to our seances, although he had\nbeen to me when I was alone on the previous evening. On December 6th he\ncame again and controlled me, speaking in a voice which was very like his\nand unlike mine. In answer to a question as to who was controlling, the\nreply came, ' Samuel Wilberforce ; you have wished for evidence of the\ndeparted. I, Samuel Wilberforce, died. I have come back. I live, the\nsame man, the same spirit. It is strange, strange, very strange to come\nback again, and I find it difficult to speak. Another time it will be easier.'\nThe spirit then described his passage into life as instantaneous, without\npain ; a sudden waking into life. He said that with all his shortcomings,\nand they were many, he could still look back on his earth-life as a life\nof useful work, honestly done. He gave his blessing to the circle, and\nthen departed.\n\" On July 24th, 1873, the Bishop wrote through my hand automatically.\nHe was introduced by ' Imperator,' who said : ' A friend is with you who is\nable to communicate. You will know who has been near you.' My hand\nthen wrote \u201e , + g 0xQn .\nGod guard you, dear friend.\nIt is well\n+ S. O..\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. s7\n\" I said : ' How very extraordinary ! But how am I to know that it\nis . It is all so extraordinary. How did the same pen write this 1 It\ncertainly is the very fac-simile of his writing. Can it be possible that he is\nhere now ? Can he write again ? '\n\" ' No, friend,' replied ' Imperator,' ' he cannot remain, nor can he write\nagain now. He came at my request to give you a test. We wish to do\nwhat we can.'\n\"'But,' I said, 'this is no test. I am just as far from knowing his\nidentity as I am yours. '\n\" ' He reminds you of the last Sunday you spoke with him in Oxford ;\nhow he preached at the opening of the new organ for the praise of the\nSupreme at the Church of Carfax in the morning ; how he discoursed before\nthe University in the afternoon ; and how in the evening he gathered his\nwork-people round him at Cuddesdon, and spoke to them of the love of\ntheir God. '\n\" ' Yes,' I replied, ' and the last sermon -was far the best. Yes, that is\ntrue. Can you tell me the subjects of the other sermons ? ' \"\n\"'Yes, friend, the sermon before the University of Oxford was from\nthe words of John as touching the abiding Spirit. \" He dwelleth with you\nand shall be in you.\" xiv. 17. In the morning discourse the imperfect\nviews which the orthodox hold of heaven were developed from the picture\nof John the Seer, in the Apocalypse. \"They rest not day and night,\nsaving, Holy, Holy, Holy.\" Rev. iv. 8.'\n\" ' That is true ; but I do not remember the University sermon.'\n\" 'Friend, you heard it not, being overcome with sleep. But you have\nit among the published sermons of your friend ; p. 157 ; you will find it.'\n\" 'Yes, that is indeed true, and I remember it well. I was very sleepy,\nand the Bishop joked about it afterwards.'\n\" Then comes a further communication.\n'\"A friend will speak with you through us.' [Then in a handwriting\nresembling Bishop Wilberforce's.] 'S. O.\u2014Peace be with you. List and\nheed.'\n\" ' Our friend has not yet acquired the power of writing with ease. He\nhas not been able to return to earth since the day on which he wrote for\nyou. He came then at my request and by my aid. Now he tells you of his\nexperiences in our spirit land. Though the manner of the separation between\nthe spirit and body was rude and sudden, still the spirit woke to con\nsciousness far sooner than is usual. The spirit of our friend had lived\neven in earth-life much amid the realities of the hereafter. It had medi\ntated on its own translation, and had realised the change. So that when it\ncame it was less unexpected, even though sudden. He was wise therein.\nBut I will allow him to speak in his own words ' :\u2014\n\" ' When my spirit awoke to consciousness of the eternal life and its\nsurroundings, I found myself in company with bright and blessed angels,\nthe ministers to me of the abounding mercy of my God. The shock that\nsevered me from earth had been so sudden that at first I was not conscious\nthat I was in the world of spirits. But my dear father made himself known\nand convinced me that I was indeed alive and amongst the ranks of the\nshining ones. With him was my dear mother, and they were joined after by\n\f88 The Experiences of W.

I cannot reach them. They know not.\nand will not learn as yet. Since I left the earth I have been occupied\nin learning my work, and in preparing myself for the life of progress to\nwhich my being is now devoted. Already under the guidance of my\nguardians I have passed through the first sphere where are gathered those\nwho are bound to earth by the affections, or are unable to rise as yet.

I have verified these facts from Stowell's\n\" Life of Bishop Wilson,\" a book which Mr. Moses might perhaps have\nmet with in the Isle of Man. But the facts are scattered about and\ncould hardly have been picked up even by the subliminal memory\nwithout going through the book. The names of the two children who\ndied in infancy (called here Thomas and Alice) are not to be found\nin Stowell's Life; but I do not know how they could be verified.\nThis is, of course, a drawback to messages from historical personages.\n\fThe Experiences of W.

We have verified this death from\nan announcement in the Daily Telegraph, of January 15th, 1874, of\ncourse published long before the name was given by raps at the seance.\nIt is therefore quite possible that the name should have lx.en unwittingly\nseen by Mr. Moses, and here reproduced from his subliminal memory.\nIf the case stood alone it would be reasonable thus to explain it.\nWhere, however, as with Mr. Moses, there is much evidence to the\nidentity of returning spirits, which no subliminal memory would\nexplain, I think that that hypothesis need hardly be invoked even in\ncases where it might d la rigueur seem sufficient. See entry for\nFebruary 28th, 1874, in Section A.\nNote C.\u2014Henry Le Mesurier. Here, again, no facts were given\nwhich were previously unknown to Mr. Moses. The case, however, is\nmade more interesting by a fact not mentioned in Mr. Moses'\nsummary;\u2014viz., that this spirit had already made his presence known\nto Mr. Moses through automatic writing before he manifested during\nMr. Moses' trance in his seance-room. I give an extract from the diary\ndescribing this. The sentence, \" I have proved that you were right\nand I was wrong,\" refers to conversations with regard to man's sur\nvival of death.\nA. \"I see my mistake now, I hope to rest soon.

Reference to Mr.\nMoses' account will show that Mrs. Watts (deceased wife of Mr. Alaric\nA. Watts, Mr. Moses' executor) asked Mrs. Leaf (deceased aunt of my\ncolleague, Walter Leaf, Litt.D.) as to these Christian names, and\nMrs. Leaf seems at once to have replied. \"The names were the same,\"\nis Mr. Moses' comment. But how could Mrs. Leaf know 1 She was not\nlikely to have in her possession a baptismal register, or other full\nstatement of the elaborate Christian names of these three young\nchildren of \"the relative of an acquaintance.\" I can feel little doubt\nthat what Mrs. Leaf really possessed and showed to Mrs. Watts was\nan entry in the Pall Mall Gazette (seen also by us) of the death of the\nchildren, in which the initials of the Christian names were given,\ncorresponding to those of the names rapped out at the seance, to\nwhich entry Mr. Moses refers as verification. I suspected, there\nfore, that Mr. Moses' phrase was so far inaccurate that it assumed\nthat the whole names were the same because the initials were\nso. Personal reference to Mr. Watts and Mrs. Speer showed that\nthey had no distinct recollection which would conflict with this view.\nI therefore desired Mr. G. A. Smith to look up the matter, and his two\nmemoranda subjoined will show (1) that there was some little difficulty\nin getting at the information at all ; (2) that the information given at\nthe seance was probably more accurate than the official record.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 91\nJones Children.\n\"In May. 1893, we were informed at Somerset House that certificates of\ndeath of civilians in India were not kept there, and that application must be\nmade to the Deputy-Registrar in India. Application was therefore made to\nthis official, and after a delay of more than three mouths, during which time\nwe wrote a reminder, we were informed that fees for searches in the registers\nhad to be ' paid beforehand,' and a scale of charges was sent. The sum of\nfifteen shillings and postage was therefore mailed, and, in course of time,\nanother communication came to the effect that the registers for 1873 and\n1874 were in London, and could be inspected at the India Office, the fees\nbeing returned. Permission was at once obtained to inspect the registers at\nWhitehall ; and by the middle of December we were able, for the sum of\nthree shillings, to obtain the desired information.\"\nDecember 20(A, 1893.\n\" I have to-day made search through the Burial Certificates at the India\nOffice, Whitehall, taking the following notes about the Jones children.\n\"Bertie Henry D'Ogly Jones, died at Umballa, aged l\u00a3 years, on the\n31st December, 1873.

They knew that they had not got it all right,\nbut put down Cholmely.\nFor the benefit of foreign readers it must be said that the old\nEnglish name Cholmondeley is pronounced Chumley.\nIt seems to me obvious that in the official record aw has been\nsubstituted by error of copyist, who did not know the name Cholmon\ndeley, for on. And in the seance it seems as though they had got no\ntrror in any letter, but an omission, of ond and an e.\n(3) As between D'Ogly and D'Oly I have no evidence ; and I\nshould be glad either of a direct statement as to the child's name, or\nof such indirect evidence as may result from a proof that either name\n\f92 The Experiences of W.

Is the spirit unharmed by such a ghastly mutilation as that 1\nA. \" The mutilation of the body harms not the spirit.

Then that spirit haunted the place of its departure ?\nA. \" It is usually so that a spirit which has so rudely been severed from\nthe body would hover near even for a long time after.\"\nQ. How did it come to pitch on me 1\nA. \" You passed by, and being in a highly sensitive condition the\ndisturbed spirit would naturally be attracted to your sphere, even as iron is\nattracted to a powerful magnet. Moreover, when he came near he would be\nenabled to discern you by the aura which surrounds you and which is visible to\nthe spirit eye. Light and attraction would both enable him to recognise a\nchannel of communication which he longed for. You have been told before\nthat an aura surrounds all material objects, and that aura in the case of a\nmedium is recognisable afar off by spirit eyes.\"\nQ. Can you tell me what that aura is ?\nA. \"The magnetic aura which surrounds your body and enables spirits\nto gain access to you and to use the atmosphere for manifesting. It is more\nhighly charged with the force which we use and so is known to us. The\nmediumistic aura to spirit gaze is of golden hue. The sympathetic tint is\ncrimson, the colour of the affections\u2014the tint of the learned and powerful\nagent for the development of truth is blue, the colour of the intellect. The\nspirit who seeks for a medium is attracted by the mysterious force, to you\nmysterious, yet the force of sympathy which is all powerful with us.\n\"Attraction and repulsion, sympathy and antipathy, are known in a\ndegree to all, in the highest degree to the most sensitive.\n\" This is, as you know, the cause of the instantaneous feelings which dart\ninto the mind on another being brought into the reach of your aura. It\nexpands or contracts, attracts or repels, accordingly as it is in harmony or\ndiscord with the aura brought in contact with it. All spirits know this,\nthough all do not profoundly understand it. Some, as the suicide in\nquestion, would act by intuition and subject to magnetic attraction. Such\ngravitate to a sympathetic as iron to a magnet. Hence it is that the highly\ndeveloped are more open to attack from the grosser spirits.\"\nQ. Then to spirit eye, the aura declares the character ?\nA. \"To the more developed and progressed it does so, and hence the\nconcealment is not possible in our spheres. The spirit carries its character\nimpressed on the very atmosphere it breathes. This is a law of our being.\"\nQ. Very beautiful, but very awful !\nA. \" Nay, friend, not so : but a great safeguard, seeing that we know we\nare open to the gaze and the knowledge of all. It is well that it should be\nso. We pause.\"\nNote G.\u2014Baby Timmins. Mrs. Speer has described to me this,\nincident, which is remarkable as the only observed case where Mr.\nMoses had a sudden access of unconsciousness during ordinary life,\nalthough he himself mentions others.\nNote H.\u2014Euphemia Death. The seance at which this spirit\nappeared and at which Mr. Percival, Miss Percival (now Mrs. Garratt),\n\f94 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nand Miss Birkett were present, is described by Mrs. Garratt in a letter\nin my possession, and also, concordantly and at greater length, by\nMiss Birkett, whose account I have subjoined.\nDecember 21st, 1874.\n\"Exquisite scents of several kinds repeatedly brought round to each\nsitter. The fairy bells were heard clearly and beautifully ; and on Dr. Speer\nasking for scales, the ascending and descending scales were clearly played, also\narpeggio chords. The medium was controlled by various spirits, who\ndeclined to give their names ; and the whole of the manifestations during the\nevening were interrupted and broken up by the attempts to communicate of\ntwo spirits who gave the name of Death, but were unable to tell the\nparticulars they wished, until helped by Grocyn, who acted as interpreter,\nand repeated upon his lyre the facts he gained from them with difficulty.\nThe spirits said they had passed away within two or three weeks ; that they\nwere mother and child ; the mother's name, Euphemia Matilda Death,\naged 22, the child Ellen, aged 20 months ; that the death was sudden and\nunder painful circumstances ; that E. M. D. was the wife of a veterinary\nsurgeon at Aldershot ; and that she died on November 20th ; the child, it\nwas thought, on the 4th of November. The medium had previously\ndescribed the spirits, who stood close to him, as a young woman and young\nchild ; the latter standing, but supported by the mother. The medium\nseemed to suffer from their presence, and complained of their intense cold.\nImperator controlled for a few minutes, saying that in consequence of the\nanxiety to speak on the part of these young spirits he could not control the\nmedium, but would leave him, to allow them to make their communication.\nThat they came for help to get rid of the earth-influence which still clung to\nthem ; and that this process caused the feeling of cold to the medium and\ncircle. That it was easy to understand how good was obtained by the spirit\nin such a case, because of the sympathy existing between all living creatures,\nwhich bound all creation together. Regarding sudden death, Imperator also\nsaid that a suddenly painful and premature death caused much injury and\ndistress to the spirit. He wished it, however, to be understood that an\ninstantaneous death, when the spirit is ready and matured, is in no way dis\nadvantageous.\n' ' Later the same night the spirit of Euphemia M. Death returned to\nMr. Moses to correct some slight errors in her statement. The child's name\nwas Edith Ellen, and she was 15 months old. She died in great pain from\nan accident, and the mother died suddenly.\n\" After enquiry and search, a Woolwich paper was obtained, which con\nfirmed the foregoing statement in every particular, and added that the child\nEdith Death died from the effect of a fall into scalding water.\"\nMr. Moses had a further account of this visit, as follows :\u2014\nDecember 2nd, 1874.\nQ. I wish to ask about the s\u00e9ance last night. It was a very singular one\nas we were all so cold.\nA. \" The coldness was by the presence of the spirits who manifested.\nIt was done without the Chief's knowledge. We did not know that he would\nbe able to control, and the spirits were anxious.\"\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 95\nQ. Why did they come 1\nA. \"They were desirous and it was so planned.

' ' We can procure them if you wait. But we do not know.

Some thirty of these have been already mentioned by\nMr. Moses in the tractate just quoted ; but a few more cases remain\nwhich it seems desirable to print.\n31.\u2014The first case which I shall quote under this section is in\nsome ways the most remarkable of all, from the series of chances which\nhave been needful in order to establish its veracity. The spirit in\nquestion is that of a lady known to me, whom Mr. Moses had met, I\nbelieve, once only, and whom I shall call Blanche Abercromby. The\npublication of the true name was forbidden by the spirit herself, for a\nreason which was at once obvious to me when I read the case, but\nwhich was not, so far as I can tell, fully known to Mr. Moses. The\nlady's son, whom I have since consulted, supports the prohibition ; and\nI have consequently changed the name and omitted the dates.\nThis lady died on a Sunday afternoon, about twenty years ago, at\na country house about 200 miles from London. Her death, which was\nregarded as an event of public interest, was at once telegraphed to\nLondon, and appeared in Monday's Times ; but, of course, on Sunday\nevening no one in London, save the Press and perhaps the immediate\nfamily, was cognisant of the fact. It will be seen that on that evening,\nnear midnight, a communication, purporting to come from her,was made\nto Mr. Moses at his secluded lodgings in the north of London. The\nidentity was some days later corroborated by a few lines purporting to\ncome directly from her, and to be in her handwriting. There is no reason\nto suppose that Mr. Moses had ever seen this handwriting. His one\nknown meeting with this lady and her husband had been at a seance\u2014\nnot, of course, of his own\u2014where he had been offended by the strongly\nexpressed disbelief of the husband in the possibility of any such\nphenomena.\nOn receiving these messages Mr. Moses seems to have mentioned\nthem to no one, and simply gummed down the pages in his M.S. book,\nmarking the book outside \" Private Matter.\" The book when placed\nin my hands was still thus gummed down, although Mrs. Speer was\ncognisant of the communication. I opened the pages (as instructed by\nthe executors), and was surprised to find a brief letter which, though\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 07\ncontaining no definite facts, was entirely characteristic of the Blanche\nAbercromby whom I had known. But although I had received letters\nfrom her in life, I had no recollection of her handwriting. I happened\nto know a son of hers sufficiently well to be able to ask his aid\u2014aid\nwhich, I may add, he would have been most unlikely to afford to a\nstranger. He lent me a letter for comparison. The strong resem\nblance was at once obvious, but the A of the surname was made in\nthe letter in a way quite different from that adopted in the automatic\nscript. The son then allowed me to study a long series of letters,\nreaching down till almost the date of her death. From these it\nappeared that during the last year of her life she had taken to writing\nthe A (as her husband had always done) in the way in which it was\nwritten in the automatic script.\nThe resemblance of handwriting appeared both to the son and to\nmyself to be incontestable; but as we desired an experienced opinion he\nallowed me to submit the note-book and two letters to Dr. Hodgson.\nReaders of these Proceedings (Part IX., Vol. III.) may remember that\nDr. Hodgson succeeded in tracing the authorship of the \" Koot Hoomi \"\nletters to Madame. Blavatsky and to Damodar, by evidence based on a\nminute analysis of handwriting. As regards the present matter, Dr.\nHodgson reports as follows :\u2014\n5, Boylston Place,\nBoston, September 11<A, 1893.\n\"I have compared the writing numbered 123 in the note-book of Mr.\nStainton Moses, with epistles of January 4th, 18\u2014, and September 19th,\n18\u2014, written by B.A. The note-book writing bears many minor resem\nblances to that of the epistles, and there are also several minor differences\nin the formations of some of the letters, judging at least from the two\nepistles submitted to me ; but the resemblances are more characteristic than\nthe differences. In addition, there are several striking peculiarities common\nto the epistles and the note-book writing, which appear to be especially\nemphasised in the latter. The note-book writing suggests that its author\nwas attempting to reproduce the B.A. writing by recalling to memory its\nchief peculiarities, and not by copying from specimens of the B.A. writing.\nThe signature especially in the note-book writing is characteristically like\nan imitation from memory of B.A. 's signature. I have no doubt whatever\nthat the person who wrote the note-book writing intended to reproduce the\nwriting of B.A.\"\nRichard Hodgson.\nThe chances necessary to secure a verification of this case were more\ncomplex than can here be fully explained. This lady, who was quite\nalien to these researches, had been dead about twenty years when her\nposthumous letter was discovered in Mr. Moses' private note book by\none of the very few surviving persons who had both known her well\nenough to recognise the characteristic quality of the message, and were\n\f98 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nalso sufficiently interested in spirit identity to get the handwritings\ncompared and the case recorded.\nThe entries in the M.S. books will now be quoted. The communica\ntions began with some obscure drawings, apparently representing the\nflight of a bird.\nA. \" It is spirit who has but just quitted the body. Blanche Abercromby\nin the flesh.

How was it that spirit [Blanche Abercromby's] came to me ?\nA. \"The mind was directed to the subject, and being active, it projected\nitself to you. Moreover, we were glad to be able to afford you another\nproof of our desire to do what is in our power to bring home to you evidence\nof the truth of what we say.\"\nQ. Is it correct to say that the direction of thought causes the spirit to be\npresent ?\nA. \"In some cases it is so. Great activity of spirit, coupled with anxiety\nto discover truth an to seek into the hidden causes of things, continue to\nmake it possible for a spirit to manifest. Moreover, direction of thought\ngives what you would call direction or locality to the thought. By that we\nmean that the instinctive tendency of the desire or thought causes a\npossibility of objective manifestation. Then by the help of those who, like\nourselves, are skilled in managing the elements, manifestation becomes\npossible. This would not have been possible in this case, only that we took\nadvantage of what would have passed unnoticed in order to work out\nanother proof of the reality of our mission. It is necessary that there\nshould be a combination of circumstances before such a manifestation can be\npossible. And that combination is rare. Hence the infrequency of such\nevents, and the difficulty we have in arranging them : especially when\nanxiety enters into the matter, as in the case of a friend whose presence is\nearnestly desired. It might well be that so ready a proof as this might not\noccur again.\"\nQ. Then a combination of favourable circumstances aided you Will the\nspirit rest, or does it not require it ?\n\fThe Experiences of W.

You\nsaid once that conditions had been interfered with by the projection of\nantagonistic thought from a distance. And now it seems that a spirit\nreleased from its body is carried whither its thoughts turn. It seems then\nthat thought is motion : and that effect can lle produced without the actual\npresence, as we understand it, of a spirit in the room. If this be so, it\nseems to follow that manifestations may be performed objectively.or at least\ndirected, without the actual presence of the spirit who purports to make\nthem. Is this so ever and is this so in our own circle ?\nA. \" It is so frequently in this way. Great spirits operate through inferior\nagencies without themselves being present as you understand the term.\nThis is very frequent.\"\nA few days later, Mr. Moses says :\u2014\nQ. The spirit B.

I remember that poor man who was killed by the steam-roller drew.\nA. \" Do not dwell on him lest you be vexed. He was notable to oxpress\nhimself. And even as the undeveloped human mind betakes itself to\nsymbols to supplement defect of language : so do spirits seek to illustrate\nthat which they cannot utter. So the Holy Maid [of Kent] drew when\nshe appeared. She has now progressed, and is progressing, having cast\naside the weight that hindered her.\"\nQ. I am glad. Will she come back ?\nA. \" It may be, but not now.\"\n[A few days later.]\nA. \"A spirit who has before communicated will write for you herself.\nShe will then leave you, having given the evidence that is required.\"\n\"I should much like to speak more with you, but it is not permitted.\nYou have sacred truth.

Stainton Moses.\n32.\u2014Miss Green (Spirit Identity, pp. 90-91).\n' ' The first of my cases occurred on August 18th inst. I had returned\nfrom a three days' absence to the house of friends with whom I was staying.\nWhen I left, a friend of the lady of the house was unwell. During my\nabsence she died very suddenly. When I entered the room I saw her\nstanding beside her friend\u2014the lady whom I was visiting. The dis\nembodied phantom was as clear to my gaze as the living person to whom I\nwas talking. 'So Miss is dead,' I said, forgetting that the good lady\ncould not see the ghostly visitant. 'Yes.' ' And buried,' I continued, for\nthe words sounded in my ear. ' Yes ; but how did you know ? ' Then I\nremembered, and turned the subject, for my hostess would have fainted in\nhorror had she known how near to her her friend was. Strange ! a few\nhours ago and she would sit by the bedside and clasp the clammy hand, and\nkiss the lips on which death already had set the seal of silence : yet she\nwould have screamed at the friend whose self was by her, minus only that\nold and shabby body which it had cast off. That is what ' 1 believe in the\nresurrection of the body ' has brought us to. I took careful note of the\ndress, mien, and face of the ghost\u2014I had never seen the original in the\nbody\u2014and, as occasion served, I elicited from my hostess a description,\nwhich greatly tallied with my vision, except in one point. The ghost wore\na brooch of peculiar make, which I could get no description of. On the\nfollowing day, however, my hostess came back from her friend's house with\nthe identical ornament in her hand. Her friend had left it to her as a\nmemento.\"\nThe \" hostess \" here was Mrs. Moses, mother of W. S. M.

In Spirit Identity, pp. 94-5, Mr. Moses\nrelates how, when walking with a friend and discussing spiritualism, he\ntook refuge from rain in an inn, [the \" Britannia,\" Belsize Road, as he\ninformed me].\n\"One day we were walking together and rain came on. To avoid a\nwetting we took refuge in a billiard-room near at hand, and whiled away the\nrainy hour with a game, discussing all the while. The proprietor was the\nonly other person in the room, and he showed some interest in what I was\nsaying. He asked some questions, and seemed rather frightened than\notherwise. He was a wine merchant, and gave me his card as I left, asking\nfor custom. From time to time I did purchase some goods from him, anil\non perhaps half a dozen occasions exchanged some words with him. He\nalways asked me about Spiritualism. The last time I saw him he was ill,\nand said that he was in the doctor's hands, but was mending fast. I saw\nno more of him, until sitting alone, as my habit is, in my study in the\nearly morning, he appeared to my clairvoyant eye. I was writing about\ntranscorporeal action of spirit, the double, and such phenomena, and I\nwondered much at this apparition. I never thought for a moment that it\nwas anything but a double of the living man. For a time he could not\nspeak ; but when he managed to make me hear, he saluted me as he would\nhave done in the flesh, calling me Mr. , a name which he heard my\nfriend use while we were together in the billiard-room. It was a name used\nby him, and known, I am sure, to no one else except two or three\nacquaintances. Yet this spirit used it quite naturally, as he would have\ndone in the flesh, though he knew my real name well enough. I gradually\ninquired what brought him, and learned that he had ' come to see me.' He\nwas dead\u2014had died some two months ago at a place and address which he\ngave me. He likewise told me his full name, the disease which carried him\noff, and the date of his death. All these facts were entirely outside of my\nknowledge. He died at a watering-place far away. His full name, disease\n(a peculiar one), and death, were utterly unknown to me. I and some\nfriends verified them all, and found them literally exact. Yet he seemed to\nhave no special reason for coming, unless it was to add his stone to the\ncairn of evidence. He did not even say that he had discovered the truth of\nmy faith, and had come to confirm it. He came, and he went, and, like\nmany another who has done the same, I have seen him no more.\"\nMr. Moses told me that this Mr. Rowbotham died at Torquay, of\ndiabetes. I have not verified this decease, as the^year is not given.\n36.\u2014President Garfield. This is a communication made, not by the\ndeparted spirit itself, but by friends.\n30, St. Peter's, Bedford.\nSeptember 20th, 1881, 10 a.m.\u2014This morning, on awaking at 5.54 a.m.,\nI was aware of a spirit who desired to communicate. It turned out to be\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 103\nMentor, with him B. Franklin, [Epes] Sargent and others. They told me\niu effect \" The President is gone. We were with him to the last. He\ndied suddenly, and all our efforts to keep him were unavailing. We\nlaboured hard, for his life was of incalculable value to our country. He\nwould have done more to rescue it from shame than any one now left.\" I\nasked why it had been deemed necessary to come to me with the news. It\nwas replied that a period of great activity in the spirit world was now being\nrenewed, and that my sympathies with him and with his work, and their\nown knowledge of me, had inclined them to bring the news. The Daily\nSeics contained no tidings, though the bulletins were bad. It seemed on\nthe contrary that the news of the previous night which they contained was\n-a little more favourable. I walked down to the station fooling convinced\nthat the news would come, but up to 11.30 a.m. could not hear of it.\nAbout 12.37 I again went and found that a rumour had reached Bedford.\nThe evening papers\u2014Globe and Echo\u2014which I purchased at 4.30 p.m.\ngave me the first mundane information of the event. It is now stated that\nhe died at 10.50 p.m. on the 19th (yesterday). That in English time is\n3.50 a.m. of this day, 20th, or two hours before I woke and got the message.\nI have since learned that the death was sudden, and the remarkable\nfluctuations are not inconsistent with efforts such as described.\nSeptember 21st.\u2014The latest reports fix 10.35 not 10.50 p.m. [or 3.36\na. m. English time] as the exact time of death. I forgot to say that very\nstrong disapprobation was expressed of the administration of defiurinated\nbullock's blood which had been resorted to at the last. This seems to have\nbeen especially repulsive, as crude blood is apparently universally connected\nwith the lowest and most undeveloped form of spirit-life, for which it has a\ngreat attraction. A vessel of fresh blood was a means of ensuring the\npresence of powerful spirits at magical incantations and seances. In the\nseance recorded on p. 70 this was insisted on, a propos of the slaughter of a\nbullock which I had been led to witness. It was said that undeveloped\nspirits rejoiced in the bloodshed, and found their great attraction wherever\nit was to be found.\n37.\u2014Dr. Speer.\nDr. Speer died February 9th, 1889, and shortly after his death Mr.\nMoses received from him a remarkable proof of identity, of which he\nwrote me an account at the time. I much regret that I have mislaid\nthat letter; but Mrs. Speer has kindly written for me [1894] an, of course,\nindependent account, which I recognise as completely accordant with\nthat which Mr. Moses had given me. On receiving Mr. Moses' account,\nI wrote to him suggesting that the pet name might have been used by\nDr. Speer in speaking to his wife during one of Mr. Moses' trances, and\nmight thus have been subconsciously heard by Mr. Moses. He repudi\nated\u2014indeed almost resented\u2014this suggestion; and on talking to Mrs.\nSpeer, since Mr. Moses' death, I find her absolutely sure that the nursery\nnickname\u2014felt by herself to be absurd in its application to an elderly\nlady\u2014had never been used except in complete privacy.\n\f104 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\n\"The first time my husband made his presence felt to Mr. Moses was\nwhen he was writing about him for Light ; he mentions it in the account.\nSeveral other times he told me he had seen Dr. S. in vision, but he seemed\nunable to speak, and if he did Mr. M. forgot what he said, as was often the\ncase when he came out of the trance state. But I remember one incident\nwhich must have occurred soon after our loss, but I have not the date\nof it here. Mr. S. M. came one Sunday to dine with us. He looked\nstrange and remarked to me, ' I have seen your husband again, and he senc\nyou a message which I do not understand.' He seemed troubled, and I saw\nhe was unable to take any dinner. Suddenly he took out his pocket-book\nand rapidly wrote something in one of the sheets, tore it out and handed it\nto me saying, ' Can you make anything out of this ? ' I saw a message\nwritten ' Tell dearest all's well. ' The word omitted was a pet name\nhe often called me when alone. I think no one had ever heard it, and I am\nquite sure Mr. Moses never had. The name is too absurd to print, as pet\nnames often are. I took the paper from him and could not help smiling to\nsee the old familiar pet name again, and felt at once the message must have\ncome from my husband, and said to Mr. S. M. , ' Oh yes, that is the pet name\nStanhope usedto use when we were alone. I can show it to youin many letters.\"\nI went upstairs and brought several down, all commencing ' My dearest . '\nAs soon as I had shewn him the letter he looked greatly relieved and was\nable to enjoy his dinner. I think he must have feared he was being\ndeceived. We looked on it at the time as a good test, as I know he had.\nnever heard the name. My daughter perfectly remembers the incident and\nsays this account is correct.\"\nI have now quoted the best cases in Mr. Moses' records of\nidentification of a spirit recently departed. It is in these recent\ncases that the evidence is simplest and strongest ; and it will be\nobserved that they closely resemble similar proofs of identity given in\na long series through Mrs. Piper, and recorded in more sporadic fashion\nelsewhere. The communicating spirit seems to be little changed,\nand to retain its characteristic interest in survivors and in the things\nof earth.\nThere are also an alleged group of remoter spirits ; but it is\nobvious that the evidence to identity which they can give must\ngenerally be less direct and convincing. By the very conditions of\nthe communication they cannot show commanding intellect, or teach\nentirely new truths, since their manifestations are ex hypothesi bmited\nby the capacity\u2014not by the previous knowledge\u2014but by the previous.\ncapacity\u2014of the medium. And if they give facts not consciously-\nknown to the medium\u2014facts however elaborate\u2014it may still be\nsuggested that these facts have been subliminally acquired by the\nmedium through some unconscious passage of the eye over a printed\npage, or else that they are clairvoyantly learnt, without the agency of\nany but the medium's own mind, though acting in a supernormal\nfashion.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 105\nThis is no merely fanciful hypothesis ; nor is it a hypothesis\nderogatory to Mr. Moses' own probity. On the contrary, as will 1*e\npresently seen, he himself prominently puts forth the circumstance\n(Rector's copying from a closed book) which tells most strongly for\nthe view that the alleged remote identities may not really be concerned\nat all. Nay, the guides themselves expressly state\u2014d propoi of some\nbrief accounts of musicians said to be interested in Mr. Charlton\nSpeer\u2014that spirits can refer to books, e.g., their own biographies,\nand refresh, their memory thereby. This admission of course leaves us\nwith nothing more than the word of Imperator to prove that, say,\nRobert of Gloucester, or Geoffrey of Monmouth, (who merely give facts\nabout their own writings), were in reality present. Such guarantee\u2014\nsometimes only indirectly implied\u2014was enough for Mr. Moses at the\ntime ; especially since these remoter spirits came in intermixture with\nnearer spirits, whose identity could be better proved. But in a serious\ntalk with me on the matter in 1 886 he withdrew much of this certainty ;\n\u2014saying that in the case of some of the musical spirits especially\nhe had had no inward sensation of a spirit's presence,\u2014such as he had\nhad, for instance, in the cases of Miss Green and Mr. Rowbotham, given\nalxlve. He repudiated, however, the idea of subconscious memory on\nhis part of words actually seen by himself ; feeling sure that some of\nthe facts automatically written had never been beneath his eyes. This\nmay very well be the case; as he had not, I think, more than a mere\nschoolmaster's acquaintance with English literature and history ; not,\nindeed, so much as would nowadays be expected from an English master\nin a school as good as that where he held a post. I judge this largely\nfrom the \" Notes by the Way,\" which he contributed to Light for many\nyears: and in which he was certainly not minimising his actual store of\nknowledge. But be this as it may, I cannot find in these historical com\nmunications any provable fact which might not have been drawn from\nsome fairly accessible printed source. There were certain stanzas from\nLydgate, written by the alleged Zachary Gray, [or Grey,] which Mr.\nPercival verified in the British Museum. But these are to be found in\nWarton's Etvjlish Poetry ; from which they reproduce (as Prof. Skeat\nhas kindly pointed out to me) a philological error of Warton's own. It\nwill be seen below that the power of reading closed books is expressly\nattributed to Zachary Grey ; and if he really possessed it he probably\nexercised it here ; giving thereby, of course, no particular proof that he\nwas Zachary Grey rather than any other spirit. On the other hand,\nthe Holy Maid of Kent makes a statement which, although directly\ncontradicted by Froude in his History, is almost certainly true. She\nsays that she was led by \" torture \" to make her\u2014as she claims untrue\n\u2014confession ; and although Froude says that she was not tortured, it\nseems plain that she received treatment in prison which led her in a\n\f106 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nfew days' space absolutely to change her tone, and give in to her\naccusers. \" Torture\" is not a legal term ; but without any published\ncontemporary order on the matter there might have been, and pro\nbably was, a very sufficient reality. This point also, making, so far\nas it goes, in favour of the identity, passed unobserved at the time.\nI will now give the account of Rector\u2014one of the alleged remoter\nspirits\u2014as to a quotation from a closed and unknown book.\n38.\u2014Rector. This spirit is very intimately associated with Mr.\nMoses, and habitually writes for Imperator, and for the group of\nguides generally. His handwriting comes more and more to resemble\nthat of Mr. Moses himself.

Can you read ?\nA. \"No, friend, I cannot, but Zachary Gray can, and Rector. I am\nnot able to materialise myself, or to command the elements.\"\nQ.

Can you go to the book-case,\ntake the last book but one on the second shelf, and read me the last\nparagraph of the ninety-fourth page ? I have not seen it, and do not even\nknow its name.\nA. \"I will curtly prove by a short historical narrative, that popery is a\nnovelty, and has gradually arisen or grown up since the primitive and pure\ntime of Christianity, not only since the apostolic age, but even since the\nlamentable union of kirk and the state by Constantine.\"\n[The book on examination proved to be a queer one called Roger's\n\" Antipopopriestian, an attempt to liberate and purify Christianity from\nPopery, Politikirkality and Priestrule.\" The extract given above waa\naccurate, but the word \" narrative \" substituted for \"account.\"]\nQ. How came I to pitch upon so appropriate a sentence 1\nA. \"I know not, my friend. It was by coincidence. The word was\nchanged by error. I knew it when it was done, but would not change.\"\nQ. How do you read ? You wrote more slowly, and by fits and starts.\nA. \"I wrote what I remembered, and then I went for more. It is a\nspecial effort to read, and useful only as a test.

Amen.\"\n[The book opened at page 145, and there was the quotation perfectly\ntrue. I had not seen the book before : certainly had no idea of its\ncontents.] [These books were in Dr. Speer's library.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nIt is plain that a power such as this of acquiring and reproducing\nfresh knowledge interposes much difficulty in the way of identifying any\nalleged spirit by means of his knowledge of the facts of his earth-life.\nThe spirit \" Imperator \" claims responsibility for the whole series\nof manifestations and should therefore be mentioned here, although\nthere is no proof of his identity with the historical personage whom\nhe asserts himself to be. His character, however, claimed and obtained\nMr. Moses' entire confidence. He answers for the identity and\nveracity of spirits introduced ; he explains the phenomena, so far as\nthey are explained ; and he throughout impresses on Mr. Moses his\nown teaching.\nIf such high and sweeping claims were made by any ordinary\nwriter, we should expect to find much in the course of his writings\nwhich would prove their extravagance. If we ask ourselves how to\ndisprove Imperator's claims we shall find no very definite answer. We\nmay indeed suggest that he seems to have reposed more confidence in\nthe spirits styling themselves Magus than they altogether deserved.\nAnd of course we shall say, with varying degrees of emphasis, that the\nteaching which he offers as the highest boon, and which Mr. Moses\naccepts as such, is by no means so novel or so illuminating as is some\ntimes implied. But this is only to say that Imperator is not our\nappointed guide ; that it is not we who are directly reached by his\nexhortation or argument. His utterances, like other human utterances,\nfall short of the universality, the permanence, which their author would\nfain give them. But in regard to their primary end, the develop\nment of Mr. Moses' own soul, I know not if words of more weight\ncould have been spoken, or that sturdy and downright spirit led\nonwards by any surer way.\nWe have now briefly surveyed the principal members of the\nnumerous group of spirits alleged to have communicated with Mr.\nMoses in various ways. The facts relating to them have been of a\ncomplex kind, and it will be convenient here to discuss some of the\nQuestions which they suggest.\n1. In the first place let us review the group of communicating\n.\"^ptfits as a whole, and see if we can form any conclusion as to the\n\f108 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nreason why certain spirits, and not others, desired or were able to\nindicate their presence.\n2. Next let us try to ascertain what degree of presence or influence\nis intended to be implied by the various forms of impressional or\nphysical manifestation,\n3. And, lastly, let us consider what proofs of identity should be\nasked for, or might conceivably be given, or have actually been given\nby the spirits in question.\n1. Taken in itself, the list of communicating spirits seems to\nconsist of names selected almost at random. From various explana\ntions given by Imperator, we see that this list may be divided as\nfollows :\u2014\n(a) A group of high spirits, aiming at the advance of knowledge,\nand especially of religion, who have been able to discern Mr. Moses'\ngifts, and have to some extent themselves trained him for the purpose\nrequired. They have modified his early life : for instance, by prompt\ning him to his period of retirement on Mount Athos, and by keeping\nhim from wishing to marry. Some of these spirits, however, stand in\nvery distant relation to Mr. Moses, and their indications of presence\nor collaboration are of a purely arbitrary kind.\nThere are a group of spirits, it is said, belonging to various ages\nand countries, who are united by their desire to inform mankind\nof their destiny and duties. Each member of this group desires\nto show approval when an attempt is made at such communica\ntion. They cannot all take an active share, but, while some work\nactively, others express sympathy by choosing either a signature,\nor some special physical manifestation, to be associated with their\nnames, even if not actually produced by themselves. This form of\ncommunication is of course not meant to be in itself evidential; it\ndepends on the confidence reposed in the \" control \" in charge of the\nmanifestations ;\u2014much as when letters of encouragement are read\nat a public meeting, their genuineness is taken on trust from the\nchairman. Even when the handwriting produced, (either automatically\nthrough the medium, or directly, without the intervention of human\nhands), resembles that of the deceased person, this, as elsewhere ex\nplained, does not in itself prove identity. Well-known signatures\nespecially may be copied by other spirits.\nAs soon, however, as it is understood that such messages are not\nintended to be evidential, it seems not unnatural that they should\nbe given thus. It needs no derogation from the dignity of even the\nhighest spirit to express his sanction of any scheme designed to\nconvey to \" men of goodwill,\" in fashion however humble and un\nassuming, some message of their eternal fate.\n\fThe Expetiences of W. Stainton Moses. 10ft\nBut where identity is absolutely unprovable, as in the case of this\ngroup of \"men of old time,\" it would be futile to discuss the probabilities\non either side. I cannot blame Mr. Moses for his injunction to leave\nthese spirits\u2014eminent but not Divine\u2014under the mask of the symbolic\ntitles which they chose to assume. His reverence for Imperator was\nof a filial type which led him to desire that although there must be\ndiscussion about the doctrines, there should be none alxmt the actual\npersonality of the teacher to whom he felt that he owed all that was\nbest in his own inner life.\n(6.) The second group of communicating spirits consists of relatives\nand friends of the sensitive, or of other members of the group. This\nwould seem natural on any hypothesis, and the most curious question\nis not as to who is included in the list, but as to who is omitted.\nThere is no power of summoning any spirit at will. And it seems that\nsome spirits cannot return ;\u2014either from something in their own con\nstitution, or because they are restrained by over-ruling guides from\nwhat might be prejudicial to their progress. During this series of\nseances, an intimate friend of all the sitters\u2014mentioned in the M.S.S.\nas \" Sunshine \"\u2014passed away from earth. For her return, or for some\nmessage from her, however slight, Mr. Moses and his friends ask with\na persistency which should surely have produced for them her sem\nblance, if the messages had been but the shadow of their desire. Yet\nshe never manifests her presence in any way ; and the message of the\nguides about her is always that she is sleeping ; and that even when\nshe wakens it will not be thought fit for her to revisit earth.\nSomewhat similarly, Mr. Moses' own father manifests only once,\ncontrolling his son's hand to write one short \" word of fatherly\ngreeting,\" aiid no more.\nIt may be the case that the world beyond the grave is a world of\nmoral and emotional affinities, freed from merely casual or spatial\nseparations. But in communicating across the gulf this is not yet\nthus ; and, as on earth itself, the dearest may be inaccessible to us,\nwhile strangers press to our side.\n(c.) The third group consists, in fact, of undesired intruders;\u2014\nspirits mainly of low type and recently discarnated,\u2014-sometimes by\ntheir own violent act. These intrusions were occasionally of value as\nevidence ;\u2014as in the case of the man killed by a steam-roller, given\nabove. But the guides discourage the appearance of such spirits, even\nwarning Mr. Moses to avoid thinking of them, lest they thereby gain\nstrength to infest him. As a rule, indeed, they effected no injury\nbeyond a day or two's restlessness or fatigue. On one occasion only,\nwhen his own mind was greatly troubled by a gross wrong which had\nbeen done to him, and which he found it very hard to forgive, he\nseemed to feel a prolonged and injurious presence of bad spirits taking\n\f110 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\npleasure in his angry thoughts, and fanning his resentment. But ft is\nof importance to note that on the whole the occasional inconveniences\nof his sensitivity to spirit-influence were as nothing in his own view\ncompared with its benefits ; the sense of uplifting and strengthening\nwhich the communion of higher souls often brought to him, and even\ntheir every-day help (as he believed) in getting through his heavy work\nwithout breaking down.\nWhen he spoke to me of these benefits during his lifetime, I\nsupposed them to be merely subjective ; but I confess that the study of\nall this intimate matter has brought me nearer to his point of view ;\npresenting me with a picture of a character originally somewhat lack\ning in width and suavity, but essentially honest, resolute and manly,\nand controlled and disciplined into progress by spirits higher and wiser\nthan himself.\n(d.) A fourth and very important group consists of spirits willingly\nadmitted by the guides, as contributing proofs of identity while\nsatisfying their own desire to communicate. Such were Abraham\nFlorentine and \" Blanche Abercromby,\"\u2014the first of them apparently\nwishing to reach his wife with his message;\u2014the second\u2014with a touch\nentirely characteristic of that spirit as known to myself on earth\u2014\nimpelled by the mere desire to confess that she had been wrong ;\u2014\nto atone instantly and unreservedly for the injustice of her previous\ndistrust.\nIt is in cases of quite recent departure (I repeat), like the two here\nmentioned, that the evidence for identity seems to me strongest. In\nremoter cases, although facts unknown to the automatist may be\nproduced, the hypothesis of personating spirits, never absolutely re\nfutable, will have more plausibility than it has with the sudden eager\nmessages as from those who have just touched another shore.\n2. And this brings us to our second question ;\u2014as to what degree\nor kind of presence or influence is intended to be asserted, or can by\nus be accepted, in messages taken as genuinely in some way emanating\nfrom their alleged authors. In such an enquiry we are bound to begin\nby ridding our minds as far as we can of the conventional notion of a\npersonality consisting of one centre of consciouness only, operating in\none place alone. Even for the incarnated spirit such a conception has\nelsewhere lxeen shown to be in various ways too narrow. Even the\nconstraining prison of the body, with its one (though partially dupli\ncated) brain, through which all consciousness must find expression,\ncannot prevent the co-existence of more than one stratum of conscious\nness, nor the temporary transposition of what seems the main centre\nof consciousness to a distance from the body. When the centripetal\nforce of the body, so to call it, is withdrawn, wo must expect a still\ngreater possibility of multiple centres of consciousness, of dissociations\n\fThe Experiences of IP. Stainton Moses. Ill\nof the elements of personality. I have elsewhere compared \" haunt-\nings \" to \" dreams of the dead ; \" to some vague persistent thoughts,\nthat is to say, which may exist in the disembodied spirit, alongside of\nits fuller and truer existence, and may objectify themselves to terrestrial\nperception as though representing the entire departed soul.\nMr. Moses' experiences thijpw some light on this view. In the first\nplace, in the case of the higher spirits, it is expressly asserted that they\ncan act upon him from a distance, and can attend to many matters at\nthe same time. And, in the second place, spirits of ordinary type, not\nneccesarily low or \"earth-bound,\" are represented as recognising the\npresence of friends, and especially of a sensitive, near their graves.\nGrotesquely enough, this was a source of real annoyance to Mr. Moses\nevery Easter. It so chanced that Mrs. Moses' house at Bedford, to\nwhich her attentive son paid frequent visits, stands near a Moravian\nchurchyard. The Moravians, it seems, are in the habit of singing over\nthe graves of their dead at six o'clock every Easter morning, and Mr\nMoses' bedroom used to be filled with the noise of spirits agitated by\nthe ceremony1. It is not implied, however, that all these spirits\nwere present in such a manner that they were no longer conscious and\nactive elsewhere.\nAnd we may conceive that the whole concern with earth of a spirit\nlong departed may occupy as small a part of his total being as the\nremaining link with the body occupies in the being of a recently\ndeparted soul. The evidential inference from all this will be that we\ncannot use written communications of remote spirits as evidence of any\nthing like what we on earth should term actual presence.\n3. These preliminary considerations apply to all the messages, of\nwhatever nature their actual content may be. We must now briefly\ngo through the points which make a message primd facie evidential,\nwhich indicate, that is to say, that it actually does come in some way\nfrom its alleged source. This question, however, has been so often\ndiscussed in these Proceedings that a brief recapitulation of the main\nstages of evidential quality in messages given by automatic writing or\nby trance-utterances is all that will be needed here.\n1. Evidentially lowest comes the class of messages which is by far\nthe most common ; messages, namely, in which, although some special\nidentity may be claimed, all the facts given have been consciously\n1 I may mention here that Mr. Moses told me that he often saw spirits standing\n\u00bbbout in his bedroom while he undressed. Ue said that he was too tired to talk to\nthem, and that if notlooked at orencouraged they disappeared. It may be remembered\nthat Mr. Rowbotham (case 35) minifested in this way to Mr. Moses when alone. It\nis not unlikely that there would have been more recognitions of this kind had Mr.\nMoses sought them with more zeal ; but as soon he had become convinced as to\nidentity, his own interest reverted mainly to Imperator's teachings.\n\f112 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nknown to the automatist. Here we may well suppose that his own\npersonality alone is concerned, and that the messages have a subliminal,\nbut not an external source.\n2. Next above these come messages containing facts likely to be\nknown to the alleged spirit, and not consciously known to the automa\ntist ; but which facts may nevertheless have sometime been noted by\nthe automatist, even unwittingly, and may have thus obtained lodge\nment in his subliminal memory.\n3. Next come facts which can be proved,\u2014with such varying\ndegrees of certainty as such negative proof allows,\u2014never to have\nbeen in any way known to the automatist ; but which nevertheless\nare easily to be found in books ; so that they may have been learnt\nclairvoyantly by the automatist himself, or learnt and communicated\nto him by some mind other than that of the alleged spirit.\n4. Above this again would come that class of experimental mes\nsages, or posthumous letters, of which we have as yet only one good\n(although rather remote) example ; where the departed person has\nbefore death arranged some special test,\u2014some fact or sentence known\nonly to himself, which he is to transmit after death, if possible, as a\ntoken of his return. Every serious student of these problems, I think,\nshould do this ;\u2014should write down, for instance, some sentence,\u2014so\nsignificant to himself that he may hope to remember it afto' the shock\nof death ;\u2014should seal the letter and entrust it to safe keeping, and\nthen should seek in the next world any method open to him of com\nmunicating the test sentence to survivors.1\n5. Thus much for the various kinds of verbal messages, which can\nbe kept and analysed at leisure. We must now turn to evidence of a\ndifferent and not precisely comparable kind. In point of fact it is not\nthese inferences from written matter which have commonly been most\nefficacious in compelling the survivor's belief in the reality of the\nfriend's return. Whether logically or no, it is not so much the written\nmessage that he trusts, but some phantom of face and voice that he\nknew so well. It is this familiar convincing presence,\u2014e\u00abro 8e 0cT\u00abXoy\nauru,\u2014on which the percipient has always insisted, since Achilles\nstrove in vain to embrace Patroclus' shade.\nHow far such a phantasm is in fact a proof of any real action on the\npart of the spirit thus recognised is a problem which has been dealt\nwith already in various papers on Phantasms of the Dead. The\nupshot of our evidence to my mind is that although the apparition\nof a departed person cannot per se rank as evidence of his presence,\n1 Dr. Hodgson and I now hold a good many of such test-letters ; and we shall of\ncourse be glad to receive others, under such various conditions as the senders may\nimpose.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 113\nyet this is not a shape which purely hallucinatory phantasms seem often\nto assume : and if there be any corroborative evidence, as, fur instance,\n_ writing which claims to come from the same person, the chance that he\nis really operative is considerable. In Mr. Moses' case almost all the\nfigures which he saw brought with them some corroboration by writing,\ntrance-utterance, gesture-messages (as where a figure makes signs of\nassent or dissent), or raps.\n6. And this brings us to a class of case3 largely represented in Mr.\nMoses' series, where writings professing to come from a certain spirit\nare supported by physical phenomena of which that spirit claims also\nto be the author. Whether such a line of proof can ever be made\nlogically complete or no, one can imagine many cases where it would\nbe practically convincing to almost all minds. Materialisations of\nhands, or direct writing in the script of the departed, have much\nof actual cogency ; and these methods, with others like them, are, as\nwe have seen, employed by Mr. Moses' \" controls \" in their efforts to\nestablish their own identities. Physical phenomena in themselves,\nindeed, carry no proof of an intelligence outside that of the sensitive\nhimself. Trance utterance, or automatic script, also, as we have seen,\nfalls short in itself of proving the action of an external mind. When\nGrocyn, for instance, answers questions by making musical sounds\n(heard by all present) in the air, it is not inconceivable that the\nsensitive's own dream should clothe itself in Grocyn's imagined per\nsonality, and should then exteriorise itself in objective phenomena\ncorresponding to that self-suggestion. Where all is so obscure, such\npossibilities should be duly noted ; but the hypothesis seems too far\nfetched to be permanently acceptable.\nBut the questions now opening before us involve too much of\ndiscussion and of theory to fall suitably within this series of items of\ndefinite evidence. In these two papers I have given, I think, a\nsufficiently full account of Mr. Moses' physical phenomena, explaining\nmy reasons for believing in their genuineness ; and also a sufficiently\nfull account of communications professing to proceed,\u2014and, as I\nbelieve, for the most part really proceeding,\u2014from spirits who have\nrecently quitted this earthly life. Much more matter remains; matter\nwhich seems to me to help us towards a more coherent view as to\nthe nature of relations between disembodied spirits and spirits still\ninhabiting this tabernacle of flesh. At some future date, should my\nreaders desire it, I shall hope to recount some more of Mr. Moses'\nphenomena, and to discuss the directions in which, taken in con\nnection with other phenomena of like nature, they seem, however\ndimly and obscurely, to direct our onward view.\nl\n\f114 \"Miss X\"\nIV.\nON THE APPARENT SOURCES OF\nSUBLIMINAL MESSAGES.\nBy \"Miss X.\"\n[For the benefit of any readers who may not be familiar with\nprevious volumes of our Proceedings, it is well to state that \" Miss X.\"\nis the lady who contributed a paper on Recent Experiments in Crystal-\nVision, printed in Vol. V., p. 486, and a paper entitled A Record of\nTelepathic and other Experiences in Vol. VI., p. 358.\u2014H. Sidgwick.]\nThe aim of the following pages is solely that of presenting a\nfamiliar subject from a less familiar point of view. Much has already\nbeen written on the question of the Sources of Messages ; many\ntheories propounded which it is not my concern either to establish\nor confute ; many experiences quoted, to which it is not in my power\nto add much that is new, or anything that is startling. I simply\nmake an attempt to examine a few simple experiences from the point\nof view of the Subject, rather than from that, more familiar, of the\nspectator or the experimenter.\nMy own experiences, from which I propose to draw, have in them\nlittle of the marvellous ; they are all of a most ordinary nature ; they\nclaim no merit but that of being carefully observed and recorded. For\nthat very reason\u2014because they present no special difficulties, because\nthey are for the most part, as compared with others which have'been\ndescribed to us, mere commonplace \u2014they are perhaps the better\nmaterial for elementary enquiry.\nI have attempted in several instances, mainly of so trivial a nature\nas not to absorb one's conscious attention at the moment of their\noccurrence, to analyse the impression which they created, to observe\nthe nature of the sensations they aroused, and to measure the degree\nand kind of the emotion or train of thought, if any, by which they\nwere accompanied.\nThat this analysis is far from satisfactory, I am quite as conscious\nas the severest 'critic could wish ; this is the case for many reasons,\nsome of them sufficiently obvious. The analysis of sensation is pro\nverbially difficult at all times, and the analysis of sensation in some\ndegree apart from one's ordinary experience, apart largely from that\nof others, having little analogy with other strata of one's conscious\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 115\nness, little help from antecedent probability and ordinary a priori\ndeduction, has in it perhaps some elements of especial perplexity.\nI propose to deal with such phenomena as are purely spontaneous,\nfor, directly the question of experiment is introduced, we introduce\nalso the element of that self-consciousness which I venture to think\nfatally destructive of just those conditions which it is most useful to\nobserve. And, just because of this, just because the phenomenon is\nin greater or less degree a shock, it is very obvious that we have, at\nthe outset, the inevitable condition of surprise which, in some sort,\ndisqualifies the subject for exact observation.\nWe might compare our position with that of an estate holder who,\nwith the help of a Divining Rod, has lately discovered a fertile spring\nupon his property. A few years ago we were prepared to admit the\npossible existence of water somewhere, deep down, far out of sight,\nbut we were less prepared to admit that there were possibilities of in\nsome degree commanding a supply by empirical methods. A few hud\nbrought to us specimens of the precious fluid. Most of us knew people\nwho had some sort of experience for which they could not account,\nbut we dismissed the phenomena as so far removed from ordinary\nexperience as to seem either wholly fortuitous, or mere charlatanry.\nThe word \" fortuitous \" we now modify into \" spontaneous,\" recognis\ning that the phenomena are governed by laws, however little known\nor understood. In place of professional charlatanry we have now the\nresults of organised experiment. The Divining Rod has been found\nto respond to other than professional manipulation, and systematised\nenquiry has become possible. We no longer dispute the existence of the\nphenomena. We even classify the methods of their production under\nsuch groupings as \"automatism,\" \" telepathy,'' \"hypnotic suggestion,\"\nself-suggestion, and the like. But our classifications sometimes merely\nname while powerless to explain the phenomena. We want to go a\nstep further back, to formulate, if possible, some system which shall\nhelp us to refer effect to cause. And when we remember that our\nmaterial, our unit of thought, is not mere inorganic matter or a gas,\na group of animals or plants, but a sentient, thinking human being,\nit seems as if our enquiry should have special advantages and facili\nties, in that we are not dependent solely on our own observation\u2014that\nthe subject of our enquiry can intelligently participate in the experi\nment, can itself observe, analyse, and record.\nWhen considering the various psychological experiments of the\nkind now so familiar to us, which aim at classifying and explaining\nthe impulses and emotions of the patient, one is sometimfs tempted to\nask, as in regard to other forms of vivisection, What is the Subject's\npoint of view 1 This is the standpoint from which I propose to indicate\nnot, as yet, a clue to the solution of the problem of the Sources of\nl 2\n\f116 \"Miss X:\nSubliminal Messages, but, rather, a few of the difficulties which beset\nus in the attempt.\nMy friends have often said, \" Surely you must have some impres\nsion of the nature of the phenomenon while it is passing, whether the\nmessage comes from without or from within, how far it is externalised,\nwhether'your vision\u2014supposing a vision to be in question\u2014is an exter-\nnalisation of your own thought or mental perception; whether it is,\nso to speak, an emanation from some mind still in the flesh, or whether\nit is some definite message from a discarnate mind 1 \"\nSuch a question, it might seem, should be, by an intelligent\nobserver, easy of answer.\nI confess, however, to feeling great sympathy with those who find\nit difficult to analyse sensations of this kind\u2014possibly, even, some im\npatience with those who have a pigeon-hole ready prepared and\ndocketed for the reception of each impression as it arises.\nI.\u2014Let me illustrate this point from the very simplest class of\nmessages with which I am personally familiar, those in which a\nmessage is received, having no obvious corresponding sense im\npression.\nOne morning, July 20th, 1890, I had spent the whole morning, for\nI was recovering from recent illness, lying on a long chair on the\nlawn. I could not move without help, and was therefore incapacitated\nfrom going back to the house and forgetting that I had done so, as\nmight otherwise have been the case. About twelve o'clock a friend\ncasually calling, came through the drawing-room window into the\ngarden to talk to me. When she returned to the house about half an\nhour later, a book which she had left in the hall was not to be found,\nand after a prolonged hunt in every likely place, she, with another\nfriend, came back to the garden to see whether she could have left it\nnear me. On hearing their story I at once remarked, \" The book lies\non the blue-room bed.\" The statement seemed wildly improbable, as\nthe room in question was not in use, and was seldom entered even by\nthe servants. There, nevertheless, on the bed, the book was found.\nSome workmen had come into the house during the morning, bringing\na number of pictures and books belonging to a friend, to be taken care\nof for a short time, and these, for safety, had been placed in the dis\nused room, the book lying on the hall table having been accidentally\nincluded with the new arrivals.\nNow, how is one to explain a circumstance of even this simple\nkind ? One can hardly dismiss it as mere \" coincidence,\" for this is\nbut a specimen of a type of incident which occurs very frequently.\nIt would be somewhat far-fetched to call it \" telepathic,\" as the book\nwas unconsciously removed, and we have no reason to suppose that\nthe workman was aware of having included it among those he was\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 117\ncarrying. Jfo one in the house had seen its removal. The impression\ncannot have been, in any literal sense, clairvoyant, because there\nwas no conscious picture in my mind. I formed no vision\u2014of a kind\noften seen\u2014of the whereabouts of the volume. I had no reason for\nthe statement. I was not conscious even of forming a yuets. I\ncan only describe the impulse in some such phrase as \" It came into\nmy head to say \"\u2014this, and many other things of a like kind, equally\ntrue, equally improbable, and equally unexpected.\nI would group this with another case with which it has some\nfeatures in common, though the source of the message is perhaps more\napparent. A very intimate friend had died, and we found a sad\npleasure in reading and discussing the many notices of his life and\nwork which appeared in newspapers and magazines. One afternoon\nhis sister, a friend, and myself were speculating as to the probable\nauthorship of an article containing details of a kind so intimate that\nwe felt sure the author must be a personal friend. Several names were\nsuggested and dismissed ; at last one of my friends remarked : \"I seem\nto have a hazy notion who it ought to be, but I can't get hold of it.\"\nAt that moment my eye fell upon the paper in question, and across it\nI read in the handwriting of my deceased friend (I do not give the\nreal name) Henry Roberts\u2014a name which, to the best of my belief, I\nnever heard before. \" That is the man ! \" my friend exclaimed\u2014when\nour companion interrupted, \" What Roberts do you mean ?\" \" The\nOxford man.\" \"But I don't remember one. Where does he live!\"\n\"I don't know. I don't fancy he belongs to any college.\" At this point\n\u2014again on the paper before me, and again in the handwriting of my\nfriend\u2014I read (I do not give the real name) Montagu Street.\nIt so happens that both of my friends are much more familiar\nwith Oxford than I am, and the street I have called \" Montagu \" is a\nvery unimportant one.\nThe friend who had recognised the name of the man was not able\nto say whether my further statement was correct, but the other lady\nremarked, \" There is a Montagu Street, I know ; but the only man I\ncan remember living there is one whose name I forget\u2014a great botan\nizing man.\" \"That is Roberts,\" said my friend. \" He is a botanist,\nand he and my brother were great friends, and so the statement is quite\nlikely to be true.\"\nNow the crowning mystery of this story is that it wasn't true, and\nthe article was written by some one quite different ; so, had I accepted\nthe communication as coming from my deceased friend (which\nhappily I did not) I should have added one more to the multitude of\ncases one constantly hears of\u2014of lying spirits and false messages\u2014\nwhich would have been for me a very new and a very distressing ex\nperience indeed.\n\f118 \"Miss X.\"\nI find no difficulty in supposing that I received the name, Henry\nRoberts, from the mind of my friend who was trying to think of it,\ninstances of sub-conscious knowledge coming to the surface in the\nmind of a second person more readily than in that of the thinker,\nbeing common enough. The \" Montagu Street\" question is a little\nmore difficult ; but we may perhaps explain it, either as forgotten\nknowledge on the part of the friend who transmitted the name Henry\nRoberts, or as a forgotten association with the name Henry Roberts,\non the part of our other friend, who knew the name of the street, and\nnot that of the man.\nIn both of the cases quoted two of the friends present were those\nwho, in former accounts of experiments and observations, have been\nreferred to as D. and H., and it seems likely that their presence was in\nsome sense contributory to the experience, though, in the case of the\nlost book, their ignorance of its whereabouts was, to their great incon\nvenience, as complete as my own.\nIn a former paper I gave some examples of common percipience, or\ncollective thought-transference, of H. and myself, and speculated as to\nwhether she or I were to be considered the Agent in such experiences.\nA very recent example would seem, at first sight, to suggest that the\nmessage was transmitted through her, though the experience lends itself\nalso to another interpretation.\nOn Saturday, January 12th, 1895, about ten o'clock in the morning,\nI went into D.'s room and found her writing letters. She happened\nalmost immediately to be called away, and left saying\u2014\" I was just\nwriting to H. You may as well go on with the letter.\" Accordingly, I\ntook up the pen, when \" it came into my head \" to write, as under other\ncircumstances it might have \" come into my head \" to say, that I feared\nshe had been ill or troubled lately, and I hoped that nothing was wrong.\nIt so happens that I don't write to H once in six months, and I was\nsomewhat struck by the nature of this revival of our correspondence,\nand added half a page of nonsense and chatter to take the edge off. I\nam constantly in the society of her family and friends, I had had a letter\nfrom her husband at Christmas saying that H. was too much occupied\nwith guests to write, and neither D. nor I had any reason whatever to\nsuppose that anything distressing had occurred. Later, on the same day,\none of her sisters called, and we naturally asked for the latest news of\nH. We were met with the assurance \"Oh she's all right ; very busy,\"\nand I dismissed my fears. The same evening, however, D. received a\nletter from H. written early that morning to ask \"do you know if any\nthing is wrong with K. [a younger sister] 1 I kept hearing her call me in\nthe night and fear that she is ill,\"\u2014the enquiry being made of D. rather\nthan of her own family because K. is somewhat nervous. During a long\nillness some years ago, H, the elder sister, had acted as K.'s nurse, and\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 119\nhad been accustomed to be frequently aroused during the night, and\nto be ready at all hours of the day to obey the call of the invalid.\nK., who is now in average health, had, we found, in point of fact been\nsuffering at the time referred to, and her thoughts had naturally turned\nto her former nurse.\nThe following is H.'s account of the receipt of my enquiry.\nFebruary 10th.\n\" I remember well the letter I received from [D.] dated January 12th.\nI am very sorry I destroyed it. The letter in question was begun by [D],\nand then the rest of the first page was written by you, in which were eon-\ntamed these words in your handwriting, ' [X] is staying here till Monday.\nShe is quite well, thank you, but what is wrong with you ? ' This letter I\nreceived the following day, Sunday, January 13th. On Saturday, 12th.,\nthe same day on which you and [D.] wrote yours, I wrote to [D.] telling her\nhow I had been disturbed on Friday night by hearing K. call out, and\nseeing her with a very distressed face.\"\nThe following is from the letter to D. to which H. refers.\nJanuary 12(A.\n\" Last night I could not sleep much, and I had been awake along while\nwhen, some time after 4 o'clock I think, I heard, as if it were in the room,\nK.'s voice ... I turned and saw her, looking ghastly. I can't get her\nface out of my mind; 1 hope she is all right.\"\nCommenting upon the incident under date February 10th, H.\nwrites :\u2014\n\" I was much worried about it all day, and mentioned it to my husband\nand to Mrs. R., and they both remember it.\"\nThere was nothing in my writing which could be called \"automatic.\"\nI knew perfectly well what I was going to say, and was equally con\nscious of the unreasonableness of the impulse. At the same time though\nnot under any compulsion to write, I felt, as in many such cases, that\nthe impulse to write was stronger than the impulse to refrain. As a\nmere question of distance, K., who lives a few^mndred yards away, was\nmore likely to affect me than H., who lives a hundred miles away ; and\nyet, unless the whole thing were a mere coincidence, K.'s distress, close\nwas the exciting cause of a message which reached me from a dis\ntant county. It is worth while to mention that, though I have received\nmany impressions from H., they have all been veridical, as have hers\nfrom me, with the one possible exception that she wrote to D. a few\nweeks ago asking whether I had lost a stone out of a pearl ring, when,\nin point of fact, I had shortly before lost an amethyst out of another\nring on the same finger. This might have been a chance coincidence,\nthough it seems the less likely for the fact that, so fax as I know, I never\n\f120 \"Mies X.\"\nlost a stone out of a ring before, and H. never, except on that occasion\nreceived the impression of my having lost anything.\nI had a curious series of impressions of this kind,\u2014unexternalised\u2014\nlast September under rather special circumstances.\nI had been asked by the owners of a house, reputed to be haunted,\nto pay them a visit, in the hope of elucidating the mystery of the alleged\nghost. I had heard the details of the case from a neighbour of theirs,\nand beyond the invitation had had no correspondence with them, and\nknew absolutely nothing about them, except that they were young\nmarried people with some little children, and were very highly respected.\nI had a'ready formed the conclusion that the phenomena were mainly\nsubjective, and that it was a case for Bell, Book and Candle, and know\ning that the alleged ghost had been the occasion of real distress, I felt\nsome responsibity for my visit, which I thought would either remove or\nemphasize the discomfort of my host and hostess, and of others depen\ndent upon them. I was anxious, as far as possible, to earn their con\nfidence, to secure such help as might be in the difficult task of uproot\ning, in the course of a day or two's visit from a total stranger, an idea\nwhich had had possession of their minds for over two years. It is\nalmost the only time when I have really longed for the power of\ncontrolling phenomena, so as to be able to \"show off\" at will.\nI knew, however, that wishing would not help matters, and that I\nmust await events.\nMy hostess drove me up from the station and courteously expressed\nher sense of the trouble I had taken in coming to so uncanny a house\nand among entire strangers. \" We all tried guesing what you would be\nlike,\" she said, \" but it matters much more to you what we are like.\"\nThere was my chance, \" Perhaps I know,\" I said, \" let me describe your\nhusband;\"--and hardly knowing from one phrase to another what I was\ngoing to say. I sketched a personality which I had certainly not con\nsciously conceived, and which had certain marked pecularities,\u2014 \" very\ntall, extremely thin, with low forehead and unusually overhanging brows\nand deep set eyes, clean shaven.\" I quote from memoranda made at\nthe time. My hostess listened in silentsurprise, and her only comment\nwas \"You must have seen him ! \" Next we discussed the house. \"Have\nyou had it ever since you were married?\" I asked. \"No,\" she said,\n\" we first lived at another place a few miles off. We came here two\nyears ago.\" \"And in the meanwhile you went to New Zealand 1 \" I\nwas impelled to remark. This too proved correct, though I said it with\nas little perception of its meaning as if I were pronouncing words in an\nunknown language.\nLater, when I came downstairs, after changing my dress, I was\nintroduced to my host, who had, I found, been suitably impressed\nby the account of these lucky hits. Something was said of a visitor\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 121\nto lunch the following day. \" Is her name Clara Stimpson ? \" I was\nagain prompted to enquire. This too proved correct .1\nSo far my impulses had been impulse merely, without any sense im\npressions. The words \" rose to my lips,\" in a very literal sense. But\nwhen a gentleman present asked me how \" Stimpson,\" not a common\nname, was spelt, I had a momentary visualisation. The name is familiar\nto me only as that of a certain London tradesman, who spells it Stim-\n8on. One of his carts rose before my mind's eye with the letter p\ninserted in the name above the s. \" With a p,\" I said confidently, which\nwas correct.\nThe next day I was returning alone from a walk, when I met my\nhost in the carriage drive. \"Miss Stimpson is here,\" he said. \"She\nknows about what you said last night, and we want to see whether\nyou can pick her out from the three ladies on the lawn.\"\nI am too slow-sighted to distinguish easily even those with whose\npersonality I am familiar, and I felt that here again was a case for\nself-abandonment. I walked up with perfect confidence to one of the\nthree (they were all of about the same age and general appearance)\nand said, \" You are Miss Stimpson,\" which proved correct. This\nhowever, by itself, would not be of any value, as I had only two\nchances of missing.\nAfter that I was reduced to terror lest it should occur to my\nnew friends to ask awkward questions dangerous to my new found\nreputation. I was by no means reassured when I learnt that part of\nthe programme arranged for me was that I should \" tell them their\nfortunes ! \"\nThis I declined, but offered to \" read their characters.\" The\npower of character-reading is of course simply a result of the habit of\nobservation, and in four of the cases present I knew, before I began,\nthat I should find the task easy enough. But I was not prepared to\nfind myself sketching scenes in their past lives, and I listened with as\nlittle expectation and quite as impersonally, as if the voice speaking\nwere that of some one else.\nIt would not be fair to repeat these statements, but all who were\npresent will bear me out in saying that the facts were all perfectly\ncorrect, and perfectly definite in kind.\nI may add, incidentally, that I succeeded in \" laying the ghost \" so\nfar that, though the previous manifestations had been very frequent,\nnothing has been heard of him since the date of my visit (August 29th\nto September 1st, 1894.)\nI have long felt that some degree of exaltation is conducive to\nexperiences of this kind. This of course may he of all degrees and\n1 Clara Stimpnon is the real name.\n\f122 Miss X-\nvarieties, the one necessary condition being, I believe, self-abandon\nment, and self-forgetfulness\u2014whatever the motive. In the present\ninstance my motive was a very strong one, and I never remember\nhaving so many impressions of the kind, without a single failure, in\nthe course of so short a time, for all occurred within 24 hours of my\narrival, after which, as I felt that the necessary preliminaries were\nachieved, and I had other work to accomplish, nothing more of the\nkind happened.\nI have sent a copy of the passages in my diary referring to the\nabove incidents to my host and hostess, with the following note, which\nthey have signed :\u2014\n\" The above statements are perfectly true, and, so far as we know, Miss\nX. could not have obtained the knowledge she displayed of our private\nconcerns by any recognised method.\"\nIn my diary I find another recent example of this unformulated\nimpulse to express what has never been consciously a thought.\nIn this instance I cannot attribute the impulse in any degree to\nspecial interest in the subject concerned, for nothing could be more\nfutile, more absolutely without importance except merely as a psycho\nlogical curiosity.\nOn August 15th last I was staying with my friend, Mrs. T., at a\nhotel in Scotland. When I wanted to ring for the maid in the morn\ning, I found that my bell-pull was broken, and there was nothing for\nit but to go to the door of my friend's room, and ask her to ring, and\ngive the necessary order.\nKnowing that she was in bed, and the door locked, I intended to\ncall out, \" Will you ring your bell, please,\" but the words resolved them\nselves into, \"Who is Frances at Eastbourne 1\" \"I must be going daft,\"\nI thought, and when my friend called back, \" What 1 What did you\nsay ? \" I succeeded, though with an effort, in telling her of my needs.\nIt was not till we were creeping up the Caledonian Canal some few\nhours later that I had an opportunity of telling her of the ridiculous\nincident. \" I don't know any Frances, do you 1 \" I added. My friend\nlaughed heartily, and answered, \"Well, no, I don't, but I had a letter\nyesterday about a Frances, who is going to Eastbourne, in whom I feel\nsome second-hand interest What sort of a Frances 1 \" To my own\nsurprise I had an answer ready. \"A Frances,\" I said; \"an oldish lady\nin a cap.\" \" Quite true,\" said my friend, \" I have never seen the lady,\nbut she must be quite old enough to wear a cap.\" Mrs. T. confirms\nher share of this incident as follows :-\u2014.\n\"[On] August 15th, as we were going up the Caledonian Canal on the\nsteamer, Miss X. said to me ' Who is Frances at Eastbourne 1 ' I was very\nastonished, as I do not know the Frances in question, but one of my\ncorrespondents a few days previously had told me of her visit to them at\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 123\nEastbourne. When I asked Miss X. for details, she said, ' I know the\nFrances is a woman, because of the way the name is spelt, and she is an\noldish lady with a cap.' \"\nIn a later note Mrs. T. adds :\u2014\n\"The Frances in question is an oldish lady and probably wears a cap.\"\nThis sort of thing is almost irritating. It is quite useless, and\nnot even amusing. If there is only a certain allowance of thought-\ntransference or clairvoyance or the like, why cannot it be more\nusefully expended 1 In my own case I am not even able to deduce any\nconclusions. I have expressed all I am conscious of concerning it\nwhen I say\u2014\" it came into my head.\" I believe, too, that I am\njustified in adding\u2014\"and such as the information is, I always feel\nthat it is true.\"\nII.\u2014Another group of subliminal messages is that which externa\nlises itself in visual form. I find that others, less accustomed than\nmyself to the receipt of messages from the sub-conscious stratum of\none's mind, find it somewhat difficult to sympathise in my feeling that\nthis class is less startling, more natural, so to speak, than the group,\nin some way more simple, with which I have dealt, so far. There is\nalways, to me, something weird, something which quickens one's pulses\nand excites the kind of physical discomfort known as \" feeling a cold\nwind,\" familiar to frequenters of seances, in listening to unfamiliar\nstatements proceeding from one's own lips, in not knowing what you\nmay be led, or perhaps driven, to say next.\nAs I have had occasion to state in previous articles, I habitually\nthink in terms of sight. Though often congratulated on the possession\nof unusual powers of memory, I am absolutely unable to recall any\nthing which I cannot visualise. Even numbers when heard only, not\nseen, I associate with musical sounds, and these, in turn with combina\ntions of colour. Consequently every idea or recollection, consciously\ndwelt upon, is visualised, and in many cases, dramatised,\u2014-that is, my\npictures have life and movement. For this reason, a scene conjured\nnp either in the crystal or, as the professional medium would say, \"in\nthe surroundings \" of those about me, has in it none of the disconcert\ning elements of the less externalised impression. It is more in con\nformity with my habits\u2014has a greater share in my consciousness ;\nmoreover it is, except in the rare cases of \" collective hallucination,\"\nmy own property, with which I am not obliged to part, except by my\nown choice.\nAnd here I should like to say, in the interests of those whom such\nof us as \" collect cases \" are perpetually badgering for evidence, that I\nbelieve the instinct of the subject of such experience is to be silent\nabout it. I was disposed till lately to regard as a personal peculiarity\n\f124 'Miss X.\nthe sort of dumbness which strikes one at the moment of its occur\nrence. I can go away and write it down\u2014I can talk about it later ;\nI can even while it is present make trivial remarks on other topics,\nand \" keep up \" a conversation, but it is obviously easier to say to an\nafternoon visitor, \" Do you take sugar 1 \" or \" Won't you have some\nmore cake?\" than, \" Don't be startled\u2014but your deceased husband\u2014\nor an unknown lady\u2014or a portion of the countenance of some human\nbeing, sex indeterminate,\" as the case may be, \" is looking over your\nleft shoulder.\" My visitor might not like it, for one thing ; one has a\nguilty sensation of listening at key-holes, for another; for myself I have\nalways the physical discomfort of being out of breath (a fact which\nmay suggest more explanations than one), and finally one feels much\nas the young man does over his first sonnet (school-exercises not being\ncounted), which he locks up in his desk for a length of time propor\ntionate to the depth of the sentiments which gave it birth.\nWhen, during my late visit to Scotland, I was brought in contact\nwith more seers in six weeks than in the whole of my previous life\ntime, I had the opportunity of noting the same conspiracy of silence,\nand of seeking to discover its cause. Again and again I came across\nstories, which, if true, and I had no reason to doubt them, went to\nshow that, over and over again, catastrophes might have been averted,\nand trouble, greater or less, arrested in its course, if those who saw\nvisions would have spoken out in time. I quote in illustration one\nstory which struck us with some indignation, and which we had at first\nhand from the principal actor and the principal witness, two young\nmen working in a quarry not far from Oban. One of the two, the\nfifth seer in a direct line in his family, had a brother who was about to\nrow in a regatta on a loch some miles away. It was arranged that the\nquarrymen were to join him, but when the day came for their projected\nholiday, the seer declined to go, or to allow his friend to go, but would\ngive no reason. Later, a telegram came to say that the brother was\ndrowned. \" I knew it,\" said the seer ; \" I knew it was to be so.\" We\nasked why he had not warned his brother against his impending fate.\nHe seemed to think the very notion profane\u2014an interference with \"the\nwill o' the Lord.\" We asked why he did not at least tell of his vision,\nand allow others to draw their own inferences. That, he said\u2014and we\nheard this and the other excuse dozens of times\u2014would never do :\nif you did that \"ye'd hae nae mair,\" and indeed we constantly heard\nof \"telling of the first\" as a means of curing oneself of being a seer\nagainst one's will.\nI cannot always share the impatience which the psychical\ninvestigator often shows towards the witness who did not relate his\ndream or intuition in time to make a good, well-evidenced \" case \" of\nit. The tendency to delay, however interpreted, is one in which I can\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 125\nsympathise and I often record an intuition with a secret longing to\nanathematise the training which has made my conscience troublesome\non such points.\nBut to return to the question of visualised impressions, or intuitions,\nor transference of thought.\nThe first example I shall quote is one in support of which I can\nbring no direct evidence. Had it occurred lately I could not, in the\nnature of things, tell the story at all. Two intimate friends who heard\nit a few days after its occurrence, can testify that the story has not\nvaried in the interval, but that is all in the nature of corroboration\nI can offer.\nWe all, probably, know the sensation on being introduced to any\none who excites our interest or curiosity, of making a conscious effort\nto grasp the stranger's individuality\u2014an effort quite different from the\nspontaneous sympathy established with a friend. In my own case\nthis effort is occasionally assisted in a somewhat unusual manner. A\npicture will form itself in the background of the stranger, which sug\ngests a clue to the problem he presents\u2014some indication of a dominant\nfactor in his life or experience, the origin of which I find it difficult to\nascertain. Thus :\u2014\nI was visiting for the first time at the house of a friend who had\nrecently married. Her husband I had never met, but all that I had\never heard led me to expect to find him an agreeable gentleman of good\nbirth, fortune, and position. We were introduced, and I soon\nperceived that he had, at least, the wish to please, and to show hospi\ntality to all the guests assembled. However, from the first moment\nthat I had opportunity to observe him carefully, I was troubled by a\ncurious and perplexing hallucination. No matter where he happened\nto be\u2014at the dinner table, in the conservatory, at the piano\u2014for me\nthe real background disappeared and a visionary scene succeeded. I\nsaw the same man in his boyhood\u2014he was in reality very youthful in\nappearance\u2014gazing towards me with an expression of abject terror,\nhis head bowed, his shoulders lifted, his hands raised as if to defend\nhimself from expected blows.\nI discovered afterwards that this scene was one which had really\ntaken place at a famous public school, when, in consequence of a dis\ngraceful act of fraud, he was ignominiously expelled, and had to \" run\nthe gauntlet \" of his schoolfellows.\nNow, how is such a circumstance to be explained 1 My own feeling\nis that the picture was symbolic ; that this was, if one may so speak,\na precipitated specimen of the man's moral atmosphere\u2014\" a taste of\nhis quality \"\u2014and my impression is strengthened by the fact that the\ndistrust the incident inspired in my mind has been amply justified\nby subsequent very disastrous events. Such a scene as this seems\n\f126 \"Miss X.\nanalogous to those suggested by \" trace \"\u2014the picture called up by a\npsychometric impression rather than one directly telepathic. It would\nbe far-fetched to suppose that the scene\u2014which had occurred at least\nten years before, and was probably not a uniquely disgraceful incident\n\u2014was literally present in the mind of its chief actor.\nIt was by the light of this very circumstance that I interpreted,\nperhaps wrongly, for quite a different interpretation also suggests\nitself, a later circumstance which occurred little more than a year ago.\nIn October, 1S93, I happened one day to call on a friend who was\nengaged, I was told, with a visitor from the north. Though the visitor\nwas unknown to me, I recognised his name as that of a correspondent\nof whom I remembered nothing definite except that he had spoken of\nhimself as the pupil of a certain professor, whose lectures in'philosophy\nand logic I had myself attended.\nBy some accident I remained standing for a minute or two before\nhe was introduced to me, and had thus an opportunity of observing\nhim, which I did with some interest. I have already explained more\nthan once that I am so strong a visualiser that my impressions, when\nat all vivid, constantly assume an objective form, and I see them before\nme as a picture, often allegorical. On this occasion I saw, standing\nnear Mr. H., the tall figure of a, Hindoo whose dress and bearing I\nobserved carefully, and whose appearance I took to be a symbolic pre\nsentation of the thought which passed through my mind, \" You\ndon't look much like philosophy, not a Kantian or Hegelian anyway,\nmystic possibly\u2014meditative and receptive\u2014not observant or critical.\nPerhaps you have played with theosophy.\"\nWhen I moved across the room for conversation, the figure disap\npeared, but some time later, when our talk happened to turn on the\nsources of messages, I mentioned the circumstance, and Mr. H. seemed\ndeeply interested.\nOn November 23rd I received a letter from Mr. H. reminding me\nof the incident, and asking me (saying that he would, later, explain\nhis reasons) to answer the following questions :\u2014\n1. When and where did you see the vision ?\n2. To what nationality did he belong ?\n3. How was he dressed, and in what colour 1\n4. Did he wear anything on his head ?\n5. What colour was his hair ?\n6. What sort of features ? Lips thick or thin 1\n7. What was his manner towards me 1\nI answered these questions to the best of my ability, and by return\nof post received a letter from Mr. H. relating that a few days before\n(November 20th) he had had an interview with a clairvoyant footman\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliniinal Messages. 127\nwho had, quite spontaneously, described the same figure which I had\nmyself seen five weeks earlier. For the sake of comparing details, Mr.\nH.'s questions to me were framed upon the description given by the\nmedium. My answers were from memory only, as I had made no note\nof the incident at the time, and the following, from Mr. H.'s diary, does\nnot give details. I may, however, observe that he believes that there\nis no discrepancy between my earlier and later descriptions.\n\"The note I have of your interview is as follows (entered November 18th,\n1893) :\u2014On October 10th or 11th I [was introduced to Miss X. who told me]\nthat on entering the room where we were, she saw a vision (as it were) of an\nIndian gentleman, presumably a philosopher, standing behind me and vanish\ning immediately after I rose to shake hands with her. This vision she said\nshe interpreted to mean that I was under an oriental control and should\ntherefore presumably be fond of psychology, logic, metaphysics, and specula\ntive thought generally.\n\"She was careful to explain that she did not regard the vision as proof of\nthe real existence of such a spirit, but merely as a symbolical embodiment or\nprojection from her own mind of a conception which she had formed of my\ncharacter. She then looked, she told me, at the shape of my thumb, and\nthough not a believer in palmistry, and believing that the lines on the hands\nare inherited from our prehensile ancestors, she thought that this part being\nlarge was indicative of some considerable logical argumentative or reasoning\npower.\"\n[This is not quite what I meant to convey. I considered Mr. H.'s\nhand very interesting from the curious resemblance of a somewhat\nnnusually shaped thumb to that of a Parsee acquaintance, a great\nstudent of logic and of classical and oriental mysticism. I have never\nbeen convinced of the justice of the pretensions of the alleged\n\" Science \" of palmistry, but I often glean indications from what one\nmay call the expression of the hand, and have sometimes found that the\npalm may act as, so to speak, a point de repere for thought-transference\nor intuitional impressions.]\nI now append Mr. H.'s report on his comparison of evidence :\u2014\n\"Miss X.\"\nOn entering the room I saw a vision\nof a man standing behind you.\nHe was an Indian ; a Hindoo, or\nperhaps a Parsee.\nHis clothes were white, apparently\ncotton or thin silk with a coloured\nbordering.\nThe Footman,\nThere's a man standing by you\nnow.\nHe is a furrener (foreigner). He\nisn't white and he isn't black, but\nhe's a kind of dark orange, a sort\nof Mulatto colour.\nHe's dressed all in white ; he's got\na kind of brown holland suit on.\n\f128 \"Miss X.\"\n\" Miss X.\"\nHe had a white cotton or silk turban\non his head, with a red edge.\nHis hair and his whiskers were very\ndark.\nHis lips were rather thin but not re\nmarkable.\nHe stared before him with Hindoo\nindifference, but seemed to regard\nyou as his property. He stood\nquite close to you with his hand on\nyour shoulder. He had a sort of\nguardian spirit air ; a sort of in-\nspirer of your existence air ; a\ngeneral air of proprietorship and of\nyour belonging to him.\nThe Footman.\nHe's got a white turban on his\nhead.\nHe's got dark hair and darkwhiskers;\nvery dark.\nHis lips are neither thick nor thin,\nbut medium.\nHe looks at you very lovingly. He\nknows you very well, and looks as\nif he could take you up in his\narms and hug you. He stands\nvery close to you, so he must be\nvery intimate with you.\nAt the risk of apparent repetition I think it well to add Mr. H.'s\nnotes, taken at the time of his interview with the footman, as in these\ncases the questions are often almost as important as the answers.\nNovember 20th, 1893.\nThe servant without any questioning made the following statements :\u2014\nThere's a man standing by you now.\nHe's dressed in white, a kind of brown holland suit.\nHe's got a white turban on his head.\nHe isn't black and he isn't white. He's a kind of orange or Mulatto\ncolour\u2014a kind of dark yellow.\nHe's got dark whiskers and dark hair.\nHis lips are neither thick nor thin, but medium.\nHe looks at you very lovingly ; he knows you very well and stands very\nclose to you, so he must be intimate with you.\nI said : ' ' Does he wish to say anything to me ? What does he wish me\nto do?\"\nHe said : ' ' He wants you to study philosophy. He wishes you to inves\ntigate spiritualism.\"\n1 said : \" Does he wish me to go in for it deeply ? \"\nReply : \" He says, ' yes.' \"\nI said : \" Does he wish me to give up all my time to it 1 \"\nReply : \" He says, ' yes.' \"\nI said : ' ' Does he wish me to give up my profession for the purpose of\nstudying philosophy ? \"\nReply : \" He nods his head and says, 'yes'. He says, also, that you are\nvery impressionable, very easily impressed, and if you go by your impres\nsions (? intuitions) you won't go far wrong.\"\nThe letter which accompanies this, illustrates the difference between\nMr. H.'s point of view and mine,\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 129\n\" See if this does not alter your theory of the vision. How could two\ndifferent persons, one refined, educated, and well-connected like yourself,\nthe other a poor ignorant working-man, see precisely and absolutely the same\nsubjective vision, if there were no objective reality there ? Isn't the ' simple\ntruth ' hypothesis after all infinitely more simple ami scientific and credible\nthan all the fine-spun theories which seek to set aside the theory that the\nthing which we see first w that which it purports to be ? I have no intellectual\ndifficulty in taking the vision as a piece of genuine objective perception\nmade by means of a sixth sense or special power (latent perhaps in all),\nbut developed only in a few.\"\nI should perhaps state that I have sufficient reasons, into which\nhowever I need not enter at length, for believing that this was not,\nas might appear, a case of that inscrutable omniscience which usually\npervades the kitchen. I am as certain as one can be of anything, that\nby no normal means could this man have heard of the previous\nincident.\nI reminded Mr. H. of the probability that as his psychical experi\nments and experiences had been very few in number, it was likely that\nhis interview with me might, on the occasion r f his visit to a medium,\nsomewhat prominent in his mind, and that thought-transference\nmight account for the second description of the Hindoo. I have no\nmeans of deciding between the two interpretations.\nIII.\u2014I find it possible to distinguish between a vision of a living\nfriend and of one who has passed away, by reason of the greater con-\ncreteness of the phantasm of the living\u2014a perception, mental, perhaps,\nrather than sensuous ; but on very careful reflection, recollection, and\nanalogy, I can find no certain difference in kind between the thought\nimage\u2014the visualisation of an idea\u2014and the so-ealled \"spirit\";\nsuggesting that this, too, may be in certain cases the visualisation\nof an idea\u2014for myself a pregnant fact, infinitely suggestive. My\nown inclination is invariably to exhaust every possible normal,\neven every possible extension of natural explanation, before appealing\nto what we call the supernormal, and I ventured to urge this point\nupon my correspondent. He, however, assured me that he found\na \"straightforward spirit\" a much more thinkable hypothesis than\n\" an externalised visualisation of a symbolical idea subconsciously\nconceived \"; and though I may have my opinion on the case\nin point, \" I have no reason but a woman's reason \"\u2014\" I think\nit so because I think it so.\" Such things rest, unfortunately, but\ntoo often, on impressions too subtle for analysis, almost too subtle\nfor statement.\nA curious little incident, not the less suggestive and perplexing for\nits extreme triviality, occurred, also in connection with Mrs. T., while\nin Scotland last summer.\nM\n\f130 \"Miss X:\nWe were breakfasting alone, very early and somewhat hurriedly,\non the morning of August 10th, having planned to take the coach to\nGlencoe, when I suddenly perceived a little red man dangling in the\nair, a foot or two away from my friend, and remarked upon the fact.\nShe looked at the toast-rack and marmalade in front of her, and being\nused to odd statements on my part, asked \"What kind of a red man!\"\nAs he continued his dangling I was able to describe him in detail.\nHe was entirely red, and had the sort of outline of the little jointed\nivory figures one buys in the Soho Baazar. His arms were crooked\nabruptly upwards at the elbow, and he ceased a little above the knees.\nMrs. T. could suggest no explanation, and we went our way\nleaving him, so far as I know, still dangling from an invisible string.\nWe did not return till late in the afternoon, when Mrs. T., having\nentered the house first, met me as I came in at the front door, saying\n\" There's your red man ! \" and showed me a letter she had just\nreceived marked, Immediate\u2014To be forwarded, and sealed in red\nwax with the impress of precisely the figure I had described. The\nletter had arrived by the first post, shortly after our departure, and\nwas of consequence.\nWe have kept the seal, which, so far as I am aware, I had\nnever before seen, and Mrs. T. has written a separate account, as\nfollows :\u2014\n\"One morning at breakfast, (August 13th), during our Scotch tour,\nMiss X. said to me, ' I have a hallucination this morning of a little\nred man dancing about on the table ; he has no legs, and has one of his arms\ncrooked up in a funny fashion ; he has something to do with you, not me,\nas he keeps dancing about in front of you.' I could not account for the\nlittle red man in any way ; but in the evening I found among my letters\n(which had arrived after we had gone out in the morning) one of some\nconsequence, with a red seal, an impression of a man without legs, and\nholding a flag or sword in one hand.\"\nNo cudgelling of my brains or stirring up of my memory avails\nto contribute anything further. I simply saw the little red man, he\nsuggested no association, and I assigned him to my friend merely\nbecause he seemed to belong to her \" surroundings.\"\nOnce while we were out I observed a girl with a heraldic device\nin her hat, sitting next to the coachman in his red jacket. We\nspeculated as to the possibility of his correspondence with my vision.\nBut I felt at the time he wouldn't do.\nI should like, before passing on to another point, to illustrate what\nI have said as to the sense of abstraction which accompanies the image\nof one who has passed away.\nIt has happened to me many times, so vivid are these phenomena,\nto mistake a phantasm for a living person, for the moment, but only\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Message*. 131\nfor the moment. I believe that this is merely a consequence of my\nextreme slow-sightedness as, when the time sufficed, the mistake lias\nalways been corrected. If the vision has only sufficient duration I\nbecome conscious of its independence of my environment. In every\ncase that I am personally able to recall, the living phantasm brings\nwith it some hint of its own surroundings, of the things with which\nit has some real relation\u2014the dead seem to be abstracted from any\nsurroundings whatever.\nNow for my illustration. An old family friend, a very accom\nplished musician, had directed my musical studies from my earliest\nchildhood. He had a very highly strung, artistic temperament, yet,\nstrange to say, was an absolute Materialist. He was so closely associ\nated with my favourite study and my desire to please him by diligence\nand perseverance was so intense, that, when thoughts of music occupied\nrny mind, it was not remarkable that I should visualise my old friend\nat his piano or organ. And it was always definitely at Ata instrument.\nIf I fancied him at mine, a more careful observation would show that\nthe piano before him was his own favourite Broadwood. I would see\nhim, too, among the surroundings of the seaside home to which he had\nlately removed,which,though I have never seen it, seems quite familiar,\nand I was glad to find, on seeing a photograph of his studio only the\nother day, that I had correctly localised the old familiar furniture.\nOn the 5th May, 1893, I received a letter from his wife, in which\nshe said that both were getting old and feeble, but nothing of a nature\nmore alarming. On the 9th, one of my frequent pictures of my old\nfriend arose before me. He looked just as usual, with this difference,\nthe image bore no relation to anything else; it was, if I may so describe\nit, a vignette ; there was no piano or violin, and the sense of abstrac\ntion, before referred to, was very intense. To a friend, who endorses the\nstory, I remarked sadly that I knew my old friend was dead. I also\nentered the impression in my diary. The next day brought the sad\nnews. I do not think there was any time coincidence. My friend\nhad died at dawn, and my picture was formed about 9.30 a.m., three\nhours later. I have never classified this as \"a phantasm of the dead;\"\nit has rather seemed to me as if some sub-conscious knowledge of the\nfact, however obtained, served to modify a familiar act of visualisation,\nor, if we make thought-transference the basis of any theory of explan\nation, as if the seer were incapable of receiving an impression of the\nnew surroundings, as if the new atmosphere could not communicate\nitself, as if, let us say, my friend had become abstracted from time and\nspace and had no relation with the things which we call \" real.''\nStrange to say, I have lately had a similar monition of the\ndangerous illness of uay friend's wife. I give the story as noted\n\f132 \"Miss X.\"\n' ' On January 29th, X. and I were dressing to go [out] when I suddenly\nnoticed that her eyes were fixed on the window, in a manner I know\nwell and have long learned to associate with something ' uncanny. ' I\nwaited till her face regained its normal expression, and then asked what she\nhad seen or what she felt. She turned to the clock, and said in a dreamy\nfar-away tone, ' A quarter past 11 . I think Mrs. C. is dead or very ill.*\nThe next morning a letter telling of the dangerous illness of the lady\nin question reached X., from a relative,\u2014a very rare correspondent.\"\n[Signed by D.]\nMy old friend's illness was very sudden\u2014the result of a stroke of\nparalysis, but I cannot discover any time coincidence, unless it may\nbe that of the writing of the letter, as to which my correspondent\ncan only say, \" it was somewhere about the middle of the morning.\"\nAnd here I would say emphatically that there are two classes of\nphantasms (I use the word as less committal than \" spirits,\" for I do\nnot feel myself in a position to speak with certainty) two classes of\nphantasms, of which I am unable to speak from experience, the\nphantasm that is so concrete as to utilise furniture, remove tables and\noccupy chairs, and the phantasm that is so abstract as to be indepen\ndent of space, beyond whose person one may trace the pattern of the\nwall-paper.\nI offer another example of the possible explanation by thought-\ntransference of what at first sight might seem a vision of the\ndeparted.\nTwo years ago I was visiting in a country village, in which I\nhad spent much of my childhood. The constant companion of those\nearlier days was my friend M., who since my last visit had married,\ngone abroad and had died. So intensely was the thought of M. associated\nwith all my old haunts, and so complete had been during life our\npower of thought-transference, that a vision of my old friend in half a\nhundred spots would hardly have surprised me. Nothing, however, of\nthe sort occurred, until one day I was walking with a friend past a\nrow of houses built since my last visit, and towards which I felt only\nthe distaste of an old inhabitant for modern improvements. At the last\nhouse in the row I had a momentary vision of my friend M. As, of\ncourse, the sense of my friend's loss was very prominent in my con\nsciousness, I could not, with any fairness, analyse the impression, for it\nis obviously a case in which one would have to discount for expecta\ntion. It was, perhaps, the very last place in which such a vision might\nbe looked for, still I never for an instant mistook the figure for any\nother, brief as was the impression of its presence.\nA remark made to me the following day possibly explains the\nphenomenon. A sister of my deceased friend said to me, \"I want to take\nyou to call on the T.'s. They live in the end house in that row of new\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 133\nvillas,\" naming the place of niy vision, \" and would like to know you.\nThey are too old to call upon you, but M. used to be there so much that\nI think you -would like to meet them. They think they saw you pou\nthe bouse yesterday.\"\n'What more likely than that the thought of M., so prominent in\nseveral minds, should have thus taken shape, perhaps, in some such\nfashion as in a crystal picture. But I cannot tell.\nI have, so far, tried to express the effect upon the Subject of three\nstages of supernormal messages.\n(1.) The impulse to deliver a statement which seems to owe its\ngenesis to something apart from one's own consciousness, to be inde\npendent of reason or memory, perhaps analogous to the messages of\nclairaudience or automatic writing, but having no corresponding sense\nimpression, an elementary form possibly of the phenomenon known as\n\" trance utterance.\"\n(2.) The externalisation of an idea, a symbolic presentation of an\nimpresssion consciously or sub-consciously made.\n(3.) A definite sense hallucination, presenting some fact sub-con\nsciously acquired by thought-transference, clairvoyance, or other\nmeans.\nThese have all so much in common that to distinguish between\nthem is not easy and may be considered merely fanciful. But some\ntimes, as in the following case, a mind picture seems to contain all\nthree elements at once, and the analysis becomes more complex still.\nDuring the month of August 1893, we chanced to be staying in a\nsea-side village on the north coast of France. The hotel was so full\nthat we had to sleep in a little chalet at a short distance away. My\nown room was next to that of an English lady with whom I had\na slight acquantance, mainly on the basis that we were fellow-members\nof the S.P.R. But we had exchanged but few visits, and I had no\nacquaintance with any of her friends.\nOn August 11th, about 7.20 o'clock, I looked into her room on\nreturning from my afternoon bathe, to ask if she would walk with\nme up to the hotel for dinner. I found her lying on her bed, with her\nback to the window, and reading the newspaper. In place of the wall\nbehind her, I seemed to see the view of a sea-side watering-place\u2014a\nview quite different from that really visible through the window.\n'With this for a background, I saw a scene which will be shortly\ndescribed.\nI was naturally somewhat startled, and hardly knew in what\nwords I accounted for my visit ; but I left my friend very hastily\nand returned to my own room. I there wrote the following\nmemorandum in the few moments which I could spare before going\nup to our meal at the hotel.\n\f134 \"Miss X.\"\n\" Friday, August Uth, 1893.\n(A) \" I entered Mrs. T.'s room rather hurriedly this afternoon about 7.20\nto tell her that I was going up to the Hotel terrace, and found myself\nmomentarily confronted with a startling scene. She was resting on her bed,\nand the very limited space behind her seemed to have expanded so that I\nlooked straight onto the sea without the intervention of wall or window. It\nwas rather a sea than what lies before us here. Against this background a\nman was moving so that I saw his profile only. He was above average\nheight\u2014not young\u2014grey, with a moustache\u2014clear cut face\u2014very upright.\nAs he came near Mrs. T. he turned so as to face me, but my attention was\ndistracted at that point by the intervention of two other figures who seized\nhim from behind with gestures which somehow conveyed to me annoyance\nif not actual malice. These were two girls, perhaps between 18 and 25, but\nit is not quite safe to say. I saw only one distinctly; she was well outlined\n\u2014rather 'gentlemanly ' in her get up\u2014had a ' tailor-made ' air\u2014I rather\nthink a shirt, but if so it had a stiff front or a man's tie, and was not loose\nand soft. The other girl impressed me as the stronger, but whether mentally\nor physically I cannot say. The man was well groomed\u2014 dressed, I think,\nin grey. I did not see the girls' faces.\"\nWhile at table, I told my friend that a wish she had chanced\nto express that something of psychical interest would happen during\nher visit seemed to have been fulfilled, but without describing the\ncircumstances, which we agreed she had better have in writing.\nWe further agreed that in view of the possibility of some further\ndevelopment, it would be better that we should exchange no ideas\nor information upon the subject. On our return to the chalet, T\npresented her with my memorandum. She expressed great interest,\nbut did not tell me to what extent the vision was veridical, beyond\nthe remark that though the description of the gentleman, was almost\nexact, she felt tolerably sure that he had not a suit of the colour\nI described.\nThe next morning I was alone in my room, turning over in my\nmind the details of my vision, when suddenly the whole scene re\nappeared. For the first moment, I was inclined to feel that this was\nonly a visualised memory, occurring as it might have done in a picture\nin the crystal. But I soon perceived that it was something more, as.\nthe story received new additions, which I at once described in writ\ning, of which the following is a copy :\u2014\n(B) \"Saturday, 11.40. Sometimes if I wait without seeking for informa\ntion I get my visions repeated with additions\u2014a recrudescent memory, a*\nT believe, involving some facts unnoticed at the moment. I have now\ndiscovered the name of one of the two girls. As I was noting down\nyesterday's events in my diary the whole scene was reproduced in a flash\nwith the addition that the man on being held back shouted ' Aimee I\nAimee ! ' \" [The real name being one which, as to the peculiarity of its.\nfinals, corresponds with this.]\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 135\nEarly next morning I slipped this memorandum under the door of\nmy friend's room, calling her attention to it, with the remark, \" I have\nfound out the name of one of those girls.'' When we next met, my\nfriend expressed increased interest in the story, but again offered me\nno information. During the day, however, she put into my hands a\nease containing photographs, calling my attention to the portrait of a\nfriend of whom we had had occasion to speak a few days before. I at\nonce exclaimed, pointing to another portrait near it, \" Why, that's\nthe ghost; and a very good likeness, too.\" She then told me that she\nhad had all along little doubt that this gentleman, her friend, Admiral\nZ., [whose real name and title I am not permitted to give,\u2014a man of\ndistinction in one of the Services] was the original of my picture ;\nthat the two girls in question were his daughters, but they were\nunknown to her, and that she could not at all explain the details in\nmy vision which had seemed to express some enmity towards her on\ntheir part.\nI now add Mrs. T.'s remarks upon the incident.\n\"Miss X. has asked me to give an account of a curious incident in which\nI was the agent. I was lying in my room after bathing, reading the Daily\nTelt'\/raph, and my thoughts entirely centred on the article which I was\nperusing. I heard a knock at my door, and on my saying 'Come in,'\nMiss X. entered to tell me that she was going up to the terrace of the hotel,\nat the same time remarking that I was very flushed, which, I said, I attri\nbuted to the bath. During dinner, about half an hour afterwards, she\nsaid 'I saw something extraordinary in your room just now,' and on my\nexpressing astonishment she told me the following strange story which I\ncannot do better than give in her own words as she kindly wrote it out for\nme that evening.\n[See A. ante.]\n\"I was much impressed, as all the figures were so distinctly described\nthat I could, without hesitation, recognise every one of them. I purposely\ngave Miss X. no hint which could in any way guide her to a solution of\nthe meaning of this curious vision.\n\"The next morning while I was dressing she pushed under the door the\nfollowing, at the same time saying ' I have discovered the name of one of\nthe girls. '\n[See B. ante.]\n\"Now this is to me most interesting, as my second name was Aimee, and I\nhave never in my life been called by that name except by the man in the\nvision ; and on my asking Miss X. why she wrote the name with ee instead\nof the more usual y, she replied ' because it impressed me as being written\nthus.' I never sign this second name except to official documents, and she\ncould not possibly have known that it was my name.my first [which is here\ngiven as Esther], of course being well known to her.\"\n[Mrs. T. does not even use her second initial.]\n\f1 \"Miss X.\"\nThe next chapter in the story was as follows :\u2014\nOn Monday the 14th of August, we were at a hotel in Rouen, and\nat table d'h6te I was seated next to my English friend, Mrs. T. ; and\nin conversation, she referred, but without naming him, to the Admiral,\nand without touching upon the incident which had introduced him to\nme. As she spoke, I happened to be twisting round with my fingers a\ntall goblet of Chablis, into which I was idly gazing. As I looked, there\nformed upon tl a surface of the glass the following words, in long,\nnarrow letters.! \u2014\n\" Aimee is Esther ; the one who speaks is Kate.\"\nI read the message aloud to my friend, who at once exclaimed :\n\" Now you know. It is quite true that I, Esther, am Aim\u00e9e. The\nname properly belongs to me, but it is one which I never use, and never\nemploy in my signature, and never hear except from the lips of this one\nparticular friend, the Admiral. It is also true that one of the girls is\ncalled Kate.\"\nA curious detail in regard to this point is that the name which I\nhavA given as \"Kate\" is also my own name, which may complicate the\nquestion as to the real meaning of the message. I am inclined to\nthink that it relates to one of the girls, as I can conceive of no reason\nfor informing me of my own actions.\nWe both agreed that this message was of a particularly perplexing\nkind, as I had all along supposed that the cry, \" Aimee, Aimee,\"\nreferred not to my friend, Esther, but to the Admiral's daughter.\nOn the suggestion that I might perhaps see something more, I\nagain gazed into my goblet, when at once the following picture\nappeared : \u2014\n[I quote the account written the same evening and which has been\npreserved (with A and B) by Mrs. T.]\n\" Monday Evening, August 14<7i.\n\" While at table d'hote engaged in conversation with Mrs. T. (not having\nany obvious bearing on what followed) I chanced to look into my goblet of\nChablis and there read in type of the following proportions [Here I repro\nduced the letters as exactly as I could] :\u2014\n\" ' Aimee is Esther ; the one who speaks is Kate.'\n\"This passed away, and was succeeded by a picture not so clear as before\nich I cannot recall except as a memory\u2014that is, I can revive the\nssion, but not visualise the scene\u2014A long row of houses of the sea-side\nhouse type\u2014in front a road\u2014beyond, a long low building\u2014an\nanade, and below the sea\u2014at the door of the building stands the same\nan as before\u2014the right hand in his pocket, looking straight out before him\n^-perhaps it is not a door\u2014I saw the upright lines behind him\u2014 it may be\nwindow\u2014it faces the sea.\"\nMy friend was quite unable to say whether this vision were or\nwere not likely to be true, as the place at which the Admiral was\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 137\nstaying was one she had never seen ; but she took an early opDortunity\nof sending him a description of the incident, and two or three days\nafter, she read me his reply.\nI add some further notes of Mrs. T.'s on the story.\n\" I must here state that my conversation at that moment was with\nreference to the man in the vision, although unknown to Miss X., and my\nthoughts apparently called up these names in the glass as if to tell her to\nwhom I was alluding. i\n\" On writing to tell my friend of this vision, in re, 'y ho says ' the\ndescription Miss X. gives of the house does not correspond with the house I\nam living in, but does to a great extent with the club from which I always\nwrite\u2014it is on the sea front with a road in front\u2014then the esplanade and\nsea\u2014and I often stand at the door or bay window and look out across the\nsea.'\n\" One or two points are interesting as regards the first vision. I said to\nMiss X. ' you are wrong about the colour of the clothes the man was wearing,\nas he only has a brown suit with him.' In reply to my query to him on the\nsubject, he writes ' I had worn a grey suit that morning, and a brown one\nin the afternoon, but at 7.15 o'clock I must have been dressed for dinner,\u2014\nthe girls had on' serge dresses with silk fronts, not shirts, (as they were\ngoing out for a sail after dinner) ; they often wear in the day-time stiff\nshirts with ties.' \"\nIt seems to me that this story contains, as to the source of the\nmessages, varied and conflicting elements. The figure of the Admiral\nmight perhaps be traced to thought-transference from my companion;\nbut as the figures of the girls\u2014unknown to her\u2014may be regarded as\n\"part of his surroundings,\" whatever that phrase may mean, it would\nseem more simple to consider both elements in my vision as purely\nclairvoyant. In either case, the picture may be regarded as belonging\nto Class III. But supposing it to be clairvoyant\u2014that I really did\nsee the man and his daughters\u2014how shall we account for the irruption\nof that part of it which was not literally true, though to me quite as\nreal and vivid as any other\u2014the action of the girls in withdrawing\ntheir father from my friend's influence ?\nThis can only be taken as symbolic, as belonging to Class II., the\nvisualisation of an idea. How far the idea was of my own conception\nit would be difficult to say.\nThen the explanatory message seen in the glass of Chablis\u2014whose\nmind gave birth to this? Is not this, although more externalise^Bfc\nthe same class as the impulse to say things which our minds h;iv|H,lt\nconsciously conceived ?\nThe vision of the Admiral standing at his club window\u2014 which\nwas literally coincident\u2014one would explain without hesitation as\nthought-transference, except for the fact that if we admit clairvoy\nance in the former case, one does not see why it should be exckided\n\f138 \"Miss X.\nin the other, just because another and simpler hypothesis would fit\nthe circumstances equally well.\nOn the theory that one's intuitions and premonitions and the like\nare messages from one's sub-conscious self to the self of one's ordinary\nconsciousness, it is instructive to note that one's sub-consciousness\noccasionally appears to regard things from a somewhat different stand\npoint from that of the ordinary consciousness, to present important\nfacts in an aspect which makes them seem to us unimportant, to\nexternalise only some trifling accessory in an interesting picture, and\nto misrepresent, and often exaggerate one's emotions. Why, for\nexample, should it not be as easy to see the contents of an important\nletter as to see the (equally unknown) device upon its seal ?\nWhy, if it were needful to offer warning against a new acquaint\nance, should the veil be lifted from a scene of his boyhood, dis\ngraceful enough it is true, but a far less practically useful warning\nthan a glimpse of his contemporary mis-doings, which might\nhave saved those belonging to him from much subsequent misery 1\nWhy, again, should we be subjected to what I may describe as fictitious\nemotion, as in the following example ?\nOn Tuesday last, January 22nd, I was, as is my custom, occupied\nwith my books before rising. I had been reading for perhaps an hour\nand was vaguely conscious that there were movements about the\nhouse. I was reading \" Love's Labour Lost,\" and had paused to\nvisualise the second scene between Moth and Armado in the full\nabsurdity of its detail. Suddenly, just as one scene succeeds another\nin the crystal, the picture I had conjured up disappeared, and gave\nplace to that of the village street of my northern home. But, as often\nin dreams, the scene was historically inaccurate, for not only were\nthere the rough stone cottages thatched with ling, of my childhood's\ndays, with one of which (in my picture, especially visible) the abode of\nan old servant, I was very familiar, but also part of the block of\nhandsome stone buildings by which they have been lately displaced,\nand in which a very intimate friend chances to have his offices.\nTogether with the picture, there flashed upon me a sense of loss\nand distress, which, as I gazed, took possession of my whole being.\nTears sprang to my eyes, and I felt that I knew that something\nsorrowful had occurred, though of what nature I could not recall.\nThe impression was as if left by forgotten knowledge, not a forecast of\nthe future, the sort of distress with which one awakes from a forgotten\ndream. A moment later, hearing the steps of the maid, and the\nclink of the tea-cup outside, I extinguished the lamp to give me time\nto recover from my too obvious distress. She re-lighted the lamp\nand handed me with my tea a letter which I at once perceived was\nfrom a sister of this friend. I opened it with increasing apprehension,\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 139\nfor, as I had heard from her but a few days before, I felt sure she\nmust have some special reason for writing. The letter was to tell\nDie that our dear old servant, who formerly lived in the cottage of my\nvision and whom I had known all my life, hail died suddenly, and\nthat my friends had just returned from the funeral service.\nIt is an ungracious task to measure one's regrets and affections, but,\nas so often happens in the case of being \" prepared \" for a shock, the\nprevious emotion was in excess of that which the news itself would\nhave occasioned.\nCertainly, whatever the source of such messages, there is about them\na distinct lack of the sense of proportion in time, space, and degree.\nIn the case just quoted, the superfluous emotion did not certainly\ncome from the friend who communicated the news, for her interest\nin the old servant had been largely for my sake. So far as I can tell\nin looking back, I went through none of the natural consecutive pro\ncesses of reasoning which might lead from a vague sense of something\nwrong in a certain village to association of the fear with those\ndearest to me in the neighbourhood, dread as to what that might\ninclude, and terror of the worst. I am perfectly clear that I siiw\nboth dwellings at once,\u2014the sites of the two being not fifty yards\napart.\nThere are many cases of this kind which do not admit of being\nrecorded before the coincidence is known, and which must therefore\nrest on my personal veracity and be judged accordingly. This may be\nsaid also of the following incident, in itself trifling, but which I quote\nas a further illustration of the queer way in which one seizes upon an\naccessory, rather than the more important item in an incident. I was\ndriving home in the afternoon of January 14th. My cab was checked\nat a street corner, and I noticed that we were passing an oyster shop.\nSuddenly I knew that my friend E. was sending some oysters to an old\ngentleman we know who is ill. I looked at the time,\u20144.20\u2014and\nthough I had not the smallest reason to suppose E. had ever thought\nof doing such a thing I felt no doubt as to the fact. I fully intended to\nnote it down on my return, but unluckily forgot all about it till next day,\nwhen I heard D., my invalid friend's daughter, sending a message of\nthanks for some oysters sent by another friend, not E. E., however,\nwas present and I turned to her and said, \" You ought to have sent\nthose oysters, I saw you doing it yesterday afternoon at 4.20.\"\n\"That was the very time they were being sent off,\" she answered,.\n\" and though they were Mr. J.'s present, I ordered and sent them at\nhis request.\"\nPresumably the motive force in any act is the initiation of that act.\nMr. .J. had never sent my friend a present before in his life, and, in\ndeed, knew him very slightly ; such impetus as the act might receive\n\f140 \"Miss X:\nfrom its novelty and his initiation ought, one would naturally suppose,\nto have been accompanied by the idea of Mr. J., and yet such idea failed\nto reach me, while the more familiar and commonplace one of E. did\nits work.\nIn receiving messages of this kind, I always feel that a main point\nis to preserve them from admixture with the ordinary stratum of con\nsciousness ; otherwise they become, in point of psychological interest,\nas dreams at the moment of waking to deep-sleep dreams. As soon as\nI begin to reason about an impression, I begin to distrust it. Con\nstantly, in trying to receive psychometric impressions, I find that\nhaving dismissed my first impulse as too improbable I am reduced to\nmere guessing and all interest is lost. So I think it a good rule to say\n'whatever comes into my head on such occasions. For instance, D. has\nnoted down the following : \" December 24th, I showed [X] Aunt E 's\nlittle box to-day,and said ' you may have the contents of this if you can\nsee them through the lid.' She answered, ' Then I certainly shan't\nget them, for what I see is not likely to be in a box of that sort' [a card\nboard two-inch cube, coloured to look like oak]. ' What do you see 1 '\n' Wedding cake.' In point of fact the box contained a miniature\nplum-pudding in a toy basin.\" I am perfectly aware that whereas my\nfirst (and approximately correct) impression seemed to my reasoning\nfaculties absurd, the second article I visualised,\u2014a memory of recent\nshopping, an inkstand shaped like a cricket ball,\u2014was far more wide\nof the mark.\nI do not apologise for the triviality of the experiences quoted.\nWere they of a more startling character they would lend themselves\nless easily to comment, either now or at the time of their occurrence.\nWhat I feel to be, from the critical stand-point, far more important, is\ntheir numerical frequency, and the relation of success to failure.\nFor about five years I have tried to keep a diary of such things.\nI have aimed at writing down premonitions before their coincidence\nwas known\u2014noting cases of thought-transference, retro-cognition,\npsychometry, intuition of all kinds. I am conscious, as most people\nare who attempt to keep diaries, of unlimited omissions ; but so far as\nthe entries go, I think they have been kept with exactness, and I may\npoint out that, as I have exercised no selection as to entries, as I\nhave omitted cases because I forgot them, or because the book was not\nat hand, or the occasion not convenient for writing, not because\nthey were not good, such omissions tell against me, and not in my\nfavour\u2014which I note with satisfaction.\nI am certainly within the mark in saying that I have noted less\nthan one-third of the total of experiences of this kind. I ought to\nsay, too, that I never note pictures which spring from fancy and recru-\ndescent memory which I recognise as such at the time, nor pictures\n\fOn the Apparent Souixes of Subliminal Messages. 141\nwhich I put in the crystal, unless they develop in some unexpected\ndirection. Such things are obviously not worth recording, as any one\ncapable of visualisation can create them indefinitely at will. They\nare like half the novels one reads, amusing for the moment, occasionally\nsuggestive, but mere pastime and not worth remembering.\nI have omitted, too, certain cases which, for various reasons, have\nfound record elsewhere,\u2014as for instance, when any friend concerned in\nthe experience has asked for a written account of it and it has not\nseemed to me worth while to repeat the memorandum. Further, I\nought to explain that an entry may include half a dozen pictures or\nimpressions, provided they relate to the same subject and occur on the\nsame or a not distant occasion. For example, the whole story of Mrs.\nT. and the Admiral is recorded under one heading, and comes in first\nas \"Number 31 \" and then as \" 31, continued, see above.\"\nPerhaps one year's records may be taken as typical; 1894 has\ngiven, as far as I can judge, a good average ; better, I think, than\n1893 ; not so good as the two previous.\nAll the above details being allowed for, I classify my record for\n1894 as follows :\u2014\n(a) 19 cases good.\n(b) 5 \u201e bad.\n(c) 27 \u201e imperfect.\n(d) 7 \u201e unexplained.\n(\u00ab) 5 \u201e incomplete.\n(a) The classification \"good\" does not refer to the quality of the\nmessage but only to its accuracy. The \" little red man,\" for example,\nis very trivial, but as far as it goes it is correct ; this, and \" Clara\nStimpson,\" and \" Frances at Eastbourne,\" and \" The Admiral \" series,\nthough differing in quality, I should classify alike as \" good,\" because\nthey contain no element of doubt.\n(6) I classify as bad such impressions as seem to have no founda\ntion in fact, as for instance, when I picture a friend as in trouble, who,\nin point of fact, is in average spirits, and the like. I am inclined to\nbelieve that nearly all such cases are due to the irruption into an im\nperfect, or imperfectly understood, experience of the ordinary\nconsciousness. Of course in certain cases there is another obvious\nexplanation, that a friend may have transmitted the impression of a\npassing mood or sensation, keen enough for the moment, but forgotten\nin looking back, when questioned, on the day's general complexion.\nTwo cases originally classified as bad, I have since changed to \" imper\nfect \" on discovering that I had been intentionally misled by the person\nto whom they referred. One of these is, I believe, were the evidence\ncomplete, really a yood case, but I leave it, at present, as imperfect.\n\f142 Miss X.\"\n(e) I classify as imperfect all such cases as are only partly good,\u2014\nlike the \"plum-pudding\" story. It occasionally happens that a case\nat first imperfect becomes good in process of time.\n(d) The class unexplained includes such stories as the Hindoo and\nMr. H., which is neither right nor wrong but, as far as we know,\nmeaningless. I was at first disposed to classify these as subjective, but\nI am inclined now to think that inadequate, perhaps unfair.\n(e) The cases classified as incomplete are those as to which the\nevidence is too imperfect to admit of any conclusion being drawn,which\nit would be unjust to relegate to the bad, but which, for lack of precise\ninformation, I am unable to classify more precisely.\nI will not further multiply examples which are the more tedious\nbecause their principal point lies in the minuteness of their differences.\nI have perhaps made it apparent how difficult it may be for even the\nrecipient of supernormal messages to speak with any certainty as to\ntheir source. I should like to sum up, as possibly suggestive of com\nparison to others of wider and more startling experience than my\nown, the very few conclusions which I have been able to deduce from\nmy own observation of apparently supernormal messages, which, I may\nremark, have been tolerably frequent during my whole life, and which\nI have now observed very carefully for about seven years.\n(1.) I find it quite impossible to mistake the intention of any figure\nwhich has ever appeared to me at the moment of death, although these\nfigures have, I think, in all cases, presented their usual appearance.\n(2.) I think also that,when the glimpse has been more than momen\ntary (and again I would emphasise the fact of my slow-sightedness), I\nhave never, even in the case of strangers, mistaken a vision of a\ndeceased person for that of one still living.\nIn both cases I am speaking of the kind of vision which we call\nclairvoyant\u2014which it is difficult to trace to the mind of any one living,\nor to any memory or observation of my own. In both there is a strong\nsense-impression of abstractedness to which I have before referred ; in\nthe former case this, naturally, is further accentuated by the emotion or\nshock which accompanies it.\n(3.) But things become more complex when this sense of abstracted\nness is carried\u2014as in the case of the Hindoo\u2014into pictures of the kind\nwhich seem to me to be externalisations of an idea. If the idea,\nwhether born in my own mind or communicated from that of another,\ndoes not include any surrounding circumstance, the figure will be \" a\nvignette,\" having no relation to things about it, standing or walking\npossibly in the air, owning none of the usual conditions of time and\nspace.\n\fOn the Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages. 143\n(4.) But if, on the other hand, the mind in which the picture\noriginates further conceives the surroundings, these too will be\npresented. Then the vision will fall under one of two groups :\u2014\n(a.) The picture may be thought of as in definite, distant surround\nings, so that the seer, while walking in a London street, may see a\nfriend seated at a dinner table at ten o'clock in the morning. A vision\nof this sort is difficult to distinguish from \" clairvoyance,\" and it is\nconstantly so mis-called, just as any subjective hearing of voices is mis\ncalled \" clairaudience.\" I admit the frequent difficulty of distinction.\nHappily, we have usually the obvious ground of coincidence, the com\nparison of time, place, and contents of message.\n(b.) The figure may be thought of as having relation to my surround\nings, so that I may see a friend, who has pictured himself as calling on\nme, in the act of lifting the latch of my garden gate. This is an\ninstance when a hallucinatory figure may be excusably mistaken\u2014as\nfrequently happens\u2014for a real one.\nIn all subjective analysis and observation of this kind, there are\ntwo constantly recurring difficulties, both of which have to be\nreckoned with\u2014the element of surprise and the element of expectation.\nEach is in its way a serious interruption\u2014the shock which partially\nunnerves, the antecedent knowledge or apprehension which over-\nstimulates the activities, so that discrimination between what we see\nand what we think we see adds another feature to the problem of\nexact observation.\nIt must be a very hardened observer indeed, who does not feel\nsome degree of emotion, whatever its kind, however familiar its\noccurrence, at the sudden extension of one's purview ; and it is, in\nmany cases, only afterwards that one analyses the brief impression.\nThis, inevitable as it is, emphasises the importance of deducing no\nrule from a single, or even from a few examples. It is so easy, and\nyet bo fatal, to read back the proof of any theory one is anxious\nto establish.\nOn the other hand, expectation too is a serious pitfall, far more\nserious, I believe, than we are ready to realise. The question is\nnot one upon which time will permit me to enlarge ; but I believe\nthat the extreme difficulty which has beset all my mechanical\nexperiments in crystal-gazing is to be found equally, though less obvi\nously, in every analysis of sense-impression. There is the difficulty\nof tense, of, so to speak, physical expectation, and the difficulty of\nmental expectation, this last being both conscious and sub-conscious.\nIn the above illustrations, T have tried to select some which\nseemed free from these especial complications, the importance of which\nI think will be readily conceded.\n\f144 \"Miss X.\"\nThere is one danger of which I say nothing, because, in truth, I\nknow nothing of it\u2014the alleged danger to health of mind or body.\nFor myself, I am perfectly healthy ; accustomed to an active life spent,\nin great part, in the country; riding, walking, or gardening, a lover of\nanimals, flowers, and country pleasures.

Berlin, 1894.\nMembers have no doubt noticed the satisfactory progress which is being\nmade by the Library, and how especially the \" Edmund Gurney \" portion\nof it is being continually increased by the addition of new books on\npsychology and allied subjects. Works on hypnotism form the largest\nportion of the recent acquisitions, and the bulk of these are written by\nphysicians and deal mainly with the subject as a method of treating\ndisease. They are therefore outside the scope of the Society's Proceedings\nexcept so far as they contain matters of general interest.\n(1). Among the most recent and most important of these is Psycho-\nThirapie, by Drs. van Renterghem and van Eeden, of Amsterdam. These\nphysicians have used hypnotism extensively in their clinique since 1887, and\ntheir book is an exposition of their experience.\nIn their interesting introductory chapter, they enter into an explanation\nof psycho-therapeutics, and contrast the method of treating diseased\nstates by suggestion and by drugs. In the former case they claim, as do\nLiebeault and Bernheim, that we go at once to the root of the matter, and\nby stimulating the ideo-motor centres in the brain attack the disease from\nK\n\f146 ISupplement.\nRevieivs.\nits starting-point or centre, instead of from the periphery, as when drugs\nare used.\nThe end aimed at by all treatment is to influence the plasma or\nformative material of the body, but this can be done more naturally and\nefficaciously, they think, by suggestion than by drugs. It is impossible,\nthey admit, to increase the initial vital energy, which is a matter of\ninheritance, but the existing supply of vital energy may be stimulated and\ndirected into proper channels by appropriate treatment. Man is not a\nmachine which merely requires supplying with a certain quantity of fuel to\nreplace waste of energy. He differs from a machine especially in that\nhe possesses a fund of energy upon which he can draw for the wants of the\norganism. It is the direction and management of this fund which the\nauthors consider the most important function of the physician, and the\none which suggestion enables him to exercise to the greatest advantage.\nThey give detailed reports of a number of their cases, and a tabulated\nstatement of the malady for which each patient was treated, his degree of\nsusceptibility to hypnotism, and the result attained.\nThe number of persons who presented themselves for treatment was\n1089, and of these 58, or 5'33 per cent., proved insusceptible to hypnotism,\nand 120, or 11 -61 per cent., were affected to the extent of somnambulism,\ncharacterised by amnesia, or loss of memory on waking of what was said\nor done during the hypnotic state. The remaining 82 per cent. were\ninfluenced in varying degrees, from slight drowsiness or heaviness to\nprofound sleep, which just fell short of somnambulism. The authors\nexpress themselves satisfied with the curative results obtained, and\nemphatically assert that in no case have untoward results followed the\ntreatment.\nThe book is so clearly and candidly written that its effect upon the\nreader must be convincing. Drs. van R\u00abnterghem and van Eeden have\nearned especially the gratitude of the medical profession by this exposition\nof five years' carefully detailed experience, and no doubt their labours will\nbe recognised and rewarded. In fact, indications are apparent everywhere\nthat medical men are awaking to the important part played by suggestion in\nall methods of treatment.\n(2). Dr. Mesnet's book is written from a medico-legal standpoint. He\nhas closely studied the phenomena of profound hypnosis in neurotic patients\nin the wards of the Hotel Dieu in Paris, of which he is Senior Physician.\nHe comes to the same conclusion as Bernheim and Liegeois, of Nancy,\nthat these highly sensitive subjects can be absolutely dominated by the\nhypnotist, and could be subjected to ill-treatment, made to sign documents,\nand impelled to commit crimes by hypnotic suggestion. He cites several\ntest cases in support of his views, and urges consideration of the matter on\nmedical men and jurists.\nDr. Mesnet has made a special study of that phase of somnambulism\ntermed fascination, in which the subject is hypnotised by gazing into the\neyes of the hypnotist or at a bright object. In this state, as has been\ndemonstrated by previous investigators, the higher brain functions seem\nentirely suspended, and the subject simply follows the object which has\nfascinated him without consciousness or volition.\n\fSupplement.I 147\nReviews.\nThe condition sometimes occurs spontaneously, as in a case reported by\nDr. Mesnet. One of his colleagues was called to attend a station-master\nwho had been fatally injured by a locomotive. The poor man expressed\nhimself completely ignorant of how he got on the line, but witnesses proved\nthat he had advanced to meet an in-coming train, and had appeared\ndetermined to have it run over him. Further evidence showed that he had\nfrequently suffered from catalyptic seizures and temporary loss of conscious\nness when suddenly confronted with a flashing surface. Similar cases have\nbeen reported by other physicians, and it is possible that some deaths which\nlook like suicide may be due to attacks of spontaneous fascination.\nDr. Mesnet relates some interesting cases of spontaneous somnambulism\nwhich he was able to convert into the hypnotic equivalent by making\nsuggestions at the moment the patient was waking to a normal condition,\nthus demonstrating the practical identity of the two states.\nHis endeavours to hypnotise his most sensitive patients from a distance\nhave not convinced him of the possibility of this procedure, and he has\nhad none but negative results in his experiments in thought-transference\nand clairvoyance.\n(3). Dr. Crocq, of Brussels, also discusses hypnotism, chiefly in its\nmedico-legal aspects. Though he agrees with Dr. Mesnet and others of\nthe Nancy School, that the power of suggestion in profound hypnosis is so\ngreat that the patient's scruples miy be overcome by repeated and energetic\nsuggestions, yet he thinks criminals will find, if they attempt to use\nhypnotism to effect their ends, that they will be betrayed by it, for the\nmemory is very likely to be revived by properly applied suggestions. Dr.\nCrocq has also made a considerable number of experiments with a view to\nobtaining hypnosis when at a distance from the subject, but he has not\nbeen successful, and we are justified therefore in continuing to hold that\nthis is only possible, if at all, in a very small proportion of the most\nsensitive subjects.\n(4). It appears that the practice of hypnotism has been forbidden, even\nto medical men, in Russia by the state authorities. Physicians who were\ninterested in the medical use of hypnotism, and who looked upon this\ninterference as uncalled for, appealed to their brethren throughout Europe\nto send a protest to the Russian Government, with a view to getting the\nprohibition removed. We do not know whether this effect has followed\nthe petition, but the situation has produced a very interesting volume, and\none which is probably unique in the history of medical literature. It\n.contains articles written by thirty well-known physicians in German,\nEnglish, French and Italian. The writers were asked to express their views\nwith regard to the utility of hypnotism, its dangers, and the steps they\nwould recommend for its regulation ; and the result is this collection of\nessays.\n(5). Dr. Russell Sturgis, a well-known physician of Boston, has published\na pamphlet on the use of hypnotism in the first degree for removing fixed\nideas and conditions of ill-health starting from nervous or moral shock.\nHis views, which are illustrated by cases, bear out the experiences of\nProfessor Janet and other physicians who are endeavouring to demonstrate\nn 2\n\f148 ISupplement.\nReviews.\nthe importance of the psychical factor in disease. One of Dr. Sturgis's\ncases is that of a lady who had for many years suffered from sleepless\nness, neuralgia and general loss of health. It was some time before she told\nDr. Sturgis of the starting point of her illness, which dated from the\nsudden death of her invalid father, to whom she had spoken angrily shortly\nbefore he died. She had become impressed with the idea that he had died\nwithout forgiving her, and this so preyed upon her mind that her health\ngradually broke down. Dr. Sturgis was able by hypnotic suggestion to\nremove the morbid idea, and the patient rapidly recovered.\n(6). In The Elements of Hypnotism, a young writer, Mr. R. Harry Vincent,\nhas produced a useful and interesting rtsnme of the subject, illustrated by\nmany original experiments. While an undergraduate at Oxford, he\nhypnotised a number of his college friends, both dons and undergraduates.\nHe found, as did Mr. Hugh Wingfield at Cambridge, that undergraduates\nare, as a rule, excellent subjects. As these young men may be said to\nrepresent the pick of the country, this fact is sufficient to dispose of the\nassertion that one still hears at times, that only persons of a low order\nof intellect are hypnotisable. Mr. Vincent gives some remarkable instances\nof the readiness with which sensory hyperesthesia is produced by\nsuggestion during hypnosis. For example, \"A number of persons each\ntake in their hands some small object, such as a penknife or coin. While the\nsubject is still out of the room, these articles are placed on the table and the\nsubject is brought in. He takes up the first object, smells it, and then\nsmells the hands of the various persons till he comes to the owner of the\nobject, when he leaves it in his or her hand, and so on until he has settled\nthe ownership of all the articles placed on the table.\" To show the effect\nof suggestion in heightening the power of memory, Mr. Vincent quotes the\ncase of a friend of his who was in for an examination in history, and was\nunable to remember dates. He asked Mr. Vincent to hypnotise him, and\nsuggest improved memory. The experiment proved so successful that\nthe candidate passed a good examination and found himself able to\nremember columns of dates after reading them over a few times. Mr.\nVincent adds that the effect has continued. The latter part of the volume\nis devoted to experiments on animals, and these are illustrated from\nphotographs. Mr. Vincent finds he is able to hypnotise many small animals,\nsuch as birds, frogs, snakes and lizards, by monotonous excitation of special\nnerves. He has one pet toad which becomes almost immediately cataleptic\nwhen he strokes its back, and continues so for three or four minutes. Mr.\nVincent is perhaps rather too ready to accept Professor Bernheim's dictum\nthat suggestion explains all the phenomena of hypnotism, and to ridicule\nother theories ; but the book is thoroughly readable, and can be recommended\nto the lay reader who desires to learn something of hypnotism and of the\nmodern views concerning it.\n(7). Dr. von Schrenk-Notzing's latest contributions are almost exclusively\nof medical interest ; and the same may be said of (8) the excellent little\nvolume Die Psycho-therapie ; ihre Handhabimg und Bedeutnng, by a new\nwriter, Dr. Tatzel of Essen, who has studied under Dr. Wetterstrand of\nStockholm, to whom he dedicates the work.\nChas.

With numerous illustrations.\nLondon, Walter Scott, Limited, 24, Warwick-lane, 1894. Charlns Scrib-\nner's Sons, 743-5, Broadway, New York. (The Vontempvrary Science\nSeries, No. xxvi. )\nMr. Podmore tells us in his preface that he aims \" at presenting in\nbrief compass a selection of the evidence upon which the hypothesis of\nthought-transference, or telepathy, is based.\" For his material he has\ndrawn upon the Phantasms of the Living, the Proceedings of the Societyfor\nPsychical Research, the unpublished records of the same Society, and many\nother sources. The conclusions to which he aims to bring his readers are, he\nthinks, in substantial agreement with those of the representative workers of\nthe Society, \"yet,\" he says, \"I have no claim to represent\" that Society,\n\" nor right to cloak my shortcomings with the authority of others.\"\nMr. Podmore's book will receive a warm welcome at the hands of all\nthose who are interested in this line of work. We have long felt the need\nof just such a book,\u2014a book that would put before the world in accessible\nform some small part of the evidence for telepathy that has accumulated in\nthe last few years, and would thus serve as a stimulus to further\nobservation and experimentation. Probably no living man is better fitted\nto undertake such a task than Mr. Podmore, and the book will meet this\nwant most admirably. His many years of experience in dealing with such\nproblems, his thorough acquaintance with what has been done in the field,\nhis cautious temper and his uniform candour are known to all who have\nprofited by his work in the past. The present writer feels no little\nhesitation in venturing to criticise the policy of such a veteran as Mr.\nPodmore. No one can say to what extent his own judgment is warped by\ntendencies to believe inherited from his cave-dwelling ancestors, and 1 am\naware that some of the remarks which I shall make, which indeed seem to\nme to be based upon metaphysical speculations of recent origin, may be\ninspired by latent animistic tendencies long since formally exiled from the\ncompany of my accredited beliefs. Yet, even with such a dire possibility\nconfronting me, I shall make bold to write the impression which the book\nmakes upon me.\nMr. Podmore is cautious to the verge of conservatism. All will agree\nthat any accepted theory should be somewhat strained to account for new\nfacts, before we either confess ignorance or resort to new theories, but\nopinions will vary as to the exact point at which such straining ceases to be\na virtue, and, by impeding the freedom of speculation, becomes a bar to\nfurther progress. In the first half of his book, Mr. Podmore seeks,\nand very successfully, to establish a theory ; in the second, he strains it to\naccount for phenomena which, I think, can be brought under it only by a\n*eries of more or less violent assumptions. It is to these assumptions that\nI wish chiefly to attract attention.\nThe thesis which the book is designed to establish is thus stated on page\n6 :\u2014\" Communication is possible between mind and mind otherwise than\n\f150 ISupplement.\nReviews.\nthrough the known channels of sense.\" The introductory chapter calls the\nattention of the experimenter to such common sources of error as fraud,\nhyperesthesia, muscle-reading and thought-forms. The four following\nchapters, \" Experimental Transference of Simple Sensations in the Normal\nState,\" \" Experimental Transference of Simple Sensations with Hypnotised\nPercipients,\" \" Experimental Production of Movements and Other Effects,\"\n\" Experimental Production of Telepathic Effects at a Distance,\" give a review\nof the more important part of the experimental evidence. It is not\npossible to give here any adequate idea of the strength of that evidence. It\nappears that tastes, smells, pains, visual images, motor impulses and\ninhibitions have been transferred to normal and hypnotised patients, at\nvarying distances and under conditions which preclude any supposition of\nthe intervention of normal means. It is difficult to understand how any one\ncan follow Mr. Podmore's masterly presentation of these results without\nexperiencing some degree either of conviction or of confusion.\nIn these first five chapters Mr. Podmore consistently aims at his proposed\nend. But with the sixth chapter, which takes up the evidence for thought-\ntransference occurring spontaneously, we enter upon a quite new field.\nChapter VI. itself contains a shrewd estimate of the absolute value of the\nspontaneous evidence, and of its relative value as compared with the\nunpretentious results of the first five chapters. Mr. Podmore unhesitatingly\nrests his case upon the experimental evidence alone. \"If,\" he says on page\n144, \" all the [spontaneous] cases . . . hitherto recorded could be shown\none by one to be explicable by more familiar causes . . . the grounds\nfor the belief in telepathy would not be seriously affected ; we should\nmerely have to modify our conception of its nature, and restrict its\nboundaries.\" While admitting that the spontaneous evidence, far more\nthan the experimental, is exposed to the possibilities of error, he claims that\nthese incidents \"in their aggregate are not such as can be plausibly\nattributed to misrepresentation or coincidence,\" but constitute \"an im\nportant body of evidence. \"\nTo this important body of evidence we are introduced in the nine\nfollowing chapters, the captions of which will sufficiently indicate their\ncontents. Chapter VII., \" Transference of Ideas and Emotions.\" Chapter\nVIII., \"Coincident Dreams.\" Chapter IX., \" On Hallucination in General.\"\nChapter X., \" Induced Telepathic Hallucinations.\" Chapter XI. ,\" Spon\ntaneous Telepathic Hallucinations.\" Chapter XII., \"Collective Hallucina\ntions.\" Chapter XIII., \"Some Less Common Types of Telepathic Hallu\ncination.\" (In this chapter we have reciprocal cases; misinterpreted mes\nsages ; heteroplastic hallucinations ; haunted houses and others mentioned.)\nChapter XIV., \"On Clairvoyance in Trance.\" Chapter XV., \" On Clair\nvoyance in the Normal State.\"\nMr. Podmore admits that the weight of the evidence contained in these\nchapters will be variously estimated by various persons. But he does not, I\nthink, make equally plain the fact that the significance of this evidence is at\npresent far from clear. He has hitherto strictly confined himself to his task.\nHe has given us the evidence.for telepathy. Now, by telepathy Mr. Podmore\nmeans something more definite than the definition above quoted would lead\nus to expect, and the further limitations of his conception speedily come to\n\fSupplement.I 151\nReviews.\nview in the meaning which he ascribes to the perplexing phenomena with\nwhich he is now called upon to deal.\nThis material is interpreted by many in favour of two theories which are\nat present in the deepest disgrace in the scientific world,.the doctrine of a\nlife after death, and its twin, the belief that the intelligence does occasion\nally in some sense leave its body during life, and visit distant scenes. Mr.\nPodmore's object in adducing this evidence is, or seems to be, not merely to\nprove that there is such a thing as a non-sensory communication between\nmind and mind while in the body, but also to show that, admitting such a\nnon-sensory communication as experimentally established, we can explain\nthese spontaneous phenomena without resorting to either of the above\nobnoiious doctrines.\nIn the original definition there is nothingtoexclude either of these theories.\nIt is conceivable that telepathic communication may take place between minds\nin the body and minds out of the body, if the latter exist at all, which we\ndo not as yet know. It is also possible to frame an animistic theory which\nwill fall within the broad domain of that original definition. For it is not\nnominated in the bond that the minds in question must, to affect one another\ntelepathically, remain in the place in which their respective bodies are, and\nthere is nothing inconceivable in the notion that minds may in some sense\nbe capable of translocation while their bodies remain unmoved. It is true\nthat we cannot as yet define in what sense, except negatively. We can be\nquite sure that it is not in any material sense, and that the phantasm does\nindeed belong, as Mr. Podmore shows in the chapter on hallucination in\ngeneral, to the world of dream rather than to that of matter. But until we\nhave fixed more certainly the relations of the dream-world to the\nmaterial, it is as well not to be too dogmatic in our assumptions.\nIt will, of course, not be possible for me to give, within the limits of a\nreview, a complete analysis of the difficulties which confront Mr. Podmore\nin his endeavour to account for these phenomena after the analogy of the\nexperimental evidence. A few must suffice.\nThe experimental evidence suggests what may be called an inductive\nconception of the telepathic process. This conception Mr. Podmore has, I\nthink, in mind throughout, and in the last chapter he has attempted to\nwork it out in detail. We have usually in each case : (1.) A known human\nconsciousness, which we may proleptically style that of the agent ; (2.) A\nmental state, x, consciously existing in it ; (3.) A second known\nhuman consciousness, that of the percipient ; (4.) A second state, x1,\nconsciously existing in it, and resembling or in some way related to state x ;\n(5.) A relation of sequence or coincidence established between states x\nand xl.\nTo this type a large number of the spontaneous cases conform more or\nless exactly, and may be justly regarded as depending upon the same laws.\nIu certain respects we may expect variations. The agent and percipient are\nusually known to one another, and frequently sustain intimate personal\nrelations to one another. Preoccupation on the part of the agent\nwith the thought of the percipient, especially in times of emotional\nexcitement, and a deliberate intention on his part to affect the percipient\nappear to be conditions favourable to the transmission of the telepathic\n\f152 ISupplement.\nReviews.\nimpulse. A passive slate on the part of the percipient seems to favour the\nreception of the impression. The emergence of the induced state in\nconsciousness may follow or even precede the occurrence of the supposed\ninducing state. The induced state x1, may diverge more or less widely from\nthe actual form of the inducing state. If this divergence be very great, the\nmessage may be regarded as misinterpreted. If not very great, the induced\nstate may be termed autoplastic,\u2014that is, constructed by the percipient out\nof material furnished by his own mind upon the lines suggested by the\ntelepathic impulse. When xl is an exact copy of x, the state is said to be\nheteroplastic. Such are the leading features of this type.\nThe difficulties which I shall mention fall under two chief heads.\n1. Those arising from a lack of evidence for the existence of the state x.\n2. Those arising from a multiplicity of simultaneously \"induced \"\nstates.\nWhen there is nothing more than a lack of evidence for the existence of\nx, it is not unreasonable to assume that x exists in some consciousness\nunknown to us. Acquaintance and intimacy seem to be, as I have said,\nconditions favourable to the transmission of the telepathic impulse, but we\nhave reason to think that they are not essential conditions, and, from the\nnature of the case, in most such occurrences the agent's share in the matter\nwould remain unknown,\u2014we should simply have an unrecognised hallucina\ntion, and the evidence for its telepathic origin would be wholly lacking.\nBut frequently the circumstances are such as strongly to suggest an\nextra-human origin for the telepathic impulse. Often the information thus\nconveyed is known to have been in possession of some friend or relative of\nthe percipient who has recently died, and the information is sometimes such\nas we should suppose the dead would wish to convey to the living. When in\nsuch cases we not only know that the information was in the possession of the\ndead, but also have good reason for thinking that it is not in the possession\nof any one living, or not in the possession of any living person known to\nthe percipient, the presumption that the impulse originated with a dead\nperson becomes very strong. Mr. Podmore's unwillingness to resort to this\nhypothesis is, I think, not justifiable. However repugnant such a doctrine\nmay be to our sensibilities as scientists,\u2014especially since it has been con\njoined with the absurdities of \" Modern Spiritualism,\"\u2014it is our duty to\nconsider it fairly as one of the conceivable hypotheses. It certainly is not\nyet proved. But there was a time when telepathy between living minds\nwas also not yet proved, and it is not likely that it would have stood as near\nproof as it does to-day had Professor Sidgwick, Mr. Podmore, Mr. Ourney,\nMr. Myers, Mr. Hodgson and others, at every step refused to consider the\nhypothesis at all. Such evidence, as Mr. Podmore himself shows, should\nbe considered in the aggregate.\nAn analogous difficulty is presented in the phenomena of \"clairvoyance.\"\nIf such phenomena can be established upon human evidence, it would\nappear probable that persons, either in the normal state or entranced, have\ndescribed occurrences remote in space or time or both. The percipient\nseems to become cognisant of these things much as if he had been actually\npresent and had seen them with his eyes. According to the telepathic\ntheory, as formulated by Mr. Podmore, we must suppose that his information\n\fSupplement.I 153\nRevieu.s.\nis drawn from the consciousness of some other person, who did become so\ncognisant of them. But it often seems very improbable that any living\nbeing has at any time had an experience analagous to that which occurs in\nthe percipient's consciousness. Thus when Mr. Cleave in trance sees his\nfriend faint, we certainly cannot suppose that he in any way shared her\nexperience of fainting. He saw it as he would have seen it had he actually\nbeen present In one most interesting series of apparently clairvoyant\nvisions of which I knew, \u2014the patient being an intimate friend of mine,\u2014 the\nvisions shifted between these two types, and in some cases passed through\nboth. In the first stage the patient seemed to be a sticctator of the scene,\nthe supposed agent appearing only as one object among many. In many\nof the visions of this type, the \"agent\" was not in any way thinking of or\ninterested in the patient. In the second stage the patient appeared to\nbecome identified with the visual consciousness and discursive thought of the\nagent, on one occasion heard a remark addressed to him, but never shared\nhis motor sensation or GemeingefiM. It is also noteworthy that the\nvisions of the first type were accompanied by no disagreeable symptoms and\ncould occasionally, though rarely, be produced voluntarily. The visions of\nthe second type were invariably preceded by characteristic and severe pain\nin the head, were followed by great prostration and were never produced\nvoluntarily.\nIt is not improbable that these are distinct but related types, and they\ncertainly do not themselves tend to suggest a thought induction of any\nkind. The first is what is commonly called clairvoyance,\u2014the second seems\nto suggest a partial coalescence of the consciousness of the patient with that\nof the supposed agent. I quote this case, however, as an illustration of\npossible conceptions and not as proof for the existence of the states in\nquestion. The evidence which I have goes to show that the information\napparently derived from these visions was true, but the evidence is not, to\nmy mind, satisfactory.\nIn all cases where the induced state x1 contains non-veridical elements,\nwe may term x1 partially autoplastic. But when the \"induced\" state\ncontains elements which, although veridical, are not apparently drawn from\nthe mind of the agent, but are such as could have been got by some third\nperson, if actually present, much as they were got by the percipient, how are\nwe then to interpret them by the inductive theory ?\nThe second group of difficulties, those attending the explanation of the\ncollectively perceived phantasm, often contains all the above, as well as\nthose peculiar to itself. There is often no known living agent, and the\ncircumstances sometimes suggest a dead agent. Furthermore, the phantasm is\nusually described alike by all the percipients, but I know of little evidence for\nthe imposition of a complete heteroplastic hallucination, under circumstances\nwhere no animistic conceptions are admissible, upon several percipients not\nknown to be especially sensitive to telepathic influences. The single\nunambiguous case which Mr. Podmore quotes (No. 62), is so remote that I\ndo not feel willing to accept it as conclusive. Again, there seems to be no\nknown reason why the phantasm is so commonly that of the human figure.\nThe \"local hallucination \" (haunted houses) presents, in addition to those\nof the above types, certain difficulties of its own. Why, upon the telepathic\n\f154 (Supplement.\nReviews.\ntheory, should hallucinations be attached to certain places ? Mr. Podmore\nmentions (page 314) a curious notion suggested by Mr. Gurney,\u2014that any\nperson, thinking of a given place which is at the time actually experienced\nin sense-perception by some other person, may attain thereby to such a.\ncommunity of consciousness with the other person as to be able, under some\nunknown circumstances, to import into the consciousness of the second\nperson, in the guise of a hallucination, a thought existing in his own.\nThis speculation is certainly fascinating to the idealist, but until some\ndefinite evidence can be adduced in its favour, it is not entitled to rank as\nmore than a speculation.\nIn view of these difficulties, it seems to me that we have no right to say\nthat telepathy is sufficient to account for such phenomena. For my own part,\nI know of no theory that is even approximately satisfactory. It is not, I\nthink, necessary to accept the dilemma which Mr. Podmore offers us in his\nchapter on hallucination between a crude materialistic animism and such\nan inductive conception of telepathy as the experimental evidence and a large\npart of the spontaneous would lead us to form. No one will dispute Mr.\nPodmore's statement (page 272) that the notion of an objective material\nexistence for the phantasm collectively perceived has not been rendered\nmore intelligible \"by the invocation of fixed ether, intercalary vortex\nrings, space of four dimensions,\" etc. ; that the theory \"betrays its own\norigin in a pre-scientific age, and without formal destruction by argument\nhas shared in the euthanasia which has overtaken many other pious opinions\nfound inadequate to the facts.\" But it is also possible to urge similar\nobjections against ascribing \"material\" existence to any phenomena\ncollectively perceived, and many thinkers of repute regard the much lauded\nconceptions of contemporary science as intrinsically little better than the\nbarbarous animism of our forefathers. All alike are the outcome of more\nor less instinctive efforts to formulate the manifold of experience in\nrelatively simple concepts. \"Modern science\" represents a much more\nadvanced stage of this process, and the symbols it has devised represent the\nfacts far mere accurately than the productions of the pre-scientific age\ncould hope to do. Yet not even the most \" scientific \" of these conceptions\ncan withstand a metaphysical,\u2014perhaps better a meta-scientific, analysis. Our\npower of analysis is greater than our power of synthesis ; we can show how\nunsatisfactory these conceptions are, but we cannot frame better to take\ntheir place. It may well be that in these perplexing and unclassifiable\nphenomena we are gaining data whereby future generations will be able to\ncorrect and reconstruct the conceptions which our present day science\nregards as fundamental, and in view of that possibility we should, I think,\nbe cautious in trying to force such facts into any semi-scientific conceptions\nthat we can now frame.\nIn his concluding chapter, after suggesting that telepathy may possibly\nco-operate in normal life with the recognised means of conveying thought,\nand endeavouring to explain by its means the reported action of the metals\nand magnets upon the body and the alleged physical phenomena of\nSpiritualism, Mr. Podmore states the two theories as to the relation of\ntelepathy to our other faculties. He seems inclined to favour the theory\nthat it is a remnant of a lost faculty, but adds that if we admit the existence\n\fSupplement.; 155\nReviews.\nof such supernormal faculties as clairvoyance, retrocognition and prevision,\n\" it would be more reasonable to regard telepathy as a member of the group\nof such supernormal faculties, operating in ways wholly apart from the\nfamiliar sense activities, and not amenable, like these, to terrestrial\nlaws.\"\nWm. RoMaINE NeWBOld,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.A.\nIII.\n(J.) A Modern Priestess of Isis : abridged and translated on behalf of the\nSociety for Psychical Research from the Russian of Vsevolod\nSergyeevich Solovyoff, by Walteh Leaf, Litt.D.\n(2.) Isis very mwh Unveiled: being the story of the great Mahatma Hoax, by\nEdmund Garrett.\nThese two volumes complete the story told in the Report of the\nCommittee on Theosophic Phenomena (Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. 111.).\nIn the pages of the Report we were enabled to examine the finished\nproducts of Madame Blavatsky's genius ; we saw the manufactured\nphenomena, as turned out for the American, Indian, and European markets ;\nwe made the acquaintance of some leading members of the Theosophic\ncult in their final stage, a pleasantly ambiguous blend of charlatanry and\nsimplicity. In Mr. Solovyoff's vivid narrative, as englished by Dr. Leaf,\nwe are privileged to look on at the process of manufacture, to watch the\ngradual evolution of history into myth, of conjuring tricks into occult\nphenomena, of Madame Blavatsky's colleagues into her dupes or her accom\nplices. Mr. Garrett tells us how the business was carried on by less com\npetent hands after the death of the head of the firm, and the disastrous\nconsequence of glutting the market with astral letters.\nMr. Solovyoff is a Russian of good social position, and an author of\nsome repute. At the time when his narrative begins, May, 1884, he was\nstaying in Paris, studying mystic and occult literature, and planning to\nwrite on '' the rare, but in my opinion, real manifestations of the\nimperfectly investigated spiritual powers of man.\" Quite opportunely,\nwhen thus engaged, he came across a recent book of Madame Blavatsky's,\nand a copy of the Matin containing a notice of her arrival in Paris. Having\nobtained an introduction from a friend at St. Petersburg, Mr. Solovyoff\ncalled a few days later. He found Madame Blavatsky lodged in a small,\npoorly furnished apartment, in a long mean street, and was at first\nrepelled by \"the plain, old, earthy-coloured face\" of the Prophetess herself.\nBut they were both Russians, and in a strange land ; Mr. Solovyoff received\ns frank and kindly greeting, and in a few minutes found himself talking\nas to an old friend. The intimacy thus suddenly begun seems to have\ncontinued on much the same footing until the final rupture. Madame\nBlavatsky constantly appealed to Solovyoff's friendship whenever he could\nrender her any service, and he seems never to have disregarded the appeal.\nWhatever he may have thought at different periods of their acquaintance of\n\f156 ISupplement.\nRevinvs.\nMadame Blavatsky's claims to supernormal power, Solovyoff throughout\nseems to have looked upon her as a woman to be loved\u2014or at worst to\nbe pitied.\nTheir first interview, whilst productive of much high spiritual converse,\nwas not wholly barren of \"phenomena.\" Madame Blavatsky left the room\nfor a few minutes\u2014to attend to some domestic duty, as she explained\u2014\nand- shortly after her return the silvery peal of the famous astral bells was\nheard in the air. A few days later, after receiving an assurance that no\nreligious dogma was involved, and that the study of Oriental literature was\nthe chief object aimed at, Mr. Solovyoff was initiated in due form into the\nTheosophical Society, in the presence of Mr. Keightley, and the pure-souled\nchela, Mohini M. Chatterjee. Shortly afterwards he made the acquaintance\nof Colonel Olcott and the celebrated turban given to him in New York\nby an astral visitant from the Himalayas.\nA few days later, Mr. Solovyoff was himself privileged to witness a\nmanifestation of a remarkable kind. He called upon Madame Blavatsky\nby appointment one morning. There were present Madame Blavatsky,\nher sister, Madame Jelihovsky, and others. To them thus assembled there\ncame a ring at the outer door. The door was opened by the serviceable\nBabula, Madame Blavatsky's Hindoo servant, who was seen by Solovyoff to\ntake a letter from the postman's hand, and lay it, securely sealed, on the\ntable. The letter was for Miss X., an elderly lady staying in the house, who\nhad not yet left her room. It occurred to Madame Blavatsky that the\nletter, thus unexpectedly introduced, afforded an excellent opportunity for\na test. She placed the unopened letter against her forehead and slowly\nwrote down the contents of the letter, uttering them aloud at the\nsame time, amidst expressions of scepticism from Madame Jelihovsky.\nIrritated no doubt by this wanton display of domestic unbelief, the\nProphetess vouchsafed further proofs of her power. With a red pencil\nshe drew on the paper a theosophical symbol- of the kind with which readers\nof the Westminster Gazette are familiar through Mr. Garrett's narrative\u2014\nand at the same time underlined \"obviously with a great effort of will\" a\nword in her copy of the letter. The letter was then handed through the\nopen door to Miss X., who came out and read it in their presence. The\ncontents of the letter were identical with the copy made by Madame\nBlavatsky, and the theosophical sign and underlined word occurred in their\nproper place in the original. That this \"phenomenon\" much impressed\nSolovyoff at the time is shown by the fact that he not only signed an account\nof it drawn up on the spot, but that he subsequently sent, in his own name,\na letter detailing the circumstances to the Bebits. The latter fact, indeed, Ls\nnot mentioned in its proper place in the narrative ; but Solovyoff admits, in\nthe description of the incident, that he did not at the time realise all the\npossibilities of fraud in the case.\nA few days later, in obedience to a summons from Madame Blavatsky,\nSolovyoff came away from a theosophical meeting in the middle of a lecture\nby Olcott, and was rewarded for this act of self-denial by witnessing, in the\nsame domestic circle, the birth, under the maieutic hands of Madame, with\nthe still serviceable Babula as assessor, of yet another \" phenomenon.\" The\nmiracle on this occasion, however, was perhaps a trifle crude for European\n\fSupplement.I 157\nReviews.\ntestes ; or the whole performance may have been badly staged. At\nany rate the impression produced upon Solovyoff appears to have been\nunfavourable ; the incident was not recorded over his signature in the\nnewspapers ; and Madame Blavatsky had occasion to lament his hardness\noi heart.\nIn August, 1884, Solovyoff was privileged to have another experience,\nthis time of a less dubious kind. He went to see Madame Blavatsky at\nElberfeld, and on the night of his arrival there, under peculiar circumstances,\nhad a vision of Mahatma M. But lest this dream or hallucination should\nfail of its due effect, the \" Master \" followed it up by inserting the following\nday a confirmatory note in Olcott's coat pocket, \"between a button and a\ntoothpick.\"1 As Olcott was, however, in another room at the time of its\nreceipt, it must be admitted that the Master paid less than his usual deference\nto Western ideas of evidence. At any rate Solovyoff, though obviously\nanxious to believe, remained unconvinced.\nThen came the publication of the Coulomb letters, and the investigation\nby Mr. Hodgson and the S.P.R. Committee ; there were many agitated\nletters and much travelling to and fro on the part of Madame Blavntsky.\nFinally, in August, 1885, apparently\u2014Mr. Solovyoff is vague about times and\nseasons, and extremely chary of dates\u2014he went to Wiirzburg at Madame's\ninvitation. Her only companion at the time was a small Hindoo, one\nBavaji (or Babajee, as he is called in Dr. Hodgson's Report). Madame\nBlavatsky appears to have thought that the time had now come for a final\neffort to overcome the obstinate scepticism of her pupil. He called upon\nher one morning, and found her sitting in a huge arm-chair :\u2014\n\"At the opposite end of the table stood the dwarfish Bavaji with a\nconfused look in his dulled eyes. He was evidently incapable of meeting\nmy gaze, and the fact certainly did not escape me. In front of Bavaji on\nthe table were scattered several sheets of clean paper. Nothing of the sort\nhad occurred before, so my attention was the more aroused. In his hand\nwas a great thick pencil. I began to have ideas.\n'\"Just look at the unfortunate man,' said Helena Petrovna suddenly,\nturning to me, ' he does not look himself at all, he drives me to distraction.\nHe imagines that here, in Europe, he can carry out the same regime as in\nIndia. He never used to eat anything but milk and honey, and here he is\ndoing the same. I tell him that if he goes on like that he will die, but he\nwill not listen. And so he had an attack last night.' \"\nThen came much talk in Russian\u2014a tongue Bavaji did not understand\n\u2014on the S.P.R., and on Solovyoff's want of faith. Then Solovyoff\ncontinues, \"I was walking about the room at the time, and did not take\nmy eyes off Bavaji. I saw that he was keeping his eyes wide open, with\na sort of contortion of his whole body, while his hand, armed with the\ngreat pencil, was carefully tracing some letters on a sheet of paper.\n\" * Look ! What is the matter with him ? ' exclaimed Madame Blavatsky.\n\"'Nothing particular,' I answered, 'he is writing in Russian.' I saw\nher whole face grow purple. She began to stir in her chair, with an obvious\nI An account of theincident, written by Mr. Solovyoff shortly after its occurrence,\n*ill be found in Proceeding! 3.P.R., Vol. III., pp. 393\u20145.\n\f158 ISupplement.\nReviews.\ndesire to get up and take the paper from him. But with her swollen and\nalmost inflexible limbs, she could not do so with any speed. I made haste\nto seize the paper, and saw on it a beautifully drawn Russian phrase.\n\"Bavaji was to have written in the Russian language, with which he\nwas not acquainted : ' Blessed are they that believe, as said the Great\nAdept.' He had learnt his task well, and remembered correctly the form\nof all the letters, but he had omitted two in the word 'believe.' [The\neffect was precisely the same as if in English he had omitted the first two\nand last two letters of the word.]\n\" ' Blessed are they that lie,' I read aloud, unable to control the laughter\nwhich shook me. 'That is the best thing I ever saw. Oh, Bavaji!\nYou should have got your lesson up better for examination.' \"\nThen came more revelations. Madame Blavatsky was alone, except for\npoor Bavaji, and seems to have felt the need of a sympathetic companion.\nAt last an accident precipitated the crisis. Solovyoff went by Madame's\ninstructions to get a photograph from a drawer, and found there a packet of\nthe Chinese envelopes, already familiar to him, in which letters astrally\nconveyed from Thibet were wont to appear. . Then came the dramatic\nmoment. Madame Blavataky unbosomed herself completely. \"What is\none to do,\" she said, \" when in order to rule men it is necessary to deceive\nthem \" ; when they will not accept even the doctrine of Isis Unveiled\nwithout the belief in miracles ; when their very stupidity invites trickery ;\nfor \"almost invariably the more simple, the more silly, and the more gross\nthe phenomenon, the more likely it is to succeed ? \" There is much more\nabout the imbecility of her dupes, and of the world in general, and something\nabout the syndicate of scribes who wrote the celebrated Koot Hoomi letters ;\nof Olcott's blundering but well-intentioned assistance in \" phenomena,\" and\nhis acquittal by the S.P.R. of anything worse than stupidity\u2014a verdict\nwhich Madame seems to have regarded as a personal insult. The strange\ninterview terminated with an exhibition of the \"astral bell,\" and an in\nvitation to co-operate in the manufacture of Koot Hoomi letters.\nOn the same day there followed a second interview, in which Madame\nBlavatsky tried by various means to obliterate the impression which she had\nmade. First, she alleged that it was a black magician, and not she herself,\nwho had spoken through her mouth ; then, that the \" Master \" had designed\nto try the faith of his would-be disciple. Lastly, she used alternately threats\nand promises. After this there followed more interviews with Madame, and\nletters from her : and finally, an extraordinary document, headed \" My\nConfession.\" The receipt of this last appears to have finally decided Mr.\nSolovyoff. On the ICth February, 1886, he despatched to Adyar a letter\nresigning his membership of the Theosophical Society, and shortly after\nwards laid before the Theosophists in Paris the proofs in his possession of\nMadame Blavatsky's fraud.\nAfter that he appears\u2014whether for the sake of a former friendship or\nthrough fear of vengeance\u2014to have kept silent until after the death of Madame\nBlavatsky, and the appearance in a Russian journal of some articles on her\nby Madame .Jelihovsky. It was to correct the false picture drawn in these\narticles that Mr. Solovyoff published in 1892 the account now translated.\nThe book is supplemented by two appendices, containing Madame Jelihov\n\fSupplement.) 159\nReviews.\nsky's comments on Solovyoff's book and Solovyoff's reply. Madame\nJelihovsky quotes many of Solovyoff's letters, written during the period\nof which his book treats, which unquestionably tend to show that he\nwas much more favourably disposed towards a belief in theosophic\n\"phenomena\" than would appear from the narrative written some years\nafter the events. But this, if admitted, does not in any way reflect upon his\n.candour. He must be an exceptional man who can reconstruct with fidelity\nhis earlier mental attitude towards a problem, at a time when after events\nhave placed the solution in his grasp. That Solovyoff was disposed to\nbelieve in Theosophy if he could, appears from his narrative. From his\ncontemporary letters it would further appear that he did actually go some\n.considerable way towards belief. That is all.\nAs regards Mr. Solovyoff's credentials, he tells an interesting story, and\ntells it well. Perhaps for our purposes he tells it sometimes almost too\nwell. He appears not as a rule to have kept a diary or memoranda of the\nevents he relates : on only one occasion does he mention having taken\nwritten notes of an interview, and, as already said, he is vague about\ndates. It is not surprising, therefore, if he had to rely almost exclusively on\nhis memory, or on the letters which he received from Madame Blavatsky,\nthat he should have to some extent misrepresented his own mental attitude\nat the time. Nor are we required to suppose that the conversations reported\nwith Thucydidean aptness have all the authority of historical documents.\nBut such considerations do not seriously affect the value of his testimony.\nThe two most important pieces of evidence\u2014the interview at Wiirzburg,\nand the Confession written some months later\u2014are sufficiently attested, the\none by notes written, as Solovyoff tells us, on the same day, the other by\nthe actual document with a legally certified translation. For the rest Mr.\nSolovyoff tells a straightforward tale, and there can be no reasonable doubt\nthat the incidents of which he treats are in their main outlines accurately\ndescribed.\nScarcely less valuable evidence is afforded by the letters which Mr. Solovyoff\nhas appended to his narrative, written from America by Madame Blavatsky\nto Mr. Aksakoff. We have here the whole early history of the Theosophical\nSociety, told in her own inimitable style by its foundress. The series begin\nin October, 1874, with a letter describing the spirit materialisations at the\nEddy brothers' house, and the writer's meeting there with Colonel Olcott.\nIt goes on to speak of the 11 millions of Spiritualists at the last census\nin the United States, \"which have already grown to 18 millions, almost\n50 per cent.\" (Madame was always a little vague in her arithmetic), and of\nthe writer's own adhesion to the faith\u2014\"I have now been a Spiritualist for\nmore than ten years, and now all my life is devoted to the doctrine.\" Then\ncame, at an inopportune moment, the Katie King exposure, which made\nSpiritualism less popular on the other side of the Atlantic. Madame\nBlavatsky began by denouncing the exposure as \"neither more nor leas\nthan a plot (now almost proved) of the Protestant Jesuitical Society called\nthe Young Men's Christian Association ! \" (Ten years later, the same\nMadame Blavatsky, in a new role, was protesting that another exposure, in\nwhich she was more directly concerned, was due to a conspiracy on the\npart of certain Christian missionaries, who had\u2014as again was \"almost\n\f160 ISupplement.\nReviews.\nproved \"\u2014paid 40,000 rupees to suborn false witnesses). Shortly after we\nread of a secession from the orthodox American Spiritualists, and the\nestablishment of a new organ, the Spiritual Scientist. Then again we hear\nmuch of the Hermetic philosophy and of the Kabbala and of Paracelsus ; of\nthe fruits of Madame's observations in past journeyings in Egypt, Assyria,\nSiam, Cambodia, Mexico. But time would fail to trace the devious paths\nby which Spiritualism grew into Theosophy, ghosts into astral bodies,\nspiritual phenomena into manifestations of the occult power of the human\nmind ; how finally Madame from a medium was metamorphosed into a\nchela, John King with his saucer-shaped cap became the Mahatma Morya\nwith his turban ; and the centre of the spiritual universe shifted from the\ns\u00e9ance room to the Thibetan Himalayas.\nIn these pages we find a partial revelation of the whole life of Madame\nBlavatsky. For the Confession and her earlier letters to Mr. Aksakoff\nindicate pretty clearly what manner of woman she was before she began to\npose as a great Spiritual Teacher. From the same letters we learn by what\nsteps she rose to her position at the head of a movement at one time by no\nmeans inconsiderable. These letters and SolovyofPs narrative help us also\nto a clearer understanding of a personality which she herself might have\ndescribed as a reincarnation of Cagliostro or Alexander of Abonotichos.\nThat she was no vulgar impostor must be admitted. But how much her\nactivities owed to the common greed of bread and butter, and how much to\nsuch subtler instincts as the love of power and the artist's pleasure in the\nwork of his hands it is hard to say. One feature, already patent to all who\nknew her, however slightly, is brought out strongly by Solovyoff's narrative.\nShe had at all times of her life the most singular power of winning the\ninterest, and even the regard, of those who came in contact with her ; even\nof some who mistrusted and half despised her. Her opinion of missionaries\nin general, and especially of missionaries in India, was well known and freely\nexpressed ; yet I have myself seen an Indian missionary sitting bound to\nher side by the mere charm of her conversation, for half a summer afternoon.\nPart of the attraction lay, no doubt, in the fiery energy of her nature,\u2014\nan energy which led her to feel or feign an interest in the most diverse\nsubjects ; which availed to keep her alive when half-a-dozen mortal diseases\nwere warring in her body ; which enabled her to emerge triumphant from\ntwo such cataclysms as the Katie King exposure in 1874 and the publication\nof the Coulomb letters and Mr. Hodgson's report ten years later.\nBut something was due, no doubt, to her simple humanity ; to the large\nness of nature which held men like Solovyoff and women like Mrs. Besant\ncaptive. Certainly she was built on a grand scale. Her very impostures\nwere stupendous in their audacity. What other man or woman could have\nset two continents talking of her by the help of a few torn cigarette papers\nand a buried teacup or so ? And she could inspire fear as well as friendship.\nIt is impossible not to be struck by the very obvious reluctance which Mr.\nSolovyoff showed to offend her\u2014a reluctance which led to his keeping silence\nuntil after her death ; and there is evidence in his narrative that he had.\nreason to fear her vengeance. I am acquainted with another case, in which\nMadame Blavatsky, when as yet she had not reached the zenith of her\npower, half revealed herself to a gentleman in whom she apparently hoped\n\fSupplement.I 161\nReviews.\nto find an accomplice. He, too, drew back from the proffered alliance, but\ndread of her vengeance kept his lips sealed during her lifetime.\nAs regards Dr. Leaf's share in the present book, his name is a guarantee\nfor the accuracy of the translation. Those of us who do not understand\nRussian can see for ourselves that the book is written in clear picturesque\nEnglish. But not the least laborious part of Dr. Leaf's work, it may be\nsupposed, lay in the editing and abridgment of Madame Jelihovsky's\nvoluminous reply, and of Mr. Solovyoffs further comments, for which labour\nall English readers owe him gratitude.\nSpace will not permit us to discuss at length the content* of Mr.\nGarrett's clever and entertaining booklet. But the nature and importance\nof his work can perhaps best be indicated by the following extracts.\nSpeaking in the Hall of Science (writes Mr. Garrett) on August 30th, 1891,\nthree months after Madame Blavatsky's death, Mrs. Besant said :\u2014\n\"You have never known me tell a lie (No, Never ! and loud cheers). I tell\nyou that since Madame Blavatsky left I have had letters in the same hand\nwriting as the letters which she received (sensation). Unless you think\ndead persons can write, surely that is a remarkable fact. You are surprised,\n\u2014I do not ask you to believe me ; but I tell you it is so.

I believe that Mr. Judge wrote\nwith his own hand, consciously or automatically I do not know, in the script\nadopted as that of the Master, messages which he received from the\nMaster or from chelas ; and I know that in my own case I believed that the\nmessages he gave me in the well-known script were messages directly\nprecipitated or directly written by the Master. When I publicly said I had\nreceived, after H. P. Blavatsky's death, letters in the writing that H.

Von Edmund Parish. A. Abel, Leipzig, 1894, pp. 246.\nThis work originated\u2014the author informs us in his Preface\u2014in a study\nof the international statistics of the waking hallucinations of persons in a\nnormal condition, and grew out of a series of lectures given in the Munich\nsection of the Gesellschaft fiir psychologische Forschung. Its aim is to review\nthe whole field of sensory delusions,\u2014one important class of which, viz.,\nthose occurring under normal conditions, has generally been entirely ignored\nin current works on hallucinations,\u2014and to show their relation to \" correct \"\nor \"objective\" perception. The author has made an exhaustive study of the\nGerman, English, French and American literature bearing on the subject,\nas far back as the early part of the century, and the multitude of references\nhe gives form what is probably by far the most complete bibliography of the\nsubject in existence. He also describes a few hypnotic experiments of his\nown, devised to test and illustrate certain points.\nAs his work came out while the last part of the English Report on\nthe Census of Hallucinations was passing through the press, Professor\nSidgwick's Committee did not have the benefit of his criticisms on their\nresults, and his conclusions with regard to the Census are based on the\nprovisional Tables published at the International Congress of Experimental\nPsychology, and on material furnished by the German collection, which only\namounted to 625 answers.\nHis preliminary general account of sensory delusions is excellent,\nembodying the results of all the most important recent discussions, and he\n\fSupplement.I 163\nReviews.\ngives a convenient and well-arranged summary of the kinds of hallucination>*\nthat arise under certain pathological and physiological conditions. The\ndifferences between the pathological hallucinations and.those that occur to\npersons in a normal waking condition appear from the descriptions to\nbe very marked. The former are incidents in a systematic\u2014a more or\nless coherent\u2014course of delusion, with which they tit in, just as our\nordinary percepts of external objects fit in with our ordinary course lf\nthought. They are therefore not often recognised to be delusive. The\nwaking hallucinations of normal persons, on the other hand, are isolated\nexperiences not cohering with the general course of perception, and there\nfore recognised to be hallucinatory.\nThe hallucinations produced by intoxication, various forms of poisoning,\nand acute illness or delirium, are also as a rule very lengthened and\ncomplicated, and are bound up with delusive ideas, involving the whole\nconsciousness of the patient. Different types of hallucinations are often\nreported as the effects of different poisons, but the specific action of the\npoison is only one factor in the determination of the type. The most\nimportant factors are the circumstances and temperament of the patient ;\nsuch drugs as haschish and opium owe their renown as producers of certain\ntypes chiefly to their being the principal narcotics used by Orientals.\nThe hallucinations accompanying certain physiological conditions, i.g.,\nsleep and hypnosis, occur in the state of dream-consciousness. In post\nhypnotic hallucinations, however, the full waking consciousness is\nsometimes\u2014though not always\u2014retained, and in this they resemble the\nnext class considered,\u2014crystal visions. In treating these, free use is\nmade of \"Miss X.'s\" experiences, so familiar to all readers of these\nProceedings, and the analogous phenomenon of \" shell-hearing\" is illustrated\nby an interesting case quoted from Spitta (Iter Schlaf n. die TmumzitxUindt\nii. menschl. Seele, p. 293), who succeeded in inducing auditory hallucinations\nin himself by listening to slight strokes made by a muffled clapper on a bell.\nAfter considering these various types of hallucinations, Herr Parish\nenunciates his main thesis,\u2014that the one element common to all the states\nunder which they arise is a dissociation, of consciousness, more or less\npronounced. He holds that in the pathological state the intellectual\nactivity is obstructed, the higher nerve elements that carry on the work\nof association become exhausted, and hallucinations set in. The process by\nwhich this is supposed to take place is explained more fully as follows :\u2014\nIn abnormal conditions of the brain, for instance in anemia, and also\nduring sleep, some of the higher nerve centres become exhausted, while\nothers are in a state of unusually high tension. There is therefore\nobstruction in the nervous paths leading to the former, and less resistance\nthan usual in those leading to the latter ; hence the nervous impulses that\nwould normally affect the first set, become diverted towards the second,\nand produce there an effect which is a hallucination. During this process,\nsensations which are generally sub-conscious may become conscious, and\nmay thus determine the form of the hallucination ; the influence of sub\nconscious ideas being often seen, for instance, in crystal visions. The\nblocking of paths to the centres which would normally be reached is a\nprocess of \" dissociation,\"\u2014the opening of paths in other directions is what\n\f164 ISupplement\nReviews.\nHerr Parish calls \"enforced association.\" His description of the nervous\naction is, of course, as he says, only to be regarded as a \"diagrammatic\nrepresentation \" of the way it actually takes place.\nHerr Parish maintains that both hallucinations and illusions are\nanomalous reactions of the brain to stimuli in the way just described, but\nthat while illusions arise from dissociation\u2014a dropping out of certain\nprocesses that normally occur, and a consequent failure to correct the\nsensations received ;\u2014hallucinations arise from forced association, the nervous\nimpulses travelling to centres that would not normally be affected by them,\nand producing changes there. He holds that the two processes seldom or\nnever actually take place separately ; but generally one or the other pre\ndominates. The original stimulus may be external or may start in the brain\nitself ; in the latter case, the hallucination is an illusory perception of the\nbrain change. The cases given in illustration of these points are all,\nhowever, what would be generally called illusions, and we fail to see why\nHerr Parish is not satisfied to retain the ordinary usage of the words\n\"hallucination\" and \"illusion.\" There is no doubt that there are two\nquite distinct kinds of phenomena,\u2014illusions, in most cases clearly traceable\nto external perception, which can often be reproduced at will, for their\noriginal percipient, at least, and sometimes for others as well ; and halluci\nnations which, as a rule, cannot be reproduced at all, and can rarely be\nshared, and which, therefore, clearly do not depend on any perception of\nexternal objects. The fact that it is sometimes difficult in practice to draw\nthe line between the two types cannot do away with the distinction between\nthem ; the same difficulty occurs in all attempts at classification, and it is\nnot only more convenient, but also more accurate, to keep the distinctions\nbetween types in view, notwithstanding the existence of intermediate forms.\nThe physiological section of the essay contains also a full summary of the\nlong-standing dispute as to whether hallucinations are originated in the\nsensory or in the ideational nerve centres, and whether the nervous changes\ntravel centripetally or centrifugally. Due weight is given to the many\narguments that have been brought forward on both sides, and the conclusion\nis reached that both views are equally correct (or incorrect), since recent\ninvestigations tend to show that the sensory and ideational centres occupy\nthe same part of the brain.\nLater on, he discusses the evidence for retinal action in hallucinations,\nwhich is drawn from their changes in colour and form according to optical\nlaws, and shows that the effects are probably due to association of ideas ;\nsimilarly, in atropin poisoning and in fever delirium, both real objects\nand hallucinations appear distorted,\u2014the effects observed on real objects\nbeing apparently transferred by association of ideas to the hallucinations.\nIn discussing the theory of points de repere, he thinks that we should\nregard as the starting-point of the hallucination, not a single given sensory\nstimulus, but the sum of all the sensory stimuli acting at the moment. We\ncan then explain the sensory nature of hallucinations by the participation of\nthe sensory nerves, while the particular form they take is determined by the\nbrain changes. There seems to be a certain confusion of ideas in this view.\nThe sensory character of hallucinations can be thus explained only if it can\nbe shown that, in the presence of sensory stimuli, all ideas tend to take\n\fSupplement.I 165\nReviews.\na sensory form, which is obviously not the case. The phenomena of\n\" syntesthesuB \"\u2014when the stimulation of one sense leads to a hallucinatory\nimpression on another sense, for instance, in the case of \"coloured audition,\"\n\u2014lend some slight support to the view ; but, as Herr Parish justly remarks,\nwe know too little of the subject to be able to explain hallucinations as\n\" synesthesias \" ; we have rather to regard syruesthesiie as hallucination*\nwhose regular appearance points to an automatic association, acquired very\nearly in life.\nMany other points of general interest are raised which we have not\nspace here to discuss. One of the most interesting is an elaboration of\nHoppe's theory that many auditory hallucinations originate in the\npercipient's unconscious articulation of his thoughts, in consequence of an\nunusual intensity in the centrifugal motor innervation which is sup*losed\nto accompany all verbal thinking. Without being audible to others,\nthe articulation might reach such a pitch as to give rise to auditory\nhallucinations or illusions. This view, which refers chiefly to morbid cases,\nis supported by some observations on insane patients, and Herr Parish\nadduces one of his hypnotic experiments, in which the suggestion that the\nsubject should articulate all his thoughts did not\u2014as he had expected\u2014\nlead to audible speech, but to an apparent impression on the part of the\nsubject that another person was talking. The same inaudible articulation,\ncarried a step further, produces enforced speaking aloud, and Herr Parish\ncompares the various degrees of the process to analogous stages in automatic\nwriting.\nPassing to the results of the Census of Hallucinations, he gives a\ntabular summary of the English, French, American and Gentian collections,\nwhich contain between them 27,329 answers, of which 3,271, or 11*96 per\ncent., are affirmative, 9*75 per cent. of the men and 14*57 per cent. of the\nwomen answering in the affirmative. The relative frequency of hallucinations\nin the two sexes is thus about the same as in the English collection taken\nalone. It was shown by Professor Sidgwick's Committee, in their Report\non tite Census of Hallucinations, (Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. X., p. 153), that\nthis result may perhaps be accounted for to some extent by women\nremembering their hallucinations\u2014at all events those recently experienced\n\u2014better than men do.\nNext comes the important question of whether the statistical results\nrepresent accurately the frequency of hallucinations. In comparing the\nvarious Ad interim reports published by the English Committee with their\nfinal Tables presented to the Congress, Herr Parish observed that the\npercentage of affirmative answers constantly decreased in each fresh section.\nWhile of the first 2,928 answers collected, 12*4 per cent. were affirmative ;\nof the last 7,724, only 8*1 per cent. were affirmative, or, omitting the\nforeign element. which belongs chiefly to the last section, only 7 0 per cent.1\nOn this ground, he concludes that the total percentage of 9*4 in the English-\nspeaking division is considerably too high, and that it can only be rectified\nby further \" intensive \" enquiry ; a further \" extensive\" enquiry by which,\n1 The percentage given by Herr Parish is somewhat lower, as he calculated it on\nthe assumption that all theforeigners belonged to the last section.\n\f166 ISupplement.\nReviews.\nso to speak, the cream is skimmed off a larger area, will only further\nexaggerate the error. He thinks, in other words, that \" selection \" of\naffirmative answers was consciously or unconsciously exercised to a large\nextent.\nVarious arguments are, however, brought forward in the Report on the\nCensus (pp. 57\u201460) to show that \"selection\" has not had much influence\non the total result, and we may add here that, of the English collectors, 37\ncollected each at least about 100 answers, the total number collected by the\n37 amounting to about 6,500, or considerably over one-third of the answers\nfrom English-speaking persons. It seems likely that these collectors at\nleast must have almost exhausted their circle of acquaintances, and cannot\nhave merely \"skimmed the cream\" from them. Some of the rest of the\ncollection was made by their friends, whose circles of acquaintance would\nhave overlapped theirs, so that certain sets of people must have been pretty\nthoroughly canvassed.\nThen, again, as regards the part of the collection in which the percentage\nis highest, viz., the Brazilian section (23-9 per cent.) its size is evidence\u2014\nconsidering that it was entirely the work of one man\u2014that not much selection\ncan have been exercised, apart from the fact that Professor Alexander was\ncertainly well aware of the proper method of collecting answers. His results,\ntherefore, undoubtedly tend to show that hallucinations are considerably\nmore frequent among the Brazilians than among the English.\nFrom these considerations it appears to us probable that the results of\nthe whole collection are in reality more trustworthy than that of any part of\nit taken alone.\nIt is also noteworthy that in the German collection, although it only\namounts to a total of 625 answers, the proportion of affirmative answers\n(5'95 per cent. from men, 10'72 per cent. from women, 8-16 per cent. from\nboth), is decidedly lower than in any of the other collections, in spite of the\napparent inclusion (see Table II., p. 229) of \"yeses\" relating to hallucina\ntions of non-vocal sounds, which would have been excluded from the\nEnglish Tables.\nAs to the different frequency in different nations, Herr Parish remarks\nthat the existing material is hardly sufficient to form a judgment on, and it\nseems to be partly on the larger proportion of \"yeses\" reported by the\nFrench and Americans, as shown in his Table I. (p. 226), that he founds his\nview that a more \" extensive \" enquiry is misleading.\nBut the numbers, as they stand, cannot be compared with the English\nresults. It is a remarkable fact that the proportion of persons originally\nanswering \"yes\" in the English and in the American collections was almost\nexactly the same ; in the English, 10'5 per cent. of men, 16-1 per cent, of\nwomen, 13-4 per cent, of both ; in the American, 10-97 per cent. of men,\n17'19 per cent. of women, 13-5 per cent. of both. The English \"yeses\"\nwere reduced by counting as \"noes\" those which referred to experiences\nclearly not within the scope of the question asked, and to experiences of a\ndoubtful kind, which the Committee, after careful consideration, excluded\nfrom their Tables. (See Report on the Census, pp. 36-38.)\nThe French collection also contains affirmative answers which in the\nEnglish would have been counted as negative, for instance, some relating to\n\fSupplementI 167\nReviews.\nhallucinations of non-vocal sounds. If we reduce the number of affirmative\nanswers by allowing for these (on the basis of the French Tables in an Ad\nInterim report published in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VTI., pp. 264-7) the\nFrench percentages are brought very near to those of the Russian section of\nthe English collection, and it seems probable that if the same principles of\ncounting had been applied throughout to the French cases as to the English,\nthe number of affirmative answers would have been still further reduced.\nM. Marillier thought the percentage too high, as he found that some persons\nwho collected only \"noes\" did not send in their lists. (See Report of the\nInternational Congress of Experimental Psychology, p. 65.)\nHerr Parish remarks that a comparatively small number of hallucinations\nare reported to occur in bed, but this, he supposes, is because the same\ncondition\u2014a \" dissociation of consciousness \"\u2014that leads to hallucinations,\nalso promotes the forgetting of them. The English Committee pointed out,\nhowever, (Report, p. 171) that the numbers reported as occurring in bed are\nverylarge, considering what a small part of our lives is generally spent awako\nin bed. And if this be so, we cannot draw from them the conclusion that a\nlarge proportion of these hallucinations are forgotten.\nHerr Parish's explanation of hallucinations as due to a \" dissociation of\nconsciousness\" is clearly derived from a study of the pathological cases,\nthough it is possible to apply it also to dreams and hypnotic hallucinations.\nHe says, indeed, that in the different types of hallucinations it exists in\nmany different degrees, and that the profounder the dissociation, the more\n\" massive \" is the character of the hallucination, and the more also is all\nmemory of it prevented. We can find, however, as a rule, no evidence of\nany such \" dissociation \" in waking hallucinations of the kinds included in\nthe Census, with the exception of those that occurred in bed, which were\ntreated separately in the Report, on account of the difficulty of proving that\nthe percipient was awake in all cases. The cases he gives to illustrate the\nsupposed existence of the dream-consciousness occurred after long exposure\nto cold and exhaustion, and are practically dreams, not waking hallucinations\nat all. Mere fixation of the eyes may occasionally tend to bring about a\ndreamy condition, but the English collection contained very few cases that\ncould be thus explained, and it would be a more serious interference with\nintellectual work than experience justifies us in assuming if reading or\nwriting for any length of time were constantly liable to bring on the dream-\nconsciousness, which he suggests was the explanation of the two cases he\ngives on p. 73.\nWhether the state in which hallucinations such as these occur should be\ncalled one of dream-consciousness or not, is, after all, merely a question of\nverbal definition ; but Herr Parish deduces the conclusion that hallucina\ntions, like dreams, are specially liable to be forgotten and therefore that the\nreported numbers no more afford a true measure of the number that actually\noccur than would a reported number of dreams. He admits, however, that\nin sleep there is a much deeper dissociation of consciousness than in waking\nhallucinations, and maintains that forgetfulness depends on this, from which\nit must follow that dreams are forgotten much more than hallucinations.\nAnd since, as a matter of common knowledge, dreams are reported very\nmuch more frequently than hallucinations, it follows A fortiori that halluci\n\f168 ISupplement.\nReviews.\nnations are very much rarer phenomena than dreams. There is really no\nevidence that memory is less reliable about hallucinations than about most\nother things. The Report on the Census shows (see pp. 62\u201469) that the\nmajority of them are forgotten, but an investigation of memory with regard\nto almost any other class of events would probably show similar results.\nThe last chapter of the essay is concerned with the question of telepathy,\nwhich Herr Parish declares cannot at the present day be passed over in any\ngeneral discussion of hallucinations. He approaches the subject evidently\nwith an open mind, but it seems to us that his treatment of it is marked by\na want of discrimination of the different degrees of evidence in different\ncases. There are no doubt a great many apparently veridical phenomena\n\u2014real or alleged\u2014which, by straining a point here and there, can be\nexplained without having recourse to the theory of telepathy, and a study of\nthem is useful in revealing unsuspected sources of error. But the important\nquestion is whether the residuum of well-ovidenced cases can be thus\nexplained away, and with this question Herr Parish does not attempt to\ndeal. The reports of the German collection, which he seems to have chiefly\nstudied, and a number of which are published at the end of his essay,\ncertainly add little or nothing to the evidence, and he did not perhaps\nsufficiently realise the purely provisional nature of the Tables issued by the\nEnglish Committee at the Congress.\nHis criticisms have been in the main forestalled in their Report on the\nCensus, but it may be worth while to recapitulate and discuss them further\nhere. First, he remarks that in testing whether chance will account for the\nnumber of coincidences that occur, we ought to consider only the proportion\nof coincidental to non-coincidental cases recorded during the most recent\nperiod, namely, the five years preceding the enquiry, since veridical or\ncoincidental cases are shown by the Tables to be remembered much better\nthan non-coincidental ones.\nThe calculations of the English Committee, as given in their Report,\nwere made on a much more stringent basis than this, viz , on the numbers\nreported as occurring during the most recent quarter of the year before the\nenquiry. The utmost degree of forgetfulness of non-coincidental cases\nwarranted by the facts (not by mere theoretical considerations) was assumed,\nand it was also assumed that no coincidental cases at all were forgotten.\nThe latter is undoubtedly an extreme assumption. The Committee met\nwith some evidence in the Census itself of such forgetfulness (though not\nindeed of the precise type of case\u2014recognised apparitions seen at the time\nof the death of the person represented\u2014on which their calculations were\nbased) and some evidence also of unwillingness to mention veridical\nexperiences, which, if at all usual, must have unduly reduced the number\nreported.\nIt is also, of course, probable that the disproportionately large number\nof remote coincidental apparitions reported is partly due to some of them\nbeing wrongly remembered as coincidental, rather than to any abnormal\ndifference of memory with regard to the two kinds of cases.\nSecondly, Herr Parish considers that the proportion of coincidental to\nnon-coincidental cases reported during the last five years is much too high,\nbecause it is begging the question\u2014the question whether there are two\n\fSupplement.! 109\nReviews.\ndifferent classes of hallucinations, one subjectively, and the other\ntelepathically caused\u2014to compare the coincidental cases only with the\nclearly objectified apparitions of recognised living persons. He holds that\nwe ought first to prove that the facts cannot be explained by one theory\ncovering all cases. His reasoning then proceeds as follows :\u2014\nSince for the non-telepathic explanation, both the form of the halluci\nnation and the greater or less degree of its externalisation are matters of\nindifference, it is necessary to prove that the veridical cases occur in a larger\nproportion among all hallucinations than can be accounted for by chance.\nNow, of the apparitions of recognised living persons reported to occur\nduring the last five years, as stated in the English Tables presented to the\nCongress, 5 per cent. were coincidental. Assuming the correctness of this\nproportion, then, out of the whole number of such apparitions reported\u2014\n348\u2014there should be 17 coincidental cases. But the whole number of\nhallucinations reported\u2014visual, auditory and tactile, recognised and un\nrecognised,\u2014was 1,871. Therefore the true proportion of veridical cases is\n17 out of 1,871, or only '9 per cent.1 Finally, since he considers it proved\nthat only a very small proportion of the hallucinations that occur are\nremembered, and consequently reported ; since further, there is in his view\nno reason to regard illusions (in the ordinary sense of the word) as\nessentially different from hallucinations, or to separate dreams from waking\nhallucinations, the veridical cases thus dwindle to an infinitely small\nproportion.\nIt is remarkable that Herr Parish can have gone through this carefully\nelaborated piece of reasoning without discovering that the assumption\non which the whole is based is altogether arbitrary and unwarrantable.\nIf we wish to find the true proportion of veridical cases among all kinds of\nhallucinations\u2014including in the term illusions and dreams\u2014it is surely\nobvious that we ought to take all kinds of veridical cases, including veridical\nillusions and dreams, also cases coinciding with other events than death, as\nwell as premonitory cases. It cannot be correct to apply a restriction to\nveridical cases which is not also applied to the whole group of cases with\nwhich they are to be compared.\nNo doubt it would be an instructive\u2014though a somewhat lengthy\u2014\nprocess to discover what proportion veridical experiences of all types bear\nto all experiences of the same type. We should probably find the pro\nportions different in different types, because it is most likely that telepathy\nmanifests itself more easily along some lines than along others. There\nseems reason to think, for instance, that it has a special tendency to produce\nhallucinations. The particular type of case selected in the Census\u2014\napparitions of recognised living persons \u2014was chosen as that in which the\ncalculation of chance coincidence could, for obvious reasons, be estimated\nprobably more accurately than in any other.\nThe whole argument for telepathy, however, of course turns on the\nquestion whether the reports of veridical cases are t trustworthy. Assuming\nthe bona fides of the witnesses, are their recollections to be trusted 1 Herr\n1 Several arithmetical errors were made in this calculation, which we have\ncorrected for the benefit of readers,\nP\n\f170 (Supplement\nReviews.\nParish follows, or rather goes far beyond Professor Royce, in maintaining\nthat a large number of cases can be referred to \"pseudo-memories,\"\u2014an\nirresistible conviction that some event which did not really occur has\nbeen experienced, a hallucination of memory as vivid and convincing and\nof necessity more difficult to correct than a sensory hallucination. The\ntheory was elaborated by Professor Royce in the Proceedings of the American\nSociety for Psychical Research (Vol. I., pp. 366 et seq), but was put forward\nby him as a pure hypothesis, applicable only to a certain number of\ncases, chiefly dreams and mental impressions, not externalised waking\nhallucinations. He himself admitted that there were many apparently\nveridical cases to which it would not apply. The only definite evidence in\nfavour of this hypothesis was drawn from a very small number of morbid\ncases. Illusions of memory, i.e., inaccurate recollections of real events, are,\nof course, common enough, and are one of the errors that have always\nto be guarded against. Herr Parish gives an instance known to himself\nof a lady who dreamt that a certain estate was sold for the price of\n750,000 poodles. Soon after, an offer was made to buy it for 750,000\nmarks, whereupon not only the lady herself, but many of her friends, were\nconvinced that she had dreamt of marks instead of poodles. The story does\nnot appear to rest on the kind of evidence that we should require from\none which was supposed to illustrate telepathy, but assuming that it is\naccurately reported, it is merely an illusion of memory of a familiar kind.\nIf the lady had had no dream at all with regard to selling the estate, a\nhallucination of memory to the effect that she had dreamt of it would\nhave been a much more remarkable error, different in kind rather than\nin degree.\nThe argument against chance coincidence is thus disposed of in a whole\nsale manner by premising (1) that a very large number of non-coincidental\nhallucinations occur, whereas only very few of them are remembered, and\n(2) that the great majority of coincidental hallucinations that are remembered\nnever occurred at all, but are to be put down to hallucinations of memory.\nThe analogy, however, of hypnotic cases, on which Herr Parish in general\nlays so much stress, would lead us to suppose that a revival of apparent\nmemory is more often genuine than hallucinatory. The memory of what\nhas happened during hypnosis may often be revived by a few words bearing\nbut very remotely on the subject. (For examples, see Moll's Hypnotism,\nEnglish Translation, p. 125.) So far as dreams go, we are often reminded of\nthem by some slight incident, and there is no reason to distrust the accuracy\nof such recollections.\nHerr Parish argues further that the method of calculation of chance\ncoincidence is fallacious, because the probability of coincidence is different\nin each case. Supposing that the percipient is nursing her mother who is ill\nwith pneumonia and 75 years old, it is comparatively probable (a) that\n\" among other hallucinations and dreams \" some will relate to the mother,\nand also (6) that the mother may die at the time of one of these \" hallucina\ntions and dreams.\" These are obvious considerations\u2014except the assump\ntion of the frequency of hallucinations under such circumstances. But it\nwas shown in the Report on the Census (see pp. 167-171), that there is little\nevidence for the production of hallucinations by anxiety. Also in most of\n\fSupplementI 171\nReviews.\nthe cases there presented as affording evidence for telepathy, the percipient\nwas in no anxiety at all, and there was therefore no antecedent probability\nthat his \"hallucinations and dreams\" would relate to the dying person.\nWith regard to the age of the dying person, this, of course, affects the\nprobability of death in any individual case, but the method of averages is\nmisleading only if the average of all the individual cases considered differs\nfromthe standard average. Thus, if the coincidental apparitions were only of\npersons dying at advanced ages, it would be incorrect to use as a factor in\nthe calculation the annual death-rate for the whole population. Now, the\nages of the decedents in the coincidental cases included in the English\ncollection were unfortunately not always given, but the circumstances\ngenerally enable us to estimate them roughly. Such an estimate of those 35\ncases which were published in the Report on the Census as supported by\nmore or less good evidence, gives the following results : \u2014\nAge at Death. Number of Cases.\nFrom 6 months to 25 years. 9\nFrom 25 to 55 years. 11\nOver 55 years. 15\nOf the last 15 cases, there are 4 in which the decedent was very likely\nunder 55 years old, while of the middle 11 cases, there are two in which he\nmay have been under 25.\nFrom the Tables of Expectation of Life compiled from the reports of\nthe Registrar General, we find that out of 100 persons (taking men and\nwomen together), 32 die under 25 years of age, 22 between the ages of 25\nand 55, and 46 over 55 years. Out of 35 persons, the corresponding\nnumbers would be 11, 8, and 16 respectively, which are not very different\nfrom the numbers in the Census cases just quoted. It follows that the\naverage probability of death in these cases was about the same as in the\npopulation generally, and therefore that it is legitimate to use the annual\ndeath-rate as a factor in the calculation.\nIf. however, Herr Parish's treatment of the evidence for telepathy will\nhardly seem adequate to those who take a more favourable view of it than\nhe does, it must be remembered that this forms merely a subordinate\npart of his book. To psychologists and to those interested in the\ngeneral study of hallucinations, his wide knowledge, his capacity for\nthe orderly marshalling of facts, and his careful and impartial discussions\nof disputed points, will make his work of great value, if not indispensable,\nand should rank him among recognised authorities on the subject.\nAlice Johkson.\nV.\nBirista di Studi Psichici ; Periodico Mensile. Edited by Dr. G. B.\nErmacora (Padua), and Dr. G. Finzi (Milan).\nIn spite of the prevailingly positive character of scientific thought in\nItaly, psychical studies have in the last few years gained a firm footing\nthere, partly, no doubt, owing to the modified adherence of such eminent\nmen as Lombroso and Schiaparelli, but still more to the active work of the\n\f172 ISupplement\nReviews.\ntwo editors of the new periodical, whose names will be familiar to all\nstudents of the Proceedings. We are heartily glad to see that the subject\nhas now progressed so far as to call for the establishment of a special organ,\nto which we offer a most cordial welcome.\nThe first number, issued last January, opens with a most suggestive and\ninteresting address by the editors, \" Ai nostri lettori.\" It takes as its text\n\" Misoneism,\" the resistance of the human mind to the entrance of new\nideas, as shown, of course, in the attitude of the scientific world towards\npsychical studies. A new idea, the editors say, means a modification of\nbrain-substance ; but all living beings tend to resist anything that causes\nan expenditure of energy, and therefore anything that tends to modify\ntheir organs. This resistance to change, among other effects, produces in\nthe region of thought a secondary form of \" positivism.\" Scientific\npositivism is the progressive adaptation of the intelligence solely and\nentirely to the facts of experience ; this operates to the good of the species.\nBut there is another sort of positivism which may be called that of the\nindividual economy ; this urges the individual to avoid the necessity of new\nand painful adaptations of the intellect involving expenditure of energy,\nand therefore operates hurtfully to progress. A man conscious that he is\na factor in the advance of humanity will always be subject to the opposition\nof these two sorts of positivism, and is tempted to confound with scientific\npositivism that which is only the expression of his own individual desire to\navoid painful effort. The psychical enquirer must endeavour, in the first\nplace, to accept as fact nothing but fact, but at the same time he must not\nshirk the painful effort to adapt his mind, by gradual steps, from ideas\nalready familiar, to those which are new, and that with the least possible\nwaste of intellectual energy.\nAfter this introduction, which is closed by a long letter of good wishes\nfrom Carl du Prel, the number contains one rather curious case of\napparition at the time of death or shortly afterwards\u2014a collective hallucina\ntion of two sisters living near Rovigo, in 1874 ; translations of two other\ncases from the October number of our Journal ; the first part of a popular\nexposition of the present state of our knowledge with respect to telepathy,\nby Dr. Ermacora ; a translation of an extraordinary case published by Dr.\nLi\u00a3beault in the January, 1894, number of the Revue dtVHypnotisme ; notes\non the Census of Hallucinations, on spirit-identity, and on the exposure of\nMrs. Williams ; and finally a long and highly complimentary review of Mr.\nPodmore's Apparitions and Thought-transference, again by Dr. Ermacora.\nHe has some good criticisms to make ; and ends by expressing an earnest\nhope that the work may soon be translated into Italian, \" because the\npopularization of psychic science begins with telepathy, because there is in\nour language no book which adequately treats of the subject, and because\nPodmore's work is the one which most thoroughly attains this end.\"\nWalter Leaf.\n\fGeneral Meetings.\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETINGS.\nThe \"2nd General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, April 5th, at 4 p.m. ; Professor\nSidgwick in the chair.\nMr. F.

Verrall.\nFor the last five years, at irregular intervals and with many\ninterruptions, I have been making experiments in \" guessing \" ordinary\nplaying cards; I have varied the conditions, with a view to testing\nsome of the suggested causes of success \u2014hyperesthesia, telepathy,\nclairvoyance, or telsesthesia\u2014and I will now describe and attempt to\nclassify the results. The number of experiments is in no single series\ngreat enough to justify me in looking upon any suggested explanation\nas proved ; at the same time, the evidence seems to point to certain\nconclusions, and perhaps the publication of my attempts may induce\nothers to carry on similar experiments, which may result in more\nassured conclusions.\nI ought to say that I have recorded carefully at the time each\nexperiment ; occasionally, on beginning a new series, a few preliminary\ntrials were made with a view to ascertaining what would be the most\nconvenient way of carrying out a proposed experiment, but as soon as\nthe method was determined on, every experiment has been recorded.\nWhere another person\u2014my little girl\u2014was concerned, I took the\nprecaution of assigning marks for success to each of us, using the\nmarks as a means of testing the accuracy of the record. Thus I noted\nthe cards drawn and guesses made, she reckoned in her head the marks\nobtained by each of us. When the series for the evening was finished,\nshe would say what marks each had obtained and I would revise my\nnotes. We never found any discrepancy, so I may take it as certain\nthat my records are substantially correct. The rough notes were taken\non loose sheets of paper, copied into a book, and compared the next\nday with the originals. I have no guarantee to offer of the accuracy\nof the notes taken when I was alone beyond that of my desire to avoid\nerror and my knowledge that extreme care is necessary to do so. In\nevery case the guess has been recorded before the actual card was\nlooked at. In cases where it was necessary to cancel a guess\u2014perhaps\nbecause the card fell over on its face or might otherwise have been\nobserved\u2014the fact of the cancelling has been recorded, though the\nguess has, of course, not been reckoned.\nThe experiments have almost all been made after five o'clock in the\nevening, some before dinner, some after\u2014nearly all, therefore, by\n\fSupernormal Acquisition of Knowledge. 175\nartificial light. The series have often been interrupted, sometimes\nunavoidably, sometimes voluntarily. When I have l>een specially\nbusy, or have felt thoroughly disinclined for guessing cards, I have not\ncontinued a series. But if one experiment has been made, I have\nalways continued on that occasion till the regular number has been\ncompleted ; my usual number at a sitting has been 5 or 10.\nThe experiments made fall into five classes, divided according to\nthe supposed cause of success, if success there were. They were\narranged to test the following possible causes of successful guessing of\nunperceived cards :\u2014\nA.\u2014Delicate and cultivated sense of touch\u2014the fingers consciously\nfeeling the face of the card.\nB.\u2014Momentary contact\u2014one finger being placed for an instant on\nthe back of the card.\nC\u2014Telepathy, of various kinds, direct and indirect.\nD.\u2014Hyperesthesia.\nK\u2014Telesthesia.\nI have some difficulty in giving names to the supposed causes in\nthese last two classes, D and E, but as one of the senses (touch or\nsight) has always been employed, though the information has not been\nconsciously obtained through it, I have called the cause provisionally\nhyperesthesia, where the card has been known to no intelligence\nbefore it was guessed, and telesthesia, where the knowledge\nhas been present in one mind and conveyed to the other, not directly\nas a mental image, but indirectly and apparently through the tactile\nsense of the person guessing. I will explain my meaning more fully\nwhen I come to these classes.\nIt will be seen that class A is more nearly akin to class D than to\nany other, and that C and E are possibly closely connected. But as\nthe whole classification is provisional, I have thought it better to deal\nwith the five groups in something like chronological sequence.\nA.\u2014Serine of Touch.\nI was led to try experiments in the direction of ascertaining how\nfar it was possible to know a card by feeling its face, after some other\ntrials had shown me how much easier it was than I had supposed to\nsee the reflection of a card. I had dealt cards out over a polished\nwooden surface, by lamplight, and had seen every card with ease ; I\nfound the same results when I used an ordinary leather-covered writing\ntable, and by a careful arrangement of lights, was able to see enough\nof the cards reflected on a well ironed white linen table-cloth to enable\nme to distinguish with certainty between picture and non-picture cards,\nblack and red, and so on. I could not distinguish 3 of Hearts from\nQ 2\n\f176 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\n3 of Diamonds, but I dare say I should soon have acquired the skill,\nhad I persevered.\nI then went on to see if I could distinguish between a picture and a\nplain card after passing over the surface the sides of my thumbs. I\nfound it quite easy to do so, and in a pack that I had used a few times\nI was able to pick out the picture cards with very few errors. I now\nbegan a regular series with a view to learning to distinguish each card\nby touch. I drew a card, felt it without looking at it, guessed it,\nrecorded the guess, put the card aside, and drew the next. After\nevery 10 or 15 cards, I turned up the cards which had been laid aside\nin a regular sequence, entered the results in the book, shuffled, and\nbegan again. I did not put each card back and then shuffle, as I\nfound it very important to perform the feeling process rapidly, and my\nfingers\u2014or rather thumbs\u2014seemed to lose their sensitiveness if I\nconstantly re-adjusted the cards. As, however, I did not know\nwhether my guesses were correct or not, I do not think the probable\nnumber of successes was materially affected by this method. I made\n50 guesses in an evening, and went on till I had 400 guesses in all.\nFor the results see Table, Series A I. p. 194.\nTaking the separate evenings, the completely correct guesses were\ndistributed as follows : 3, 2, 9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5.\nI found that the art of feeling the number of the pips was one that\ncould be learnt : in that of perceiving the suit I made no conscious\nprogress. The figures on the separate evenings were as follows ;\u2014\nNumber of pips right; 10,8,13,14,8,8,6,16 = 83; most\nprobable total, 31.\nSuit right: 18, 17, 17, 16, 14, 13, 10, 16 = 121; most probable\ntotal, 100.\nBefore leaving this Series I., I may note a curious instance o\u00a3\nan illusory mental impression as to how the guess was made. I\nam a very good visualiser, and as soon as I think of a card, see a mental\npicture of it. On the 3rd night, i.e., after 100 guesses, I found that I\nwas mentally reversing these processes, and had it not been for my\nexperiences of the two preceding evenings should have said, not that I\nfelt, but that I saw the card. From this time to the end of the\nexperiments. T ceased to be conscious of the process by which I learnt\nwhat the cards were.\nThis experience has not been without interest to me in leading me\nto mistrust any personal impression, however distinct, as to how a\nconclusion has been reached. [See Appendix A., p. 190.]\nSince trying these experiments, I have had the sensitiveness of the\nskin of my hands tested, with a view to ascertaining whether there is\nany reason to suppose that I have greater natural facilities than most\n\fSupernormal Acquisition of Knowledge. 177\npeople for recognising cards by feeling theii surfaces. It was found\nthat the sensitiveness of the skin of the hands, as tested by placing\nsmall weights upon it, was not more than normal, and as tested by\nWeber's test, it was not more than nonnal except along the inner edge\nof the left thumb, where the sensitiveness was as high as at the point\nof the index finger, which is unusual.\nB.\u2014Momentary Contact. Pure Guessing.\nSide by side with the series just described I carried on some experi\nments with a view to testing the results of pure guesswork. I took the\ntop card of the pack without looking, put my hands on it and guessed.\nI was careful not to move my lingers over the card nor to look at it. I\nkept my hands on it merely to make some connection ; I waited for no\nimpression, but guessed as quickly as I could get my mind to form a\nchoice. I never seemed to have any reason for guessing one card more\nthan another, and often had great difficulty in making a reasonable\nguess. Such phrases as \" Queen of roses,\" \" 6 of shadows \" came\nconstantly to my lips. For results see Table, B II, p. 194.\nC.\u2014 Telepathy.\nThe experiments in telepathy that I am considering in this paper\nhave all been made with my little girl, now aged 1 1 I have made\nexperiments with her, being myself either agent or percipient, from\nthe time she was four or five years old, using occasionally other objects\nthan cards, and I have once or twice received spontaneous impressions\n.which I am inclined to believe were derived telepathically from her.\nThe record of an earlier series of experiments with cards has been\npublished in the Journal S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 33. The experiments in\ntelepathy now to be mentioned are of two kinds, direct and indirect ;\nin the direct experiments, Series III., she (or I) would draw a card and\nlook at it, and I (or she) would guess. The guess was always recorded\nbefore the actual card was mentioned. In the indirect experiments,\nSeries IV., a card was drawn by one of us from a pack, the back was\nlooked at by both, a guess made by each, recorded, and the card then\nturned over and the face looked at by both. As to our success in\nguessing these cards correctly I shall speak when I come to the next\nclass of experiments, D. I have counted and classified in Series IV.\nthe cases in which our guesses (whether right or wrong) coincided, and\nit is this series which I mean by the experiments in indirect telepathy.\nThe general results of these card experiments in telepathy, direct\nand indirect, is negative\u2014that is, there is no evidence in favour of\ntelepathy. For the actual figures see Tables. There is a slight excess\nover the figures given by probability in the Series IV., but not enough\nto warrant the drawing of any conclusion in favour of telepathy.\n\f178 Mrs. A. W. Yen-all.\nAnother series, III b., in which H. was percipient, should be\nmentioned. To vary the experiments in direct telepathy, which were\nvery dreary work for a child, we started a series in which instead of\nguessing the whole card at once the percipient guessed in three stages,\nreceiving the answer \"Yes,\" or \"No,\" before the next guess. Thus,\n\" Picture Card\".\u2014\" No.\" \" Diamonds.\"\u2014\"Yes.\" \" Eight.\"\u2014\"No.\"\nThe success was somewhat greater in this series (which is included\nin C Ilia in the Table), but the experiments soon proved as dull as the\nothers, and we abandoned them.\nThe extreme difficulty in keeping up any interest in this \"very dull\ngame\" may account for the failure of the experiments. In the original\nseries, some years ago, the child was quite unfamiliar with cards, and\nmuch interested in them. On the occasions I am now discussing, the\ncards themselves were no longer interesting to her, and she was keenly\nanxious to be successful and correspondingly depressed at failure.\nIn the course of the experiments in direct telepathy, we had some\ninteresting experiences, which are perhaps worth noting for the benefit\nof future investigators. On one occasion, when I had drawn a card\nand was holding it as usual, with the light of the lamp on it, H. said\n\" 3 of clubs ; I saw that through the back, against the light.\" We\nproceeded to investigate and found that in some circumstances it was\npossible to see the pips through, although it was not easy to do so\nunless we put the card actually against the globe. On another occasion\nI was looking at 8 of hearts, and H. guessed 7 of hearts, adding ;\n\" That must not count, for I heard you say hearts.\" On further\ninquiry, she said that she heard \u2014t, \u2014 t, \u2014t, \u2014t, and then 'art, 'art\n'art. My attention had, as I knew, wandered on this occasion, and it\nis possible that I did say the word unconsciously. I had a cold, and\nmy breathing was more difficult and louder than usual. We never\nhad another similar experience. These guesses just mentioned do not\nappear in the tables. I mention them here because they suggest a\npossible explanation where the number of successes in thought-transfer\nence is slightly higher than probability would lead us to expect\u2014viz.,\nthe including of a few cases where the information was conveyed by\nthe ordinary channels, neither agent nor percipient observing that such\nwas the case.\nAs bearing on the question of telepathy between H. and myself, I\nadd two notes, one on a case of apparent spontaneous telepathy, the\nother on experimental telepathy where the interest of both agent and\npercipient was greater than in the case of the experiments with cards.\nApparent Spontaneous Telepathy, between H. and myself.\nOn January 22nd, 1891, I was sitting alone in a perfectly dark\nroom, with my two hands on a small wooden table. At this time I\n\fSupemoimal Acquisition of Knowledge. 179\nwas in the habit of sitting in this way every day for a quarter of an\nhour, but nothing had so far occurred of any kind. On January 22nd\nI went into the drawing-room at 5.45, and left when the clock struck\nsix. When I had sat for about 10 minutes I saw a bright spot of\nlight, which, however, disappeared when I looked fixedly at it ; a\nmoment after, I had a very clear vision in another part of the room of\na golden key, very large and bright. I shut my eyes, and on opening\nthem again saw the key. This persistence of a vision is quite unlike\nmy experience in crystal-gazing. The handle was towards my right,\nthe wards to my left ; the key was nearly horizontal, the handle\nslightly higher, as it would be if the key were lying on the ground\nwith the wards nearer to me than the handle. But in the absence of\nany object to compare with the key, I could not say whether it was\nrepresented as lying on the ground.\nThe phenomena I was looking out for were not of this nature, and\nas I happened to be interrupted just as I left the room, I unfortunately\nmade no note at the time. About 7 o'clock H., aged 7J years, came\nback from a small children's party in a great state of excitement about\na magic lantern, which she much regretted that I had not seen. The\nstory represented was that of Bluebeard and the \" golden key.\" This\nkey, she said, appeared in several of the pictures, one, \" a dreadful one,\nwith the key lying in the blood.\"\nOn hearing this, I noted my own vision and the time, 5.55 p.m.,\nwith a sketch of the key\u2014and H.'s account, as above given. Two\ndays later I was able to see the slides, and fix the hour of the perform\nance. The show began, the hostess told me, at 20 minutes or a quarter\nto 6, and lasted about a quarter of an hour. The more sensational\nslides had been omitted, and there was no picture with the key lying\nin the blood. The key appeared 3 times, once held by Bluebeard, once\nby Fatima, and once lying on the ground, in the same position as I had\nseen it, but reversed ; i.e., with the handle to the left. In no picture\nwas the key golden.\nIt was clear then that my vision did not reproduce anything that\nhad been actually seen by the child, although it seemed to have\noccurred at the time when she was seeing the pictures and wishing that\nI could do so also. It should also be noted that the child's own\naccount to me did not reproduce exactly what she had seen. It was\nnot till some years later that I discovered by accident that in the first\nversion she had ever read of Bluebeard, a French one, the key was\ngolden. The staining of the key with the blood is, of course, an\nessential element in the story, and H.'s account of the show suggests\nthat the central incident to her mind was the golden key lying in the\nblood. If then, my vision were due to something more than chance,\nH. seems to have conveyed to me a symbolic representation of the\n\f180 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\nstory as conceived by her rather than a reproduction of the actual\npicture at which she was looking.\nApparent Thought-transference of Clearly Visualised Scenes, I being\npercipient.\nIn the autumn of 1893 we tried to transfer visualised scenes ; in\nthis I believe myself to have had some slight success as percipient with\nother people. H. and I sat in the same room, at some distance, back\nto back ; she thought of a scene or picture, I looked at the ceiling,\ndescribed what I saw, and drew it. There was not complete silence,\nbut no leading questions were asked, and very few remarks made. I\ntook down at the time, on one occasion, every word that was said, and\nam sure that no sort of hint is given by H., other than the\ninevitable one of satisfaction or disappointment, of which I am\nconscious, though it is not expressed. After my description and\ndrawing were complete, H. made rough outlines in some cases where\nher description was not definite enough to please her. She did this\nbefore seeing my drawings. We have made in all 7 attempts, besides\n2 where I had no impression of any kind. Out of these 7, in 2 cases\nH.'s visualisation was not clear enough to enable her to draw anything,\nand in these two cases I failed completely. In one case, there may\nhave been a connection between my impression and H.'s mental\npicture ; the four remaining cases I will describe in detail.\n(a). My description was as follows :\u2014\nDarkish centre, perhaps brown ; light or white side pieces, like an\nodd-shaped chandelier or a gigantic white butterfly. Most conspicuous\nvivid blue background, as if the object were seen against a bl ight blue\nsky. My drawing is reproduced on the Plate, marked P.l.\nH.'s picture, in her own words :\u2014\nShip leaving Port Uarin, very tall, brown, central mast, white\nsails\u2014the whole showing against a brilliant blue sea, with dark brown\nrocks on one side. For H.'s drawing, see Plate, fig. A. 1.\nShe had seen this on the Cornish coast, when on a visit without\nme, and had been struck with the beauty of colouring. She was\ndisappointed at my not seeing the rocks.\n(4.) My description; \u2014\nFat insect\u2014no, child\u2014child with its back to me, and arms and legs\nstretched out ; colour reddish brown in the centre ; shiny bright head,\nvery solid body. (See Plate, fig. P. 2.)\nH.'s picture :\u2014\nBaby , in a passion, standing in the corner with his face to\nthe wall.\nThe child in question had very shining, bright hair, much brighter,\n\f\f\fSupernormal Acquisition of Knoidedge. 181\nas H. said, than his frock, which was white (not brown). He stood\nwith legs and arms outstretched,\n(c.) My description :\u2014\nLarge globe on the top of a pillar \u2014 base indistinct\u2014cannot\n?ee colour of globe ; it is light, has reflections, is dazzling and bright\u2014\nperhaps an electric light on the top of a pillar. (See Plate, fig. P.3.)\nH.'s picture :\u2014\nSun setting behind point of hill, so that a little notch is taken out\nof the disc of the sun by the point of the hill. The whole scene is\ndistant, lower ranges of hills leading up to the highest, behind this is\nthe setting sun. Mist over the lower part. (Sff Plate, tig. A.3.)\n(i\u00a3) My description, verbatim. H.'s comments in italics.\n\"Scene, outdoors\u2014colour, green. Yes.\n\" Right hand definite, left hand undefined, e.g., on right hand,\nmountain or hill, line of trees, house. Which f\n\" Right hand, hill\u2014green hill, clear outline. Something at bottom\nof hill, behind it sea\u2014or before it. Purplish flat surface fills middle\nof picture. Object [at foot of hill] not natural\u2014geometrical in out\nline. Hmv large 1\n\"Can't see size ; colour, white and red. No horizontal lines ; [lines]\nvertical and aslant.\"\nH.'s picture :\u2014\nDieppe as seen from the steamer (6 months before ; H.'s first\nimpression of a French town). Cliff sharply defined on right ; on left,\nview cut off by the steamer. Red and white houses below the white\ncliff in the green hill, all seen across a dull bluish sea.\nI have given the account of this impression in detail because it\nillustrates the difficulties which I experience in what I may call inter\npretation. The objects present themselves to my mind as groups of\nlines, accompanied by an impression of colour, but there are no external\nobjects for comparison, so that it is difficult to get any notion of their\nsize\u2014and sometimes, as in this last case, they appear in succession, so\nthat even their relative proportions are not easy to determine. The\n\"object at the foot of the hill\" seemed to be equally likely to be a house\nwith a red roof and white front, a red waggon with a white load, or a\nchild's white pinafore against a red dress. The only certainties were\nthat the main colours were red and white, and the general trend of the\nlines vertical and aslant. The description is, I think, not inaccurate\nwhen referred to the view of Dieppe at the foot of the cliffs. Again\nin the 3rd case, it will be seen that in general outlines the two drawings\nare similar, but I interpreted my impression on too small a scale when\nI suggested a globe of electric light carried on a pillar for what was\nthe sun momentarily resting upon the hill top.\n\f182 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\nD.\u2014Hyperesthesia.\nThe card experiments under this head fall into two main divisions\n\u2014viz. : (1) Those already spoken of, where two persons guess; (2)\nOther experiments in which I alone looked at or touched the pack\nof cards.\nI will begin with the first division, Series V. and Va.1 I have\nalready partly described the method, and will only add that I shuffled\nand H. drew the card, that on forming a guess each person said\n\" Now,\" that when both \" Now's \" had been said, H. spoke her guess, I\nmine. I recorded both, and then the card was turned up. I shuffled\nafter each guess, and we guessed 10 at a sitting. The reason that H.\nmentioned her guess before I did was that I thought that, as she was.\nquite a child at the time, she might be influenced to change her card\nif she heard mine before recording her impression. I may have been\ninfluenced in the same way, but at least I was aware of the danger.\nThe first series was in February, 1890; the next in October, 1890, with\na fresh pack ; the two short series were in January, 1891, and May,.\n1892. Some preliminary experiments with an old and defective pack\nwere successful, and we then began the regular series. For results see\nTable, p. 195.\nIt will be seen that, taking the totals, the success is marked, and\nso it is in each of the long series. The cards were different in each of\nthe four series. In the first series we used a pack which had been\noccasionally used for piquet, and there was a slight difference in the\nappearance of the cards that had been more often used. The difference,\nhowever, was so slight that H. did not notice it when I drew her\nattention to it, and I was myself unable, at the end of the experiments,\nto sort the piquet cards from the others. Still it is possible that the\ndifference, slight as it was, may have helped me to guess the cards\nrightly. There was a perceptible progress in my guessing of the\nnumbers of cards : 6, 5, 7, 13, 10 (total 41), being the totals correct\nin each 50, while the total of suits correctly guessed by me was\nprecisely in accordance with probability\u2014viz., 62.\nFor the second series, in October, 1890, we used a fresh pack, with\nbacks dark in general colouring and well covered. They were not\nunused, but were entirely unfamiliar to me and quite new to H. I\nwas not so successful in guessing numbers (22 instead of 41), while I\nwas nearly as good in guessing cards (9 for 10). The results with\nH. were not quite so good as those in the first series (number right,\n22 ; card right, 9 ; instead of 26 and 14 respectively). The third\nseries was unavoidably interrupted ; the only interesting point about\nit was the striking example it offered of what I have observed on other\n1 The guesses are identical with those in Series IV., described above.\n\fSupernormal Acquisition of Knowledge. 183\noccasions, namely, the tendency to be distinctly good or bad, rather\nthan indifferent, in this special form of guessing. On one evening, out\nof 10 guesses, I was right 6 times as to suit and 3 times as to number,\nthus scoring half my total, both of \"number right \" and \"suit right,\"\non one of the four nights. The 4th series promised well, but was also\nunfortunately interrupted. The cards in this series were pale in\ncolouring and had not been used by either of us before.\nI made a careful examination of the cards correctly guessed in the\nfirst and last sets of this series (V.) with a view to determining the\nquestion whether the large number of successes\u2014obviously beyond\nwhat chance would produce\u2014was due to recognition, conscious or\nunconscious, of cards previously drawn. Such an explanation will not\naccount for everything ; in the first 10 attempts in the 4th series,\nfor instance, I guessed 2 cards correctly, 2 of diamonds and 6 of\ndiamonds. Of these, 2 of diamonds was drawn again nearly a month\nlater and rightly guessed by H., while 6 of diamonds was drawn\nagain on the same night and incorrectly guessed by us both. In the\nfirst set of 250, my 10 completely correct guesses represented 8 cards,\nand H.'s 14 completely correct guesses represented 5 cards, but in all\ncases the cards correctly guessed were turned up on other occasions\nand not rightly guessed.\nI now come to the second division of this Class D\u2014viz. : solitary\nexperiments in guessing cards without excluding the senses of sight or\ntouch, but without applying them to the faces of the cards. The\nwhole series where I used my eyes I will call VI., but I will treat\nseparately of the five sets of experiments. The series in which I used\nonly the sense of touch I call VII. In July, 1892, after the conclusion\nof the double series just described, I began a set of experiments alone.\nI shuffled the cards, picked up the top one, being careful not to touch\nthe face, looked at the back and made a guess. I used a pack of cards\nthat had been used, I think, for some of our telepathic experiments,\nbut the backs of which I had not examined. With these I made 100\ntrials (see VI. 1, Table, p. 195).\nI then bought a new pack, thick, well glazed, with dark well\ncovered backs, with gilding on them. I chose them with a view to\ntrying success under what I believed to be the worst possible\nconditions, as I have a fancy that it is easier to guess when the backs\nare pale in colour and not highly glazed. The results are shown in\nVI. 2; see Table, p. 195.\nThe next series (VI. 3) was a very short one ; the pack was\nanother perfectly new one, with pale but well covered backs.\nThe next 30 (VI. 4), some months later, were tried with a new\nand unused pack, and the last 20 (VI. 5) with a pack specially opaque.\nThe most marked results were with the familiar pack, but I ought\n\f184 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\nto say that in the 2nd set with the new pack, out of the four cards\ncorrectly guessed, 3 were guessed at their first appearance, the 4th at\nits second ; but this one, as well as two of the others, was drawn again\nand incorrectly guessed. Comparing these results with those obtained\nin the double experiments of the same kind, I am convinced that the\nwhole explanation is not to be found, as I once thought, in the identifi\ncation of certain cards by marks on their backs, though this may occur\nand help to produce the success.\nThe last series I tried (No. VII) was one where I used touch only ;\nthis ran concurrently with set 2 of series VI. I shut my eyes, during\nshuffling and drawing, and placed one finger of the left hand on the\nback of the selected card. I had some difficulty in obtaining impres\nsions at all, even after waiting some time. The results were not more\nthan what chance might give, 2 complete successes in 100 guesses.\nBefore going on to record our most recent experiences, I may\nperhaps here mention some of my own impressions as to the way in\nwhich my knowledge was obtained in the more successful series, though\nI place very little confidence in the trustworthiness of such impressions.\nI will also here mention some delusions which I had, and some cases\nwhere I seem to have misinterpreted my impressions.\nGenerally, when looking at the back of a card, I see a sort of ridge\nor ridges along it which represent the face to me. For instance, a 4 or\n6 will have a longitudinal ridge at each side, a 2 or 3 one central ridge,\na 5 and an ace run down to a hollow, but the 5 is more distinctly\nraised at the edges than the ace ; 7 and 8 seem to be closely alike, all\nover little ups and downs, and so, again, are 9 and 10, while the\npicture cards present a curious uniformity of surface, with no ridges\nat all. At one time I thought certain cards were more inclined than\nothers to spin on the surface on which I placed them, but on making\nexperiments I could not find that this was the case. On several\noccasions I convinced myself that impressions as to marks on the\nback were complete delusions ;\u2014e.g., in the last of the 2nd set of 250\n(Series IV. and V.) a card was drawn which I thought looked like king\nof diamonds ; we had drawn king of diamonds earlier in the evening\nand on its back I had noticed five little marks close together. I saw-\nfive nearly similar marks on the card in question, and (note the dream\nlike- quasi reasoning !) guessed queen of diamonds. The card was king\nof diamonds. Of course I at once said that it was marked, but H.\ndeclared she could see nothing. I undertook to pick it out of the\npack. I went through the whole pack, and laid aside two cards as\nhaving little marks, like in kind, but not identical with those on the\nking. These two cards proved to be the knave and the 2 of diamonds,\nbut I had failed to find the king, and on close examination could see no\ntrace of any kind of mark on it. Again, when alone, I was sure that\n\fSupernornud Acquisition of Knoivledge. 185\na card was \" very like \" the last one\u2014king of clubs (correctly guessed)\n\u2014and therefore decided to guess queen of clubs. But immediately\nafter I felt sure that it was a spade. So I guessed queen of spadi's.\nThe card was a king of spades-\u2014obviously more like king of clubs than\nany other. Had I reasoned correctly from my impression, I should\nhave guessed correctly. As it was I failed.\nOn another occasion, after some successful guesses alone, I showed\nthe cards to my husband to see if he could see any marks or ridges on the\nbacks. I gave him ace of diamonds which I had just guessed correctly,\nbut he could see nothing. I drew another, and handed it to him : he\ngave it back (on a book) saying it was possible that there was\nsomething down the middle. I looked and said, \" No ; now the 10 is\nan odd card ; I have never guessed a 10 right. This may In; a 10\u2014yes,\nit is a 10, I should think hearts.\" It was 10 of spades. This guess is,\nof course, not counted in the series.\nOnce again, alone, I drew a card, and thought it was an ace ;\u2014then\nmy attention having been called to the backs by a small tear in the\nfirst card drawn that evening, I noticed equal signs of use at the top\nand bottom of this card, and concluded that it was a reversible card.\nI therefore (notice the absuid inference) decided that it was not an ace.\nI made no guess, and cancelled the trial, as it was obviously not\nspontaneous guessing. The card was ace of diamonds, the one\nreversible ace.\nThese cases seem to tell against the theory that success is due to\nthe perception of actual marks on the bucks of the cards, too slight to\nbe easily seen ; for the signs which seemed to guide me had probably\nno actual existence. On the other hand, the appearance of something\non the back\u2014ridges, hollows, ifec.\u2014more or less corresponding with the\nface of the card, taken together with the fact that I had no success in\nguessing when my eyes were shut, suggests to me that the stamping of\nthe pictures and pips on the cards may possibly produce indications on\nthe backs, which are visible under some conditions and to some persons.\nAs illustrating the possibility of hyperesthesia, see in Appendix B,\nthe account of some experiments with diagrams in contact with the\npercipient, but not consciously felt ; but as they were known to the\nagent, telepathy may have been the cause.\nE.\u2014Telctsthesia.\nThe last series of which I have to speak were undertaken after I\nhad read an account of experiments by M. Roux in the Annales dn$\n'Science* Psychiqtues, July, 1893. We selected the 13 cards of one\nsuit out of two packs, and the agent took those of one pack, the per\ncipient those of the other. The agent drew a card from her pack and\nlooked at it. The percipient with eyes shut sat at some distance with\n\f186 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\nher back to the agent, holding her own pack, with the backs of the\npards towards her, in her left hand. The percipient transferred her 13\ncards from left to right hand slowly until she had a wish to stop at any\nparticular card. This card was reckoned as her \"guess.\" In the first\nseries, in which H. acted as agent, I had no success. I seldom felt any\nimpulse, and often went through the whole 13 cards and began again,\nchoosing at random (I always kept my eyes shut) but very soon I\nrecognised the cards by touch, and this naturally spoilt the experi\nment. I had probably unconsciously recognised the cards by touch\nbefore my conscious attention was drawn to the fact. On looking\nback at the record I find that I \" guessed \"\u2014that is, stopped at\u2014\nthe same card twice in one evening (5 trials ) and on six out of\nthe first twelve evenings, namely, on the 1st, 4th, 6th, 10th, 11th, 12th.\nOn the 13th evening I stopped at the 10 for my second guess, again\nfor my third, and again for my fourth. I was conscious on this\noccasion of recognising it, that is, I was conscious of a certain\nfamiliarity in the card which made me wish to select it. On the next\nnight, I stopped at the 7 for my first guess, and could not get rid of\nit, selecting it four times out of five. After we had finished I tried\nto select the 7 by deliberately feeling the cards, but failed. I mention\nthese facts because they seem to me to confirm the earlier experiments\nas to the facility of learning to recognise a card by touch. At the\nsame time they seem to show that the amount of skill which can be\nattained in such matters is far beyond what the experimenter is able\nconsciously to exert.\nFor the purpose of the particular experiment I was anxious to try,\nthis delicacy of touch was most inconvenient. We went on, however,\nwith the experiments with a new suit, and later on tried 26 cards\n(two suits) at a time instead of one. For results see Series VIII. and\nVilla, Table, p. 196. The packs were altered between the two sets of\neach series.\nTaking these two sets, where 13 cards were used, it will be seen\nthat H.'s success is almost double the most probable number\u201421\ninstead of 11'5. From the beginning she, unlike me, was aware of a\ndefinite impulse to stop ; her difficulty in deciding which card to select\ncame from an occasional uncertainty as to which of two cards was the\nf card intended.\"\nSome incidental observations may be interesting. On the 5th\nevening of the second pack (diamonds), H. had stopped three times at\nthe 10, and I thought that she might be beginning to recognise the\ncards by touch. She knew nothing of my experiments in that\ndirection. On the next evening, at the 2nd trial, she said : \" I have\nguessed what this is,\" meaning that she had a mental impression, and\npn stopping at a card, she added, before seeing it, \" here it is, it is\n\fSupernoTTTial Acquisition of Knowledge. 1*7\nthe 6,\" which was the right card. I note this as possibly explaining\nthe process that results in success, namely, telepathy, more readily\nfelt subconsciously than by the conscious mind, but on this occasion\nreaching the consciousness as well as apparently enabling the percipient\nto stop at the right card. I do not know, and H. was not able to\nsay, whether, when she said \" I have guessed,\" she had already\ntouched the right card. Her impression was that she \" saw \"\u2014she\nis also a good visualiser\u2014the card before she felt it, but in the\nlight of my own experiences in feeling cards, (see above, p. 176) I\nAttach little value to this impression.\nHowever, on this evening, when our sets were finished, we tried\nsome experiments to see whether H. could select a given card,\nconsciously or unconsciously. I shuffled the cards, and she tried to\n\u00a3nd the required cards under the same conditions as above. The two\nsets of trials were as follows :\u2014\nA.\u2014I named a card and asked her to find it ; the cards named\nwere, 6, 7, 6 : the cards drawn were, respectively, 7, 6, 8.\nB.\u2014She thought of a card (unknown to me) and tried to find it.\nThe cards thought of were king, 2, queen ; the cards drawn were 6, 6,\nking.\nIt will be seen that on no occasion did she succeed, when\ndeliberately trying to produce the required card ; the choice of one\ncard (the 6), three out of the six times, suggests that her fingers were\nsensitive enough to find again a card once drawn.\nBut I have still to mention the most interesting of all the\nobservations that I have been able to record. On the 1st night of the\n2nd set (diamonds), when H. was percipient, I was aware of an\nimpression beforehand that H. was going to guess correctly on the two\noccasions when she did so. I therefore decided to record beforehand\nany such impression that I might have. As soon as H. had drawn her\ncard, I was in the habit of recording my card, before she looked at\nhers, and I now arranged to put a mark whenever I had the impression\nthat she was right. The result was as follows :\u2014\nNumber of cards guessed correctly by EL, 9 ; of these all were\nmarked by me.\nNumber of guesses marked by me, 11. Of these 9, as above, were\nright ; one was wrong (queen for king), the 11th was half right\u2014i.e., I\nfelt sure that H. had guessed, made my mark, felt her stop at what I\nwas sure was the right card, and wondered why she did not speak.\nThen she said : \" Well, this one,\" and produced the 4. (My card was\nthe 3.) On my saying \" No,\" she said : \" Oh, then, it is the other, I\nwas not sure,\" and produced the preceding 3.\nIt is difficult for me to describe what is the nature of the impression\nI receive, which leads me to believe that the percipient has been\n\f188 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\nsuccessful. All who have tried to convey an idea by thought-\ntransference must be familiar with the sensation that after a special\neffort the thought has been actually projected into space, leaving one\nfatigued and conscious of a loss. But in this case that I am trying\nto describe, the effort made seems to meet with a response, the force\nexerted, instead of departing, returns, and the momentary fatigue is\nfollowed by so vivid an impression of recovery of power that it\namounts to a pleasurable physical sensation. Difficult as it is to\ndescribe, the sensation is unmistakable, and\u2014what is more important\n\u2014seems rarely to be misleading.\nSince writing the above, I have received a report of the results of\nsome 200 guesses of cards done under somewhat similar circumstances\nto those described under the head of D. The conditions were better,\ninasmuch as the card was drawn by one person, who did not look at it,\nand guessed by another. Not only is there, under these circumstances,\nthe guarantee against self-deception afforded by the presence of\nanother person, but the tendency to recognise a card by touch in\nshuffling is overcome.\nI quote from the account I have received :\u2014\n\" Mrs. Y. sat at one end of an ordinary table, and Mr. Y. on the\nopposite side. A screen was formed by a piece of newspaper fixed up\nagainst a stand. Behind this Mrs. Y. drew a card from a pack and,\nwithout looking at it, placed it face downwards on a book and passed\nthe card and book to Mr. Y. whose fingers never touched anything\nbut the back of the card sometimes. A shuffle of the pack followed\neach guess. On two occasions third persons were present.1 Mr. Y.\nsees or does not see an image on the back of the card. This is\nsometimes so faint that nothing can be made of it ; sometimes it is\nshifting and variable ; sometimes clear, with colour. Sometimes no\nimage is seen at all.\"\nIn all cases, even where no image was seen, a guess was made ; it\nis probable that had all cases where no image appeared been rejected,\nthe number of successful guesses would have borne a higher ratio to\nthe most probable number than they do in the record as it stands.\nBut that the success is very striking, the figures (given at the end of\nthe Table, see p. 196) show.\nTwo guesses are excluded from the calculation because they were\nalternative ; they were (a) 4 or 5 of hearts, the actual card being 5 of\nhearts, (b) 2 or 3 of diamonds, the actual card being 2 of diamonds.\nThe following is a complete record of three more recent series of\nexperiments\u2014carried out in the presence of other witnesses\u2014 in\n1 The corroboration of these persons has been obtained.\n\fSupernormal Acquisition of Knowledge. 189\nwhich Mr. Y. only made a guess in the cases where he saw a distinct\nimage.

I have witnessed\nother phenomena of interest in Mr. Y.'s presence, besides the card-experi\nments here cited. In the series signed by me, I gave Mr. Y. the cards\nmyself, shuffling the full pack between each experiment, and sliding off the\ntop card under my hand, face downwards, on to a piece of cardboard, in\nsuch a manner that neither he, nor I, nor Mrs. Y., could obtain the slightest\nglimpse of its face. The cards were thick, with a pattern on the back, and\nwere guessed as they lay face downward on the cardboard, upon a small\ntable between Mr. Y. and myself, being in my sight all the time. The\nperception seemed to come gradually, the suit being generally guessed in a\nfew seconds, if at all, and the number of pips in a few seconds to half a\nminute longer.\"\nI should be very glad to receive accounts of similar experiments\nfrom any other informants who may be inclined to try them. Reports\nto be addressed to me at 5, Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge.\nAPPENDIX A.\nIllustrating Misinterpretation of Means by which Information\nis Conveyed to the Mind.\nThe observations now to be mentioned seem to me in some -ways\nanalogous to the imaginary transference of the source of information\nfrom one sense to another, mentioned on p. 176, inasmuch as in each\ncase there is a sensation erroneously interpreted. But instead of a\n\fSupernormal Acquisition of Knowledge. 191\nperception actually derived from one sense appearing to be derived\nfrom another, as with the cards, in these cases a piece of information\nnot consciously possessed at the moment is conveyed to the conscious\nintelligence by means of an apparent mechanical difficulty, which on\nexamination turns out not to exist. The information thus obtained is\nusually negative ; that is, this apparent mechanical difficulty prevents\nmy doing something unnecessary or undesirable^which I should know to\nbe such if I thought about it, but which from thoughtlessness I am on\nthe point of domg. An illustration will make my meaning clearer.\nConstantly, when using my typewriter, it has happened to me to\nfind a difficulty in pressing a key, so great a difficulty as to oblige me\nto look to see what is wrong. I then see that what is wrong is that\nmy finger was on the wrong key, but there is, in fact, no difficulty\nwhatever in depressing the key if I determine to do so. The effect of\nthis apparent mechanical difficulty is to draw my attention in time to\nthe mistake I am on the point of making.\nI have notes of two similar occurrences, both extremely trivial, but\nillustrating the above point. One day last September I was putting\non my bonnet, and had taken the pin, which goes through the back, to\nsecure it. The pin entirely refused to pass through my hair, and after\nsome inefficient thrusts, I took it out to look at the point to see what\nwas wrong. I then saw that I had not taken the usual pin ; with\nthis particular bonnet I had been in the habit of wearing a large-\nheaded ornamental pin, whereas the pin I now held had a small glass\nhead, and was one I usually wore with a hat. Tliere was nothing\nwrong with the point, and now that I knew what I was doing I had no\nsort of difficulty in pushing it through my liair. The two pins are\nquite unlike in shape and weight ; what probably happened was that\nmy hand felt something unusual in the head of the pin, but instead of\ntoy becoming conscious of the difference in sensation of the head, my\nattention was attracted by the apparent bluntness at the point.\nThe second experience occurred a few days later. I wrote, in the\nafternoon, five letters, and then stretched out my left hand to the\nstationery case to take the necessary envelopes. I wanted five, and as\nI can usually take a small number without error expected to take five.\nBut I did not get enough ; I found that I only had three, and tried to\ntake a couple more. But one of these two slipped through my fingers\nand I only held one. I was quite vexed at my maladroitness, gave up\na further attempt for the present and proceeded to fold my letters,\nput them into envelopes, and address them. When I came to the 5th\nletter, I remembered that I had an envelope ready addressed for this\nletter, as I had written the night before, but torn up the letter after\nreceiving a letter by the late post, which decided me to wait for fuller\ninformation. I had kept the envelope, and it was actually lying on my\nr 2\n\f192 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\ntable while I was trying to take the five envelopes. I may have seen it,\nbut if I did, it was unconsciously ; it was only when I found that I\ncould not get five envelopes that I discovered that I did not require\nmore than four.\n. APPENDIX B.\nRecognition of Objects by Telepathy ok Hyperesthesia.\nPercipient, Aged 7\u00a3 Years.\nH.\nIn November, 1890, I tried the following experiment with H. I\ndrew a diagram, which I placed on H.'s forehead, while her eyes were\nshut, and asked her to describe it. To make the performance more\nlike a game, I went on to ask what colour it was, and what she could\nsee through it. We tried four experiments, three on the afternoon\nof November 16th, and one at 6.15 on November 30th, with the\nfollowing results :\u2014\nObject drawn.\nH. drew a triangle with her finger in the\nair. Bight.\n-A\nH. described and drew an irregular figure,\nwhich did not seem to satisfy her, then said it\nA triangle with apex was like an oval dish <*\"\"*> . Wrong.\nc.\ncut off.\nSquare.\nJT\nH. said : \" It's like a window with no\ncross bars,\" and drew a four-sided rectangular\nfigure in the air. Bight.\nH. said : \" It's a diamond.\" \"What else 1 \"\nsaid I, meaning what colour, &c. \" It's got a\nline across it, and another across that. The\ncolour is pale blue.\" Bight.\nSquare divided into 4\nsquares by a vertical\nand a horizontal line.\nWhen I gave her the diagram, she turned it anglewise and said,\n\" Oh yes, that's right, and the colour was not far wrong.\" As the\ndiagram was drawn in ink on white paper, I did not understand, and\nasked what she meant. She said, \" Why it's all blue, bluish white\ninside, and even the ink is blue.\" The diagram had been dried with\nblotting paper and was not a very deep black, but I could see nothing\nblue. Ten minutes afterwards she picked up the paper again and\n\fAnalysis of Mrs. Verrall's Card Experiments. 193\ncommented on the fact that it was blue, the lines dark bright blue,\nand the inside pale blue. I burnt the diagram and discontinued the\ngame after observing this persistence of a self-suggested hallucination.\nWe had previously tried experiments which seemed to show that\nthe child could feel the diagram. She could almost always tell whether\nthe right or wrong side of a playing card were placed on her fore\nhead. I was quite unable to distinguish the two sides. I am more\ninclined to attribute her successes (3 out of 4) to hyperesthesia than\nto telepathy.\nANALYSIS OF MRS. VERRALL'S CARD EXPERIMENTS.\nBy C. P. Sanger, F.S.S.\nIf we make m guesses, and the probability 1 of each individual guess\nbeing right is p, it is clear that the most probable number of successes\nis mp ; but the probability of being successful exactly mp times is less\nthan J. Suppose that pr is the probability2 that the number of\nsuccessful guesses lies between mp-r and mp + r, then the \"probable\nerror\" may be defined as that value of l' which makes pr = \\. This\nvalue of r is approximately I ,J2irmp (1- p) when m is large. In the\nTables given below, I have calculated the \" probable error \" from this\nformula. It is also found that pT will differ from 1 by a very small\nquantity if we take r to equal 3 >J2(1 - p)mp, so that any number of\nsuccesses greater than tnp+3^\/2 (X \u2014 p)mp would indicate that the\nsuccesses had not all been obtained by mere chance. In the Tables\nbelow I have calculated the \" number of successes required to prove\nskill \" from this formula.\nAs these formule are obtained by assuming that m is large and that\nmp and m (1 - p) are not small, it is probable that they would not give\ntrustworthy results if applied to the case of \" whole cards.\" I have\ntherefore omitted to give any calculations or inferences based on them.\nThe figures given for \"number of pips\" are probably not very\ntrustworthy when the number of trials is less than 200. The number\nof trials is certainly insufficient to base any very definite conclusions\n1 For a complete discussion of the problem involved, see Professor Edgeworth's\npapers on \"The Calculus of Probabilities applied to Psychical Research\" in the\nProeadings S.P.R., VoL III., p. 190, and Vol. IV., p. 189.\n1 The general value of pr is given by\nPr = 7=1 P dx + . p \u2122\nV ttJ o V27rp(l-p)m\nwhere \u2014- - 2p(l\u2014p)m.\n\f194 G.

The remarks of Mr. Myers, in his essay on\n\" The Demon of Socrates\" (Proceedings, Vol. V., Part XIV., pp. 522\u2014\n549) contain almost all which I have met with on this curious topic,\nfrom the pen of the modern psychologist. Perhaps one may be per\nmitted a few comments on these notes of Mr. Myers. He would not\nlay stress on his obiter dictum that the Venerable Jeanne had \" no con\nspicuous strength of intellect.\" Simplicity, as all witnesses declared\u2014\nwith \" feminine subtlety,\" according to Beaupere, one of her judges\u2014\nwas the mark of the Maid. She was uninstructed. She could not\nread. But her native intellectual strength is attested by the lucidity\nof her political ideas. She went straight to the point : the necessity\nof recovering France, of expelling the English, of securing French\nloyalty by crowning the Dauphin. Like Bedford, she saw that, after\nthe Coronation at Rheims, Paris must \" fall at one stroke,\" (I quote\nBedford) if the stroke were swiftly dealt. Paris did not fall, because\nJeanne's counsel was neglected, and during the derisory negotiations\nwith Burgundy, which she denounced, Paris was garrisoned by fresh\nEnglish troops.\nIn the same way, Jeanne's replies to the most subtle and en\nsnaring theological questions (replies recorded by her hostile judges),\nare worthy of her Master, our Lord, and are irrefutable proof of\n\" conspicuous strength of intellect.\" Her improvised skill, not only\nin tactics and strategics, but in the practical art of the artillerist, is\nattested by d'Alencpn, and is apparent to any intelligent reader of\nthe story of her campaigns.1 She not only struck sudden and\nsevere blows, not only organised surprises, but (as Captain Marin\nproves at length) understood the game of war on the great scale.\nMeanwhile, the manners of this peasant girl were the manners of a\ngrande dame. In brief, she had this quality of genius, that no situa\ntion, however novel and strange, found her unready or incompetent.\n1 Captain Marin's Jeanne d'Arc, Stratigitte et Tacticienne, may be consulted.\n\fThe Voices of Jeanne d'Arc. 199\nTo me it seems that Shakspeare himself gives less extraordinary\nproof of \" conspicuous strength of intellect,\" for we never see Shaks\npeare put to trial in great practical affairs. On the bodily vigour of\nthe Maid, it is needless to dilate. Severe wounds did not incapacitate\nher from instant action ; she wore arms for six days without intermis\nsion1 ; all her comrades testified to her extraordinary endurance, and\nwithout such endurance, her week of victory, crowned by the battle of\nPatay, would have been impossible.\nOne point may be left to physiologists and physicians.\nTwenty-five years after her death, her Maitre d' Hotel, d'Aulon,\ndeclared that women who knew her well had averred that she was\nfree from the infirmities of her sex. Nothing to this effect was stated\nby ladies in whose houses she had lodged, who had the most intimate\nacquaintance with her, who had bathed with her, and shared her\ncoach. Her unusual, if not unprecedented, personal modesty is described\nby her comrades in arms, and may explain the origin of the rumour.\nIntellectually and physically, then, the Maid, like Socrates, was un\ndeniably robust and vigorous. Except under stress of fasting, chains,\nand the torture of a prolonged trial, or after her leap from the top of\nthe donjon of Beaurevoir, we never hear of ill-health in Jeanne d'Arc.\nAll this differentiates her from the neuralgic, neurotic, or epileptic\npatients of the Salpetriere, and from mystics like the contemporary\nSt. Colette. The vague and question-begging term \" hysterical \" can\nonly be applied to Jeanne if we argue, \" All visionaries are hysterical.\nJeanne was a visionary. Therefore, Jeanne was hysterical.\"\nIn her private character, we learn from every side that she was\nnaturally gay and humorous. Some of her answers to her judges show\nthis : the most touching proof of all is that when one of the notaries\nat her trial made a mistake in a date, she corrected him, laughed when\nher accuracy was demonstrated, and playfully threatened \" to pull his\nears if he made another blunder.\" Such were the natural gaiety and\nhigh spirits of a captive who, in chains and fasting, was being tried\nfor her life. On the other hand, the Maid, while the best and most\nindustrious girl of her village, had early attracted the ridicule of other\nchildren by her extreme devotion. She kept fast-days strictly, she\nwas much in prayer, from her infancy upwards. To prove that such\npractices may beget hallucinations, we have (among many other cases)\nthe example of the American Puritan scholar, Cotton Mather. Having\nnoticed that, after prayer and fasting, Cotton Mather saw an angel,\nwho entertained him with literary conversation, I called to this fact\nthe attention of Pere Ayroles, S.J., an historian of the Maid. The\nlearned father asked me if Mather's prophecies were fulfilled, as a rule.\n1 Contemporary Letter of Boulainvilliers.\n\f200 Andrew I.ang.\nI had to answer \" No,\" whereon Pere Ayroles drew a not unnatural\ndistinction, unfavourable to the New England mystic.\nThe period when Jeanne supposed herself to see her first visions\nwas physiologically critical. She was either between thirteen and\nfourteen, or between twelve and thirteen. M. Sim\u00e9on Luce, in his\nJeanne D'Arc a Domremy, held that she was of the more advanced\nage, and his date (1425) fitted in with some public events, which,\nin his opinion, were probably the occasions of the experiences.\nPere Ayroles prefers the earlier period (1424) when the aforesaid\npublic events had not yet occurred. After examining the evidence on\nboth sides, I am disposed to think, or rather I am certain, that Pere\nAyroles is in the right. In either case Jeanne was at a critical age,\nwhen, as I understand, female children are occasionally subject to\nillusions. Speaking then as a non-scientific student, a mere literary\nman, I submit that on the side of ordinary causes for the visions and\nvoices, we have :\u2014\n1. The period in Jeanne's life when they began.\n2. Her habits of fasting and prayer.\n3. A rumour of her abnormal physiological condition.\n4. Her intense patriotic enthusiasm, which may, for all that we\nknow, have been her mood before St. Michael announced to her the\nmission.\nOn the other side, as facts more or less inconsistent with hysteria\nand hysterical illusions, we must reckon her unprecedented vigour of\nmind and body, her humour, her lack of the customary superstitions\n(such as belief in fairies), her unswerving belief in the objectivity of\nwhat she saw and heard and the contents of the messages which she\nbelieved herself to have received. The point which I have italicised\nhas been a subject of dispute. It is enough to say that Jeanne's\nrecantation, made in sight of the stake, is notoriously a very dubious\ndocument, and that she most undeniably withdrew it, preferring death\nand obedience to her voices to such a life as the English were leading\nher. There is another informal document (written a week after her\ndeath) concerning an examination held on the day of her martyrdom, a\ndocument which the greffiers refused to sign and which is unsigned\n(Proces I. p. 477). The testimony of this paper, such as it is, assures\nus that Jeanne ceased to believe that her voices came from saints and\nangels. They had promised \"release with great victory;\" she was being\nled to the stake, therefore she had been deceived. But even now she\nmaintained that the voices and visions, whencesoever they came, were\nobjective. \" Realiter habuit revelationes et apparitiones spirituum.\" In\nthe letter of Henry VI. to the nobles, prelates, and towns of France,\nhe (or rather Bedford) adopts this dubious confession. \" Seeing her end\napproach, she plainly knew and confessed that the spirits which often\n\fThe Voices of Jeanne d'Arc. 201\nappeared to her were evil and lying spirits, that their promise to\ndeliver her was false, and so she bore witness that by these spirits she\nhad been mocked and deceived.\" (Proces I., 493. Rouen, June 28th.)\nOn the scaffold, at last, she understood the nature of her victory and\ncalled upon her familiar saints. Thus Jeanne, on the most dubious\nand most unfriendly evidence, never conceived that her \" voices \" were\nmerely subjective and hallucinatory. Bad spirits or good, they were\nspirits ! Taking it for what it is worth (and, though it is informal,\nM. Quicherat does not think that it is forged), this posthumous\ntestimony adds another important fact to our knowledge.\nOnly when within an hour of the inevitable fire, did Jeanne\ndream that her voices had deceived her. Therefore, previously, they\nhad not deceived her, or not essentially. The intimations thus\nobtained had been correct. If any external evidence for this can be\nadduced, the visions of Jeanne will certainly be differentiated from\nthose of Cotton Mather, for example.\nI.et us then, examine the evidence as to the origin and nature of\nthe alleged phenomena. Mr. Myers regards Jeanne's replies to her\naccusers, in 1431, as \" the only trustworthy source.\" Certainly, if\nthe Proces has been garbled, (as is probably the case, for in a brief\nofficial recapitulation facts are stated which are not in the full\nReport), it was not garbled in a sense favourable to the accused. But\nI conceive that letters and other evidence, written in 1429, are not to\nbe neglected, while criticism may discern much valuable or significant\nmatter even in the Procss of 1452-56.\nI shall begin with the letter of the S\u00e9nechal de Berry, Perceval\nde Boulainvilliers, to the Duke of Milan, (Proces V., p. 115.) The\ndate is June 21st, 1429, six weeks after the relief of Orleans. After\na few such tales as that the cocks crowed when Jeanne was born, and\nthat her flock was lucky, he dates her first vision peractis aetatis suae\nduodecim annis, \" after she was twelve.\" Briefly, the tale is that, in\na rustic race for flowers, one of the other children cried, \"Joanna,\nvideo te volantem juxta terram,\" \"Joan, I see you flying near the\nground.\" This is the one solitary hint of \" levitation \" (so common in\nhagiology and witchcraft) which occurs in the career of the Maid.\nThis kind of story is so persistent that I knew it must have been\ntold in connection with the Irvingite movement in Scotland. And it\nwas ' There is, perhaps, just one trace that flying was believed to be an\naccomplishment of Jeanne's. When Frere Richard came to her at\nTroyes, he made, she says, the sign of the Cross.l She answered,\n\" Approchez hardiment, je ne m'envouleray pas.\" Now the con\ntemporary St. Colette was not infrequently \" levitated ! \"\n1 Procit I., 100.\n\f202 Andrew I.ang.\nTo return to the voices. After her race, Jeanne was quasi rapla\net a serisibus alienala, then juxla earn affuit juvenis quidam, who bade\nher \" go home, for her mother needed her.\"\n\"Thinking that it was her brother or a neighbour \" (apparently she\nonly heard the voice, and did not see the speaker), she hurried home,\nand found that she had not been sent for. Next, as she was on the\npoint of returning to her friends, \" a very bright cloud appeared to her,\nand out of the cloud came a voice,\" bidding her take up her mission.\nShe was merely puzzled, but the experiences were often renewed. This\nletter, being contemporary, represents current belief, based either on\nJeanne's own statements before the clergy at Poictiers (April, 1429),\nor on the gossip of Domremy. It should be observed that till Jeanne\ntold her own tale at Rouen (1431) we have not one word about Saints\nor Angels. She merely spoke of \"my voices,\" \" my counsel,\" \"my\nMaster.\" If she was more explicit at Poictiers, her confessions did\nnot find their way into surviving letters and journals, not even into\nthe journal of the hostile Bourgeois de Paris. We may glance at\nexamples.\nThe Journal du Siege dOrleans is in parts a late document, in\nparts \"evidently copied from a journal kept in presence of the actual\nevents.\" (Quicherat. In Procis IV., 95.) The Journal, in February,\n1429, vaguely says that \" about this time \" our Lord used to appear to\na maid, as she was guarding her flock, or \"cousant et filant.\" A St.\nVictor M.S. has couranl et saillant, which curiously agrees with Bou-\nlainvilliers. The Journal, after telling of the Battle of the Herrings\n(February 12th, 1429), declares that Jeanne \" knew of it by Grace\nDivine,\" and that her vue a distance induced Baudricourt to send her\nto the Dauphin. (Proees IV., 125.) This was attested by Baudricourt's\nletters (IV., 125). All this may have been written as late as 1468,\nbut a vague reference to an apparition of our Lord rather suggests\ncontemporary hearsay, before Jeanne came to Orleans. Jeanne never\nclaimed any such visions of our Lord. The story of the clairvoyance as\nto the Battle of the Herrings is also given in the Chronique de la Pucelle.\n(Proces IV., 206.) M. Quicherat thinks that the passage is amplified\nfrom the Journal du Siege. On the other hand, M. Vallet de Viriville\nattributes with assurance the Chronique de la Pucelle to Cousinot de\nMontreuil, who was the Dauphin's secretary at Poictiers, when the Maid\nwas examined there in April, 1429.1 If Cousinot was the author, he\ncertainly did not write his chronicle till long after date. However, he\navers that the story of clairvoyance was current in the spring of 1429.\nThe dates exactly harmonise; that is to say, between the day of the battle,\nFebruary 12th, and the setting forth of the Maid from Vaucouleurs,\n1 HUtoire de Charltt VII., II., 62.\n\fThe Voices of Jeanne (CArc. 203\nthere is just time for the bad news from Rouvray to arrive, confirming\nher statement, and for a day or two of preparation.\nThese and other documents, whether contemporary or written\nlater by contemporaries, contain none of the references to visions\nof St. Margaret, St. Catherine, and St. Michael, which we find\nin Jeanne's own replies at Rouen. For this omission it is not\neasy to account, even if we suppose that, except when giving evidence\non oath, the Maid was extremely reticent. That she was reticent, we\nshall prove from evidence of d'Aulon and Dunois. Turning to\nthe Maid's own evidence in court, we must remember that she was most\naverse to speaking at all, that she often asked leave to wait for advice\nand permission from her voices before replying, that on one point she\nconstantly declared that, if compelled to speak, she would not speak\nthe truth. This point was the King's secret. There is absolutely con\ntemporary evidence, from Alain Chartier, that, before she was accepted,\nshe told Charles something which filled him with surprise, joy, and\nbelief. (Proces V., 131. Letter of July, 1429.) The secret was con\nnected with Charles's doubts of his own legitimacy, and Jeanne at her\ntrial was driven to obscure the truth in a mist of allegory, as, indeed, she\nconfessed. Mr. Myers does not seem to have understood this point.\nAll that tale of an angel and a crown was mere allegory. Jeanne's\nextreme reluctance to adopt even this loyal and laudable evasion is the\nmeasure of her truthfulness in general. Still, she did say some words\nwhich, as they stand, it is difficult to believe, to explain, or to account for.\nFrom any other prisoner, so unjustly menaced with a doom so dreadful,\nfrom Mary Stuart, for example, at Fotheringay, we do not expect the\nwhole truth and nothing but the truth. The Maid is a witness of\nanother kind, and where we cannot understand her, we must say, like\nherself, passez outre I\nWhen she was \" about thirteen,\" she had a voice from God, to aid\nher in governing herself. \" And the first time she was in great fear.\nAnd it came, that voice, about noon-day, in summer, in her father's\ngarden \" (where other girls df old France hear the birds sing, \" Marry,\nmaidens, marry ! \") \"and Jeanne had not fasted on the day before.1\nShe heard the voice from the right side, towards the church, and\nseldom heard it without seeing a bright light. The light was not\nin front, but at the side whence the voice came. If she were\nin a wood \" (as distinguished from the noise of the crowded and\ntumultuous court) \"she could well hear the voices coming to her.\"\nAsked what sign for her soul's health the voice gave, she said it bade\nher behave well, and go to church, and used to tell her to go into\nFrance on her mission. (I do not know why the advice about going to\n1 The reading is nec not et, as in Quicherai Prodi I. 52, compare. L 216.\n\f204 Andrew I.ang.\nchurch is generally said to have been givenfirst.) Jeanne kept object\ning that she was a poor girl who could not ride, or lead in war.\nShe resisted the voice with all her energy. As to her male dress,\nshe \" varied.\" Obviously she was anxious not to involve her first\nwarrior friend, Jean de Nouvellompont, as having made the suggestion\nthat she should dress as a man. Her loyalty to all of her party perhaps\nmade her hint that her voices were her advisers ; this is obscure. She\nasserted that she knew the Dauphin, on their first meeting, by aid of\nher voices. (I. 56.) She declared that the Dauphin himself \" multas\nhabuit revelationes et apparitiones pulchras.\" In its literal sense,\nthere is no evidence for this, but rather the reverse. She may mean,\n\" revelations \" through herself, or may refer to some circumstance\nunknown. \" Those of my party saw and knew that voice,\" she said,\nbut later would only accept them as witnesses if they were allowed\nto come and see her. (I. 57.)\nThis is the most puzzling point in Jeanne's confession. She had\nno motive for telling an untruth, unless she hoped that these remarks\nwould establish the objectivity of her visions. Of course, one of her\nstrange experiences may have occurred in the presence of Charles and\nhis court, and she may have believed that they shared in it. The\npoint is one which French writers appear to avoid, as a rule.\nShe said that she heard the voice daily in prison, \" and stood in sore\nneed of it.\" The voice bade her remain at St. Denis (after the repulse\nfrom Paris, in September, 1429), but she was not allowed to remain'.\nOn the next day (the third of the trial) she told Beaupere that she\nwas fasting since yesterday afternoon. Beaupere conceived that her\nexperiences were mere subjective hallucinations, caused by fasting, by\nthe sound of church-bells, and so on. As to the noise of bells,\nColeridge writes that their music fell on his ears, \"Most like articulate\nsounds of things to come.\" Beaupere's sober common sense did not\navail to help the Maid, but at the Rehabilitation (1456) he still main\ntained his old opinion. \" Yesterday she had heard the voices in the\nmorning, at vespers, and at the late ringing for Ave Maria, and she\nheard them much more frequently than she mentioned.\" \" Yesterday\nshe had been asleep when the voice aroused her. She sat up and clasped\nher hands, and the voice bade her answer boldly. Other words she half\nheard before she was quite awake, but failed to understand.\" (I. 62.)\nMr. Myers says that this rousing from sleep by such a voice is \"\u00bb\nphenomenon often observed in our cases of veridical hallucination.\"\nBut, in the spirit of Beaupere, I may ask if the phenomenon is\nunfamiliar to the insane, who are often haunted by airy voices 1\nShe denied that the voices ever contradicted themselves. On this\noccasion, as not having received leave from her voices, she refused to\nsay anything as to her visions.\n\fThe Voices of Jeanne d'Arc.\nAt the next meeting she admitted having heard the voices in court,\nbat in court she could not distinguish the words, owing to the\ntumult She had now, however, leave to speak more fully. The voices\nwere those of St. Catherine and St. Margaret. Later she was\nasked if St. Margaret \" spoke English.\" Apparently the querist\nthought that the English Margaret, wife of Malcolm of Scotland, was\nintended. They were crowned with fair crowns, as she had said at\nPoictiers two years before. She now appealed to the record of her\nexamination there, but it was not in court, nor was it used in the trial\nof Rehabilitation. It has never been recovered. A witness who had\nexamined her at Poictiers threw no light (twenty years later) on the\nsaints and voices. Seven years ago (that is, when she was twelve) she\nfirst saw the saints. On the attire of the saints she had not leave\nto speak. They were preceded by St. Michael \" with the angels of\nHeaven.\" \" I saw them as clearly as I see you, and I used to weep when\nthey departed, and would fain that they should have taken me with\nthem.\" *\nAs to the famous sword at Fierbois, she averred that she had been\nin the church there, on her way to Chinon, that the voices later bade\nher use a sword which was hidden under earth,\u2014she thinks behind, but\npossibly in front of the altar,\u2014at Fierbois. A man unknown to her\nwas sent from Tours to fetch the sword, which after search was found,\nand she wore it.\nAsked whether she had prophesied her wound by an arrow at\nOrleans, and her recovery, she said \" yes.\"\nThis prediction, omitted, as to its exact details, by Mr. Myers, is\nsingular in that it was recorded before the event. The record was\ncopied into the registre of Brabant, from a letter written on April 22nd,\n1429, by a Flemish diplomatist, De Rotselaer, then at Lyons.1 De\nRotselaer had the prophecy from an officer of the court of the Dauphin.\nThe prediction was thus noted on April 22nd, the event occurred on\nMay 7th. On the fifth day of the trial Jeanne announced that, before\nseven years were gone, the English would lose a dearer gage than\nOrleans ; \" this I know by revelation, and am wroth that it is to be so\nlong deferred.\" Mr. Myers observes that \" the prediction of a great\nvictory over the English within seven years was not fulfilled in any\nexact way.\" The words of the Maid are \" Angli demittent majus vadium\nquam fecerunt coram Aurelianis,\" and, as prophecies go, their loss of\nParis (1436) corresponds very well to the Maid's announcement. She\nwent on, indeed, to say that the English \" will have greater loss than ever\nthey had, through a great French victory,\" but this reads like a gloss\non her original prediction. \" She knew it as well as that we were\n1 Prodi, IV., 425.\ns\n\f206 Andrew I.ang.\nthere.\" (Proces I., 84). \" You shall not have the exact year, but well\nI wish it might be before the St. John ; \" however, she had already\nexpressed her sorrow that this was not to be. \" Perhaps some English\nwill fall before Martinmas,\" a vague and not unsafe, but rather annoy\ning remark ! Asked, on March 1st, whether her liberation was\npromised, she said, \"Ask me in three months, and I will tell you.\" In\nthree months exactly, her stainless soul was free.\nOn the appearance, garb, and so on of her saints, she declined to\nanswer questions.\nShe had once disobeyed her voices, when they forbade her to leap\nfrom the tower of Beaurevoir. She leaped, but they forgave her, and\ntold her that Compi&gne (where she was captured on May 23rd, 1430)\nwould be relieved \" before Martinmas.\" It was relieved on October\n26th, after a siege of five months. On March 10th an effort was made to\nprove that her voices had lied to her, and that she had lied about her\nvoices. The enemy maintained that on May 23rd, 1430, she announced\na promised victory to the people of Compiegne, vowing that St. Mar\ngaret and St. Catherine had revealed it to her. Two hostile priests of\nCompiegne were at Rouen, and may have carried this tale, which is re\nported by two Burgundian chroniclers, but not by Monstrelet, who was\nwith the besieging army. I have examined the evidence in Macmillan's\nMagazine for May, 1894, and, to myself, it seems inadequate. In court\nshe said n'exist autre commandement de yssir. She was not asked\nwhether she had pretended to have received such an order. She told\nthe touching story of how, at Melun, on April, 1430, the voices had\nwarned her that she would be taken prisoner before midsummer ; how\nshe had prayed for death, or for tidings as to the day and hour. But\nno tidings were given to her, and her old belief, often expressed, that\nshe \" should last but one year or little more \" was confirmed. The Due\ndAlencon had heard her say this several times ; for the prophecy at\nMelun we have only her own word.\nShe was now led into the allegory about the Angel (herself) and the\nCrown (the coronation at Rheims). This allegory was fatal, but does\nnot bear on her real belief about her experiences. She averred, return\ning to genuine confessions, that her voices often came spontaneously ;\nif they did not, she summoned them by a simple prayer to God. She\nhad seen the angelic figures moving, invisible save to her, among men.\nThe voices had promised her the release of Charles d'Orleans, but time\nhad failed her. This was as near a confession of failure as she ever\nmade, till the day of her burning ; if she really made one then. But here,\nas always, she had predicted that she would do this or that if she were\nsans empeschement. She had no revelation bidding her attack Paris\nwhen she did, and after the day at Melun, she submitted to the advice\nof the other captains. By the way, if this be so, not she, but the\n\fThe Voices of Jeanne d' Arc. 207\ncaptains, displayed the strategy admired by Captain Marin in the\nOise campaign of 1430. As to her release, she was only bidden \"to\nbear all cheerfully ; he not vexed with thy martyrdom, thence shalt\nthou come at last into the kingdom of Paradise.\"\nTo us, this is explicit enough, but the poor child explained to her\nmurderers that by martire she understood the pains of prison and she\nreferred it to her Lord, whether there were more to bear. In this\npassage the original French exists, as well as the Latin translation.\nThe French is better.\n\"Ne te chaille de ton martire, tu t'en vendras enfin en royaulme\nde Paradis.\"\n\"Non cures de martyrio tuo : tu venies finaliter in regnum para-\nqbL\"\nThe word hinc is omitted in the bad Latin. Unluckily we have\nonly a fragment of the original French, as taken down in court.\nThis passage, with some others, may perhaps be taken as indicating\nthat the contents of the communications received by Jeanne were not\nalways intelligible to her. Those who believe in a kind of plurality of\npersonalities may put their own interpretation on this fact. Hut as\nfar as I have read, people who, like \" Leonie,\" have several selves are\npeople in all ways very unlike Jeanne d'Arc.\nThat her saints could be, and were, touched physically by her, she\nadmitted. (I. 185.) Here I am inclined to think that she had\ntouched with her ring, (as the custom was), a relic of St. Catherine,\nat Fierbois. Such relics, brought from the desert of Sinai, lay at\nKerbois, and we know that women loved to rub their rings on the\nring of Jeanne, in spite of her laughing remonstrances. But apart\nfrom this conjecture, she regarded her saints as tangible by her. She\nhad embraced both St. Margaret and St. Catherine. (I. 186.)\nFor the rest, Jeanne recanted her so-called recantation, averring\nthat she was unaware of the contents, or full significance of the\ndocument. Her voices recalled her to her duty, for them she went to\nthe stake, and, as I have shewn, if there was a moment of wavering\non the day of her doom, her belief in the objective reality of the\nphenomena remained firm, and she recovered her faith in the agony\nof her death.\nOf external evidence as to these experiences, the best is probably\nthat of d'Aulon, the Maitre d'Hotel of the Maid, and hor companion\nthrough her whole career. He and she were reposing in the same\nroom at Orleans, her hostess being in the chamber (May, 1429),\nand dAnion had just fallen asleep, when the Maid awoke him with a\nsry. Her voices bade her go against the English, but in what\ndirection she knew not. In fact, the French leaders had begun,\nwithout her knowledge, an attack on St. Loup, whither she galloped\n8 2\n\f208 Andrew I.ang.\nand took the fort. (III. 212.) It is, of course, very possible that\nthe din of onset, which presently became audible, had vaguely\nreached the senses of the Maid. Her page confirms d'Aulon's\ntestimony.\nD'Aulon states that when the Maid had any martial adventure in\nprospect, she told him that her \" counsel \" had given her this or that\nadvice. He questioned her as to the nature of this \" counsel.\" She\nsaid \"she had three councillors, of whom one was always with her, a\nsecond went and came to her, and the third was he with whom the\nothers deliberated.\" D'Aulon \"was not worthy to see this counsel.\"\nFrom the moment when he heard this, dAulon asked no more ques\ntions. Dunois also gave some evidence as to the \" counsel.\" At\nLoches, when Jeanne was urging the journey to Rheims, Harcourt\nasked her, before the King, what the nature (modus) of the council\nwas ; how it communicated with her. She replied that when she was\nmet with incredulity, she went apart and prayed to God. Then she\nheard a voice say, Fille DJ, va, va, va, je serai a ton aide, va ! u And\nwhen she heard that voice she was right glad, and would fain be ever\nin that state.\" \" As she spoke thus, ipsa miro modo exsultabat, levando\nsuos oculos ad cmlum\" (III., 12). Finally, that Jeanne maintained her\nbelief to the moment of her death, we learn from the priest, Martin\nLadvenu, who was with her to the last (III., 170). There is no sign\nanywhere that at the moment of an \" experience,\" the Maid's aspect\nseemed unusual, or uncanny, or abnormal, in the eyes of those who\nwere in her company.\nThese depositions were given twenty years later, (1452-56) and, of\ncourse, allowance must be made for weakness of memory and desire to\nglorify the Maid. But there is really nothing of a suspicious character\nabout them. In fact the \" growth of legend \" was very slight, and is\nmainly confined to the events of the martyrdom, the White Dove, the\nName of Christ blazoned in flame, and so forth. It should also have\nbeen mentioned that at the taking of St. Pierre de Moustier (Novem\nber, 1429) Jeanne, when deserted by her forces, declared to d'Aulon\nthat she was \" not alone, but surrounded by fifty thousand of her own.\"\nThe men therefore rallied and stormed the place.\nThis is the sum of the external evidence as to the phenomena. I\nhave already indicated what is known as to the mental and physical\ncharacteristics of the Maid. Her extreme temperance should also\nperhaps be remembered. M. Quicherat writes as if hysterical patients\noccasionally fell from great heights \"sans lesion,\" as Jeanne leaped\nfrom the donjon of Beaurevoir. This may be left to the consideration\nof physicians.\nAs to the contents of the communications to Jeanne, they were\n.certainly sane, judicious and heroic. M. Quicherat, (Apercus Nou\n\fTfie Voices of Jeanne d'Arc. 209\nveaux, p. 61) distinguishes three classes of abnormally conveyed\nknowledge, all on unimpeachable evidence.\n(1.) Thought-reading, as in the case of the King's secret ; she\nrepeated to him the words of a prayer which he had made mentally.\n(2.) Clairvoyance, as exhibited in the affair of the sword of Fierbois.\n(3.) Prescience, as in the prophecy of her arrow-wound at Orleans.\nAccording to her confessor, Pasquerel, she repeated the prophecy and\nindicated the spot in which she would be wounded (under the right\nshoulder) on the night of May 6. But this is later evidence given in\nthe Trial of Rehabilitation.\nTo these we might add the view, from Vaucouleurs, a hundred\nleagues away, of the defeat at Rouvray; the prophecy that she \"would\nlast but a year or little more;\" the prophecy, at Melun, of her capture;\nthe prophecy of the relief of Compiegne ; and the strange affair of the\nbon conduit at the battle of Pathay.1 For several of these predictions\nwe have only the Maid's word, but, to be plain, we can scarcely have\nmore unimpeachable testimony.\nHere the compiler leaves his task : the inferences may be drawn\nby experts. The old theory of imposture, the Voltairean theory of a\n\"poor idiot,\" are untenable. The honesty and the genius of Jeanne\nare no longer denied. If hysteria be named, it is plain that we must\nargue that, because hysteria is accompanied by visionary symptoms, all\nvisions are proofs of hysteria. Michelet holds by hallucinations which\nwere unconsciously externalised by the mind of Jeanne. That mind\nmust have been a very peculiar intellect, and the modus is precisely the\ndifficulty. But \" Miss X.\" avers that, being a strong visualiser, she\noften sees her impressions objectively before her, \" as a picture.\" I do\nnot gather that she also hears, touches, and smells them, as Jeanne did.\nHenri Martin believes in some kind of manifestation revealed to the\nindividual mind by the Absolute. Many Catholics, as yet unauthorised,\nI conceive, by the Church, accept the theory of Jeanne herself ; her\nsaints were true saints from Paradise. It is manifest that visions of a\nbright light and \"auditions\" of voices are common enough phenomena\nin madness, and in the experiences of very uninspired men and women,\ncollected and published by the S.P.R. From the sensations of these\npeople, Jeanne's phenomena are only differentiated by their number,\nby their persistence through seven years of an almost abnormally\nhealthy life, by their importance, orderliness and veracity, as well as\nby their heroic character.\nMr. Myers has justly compared the case of Jeanne with that of\nSocrates. A much humbler parallel, curiously close in one respect,\nmay be cited from M. Janet's article, Les Actes Inconscients dans le\n1 IV., 371. 372. Here the authority is Monatrelet, a Burgundian.\n\f210 Andrew Lang.\nSomnambulisme (Revue Philosophique, March, 1888). Mr. Myers\nanalyses and comments on this essay in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. V.,\nPart XIII., p. 374.\nThe case is that of Madame B., a peasant woman near Cherbourg.\nShe has her common work-a-day personality, called, for convenience,\n\" Leonie.\" There is also her hypnotic personality, \" Leontine.\" Now\nLeontine (that is, Madame B. in a somnambulistic state,) was one day\nhysterical and troublesome. Suddenly she exclaimed in terror that she\nheard a voice on the left, crying, \"Enough, be quiet, you are a nuisance.\"\nShe hunted in vain for the speaker, who, of course, was inaudible to\nM. Janet, though he was present. The sagacious speaker, so to say, is\n\" brought out \" by repeated passes, and when this moral and sensible\nphase of her character is thus evoked, Madame B. is \" Leonore.\"\nMadame B. now sometimes assumes an expression of beatitude,\nsmiling and looking upwards. As Dunois said of Jeanne when she\nwas recalling her visions, \" miro modo exsultabat levando suos oculos\nad coelum.\" This ecstacy Madame B. (as Lebnore) dimly remembers,\naverring that \" she has been dazzled by a light on the left side.\" Here\napparently we have the best aspect of poor Madame B. revealing\nitself in a mixture of hysterics and hypnotism, and associating itself\nwith an audible sagacious voice and a dazzling light on the left, both\nhallucinatory.\nThe coincidence with Jeanne's earliest experience is most curious.\nAudivit vocem a dextero latere .... claritas est ab eoditn\nlatere in quo vox audilur, sed ibi communiler est magna claritat.\nLike Madame B., Jeanne was at first alarmed by these sensations.\nThe parallel, so far, is perfectly complete. But in Jeanne's case, I\nhave found no hint of temporary unconsciousness. When strung up to\nthe most intense mental eagerness in court, she still heard her voices,\nthough, because of the tumult of the assembly, she heard them indis\ntinctly. Thus her experiences are not associated with insanity, partial\nunconsciousness, or any physical disturbance (as in some tales of second\nsight), while the sagacity of the communications and their veracity\ndistinguish them from the hallucinations of mad people and of Cotton\nMather. As far as the affair of Rouvray, the prophecy of the instant\ndeath of an insolent soldier at Chinon, (evidence of Pasquerel, her con\nfessor), and such things go, we have, of course, many alleged parallels in\nthe predictions of Mr. Peden and other seers of the Covenant. But Mr.\nPeden's political predictions are still unfulfilled, whereas concerning\nthe \" dear gage \" which the English should lose in France within seven\nyears, Jeanne may be called successful.\nOn the whole, if we explain Jeanne's experiences as the expressions\nof her higher self (as Leonore is Madame B.'s higher self), we are com\npelled to ask what is the nature of that self? To one inquirer it seems\n\fThe Voices of Jeanne d'Arc. 211\nlike \"something far more deeply interfused\" than any mental con\ncomitant of the cerebral organism.\nThe evidence for knowledge acquired by no familiar natural channel\nof sense sufficed to convince M. Quicherat, whom Pere Ayroles regards\nas a free-thinker. Nor have I exhausted all the alleged instances,\nfrom a dislike to drawing on the evidence given in 1452-1456.\nIn the whole story I am struck by the comparative lack of\nmiraculous undergrowth of legend. Moreover, when we remember our\ncurrent theories of collective hallucinations propagated by enthusiasm,\nor feigned by enthusiasts, when we remember that the legend of the\ncontemporary St. Colette is a tissne of such tales as are told about\nD. D. Home, it seems odd that even the later reports concerning\nJeanne are so temperate. Nobody pretends to have heard voices in\nher company, to have seen lights or saints, to have beheld her elevated\nin air, or even to have seen her chair snatched away, like St. Colette's,\nby invisible hands ! When I say, \" nobody,\" I should make an\nexception, perhaps, for a Monsieur de Cailly. If a Grant of Arms,\nnow existing only in a copy made about 1610 by Charles du Lys, is\nauthentic, Monsieur de Cailly shared with Jeanne at Orleans, in May,\n1429, a vision of Angels. The Grant of Arras, permitting him to bear\nthree Angels' heads, avers that Jeanne herself, in June, 1429, begged\nfor him this favour. The copyist, Charles du Lys, married a Mademois\nelle de Cailly, and doubtless copied a document belonging to her\nfamily. Jeanne healed no diseases, and refused credit for the\nmomentary recovery of a new-born child at Lagny, in April, 1430.\nThus it seems that \" contagious enthusiasm in a credulous age,\" even\nin the presence of one who was herself a miracle, does not always\ngenerate a rich undergrowth of legend.\nI began by saying that I could find no work on Jeanne d'Arc by\na psychological expert. The remarks of Brierre de Boismont are\nsingularly inadequate. The sun flashing on the church window caused\nthe first experience, and so forth. How much does the sun flash,\noutside, from a medieval window of stained glass 1 A few attempts\nat a pathological explanation rest on a late rumour reported at third\nhand. I have not consulted the Zoist, Vol. XIII., p. 257. The Comte\nde Bourbon Lignieres, while he assails the theory of hallucinations, is\nhardly to be regarded as himself a scientific expert. Finally, I have\nbeen unable to procure an essay by Captain Marin, in which,\naccording to M. Lanery dArc, he regards the apparitions to Jeanne as\nobjective, and of the same spiritualistic category as the famous Katie\nKing.\nTo state the facts, with some criticism of the evidence, has been\nmy sole object, nor can I add a conjecture to the many unsatisfactory\nhypotheses about this mystery of the Maid. Were I compelled to\n\f212 Andrew I.ang.\npronounce an opinion, it would be to some such effect as this : Follow\ning Brierre de Boismont as against Lelut, I should think that persons\nentirely sane may be so constituted as to see and hear, as if externally,\ntheir ideas and mental impressions.\nIt would be impossible for Jeanne, as it was for Socrates, to regard\nthese experiences as other than objective and caused by external\ninfluences. Thus I should have no hesitation about considering her\nexperiences mere constitutional externalisations of her ideas. But\nthe evidence showing that the contents of the messages received by\nher were such as she could not have learned in any normal way is so\nstrong that I am compelled to believe in some abnormal extension of\nfaculty, corresponding to her native and unparalleled genius. To a\ncertain extent, she was admitted within the arcana and sanctuary of\nthe universe.\n\" Come to the Salp^triere,\" said a man of science to an Abbe\\\n\" and I will show you twenty Jeannes d'Arc.\" \" Has one of them\ngiven us back Alsace and Lorraine 1 \" said the Abbe\\\nThere is the crux.\n\fResolute Credulity. 2i:i\nin.\nRESOLUTE CREDULITY.\nBy Frederic W. H. Myers.\nThe work of the Society for Psychical Research in its own\nsphere resembles in some important points that of the Charity\nOrganisation Society in the sphere of almsgiving. The C.O.S. has had\nto deal with a widespread and worthy although often an ill-directed\nand even ruinous impulse\u2014the impulse to relieve the physical\nwants of other men. In its endeavours to guide that impulse into the\nbest channels the C.O.S. encounters two contrasted, or rather comple\nmentary, forms of evil. On the one side there is the credulity, the\nindolence, the vanity of the reckless giver ; on the other side there is\nthe helplessness, the fraud, the vice and cruelty which the ill-judged\nboons encourage or engender. We too, on our part, deal with a wide\nspread and noble impulse ;\u2014although an impulse whose misdirection\nhas made the saddest side of human history. Our motive power is\nfurnished by man's innate longing to penetrate the Realm Unseen ;\u2014\nthat world-old desire which is now taking on itself a new definiteness\nand intensity as science is accustoming men's minds to a standard of\nmore assured and verifiable certainty than contented the aspirations of\nearlier men.\nAnd we meet in this inquiry also those two complementary causes\nof error which make earthly charity so hard to dispense aright. On\nthe one side we too often find credulity, indolence, vanity ; on the\nother side the fraud and falsehood which that credulity generates\nand that indolence allows. For us also, as for the C.O.S., it is needful\nfrom time to time to utter a word of warning ; to define anew the\nspirit in which we hold that high truth should be sought ; to point\nout some blind pathways which as yet have led only to deceit and\ndisillusion.\nOnce more then I must repeat, (since men on the side both of\nbelief and of negation seem slow to understand it), that our very\nraison d'etre as a Society is that we endeavour to be scientific and not\npartisan ; that the persons of widely different views and experiences\nwho compose our group unite only in the strong desire to be careful,\nthorough, dispassionate ; since we know well that in that temper only\nshall we arrive at truth.\n\" We exist,\"\u2014to quote a letter written by Edmund Gurney and\nmyself to the S.P.R. Journal for January 1887,\u2014\" we exist in order to\n\f214 Frederic W. H. Myers.\ncarry, if we can, the methods of recognised science into a region where no\nrecognised science as yet has forced its way. And we appeal with equal\nsincerity to each of the groups which stand aloof from us on either\nside, to help us in the task which we have undertaken. To those who\ndeem us credulous we say, ' Criticise our methods, and we will do our\nbest to improve them. Attack our evidence, and we will strengthen or\nabandon it.' And to those who think us over-sceptical we say similarly,\n' Offer us more and better evidence, and you will find that there is\nnothing to which we oppose a mere a priori denial,\u2014no case which we\nwill not set forth with candour and criticise with care.' \"\nOur history during the eight years since these words were written\nhas not, I hope, been inconsistent with their tenor. We have set forth\nmuch fresh evidence ; and among it much evidence to phenomena for\nwhich, when we began our labours, there was little testimony which\nseemed to stand examination. My own writings, especially, are likely\nto be oftener attacked as exhibiting an excessive, than an insufficient,\ntendency to belief. It may therefore be useful if I here enumerate\ncertain theses for which we have not, in my view, received evidence\nenough to give them even a primd facie claim to be regarded as true.\nThese unproved theses, however, are not all on the same footing.\nSome of them might conceivably be established to-morrow. To believe\nin others of them indicates, I think, that resolute, predetermined\ncredulity against which it is the purpose of this paper to protest. But\nof all alike I may say that the man who alludes to any one of these\ntheses as true is bound, in my view, at the same time to state or refer\nto the definite and provable facts which justify his conclusion. In all\ncases alike, however, he will probably prefer simply to say that the\nexisting evidence is too voluminous to be printed on that particular\noccasion.\nThesis 1.\u2014There is such a thing as \"Occult Science\" or Magic ;\nand supernormal powers, especially in the East, are trans\nmitted by tradition, or acquired by ascetic practices, so that\nthe possessors of such powers can understand and control\nthem.\nI was once disposed to believe in the truth of some parte at\nleast of this thesis, but the study of various books and periodicals\nwritten to defend it has destroyed that tendency to belief.1 Dr.\nHodgson's paper on \"Indian Magic\" (S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. IX.,\np. 354) was not calculated to reassure me. Since that paper was\nwritten, however, some articles by \" Heinrich Hensoldt, Ph.D.,''\n1 I do not of course mean to assert that there may not be tricks depending on\nsuggestion, or even on telepathy, which may be handed down in country places and\nmay enter into \"folk-lore,\"\u2014a very different matter from the claim discussed above.\n\fResolute Credulity. 215\nhave appeared in the Arena (an American monthly magazine which\ngives some space to these topics), which articles, if true, establish\nall the occultism that could be desired. Dr. Hodgson and I examined\nthese papers, and concluded that they were entirely unworthy of\nnotice Mr. Stead printed a story of Dr. Hensoldt's in Borderland ;\nbat with reserve, as \"one of a series of articles which were undoubtedly\nthrilling, and might be true.\" It is fortunate that he did so, as this\nled to an interview in which Dr. Hensoldt told Mr. Stead \" that\nin the main he was quite sure that his facts were correct. but\nthat he had written them up a little.\" 1 In Borderland for April,\n1895, p. 168, Mr. Stead prints, along with this statement of Dr.\nHensoldt's, an article from the Ceylon Observer (date not given), from\nwhich, if no answer is forthcoming, it certainly appears that Dr.\nHensoldt's story was a tissue of deliberate falsehoods. As Dr.\nHensoldt has been lecturing in America, and \"has been much pleased\nby the universal interest which his discourses upon Indian occultism\nhave roused among the educated classes of the United States,\" it is to\nbe hoped that the Arena will presently educate those classes a little\nfurther in his direction.\nTlusis 2.\u2014Mahatmas exist in Thibet ; Mme. Blavatsky's occult per\nformances and those of her friends were genuine,\u2014and (this\nlast clause is now optional) have been continued since her\ndeath by Mr. Judge.\nI do not propose to say anything more on all this. History tells us\nthat Moseilana after the death of Mahomet introduced an egg into a\nbottle, and by the marvel of that s'igh^ shook the prestige of the\nProphet and balanced for some months the destinies of Islam.\nAn egg in a bottle ! One might exhibit an apple in a dumpling to\nMr. Judge's admirers, and ask them triumphantly what they had to\nsay to thai.\nThesis 3.\u2014The heavenly bodies indicate or influence in an occult\nway the destinies of men.\nI do not know on what evidence this belief is based.\nThesis i.\u2014The lines in a man's hand indicate his history, character,\nand destiny.\nI have seen no evidence of any value for this proposition.\nThesis 5.\u2014By the act of bathing in or drinking the water of\nthe spring at Lourdes, or of other sacred springs ; or by\n1 We are quite familiar in the S.P.E. with the genial admission of \" writing up a\nlittle.\" It has put a sudden end to many correspondences.\n\f216 Frederic W. H. Myers.\ninvocations of a special kind ; or by the practice of a\n\" Christian Science,\" which can be learnt from books and\nlectures, therapeutic results are attained which differ in kind\nfrom those which ordinary suggestion or self-suggestion,\nwithout any of these adjuncts, occasionally produces.\nOn this point I may refer to a paper by my late brother and myself\nin Proceedings, Vol. IX, p. 1 60, and to a discussion of the Holywell cures\nby the Rev. A. T. Fryer in the S.P.R. Journal for May, 1895. Since\nthe article in Proceedings M. Zola's work on Lourdes has appeared, and\nhas been recognised on both sides as a serious study of the problem.\nHis descriptions from personal observation of the constatation or\nproof of the cures\u2014descriptions whose accuracy has not, so far as\nI know, been seriously questioned\u2014are absolutely confirmatory of the\nconclusions drawn, from mere study of the literature favourable to\nLourdes, by my brother and myself.1\nI will add that I am personally very anxious that some part of the\nabove thesis should be proved true ;\u2014that is to say that some method\nshould be found by which the processes of therapeutic self-suggestion,\nat present so rarely effective, should be made more certain and\nmore profoundly efficacious. I cannot but think that there must\nbe some such method ; but I see little evidence that it has yet\nbeen found.\nThesis 6.\u2014Some public showmen now use in their exhibitions some\nform of supernormal power.\nI should be very willing to believe this thesis, which would show\nmore regularity in the operation of telepathy or clairvoyance than we\nhave ever seen attained in experiments. But I see no proof that\nit is true of any public performer at the present time ; and I shall\npresently quote two cases where supernormal powers which audiences\nhave believed to exist can be shown to be in no wise needed to explain\nthe phenomena. On the other hand I remember that when some of\nour group were learning and buying tricks from a conjurer, some twenty\nyears ago, she told us that it was not worth our while to buy her code-\ntrick, because her occasional specially good hits depended, as she be\nlieved, on thought-transference from the man who went round looking\nat the articles which she guessed. She said that she was obliged to\npay this man, who was not in other respects useful, because she found\nthat she could not get the same clear knowledge of objects from other\nconfederates equally trained in the code. This is no proofof super-\ni A narrative given by Dr. Pierre Delbet (Revue dc Parit, 1895, p. 628) suggests\nconsiderable doubt as to the good faith of some of the religious bodies who announce\ncures.\n\fResolute Credulity. 217\nnormal powers ; but it is nearer proof than is the mere fact that many\nspectators have been puzzled by many codes.1\nThetis 7. \u2014 Some public mediums now giving seances are pro\nducing genuine phenomena of movements at a distance or of\nmaterialisation.\nI do not feel by any means certain that this thesis is wholly false.\nBelieving as I do that genuine phenomena occur both through Eusapia\nFaladino and through various private persons known to me ; and\nbelieving also that genuine phenomena have at one time or other\noccurred through more than one public medium, it would not surprise me\nto receive proof that something genuine was thus occurring now. But\nwhen I consider the great difference between the care and skill which\nWe been devoted to the investigation of Eusapia (I am of course not\nthinking of my own minute share in that long inquiry) and the kind of\nobservation on which other contemporary claims are mainly based, I\nfeel bound to draw the line as I have done.\nI shall presently give accounts of two sittings with Mr. Husk, which\nillustrate the modest equipment of capacity on which a toi-disant medium\ncan live and prosper. But the most important source of information\non this subject is a pamphlet compiled by Mr. John Curtis, of Boston,\nwith a preface by the late Colonel Bundy, of Chicago, editor of the\nRdigio-PhUosophical Journal. Colonel Bundy firmly believed in the\ngenuineness of some of these phenomena, and the newspaper which he\nedited was distinctly spiritualistic ; but with admirable courage and\ndisinterestedness he made it a large part of his business to expose the\nlThe reader may refer to Borderland for July, 1894, p. 422, for Miss X.'s\naccount of the performance of Mr. Jesse Shepard, the \"musical medium,''\u2014an\naccount concordant with the view of other competent musical critics. There is no\nreason whatever to credit Mr. Shepard with any powers more supernormal than a\nhigh falsetto voice and a judicious use of the left elbow.\nMr. Hamilton Aid\u00e9 has favoured me with the following graphic description of\none of Mr. Shepard's seances ;\u2014charge, a guinea a head for each auditor :\u2014\n\"Shepard informed me that he was an uncultured musician\u2014a statement which\nhis subsequent performance fully verified ; also, that he was inspired at wiil by the\nspirits of Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, etc. This was a greater demand on my\ncredulity. And yet I believe there are many who have swallowed the astounding\npretension without difficulty. The spirit of a young lady in the schoolroom was,\napparently, the one who descended upon S.'s shoulders, arms, and hands (and\ndescended heavily, too) on this occasion. As long as he played in full\nlamplight his performance was beneath criticism. When the room was reduced to\ntotal darkness and he played what he termed \" The Passage of the Israehtes over\nthe Red Sea,\" a curious and clever effect to imitate the trampling of horses and\nrambling of chariots was produced by\u2014what part of his body or what mechancial\ncontrivance I know not, but clearly the thing was a trick. Of his vocal powers,\nthich he justly considers abnormal, I can truly say that anything so terrible and\nhideous I never heard issue from the human throat\u2014varying from the roarnf a bull\nto the screech of a mackaw.

I have felt a\nsimilar wish when I have seen a man who had dined toss half-a-crowa\nto a maudlin woman in the rainy street, while she pinched the hired baby-\nthat she was slowly murdering for the sake of those very half-crowns.-\nI proceed now to some of the concrete cases of which I have spoken\n1 Dr. Hodgson writes to me : \" Mr. Curtis has in his possession masses of material\ntaken from Mrs. Hannah V.

We hold all this in readiness for printing, if required ;\nbut after reviewing much of what has already been printed on both sides of the\ncontroversy, I think that the evidence for widespread fraud throughout all this\ngroup is already so strong and the evidence for genuine phenomena anywhere in the\ngroup so weak, that few of our readers can need further caution.\n- 1 am afraid that Mr. A.

Roughly speaking, we have to meet three main modes of\nproducing illusion. There is the skilful use of natural forces ; there is\nthe employment of confederates ; and, last not least, there is simple\n\" suggestion \"\u2014some would call it sheer effrontery\u2014supported by\ndarkness and by appropriate \" patter.\"\nI quote first Professor Lodge's account of Mrs. Abbott's exhibition :\u2014\nOn The Mechanical Performance of Mm. Abbott, Recently\nAdvertised as \"The Georgia Maonbt.\"\nMy attention has been called to an article by Dr. Henri (ioudard in the\nJan.-Feb., 1895, number of the Annates des Sciences Psychiitues, wherein that\ngentleman relates his experience with Miss or Mrs. Abbott in Paris, finds\nhimself unable to agree with the short summary quoted correctly as embody\ning my opinion by Professor Richet, and asks me to state at greater length\nwhy I recognise nothing abnormal in the performance.\nI will answer his courteously worded request briefly, but I hope definitely.\nThe extracts given by Dr. Goudard from the \" Figaro \" are not scientific\nor precise in their terms. I pass at once to the experience of Dr. Goudard\nhimself, as described by him in the paper referred to.\n\/.\u2014A man IuAdsa chairfirmly against his chest and is then puslml about\nby tlu operator, irho appears to exert wry little force on the chair.\nThe experiment is easily repeated by anybody, and the subject of it is\nusually surprised at the apparent strength of the person operating. The right\nhand of the operator need exert no force at all, and it is to this hand that\nintention is directed ; force is exerted by the left hand near the chest of the\npatient, and in an unexpected direction, first pushing and then Ilulling, or\nrice versa. It is the unexpected and sudden variation of the force which\nthrows the patient off his balance, especially if he has strongly braced him\nself to meet and oppose a force in the wrong direction.\nI do not remember having seen Experiment II., so I pass on to the next,\nwhich is an important one.\nIII.\u2014The operator stands on one foot holding a billiard-cue while a tall\nstrong man is then asked to push her backicards by steady pressure on the cue,\nandfaHs.\nTo succted with this experiment the operator must be short and strong in\nthe arms. When a tall person is pushing against a short person he is push\ning largely downwards, and by standing on a heel the body of the short\nperson can become a strut almost in the direction of the force. If she can\nthen maintain her arms rigid there is no chance of pushing her backwards.\nUntimely and unexpected pushes are not permitted, and if the cue is lowered\nso that the pushing becomes more horizontal, she abandons it for a time and\nrests or changes the person ; the rules of the game have to be adhered to if\nthe experiment is to succeed. With the cue held well up, a short strong\nwoman can repeat the experiment, as I have verified. When four or five\nmen push on the same cue they get in each other's way\u2014the cue bends so\nthat the end men refrain from exerting much force, and the thing degenerates\nlargely into a farce.\n\f220 Frederic W. H. Myers.\nWith one or two men the experiment is certainly surprising, but it is\nsimply and purely mechanical. A man pushing somewhat downwards can\nexert singularly little propulsive force. The magnitude of it depends on the\nposition of his centre of gravity and the amount by which a vertical through\nit outlies his toes. He stands on one leg and instinctively throws the weight\nof his other leg forward to get as much moment as he can, but the fact that\nthe position of this free leg makes a material difference shows how slight is\nthe force really exerted. On the other hand a person standing on a heel and\npushing upward and forwards is in a position to sustain a very considerable\nload.\nThe conditions are entirely reversed when the force exerted is a pull\ninstead of a push. A tall heavy man has then a great advantage. Tug of\nwar in a standing position depends upon weight and height ; and if Mrs.\nAbbott had been able to engage successfully in a tug of war with me, it\nwould have been a direct proof of something abnormal. I spent altogether\nsome hours fruitlessly in trying to persuade her and her exhibitors to permit\nme to try in private any form of pulling experiment. But the most\nfrivolous pretexts were brought forward, such as the presence of a carpet\non the floor, etc., and the test was resolutely declined.\nIV.\u2014She holds a billiard cue in a slanting, nearly vertical position, and askt\nsome one to force its point to the ground by sliding it along her open palms.\nThis experiment can be repeated by any one with strong enough arras.\nIt was not so invariably successful with Mrs. Abbott, and is not one of her\nbest tricks. If the operator can get an energetic person to push vigorously,\nthe friction of the open palms is sufficient to prevent the cue from sliding,\n(again rather surprising, but easily verifiable), but if a languid person,\nwithout pushing against the operator, simply exerts force in the direction\nof the cue's length, it slides down with perfect ease. A practised exhibitor\nis, however, prepared for this, and is able to evade the attempt, or to dis\ncount it in some way.\nI remember the stethoscopic feat numbered V., but I was not impressed\nby it. Perhaps I too ignorantly accredit the human body with the power\nof purposely generating slight sounds when they are listened for\nattentively.\nVI.\u2014She presents her elbows to a person standing behind her, and requests\nto be lifted by them. Sometimes she can thus be lifted, sometimes the cannot.\nThis experiment is certainly singular. It appears that this mode of\nraising a person is not far from the margin of what is possible without\noverbalancing oneself. One has to stand rather vertically, and one has\nvery little moment adapted to support a weight placed in one's hands held\nout horizontally. If the operator holds her elbows well back the lifting\ncan be done, but if she draws them forward even slightly, the lifting cannot\nbe done. I conjecture that a man with extra long feet, and stiffly soled flat\nboots, and short fore-arms, would have an advantage in this mode of\nlifting, and might be able to succeed in lifting the person in spite of the\nawkward position of her elbows. The lifting can always be done if the\nelbows are forcibly drawn back first ; but this brings the dress and body\ninto contact, and that is not considered fair.\n\fResolute C-redulity. 221\nIt was not pretended that there was any real increase in weight such as\na balance could show, and in fact a rough balance test, improvised by Professor\nFitzgerald, tended to disprove any such increase. It is therefore quite\ndifferent from the levitations testified to by Mr. Crookes. The effect\nonly pretends to be subjective, i.e., one to be tested by a human being.\nA human being so arranged as a balance is a deceptive one, and his margin\nof lifting is very narrow, owing to the small basis afforded by his feet. A\nlever or bracket projecting from a pillar standing in a pair of human boots\nwould have very little lifting power, especially if the weight were applied\nsomewhat far out towards the free end.\nVII.\u2014She stands with her hands lightly agiiiiut a wall and then asks to be\npushed up to the wall by pressure on her back.\nThis is a modification of No. III. The pushing force of a man on a short\nperson is less than he expects, and the purchase given her by pressure mi the\nwall is precisely in the right direction and is sufficient to balance all the force\nnecessary. The palms of her hands may indeed be tested and found not to\ntouch the wall, but some part of her finger-tips always touches, and these\nfinger-nails will be seen to go white, indicating pressure. The experiment\nis easy enough for any one to do.\nI did not see experiment VIII., but conjecture that it depends on the\nknown fact that a child willing to be lifted and holding itself properly can\neasily be raised, whereas a child unwilling and limp is comparatively difficult\nto sustain. The reason, doubtless, depends on the mode of holding ; a mode\nwhich may be sufficient in the one case can be made quite inadequate in the\nother.\nIX.\u2014The apparent difficidty of being lifted is transmitted to another\nperson.\nWhen I saw this experiment it was performed thus :\u2014\nA loutish boy was called in, and his hands held with fore-arms horizontally\nby Mrs. Abbott. Any one was then asked to raise him by the ellwws,\nstanding behind him in the orthodox way. My opinion is, that when she\nwished him \" light \" she pushed his elbows a trifle back, and when she\nwished him \"heavy \" she drew them a little forward. That so small a\nmotion of the elbows makes all the difference constitutes the beauty of the\ntrick. In one case the weight is below, in the other it is above the load\npossible with the given condition of leverage. That is how I saw the perform\nance, but if I had seen it as Dr. Goudard apparently has seen it, tried with a\nchild of five years old, I should, I suppose, have been much more impressed.\nI cannot, of course, say what other circumstances might have modified\nthe view one would naturally have been compelled to take if the facts were\nprecisely as now described by him. -\nX.\u2014A billiard cue standing vertically on the ground is to be pressed down\nby fhe hands of a number ofpersons placed on the top of it, while a man who\nhas clambered up and perched himself there is seated upon these hands ; the\noperator then easily raises the cue, grasping it anywhere with one hand.\nThis is a sort of psychological experiment. If the reader pictures him\nself as one of those with hands on top of and pressing down the cue, he will\nt\n\f222 Frederic W. H. Myers.\nrealise that the consequences of a break in the cue appeal forcibly to his\nimagination, and it is not improbable that without knowing it he will be\nassisting to sustain the weight of the seated person, rather than doing what\nhe supposes every one else to be doing, viz., vigorously pressing down. Under\nthese conditions it is perhaps only surprising that the cue does not rise even\nwithout the gentle upward force exerted by the operator.\nXI.\u2014Five or six persons are sitting and sprawling on a chair, which the\noperator then momentarily raises or jerksfor an instant from the flwlr.\nThis experiment is performed with a special chair with a narrow and\nuncomfortable seat. The man to be seated is selected of a suitable height\nfor his feet to be well on the floor, and, by the time the other men have\nsprawled on his lap, most of their weight is really sustained by his legs and\nfeet, especially if the operator standing behind the chair begins to tilt it up.\nThe experiment is rather a farcical one, as the raising is only momentary and\nit results in a sprawl on the floor for the bodies insecurely propped, rather\nthan supported, by the chair.\nIt is, I know, asserted that very little force is exerted by the operator's\nhands ; it is also asserted that none is exerted by her knees. But in my\nexperience the tests for these two things are not made together, and the\ntilting or jerking up can be done either way, with the help of the fore-arms.\nWith a suitable chair it is an experiment which any one can try, and he may\nbe surprised to find how readily the necessary force can be exerted. If Mrs.\nAbbott does not do it by muscular exertion, why does she stand in precisely\nthat position which would be chosen by a person who had only muscular\nexertion to rely on ?\nI have now dealt, I hope sufficiently, with all the more important\nstatements of Dr. Goudard. I only answer for what I myself saw, but I\nwas not satisfied by one visit, nor did I come to a final conclusion till I had\ntried experiments with other persons of suitable size. It will be observed\nthat I conclude that the feats are ingeniously chosen to suit a short person,\nand that Mrs. Abbott, though small and in appearance frail, is probably\nvery muscular, at any rate in the arms. Perhaps Dr. Goudard noticed that\nher fore-arms exhibited more muscle than is common in her sex.\nI did not offer any public statement1 at the time she was exhibiting in\nEngland, beyond the bare fact that in my opinion there was nothing occult in\nthe matter, because I had no wish to injure the exhibition, which was a\nfairly good and entertaining exhibition of well chosen feats of strength and\nskill. Nothing shown to me demanded the exercise of actual \" fraud \"; nor\nwas there any prominent subterfuge or pretence, beyond the name\n\"Magnet,\" which to the populace may signify anything or nothing. At any\nrate, the public who paid to see Mrs. Abbott's performance obtained full\nvalue for their money, and investigators were treated with a very fair amount\nof frankness even by her exhibitors ; and that she should decline to attempt\nfeats impossible to do by normal physics was after all perfectly legitimate as\na matter of business, which indeed the whole show was.\nOliver J. Lodge.\nMarch, 1895.\n1 The account given in the S.P.R. Journal, Vol. V., p. 16S, was not a publication.\n\fResolute Credulity. 223\nI have also three other first-hand, independent, and concordant\naccounts of Mrs. Abbott's muscular and other tricks\u2014(1) from James\nH. Hyslop, Professor of Logic and Ethics in Columbia College, New\nYork City ; (2) from the Rev. Solon Laner, known to Dr. Hodgson\n(account first printed in Religio-Philosophical Journal) ; (3) from Dr.\nHodgson himself.\nProfessor Hyslop's long and careful analysis is based upon notes\ntaken the day after the performance. He succeeded in himself\nrepeating almost all Mrs. Abbott's tricks, his agreement with Dr.\nLodge as to their modus operandi being very close. He takes, how\never, a more serious view of the amount of actual and conscious\nfalsehood in Mrs. Abbott's statements, and demurs, for instance, to\naccepting the same child as this lady's daughter one day and as a\ndisinterested stranger from among the audience the next.\nMr. Laner describes certain phenomena which Mrs. Abbott seems\nto have abstained from attempting in Professor Lodge's presence :\u2014\nOne of her cleverest performances was the weighing trick, which\ndeceived the audience and all the committee, including the man who did the\nweighing (a prestidigitator), I alone claiming it to be a trick, and showing\nthe method of its performance after the exhibition was over. The trick was\nas follows :\u2014First, Mrs. Abbott called for me to stand on the platform of an\nordinary pair of scales to be weighed. She instructed mo to stand on the\niron portion of the platform, which was about five inches wide, running\naround the platform. I stood with one foot on each side of the platform,\nmy weight being nearly in the middle of the platform, measuring length\nwise. In this position the weight registered was my normal weight, about\n140 pounds. Then I stepped off the scales, and Mrs. Abbott stepped on.\nBut she took a position differing from mine, as I observed. Her feet were\nplaced on the extreme rear of the platform, across the rear corners, her heels\nbeing just on the rim of the platform. I asked her to place one foot forward,\nbut she objected that she must stand on the iron portion. I remarked that\nthe iron extended all the way around the scales, but she still persisted in her\nposition. Standing thus, she easily caused her weight to fluctuate, by\ntipping up the front of the platform slightly, and then lowering it again,\nand the man who was weighing her was not able to move the weight fast\nenough to record the fluctuations.\nIt should be said before describing the second stage of this performance\nthat all members of the committee, save myself, were by her request seated\nat the rear of the stage, where they could not observe closely her position\non the scales. I had been standing near her, and when she began this\nperformance, sat down opposite the scales, where I had a favourable view.\nThe man at the scales was too busy with the weights to observe carefully.\nThe audience could not see the details on account of distance.\nThe second stage of the weighing trick was as follows :\u2014A small box was\nhanded round among the committee, and pronounced unsuspicious. It was\nthen placed behind the scales, and I noticed that it was just the height of\nthe platform, which it touched at the rear end. This box was ostensibly for\nt 2\n\f224 Frederic W. H. Myers.\na man to stand upon, in order that he might bear down on Mrs. Abbott's\nshoulders, as she stood upon the platform of the scales. When this man\nbore down upon her shoulders the scales registered many pounds less than\nher normal weight, (which she stated to be 98 pounds, but which, I should\nsay, was nearly 120 pounds). The explanation of this trick was very easy to\nme when I saw that her feet were so placed that her heels rested on the box\nbehind her, which thus relieved the scales of much of the weight of herself\nand of the man who was vigorously pushing down on her shoulders.\nThe third stage was as follows :\u2014A board smaller than the top of the\nplatform of the scales was placed on the platform, ostensibly for insulating\npersons. Then Mrs. Abbott invited the man who had previously pushed\ndown on her shoulders to now partially lift her from the scales, and while\nhe was doing this her weight was reported to be several pounds more than\nnormal. This trick was performed by pushing the board with her foot so\nthat it rested partly on the box, before the man who was to lift her had\nstepped upon the box. In the excitement he did not notice the board, and\nthus he and Mrs. Abbott were both standing on this board, one end of\nwhich rested upon the scales, throwing the greater part of their combined\nweight upon the platform. Although the man lifted her from the platform,\nhe still stood on the board, and thus did not lift her weight from the scales,\nbut rather added part of his own weight. The scales registered 150 pounds,\nif I remember rightly. This was the last performance on the programme,\nand without waiting for any report from the committee, the audience rushed\nout, exclaiming upon the marvellous things they had witnessed. The other\nmembers of the committee crowded around Mrs. Abbott expressing their\nprofound astonishment at her gifts. My own congratulations were upon the\nclever exhibition she had given, and were received with suspicion. The\nman who did the weighing was, he said, a prestidigitator, but failed to\nlearn the modus operandi of any of her tricks, but confessed himself satisfied\nwhen I did the scales trick, and allowed him to do the weighing as before.\nOther tricks would be difficult to describe in detail, but may be briefly\nmentioned. She produced a snapping noise on a tumbler, by holding it\nwith a handkerchief, slipping her thumb or finger along on the glass,\nproducing thus a noise like the crackling of electricity. I did the same\nafterward. A physician was called on the stage to take her temperature\nwith a clinical thermometer. He reported it to be three degrees below the\nnormal point, indicating an abnormal condition, which in a patient would\nbe considered very dangerous. I did the same thing the next day with a\nphysician's thermometer, by slyly inhaling through the lips, and exhaling\nthrough the nostrils, thus keeping a current of cold air playing on the tube\nof the thermometer, and putting the temperature at five degrees below the\nnormal, yet I still live.\nDr. Hodgson himself saw Mrs. Abbott in Boston in 1889, when\nshe must, he thinks, have been less expert than now. He pushed her\nagainst the wall, and forced the vertical cue to the ground, then\nrefused to endeavour to lift her unless allowed to stand on a chair.\nThis was imprudently permitted, and he then lifted her from the\nground with ease. At that date the exhibition, he thinks, was more\n\fResolute Citdulity. 225\ndefinitely spiritualistic, and therefore, under the circumstances, more\ndefinitely fraudulent, than it has been since she achieved a wider\nreputf.\nThe next case which I shall quote depends on the use of confederates.\nThe stern moralist might object to some of the private deceptions\nwhich seem to have been necessary to secure the public effect.\nMr. 6. A. Smith, from whom the account comes, is already known\nto readers of these Proceedings as an acute observer.\nBrighton, Dtcember, 1894.\n[After describing the great recent success at Brighton of Mrs. Baldwin's\n\"Somnomancy,\" Mr. G. A. Smith continues :\u2014]\nThe performance generally began with a cabiliet sealice, in which some\ntimes the \" Professor \" and sometimes his wife acted aa \"medium.\" This\nkind of exhibition is now too common to arouse much interest, so, although\nthis part of the show was patiently endured, it excited no enthusiasm. At\nits termination Professor Baldwin sent several assistants amongst the\naudience to distribute slips of paper and pencils, also small squares of mill\nboard to serve as desks. Some forty or fifty of these conveniences would be\ndistributed in different parts of the hall, the recipients being told that they\nmight write any question upon the paper, fold it up and stow it in their\npockets\u2014the pencils and mill-boards being then collected by the assistants\nand deposited on the stage in full view of the audience. The mill-boards\nwere ostensibly offered to prevent the inconvenience of writing upon the\nknee; the \"Professor\" frankly referred to the theory of preparation and\nridiculed it, stating that if any preferred to discard the mill-board they were\nat liberty to do so\u2014indeed they might use their own paper and pencils, and\nmight in fact write their questions at home and come to the hall with them\nsafely concealed in their pockets. The great thing was to keep the question\nvividly in mind, and it had been found by experience that to write it down\nthere and then was a help towards this end. He further said that he could\nonly control Mrs. Baldwin's \" visions \" to a very limited extent himself ; and\nonly an uncertain proportion of those who had written questions would be\nlikely to receive answers.\nAfter this business some serpentine dancing, some character songs, and a\nnigger were inflicted upon the audience, and then Mrs. Baldwin was led on\nwith her eyes bandaged and seated in the centre of the stage.\nHer method of procedure now was somewhat as follows:\u2014 \"There is a\nKate Jones somewhere\u2014in the gallery, I think\u2014somewhere on the left\u2014\nshe wants to know what became of the stone from her fancy ring\u2014she won't\nget it back\u2014it fell in the cinders when she was over the grate\u2014I can't\ntrace it further to-night.\" As soon as the name of Kate Jones was announced\nthat personage was instructed to hold up her paper, an assistant would go\nand take it from her, bring it to the Professor who had taken his stand at\nthe foot of the steps leading up to the stage, and he would unfold it and\nread out the question immediately Mrs. Baldwin's answer was given. The\nquestion in this instance was probably, \" Where shall I find the stone miss\ning from my ring ? Kate Jones.\" The questions were all of this type more or\n\f226 Frederic W. H Myers.\nless, and Mrs. Baldwin's answers were generally a mixture of skilful general\nities and bold dramatic detail, but never contained matter which could be\neither denied or confirmed on the spot. The real cleverness of the business\nhowever lay in the extra \"visions,\" so to speak, which often clustered round\nthe bare question. For instance, Mrs. Baldwin would say, \"There's a lady\nsitting here\u2014somewhere just beneath me\u2014whose mind is fixed upon some\nthing like\u2014like\u2014oh ! a cat. Why, yes\u2014that cat's been lost\u2014it's lost now,\ntoo ! \" The assistant meanwhile approached the lady (who was beamingly\nholding her paper up), spoke a few words to her, took her folded paper,\ncarried it to the Professor, who opened and read it, saying, \" Yes, Mrs. Bald\nwin is certainly on the right track\u2014now we'll just see if we can't catch\nthis cat.\" Then turning to Mrs. Baldwin, \"How long has it been lost ?\nCan you tell us 1 \" Mrs. Baldwin would make an effort and finally say, \"It\nhas been away from home some years\u2014one\u2014two- why, it must be nearly four\nyears.\" \"Is that so, madam?\" the Professor would enquire. \"Quite\ntrue,\" from the delighted lady. Then the Professor would read aloud from\nher paper, \" What became of my favourite Persian cat ? \" and he would draw\nattention to the fact that no hint was given in it as to the date of the\nanimal's disappearance. He would then proceed, \" Mrs. Baldwin seems to\nbe right on this cat's trail\u2014we'll chase it home any way.\" Then, turning to\nher, \"Can you tell us what that pussy's name was now?\" Here he would\nhasten on the stage, go behind her and make some violent passes towards the\nback of her head, the pianist meanwhile striking a loud and sustained\nchord. Mrs. Baldwin would start, strain, and declare with a gasping effort\nthat the cat's name was \"Dick.\" The lady having been called upon to\nconfirm this, Mrs. Baldwin would add some details to the effect that two\nmen (described) had been instrumental in getting the cat away, they sold it for\na good bit\u2014it seemed next in a dealer's shop\u2014and seemed now to be in a\ngood home\u2014in the country\u2014seemed well cared for. This case was one\nwhich actually came under my own notice. I watched every phase of it,\nand it affords a type of and a key to the whole performance. The date of\nthe cat's disappearance and its name were both communicated to the assis\ntant in answer to his enquiries when he collected the lady's paper, and he in\nturn communicated them to Baldwin in a passing whisper, whereupon Bald\nwin mounted the stage and whispered the word \"Dick\" to Mrs. Baldwin\nunder cover of the piano, but still quite loud enough for my companions\nand me to hear. Sometimes the Professor would communicate with Mrs. B.\nby means of a code, but I never saw this used except when dates were to be\ncommunicated, when it seemed to be invariably used.\nI saw the exhibition three times from a position in the stalls close to\nBaldwin. Again and again I saw assistants bring him the folded papers and\nat the same time rapidly mutter some information extracted from the\nenquirer ; and I got to know two or three of the words used in the number\ncode between Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin.\nIn the case of some questions such as, \" When shall I be married ? \" \"Shall\nI pass my examination ? \" and so on, the answer was easy enough to frame\nwithout the intermediate assistance of the \"Professor.\" Mrs. Baldwin's\nreplies often admitted of no proof\u2014nor could they be disproved ; but they\nexcited wonder all the same, for the simple reason that an appropriate\n\fResolute Credulity. 227\nanswer to an unseen question was a marvel in itself. The ground-work of\nthe whole thing was the well-known pad trick.\nAmongst the numerous mill-boards distributed to the audience were a\ngood many innocent-looking thin pads, and these probably contained a\nsheet of carbon paper concealed, so that anything written would leave an\nimpression beneath. These pads were distributed judiciously by the assis\ntants, who stood by ready to take them again at once, after use. I never\nreceived one of these, nor did any of my friends. I never received answer*, to\nany of my questions written upon the plain mill-boards, nor did any of my\nfriends. On the other hand, when one of the audience within my range of\nobservation received something to write upon which was obviously not a mill\nboard like mine, that person received an answer to his question. The assis\ntants no doubt kept these prepared pads separate from the others, and when\nthe mill-boards were subsequently placed by the footlights for everybody\nto see, the special ones would find their way behind the scenes, so that Mrs.\nBaldwin might inspect them and commit to memory suitable answers.\nI know a conjurer who is doing a \" Somnomancy \" entertainment (in\nimitation of the Baldwins) with great success by means of this pad trick ;\nbutthe thing which makes the Baldwin exhibition so specially remarkable\nis the skilful way in which they generally manage to give more information\nthan the written question conveys, and this, as I have explained, is managed\nby boldly pumping the writer on the quiet, and then retailing for the edifica\ntion and mystification of the entire audience the information thus gained.\nNut the least remarkable feature about the business is the fact that in\nnearly every case of such pumping, the person pumped is as much surprised\nas the rest of the audience when Mrs. Baldwin states the facta. This is,\nno doubt, due to the fact that the assistant is not looked upon as part of\nthe trick. It did not seem to occur to people that if they told the\nassistant, who politely came to receive their folded paper, that the lost watch\nwas marked with the initials \"J.W.\" he could tell the \"Professor,\" and\nthe \" Professor \" could tell Mrs. Baldwin. A friend of mine, a reporter,\nwho got hold of several of the people who had received most astonishing\nanswers, was much struck at finding that they had not only given to the\nassistant all the information additional to that contained in the written\nquestion, but that until closely questioned they had quite forgotten having\ndone so, through attaching no importance to it at the time.\nIt was often asserted in controversy that Mrs. Baldwin frequently\nanswered questions which had been privately written at home and which\nwere never produced from the writer's pocket until the answer was\nannounced at the public entertainment. Now Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin made a\nlarge circle of acquaintances in the town, and in fact held little impromptu\nreceptions daily. I think that some of these \" questions written at home \" were\nprobably the outcome of these receptions, where preliminary confidences,\npromptings, and pumpings doubtless occurred. Only on three occasions did\nI see answers given to questions which had been written on private paper\nbefore the entertainment. One was in the case of a lady, who had written\nher question on her own note-paper at home, and she received an answer\n\u2014appropriate enough, but not open to verification for some years to come.\nThis lady had certainly attended Mrs. Baldwin's tea-parties, and like her\n\f228 Frederic W. H. Myers.\nhusband (a press man), was one of her warmest admirers. It is quite pro\nbable that Mrs. Baldwin knew enough of this lady's interests to guess\nat the nature of the question ; in fact, it is not inconceivable that the\nquestion had been privately propounded, and that Mrs. Baldwin had said :\n\" You had better write it in the usual way, as I can answer better when in\nthe trance this evening.\" The second case was that of a boy who wanted\nto know whether he would become a chemist, his question being written,\non an old telegraph form. This may have been introduced by the mother\nin Mrs. Baldwin's presence in the same manner as in the last case ; or\nthe boy may have taken one of the assistants into his confidence\u2014for there\nwere hundreds of people who took Mrs. Baldwin quite seriously and made\nevery effort to get her advice upon subjects which they had close at heart.\nThe third case was that of a well-known Brighton clubman, who, sitting in\nthe front row obtained an answer to a question which he had pencilled\non his cuff. There could certainly be no confederacy here, but I do not\nthink it was by any means impossible for Baldwin himself or some of\nthe assistants to get a sight of this question during the excitement and\nwild confusion which always prevailed throughout this portion of the enter\ntainment. He was probably seen writing it. There were always plenty of\npeople at each entertainment carrying questions which had been previously\nwritten, who received no replies ; I know, myself, of a good many such\ncases amongst my own friends.\nThe whole business was most cleverly and successfully carried out\nhere ; but careful observers agreed that there was no good proof of\noccult or psychic power, whilst, on the other hand, the proofs of conjuring\nand trickery were abundant. GAS\nI give next an account of my own of a recent sitting with Mr. Husk.\nThe record, taken from notes jotted down shortly after the sitting, has\nbeen approved by \"Mrs. C,\" who, as the holder of Mr. Husk's other\nhand, was alone able to judge of its accuracy. It was also shown in\ndraft to two leading members of the group, who found nothing to con\ntradict ; although one of them, I fancy, retains some kind of belief Ln\nsome of Mr. Husk's phenomena. I should add that all the members of\nthis group, who had been sitting for a long time with Mr. Husk, were\npersons of position and intelligence ; and that \" Mr. A.\" particularly is\nan acute man of the world, and is himself the dread of impostors in a\nquite different line of research which he has made especially his own.\nI was recently told by a friend\u2014whom I will call Mr. A.\u2014that he had\nhad certain experiences with Mr. Husk,\u2014notably the playing of fairy belis.\nin the air,\u2014 which he was at a loss to explain. I reminded my friend of the\nexposure narrated in Light for February 14th, 1891, under the heading \"A\ntriple exposure of cheating mediums, Williams, Husk, Rita ; \" where the\nsudden flash of an electric pin disclosed Husk leaning over the table and\nshowing his own face as that of a spirit, illuminated by a card covered with\nluminous paint. I reminded him also of an incident recounted in S.P.R.\nProceedings, Vol. III., p. 460, where a committee, including Mr. Crookee,\nexamined an iron ring which encircled Husk's arm, and was believed by his.\n\fResolute Credulity.\nadmirers to be too small to have been placed in that position by ordinary\nmeans. The committee found that it was just not too small ;\u2014and offered to\ntake it off again by ordinary means ;\u2014guaranteeing the wearer against any\npain in the process by a few whiffs of chloroform. The offer was declined,\nbut the ring did not much longer figure as a standing miracle.\nMy friend replied that he held no brief for Husk's character, and that a\nmedium might be both fraudulent and genuine ; and since I agreed to this,\nand had a real curiosity as to the powers which enabled Husk to maintain a\nclientele in spite of the \" record \" above referred to, I consented to meet him\nat the lodgings of Mr. B. in Eaton Terrace, S.W., only stipulating that\nhis hands were to be held by myself and Mrs. C, a lady whose powers of\nobservation I had reason to trust. This was agreed to, and a group of seven\npersons awaited Mr. and Mrs. Husk in Mr. B.'s sitting-room. We were\nto sit at a round table, and Mr. B. pointed out that if one sat just opposite\na leg, one could step on to the table without shaking it. From any other\npoint one would tilt up the table in a dangerous way.\nMr. and Mrs. Husk arrived, and Mr. Husk, left to choose his seat, sat\ndown just opposite the leg of the table. \" Fairy bells \" and various small\nobjects were then placed on the table, which they nearly covered, so that\nthey lay a few inches from each sitter's hands. The room was then very\ncompletely darkened, and Husk offered his little fingers to Mrs. C. and\nmyself, in which to crook our own,\u2014that method of hand-holding being\nenjoined as least irksome. We linked hands all round in the same fashion.\nOf course the only security which we thus gained was that Husk would not\nactually walk away from us. His large hands were practically at liberty ;\nand as he moved our hands freely about, as though with convulsive tremore,\nour hold was not only no real check, but might even, as will be seen later,\nbecome a positive advantage to him. He kept his arms well out from his\nsides, and his body and legs at such a distance from us that without\ndeliberate effort, of a kind unlikely to be made by his ordinary sitters, no\ncontact was possible.\nThe first \"phenomenon\" was a general shaking of the room, which\nceased and began again at request, so as to show that it was not due to any\nexternal cause. The value of such a phenomenon depends, of course, on\nthe ease with which any particular room can be shaken, and we found by\nsubsequent experiment that it is perfectly easy to shake Mr. B.'s room\n(which is in a very ill-built house), by vigorous contractions of the muscles\nof the thighs upon the chair. Of course, one can hardly keep one's hands\nquite still meanwhile, but Husk's hands jerked about in such a way as to\nconceal any tremor which might have been caused by muscular pushes on the\nseat of his chair.\nSpirit-voices then came;\u2014that is to say, Husk leant first in one direction\nand then in another, and uttered quasi-pleasantries for which I am glad not\nto be obliged to hold any disembodied intelligence responsible. On one\noccasion, for instance, I leant forward rather markedly over my hands on thoi\ntable, and Husk, who is a tall man and can move noiselessly, leant over and\nbehind me, and made some remark in a squeaky voice over my further\nshoulder. It was so absolutely obvious how this was done that when \" Uncle,\"\nor whatever the supposed spirit's name was, said, (from Husk's normal\n\f230 Frederic W. H. Myers.\nposition, which he briskly regained,) \" There ! I jumped over your shoulder\nthat time ! \" it was hard to realise that a claim was made that the voice\nhad been separate from the medium's body. Some of the party, I learnt,\nhad taken a ventriloquist to decide whether these voices were due to\nventriloquilism or to spirits. He pronounced that neither hypothesis was\nrequired. For the most part Husk leant well back behind Mrs. C. to\nutter these voices, assuming, (although, as it happened, erroneously,) that\nthe lady was the less formidable of his two neighbours. He gave another\nindication of this presently when more serious business began. Husk now\nmoved his hands more violently, raised ours from the table, and swung them\nabout in the air. Mrs. C, who held his right hand, extended her fingers to\ndiscover what it was that he wished to touch. She found her hand brought\ninto contact with the back of his chair, so that his linked hand might have\nhitched it into a position convenient for his next move. I managed to sidle a\nlittle nearer to him on my side, and distinctly felt the movement of his thigh\nand knee, aa he stepped on to his chair and then on to the table, with a corres\nponding strain on my little finger, which he now held high in air, and used to\nsteady himself in stepping upwards. This was so manifest that I immediately\nsaid \"Mr. Husk has stepped on to the table,\" to which Mrs. Husk replied,\n\" He has not stepped on to the table ; \"\u2014being, I suppose, aware in some\noccult manner that he had been raised in some occult way. I then felt about\nfor Husk's chair, but that also had been lifted on to the table, probably by\nhis placing one foot through its back and hitching it up after him, when he\nhad placed one foot firmly on the table. We tried this afterwards, and Mr.\nB. found that with a little practice it was not difficult, given the two hands\non each side by which to steady oneself in the process. The table was\nlow, and the chairs light. It is possible, however, that he drew up the\nchair with his right hand, keeping it immediately beneath him, and away\nfrom Mrs. C.1\nAfter a minute or two we were told to light up, and saw Husk, still\nholding our little fingers, sitting on the back of his chair, with his feet on\nits seat, in the middle of the table,\u2014a performance which was rendered quite\neasy by the continued support of our hands.\nHe then descended, and the room was re-darkened. An attempt was\nmade by the spirits to get Mrs. Husk to sit next to the medium, but this we\ndeclined, and Mrs. C. and I changed places, (Mrs. C. now taking Husk's\nleft hand with her right), so as to use fresh little-fingers, as the strain which\nHusk had imposed on those members had made them almost insensible ;\u2014a\nresult, by the way, which may have its value at times. We sat for a few\nminutes, and the small objects on the table in front of Mr. Husk began to\nmove about. But almost at once the squeaky voice was heard, saying to\nMrs. C, \"You're breaking the conditions !\" \"No,\" replied Mrs. C. with\ntruth, \" I still hold my neighbour's finger, as I was told, to maintain the\nchain.\" What Mrs. C. had in fact done was to bring her neighbour's hand\nand her own left hand well on to the table, and near the objects, so that\nwhen Husk put out his left-hand fingers to move the objects, he came in\ncontact with Mrs. C.'s left hand as well. There were no more move-\n1 For a somewhat similar feat on the part of Mr. Eglinton, see Proeeedinai,\nVol. IX., p. 359.\n\fResolute Credulity.\nments, except the movement of thirty-live shillings into Mr. Husk's pocket\nbefore he aud his wife went away. I cannot but think that there is still a\nvery fair opening for beginners in this trade.\nThe playing of the fairy bells did not occur,\u2014but it seems only to occur\nwhen Mrs. Husk, or some similarly devoted person, sits next to Husk. Two\nhands being then free, Husk can easily stand on his chair and play (say)\nwith his right hand the instrument held up by Mrs. Husk with her left,\nTarring this by himself holding up the instrument and knocking it against\ntheceiling; a phenomenon observed, as I understand, only in low rooms. As\nthe whereabouts of the instrument is recognised by a piece of luminous\ncardboard gummed on to it, it would, of course, be easy to enlarge its\napparent range of flight by brandishing a similar piece of luminous card\nboard at the end of a wire. But I must not demoralise Mr. Husk by\nsuggesting tricks of this kind. His actual powers are amply sufficient for all\nthat his sitters call upon him to perform.\u2014F.W.H.M.\nMrs. Sidgwick, to whom I showed this account, produced for me\nanother record (undated) of a sitting with Husk, by the late Mr. S.\nJ. Davey ; interesting to me as showing in actual operation the little\nartifice with luminous paper and musical box above suggested. Our\nreaders will remember that Mr. Davey's own skill in reproducing and\nsurpassing various \"spiritualistic phenomena\" by adroit conjuring led\nmany spiritualists to believe for a long time, in spite of Mr. Davey'a\ndisclaimers, that he was a powerful medium himself. See Proceedingt\nS.P.R., VoL VIII., p. 253.\nA few months ago my friend Munro and myself went to a seance given\nby Messrs. Husk and Williams at 15, Southampton Row, for the benefit of\na certain Mr. Robson.\nThe room where the sitting was held being somewhat small, it was\ndecided the chairs should be placed as per diagram herewith.\nMantel-shelf\nWilliams \"~\" - -\n( ( ) )\nTable\n\u00b0) )\nr (\u00b0 ) \u00ab)\n-\nA Husk\nV\nPiano\n1\nWindow\nHands were supposed to be held all round.\n\f232 Frederic W. H. Myers.\nOn taking our seats Munro selected that marked A, whilst I sat next to\nhim at B.\nThe lights being turned out the spirits rapped out that they objected\nto Munro sitting at A, consequently he had to move over to C and I slipped,\ninto his former seat at A.\nWhilst the others were loudly singing \" Shall we gather at the river,\" I\nput my head down close to the table, and in doing so I heard Husk say\nsomething in an undertone across the table to Williams.\nImmediately after this the raps proceeded from the neighbourhood of\nWilliams and reflected upon my adverse magnetism, and as the gentleman\nnext to me at G remarked that he felt very sick, I thought it prudent to\nchange my quarters and therefore went over to H.\nI then found I had made a good exchange, for I noticed coming through\nthe door at L, a faint streak of light, and this I should never have seen had\nI retained my seat at B.\nThe usual mountebank tricks were then played, such as the medium's\nspeaking through the paper trumpets, etc.\nAided by the streak of light I distinctly observed a form, which I have\nlittle doubt was Husk, stalking about the room. Every time he crossed the\nstreak he was plainly visible, and every now and then he patted the sitters'\nheads with the paper tube he carried in his hands. (N.B.\u2014There was no\nsuggestion of a spirit moving about the room.)\nMr. Burns sat at F and it seems incredible he could not have seen this\nas well as myself, for the figure was sometimes only a foot or two distant.\nA large musical box commenced to play and was supposed to float over\nthe heads of the sitters. I discovered that the floating light supposed to be\nthe musical box was simply a small piece of luminous substance and that the\nmusical box was on the table most of the time. I should say that un\ndoubtedly either Mr. Husk or Mr. Williams employed the well known\nfishing-rod apparatus to float the luminous substance about the room. I saw\nwhat appeared to be a black cloud over the table in the neighbourhood of\nthe musical box, and it is possible that this was the stuff used to vary the\nsounds by muffling the box. I also think that on one or two occasions the\nmusical box was really lifted off the table, a feat easily to be accomplished\nby any one with the free use of their two hands.\nVarious \"phenomena \" tdok place, but none worthy of record. In fact,\nmost of the tricks were so badly worked that they were unworthy of the\nname of conjuring.\nS. J. Davey.\nA good many unpublished M.S.S. of this type are by this time in\nthe possession of the S.P.R.; and there are (for instance) further\npapers with regard to Messrs. Husk and Rita, which can be produced\nshould those gentlemen desire it.\nFor my part, although I had set aside some further detections to\nquote, I am now weary of this uncongenial task. And I trust that in\nLondon at any rate there is not now nearly so much of this kind of\nthing going on as there was when the efforts of theS.P.R. began. Most\nof the Harpies have fled from Phineus' banquet-hall ; have estab\n\fResolute Credulity. 233\nlished elsewhere their dark rooms and their seance-tables\u2014 mmtatque\nmelu Hqttere priorea.\nOne final word,\u2014addressed both to those who look askance on our\nlabours, and to those who fain would assist them. The case of our\npsychological work, as compared with psychological work recognised as\northodox, stands, if I mistake not, somewhat thus. Psychology is at last\nbecoming an experimental science ;\u2014is even aspiring to become the\nchief of sciences. At present, however, two groups work, with little\nconnection, at the two ends of Experimental Psychology. First come\nthe many new Professors and Lecturers in Germany, France, America,\nand elsewhere who are making accurate experiments on everything in\nman which they can manage to get at ;\u2014the nervous system in general,\nvision, audition, orientation, tactile sensibility, reaction-times, fatigue,\nattention, memory, mental imagery,\u2014with a host of cognate inquiries.\nMuch of this is delicate quantitative work, and is performed with\ninstruments of precision. The drawback is that such methods and such\napparatus are better adapted to give accuracy to facts already roughly\nknown than to carry the inquirer much farther into the depths of our\nbeing. It is work preparatory to discovery, rather than discovery\nitself.\nAt the other end of the range a group still small, although it\nspreads yearly somewhat wider in each civilised land, is attacking\npsychological problems of the highest importance, but which admit as\nyet of only approximate and tentative methods of inquiry. This is\nwork of discovery indeed ; but it is rough pioneer's work\u2014preparatory\nalso in its own way to the ultimate science to which we all aspire. And\nfor a new and complex task like this you must needs prepare In both\nthese ways. If men want to make a map of India they may begin by\naccurate measurements of a small tract of populous plain ;\u2014but at the\nsame time by attempting a first and half-conjectural survey of the un\nsealed Himalayas. If you choose the former task as your own you can\nprogress without mistakes ; if the second, you needs must make many\nmistakes, since no man who dares not be often baffled can reach the\nsecret of the snows.\nIt is our duty then to remember that we are no isolated hunters,\ntut the scouts and avant-couriers of the scientific host. Our work, to\nbe of permanent value, must lie in the preparation of data for\norganised science. However bizarre our facts may be, we must treat\nthem with as distinct a sense of responsibility to the ultimate judgment\nof the learned world as though they were merely fresh facts of an old\ntype; as though, for instance, we were computing from scanty observa\ntions the path of a new comet.\nI disclaim altogether that spirit of exclusiveness which has some\ntimes\u2014almost grotesquely as it seems to me\u2014been alleged against the\n\f234 Frederic W. H. Myers.\ngroup with which I work. I believe that in no way has our standard\nbeen held too high ; and though we may thus have missed many\nadherents, I believe that we have not lost one collaborator whose work\nwould have been of serious value. We need, of course, informants and\nhelpers in every country and in every position in life. 'We welcome\nand respect every informant, be he Spiritualist or Agnostic, or an un\nlettered rustic or a child of ten, who comes to us in that straightforward\ntemper which is as natural to child as to savant, because it is the temper\nnot of Science only, but of Conscience herself. On the other hand tht\nhinderers of our cause\u2014the \" back-friends,\" as the old English term\nwould exactly name them\u2014are merely such men as sciences of older\nstatus than ours have long been able to rule out of court. Our foes\nare the crank and the charlatan ; the intellectual parasite who exists\nat second-hand ; the fanatic who ignores damning evidence and takes\nfraud for marvel ; the self-seeker who would reserve from the common\nfund of truth a peculinm or perquisite of his own.\nBut I would not speak as though men like these were growing in\nnumber. On the contrary, it says much that we should even have\nbegun to dream of expelling them from a region so long the chosen\nsanctuary of outlaws from the scientific camp. And the dominant\nfeeling, I venture to say, of all those who have taken an active part in\nthis movement is one of surprise and gratitude at the amount of\ngenerous and competent help which we have received from men and\nwomen previously unknown to us ;\u2014at the rapid extension of those\nhabits of thought and action which our research requires. For my own\npart, such share as I have taken in the work would have been manifestly\nimpossible without the help literally of hundreds of careful, intelligent,\ndisinterested correspondents. Such contributions, indeed, have formed\nso integral a part of all that I have published that I have rarely been\nable to speak of the contributors as I would, lest I should seem to\nbespeak favour for myself also. Personal matters, however, are of\nlittle moment in a quest like ours. Res enim humani generis agitur,\nnon nostra ; and it is not for the sake of one group, or of one age, that\nwe may desire that the helpers of our work shall be many, and the\nhinderers few.\n\fTelepathic Dream* Experimentally Induced. 235\nIV.\nTELEPATHIC DREAMS EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED.\nBy Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\n[Dr. Ermacora, of Padua, is already known to readers of these\nProceedings by an experiment numbered M. 41 and printed in the\nProceedings, Vol. IX., p. 68. Since the publication of that case Dr.\nErmacora, in conjunction with Dr. Finzi of Milan, has become the\nEditor of the Rivista di Studi rsichici.\u2014Ed.]\nIntroduction.\nDuring part of the months of September and October, 1892, I had\nleft Padua and was at Milan, in order to be present at some experi\nments which were being made there with the aid of the well-known\nmedium, Eusapia Paladino. I was obliged in consequence to interrupt\nthe psychical experiments which I had for some time been making in\nPadua with Signa Maria Manzini, who possesses automatic powers of\nvarious kinds, both motor and sensory, with occasional indications of\nsupernormal faculty, shown especially in her susceptibility to telepathy\nand, more doubtfully, in her apparent power of foreseeing the future\nand of producing physical phenomena. Her motor automatism takes\nthe form of writing in the waking state ; and the form of speech\nand mimicry with changes of personality in special conditions of\nsomnambulism ; her sensory automatism consists in auditory hallucina\ntions of articulate and occasionally of musical sounds, and visual\nhallucinations, fully developed only during somnambulism. All these\nphenomena, whether motor or sensory, are not the result of suggestion,\nin the common acceptation of the word, but are connected with the\nassumption of the existence of certain mediumistic personalities, which\nassert, without however having been able as yet to adduce sufficiently\nconvincing proofs of it, that they are the disembodied spirits of human\nbeings.\nShortly after my departure for Milan, there came to live with\nSigna Maria her little cousin Angelina Cavazzoni, of Venice. Angelina\nwas born on July 16th, 1888. Thus, during the experiments here\nrecounted, and in which this child played so important a part, her age\nvaried from 4 years and 3 months to 4 years and 10 months.\nAlthough the experiments which I shall describe have not yet\nreached the point I could have wished to attain before publishing\n\f236 Dr. J. B. Ermacora.\nthem, still I think them worthy of note, both because I have not yet\nseen a systematic series of researches in this direction published, and\nbecause I believe that some of the results already obtained are of\nsufficient importance to arrest the attention of modern psychical\nresearchers, and to encourage them to further investigations in this\ndirection.\nOrigin of the Experiments.\nWhile I was at Milan, I received from Signa Maria a letter dated\nSeptember 23rd, of which I give a part. I ought first, however, to\nmention that the name JMvira refers to a mediumistic personality\nwhich habitually manifests itself through the automatism of Signa Maria.\nIt has the characteristics of a child, and professes the greatest affection\nfor Signa Maria. Here is a part of the letter :\u2014\n. . . . Yesterday Angelina arrived and slept with me. Last night I\nwas sleepless and crying The child was, I am sure, wide awake.\nand all at once I saw her put out her hands as if to catch something. I said to\nher, \" Be quiet and go to sleep.\" Then she said, \" Do you not see, Aunt\/'\n.(Angelina calls Signa Maria aunt, although really she is her cousin, but not of\nthe same generation) \" that beautiful child?\" I looked at the pictures in\nthe room,1 for at that particular moment I was not thinking of spirits. And\nshe added, \" Are you deaf ; don't you hear her speaking 1 And she says t\"\nme that you should not weep, hut that you should sleep.\" Then I bethought\nmyself of the little Elvira, and I asked Angelina, \" How is she dressed 1 \"\nShe replied, \" She has a beautiful blue pinafore, Aunt ; make one like it for\nme to-morrow.\" Then nothing more passed. But this morning, the first\nthing for which she asked me, before I had spoken to her, was the pinafore\nlike that of the little girl. It may be nothing, but to-day I shall try to make\nher write (automatically),2 and shall watch whether she hears herself\nspoken to.\nThis incident was quite sufficient to lead one to suppose a probable\nsusceptibility in Angelina to telepathic perception, for the blue\ngarment and the eagerness to comfort Signa Maria in her sad moments\nwere precisely the characteristics of the mediumistic personality Elvira,\nwhom Signa Maria saw in dreams and in somnambulism, and with\nwhom she communicated in automatic writing. Moreover, Angelina,\nwho had only arrived that day, had no knowledge of the experiments\nof Signa Maria, nor did she ever hear of them later on. Sign\" Maria is\nnot in the habit of speaking of them to others, and has never men\ntioned them even to her mother, her sole companion, with whom she\nlives in perfect harmony.\n1 Signorina Maria explained to me afterwards, that at first she thought that\nAngelina alluded to one of the pictures of women in the room. The light was\nburning.\n5 Angelina showed no particular aptitude either for automatic writing or for\nhallucinatory audition.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 237\nThe following extract is from another letter of Signa Maria's, dated\nSeptember 26th :\u2014\nOn Saturday night (Sept. 24th) I dreamt that Elvira brought Adrian*1\nto me as usual. Angelina says she saw her in the night, but she cannot\nexplain herself as well as the first time ; she says that she also sees her\nown mother, and she asks incessantly for an apron like that of the\nchild,1 so much so that I was obliged to make her one with some stuff I\nhad ; but she does not care for it, because, she aays, it is not \" like the\nother. \"\nIt will be understood that Adriatic is a personality of the same kind\nas Elvira. He showed at this period a childish character, and Elvira\ncalls him her brother.\nThe visual hallucination of her own mother was not new to Angelina,\nfor a similar thing had happened to her at the end of July of the same\nyear, 1892, when, shortly after the death of her mother, she had come\nto spend some days at Padua with Signa Maria. But in this case it is\nuncertain whether it was a hallucination or simply a dream, for\nAngelina only spoke of it in the morning.\nIn a letter dated September 28th, Signa Maria wrote to me as\nfollows :\u2014\nThe little Elvira comes seldom. Angelina said yesterday morning that\nshe had seen her (in a dream), and she drives me mad because she wants to\ngo with the child ; she says she cannot go because she has not got a pinafore\nlike hers.\nIn another letter dated October 2nd, Sig,la Maria tells me that on\nSeptember 24th, when she was receiving communications from Elvira\nby means of automatic writing, she asked her, \" Was it really you who\nshowed yourself to Angelina?\" To which Elvira replied, \" Yes, it was\nI, because I like the child.\"\nAlthough frequently communications of this kind are rather irrele\nvant and characterised by the incoherence of ordinary dreams, yet in\nthis instance, the personality Elvira having already shown a certain\ncoherence, and, moreover, some signs of supernormal activity,2 I felt\njustified in hoping that on my return to Padua I should perhaps be\nable to evoke, with the co-operation of the child and of Elvira, pheno\nmena of the nature already described, but more distinct, and under\nmore conclusive conditions.\n1 Angelina never knew even afterwards that this child seen by her in sleep, or in\nhypnagogic hallucinations, was already known to us, and bore the name of Elvira,\nand she always alluded to her as the \"blue child.\" This proves that Angelina had\nnot been in the least degree influenced by anything she had heard.\n! I speak purposely in vague terms, and shall continue to do so, so as to leave\nunprejudiced the question,\u2014in my opinion yet unsolved,\u2014whether Elvira and the other\nanalogous personalities which manifest themselves by means of Signorina Maria are\ncreations of her subliminal consciousness, or possess independent individualities.\nU\n\f238 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\nPart I.\nPreliminary Experiments.\nOn October 18th, 1892, I returned to Padua, and on the same\nevening I recommenced experimenting with Sig\"\" Maria with auto\nmatic writing.\nThe personality Elvira manifested itself and at once asked after\nAngelina, and, without being questioned, told us that with her help\nand that of Adriano she hoped to be able to show us something fi-ne\nsoon. She said, however, that we must not ask her for explanations\nnow, because \" Adriano, who will be the principal author of all,\ndoes not wish to give us other explanations,\" and she \" fears to\nspoil everything by disobeying him.\" Afterwards, however\u2014so far,\nat least, as I could judge\u2014the personality Adriano did not seem\nto be concerned in any interesting fact connected with the little\nAngelina.\nBut before proceeding further, I wish to justify what might be\ncondemned by some as an error in the system of exposition which I\nhave adopted.\nThe idea still exists amongst many people that in psychical phe\nnomena there are only two things worthy of note\u2014( 1 ) the definite result\nof the phenomenon expressed in terms which do not involve ideas as to\nthe nature of the process, and (2) the subject considered from a physio\nlogical or pathological point of view. This mode of procedure\nresembles that of a person who, wishing to study a clock, considers\nonly the movement of the hands and the outside case, leaving out the\nmechanism on which that movement depends. Now, the motor\nmechanism of every psychical phenomenon is naturally the personality\nwhich produces it, and therefore this should be studied with the\ngreatest care,\u2014as well as the subject,\u2014not only in the case (supposing\nit to be possible) when the acting personality is extraneous to the\nsubject, but also when it is merely a psychical isomer of the normal\npersonality of the subject himself; for in both cases,\u2014as we are treating\nof conscious and volitional acts,\u2014if we neglect to study the personality\nwhich knowingly and willingly acts, we neglect the study of the true\nmechanism of the phenomenon.\nMany experimenters, while maintaining a correspondence with\nthese acting personalities, feel some repugnance to mentioning their\nrelations to them, or do not do so frankly, except when they are of the\nofficially recognised type of somnambulic personalities. This seems to\nme an unwarrantable suppression of facts ; accordingly, I feel bound\nto follow quite an opposite method, although it may be distasteful to\nsome readers.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 239\nNaturally I shall condense the communications somewhat, modify\ning them where the style or personal considerations may make it\nnecessary, without of course altering the sense so far as the present\nargument is concerned.\nTo return to the experiments.\nExperiment 1.\u2014On the evening of October 19th, I put myself as\nusual in communication with Elvira. Sign* Maria and I were alone\nwith Angelina, who appeared to be sleeping profoundly. As I was\nthinking more of the vague promise of experiments with Angelina\nwhich Elvira had made the evening before than of my own plans, I\nfirst asked Elvira whether she would be able to try something with the\nchild this evening, and whether we ought to wake her. She replied (in\nautomatic writing) that Adriano was again absent and therefore she\ncould do nothing, and that when she was coming with him, she would\nwarn us. But, as I have already remarked, nothing interesting ever\noccurred to Angelina with the apparent assistance of Adriano.\nThen I asked Elvira if she could appear to Angelina, as she said\nshe had done on the night of September 22nd to 23rd. She replied :\u2014\n\" Certainly I can, but the child must be sleeping, and if I can I\nwill appear to her in a dream. You must ask her afterwards what she\nhas seen, and so discover whether I have succeeded.\"\nQuestion. \" But why do you doubt your power to make her see you\nin a dream, if you have already been able to show yourself to her when\nawake ? \"\nAiuwer. \" Yes, that is a reasonable question ; but you must know\nthat on that evening, seeing Maria very unhappy, I made a great effort,\nwhich can only be made for a person extraordinarily dear, and so I\nsucceeded. However, I will try this evening in a dream ; moreover the\nchild will see me, when she is awake, when I come with Adriano.\"\nQ. \" How must we try 1 Will you show yourself to Angelina after\nMaria has been sent to sleep, or before ? \"\nA. \"I warn you first that this is not a proper evening to send Maria\nto sleep. I will appear to Angelina in the form of a child with a beauti\nful doll in my arms, and if I can I will come in another colour \" (i.e.,\nnot dressed in her favourite blue).\nQ. \" Then we are to experiment at once ? \"\nA. \" Yes ; I wish to try at once, but mind you ask the child what\nshe has seen. I may very likely be dressed in pink, and if I succeed I\nshall be content. I warn you that I shall not communicate again this\nevening, and so I wish you good evening, but remember that if I fail it\nis not my fault, not being accustomed to do this. If Adriano were\nhere he would certainly succeed.\"\nO 2\n\f240 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\nNaturally these communications were read in silence, and no word\nwas spoken about the doll and the pink dress, lest Angelina should be\ninfluenced, although asleep. Not knowing when the supposed action\nof Elvira would end, I thought it better to wait till the child had been\nquestioned the next morning.\nThe evening of the following day (October 20th) Signa Maria told\nme that by means of persistent, but not suggestive, questions she had\nbeen able to elicit from Angelina that she had dreamt of Elvira with\na doll in her arms, but she was dressed in blue and not in pink as had\nbeen settled. In order to make sure that the child was not making a\nmistake as to the name of the colour, Signa Maria showed her various\npatterns of coloured stuffs from which to choose the colour she meant,\nand she chose the blue.\nSo the dream was not in complete accordance with the programme,\nand, what is more important, the conditions under which it occurred\nwere not conclusive ; because the child slept with Signa Maria, and it\nis possible that the latter while asleep may have suggested the dream\nto Angelina verbally.\nIn the next communication from Elvira (by automatic writing,\nOctober 21st), she justified the partial failure in her own way, saying\nthat \"she had not had time to make another colour\" (i.e., different\nfrom the usual one). She did not seem disposed to repeat the experi\nment that evening.\nOn October 22nd Elvira (in automatic writing) told us that not\neven the next night would it be possible to act. Nevertheless, next\nday, Signa Maria told me that in the morning the child had told her\nspontaneously that she had again dreamt of Elvira with the doll in\nher arms, but that this time she had on a pink dress. Thus the dream\nproposed on October 19th was completely realised on the night of the\n21st-22nd ; but this seems not in harmony with the hypothesis that\nthe dreams were really called forth by the personality Elvira, since she\nhad said she could not act. Asked for an explanation, she gave it (in\nautomatic writing) in the following terms :\u2014\n\" Yesterday evening Angelina took her doll to bed, and therefore\ndreamt that she saw me, but I assure you it was not the case, but all\nthe effect of fancy. I have already told you many times when we\nreally originated the dreams, and I am sincere and tell you the truth\nwhen they are the effect of fancy. So I think there is no need for so\nmany doubts, because I am the first to warn you what dreams are true\nand what imaginary.\"\nAlthough the communication may only have been an excuse\ninvented on the spur of the moment, still I must note that on the\nevening of October 21st, when I asked Elvira why in the preceding\ndream she had not appeared to Angelina in the pink dress, Angelina\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 241\nwas present,1 and it is likely that on the night of the 22nd, at the\nmoment of falling asleep, the idea of the doll at hand may have been\nassociated with the idea of Elvira dressed in pink and with a doll in\nher arms, and may have produced the dream.\nIt will be seen that in the course of the experiments the explana\ntions given by Elvira proved trustworthy, at least as far as they\nconcerned things accessible to her intelligence and verifiable by ours.\nSeeing some probability of success, I wished at once to try the\nexperiments under better conditions, determining to exercise stricter\ncontrol by degrees as success followed on the less rigorous. So all I\ndid at first was to have Angelina put to sleep alone in a little room\nclose to that in which Sign* Maria and her mother slept. The two\nrooms communicate by the landing of the staircase on which their\ndoors open.\nExperiment 2.\u2014October 2ith. Evening.\u2014I found Sign* Maria in\nbed with a bad headache, an ailment to which she has been subject\nfrom infancy. I put her into the somnambulic state to cure it by\nsuggestion. I took this opportunity to evoke a communication from\nElvira, who manifested to Signa Maria through a sensory hallucination.*\nShe proposed to cause Angelina to dream of her dressed in pink,\nwith a white parasol in one hand, and a fan, also white, in the other,\nand with bare feet, according to her custom.\nAfter waking Signa Maria (whose somnambulism is always followed\nby amnesia), I forgot to warn her that Angelina would probably have\nsome dream in the night, and that she must question her in the\nmorning. Leaving Bigna Maria's room, I found her mother issuing from\nthe next room, where she had just put Angelina to bed ; the child had\nalready been asleep for some time on the ground-floor, so that she\ncould not have heard Sigm Maria's voice when she related to me the\ndream planned by Elvira.\nOctober 2oth.\u2014In the evening, when I went to Signa Maria's house,\nshe told me that Angelina kept saying to her all day that she wanted a\n1 This does not contradict what I said at first about the child's ignorance of the\nnature of these experiments, for at an age when a child does not know what writing\nia, it is unlikely to know what automatic writing is, and the little one could not\nsuspect the presence of any personality other than our normal selves from my\nbehaviour.\n! Neither during Signorina Maria's somnambulism nor in other conditions does\nmT suggestion alone suffice to evoke the personality Elvira. I do not exclude\nthe possibility of producing in the trance a hallucination of the presence of Elvira,\njust as I could produce the hallucinatory presence of a real person ; but probably in\nthis case the Elvira so suggested would not be coherent with the other. I deduce\nthis from the fact that Elvira often flatly denies strong convictions of Signorina\nMaria's with regard to her ; hence I infer that she would equally repudiate the falsa\nElvira suggested by me.\n\f242 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\nwhite parasol and a white fan. Signa Maria did not guess the origin of\nthe child's wish. The latter had not told her of the dream, nor did\nSigna Maria, who was not aware of the experiment, think of question\ning her. She assured me that after my departure on the evening before\nshe did not move from her own bed, nor in any way communicate with\nthe child during the night. Siga Annetta, who slept with her\ndaughter, confirmed this.\nThese conditions, however, were far from being conclusive, both\nbecause Angelina's desire for a white parasol and a white fan was not\nsufficient to prove that the dream predicted by Elvira took place, and\nbecause the possibility of verbal suggestion during the night on the\npart of Signa Maria, to whom Elvira might have returned in the trance\nstate, was not excluded. I say Elvira might have returned, because\nnot only does Elvira in motor manifestation1 leave no traces in\nthe somnambulic memory (much less in the normal memory) of\nSigna Maria ; but, as I discovered later, the period of somnambulism\nduring which Elvira manifests sensorially2 to Signa Maria, although it\ndiffers in no other point from her ordinary somnambulism, is followed\nby amnesia directly Elvira's sensorial manifestation ceases, although\nthe somnambulic state remains apparently unaltered.3 Consequently\nthe spontaneous appearance of the normal somnambulism does not\nsuffice to recall the ideas expressed by Elvira while manifesting sen\nsorially in a previous somnambulistic state of Signa Maria. Therefore\nif the somnambulism and the personality of Elvira happen to present\nthemselves when Signa Maria's mother is asleep, the former might\npossibly go to the child's room and act on her by verbal suggestion.\nAlthough during several years of hypnotic experiment I have only\nobserved two or three cases of spontaneous somnambulism in Signa\nMaria, it will be better to keep its possible occurrence in mind,\nbecause we continued our experiments in this way for some time before\nintroducing stricter conditions. On the other hand, there is no need to\nexaggerate this danger, or to make the gratuitous hypothesis that it\nwould be easy to produce a series of exact and complicated dreams, like\nthose I shall relate, by mere verbal suggestion, in a person who had never\nbeen hypnotised. In any case, when precautions were taken later on,\nthe dreams occurred in spite of them.\nExperiment 3.\u2014On the same evening (October 25th), wishing to\nadvance a step, I asked Elvira if it would be possible to make\nAngelina dream according to a programme pre-arranged. She replied\n1 That is, when Signorina Maria speaks as Elvira.\u2014El1.\n2 That is, through a sensory hallucination.\u2014En.\n* Sometimes the moment of the internal change is marked by a slight sigh or &\nyawn.\n\fTelepathic Urewms Experimentally Induced. 243\n(by automatic writing) that it could be done, or that at least she hoped\n50. I then proposed that Angelina should dream of Elvira with a light\nin one hand and a cross in the other.\nAnswer. \" The light if you like, but not the cross : choose some\nthing else.\"\nI proposed Signs Maria's portrait instead of the cross. Elvira\naccepted the idea of a portrait, but preferred that of Angelina's mother,\nrecently dead. Kind feeling on Elvira's part, no doubt, prompted this\nsuggestion as it had prompted the rejection of the cross. For when\nasked if she had rejected it on account of a religious scruple, she\nreplied, \" Not at all ; only it would have made too strong an impression\non the child.\"\nOctober 26<A.\u2014Signa Maria told me that she had not seen Angelina\nagain the evening before, after I had proposed the dream and departed.\nThe child was then in her room and asleep, and Signa Maria went at\nonce to bed in her mother's room.\nDirectly Angelina awoke in the morning, she came to Signa Maria's\nbed, and the latter, after waiting to see if the child would relate a\ndream, followed my instructions, and tried to draw her attention to a\nlight. No effect. She then talked to her of a box Angelina knows,\nwhich has the picture of a little girl on its lid. Upon which Angelina\nsaid she had seen the blue child in a dream, and added that this time\nshe had no parasol or fan, but a light in one hand, and a portrait\n(unrecognised) in the other, and was dressed in white. The non-\nrecognition of the portrait is interesting, for it begins to make us sec\nthat the perception probably takes place by means of sensorial images,\nand not by any process of direct ideation independent of these images.\nIt is a point of great importance in the present experiments, because it\nis the first indication that the child is directly impressed by the images\nof the things represented in the dream, and not by verbal suggestion.\nOctober 27th.\u2014Sig^ Maria told me that last night Angelina had\ndreamed of Elvira with a book and a candlestick in her hands. As no\ndream had been arranged the evening before, this counts as a failure.\nIt is instructive, however, as showing, as did that of October 22nd-23rd,\nthe child's tendency to spontaneous reproduction of dreams on the\nsame theme. I had no time to ask Elvira, as I did on the 23rd, if\nthis dream had been induced by her.\nExperiment 4.\u2014I wished to assure myself of the success of this simple\ntype of dreams, and proposed that this night Elvira should appear in a\ndream with a violin in one hand and a bottle in the other. When\nasked if she would find this easy, she replied (by automatic writing),\n\" Yes, it is very easy for me, but you must ask the child directly she\n.wakes, or she may forget and make a mistake.\"\n\f244 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nAsked if she required time for her action, or if she produced the\ndreams instantaneously, she answered :\u2014\n\" Oh, no, indeed ; I must have at least ten minutes.\"\nElvira appears to appreciate time with sufficient exactness.1\nOctober 28lh. Evening.\u2014Complete failure. The child had been\nindisposed, and had slept in Signa Maria's bed. She had not dreamed.\nI asked Elvira the reason of this. She replied, through motor som\nnambulism, that it had been impossible to act, on account of the child's\ndisturbed sleep. Signa Maria had been obliged to wake her often, thus\ninterrupting Elvira's action. Sign* Maria confirmed this when she\nwoke.\nExperiment 5.\u2014During the trance, and while Elvira was present,\nI asked her to make Angelina dream as follows : she was to be at\nVenice in a two-oared gondola with Signa Maria and me, and go to the\nLido. Elvira justly observed that the child on waking would not be\nable to explain the object of our excursion, and that, therefore, to make\nsure of the place she must be made to see the horses, the baths, and\nthe sea with its waves, Elvira making the sound \" vuuh \" to imitate\nthe noise of the waves.\nWhen Elvira was gone, I did not mention the proposed dream to\nSigna Maria either in her trance or in her normal state after waking,\nin order that she might remain ignorant of it in both conditions. It\nis needless to say that Angelina on the ground floor had heard nothing.\nWhen I left, some time after Signa Maria had woke, I saw Angelina\nalready in bed and asleep.\nOctober 29th.\u2014I found Signa Maria in bed and indisposed this\nevening. She told me she had gone to bed directly after I left, with\nout seeing the child ; said that Angelina had risen at seven a.m., and\ncome to her room about eight, but when questioned had said she had\nnot dreamed. When Sig1\"i Maria got up, about 9.30, the child asked\nfor a story, and on being told that Signa Maria did not know any,\nsaid, \" Then I will tell you one, only I have forgotten\u2014that little\ngirl has told me so many pretty ones ! \" Sign\" Maria asked, \" What\nlittle girl 1 \" \" The one I know, the one who always comes. She was\ndressed in blue, and we were in a boat with two oars, and we went to\nthe Gardens. There were lots of horses, and the sea said ' vuuh ! ' \"\n(imitating the sound which Elvira had produced motorially the evening\nbefore). \" We played on the grass, and she ran more than I did ; she\ntold me so many stories, but I have forgotten them.\" She made no\nmention of other persons being in the boat, and, as only Elvira and not\nMaria knew the programme, she, of course, could not question the\nchild on the point.\nI have experimented on this subject with other secondary personalities.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 245\nThe following night, as I had proposed no dream, Angelina's mind\nwas free, and she told the last dream again on the next day, adding\nthat in those gardens (the Lido) there was also a tramway, anil that\nthe blue child had made her ride, and had then told her stories to\nprevent her being frightened.1\nIt is to be observed that the word \" vuuh \" by which Elvira\nimitated the roar of the sea before the dream, and Angelina after it,\nis commonly, and one may say almost inevitably, used by any one who\nwishes to imitate this sound.\n[In this case, as in others], the dreams do not always follow the\nprogramme with exactitude. The points of identity are, however,\nsuch as to begin to produce a conviction that they cannot be mere\nchance coincidences. It must be remembered that at first Elvira did\nnot understand the aim of these experiments, and, as she herself after\nwards told me, she omitted some things as of no importance, and added\nothers to make the dream prettier. When this was clear to me, I asked\nElvira to aim first of all at precision, upon which the successes sensibly\nimproved. This again demonstrates the necessity of considering the\nactive personality, as otherwise its idiosyncrasies may be taken for\ngeneral laws.\nOctober 30lh.\u2014Signa Maria was again ill in bed. She told me that\nto-day Angelina had asked her to make a frock and buy a pair of\nshoes for the blue child, who must be cold in her blue chemise and\nwith bare feet. I mention this to show that the child's dreams were\nvivid enough for her to confound them with reality.\nDreams of Various Objects.\nExperiment 6.\u2014October 3lsl, 1892.\u2014Elvira manifested in the\ntrance motorially, and promised to make another dream experiment that\nnight. Seeing that I could not think of a subject, she proposed as\nfollows. She would take the child to Venice and show her the regatta\nfrom the Rialto ; red will win.\nI wished again to study the manner in which imitative sounds are\nperceived (see dream of October 28th-29th), so I told Elvira that I\nwished the child to hear thefru-fru which the prows of the boats\nmake in cutting the water, and I asked her to make the sound so that\nI might know what characteristic it acquired when reproduced by\nSigna Maria, in the character of Elvira. She emitted the prolonged\nsound ff,jf, which is really a better imitation of the real sound.\nTo my question whether she needed a longer time to act to produce\na dream apparently long, she replied, \" One or two minutes longer. We\ncan produce dreams which seem to you to last for hours in a short time.\"\n' As Venetian children are not Used to horsea, they are generally afraid of them.\n\f246 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\nI left Siglla Maria ignorant of all that had happened during her\ntrance.\nNovember 1st.\u2014I wished to hear this dream directly from Angelina,\n.who was usually sleeping or dozing in the evening, so I called on\nJgigna Maria during the day. As she knew nothing, she had not\nquestioned Angelina, who had said nothing spontaneously. But as she\nwas shy, instead of telling me anything she began to cry. I therefore\nleft her, asking Signa Maria, who was still in ignorance, to question her\npatiently. When I went back in the evening, Signa Maria told me all\nshe had been able to extract from the child. She had thought last\nnight that she was at Venice on the Hiva del Vino, close to the\nRialto, in the company of the usual blue child. The small steamboats\nfor passenger service had stopped running, and the boats were not\nabout as usual. Instead there were some boats which went very fast,\nrowed by men dressed in different colours. The water dividing before\ntheir prows made the sound gro, gro. The boat in front carried two\nmen dressed in red. Elvira and Angelina fanned themselves with a\nlarge fan.\nThis time the child made use of an imitative sound unlike Elvira's;\ngjgna Maria said she could not reproduce it, as Angelina accompanied\nit by a breathing, which, however, did not make it the more resembleff.\nWe have also in this case a slight variation, for the point of view was the\nRiva del Vino and not the Rialto ; and the fan was an addition. But\nthese particulars are chiefly of use to weaken the hypothesis that the\ndream was produced by a verbal suggestion from the personality of\nElvira.\nThis evening Elvira refused to make Angelina dream,1 saying that\nshe would be occupied elsewhere.2\n1 It may be worth noting that ou this night Angelina had a dream which was\npossibly of telepathic origin, but which took place without any voluntary actios on\nthe part of Signorina Maria and apparently without the agency of the Elvira\npersonality. The following are Dr. Ermacora's notes of the incident :.\u2014\" November\n2nd, 1892.\u2014Maria tells me that last night (November 1\u20142) Angelina\u2014who should\nnot have been influenced by Elvira\u2014dreamt that she was in a room where there was\na table in the middle, a piano, a buffet having no cupboard with glass doors above\nit, and a sofa. Several persons were there, including Signorina Maria and Dr.\nErmacora.\" He states that this description exactly fits a room to which he used to\ngo with Signorina Maria and other persons to carry on experiments, except that\nthere was a small harmonium instead of a piano in it. There was reason to think\nthat Angelina had never heard of this place. Dr. Ermacora observes that if the\ndream was telepathic, it was the only case of the kind that occurred during the course\nof these experiments spontaneously and without the action of Elvira.\u2014Ed.\n2 Even those who do not admit the possibility of the independence of a secondary\nor mediumistic intelligence must take count of this form of expression, although they\noften a priori consider it meaningless. We must remember that nothing is meaning\nless, and to say a thing has no meaning simply implies that as yet it has none for us.\nIn this case, the phrase \"Elvira occupied elsewhere\" may be supposed to mean the\nactivity personifying itself as Elvira operating telepathieally elsewhere.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 247\nExperiment 7.\u2014November 2nd.\u2014I asked Elvira if she would\ninduce a dream this night. She answered (automatic script), \" We\nhave always succeeded till now ; we will try again this evening.\"\nI had arranged the dream beforehand. I proposed that Elvira,\ndressed in red and with a large straw hat on, should accompany\nAngelina to the Piazza San Marco at Venice, and should find it\nturned into a garden with grass and many flowers. The campanile\nshould have vanished, and there should be a very large tree in its\nplace. Many children, dressed in white, should be running and\nplaying with young goats. A peasant on the great tree should saw\noff a branch, and Angelina should heaf the saw make the sound zin-zin.\nIt will be seen that this experiment was again arranged in order\nto discover if the child had a direct perception of images in the\ndreams, or if they were replaced by words. The programme was too\ncomplicated. But Professor William James, of Cambridge University,\nU.S., had honoured me by his presence, and I was so imprudent as to\nventure among difficulties not yet overcome, with the hope of showing\nhim a more interesting result, forgetting that any small disturbance,\nsuch as the introduction of a stranger, has a tendency to diminish, or\neven entirely prevent, success.\nWhen I asked Elvira if she hoped to succeed, in spite of the\nunusual complexity of the dream, she answered (by automatic\nwriting), \" It is rather long. It is possible for me, but I don't know\nif the child will remember all that. However, we will try.\"\nQuestion. \" Could you not induce dreams with persons better able\nto remember and relate them 1 \"\nAnswer. \" But. you see, it answers so well with her that if you will\nhave patience you will succeed. I am not certain, but still I think\nthat the one at Venice (Angelina's sister) would answer the purpose\nas well.\"\nIt is quite natural that I should be dissatisfied at having for a\nsubject a child of an age which prevented her lending intelligent\nassistance, and who was shy with me, which prevented my studying\nher closely. Therefore I tried occasionally to propose a different\npercipient to Elvira ; but my efforts were vain, and it is easy to\nsuppose that it would be difficult to find a person who was a good\npercipient in rapport with Elvira, and who could besides be made use\nof as a subject of study. Then we must consider that the child's\ninnocence offered me opportunities of making interesting observations\nwhich might have been impossible with an adult.\nNovember 3rd.\u2014When I called on Signa Maria in the morning the\nchild had not yet told her anything, and she had not thought of\nquestioning her. This showed Sig1ni Maria's want of interest, which\nwas rather an advantage than not, as it prevented her curiosity or\n\f248 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nuntimely zeal from disturbing the results. And though she had no-\ninitiative, she was careful and punctual in executing my instruc\ntions. She and I questioned the child together, but her replies were\nvague and often contradictory. She seemed only ' to remember that\nshe had been in the company of Elvira, who was dressed in red, in a\nplace surrounded by a wall where there was grass, and many little\ngirls dressed in various colours, who were playing with toys. She did\nnot appear to have recognised the Piazza S. Marco ; on the contrary,\nshe said the wall was smooth and that there were no shops ; she had\nnot even had the impression that the scene was in Venice. This can\nnot be called more than a partial success ; but it is worth observing\nthat if the dream had been produced by verbal suggestion, the words\nPiazza San Marco must have been used, and would have aroused the\ncorresponding idea clearly in the child.\nThe partial failure was, as I understood later, no doubt partly\ncaused by our having made Angelina relate her dream in my presence,\nwhich disturbed her ; she appeared so uncertain, contradictory, and\nsuggestible that I soon learned to place most faith in the second-hand\naccounts of Sig,la Maria or her mother.\nExperiment 8. \u2014 November 4th. \u2014 Elvira manifested motorially\nduring Sign\" Maria's trance, after having manifested sensorially as usual.\nWhen questioned as to the preceding incomplete success, she replied\nthat she had evoked the pre-arranged dream exactly, but that the child\nhad not remembered it. I proposed the following dream for the next\nnight :\u2014.\nElvira would come to Angelina, accompanied by the latter's dead\nmother, who would bring her a pretty blue hood. Elvira asked that\nthe dream should be modified, not wishing to cause too great an\nimpression on the child through her mother's presence, and proposed\nto substitute a greatraunt, who was just then at Milan. She thought\nthe dream simple and easy to induce, and again recommended that the\nchild should be questioned directly she woke.\nNovember 5th.\u2014Signor Carlo Vanzetti and Dr. E. T. (who are\ninterested in psychical phenomena) and myself, called on Sig1n1 Maria\nabout 2.30 p.m. I had forgotten to repeat Elvira's advice to Sign*\nMaria the preceding evening, and the latter had not questioned the\nchild. So we interrogated her ourselves. Fortunately she was in an\nexpansive humour, and told us that the blue child had come to see her\nwith the great-aunt from Milan, who had a blue hood, but she could\nnot explain if it was on her head or in her hand, and contradicted\nherself. There were many ribbons on the hood, as well as the plaits o\u00a3\nAngelina's hair, which had been cut off. She did not know if her aunt,\nmeant it for a present to her. She added that the blue child w&s\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 249\nnot really dressed in blue, but in white. I only mention this unim\nportant point, which was outside the programme, to remark afresh\nnow much the effect of these dreams on the child resembles that of\nreal waking events ; thus Maria told us that to-day Angelina had\nwanted to wear her white frock, to he like Elvira.\nWe put ourselves in rapport with Elvira, and asked her why the aunt\nhad not given the hood to Angelina as pre-arranged. Elvira replied\n(by automatic writing), \" No ; her aunt put it down and I took it up to\nshow it to her (Angelina).\" This may be true, and the child may have\nforgotten it. It was a mistake on my part not to ask for an explana\ntion about the locks of hair, which were not in the programme ; all\nthe more that they had some connection with the aunt. Bign* Maria told\nus that this aunt had been much vexed when Angelina's hair was cut\noff after her mother's death, because there was no one to arrange it.\nExperiment 9.\u2014The child was sent away, and Signor Vanzetti\nproposed the following dream to Elvira. She should appear in\ncompany with Signa Maria's mother, who should present Angelina\nwith a large cake, which she should open. A little bird should come\nout and fly away, laughing.\nNovember 6th.\u2014I went to see Signa Maria about 2.30 p.m., and\nfound Signor Vanzetti already there. We had arranged that he should\neall to see if the attempt were a success or not. The child was present\nand had already told her dream as follows :\u2014The blue child had come\nto her with Sig1ni Maria's mother 1 who brought her a cake. From a\nhole in the cake came out (Angelina failed to find the word).\nVanzetti. \"A mouse?\" Angelina. \" No.\" V. \"A cat?\" A. \"No.\"\nV. \"Then it must have been a dog.\" A. \" Yes.\" V. \" Was it like a\nhen?\" A. \"No; like a pigeon, but smaller.\"\nThis dialogue shows that the child probably saw a small bird, but\nit also shows how easy it is to lead her astray by suggestive or even\nnon-suggestive questions made by persons who do not possess her full\nconfidence.\nWe sent her away and placed ourselves in communication with\nElvira, who manifested through automatic writing, and then in the\ntrance sensorially, and at last motorially.\n1 1 cannot say with certaintythat the success was complete, as regards the presence\nof Signora. Annetta in the dream, for Dr. E.T.,whom I met in the course of the day, said\nbe did not remember the introduction of Signorina M. 's mother into the programme.\nI am obliged to report this circumstance, but I find the point recorded in my notes of\nthe 5th, or at most of the 6th November ; and besides the arbitrary introduction of\nanother person into the dream would have caused me to question Elvira about it, or\natleast I should have made notes after the success; and I find I did neither the one\ntot the other. As Signor C. Vanzetti had left at once, I could not trust entirely to\nlas memory. The point besides is of little importance.\n\f250 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nExperiment 10.\u2014Signor Vanzetti proposed the following dream :\u2014\nWhile the child was aware of being in her own bed, Elvira should come\nand kiss her forehead, then put her hands underneath her body and\ncarry her to her father in Venice. Then she should bring her back to\nher own bed.\nNovember 7th.\u2014Doctor E. T. and I visited Signa Maria, who was\nignorant of the dream, which had been planned while she was in the\ntrance. However she had followed her instructions and questioned the\nchild in the morning ; but the latter would tell nothing, and had said\nshe was bored by always dreaming of Elvira. She was sufficiently\ndocile to relate her dream to us, notwithstanding. She said that last\nnight the blue child came to her and kissed her on the chin. She took\nher to Venice in a carriage drawn by a horse, went with her to her\nfather, who kissed her on her forehead, and then flew home with her\nthrough the air.\nAs we see, the variations from the programme are not great. The\nfollowing day (November 8th) I asked Elvira, \" Did you make the\nslight changes in the dream of the 6th-7th, or did she forget ? \" She\nreplied (by automatic writing), \" No ; you know it is I who make\nthese little changes. I do not think there is any harm, but if so tell\nme, and I will not do it any more.\" I naturally recommended exact\nness, and the results seemed to me to improve.\nNovember 8th.\u2014No dream had been pre-arranged, and Angelina\nhad a spontaneous one, which is not odd. But it is curious that,\nthough she was used to pleasant dreams, this night she dreamt of a.\nman with horns, in whom she believed she recognised the devil ; and\nshe remarked that she would rather see the blue child again than\ndream such things. So that this dream would seem to have been a.\nreaction, either spontaneous or imposed from outside, against the\nprotests she had made against the too persistent dreams about\nElvira.\nExperiment 11.\u2014While Elvira manifested in automatic writing, I\nproposed a dream which it is useless to relate, because it was a\ncomplete failure, in spite of Elvira's acceptance of it.\nExperiment 12.\u2014November 9th.\u2014I proposed the following dream\nfor the next night :\u2014Angelina, with Sigl^ Maria, would be at the-\nwindow of her own room, and would look towards the river. A\nlamb would be grazing on the bank. A boat loaded with apples would\npass, conducted by one boatman. He would stop close to the iroa\nbridge, and get out to drink at the inn. While the boat was.\nunguarded the lamb would jump in and begin to eat the apples, whicl*\nwould make Angelina laugh very much.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 251\nI will explain my aim with regard to the detail of the inn. [It\nexemplifies a method of control which] has the advantage of passing\nentirely unperceived by the personalities to which it is applied, or at\nleast by their supraliminal selves. This consists in introducing into\nthe programme of the dream some idea which, when perceived\nsensorially and objectively, would produce a different effect on the\nsubject than if it had been expressed verbally ; or in introducing\nsensorial images, which, with regard to the percipient, should not\nbe in perfect correspondence with his verbal images. It is evident\nthat if the dream were originated by verbal suggestion, the\npercipient, in most cases, will mention even the circumstances which he\nhas not seen, or will describe his experience in proper terms ; while,\non the other hand, if the scene were perceived by means of direct\nimages of the things, we must expect that he will be ignorant of every\naccessory circumstance mentioned in the programme, but not present\nin the scene ; he will form mistaken judgments about the things,\nperceived, and will give them inappropriate names. The dream of the\nPiazza S. Marco transformed into a garden is a good example of this.\n(November 2rvl-3rd, 1892). Thus, in the present case, if Signa Maria\nsuggests the dream verbally to Angelina, it is improbable that she will\nomit the particular about the inn, and it is besides probable that the\nchild, knowing the reason for the boatman's absence, will have some\nsensorial image of it, and will mention it in her account. Whereas if\nshe perceives the scene directly, she will see the boatman go away, but\nwill not be able to say why or where\u2014the inn not being visible from\nthe window at which she will be.\nAngelina was in bed and asleep, with the door shut, while I\nexplained this programme to Elvira. When I left I asked Siga\nAnnetta1 to take care that her daughter and the child should not meet\ndaring the night, and as she and Angelina generally wake before Signa\nMaria, I asked her to get the child to relate her dream before\nSign\" Maria awoke, or at least before they met.\nThis intervention of Siga Annetta was of great advantage, although\nit did not do away with the inconvenience of my getting the story at\nsecond-hand. It allowed of the child being questioned by a person\nwho was not only ignorant of what dreams were expected, but who\nalso did not know what interest Angelina's dreams could have for me,\nand who did not trouble herself about it. She could not, therefore,\nalter them by involuntary suggestion. I may add that she fulfilled my\n1 It is well to keep in mind that during the communications with Elvira, only\nSignorioa Maria and I were present, except in the few cases always mentioned,when I\nwent withsome person not of Signorina Maria's family. Signora Annetta wasunaware\nof the existence of the Elvira personality, and of that of others resembling her, and\nAngelina knows Elvira only through her dreams.\n\f252 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\n.charge with so much patience that the child ended by being unwilling\nto tell her dreams to anybody else.\nNovember 10th.\u2014About 4 p.m. I called to discover the results. I\nsaw Siga Annetta first, and she was convinced that no communica\ntion had been possible between the child and Signa Maria till the\nmorning. Angelina told her the dream before Signa Maria was awake.\nIt is useless to repeat it, as it corresponds almost exactly to the pro\ngramme. I say almost, because there are two points of difference\nwhich are precisely what render the result most interesting. One is\nthat Angelina called the animal which ate the apples a \" light-coloured\ndog,\" instead of a \"lamb.\" Now the child, being a Venetian, had not\nseen any lambs, and when she saw one, she naturally baptised it in her\nown fashion. The other point of difference is that she did not say\nwhere the boatman had gone, and, when questioned on the point on\nmy arrival, she could not explain it, though she remembered the dream\nperfectly. According to what was said above, these two particulars\nfavour the hypothesis that the child sees the scene, instead of simply\nhearing it described.\nExperiment 13.\u2014The usual communication with Elvira having\nbeen established, she declared herself ready for a fresh experiment the\nfollowing night.\nI read the programme I had written down a few moments before:\u2014\nAngelina is in the Piazza dei Signori (Padua) with Siga Annetta. It\nsnows, and the Piazza is white. Angelina is amused at the sight, but\nstops suddenly to look with astonishment at a spot in front of the\nCaffe' Mio, where the snow is black instead of white, because just before\nAngelina's arrival a man had passed with a sack of coal dust ; the sa^k\nhad burst and the coal d%ist was spilt on the snow. I underline the\nlast words in order to emphasise the fact that they relate to a circum\nstance extraneous to the dream, and are designed to put the form of\nperception to the proof. While I was reading the programme in the\nusual room on the first floor, the child was playing outside the street\ndoor with other little girls, and could have heard nothing.\nNovember Wth. Evening.\u2014Siga Annetta assured me that neither\nlast evening after I left nor during the night had her daughter and\nthe child had any communication relating to the dream ; they had\nnever been out of her sight. The evening before they had all gone\ntogether to call on another son of Sig* Annetta's, who is married\nand does not live with them. There Angelina fell asleep, and was\ncarried home, and put to bed in her own room by Sigi Annetta.\nwithout having awoke. Signa Maria and her mother slept together as\nusual. The child told her dream to Sig Annetta in the morning\nbefore Signa Maria was awake. The account was as follows :\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 253\nAngelina had been in the Piazza dei Signori with Siga Annetta.\nThere was much hail on the ground, and outside the Caffe Tuo (as\nthe child was accustomed to call it) the ground was black like coal.\nSig\"a Maria in her turn told me that she had gone out later with the\nchild, who, passing through the Piazza before-mentioned, related the\nstory over again, repeating that the ground had been white with hail.\nSig01 Maria asked her if the white stuff might not have been snow, to\nwhich the child replied, \" No ! what is snow? It was hail ; the ground\nwas white, but near the Caffe Tuo it was black instead\u2014all coal ;\nand I ran on the white. It was such fun.\" She wanted to accompany\nSig0* Maria to the side of the Piazza, where she had seen the coal ; and\nto explain better, showed her the black colour which formed the back\nground of the glass windows, and said that at that part of the ground it\nwas blacker even than that. I at first thought it odd that the child\nshould call the white stuff on the ground hail. But later Sign\" Maria\ndiscovered that the child had never seen snow. This ambiguity about\na name could not have happened under better conditions for excluding\nthe hypothesis of verbal suggestion, because, as Signa Maria could not\nknow that the child called snow hail, she would naturally have used the\nterm snow, which would not have been understood by Angelina, and\ntherefore would not have produced the image of the whiteness on the\nground.\nExperiment 14.\u2014November 12th. Evening.\u2014I went to see Signa\nMaria, with the programme of the next dream ready written. During\nthe communication with Elvira (by automatic writing) I read this\nprogramme to Maria, word for word: \"Angelina is with me in the\nchurch of S. Marco at Venice. Elvira, dressed in pink and with a\nwhite handkerchief round her head, comes to meet us, and all three go\nto the Riva degli Schiavoni, and go into a tent, where we are shown a\nfine tiger.\"\nAs I saw that the results, if telepathically produced, were\nbecoming more and more important, I desired to increase the rigour of\nthe conditions. I therefore asked Siga Annetta to lock the child's\nroom directly she was asleep, to hide the key, to unlock the room in\nthe morning, and to induce Angelina to relate the dream before any\ncommunication with Sig\"a Maria was possible.\nNovember 13<A. Evening.\u2014Siga Annetta told me that Angelina\nwas already asleep when I left last evening. She found her daughter\nin bed, and followed her, tying the key round her neck. She herself\nwoke with the key still tied round her neck, and when the child called\nshe ran to open the door. Angelina at once, while Sign Maria still\nslept, told the following dream :\u2014She was with me at Venice in the\nchurch of S. Marco. A little girl entered dressed in pink, with a\nx\n\f254 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nwhite handkerchief on her head. We all went together to a little\nhouse, where there was an animal like a cat, but larger, and not really\na cat.\nHere, again, the visual, and not the verbal, image of a tiger was\nprobably perceived. i We have besides the circumstance that Elvira\nwas seen, because Angelina mentioned the pre-arranged details of the\npink dress and white handkerchief, but she was not recognised. [These\npoints, again, tell against the hypothesis that] the dream was induced\nby verbal suggestion.\nExperiment 15. \u2014While Elvira was manifesting sensorially she, in\nreply to my questions, caused Maria in the trance, to tell me she could\nmake the child see in dreams even things unknown to Signa Maria, but\nknown to herself and to me.\nI wished to try the experiment at once, and proposed that she\nshould make Angelina see the interior of a house I had examined a\nshort time ago, and which was entirely unknown to Signa Maria, being\nin a village some kilometres from Padua, where she had never been.\nElvira had said on a previous occasion that she knew this house ; thus\nher proposed conditions were realised. Our programme was that\nAngelina should find herself in this house with her little sister.\nSignor C, who lived there, would give them sweetmeats, and would\neither show them over the house or round the neighbourhood of it.\nNovember 14<A. 3 p.m.\u2014-Siga Annetta was alone in the house.\nShe told me that from the moment I left on the previous evening she\nhad taken the same precautions as on the night before, including the\nlocking up of Angelina. Directly the child awoke she related the\nfollowing dream :\u2014\nEnrichetta (her little sister) had taken her to a garden where there\nwas much grass, and in the midst a large house. They played, and an\nold gentleman gave them two boxes of sweetmeats and took them in to\nsee the house, which was large, and neither pretty nor ugly.\nAlthough all this is correct, I cannot consider the dream a success,\nso far as the representation of a place unknown to Signa Maria is\nconcerned, because the description is too indefinite.\nExperiment 16.\u2014November 1bth.\u2014I was at Signa Maria's house at\n2 p.m. Elvira said she hoped to show the child places unknown both\nto Signa Maria and me, but known to herself. As T could not invent\na dream of this kind on the spot (up to the present time I have not\nseen one such realised), I proposed the following which I had prepared\nin writing for the day before :\u2014\n\" Angelina will still be in the country house of the preceding\ndream, and will be eating boiled potatoes with Professor B. Then 1\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 255\nshall come and bring her some Indian figs. (As Elvira said she did not\nknow what Indian figs were, I substituted common figs.) Afterwards\nI shall take her and Professor B. to see the neighbourhood ; I shall tell\nAngelina to be very fond of me, and to let herself be sent to sleep\nby me.\"\nThis programme had among other aims : ( 1 ) To refresh the vision\nof the surroundings of the house, which should furnish characteristic\npoints for recognition, if the representation should prove exact ; (J)\n. to see if a sufficiently exact visual perception of a person wholly\nunknown to Angelina, but known to 8igna Maria (as is Professor B.),\nis possible ; and (3) having used visual images exclusively until now, to\nsee if auditory images would be perceived equally well, and if verbal\nimages could lle used for making suggestions ; as, if that were the case,\nthey could tie utilised to forward our present researches.\nThe most simple method of proving the telepathic origin of these\ndreams would naturally be to ask Elvira to induce a certain dream in\nthe child on the spot ; then, when Elvira had given us notice that her\nown action was completed, to wake the little one and make her recount\nthe dream. But in this way we should have encountered two\ndifficulties. The first is, that Elvira says she can only act when the\nchild is in deep and tranquil sleep, which does not easily happen in the\nevening ; the second is that to wake her would put her out of temper,\nso that it would be difficult to get any coherent account from her.\nBeing thus doubtful of results, I put off this experiment till the time\nwhen I should have succeeded in putting her into the somnambulic\nstate, when I could control her sleep and her temper. This is why I\nwished Elvira's suggestion to come to my aid. However, up to the\npresent time my efforts have been unsuccessful, and I have been\nsatisfied with the proofs which I have succeeded in obtaining later, so\nthat I dropped this method for the time being, always intending to try\nit again when circumstances were propitious.\nNovember 1\u00a7th, 2 p.m.\u2014I found only Signa Maria and the child at\nhome. Angelina told me as follows :\u2014She had dreamed of being in\na large house in the country, but could not explain if it was the same\nshe had seen in the preceding dream. She was with a handsome, tall,\nand rather stout gentleman, with beautiful long moustaches. Then I\narrived and brought her some figs which she found sweet. I told her\nto be good, and to let me put her to sleep. Questioned about the\nneighbourhood of the house, she could say nothing to prove that she\nhad seen it as it really is. Besides which, she did not remember\neating with the gentleman before I came.\nI took out of my pocket 17 photographs which I had prepared.\nThat of Professor B. was among them. The others also were portraits\nof men of middle-age, and offered a certain resemblance to him ; such a\nx 2\n\f256 Dr. G. B. Ermaeora.\nresemblance as would make it difficult for an adult, and impossible for\na child, to distinguish that of Professor B. from the others, after a\nmere verbal description.\nI promised the child some sweetmeat if she could find her dream\ngentleman among the 17 portraits. Meantime I watched Signa Maria,\nto see if she influenced Angelina by any unconscious sign. The latter\nseemed very tired, or perhaps confused by the novelty of the thing,\nand could not decide. I stopped her when I found she was looking\nabout, instead of at the photographs.\nMeanwhile Sign Annetta had returned and I instructed her to\ninduce the child to 3earch for the portrait when her daughter was not\npresent, lest the latter should unconsciously influence her. Siga Annetta\nherself could not influence the results, for she does not know Professor\nB., and is also ignorant that the gentleman Angelina saw in her dream\nis so named.\nWhen I returned in the evening, Sig1 Annetta assured me that\nher daughter had not seen the photographs since I left, and that the\nchild had made her choice while Signa Maria was out of the house.\nShe then showed me two photographs that the child had selected,\nadding that she had preferred one of the two. Now, the portrait\npreferred as most resembling the gentleman in the dream is precisely\nthat of Professor B., and the other is sufficiently like to be taken for\nhis portrait, even by an adult who had only glanced at the original.\nThe resemblance fails in one point. Professor B.'s moustaches are very\nlong, and those in the second photograph are rather short.\nI should add that the choice was made among 27 portraits1 instead\nof 17 ; I added 10 more when I left.\nExperiment 17.\u2014I read the programme I had prepared for the\ncoming night to Elvira this same evening.\nAngelina is at Desenzano upon the lake of Garda with Elvira and\nme. I am dressed in white linen and have a straw hat. Elvira has a\nred dress and a wreath of blue flowers. We look for a boat to take\nus to Sirmione, but cannot find one. Then we go the whole way on\nfoot. When we reach Sirmione, Elvira and I recommend Angelina to\nremember the dreams well and to relate them with exactness.\nThis programme had a special aim. Some time ago Elvira had said\nshe knew the lake of Garda and its neighbourhood. I also know them a\nlittle, while Signa Maria and Angelina have never been there. There\nfore, I wished the dream to give Elvira a new opportunity to show the\n1 Dr. Ermaeora has sent me all the photographs in question for comparison.

I was\ntold that Angelina had not had any dream, and that she had been\nrather restless during the night.1\nExperiment 18.\u2014Elvira communicated in automatic writing. I\nasked her if she could try the same dream again the next night, and if\nshe would like me to repeat it. She replied, \"Yes, if I can make her\ndream, I will. You need not repeat it ; I know it quite well.\"\nA result which I had aimed at from the beginning, because it would\nhave offered me a most simple and certain proof of the telepathic origin\nof these dreams, was their realisation at a distance which would have\nmade any communication between Maria and Angelina impossible.\nThis wish had remained unfulfilled. Such experiments were [for various\nreasons] not easy, and I accordingly deferred trying the plan till I had\nexhausted the easier methods of control.\nJust then Angelina's father desired to see her and keep her at\nhome for a few days. Signil Maria was to take her, and as Angelina's\nfather had not room for her also, she would be obliged to pass the night\nat a distance from the child. This was a propitious circumstance, and\nI decided to go to Venice on the same day as Sign* Maria, November\n18th.\nNovember 18th.\u2014 I went to Venice and met Sign* Maria about noon.\nShe had arrived an hour sooner than I. She told me that her mother\nhad unlocked Angelina's room that morning and found her already\nawake. Sign\" Maria entered the room while Angelina was telling the\ndream to Siga Annetta, and thus it was she who related it to me.\nAngelina had dreamt she was in the country with me and the\nblue child. I was dressed in white, and my hands were very much\nlarger than was natural. Elvira had blue flowers on her head. We\nall went to look for a boat, but not being able to find one, I went on\nfoot, while Angelina and the blue child were transported through\nspace. Angelina, when she awoke, thought she was still in the air.\nIn reply to Sign\" Maria's questions she replied that there were many\nhouses and banks like those in the Gardens, but larger.2 She did not\nremember the colour of Elvira's dress, nor what hat I wore, but when\nclosely questioned said that the dress was red ; she would not admit\nthat my hat was of straw, but said it was of soft brown felt, like my\n1 As Angelina's little room was next to that occupied by Signorina Maria and her\nmother, they could easily hear if she woke, because she became alarmed at finding\nherself alone, and called to them.\n1 Angelina has never been in a hilly country, so she could only express the idea of\nmountains by amplifying that of the banks or hills of the public garden at Venice.\n\f258 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nusual one. She did not remember that Elvira and I had said anything\nto her. She added that there was a great deal of water, but that it\nseemed less than in the lagoon at Venice.\nThe dream was therefore successful in its general outlines, but\nthere was no point in it which did not probably pre-exist in the mind\nof Signa Maria.\nExperiment 19.\u2014In the evening I called on Sig'la Maria and tried\nto communicate with Elvira. But instead of Elvira, Adriano mani\nfested in automatic writing. Does the non-appearance of Elvira, con\nsidered from the point of view that these personalities are mere\ndramatisations of more complex subliminal phenomena,1 signify a\nrefusal to attempt the experiment 1 This is the interpretation which\nsuddenly occurred to me as the most natural one, but Adriano\nexplained that he was sent by Elvira, who was much vexed at not\nbeing able to come. In the end I told Adriano the programme.\nNovember 19<A.\u2014Towards midday Signa Maria and I went to the\nhome of Angelina, who could barely remember that she had dreamt\nof the blue child and nothing more. The failure is complete, because\nElvira did not figure in the programme I had communicated to Adriano\novernight. Later, in another place, I questioned Elvira about the\ncause of the failure. She replied in automatic writing, and attributed\nit to the too light and agitated sleep of the child.\nExperiment 20.\u2014I proposed to Elvira to try again, and gave her\nanother programme for the following night. Naturally I took care\nthat Signa Maria and Angelina should meet no more that evening.\nNovember 20th.\u2014I went in the morning with Signa Maria to see\nthe child, who told us she had had two dreams, neither of which had\nthe least connection with my programme. '\nI had here another opportunity of remarking how easy it was, by\nmeans of suggestive questions, to make Angelina relate any story I\nwished. However, to-day she was particularly pre-oecupied with the\nreturn to Padua,\u2014not because she regretted it, but because she feared\nher cousin would go without her. This pre-occupation, which drove\nthe dream from her mind, no doubt augmented her suggestibility, or\nrather her inclination to give heedless answers in order to put an end\nto a subject that did not interest her. This susceptibility, however,\n1 This hypothesis does not affect the utility of the study of these personalities, upon\nwhich I have insisted from the first. On the contrary, it is clear that if they are\nnothing more than the translation into supraliminal terms of subliminal operations\ninaccessible to our intelligence, they would constitute the real keys which yield\naccess to the study of the transcendental man. To neglect studying them would be\nlike the neglect of the study of hieroglyphics by a person who wished to penetrate the\nmysteries of ancienf Egypt.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 259\nby no means weakens the telepathic interpretation of the successful\ncases. In the various cases concerning which I myself interrogated\nher, I certainly could not mistake my suggestions for her dreams.\nWhen Sign\" Maria questioned the child, I could trust to her good\nsense and to her exactness in following my indications, which was\nalso evidenced by the care she showed in bringing forward the\npoints of discrepancy. But in the greater number of cases, and\nthose the most interesting, the child related the dream to 8igt\nAnnetta, who knew absolutely nothing of the programme fixed.\nOn the evening of the same day (November 20th) we had all\nreturned to Padua. By no means discouraged at the negative result\nof this little telepathic expedition, I called on Sig\" Maria again in the\nevening. Elvira manifested in automatic writing, [and\u2014after explain\ning that the child's susceptibility to her influence had l\u00ab.-en disturbed\nby the presence of strangers\u2014said finally,] \" I warn you there will be\nno dream to-night, because the child is too excited with her journey ;\nanother night perhaps ; to-night I can promise nothing.\"\nNovember 21st.\u2014[No dream proposed.]\nExperiment 21.\u2014November 23rd.\u2014I proposed the following dream\nfor the next night:\u2014Angelina was to be among the hills with a peasant\nof the mountains, who had a basket on her back. They were to climb\na rough path, and Angelina would be tired. Then the peasant would\nput her in the basket and carry her. This peasant was to be Angelina's\ngrandmother, who was then at Milan. I chose a mountainous scene\nou purpose, because the child had never seen one, and thus we should\nbe able to discover traces of verbal suggestion or of direct perception.\nIt was still day when I left, so the experiment was not protected\nby the usual blockade.1\nNovember 24<A, 4 p.m.\u2014Signa Maria told nlfe that the dream had\ntaken place with precision. Angelina had told her that her grand\nmother at Milan looked ugly dressed up like that with a handkerchief\non her head. The basket in which she had been carried was like those\nused at Venice for carrying coals.\nIt is evident that Angelina perceived the scene with more details\nthan were mentioned in my programme, as she saw her grandmother's\nheadkerchief as it is worn by our mountaineers. It is not rare to see,\nWh at Venice aud Padua, mountaineers with basket and kerchief.\nHowever, as we have seen, the waking Angelina associates the basket\nwith the coal vendors of Venice, instead of with women with kerchiefs\non their heads.2\n1 1 mean by thia word any precaution taken to prevent normal communication\nbrtween the subjects.\n- My notes taken at the time do not make it clear that the child saw the mountain\nscenery. But I believe I remember that she spoke of a fatiguing path and many stones.\n\f260 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\nExperiment 22.\u2014The dream I proposed for the next night need not\nbe stated, as it did not take place, possibly for the following reasons.\ngjgna Maria's father, who was old and ill, was at this time in\nVenice. On the evening of this day, November 24th, she received\nnotice that he was very ill, and she and her mother decided to go to\nVenice next day. During the night Signa Maria dreamt that she\nsaw her father, as thin as a skeleton, as she had never seen him in life,\nrise slowly from his bed into the air. She woke suddenly with the im\npression that he was dead and found (she does not remember how) that\nit was a little past 4 in the morning. The child also woke just then,\nand said that now it would be useless to go to Venice, for that her\ngrandfather was already chad.\nWhen they arrived at Venice they heard, in fact, that he had died\nshortly after 4 a.m. Signa Maria's grief prevented my attempting to\nprocure other information about the case. However, a short time after\nshe told me that she had heard from those about him that he had\nbecome exceptionally thin, as the dream had shown him.\nFor other reasons the dream experiments were interrupted for some\ndays. In the meantime, on the nights of November 28th, 29th, and\n30th, the child, who slept alone in her little room, awoke frightened\nabout 4.15 or 4.30, saying that she felt the bed shake, and heard\nscratching on the floor mat. It is curious that this should have\nhappened at the particular hour of Maria's dream.\nDuring this period I busied myself, without success, in preparing\nthe ground for the production of dreams under my direct control. I\ntried to habituate the child to the hypnotic sleep, but I only succeeded\nonce, and the one success was followed by several failures ; her want of\nattention makes her at present a bad hypnotic subject. [I also failed\nto persuade Elvira to help me in inducing sleep in the child.]\nExperiment 23.\u2014December 1Sth.\u2014Evening. I proposed the follow\ning dream to Elvira, who manifested in automatic writing :\u2014Angelina\nwas to be in a box at the theatre with Signa Maria and Signor G. M.\n(who is known to Signa Maria and also to the Elvira personality,\nbut is entirely unknown to the child). The spectacle was to be an\nequestrian circus, and Angelina was to be particularly pleased with a\nlittle white ass (somarello).\nThis dream had two aims. As Angelina had never been in a box\nat the theatre, this might give occasion for some discrepancy between\nthe visual images perceived and the terms which she might use in\nher account ; thus the hypothesis of verbal suggestion would be put\nto the proof. Further, I wished to repeat the experiment of the\nrecognition of the portrait of an unknown person seen for the first\ntime in a dream.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 26I\nBefore I left, and before Signa Maria had seen the child, the latter\nwas locked into her room, and I asked Siga Anne.tta to hide the key\ninstead of tying it round her neck, so that Elvira, if she should\npossibly manifest motorially during the night, should be unable to get\npossession of it and proceed to make verbal suggestions. (I have said\nthat Sig-i Annetta and her daughter slept in the same bed.)\nDecember 19th.\u20144 p.m. Signa Maria was in bed with a headache.\nSig\" Annetta (as usual ignorant of the programme) told me the dream\nwhich Angelina had related to her that morning ; it had nothing in\ncommon with the programme.\nExperiment 24.\u2014As I did not think it probable that the sus\npected verbal suggestion (which I judge to be impossible without\nthe trance) could take place in spite of Siga Annetta's vigilance\nduring the day, I charged the latter to renew the nightly blockade\nand bide the key, in the hope that the dream would occur on the\nsucceeding night.\nNo communication with Elvira to-day.\nDecember '20th, 4 p.m.\u2014Sign\" Maria was better, and I found her up.\nThis night the dream had taken place, and the child had related it in\nthe morning to Siga Annetta, whom she had seen before anybody else,\nand then to Signa Maria and the latter's brother.\nShe had thought she was in the theatre, in a tiny room which had\nno windows towards the street, but which had them towards the\ninside of the theatre. Signa Maria was there too, and also a very tall\ngentleman with a fair moustache. There were only a few people in\nthe middle of the theatre, but running horses instead. There was\nbesides an animal, a little donkey, white and small, which she liked so\nmuch that she wished to have it at home.\nI caused the child to tell me the story over again, and again\nI proved how easy it was to make her alter her story by suggestion.\nNaturally this detracts nothing from the value of the first spontaneous\naccount made to people who knew nothing of the programme.\nIt must be noticed that in this dream the verbal image box was\nentirely excluded, while Angelina translated the visual image into\nwords with childlike ingenuousness, which favours the hypothesis of\ndirect perception. The child did not recognise the portrait of Signor\nGl. M, which I gave to her among twenty others, and which she had\nfirst looked for in the presence of Sign- Annetta and her daughter-in-\nlaw, and then before me and Signa Maria ; on the contrary, on the\nlatter occasion she put it aside without hesitation.\nFrom time to time as the child told her story she turned towards\nSigna Maria for approbation, as if she were convinced that Signa Maria\n\f262 Dr. G. B. Ermacora,\n*\nhad been present at the scene ; and this shows how easily she confounds\nher dreams with reality.1\nI trust that the successive nocturnal blockades, although separated\nby the intervening day, need not be put down as inefficacious, since\nSigna Maria was in bed all day, and Sigi Annetta assured me that the\n-child only once entered her room for a few moments. Signa Maria\nassured me also that on account of the intense pain she suffered, she\nonly exchanged a few words with the child, and that no allusion was\nmade to the dream.\nExperiment 25.\u2014I proposed the following dream to Elvira for the\nnext night:\u2014Angelina is in a boat on the neighbouring canal with\nSiga Annetta and me. I am not rowing, but the boat is drawn by a\npair of swans, and I am seated at the prow guiding them with reins.\nThe other two are seated behind me. We go up the canal as far as\nthe astronomical observatory.\nWhen I went away, I left the twenty portraits, including that of\nSignor G. M., with Siga Annetta, to see if the child would recognise\nhim when she was left in quiet. Siga Annetta watched her all the\nevening, then locked her into her room and hid the key.\nDecember 2lst, 4 p.m.\u2014The first thing I heard when I entered the\nhouse was that Angelina had recognised the portrait of Signor G. M.\nSiga Annetta assured me she had found it when alone with her (she\nherself does not know Signor G. M., and did not know which portrait\nwas to be looked for). Angelina justified her first failure by explain\ning that that gentleman at the theatre was smiling, and that in the\nportrait he was very serious.2\nAngelina told me that she had dreamed last night that there was\na boat in the neighbouring canal and that I was in it. She could give\nme no other particulars, not even if she had also been in the boat : but\nwhen I re-visited Signa Maria in the evening she, upon being questioned,\nassured me that when Angelina told her dream in the morning, she\nhad said spontaneously that she was in the boat with me.\nThis success is evidently very incomplete, but it cannot be regarded\nas a chance coincidence if we consider it as a whole.\nExperiment 26.\u2014I asked Elvira if she was aware of people, places,\nactions, or other things unknown to Signa Maria, out of which I could\n1 I believe myself in a position to reject as an absurdity the hypothesis that the\nchild's story is a comedy taught her by Signorina Maria, and that consequently she\nturns ingenuously to the latter for suggestions ; and it is besides disproved by the\nlater successes under stricter conditions.\ns This photograph also has been sent to me by Dr. Ermacora.\u2014Ed.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 263\nmake dreams for Angelina. She replied, \" Yes ; I will even tell you\nthe dream for tonight, but I will only tell you this evening.\"\nI accepted the proposal, stipulating that I might add something\nmyself, to make sure that the nocturnal blockade should not be frus\ntrated by a previous communication with Angelina.\nIa the evening I asked Elvira for her programme, and she replied\nin automatic writing :\u2014.\" I think it would be fine to make Angelina\ndream that she was on the Lake of Garda with me, but then I will\nmake her see things which no traveller sees, but which exist notwith\nstanding, I assure you. Now tell me what you want to add to it.\" I\naccepted Elvira's programme, requesting as addition only that the\nwater of the lake should be as white as milk. Elvira replied, \" I must\nmake her see everything under water, but I can easily make it the\ncolour you want.:'\nWhen I left I saw Angelina already asleep on the ground floor. I\nmade the usual recommendations to Siga Annetta, though I knew there\nwas no need.\nDecember 2'2nd, 4.30 p.m.\u2014Angelina told me she had dreamt as\nfollows :\u2014She was with the blue child, who was dressed like a boy, in\ntrousers, with a large hat on her head. They went to a very large\nmm!, without bridges, and with trees on its banks. At first they\nwalked on the water without bathing themselves in it, and then they\nwent under it. There Angelina saw many broken houses, of which she\ncould distinguish the doors and windows ; there was also a church,\nbroken too, but not so much as the houses. She also heard bells ring,\nbut without seeing either bells or bell-tower. Then they both came\nout quite dry, and the blue child kissed her, and said, \" I am going to\nParadise, and you must take care to remember the dream.\" The water\nwas the colour of water and anise.\nSign* Maria and Siga Annetta assured me that the dream had been\ntold the same way in the morning, and first, as usual, to Siga Annetta,\nwhen her daughter was not present. The night before, Angelina had\nbeen put to bed directly I left by Siga Annetta, who allowed no com\nmunication with her daughter, and locked the door and hid the key.\nA dream like this did not, of course, represent things unknown to\nSign\" ilaria and known to others, because the existence of ruins under\nthe Lake of Garda is not demonstrated nor demonstrable. There is a\nlegend to that effect, but Signa Maria may have once known and\nforgotten it. When she was asked if she had read anything about the\nLake of Garda, she replied in the negative, and told me that her scanty\nreading consisted chiefly of translations from French novels, in which\nthe Champs Elysees, etc., and not the Lake of Garda, played a part.\nBut such a declaration is, of course, insufficient to prove that she\nmight not in some way have heard the legend, and this is rendered\n\f264 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\nmore probable by a discovery I made later, that when, in the case\nof Maria, a conscious idea has been telepathically transferred, it\nacquires in consequence a tendency to pass out of the field of conscious\nmemory.\nIt is to be noted that Angelina showed from her description that\nshe had really seen a lake, but she called it a very large canal with\ntrees on its banks ; simply because the idea of a canal was familiar to\nher. Besides, the water was seen of a milky white colour, but this\nperception was not associated with the colour of milk, but with the\ncolour of aniseed and water. This is another fact unfavourable to the\nidea of verbal suggestion.\nExperiment 27.\u2014When Elvira manifested in automatic writing, she\nfirst asked me :\u2014\" Are you pleased with the child's dream 1 Tell me\nthe truth.\" I replied :\u2014\"The dream was amusing to her, but of very\nlittle use to me, because it was about things which I cannot possibly\nverify.\"\nAnswer. \" Leave me to show her something that Maria cannot\npossibly have seen. I see that the child understands me and remembers\nquite well what I say to her. I will tell her in her dream the name of\nthe city, and the name of the exact point she has seen.\"\nI thought it best to accept the proposal, though it was not what I\nwas aiming at, but I asked Elvira to show Angelina a little cart,\nwith a small barrel in it, drawn by a large dog. Elvira accepted the\naddition.\nExperiment 28.\u2014December 23f-C?.\u2014 4 p.m. Angelina had had no\ndream the preceding night, or at least when she woke she did not\nremember it. I was told that she had been restless, probably from\nworms, and this would account for the failure.\nElvira said instead that the dream had not taken place because she\nhad been unable to come, and promised to act the next night.\nDecember 2ith.\u20144 p.m. Signa Maria told me that Angelina had\nrelated the following dream that morning :\u2014\nShe was with the blue child in a place full of stones ; there were\nvery large horses with long thin necks, and some had one hump, and\nsome two. The men wore white cloaks. The road was all up and\ndown hill. She saw a great stone with many holes, and a little cart\ndrawn by a large dog, with a barrel full of wine which was trickling\nout. The blue child had told her at the end of the dream that this\nplace was Cario (i.e., Cairo). I called the child and made her give an.\naccount, which coincided almost perfectly with that of Sig^ Maria.\nShe only left out some small details which she afterwards added in.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 265\nreply to my non-suggestive questions. She added that the men were\nnot all in white cloaks,\u2014some had jackets ; they had also white hats\n(turbans ? )\nSiga Annetta, who, as usual, had heard the child's story directly\nshe woke, confirmed all this.\nIn this case also the ideas might have been easily drawn from the\nmind of Sign\" Maria, who might have acquired them from illustrated\nbooks, pictures, or more likely panoramas, and the control, of course,\nwas not perfectly rigorous. Angelina described the camels as large\nhorses with long thin necks and one or two humps. Such a description\nrenders it probable that she really saw them without knowing what\nthey were. I could not understand what the child meant to describe\nin talking of the large stone with holes.1\nExperiment 29.\u2014In the evening I visited Signa Maria again, and,\nputting myself into communication with Elvira, I proposed a dream of\naerial ascension for the same night ; but first, of course, I asked her if\nshe knew anything about it. Elvira replied (automatic script), \" Yes,\nwe can try that too; I am not used to it, but I know a little, however.\"\nI then explained my dream : Angelina should be with me and with\nthe servant who lived at her own home in Venice, in the enclosure of\nthe Prat\u00a9 della Valle (in Padua). We should all get into the car of a\nballoon and ascend from the middle of the enclosure, descending at\nVenice, on the Rialto bridge. The balloon was to be green.\nDecember 25th. Evening.\u2014Siga Annetta told me that, when I left\nthe evening before, Angelina was already asleep, and that her daughter\nhad gone to bed directly after without seeing the child. Siga Annetta\nhad put the latter to bed without waking her, had locked her into her\nroom and hidden the key. In the morning the child told her dream\nbefore seeing Sign* Maria. Her story was as follows :\u2014\nShe seemed to be with me and the servant from Venice in the Prato\nikl\\a Yatte, where there was a great ball, the colour of salad, furnished\nwith many ropes. We all went up into the air and descended at\nVenice upon the Rialto bridge.\nAfterwards Signa Maria told me that in the morning, as soon as she\nsaw the child, the latter had told her the same story, with the difference\nthat she had said \" the colour of grass \" instead of the colour of salad ;\nand she had added that we had climbed in by the cords.\nIt should be remarked again that the expressions \" colour of grass,\ncolour of salad,\" bear witness for the direct impression of colour\nrather than for verbal impression ; but I need not insist upon this\n1 About nine months later I asked Elvira for an explanation of this. She replied\nthat Angelina had meant to describe certain Egyptian houses.\n\f266 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nfurther in cases of complete success with the blockade, especially as it\nwill be seen that my methods became more and more stringent.\nExperiment 30.\u2014I then proposed to Elvira to carry out a dream she\nhad proposed on December 20th\u2014viz., to make Angelina dream that\nshe was at sea and sea-sick in a storm, and that she heard the orders\nof the captain. She accepted the unexpected proposition. The aim of\nthis dream was, as I have said, to discover if it were possible to induce\nin the child emotions and sensations hitherto entirely unknown to her.\nI asked Elvira, \" Do you know enough of nautical matters, or must I\nhelp you 1 \"\nAnswer. \" No, don't tell me anything ; I know a little.\"\nTo obtain a proof that the dream was a result of impressions\nreceived that night, and in no way prepared beforehand, I asked Elvira\nto add a red flag, with a green cross in the middle, to the boat.\nDecember 26th.\u2014Signor C. Vanzetti and I called on Signa Maria\nabout 3 p.m. Signa Maria was present, but not Angelina, when\nSiga Annetta assured us that she had applied the blockade rigorously\nthe preceding night, so that Signa Maria could not possibly have\ncommunicated with Angelina, whose door had been locked and the key\nhidden. About 4 a.m. Angelina had called for Siga Annetta, who\nwent to see what she wanted. When the child saw her she said,\n\" Grandmother, so bad ! \" ; complained of having been sick, and\npointed to signs of the sickness on the floor, but Siga Annetta could\nsee nothing. Then the child said she had dreamt of being in a very\nlarge boat, with flags above, one of which had a s\u00abZad-coloured cross,\nand that a man with a great beard had said, \" Cut the ropes, cut\ntlie sails.\"\nSig1ni Maria, who, as usual, only heard the child's story later on,\nadded the following particulars :\u2014Angelina had told her that the flag\nwith the salad-coloured cross was red ; that the men had black trousers\nand were in their shirt-sleeves ; that they were all upon a very large\ntramway. It should be noted that at Venice the small steamboats\nwhich carry passengers from one point of the city to another are called\ntramtvays, and thus Angelina, when speaking of great tramways, meant\nsteamboats.\nThe absent child was now called, and repeated the account herself.\nShe said she had been in a steamboat with many men, none of whom\nshe knew. One of them had a long beard. There was a red flag with\na salad-coloured crown. When asked what she meant by crown, she\ntraced a cross with her finger. The confusion of names results from\nthe fact that devotional crowns generally carry a cross hanging from\nthe end. Angelina went on to relate that there was much water,\nwhich even came inside ; and it thundered and lightened besides. The\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 267\nman with the beard said, \" Bend the sail* .' cut the ropes ! \" She said\nher legs ti-embled, that she could not stand, and then was sick.\nWe asked her if the steamboat was like those which go from Padua\nto Venice (i.e., the trains) or like those on the Lagoon. She answered\nthat it was like those on the Lagoon. Sig* Annetta asked her if the\nropes she had talked about in the morning were stretched (horizontally)\nor upright. \"Upright,\" replied the child. Sigt Annetta told us that\nthe child habitually woke early, but never at 4 a.m., which at this\nseason is the middle of the night.\nSetting aside the unseamanlike orders of the captain, which can be\nexplained by Elvira's ignorance of things nautical, this dream is\ninteresting from the fact that a new sensation is implicated in it,\u2014a\nvisceral sensation. The child said she felt so ill ; she must even have\nfelt really sea-sick, as she believed she had vomited ; and this was all\nthe more remarkable as she had never been to sea, and does not come\nof a seafaring family. She was therefore ignorant of the pathological\nresults of the oscillation of the body, and therefore the mere idea\nof going to sea in bad weather was insufficient to set in action a-\npre-existing mechanism of associations based on memory only, and\nproducing the sensation of sea-sickness.\nPart II.\nStudy of Visual Images.\nI now proposed another method of control in order to test the\nhypothesis of verbal suggestion. This was to show Signa Maria while\nElvira was present a previously unseen drawing, representing nothing\nthat she could describe in words, and then ask Elvira to make Angelina\nsee it in a dream. Afterwards I would show Angelina the real drawing,\nmixed with others of the same type [which Signa Maria had not seen],\nto see if she would recognise it after having dreamt of it.\nOn December 25th I asked Elvira, \" If I showed you the design of\nsome architectural ornament chosen at hazard amongst many, could\nyou show it to Angelina in a dream, so that after she awoke she would\nbe able to recognise it amongst many others ? \" Elvira replied (by\nautomatic writing), \" Oh, yes, indeed, it will please me very much to\ndo it.\" Q. \" Even if I used drawings unknown to you and Angelina\nand Maria, such as machines, etc. 1 \" A. \" Yes, yes ; whatever you\nplease.\"\nDecember 26<\/t. Evening.\u2014I took with me Fig. V. of the first\nnumber of Professor Romolo Trevisani's Corso (VOmalo, meaning to\nbegin with something easy. I left the five other pictures which the\n\f268 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nnumber contains at home. As the picture is not mounted for safely\ncarrying in the pocket, I enclosed it between two very stiff pieces of\npaper, so that it should not crease or tear, and thus be distinguishable\nfrom the others, which are quite new.\nHowever, this evening I could make no experiments, because\nAdriano manifested instead of Elvira, and said, in automatic writing,\nthat he could not yet replace Elvira in such experiments.\nDecember 27th. Evening.\u2014The experiment with the drawing had\nto be put off for the same reason as yesterday.\nExperiment 31.\u2014December 28lh. Evening.\u2014Elvira manifested,\nand said she was ready for the experiment. She said, however, that\nshe was much afraid she could not see the drawing without making\nuse of Signa Maria's eyes. Therefore, to prevent the latter from\nlooking at the drawing either more or less than was necessary, I\narranged with Elvira that she should make a sign with Signa Maria's\nhand when she had seen enough, upon which I would cover the\npicture again.\nI then drew from my pocket the picture, which neither SigM\nMaria nor any one else in the house had seen, and put it before her. In\nabout half a minute her hand moved, and I covered the picture and\npocketed it quickly so that no one else should see it. Elvira wrote at\nonce, \" That is enough for me.\"\nWhen I was leaving, I went to the room on the ground floor where\nAngelina had only just awoke from her usual nap on the sofa. She\nwas very tiresome, as she usually is when sleepy. I thought she was\nnot at all in a state to receive any information from Signa Maria about\nthe drawing the latter had seen.\nAs it would be interesting to know if our normal personalities are\nable to induce telepathic dreams in Angelina, as Elvira does, I had\ntried at my house on several nights to suggest some dream to her, but\nhad had no results. Supposing that Signa Maria was in better con\nditions for such action, I begged her, on leaving, to will strongly and\nfrequently during the night, while Angelina was presumably a,sleep,\nthat she should dream she had a hen in her arms. And to induce\nSigna Maria to do her best, I told her that what Elvira did she should\nbe able to do, which aroused her emulation.\nDecember 29th. 7.15 a.m.\u2014Siga Annetta, whom I saw first, told\nme that yesterday evening, with the usual precautions, she had locked\nthe child into her room and hid the key, but that shortly before my\narrival she had heard calls, and knowing that Angelina was not well,\nshe had opened the door, and not having time to stop with her, had\nbeen obliged to carry her to her own bed, where her daughter still was..\nOn going up I found Sig^ Maria still in bed and awake, and Angelina\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 269\nasleep again ; however she soon awoke. Signa Maria assured me that\nduring the short time Angelina had been there, she had not spoken to\nher about the drawing or anything.\nSig\" Annetta then took the child downstairs. I gave her the\npictures, asking her to show them to Angelina and ask her if she had\ndreamt of anything she saw among them. Of the six pictures, three\nrepresented simple or composite leaves, and the other three are large\nroses. Angelina selected Fig. V., saying she was sure she had dreamt\nof that and not of the others.\nI had, however, forgotten to hide the inscription, \" Fig. V.,\" in the\ncorner when I showed the picture to Signa Maria the evening before,\nand although Angelina does not know her alphabet or numbers, this\nmight have offered a point de repere sufficiently describable by words cr\ndrawing.\nAfter the child had found the picture, I went upstairs to Signa\nMaria's room carrying the pamphlet, and\u2014avoiding any indication\u2014\nasked her to find the picture she had seen last evening. To my surprise\nshe rejected Fig. V., and hesitated between the other two roses. I\nshould add that directly after I had shown the rose to Signa Maria the\nevening before, she could not tell me how many leaves it had.\nThis fact, which was repeated constantly during the experiments,\nis probably of great importance in psychology, and particularly in\ntelepathy. Indeed, as may be already seen from this first example, it\nwas not that Signa Maria had forgotten the figure ; on the contrary,\nshe recognised it, but sub-consciously, otherwise she could not have\nrejected it at once ; and besides, she always justifies such an action (as\nwill be seen later) by the most unlikely reasons, exactly as happens,\nwith a subject acting under a hypnotic suggestion intended to alter\nhis judgment. Consequently the telepathic transference of a sensory\nimage to another percipient is to Signa Maria practically the same\nthing as the suggestion that she shall not be able to recognise the\nimage, and thus is the same thing as the disappearance of the image\nfrom hf.r supraliminal consciousness. Naturally we must guard against\nconcluding genera] psychological laws from the psychical idiosyncrasies\nof particular subjects ; but in any case the fact remains that such\nillusions of memory present themselves in some subjects. And if\nit finally becomes recognised that in all telepathic agents there exists\nan inclination more or less strong to present such phenomena, this\nwould make a new point of view from which to explain the frequent\nunconsciousness of the agent in spontaneous telepathy.\nAs to Signa Maria's attempt consciously to suggest a dream, she\ntold me she had tried to do what I told her, both overnight and in the\nmorning when Angelina fell asleep in her bed. But the latter said she\nhad had no other dream, and when a possible dream about a hen was\ny\n\f270 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nmentioned to her, she did not admit the suggestion, but positively\ndenied having had such a dream.\nAfter dinner, when Signor C. Vanzetti was present, Elvira began\nto write automatically, asking at once, \"Are you pleased with me?\"\nI expressed my satisfaction at the success, but asked her if much time\nand pains had been needed to induce the visual image in the little girl.\nShe replied, \" No, on the contrary, it was very easy, only I thought the\nchild had not looked at it enough, and instead it was the grown-up one\n(Maria) who should have been ashamed ; for I was here this morning,\nand I was much amused to see that she chose any but the right (i.e., any\npicture but the right), and she was so sure and so obstinate ! \"\nExperiment 32.\u2014December 31s<. Evening.\u2014Elvira manifested\nthrough automatic writing, and I proposed a new experiment for that\nnight. T had brought J. Carpentier's Illustrated Catalogue of Electrical\nApparatus, Ed. July, 1887, Paris, and had decided to transfer to\nAngelina Fig. 11,\u2014a Weber's galvanometer. To avoid possible verbal\nindications from the number of the figure, or its place, or the number\nof the page, I placed the book (unseen by Signa Maria) on the sideboard,\nopen at the right page, covering up the page with four perfectly opaque\nquires of white paper, so as to show the figure in the smallest possible\nsquare. I then covered the figure with another piece of paper. When\nElvira said she was ready to look, I brought Sign\" Maria close, and\ndirected her glance to the covered figure. I uncovered it quickly, and\nlooked at the time. After 52 seconds Sig1ni Maria said that Elvira had\nmoved her hand to show she had finished. I covered up the figure\nagain at once, and Signa Maria returned to the table. The communica\ntion with Elvira was hardly finished, when I put the pamphlet in my\npocket, so that Signa Maria did not see it again. I determined in future\nto follow the same method, also hiding the initials of the artist if they\nexist, and to avoid as much as possible pictures with letters around\nthem, especially when the letters could easily be utilised for verbal\nindications. In the present case I chose Fig. 11, because it has several\npoints in common with some others among the 34 in the catalogue, such\nas the lower part consisting of a disc on three feet, a vertical rod in\nthe middle, etc., and because it would be very difficult (for anyone not\nfamiliar with such instruments) to distinguish it by means of a verbal\ndescription from Fig. 10, which is also a Weber's galvanometer.1\n1 All the pamphlets containing diagrams used in this and the following experi\nments have been sent tc us by Dr. Ermacora. From a study of these, it seems to as\nclear that it would be extremely difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014for an unscientific\nperson with no knowledge of drawing, who had only seen one of the diagrams m emcA\ncase, either to describe it to another person in such a way as to enable him to pick\nit out of the set, or to reproduce it from memory with sufficient accuracy to enable\nhim to recogniee it.\u2014Ed.\n\fTelepathic Dreams ElcperimenUdly Induced. 271\nElvira, in automatic writing, approved of this evening's methods,\nand without making absolute promises of success, undertook to try.\nI determined that if these experiments in the transference of\npictures should succeed, I would try either the rotation of the picture\nin its own plane, or specular inversion, in order to render verbal trans\nference more difficult. I therefore asked Elvira if she could show the\nchild the picture, not as she herself saw it, but turned through some\ningle, or upside down in its own plane, or symmetrically inverted.\nOf course I explained these terms in detail. She replied, \" I think it\nwill be very easy ; we will try.\"\nJanuary 1st, 1893. 7 a.m.\u2014I found Bigna Maria and Angelina\nalready risen, as the former's sister-in-law was ill. I asked Angelina if\nshe had dreamt of anything ; she said she had dreamt of playing with\na paper with a picture on it. I showed her Carpcntier's catalogue, but\nshe could not find the picture she had dreamt of, nor could she descritle\nthe figure of her dream. She only said it was like a horizontal pole.\nElvira did not manifest this evening.\nJanuary '2nd. Evening.\u2014I asked Elvira the reason of yesterday's\nnon-success, and she replied, in automatic writing, \" It was not the\nchild's fault. Because T tried to make her see the picture from another\nside, as you told me, she did not see it well. It is my fault for doing\nit too soon.\" This explanation is in agreement with Angelina's\nimpression, if we suppose that this \" other side \" of the picture meant\na rotation through 90 deg. in one direction or the other, because in\nthat position the glass tube which encloses the suspension thread\nbecomes a horizontal pole. In that case Angelina, holding the picture\nstraight, would not recognise it.\nExperiment 33.\u2014This evening I took the catalogue of J. Duboscq's\nspectroscopes (Ed. 1876), and chose figure 4 beforehand. (See Plate\nI., Fig. I.) It represents an Amici's spectroscope on a column with\nthree feet, which looks like a table with a central pillar. But two\nother figures out of the eight in the catalogue have this three footed\ncolumn, and this would make verbal description of No. 4 insufficient.\nElvira was ready and pleased to experiment. The precautions\ndescribed above were repeated, and SigDa Maria looked at the picture\nfor 30 seconds. I need not say that nobody in the house had ever seen\nthe catalogue, and that I had shown it to no one beforehand. I must\nhere remark that this was always the case, and that I used a fresh\nbook each time.\nThis evening the conditions were more strict. The child was put to\nbed and the door locked. I sealed a piece of paper over the keyhole\nwith four seals. Of course I left the key with Sig-'i Annetta in case of\nnecessity.\ny 2\n\f272 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\nJanuary 3rd. 6.30 a.m.\u2014Siga Annetta was up, and said she had\nbeen obliged to open the door, as Angelina wanted something, but that\nshe was asleep again. Signa Maria was still in bed in the other room,\nand her mother assured me she had had no communication with the\nchild. Angelina woke and called Siga Annetta to dress her. I gave Sig*\nAnnetta the Duboscq's catalogue to show to Angelina, and remained\nin Signa Maria's room. Siga Annetta then came to say that Angelina\nhad dreamt of playing with a paper on which was a picture, and that\non looking at the catalogue she recognised the picture, which she said\nwas like a table. As there are two spectroscopes of Kirchoff and\nBunsen in the book which are much more like tables, T told\nSiga Annetta to warn Angelina to be sure which she had seen, or she\nwould not have her usual reward,\u2014a sweetmeat. Siga Annetta\nreturned, and showed me Fig. 4, saying the child was sure that was it.\nThus the success was complete. I gave the book to Signa Maria to\nidentify the figure she had seen yesterday, but she rejected Fig. 4 and\nchose Fig. 3, a spectroscope of Kirchoff and Bunsen, very unlike the\nother. When asked her reason, she said that she had not chosen\nFig. 4 because the one she had seen had not that long piece (the body\nof the spectroscope in Fig. 4), and that there were no little separate\npictures (sections of the prisms). Thus, Maria forgets precisely\nthose characteristics which are the most striking in the figure seen the\nevening before.\nTwo days after, Signa Maria told me she had asked Angelina to\nrelate her dream, and that the child had said she would not talk about\nit any more ; that she had given the picture she had played with back\nto Uncle Giovanni (as she calls me), and that it was all done with.\nThis shows how vivid Angelina's dreams must be, since she confounds\nthem with objective events.\nElvira did not manifest in the evening. I charged Signa Maria to\nmake Angelina dream of a vine loaded with ripe black grapes, and of\neating them.\nJanuary 1th. Evening.\u2014Sign6 Maria told me she had tried hard\nand' often during the night to suggest the proposed dream to\nAngelina, but that when she was asked about it, she replied that she\nhad dreamt of playing with other children outside the door, and when\nasked if she had eaten any fruit in her dream, she said, no.\nExperiment 34.\u2014That evening I had taken with me No. 19 of the\nRevue Genirale des Sciences, October 15th, 1892, and had chosen for\nexperiment Fig. 16, p. 668. (See Plate I., Fig. II.) This was a rather\ndaring choice, because out of the 18 figures in the book, 9 were of the\nsame type and none were easily describable in words. The 9 pictures\nare reproductions of photographs by C. V. Boys, representing projectiles\n\fTelepathic Dreams Expertmentally Induced. 273\nin motion. All have a grey background, a more or less formless block\nspot (the projectile), curves representing the waves of displacement of\nthe air, and irregular lines representing the electric conductors used to\nproduce the illuminating spark. Two others, besides the selected\nfigure, have a thick vertical line representing the surface of a plate of\nglass traversed by the projectile, and in the other five, as in the chosen\npicture, the outline of the projectile is partly hidden in a sort of fog.\nFig. 16, which I selected, has no very special characteristics ; it is\nhowever the smallest.\nAs it was probable that Angelina's room would be opened again the\nfollowing night, I proposed that a neighbour should sleep with her to\nattend to her, if Elvira approved. The two would naturally be locked\nup together. When the picture had been placed as usual and com-\nmnnication with Elvira established, I asked her if she was disposed for\na new experiment. She replied, \" Yes ; but no promises \" (of success).\nDr. E. \" Would it disturb you if Nannella slept with Angelina to\navoid the opening of the door ? \"\nElv. \"Is she big or little?\"\nDr. E. \"She is 14. She is downstairs. Perhaps you can go and\nlook at her and see if her presence will suit you.\"\nElv. (after a pause) \" Well, do it, but on one condition ; that she\ndoes not disturb the child. We can try, but I cannot understand\neverything by just looking at her.\"\nSigna Maria then looked at the picture for 18 seconds, with the\nusual precautions The time seemed short, and I asked Elvira,\n\" Did you see well ? \" She replied (by automatic writing), \" Yes, very\nwelL\"\nI put the book in my pocket, and, allowing no communication\nbetween Sign* Maria and Angelina, proceeded to blockade the latter\nand Nannella. When they were in bed and quiet, Siga Annetta\nlocked the door, and I examined it and sealed paper over the lock as\nbefore. I had written a sentence on the paper, and of course carried\naway my seal.\nJanuary 5th. 6.45 a.m.\u2014Found Siga Annetta up, all the others in\nbed. Siga Annetta said she had heard the child, but had not opened\nthe door. I went up and carefully examined the form and position of\nthe seals, which I recognised as those I had made. I told Siga Annetta\nto open, while I went to wait in her daughter's room, who was awake.\nI waited till the neighbour had gone, as I wished her to knew nothing\nof the experiments. Then I bade Siga Annetta ask the child simply\n'hat she had dreamt. She said, \" Of playing with pieces of paper.\"\nSig\" Annetta then took the Revue to her, and I waited. I heard that\nAngelina was cross and noisy, and had small hope. Soon after,\nSig\" Annetta came back with the book open at page 668, and showed\nI\n\f274 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nme a figure which Angelina said she had dreamt of. It was Fig. 16,\nand Angelina had said that was the one, because it had a little snake\nin it (the curved conductor).\nThe word snake has a close verbal association with this figure, but\nany one who discovers in this a sign of verbal suggestion should\nnotice, first, that nine of the figures in the book have one or more\ncurved lines, and secondly that Fig. 16 is not the one that most recalls\na snake; Fig. 14 does so much more. The real point of difference\nbetween Fig. 16 and the others, i.e., its smallness, would have served\nSigna Maria much better for verbal suggestion. And besides, how could\nverbal suggestion have taken place 1 Signa Maria would have been\nobliged to shout a description of the figure outside Angelina's closed\ndoor. Now no hypnotist will believe that a child of four years, in\nnatural sleep, could be made to distinguish Fig. 16 from the others by\nsuch means. Or can any one believe that such an exact idea could\nbe conveyed to a child awakened in the night, when she would\nnaturally be sleepy and cross 1 And then, why should her companion\nand Siga Annetta in the next room have heard nothing 1 It may be\nsaid that SigIla Maria reproduced the drawing, unconsciously or not,\nand passed it beneath the door. But Signa Maria cannot draw,\nautomatically or otherwise. How could a child, ignorant that she\nwas being experimented upon, have eluded her companion, got a light,\nand studied the drawing given her by such means 1 I believe all this\nnot only impossible for Signa Maria in somnambulism, but also if she\nhad consciously and artfully used her senses. I will not raise the idle\nquestion of the good faith of the persons concerned, for which I can\nanswer, but it seems to me that the conditions stated put fraud out of\nthe question. Naturally, I do not base conclusions on one success ;\nmy experiments were carried further, as will be seen.\nFrom Signa Maria's position she could not see what picture her\nmother had pointed out to me. I gave her the closed book, that she\nmight find the picture she had seen last evening. After some hesita\ntion, she thought she recognised Fig. 15, but was not sure, because\nthey were all so much alike and she only remembered the dusky\noolour. As Fig. 15 was 103mm by 135mm, while Fig. 16 was only\n5gmm \\yy 91mm; j asked her if last night's picture was not smaller.\nShe said she thought it was, but that she might not have seen all of\nit ; part might have been hidden.\nRotation of Figures.\nExperiment 35.\u2014January 5th. 3 p.m.\u2014I took a number of the\nRevue Generale des Sciences, dated March 30th, 1892 (No. 6), to Sig,l*\nMaria.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 275\nI placed Fig. 11, p. 206, in the usual way for Sign* Maria, but,\nwithout her knowledge, turned it upside down. It represented a section\nof a pump for spraying antiseptic liquids, and would be meaningless to\nany one unacquainted with machines (see Plate I., Fig. III). The\nnumber contains 26 figures, most of them very unlike Fig. 11.\nThere are only three others representing sections of disinfecting\napparatus, which, however, do not resemble Fig. 11.\nWhen communication with Elvira was established (automatic\nwriting), she said, \" Tell me only what you want for to-night, because\nI cannot stop so long as I did yesterday.\"\nI showed her the picture as usual for 17 seconds, and then the con\nversation continued.\nDr. E \" I should like you to show Angelina the picture turned\nhalf-way round in its own plane ; that is, upside down.\"\nElv. \" I will not promise, but will try.\"\nDr. E. \" Did Nannella's presence interfere with the success ? \"\nElv. \"For my part, she does not disturb me at all.\"\nJanuary Qlh. 7.30 a.m.\u2014As the picture had been looked at in\nthe afternoon, I had been unable to lock up Angelina at night. Signa\nMaria and her mother had risen when I arrived. The child had left\nher own room a little before, and was in Signa Maria's bed. I\nremained in the latter's room while Siga Annetta carried off the child\nto dress her. Before leaving the room she said she had dreamt of\nplaying with papers. I asked her if there were pictures on them, and\nshe said, yes. Angelina was carried to her own bed, and I sent her\nthe book. Soon after, Siga Annetta came back to say that Angelina\nwas puzzled and had put the book into disorder (it had come unsewn).\nIn a short time she returned, and giving me the book upside down,\npointed to Fig. 11, and said that Angelina had recognised it decidedly\nand at once, exclaiming, \" That's it.\" Yesterday I had shown the\npicture to Elvira reversed, but had asked her to show it to Angelina\nupside down in relation to the position in which Elvira had seen it\u2014\nthat is to say, right side up. Now, as AngeUna had been obliged to\nput the book into confusion to find the picture, and Siga Annetta had\ngiven it to me upside down, it seemed that a vision of the figure\nupside down had been produced. I kept Signa Maria as usual in igno\nrance of the figure Angelina had indicated, and gave her the closed\nbook that she might search for herself. After a short examination of\nthe book right side up, she chose the right half of Fig. 5, which half\nis the very picture least unlike the one she had seen the day be\/ore. I\ntold her she was wrong, and that she must turn the book upside down.\nBut she persisted in choosing the same half of Fig. 5. I did not con\ntinue to tell her she was wrong, and decided not to do so in future, for\nfear of interfering with results.\n\f276 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nAbout 4 p.m. I want back to Sig'la Maria, and put myself into\ncommunication with Elvira.\nElv. ' ' Tell me if you are content.\"\nDr. E. \" Yes, I am pleased, although last night the conditions were\nnot strict enough. Have you any observation to make about the\nexperiment 1 \" (Alluding to the failure, as I supposed, in turning the\npicture.)\nElv. \" I made her see it right side up, as you told me she ought to\nsee it turned.\"\nDr. E. \" Explain how you knew that the picture you saw yesterday\nevening was upside down.\"\nElv. \" Who is talking of yesterday evening 1 I knew it this\nmorning when I was present while the child was searching.\"\nDr. E. \" But since you saw Angelina examining the book, you must\nhave seen that it was upside down, so that the turning did not take\nplace in the dream.\"\nElv. \"But what are you driving at? The child looked for it this\nmorning with the book right side up ; I know that. When Angelina\ngave the book to her grandmother, it was by its proper side.\"\nNow, from Elvira's coherent explanation, it will be seen that she\nmaintains that the figure she saw yesterday was shown right side\nup in the dream, and that, in spite of appearances to the contrary,\nAngelina found it with the volume right side up. Siga Annetta was\nabsent, so I could not ask her on which side Angelina had recognised\nthe figure ; but I called the latter from the ground floor, where she\ncould not have overheard the preceding dialogue, and asked her to find\nthe picture she had seen in her dream again, putting the book right\nside up before her. Of course I took care that Sign\" Maria should not\nbe able to influence her involuntarily. I turned over the pages, and\nbefore reaching the right one, she showed me with her finger that the\npicture was at the top and to the left [which is correct]. When she\nreached p. 206, she pointed out Fig. 11 at once without hesitation.\nNot content with this, I turned the book upside down, and asked her\nif by chance she had seen it in this position, but in spite of the\nsuggestive question, she gave a decided No. As the figure is in a\ncorner, it is inadmissible that Angelina should have been mistaken\nafter her prompt and spontaneous declaration.\nNext morning I took back the book and asked Siga Annetta to\nshow me again, if she remembered, the picture Angelina had chosen\nthe previous morning. I held the book right side up, and turned the\npages ; at p. 206 she showed me Fig. 11. I also asked her if the child\nhad not selected the picture with the book upside down, but she said,\nNo. Thus it is plain that Elvira was right.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 277\nExperiment 36. \u2014 On January 6th I showed Elvira, for a fresh\ndream, Fig. 3, p. 269, of the Revue Generale det Sciences for April\n30th, 1892 (No. 8). It has 14 pictures, but 4 only are of the same\ntype as Fig. 3, which represents Carpentier's declinometer. The other\n3 which are like it represent magnetic instruments, all with tripods,\nwhich would suggest tables to non-scientific persons, and Fig. 1 has\nalso a vertical tube like Fig. 3.1 The usual precautions were taken,\nand Elvira looked at the figure upside down for 35 seconds. Unfor\ntunately, this figure was lettered, which may have shown SigM Maria\nthat it was upside down.\nJamiary 7th. 7.30 a.m.\u2014Angelina told Sign Annetta that she\nhad no dream.\nExperiment 37. Evening.\u2014I asked Elvira if she had anything\nto say. She replied (automatic writing), \" Yes ; excuse me for having\ntailed last night ; it was not the difficulty, but because I could not\ncome. If you like, we will have the same figure again ; if not,\nchange it.\"\n1 agreed to Elvira's proposal, wishing to see if she would remember\nthe picture after 24 hours. I asked her again to turn it upside\ndown.\nIn order to prevent future confusion in counting successes and\nfailures, I asked Elvira to tell me in automatic writing, when I came\nto verify results, if she had tried to act or not ;\u2014of course before any one\nquestioned the child. For evidently if, before I broke the blockade,\nElvira wrote, \" To-night I could not act,\" this might be counted, not as\na failure, but as an experiment not carried out. Elvira accepted my\nproposal.\nJanuary 8th. 7.45 a.m.\u2014Yesterday Angelina's sister and a servant\nhad arrived from Venice, and Angelina's room had been given to\nthem, so that she had slept with Sigin1 Maria and her mother. I\nfound the two girls in bed, but awake. Signa Maria told me that\nAngelina had already said she had dreamt, but that she would only\ntell her dream to her grandmother. Sig* Annetta carried her out of\nthe room, and after an interval returned and told me that the child\nhad dreamt of the usual papers. She took the closed number of the\nRente dss Sciences to the child, and I told her to make Angelina look\nat the pictures from all sides, and to bring back the book exactly in\nthe position the child pointed out. After a few moments, she brought\nback the book open at p. 269, and showed me Fig. 3 right side up.\nConsequently Angelina must have dreamt of the figure seen by\n1 Perhaps the most conspicuous feature in this diagram is that the tube is opened\nto show the internal mechanism, so that it might be described as a round cupboard\nwith anopen door. No other figures in the book have this feature.\u2014Ed.\n\f278 Dr. 0. B. Ermacora.\nElvira the evening before last, and have dreamt of it right side upr\nwhich was intended.1\nExperiment 38.\u2014In the evening, I had chosen and prepared in\nthe usual way Fig. 11, p. 40, of the Lumiere Electrique for\nJanuary 13th, 1883, representing a vertical section of a turbine,\nwithout letters or figures. The number contained twenty-six figures\nor groups of figures. Two of them represent landscapes, and must not\nbe counted. The others are chiefly sections of scientific instruments,\nvery unlike No. 11 for any one who can compare them, while Figs. 7,\n13, and 17, which also represent vertical sections of turbines, are\nsufficiently like No. 11 to prevent Signa Maria from describing the\nlatter to Angelina in terms which would enable the child to distin\nguish it from them. And her powers of drawing, either in a conscious\nor an automatic state, are too low to allow of her making a sketch of\nit from memory. Elvira looked at the picture for 28 seconds, and\nwas requested to turn it. She replied, \" I understand, and I hope\nthere will be no difficulty.\"\nJanuary 9th. 7.45 a.m.\u2014Signa Maria slept with Angelina and the\nservant this night. They were in bed when I arrived. Signa Maria\nand the servant assured me that they had not talked about dreams\nsince waking. Angelina was carried off as usual, and Elvira wrote,\n\" I have not tried, because the child was too excited. I will try\nto night without fail.\"\nAngelina's father had arrived the evening before and wished to\ntake her back with him, which had greatly vexed her, on account of\nher love for Sigmi Maria, and though he had yielded to me and agreed\nto leave her, she was still alarmed.\nI went downstairs, and Angelina told me at once that she had hat!\nno dream ; she had previously told Sig* Annetta the same thing.\nIn the evening Signa Maria was not well, and we had no com\nmunication with Elvira.\nJanuary 10th. 7A5 a.m.\u2014Sign\" Maria and Angelina were still in\nbed, where they had slept together. Angelina told me she had a\ndream to relate, but would only tell it to her grandmother. She\nwas carried off, and Elvira wrote, \" I have not been able to do\nanything.\"\nSiga Annetta came back to say that Angelina had dreamt of\nplaying with her sister Enrichetta. This dream was natural after the\nsister's visit, but the case shows that Elvira's predictions of success or\nnon-success were dependable.\n1 It may be noted that Angelina found the figure the first time she looked for it ;\nbut see note on p. 277.\u2014Ed.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 279\nExperiment 39.\u2014In the evening, I showed Elvira the same picture\nagain. This time it was turned 90 deg. in the opposite direction to\nthe hands of a clock, consequently on its side, instead of in the position\nof the day before yesterday. This transforms it into quite another\nfigure for Sign* Maria. The observation lasted 1 7 seconds, and I then\ncharged Elvira to turn it 90 deg. more in the opposite direction to the\nclock hands. This rotation of the sensorial image, added to the\nrotation already really made, should have made Angelina drenm of it\nupside down.\nJanuary llth. 6.45 a.m.\u2014I found only Biga Annetta risen. Her\ndaughter and the child were awake, but in their respective rooms.\nSign* Maria said she had not yet spoken to Angelina. Later on in the\nevening, Sig* Annetta told me she had locked Angelina alone into her\nroom immediately after I had gone, and that she had only opened the\ndoor a quarter of an hour before my coming. In the meantime\nAngelina had not left her bed, nor spoken of dreams. While Signa\nMaria was still in bed, we communicated with Elvira, who wrote\nautomatically, \" I have tried, and hope I have succeeded.\"\nI gave the book to Sig1 Annetta, warning her that Angelina might\nnot find the picture with the book right side up, but might be obliged\nto turn it. I gave no indication as to the direction or degree of the\nrotation. She soon returned and showed me the figure in the position\nin which the child had recognised it. It was Fig. 11, p. 40, but\nupside down, not as had been pre-arranged, but from Elvira's point of\nview of yesterday. Siga Annetta assured me that the child had\nrecognised it thus, and again in the evening she added that Angelina\nhad turned the book spontaneously, Siga Annetta having said nothing\nabout my instructions. Signa Maria was unable from her place to see\nthe picture pointed out by her mother or the position of the lxlok, and I\ngave it to her closed, warning her to look at the pictures from all sides.\nShe said at once that she recognised Fig. 7, p. 309, as the picture she\nhad seen. She was holding it turned 90 deg. in the contrary direction\nto the hands of the clock. This was the position of yesterday, and\nFig. 7 is the most like Fig. 11 in this position ; therefore this first\njudgment follows the law I have pointed out of the substitution of\nanother idea wilh the least possible error.\nI asked Angelina if she had recognised the picture by any par\nticular sign, or by its whole. As far as I could judge, she had recog\nnised the whole.\nOn the following evening (January 12th) I asked Elvira, \"How\ndo you know if you have made Angelina dream or not 1 \" She\nreplied, \" I know from the child's more or less quiet sleep. If she\nmoves a little afterwards, the result is doubtful ; if she is quiet, I\nam sure,\"\n\f280 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nFor various reasons, no more experiments of this kind were made\nuntil March 1st. I tried meanwhile to utilise the time in new experi\nments in transferring telepathic dreams by Sig,,a Maria's voluntary\nefforts. But after repeated trials I was forced to acquiesce in failure.\nThe total number of such experiments, including those of December\n28th and 29th, 1892, and of January 3rd and 4th, 1893, is 14. Of\nthese, 10 were suggested while the agent and supposed percipient were\nin the same bed. On one other occasion the agent went close to the\npercipient's bed ; it is not stated in my notes if she did so on the three\nremaining occasions. All tlie dreams which she tried to suggest were\nof ideas familiar to the child. As there was only one very doubtful\nand partial success (a vision of Signor Vanzetti) among 1 4 attempts,\nit appears that,\u2014admitting the possibility that Sign* Maria's normal\npersonality might produce telepathic dreams in Angelina,\u2014we may\nyet regard this personality as absolutely unfit for such an office (at\nleast during this period) in comparison with Elvira. Moreover, the\nfact that on one occasion (February 1 lth-1 2th) Signa Maria enforced\nher mental suggestion by humming the music to the child,\u2014without\nsucceeding any more than in the other cases,\u2014shows that the latter\ndoes not possess the great sensorial suggestibility which would have\nbeen necessary if Elvira had produced the dream by such means. This\nis, therefore, another argument in favour of the telepathic explanation.\nIt may be objected that Sign2- Maria's conviction that only Elvira\ncould succeed may have been the cause of her failures. But the\noontrary was the case, as I had explained to Signa Maria that\nthe thing could be done, and that she ought not to show herself\ninferior to Elvira. I do not know how these assertions were received\nby Signa Maria's subliminal consciousness, and it is idle to discuss\nthe point, but the personality of Maria accepted them as reasonable,\nand acted with zeal and the hope of success. Otherwise she would not\nhave risen\u2014as she once did\u2014half-dressed in the cold to enforce her\nsuggestions.\nExperiment 40. \u2014March 1st. 4 p.m.\u2014I chose Fig. 3 of the\nEleclricien (October 29th, 1892) for this night's dream. It is\nwithout letters, and represents a complicated machine used in the\nmanufacture of submarine cables. There are six figures in the\nnumber, without reckoning advertisements on coloured paper. Two\nof these are absolutely unlike Fig. 3 ; three others represent machines\nof the same kind as it. The distinguishing characteristics of Fig. 3\nfor an ignorant person would be its numerous toothed and untoothed\nwheels, also some discs with pegs perpendicular to their planes ; [but\nthese features are also found in all the other three similar figures.]\nMy choice of the two positions of the figure, at the time of observation\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 2b1\nand in the dream, was made by lot. I distinguish four positions\ncorresponding to the four sides of the volume. No. 1 is the proper\nposition for reading, No. 2 with the book on its right side, No. 3 upside-\ndown, and No. 4 with its left side to the observer. I threw the dice,\nand position No. 2 turned up. The picture was arranged in the usual\nvaj. During the communication with Elvira, Signa Maria looked at\nthe figure for 25 seconds. Position 1 was chosen by lot for the dream.\nThis would bring the book right side up, but not the figure, which\nwas placed lengthwise down the page.\nMarch 2nd. 9 a.m.\u2014Sign\" Maria said she had not yet asked the\nchild about the dream. Before questioning her we communicated\nwith Elvira, who wrote, \" I have tried, and hope I have succeeded ;\nhut if not, do not be too tired to try again.\"\nAngelina, interrogated in another room by Siga Annetta, said she\nhad dreamt of holding a book with a picture. I sent the number of\nthe Eltclricien to her, telling her to look at the pictures from all sides.\nSig5 Annetta returned with the book open at p. 290, Fig. 3, and said\nthat the child had recognised the little pot. When Angelina was\nmade to seek again in my presence, she again chose Fig. 3, in\nPosition 1, and said she had really seen it so. Siga Annetta also\nassured me the child had found it thus, and only thus do the parts\nshe called a little jwt resemble one. Therefore my programme had\nbeen carried out.\nThis time Sig1ni Maria was placet! so that it was just possible she\nmight have seen the picture her mother pointed out. However, she\nbelieved she recognised Fig. 2 in Position 1 [the one most like Fig. 3].\nAs Angelina had said she knew the picture again from the little pot\n(an insignificant detail) T showed the pot to Signa Maria, asking her if\nshe had seen it in yesterday's picture. She said she did not remember\nit at all. This case leads me to suspect that I may be right in suppos-\nlng that the points most impressed upon the percipient are exactly\nthose which most easily disappear from the consciousness of the agent,\nor perhaps never enter it.\nNo control or blockade had been possible in this last experiment.\nAngelina had slept in her own room, but at 4 a.m. had waked and\ncalled, so that Siga Annetta and Sig\"a Maria had taken her into their\nLed.1\nExjKriment 41.\u20144 p.m. (about).\u2014This time I had chosen the picture\nof a microscopic preparation, looking like a mere scrawl (Fig. 10, p. 634,\nr,f the Revue Generate dee Sciences, for September 30th, 1892). There\nare twelve pictures in the number, all of microscopic preparations,\n1 The figure used in this experiment is so extremely complicated that it is\nspecially difficult to believe that any verbal description of it could have sufficed for\nrecognition.\u2014Ed.\n\f282 Dr G. B. Ermacora.\nand all more or less like irregular blotches. Fig. 2 is much like 10,\nboth having marble-like markings on a spotted ground.\nI chose Position 2 by lot. The picture was placed as usual, and\nthe engraver's name (appearing on the margin of Figs. 2 and 8 also)\nwas carefully hidden. Elvira looked at it for 30 seconds. I then, by\nmeans of the dice, selected position 1 for the dream.\nMarch 3rd. 8.30 a.m. \u2014Everybody was up. I had not been able\nto lock up Angelina, and she had left her bed in the night to go to\n8igna Maria's. The latter had not yet asked the child about her\ndream. Elvira wrote, \" I have tried, and hope I have succeeded.\"\nSiga Annetta then questioned the child, who said she had dreamt of\na book with a picture, but not like the last. The book was taken\nto her on the ground-floor, and when Sig\" Annetta called me I found\nher with it before her in position 2. She pointed out Fig. 10. I\nasked her if she had seen it in this position. She said first \" No,\" and\nthen \" Yes.\" It is natural to think, however, that she had seen the\nfigure in the position in which she held it, and that therefore the\nrotation of 90 deg. had been effected. I asked her how she recognised\nthe figure, but she was already confused by my previous question, and\npointed to its extreme left, where there was nothing particular.\nI carried the book to Signa Maria, who had remained upstairs.\nAfter examination she rejected the most unlike figures. Then holding\nthe book in Position 2, as it had been during the observation, she\nhesitated between Figs. 2 and 10 ; but finally chose Fig. 2.\nMarch ith.\u2014I went to Signa Maria's house, but forgot to take a\nbook. As I know that the child has a tolerably good ear for music, I\nsuggested to Elvira to make Angelina dream of a musical phrase. She\nreplied, \" We must first have done with the figure dreams, or the child\nwill be confused and I shall have more difficulty in returning to them.\"\nThis advice, not to mix impressions of diverse kinds, should be\nnoted by students of experimental telepathy.\nExperiment 42.\u2014March 5th. Evening.\u2014I selected Fig. 19, p. 41 1,\nof the I.umiere Electriquc for June 14th, 1884, for this night's dream. It\nhas minute letters and numbers, but so have many of the others in the\nbook. Fig. 19 is a diagram of an electric light station, and includes\nbesides the dynamo a number of accessory pieces of apparatus. It is\non a small scale, which makes it still more complicated and confused.\nOf the 37 pictures in the book, 19 are of the same type,\u2014 diagram*\ndrawn in black lines on a white ground, without shading, and having\nminute details marked by letters and figures.\nI put the picture into position 4, taking care to hide its upper\nportion, which represents a circuit, with lamps depending from it, and\nlooks like a ladder, so that it could be easily described.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 283\nThe observation lasted 65 seconds. I asked Elvira to make\nAngelina see it in Position 1.\nBefore leaving, and without Signa Maria's having been able to com\nmunicate with the child (she went downstairs for an instant to fetch\nsomething, but Angelina was asleep), I locked her into the little room,\nsealing a piece of paper by one end to the door near the handle, and by\nthe other to the doorpost. The piece of paper was half of a larger\npiece, on which I had written. It was cut across the words. This\nwas to prevent the paper being changed, and I took the other half\nhome. I had left my seal at home, and used one belonging to Sign*\nMaria, which, of course, I took away with me. I took notes of the\nposition, form, and colour of the drops of sealing-wax. Naturally, if\nthere had been any suspicion of fraud, these precautions would have\nbeen illusory, because Signa Maria could have described the figure\nthrough door or window, or have passed a picture'out through chinks\nor window. But as in this case there could be no fear of fraud,\nbut only of possible somnambulic action, this locking up was of\ngreat importance, since it made such action impracticable. In fact, if\nSigna Maria had tried to describe the figure under the conditions\nmentioned, the only effect would have been to alarm her mother, and to\nmake her inform me that her daughter had gone mad.\nWhen I left that evening, Angelina was still asleep on the sofa.\n8iga Annetta and another person present told me that she had been\nasleep when Signa Maria had come down for a moment, and that the\nlatter had said nothing about dreams.\nMarch 6th. 8 a.m.\u2014From the street I saw Signa Maria waiting to\nbe liberated, and Angelina was at the door. Siga Annetta said that\nthey had not exchanged a word. I found the seals1 in every minutest\ndetail identical with those made the evening before ; the paper was a\nlittle stretched. But I remembered having dried the writing at a\npetroleum lamp. This must have shrunk the paper, and the dampness\nof the night had restored its original length. The two halves corres\nponded.\nAfter letting Signa Maria out, I asked Elvira if she had acted, and\nif she hoped for success. She wrote, \" I have tried, and hope I have\nsucceeded.\" Then Siga Annetta went as usual to question Angelina\non the ground floor, and returned saying the child had had the usual\ndream about a piece of paper with a picture on it. I sent her the\nbook to search, and she soon sent word she had found the picture. I\nfound her with the book in Position 1, and she showed me Fig. 19,2\n1 Every evening after fixing the seals, I write a very minute description of them,\nto assist my recollection.\n2 The figure is an extremely complicated one.\u2014Ed.\n\f284 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nso that she had seen the right figure turned as proposed. Then I took\nthe book to Big\"* Maria. She hesitated between Fig. 20 and Fig. 23.\nAs usual, the figures mistakenly recognised are those which most.\nnearly resemble the right one.\nExperiment 43.\u2014T took the number of La I.umiere Electrique for\nApril 4th, 1885, with me when I went back in the evening. The\nfigure I had chosen was No. 13, p. 16. The book contains 45\nfigures, of which 12 are of the same type and about the same size as.\nNo. 13; they are diagrams of electrical apparatus in black lines on &\nwhite ground. Eight of them, including Fig. 13, are very much alike.\nThey are diagrams of an Edison dynamo with circuits and accessory\napparatus. Figs. 12, 13, and 14 only differ from one another by very\nsmall details. Fig. 13 is lettered, but so are 12 and 14, in analogous,\nparts.\nWith the dice I chose Position 4 for the figure. When Elvira had\ncommunicated, Signa Maria looked at it for 40 seconds with one eye only.\nPosition 2 was selected by means of the dice for the dream, so I asked\nElvira to turn the picture upside down. I told her to make Angelina\nsee it well, as it was to be distinguished from others much like it.\nBefore going to bed, Signa Maria went downstairs twice to fetch\nsomething, but I accompanied her on both occasions to see that she had\nno communication with the others. The child was asleep, and Signa\nMaria uttered no word and made no gesture relative to the experi\nments. I then sealed her up in her room as I had done on the previous\nevening.\nMarch 1th. 7.40 a.m.\u2014Angelina was up and at the front door.\nSiga Annetta said she had waked half an hour ago, that Signa Maria\nhad not yet risen, and that no communication between them had been\npossible. I went up and examined the seals, which were intact ; the\npieces of paper corresponded exactly. Signa Maria was still asleep. I\nwoke her, and she said her head had ached during the night, and did\nso still.\nI gave her the writing-book and pencil, and Elvira wrote directly,\n\" I have tried and have good hope, but excuse me if there is no\nsuccess.\"\nSiga Annetta now came to say that the child had dreamt of play\ning with many papers. The book was taken to her by Sig* Annetta\nas usual, and I stayed upstairs. Soon after, Siga Annetta called me\nand showed me Fig. 13 (see Plate II. Fig. IV.), which Angelina had\nchosen. But the rotation had not been effected ; the picture was in\nPosition 1 instead of 2, and the child said she had seen it so.\nSigna Maria then looked at the book in Position 4., as Elvira had\nseen it the previous evening, and standing behind her T saw ihat when\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 285\nshe came to p. 16, she looked fixedly at Figs. 13 and 14 ; she passed\nthem over in the hope of perhaps finding something better, but went\nback and chose Fig 14 (see Plate II., Fig. V.) When asked why she\npreferred 14 to 13, she said she recognised Fig. 14 by two small rods\n(the two limbs of the field magnets of the dynamo). Besides, Fig. 1 3\nwas excluded on account of the lines being diagonal, and because the\nnpper arc (in Position 4) had swellings (the spirals representing the\nresistance diagrammatically), which she had not seen yesterday. Again,\nthe figure seemed taller (regarding it in Position 4). However, she\nconfessed that during yesterday's observation, she had not remarked\nthe arcs at the top of Fig. 14 (Position 4). She did not remember\nhaving seen letters or numbers.\nSpecular Inversion of Figures.\nExperiment 44.\u2014March 8lh. 6 p.m.\u2014It seemed to me that success\nwith simple rotation of the figures was sufficiently established, and\nthat I might now try specular inversion. I thought of using some\nfignre symmetrical on either side of its axis, making Sign* Maria look\nat one half only, while the other half should be shown in the dreanu\nand recognised by the child. I therefore took with me Vol. II. of\nProfessor Romolo Trevisani's Corso cTOrnato, which contains five-\nornamental designs very nearly symmetrical. These I had cut into\nsymmetrical halves, making ten pieces, and the left half of Fig. IX was\nchosen for observation. I showed the figure to Signa Maria with the\ninscription Fig. IX. directly before her in the left-hand upper corner\nof the paper. I did this expressly to see if the inscription would be\nused as a point de repere. Signa Maria looked at the picture for 40\nseconds, and I asked Elvira to execute a specular inversion of it.\nMarch 9<\/t. 8.30 a.m.\u2014I first asked Elvira if she had acted. She-\nreplied (automatic writing), \"Yes, I have tried, and hope I have\nsucceeded.\" [Angelina, however, could not find the right . picture,\nthough the one she chose resembled it more than any of the others,\nand had Fig. XI. engraved in the corner instead of Fig. IX.]\nIt is to be noted that if the specular image of the observed\npicture was seen in the dream, the Fig. IX. must also have been\ninverted ; and if it attracted the child's attention, she must necessarily\nhave rejected the other half of Fig. IX. because this sign was missing\nfrom it, and have preferred the half bearing the inscription Fig. XI.\nbecause it was the most like the dream picture [of all those that bore\nnumbers].\nExperiment 45. March 10th.\u2014I had chosen Fig. 2, p. 387, of the\nLumiert Electrique, for September 6th, 1884, for this day's experiment,\nz\n\f286 Dr. 0. B. Ermaeora.\n[representing an elaborate apparatus for electric lighting.] Its two\nhalves were almost symmetrical on each side of a central vertical axis,\nand I intended to show one half to Signa Maria, covering the other\nwith the usual folds of paper, to see if, after Elvira had inverted the\nfigure, the child would recognise the other half as her dream picture.\n[The result of this experiment was doubtful : the figure selected was\nnot the right one, but was more like it than any other figure in the\nbook.]\nExperiment 46. March Wth.\u2014About 4 p m., I went back to\nSigna Maria with the picture for the next experiment. I had planned\nto make Elvira see the picture inverted in a mirror, and that she\nshould invert it again in the dream, so that the child might see it in\nits original position. A screen was to be used, to prevent Signa Maria\nfirst seeing the picture directly, and she was to look at it with one eye\nthrough a hole in the screen. She was already accustomed to use one\neye only in these experiments (see ante, p. 284), and the change had\ncaused no new difficulty.\nThe picture I had selected was a group formed of Figs. 30 and 31,\np. 221, of the Lumiere Electrique, for August 9th, 1884 (see Plate II.,\nFig. VI.) The number contains 39 figures, or groups of figures forming\na whole. The figure chosen was a section of a gas-burner for soldering\nelectric lamps ; there were a few small letters on it, and the words air\nand gaz, which I only perceived later. The figure would be unintel\nligible to unscientific persons, and had nothing striking about it but\nthe detached part (Fig. 31), which was like the claw of a cray-fish.\nBut this shape, detached or otherwise, was to be found in 5 other\nfigures.\nPosition 2 was selected by means of dice, and the edges of the\ndiagram were covered with sheets of paper as usual. I then arranged\nthe vertical screen with its opening, and the inclined mirror intended\nto reflect and invert the horizontal figure.\nWhen Signa Maria had put her eye to the hole, I uncovered the\npicture, and then covered it again at the usual signal. The observa\ntion lasted 25 seconds. The figure was so disposed that nothing could\nbe seen through the hole in the screen but its inverted reflection.\nElvira now wrote, \" Have you anything to say 1 I am quite satisfied.''\nI asked her to invert the figure, and she answered, \" Very well, I will\ntry.\"\nMarch 12th. 8 a.m.\u2014As usual Sig\"a Maria had said nothing about\nthe dream, nor had Angelina. We asked Elvira if she had tried and\nsucceeded. She said, \" Yes, I have tried as usual, and hope I have\nsucceeded; but if I have not quite done so, excuse me.\" Siga Annetta\nthen questioned the child, who said she had dreamt of a picture with\n\fTelepathic Dream-i Experimentally Induced. 287\na round thing and a long thing. Siga Annctta took her the book, and\nreturned in a few minutes with it open at p. 221, Figs. 30 and 31, the\nright ones, but in Position 1 \u2014that is, right side up. I went down to\nquestion Angelina, and she said she had seen it so.\nIt will be seen that, besides the specular inversion, the figure had\nbeen turned 90 degrees on its own axis.\nI caused Sigoa Maria, when searching for her yesterday's picture, to\nlook at the book as reflected in the mirror, and in Position 2. She chose\nFig. 29,1 excluding the small Fig. 28 close to it. When asked why\nFigs. 30 and 31 (the right ones) would not do, she replied that they were\nnot like, because of the long thing, and the separate part (Fig. 31).\nThus it is evident that the two points which enabled the percipient\nto recognise the pictures were exactly those which faded first from the\nempirical consciousness of the person who transmitted them.\nExperiment 47.\u2014[Evening.]\u2014As I had seen that Signa Mariu\ndid not see the picture easily when the mirror was used, I aban\ndoned the plan for the time, and used pairs of symmetrical figures\nmade on the spot. This was easily done by dropping ink on a piece\nof paper, doubling the paper, and rubbing it over, so as to obtain\ncomplicated and outlined marks. I used an ink made of an\naniline colour dissolved in a mixture of water and glycerine. When\nthe paper was cut in two along the crease, one half was a specular\nimage of the other. One half was then used for the observa\ntion, and afterwards, mixed with the others, was to be recognised,\n\u2014or rather not recognised,\u2014by Signa Maria, while the second half,\nalso mixed up with the others, was to be recognised by the child. Such\nfigures would naturally be difficult to describe in words, or to copy,\nunless the copyist could draw. I took five pieces of paper, twice\nas long as they were broad, making, when folded and torn in two, ten\nsquare pieces ; I then shuffled them carefully, and taking them as\nthey came, numbered them from 1 to 10, so that no one could divine\nfrom the numbers which figure was the half of which other. I kept\nthem in their case, and chose Fig. 9 by means of the dice. I got\nPosition 4 (always regarding the side where the ordinal numbers were\nwritten as the top) and put it before Signa Maria, who looked at it for\n50 seconds. It was then quickly replaced in my pocket with the\nothers. I asked Elvira to execute its specular inversion, and myself\nremained ignorant of the number and position of the figure which\nwould correspond to it after the operation.\nSig\u2122 Maria went down to say good-night to her mother while\nAngelina was sleeping. I then sealed her into her room as before,\n1 Fig. 29 closely resembles part of Fig. 30.\u2014Eu.\nz 2\n\f288 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\ntaking the additional precaution of noting on paper the exact size of\nthe seals, and even of the drops of sealing-wax, as well as of the\ninevitable creases in the paper.\nMarch 13th. 7.30 a.m.\u2014I found Angelina and Siga Annetta\nalready up, but the fonner had only been awake since 7, and had but\njust risen. I went upstairs, and, unseen by any one, examined the\nseals, which I found intact. I tore the paper and entered, finding\nSigna Maria still asleep. Meanwhile Siga Annetta questioned the\nchild, who had dreamt of a picture on a paper. I then sent the ten\npictures to the child, the pairs being thoroughly mixed, telling her she\nmust look at them from all sides.\nElvira wrote, \" I have tried, but am afraid I did not quite succeed\nin inverting the figure.\"\nSig\" Annetta soon called me down, and Angelina showed me Fig. 6\nin Position 3. Now, the inversion of the figure as I had directed\nwould really have given Fig. 6, but in Position 1 instead of 3.\nWhen Angelina was asked how she recognised the figure, and if\nshe had seen it all in her dream, she replied that she had seen it all,\nbut that she had particularly noticed the pigeon, which was a small\ndetached spot, like a flying bird. Now the pigeon is very much more\napparent in Angelina's Fig. 6 than in its corresponding half which\ngjgna Maria had looked at the day before, because the ink had not\nstuck so well on the latter, and this left it doubtful whether the child\nmight not have picked out 6 instead of 9, not because the inversion\nhad really taken place, but because the pigeon on Fig. 6 chiefly\nattracted her attention.1\nAfter fresh shuffling, the pictures were taken to Sig\"a Maria, who\nchose Fig. 7, Position 4, which was the one most like the Fig. 9,\nwhich she had really seen. She rejected Figs. 6 and 9 because of\nthe separate spots, which were just the pigeons on which Angelina\nfounded her recognition.\nExperiment 48.\u2014March loth. Evening.\u2014During the present\nsitting, the child was asleep in the room with me and Signa Maria. I\nhad prepared another set of 10 figures for to-night's experiment in\nsymmetrical pairs in the way already described, and chose No. 4\nby lot.\n[This experiment was a failure ; Angelina chose the wrong picture\nnext day. Signa Maria hesitated between Figs. 4 and 10, and finally\nchose 10,]\n1 It must also be observed that the number 9, written on the diagram, closely\nresembles a 0 upside down, which might have made recognition through verbal\ndescription possible in this case. \u2014Ed.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 2S9\nExperiment 49.\u2014March 18th. 4.30 p.m.\u2014For this night's experi\nment I had prepared 10 more figures in symmetrical pairs like the\nothers. They were numbered at random, and this time the number\nwas lightly traced in pencil on their backs. I found this change\nnecessary, because when I had gone downstairs the morning before to\ndiscover Angelina's choice, I had found that she, impelled by a very\ninopportune desire for symmetry, had arranged the pictures in order\nbefore her, so as to bring the number in each into its right hand upper\ncorner, and this would not only embarrass the search for the true\nposition in case of success, but also interfere with the recognition ;\nindeed this may well have been the cause of the last failure.\nFig. 10, Position 2 (with regard to the number on the back) was\nchosen by hazard. The observation lasted 45 seconds. I asked Elvira\nto invert the figure, making the top the bottom. To which she replied,\n\" All right, I understand perfectly. I have seen better this time, and\nhope to succeed.\"\nMarch 19th. 7.36 a.m.\u2014Angelina had only just got up. Sig\"a\nMaria was still in bed ; she said she had not talked of the dream to\nany one. Elvira communicated, said she had tried, and hoped, as\nusual Angelina told Sig\" Annetta that she had dreamt of a paper\nwith a blot upon it. I took the ten figures downstairs to her and\nleft her with Sig* Annetta. Five minutes after (I have since kept\naccount of the time the child spends in searching), Biga Annetta\ncalled me. I found that Angelina had chosen Fig. 10, Position 4 (see\nPlate EEL, Fig. VII.); the one observed [by Signt Maria], but turned\n180 deg. instead of being specularly inverted as had been arranged.\nThe figure representing this inversion was Fig. 5 in Position 1, and\nSig* Annetta told me that Angelina had looked at and rejected it.\nThe latter said she recognised the figure by its whole appearance ; she\nseemed disgusted and weary.\nSigo* Maria chose Fig. 2, Position 3 (see Plate III., Fig. VIII.),\nwhich is the most like 10, except 5, its corresponding pair.\nExperiment 50.\u2014March 12th. Evening.\u2014Elvira advised me not\nto give the figure which had been observed to Angelina among the\nothers, but merely its corresponding half, till the child had had some\nexercise. This method renders the success of the inversion rather\nillusory, but it appeared worth while to adopt it provisionally.\nAfter the observation of the picture, Signa Maria was shut into her\nroom with the same precautions as before.\nMarch 20th. 7.55 a.m.\u2014Sifp Annetta, whom I saw first, told me\nher daughter had been indisposed in the night, and that therefore the\ndoor had been opened. Angelina had also been restless and coughing.\nBefore the child was questioned, Elvira communicated as follows :\u2014\n\f290 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\n\"It is not my fault at all. I came three times in the night, and could\nnever succeed. The first time the child was furious, and I tried to\nquiet her. When I came again she was awake with a cough, and\nMaria was obliged to give her some medicine. The third time Maria\nwas ill, and I tried to help her, and so I let the dream go ; but it was\nnot my fault.\"\nExperiment 51.\u2014March 2lst. 4 p.m.\u2014Elvira wrote that she had\nno engagements for the coming night, and asked to be shown the new\npicture. I had divided the pictures into two groups, in order to be\nable to follow the advice Elvira had given me the day before yester\nday. The five original figures, so to speak, from which the one to be\nobserved was to be selected, were in one group, and the corresponding\nfive inverted ones in the other. The latter were to be given to\nAngelina to select from after the dream, and were not to be seen by\nMaria ; the original five were to be shown to Maria for recognition, or\nrather for non-recognition.\nIn view of the fact, so carefully studied by Binet,1 that distraction\nof the attention of the normal personality increases the perceptive\npowers of the sub-conscious personality [and considering that], even if\nthe diversion of the medium's attention during observation should not\nimprove the results, it would be a new obstacle for the partisans of the\nfraud theory to overcome, I determined to adopt the plan.\nI chose one of the original figures and its position (2) by lot. (The\nnumbers in this case and for the future are on the back of the drawing).\nI talked to Signa Maria during the 40 seconds' observation. Directly\nafter, she said she did not know what she had been looking at. I\nforgot to tell Elvira to invert the picture.\nMarch llnd. 4 p.m.\u2014I was not able to go in the morning, and\nhad little hope that the child would remember the picture, even if she\nhad dreamt of it.\nSigna Maria told me that the child had been vexed at my non\nappearance in the morning, because she had dreamt of the picture so\nplainly, and now would not be rewarded as usual by a sweetmeat.\nShe was fetched from school, and Sig* Annetta gave her the five\ninverted pictures, while I gave the five originals to Sign\" Maria.\nAngelina was alone ; Signa Maria and I together in the next room.\nThe latter said it was no use looking, for she remembered nothing.\nHowever, she selected a figure, which was not only the wrong one, but\nalso bore the least resemblance to the right.\n1 Binet. Let alterations de la pertonnaliti. International Scientific Library,\nParis, 1892.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 291\nAfter a short time, Siga Annetta called me, and Angelina showed\nme Fig. 2, Position 3, which is the inverted impression of the picture\nthat had been observed, but turned through 90 degrees.\nExperiment 52.\u2014I went back in the evening with a new series of\npictures. Till now I had separated the symmetrical pairs of pictures\nwith a paper-knife. This time, after doubling them together, I cut off\na narrow strip, including the crease, with a ruler and pocket-knife,\nthus making it impossible to discover on which side the crease\u2014i.e.,\nthe axis of symmetry\u2014had been. I took care to allow for the loss of\nthe narrow strip, and to leave the halves exactly square. I did this\non the three following occasions also.\nThis time Angelina was in bed and asleep in the room where\nSig\"4 Maria and I communicated with Elvira and the observation took\nplace ; but from her position she could not have seen the figure even if\nshe had been awake.\nNo. 5 of the primary figures was chosen by lot The observation\nlasted 35 seconds, and I diverted Sig\"a Maria's attention by talking\nand by singing a favourite air of hers. When it was over I again\nnoticed that the picture was No. 5, Position 1.\nI asked Elvira if she had seen enough, and if she would turn the\nfigure upside-down. I also asked her to explain why the last picture\nhad been rotated 90 deg. She replied, \" I have seen quite well ; and\nyou told me nothing about last night's picture, so I turned it in that\nway.\"\nSigna Maria went to her room without having uttered a word with\nregard to the experiments, and I sealed her in with all the previously\ndescribed precautions.\nMarch 23rd. 8 a.m.\u2014Sig,la Maria was still in her room, and\nAngelina had only just risen, having waked at 7.30. I went up to\nSig\"a Maria's room, and found all intact. Elvira wrote as usual, \" I\nhave tried,\" etc.\nWhile I was upstairs I heard Siga Annetta questioning Angelina\nabout her dreams, and the latter replied that she had dreamt of\nblotted paper. I then carried down the five inverted pictures to the\nchild, and returning gave the five original ones to Signa Maria. Sign*\nMaria first said she remembered none of them, but on further examina\ntion chose Fig. 2, Position 2 (see Plate III. Fig. X), which was not the\none observed, but perhaps the most like it. I must remark that this\ntime I had taken pains to make the figures much alike in type and\nsize. Signa Maria's reason for rejecting Fig. 5 was that it had a dark\nround spot on a clearer background, low down towards the left (with\nregard to its position when observed), and that as a whole it was too\nmuch rounded.\n\f292 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nIn 10 minutes Siga Annetta called me down. Angelina showed\nme Fig. 1, Position 1 (see Plate TII., Fig. IX), which corresponded\nexactly to the observed figure and was inverted as pre-arranged.\nExperiment 53.\u2014About 4 p.m., I returned to the house. Elvira\nhaving consented to another trial, Fig. 2, Position 4, were chosen by lot\nfrom a new batch of five original figures. The revolution was to be\nfrom right to left this time, and Elvira did not promise success, as it\nwas the first time she had turned a picture in this direction.\n[On account of the time of day, no blockade was possible, bet\nAngelina was watched by Siga Annetta. This experiment failed,\nthough Elvira wrote that she \" had tried.\"]\nExperiment 54.\u2014March 25th, 4 p.m.\u2014Angelina had for several\ndays had a slight ailment in her eyes, enough to cause painful\ninflammation. I asked Elvira if we should defer the experiment, as\ndeep sleep was necessary, but she replied that, in her opinion, we\nshould try all the same. So the observation was made while I\nconversed with Signa Maria.\nMarch 26th. 7.43 a.m.\u2014Siga Annetta told me that Angelina had\nbeen crying in the night from the pain in her eyes. Signa Maria was\nstill in bed. On communicating with Elvira, she wrote, \" I fear a com\nplete failure, not through my fault, but on account of the child. Ask\nher, however, but I promise nothing good.\" She added, \" It would be\nwell to rest two or three days, till she is better.\"\n'When the child was questioned, she said she had not dreamt of\nanything.\nAs circumstances continued unfavourable, I was unable to go on\nwith this series of dream pictures. From the little I have been able\nto do, it results that dreams of figures without alteration, and also\nrotated in their own plane, may be said to have succeeded ; while\nspecular inversion has given inconclusive results.\nResumption op Scenic Dreams.\nOn April 1st, when Angelina was better, Elvira announced (by\nautomatic writing) that in three or four days we should be able to\nrecommence the dreams.\nExperiment 55. April 5th.\u2014I asked her if she believed we could\nagain try the transference of images from Angelina to Signa Maria\nin the waking state, which had been interrupted. She replied that\non the contrary we had better return to the dreams, adding that it\nwould be necessary to begin over again, i.e., with the dreams of\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 293\nanimated scenes. I therefore proposed a scene for the next night\nwhich Elvira accepted with pleasure, because, said she, \"It amuses the\nchild.\" But when 1 went next day, at 2.30 p.m., to sec Sig1\"i Maria,\nshe told me she had forgotten to question the child who was now at\nschool. Elvira said she had tried in vain in the night, l\u00abecause a\nstranger had slept with Angelina,\u2014a circumstance unknown to me,\nand which Sigoa Maria had not meant to tell me. A neighbour had\nbeen prevented from sleeping in her own house.\nExperiment 56. April 6th.\u2014I proposed that Elvira should make\nAngelina dream that she and Signa Maria were on the Campanile of\nfs. Marco at Venice, and that she should notice that the pigeons usually\nflying round were green. (This at least is what is written in my\njournal.)\nElvira answered, \" Very well, but there must be no strangers ;\nthen I promise to succeed.\"\nFrom Experiment 56 [to the end of the present series], Angelina\nslept with Sig* Annetta, and Signa Maria slept alone in another room.\nAngelina related the dreams to Siga Annetta directly after waking,\nand before communicating with Signa Maria. Sign Annetta has since\ntold me that, unless some one was ill, she always locked herself in\nwith Angelina.\nApril 1th. Evening.\u2014Signa Maria said that Angelina had dreamt\nof being on a high Campanile with her ; she did not mention that of\nS. Marco. She saw beautiful large birds (she did not say pigeons),\nwith feathers of lovely blue.\nOn my remarking that the blue colour was a mistake, because I\nhad arranged that the birds should be green, Signa Maria said I was\nwrong, and that she remembered I had said blue. Elvira wrote\nthat Signa Maria was right. As I could not remember very clearly,\nand as I know that Elvira's memory is far better than mine, I\nyielded.\nIn the present dream there are two points which tend to show that\nit was not produced by verbal suggestion. The first is the non-recog\nnition of the Campanile of S. Marco, a thing compatible with the real\nvision of the scene, on the part of a child who had seen it only from\nbelow ; all the more that in her dream she was not looking at the\npanorama below (in which case she might easily have recognised\nVenice), but at the coloured pigeons. The second point is that she\ndid not grasp the idea of pigeons, but perceived rather a strangely\ntransformed image of them, which she did not recognise as pigeons.\nExperiment 57.\u2014I proposed the following dream for the next\nnight :\u2014Angelina goes to a cellar with Siga Annetta, who draws some\n\f294 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nwine, and going away forgets to turn the tap. Angelina remains in\nthe cellar while the wine runs out, and amuses herself with paddling\nin it.\nElvira added, \" If you like, I will prolong the dream, and add\nsomething.\" To which I consented.\nApril 8th. 2.15 p.m.\u2014Signa Maria told me that Angelina had\ndreamt of going with Siga Annetta down some steps into a dark\nplace (she did not say cellar), where she saw the keg that stood in the\nyard. Siga Annetta drew some wine, and did not close the tap\nproperly. A quantity of wine ran out over the ground, and Angelina\nsaid she had bathed her hands and feet in it, but saw she had spotted\nher blue frock, and became frightened lest Sign8, Maria should scold\nher. In fact, she dreamt that the latter not only scolded, but\nwhipped her. This dream, which Siga Annetta also recounted without\nthe least difference, was, therefore, carried out with precision, with the\nlittle tragi-comic introduction of the whipping, which was the addition\nElvira had promised. But it must not be said that Elvira had\ndeparted from her rule of never producing impressions injurious to the\nchild, because, if one reflects, this was a little educative lesson.\nBerillon could not have given a better, considering the age of the\nsubject.\nThis dream bears no trace of verbal suggestion, but it does bear\ntraces of a direct sensorial perception of the scene. There being no\nunderground cellars in Venice, and none in Signa Maria's house at\nPadua, nor in any other house known to Angelina, the latter has no\nidea of them, though she may have of cellars above ground. Now I\nhad simply said cellar, and Angelina would naturally have pictured\nwhat she knew. Instead, we find in the dream an image of new\nsurroundings, for which she had not even a name. Angelina's assertion\nthat the keg was the one in the yard is evidently the result of an\nassociation of ideas.\nElvira asked me if I objected to additions to the dreams. I said,\nno, provided she omitted nothing.\nExperiment 58.\u2014I wished to examine the effect on Angelina of\ndreams involving the use of powers she did not yet possess, so I\nproposed that Elvira should make her dream she could read, and that\nshe actually read in a book a little story which I invented on the spot.\nI asked Elvira if this were possible; she replied that she could\npromise nothing, but would try.\nApril 9th. Evening.\u2014Sig^ Maria told me that Angelina (who\ncontinued to sleep with Siga Annetta) had on waking told the latter\nthat she could read, and that she had read something in a book, but\ncould not remember what. She was so convinced that she could read,\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 295\nthat directly she had risen she took a paper, and imitating a person\nreading, repeated disconnected phrases. And later on, seeing me at a\ndistance in a public place, she insisted on being brought to me to give\nme the important news.\nSig1 Annetta confirmed the dream (she had not Wen present at the\nscene out of doors), and told me that at first she had believed it was a\nlittle trick of Angelina's to get a book bought for her to play with ; but\nthat she had not asked for one.\nElvira wrote, \" You must excuse me if it was not all done ; it was\nthe first time. I hope to succeed in the future.\"\nPerhaps the strength of Angelina's new impression interfered with\nher perception of the imaginary contents of the book.\nExperiment 59.\u2014I asked Elvira if she would repeat this experi\nment She said, \" Yes, I shall be pleased to exercise myself, and then\nif I cannot satisfy you with the writing, I can with the dreams. Tell\nme the dream, that I may go.\"\nSiga Annetta gave me some book, and turning over the leaves at\nhazard, I found the odd word Guglielmeide written in large characters.\nI showed it to Sig1\" Maria, and asked Elvira to make the child read it\nin a dream so that she should remember and recognise it in the book.\nThe child was all this time in bed and asleep, and I carried thft\nbook away with me.\nApril 1Oth. 3 p.m.\u2014Siga Annetta told me that Angelina had again\ndreamt of being able to read, and of reading a word in large letters\nin a book. Signa Maria knew nothing about it, as she had not ques\ntioned the child.\nI sent to fetch Angelina from school, and showed her the book\nopen at the page where the word Guglielmeide was written, and told\nher to look for the word she had seen in her dream. As I saw she\nwas too timid to pay attention, I sent her away with Siga Annetta\nand the book. They soon returned, and Angelina showed me the\nword Guglielmeide, but could not pronounce it. Consequently she\nhad not received an auditory impression of the word, and the dream\nbelongs to the purely visual category. There is no other word in\nlarge letters on the page I showed to the child, and consequently there\nis no proof that she did not recognise it by its size rather than by its\nseparate letters.\nFrom these experiments, which unfortunately were not followed\nup, I drew a hope, which will certainly be realised later on by others,\nof the possibility of teaching reading by means of telepathy.\nExperiment 60.\u2014April Wth. 3 p.m.\u2014Wishing to try again to\nse a dream of something unknown to Sigln4 Maria, but known to\n\f296 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nme, I proposed to Elvira, while she was manifesting herself by means\nof a sensory hallucination to Sig\"\" Maria in her trance state, to show\nthe child in a dream the gasworks at Rovigo, which, as they were\nbeing re-arranged, offered special details entirely unknown to Signa\nMaria, but well known to me, as I was taking part in the work.\nApril 12th. 3.30 p.m.\u2014Angelina had gone to school before seeing\nSigna Maria, who had risen later, and therefore did not know the\nresult of the dream.\nSiga Annetta told me that the child had dreamt of being in the\ncountry, in a house without a roof, where there was much smoke, and\ndirty black men hurrying about. Angelina attributed the burning in\nher eyes to this (she was still suffering from pustules in them). She\nwas sent for, but I could obtain no more details, even by leaving her\nalone with Siga Annetta.\nThis result, although satisfactory from the point of view of the\ntelepathic perception in dreams of ideas drawn from the mind of SigM\nMaria, does not demonstrate the perception of ideas extraneous to it,\nbecause, though the dream was of gasworks, they had no characteristic\nbelonging to those at Rovigo, unknown to Signa Maria.\nExperiment 61.\u2014April 13<A. 2.30 p.m.\u2014Elvira wrote that she\nwould make Angelina dream during the next night. While I was\nsearching for a subject, Elvira sent Signa Maria to sleep, and during\nthe trance I proposed the following dream : Angelina is on the roof\nplaying with a cat ; several white mice appear, and the cat pursues\nthem. Elvira replied that the mice would do, but not the cat, as she\nhad a great objection to these animals. I then proposed to substitute\na dog.\nApril 1ith, about 6 p.m.\u2014Sig\"a Maria said that Angelina had told\na dream to Siga Annetta, but that she did not believe it had any con\nnection with our experiments, because I had not proposed a dream the\nday before. In fact, as Signa Maria was in a trance while I proposed\nthe dream, she could know nothing about it in the waking state. She\ncould only tell me a little of what Angelina had related. Siga Annetta\nthen related the dream ; it was absolutely identical with the pro\ngramme.\nExperiment 62.\u2014When I returned later, Sigua Maria was already\nin bed in the little room. Angelina also was in bed and asleep in the\nnext room. Elvira manifested herself by a sensory hallucination in\nthe trance. I proposed the following dream : Angelina was to see\nthree women with sewing-machines enter the house .about mid-day,\neach carrying a sewing-machine, which they were to offer to\nSign* Maria for sale. Signa Maria, finding them rusty and out of\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 207\norder, refuses them, and the three women go away angry to the iron\nbridge (visible from the house) and throw the machines into the\nwater, grumbling.\nAs I could not seal up Signa Maria's door, I begged Sig\" Annetta\nto watch that no communication took place between her and Angelina.\nShe replied that she was always on the watch, ami that usually\nAngelina related her dream directly she opened her eyes.\nA\/lril loth. 4 p.m. (about).\u2014Sig1ni Maria did not know that\nAngelina had dreamt at all, and having been in a trance when the\ndream was proposed, was also unaware that any dream had been pro\nposed at all.\nSig\" Annetta told me that the child had related a dream about\nthree women coming to sell sewing-machines ; she had dreamt that\nSig08 Maria refused to buy, not for the reasons above stated, but\nbecause she said she had no money. The rest of the dream followed\nthe programme exactly. Angelina had afterwards insisted that when\nthe water was low, the three machines must be fished up ; a new\nexample of the way she objectifies these dreams. The alteration in\nthe reason given for not buying the machines is a natural one to occur\nto the child, who is used to having her own childish demands put\noff with this excuse. Elvira agreed that this was the reason of the\nalteration. This is the only time in the course of the experiments\nin which it is clearly indicated that the alteration was produced by\nthe percipient.\nExperiment 63.\u2014When Elvira manifested in the trance, I proposed\nthe following dream for the next night .\u2014 Angelina was to be a man,\nand to ply the trade of a boatman at Venice. Four English people,\ntwo gentlemen and two ladies, were to come up, with red guide-books.\nThey would explain by gesture that they wanted to go to the Lido,\nand Angelina would accompany them. Elvira added, laughing (we\nare speaking, of course, of the hallucinatory Elvira, seen only by\nSigoa Maria), that the people would wear veils, as they usually do.\nApril l6th. Evening.\u2014Signa Maria was ill in bed with a head\nache. Her mother, to whom I spoke first, told me that Angelina had\ndreamt of being a boatman. She said she had rowed to the Lido\nwith three gentlemen in gloves and veils, who were carrying red\nbooks. When they got to the Lido, one of them fell into the water.\nSign Annetta then asked, \" Did these gentlemen come from England\n(Inghilterra) ? \" Angelina, not understanding the question, replied,\n\"No; they were not on land (in terra), they were on the water.\"\nSig\" Annetta said that the child accompanied her story by mimicking\nthe gestures made in rowing, showing how vivid had been the motor\nimage.\n\f298 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nExperiment 64.\u2014I wished to place Angelina in a dream state still\nmore unlike her real one, so I proposed to Elvira to make her dream\nthat she was grown up and was being married. I left Elvira to\ndevelop this theme.\nApril 17th. Evening.\u2014Siga Annetta said that that morning\nAngelina had told her that she had dreamt she was as tall as\nSigna Maria, and that she was at home in the parlour at Venice.\nMany people were present, and she had a white veil over her head,\nand was leaning on the arm of a gentleman, who put a ring on her\nfinger. Siga Annetta, who, as usual, knew nothing of the proposed\ndream, said, \" Then you were dreaming of your own wedding.\" To\nwhich Angelina ingenuously replied, \" If it was my own wedding,\nwhen shall I find my sweetheart 1 \"\ngigna Maria, who had also been ignorant of the proposed dream\nand had not been present when the child related it, could not on this\naccount either confirm or correct her mother's statement.\nIt cannot be said that this dream was a resuscitation of habitual\nwaking ideas, for Angelina in her short life had never seen a wedding.\nExperiment 65.\u2014When Elvira manifested during Sign\" Maria's\ntrance, I proposed that she should try to show Angelina some place\nknown to herself (Elvira), but unknown to us all ; so that if Angelina\ncould afterwards describe it, we could identify it when Elvira told us\nwhere it was. She accepted, and expressed some hope of success.\nApril 18th. 4.15 p.m.\u2014Siga Annetta told me that the child had\nbeen restless and probably feverish during the night. She had\nquestioned her, and the child had said irritably that she had nothing\nto tell.\nExperiment 66.\u2014I proposed yesterday's programme over again.\nApril 19<\/t. Evening.\u2014Siga Annetta, while her daughter was\nabsent, told me that Angelina had dreamed of being in a Piazza, that\nis, in a Campo (at Venice the Piazze are called Campi), which was\ncrossed by a pathway, on each side of which the ground was paved.\nIn a corner of the Campo there was a church with rough walls and close\nto this the theatre.\nSigna Maria, who^n I afterwards questioned, said she had not heard\nabout the dream.\nElvira (in automatic writing) asked me if I was satisfied with the\ndream. As I did not in the least recognise the spot Angelina hiwi\ndreamt of, I asked Elvira where it was, and she replied :\n\" I am ready to tell you as much as I can. The place is Adria. ;\nthe Piazza, the Piazza Garibaldi ; the theatre is the Orpheus.\"\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 299\nDr. E. \"That is good, but the important thing for me would be\nto know if Maria may not have known the place by dfscription or\notherwise.\"\nElv. \"Well, I am very sure that it is not the sort of place they\nwould make a picture of, so I am quite certain Maria has not seen\nit. Please tell me to-night's dream, for I have no time to stop.\"\nAs I have only been to Adria once as an infant, I could not recognise\nthe description, but I found a friend who knows the little town well, and\nhe told me that the description corresponded exactly with the reality.\nI cannot share the opinion of Elvira that Signa Maria could not\nhave known the place, because prints and photographs of it may exist,\nor she may, perhaps subconsciously, have heard it described. Yet this\nis not probable, for Signa Maria reads very little, and lives an extremely\nretired life. She herself is naturally certain that she knew nothing of\nAdria ; but that proves nothing, because the knowledge may have\nexisted outside the field of consciousness.\nExperiment 67.\u2014I asked Elvira to repeat the experiment of making\nAngelina dream of a place of which neither she nor Signa Maria knew\nanything, and, if possible, of one which the latter could not even\nindirectly have heard of. [This subject was proposed immediately\nbefore Signa Maria went to bed.]\nApril 20th. 3 p.m.\u2014Signa Maria was ill, and her mother told me\nthat Angelina was also indisposed and restless during the night, and\nthat she did not relate any dream in the morning.\nExperiment 68.\u2014Elvira manifested in the trance, and said that the\nchild's state had prevented her acting. The proposed dream was put\noff till the coming night.\nApril 2lsl. Evening.\u2014Angelina had told Siga Annetta in the\nmorning that she had dreamt of being in the same place as before,\nbut on the other side, where there was a beautiful palace with steps\nadorned with flowers. Inside there were gentlemen dressed in black,\nwho gave her sweetmeats. As before, I was completely unable to.\nidentify the place.\nElvira wrote :\u2014\" I transported her to Adria. What I showed her\nwas the hotel of the Stella d'Oro. But I warn you that I showed her\nthe inside, not the outside, of the place, and if you enquire, ask what\nthe staircase of the hotel is like, and the name of the manager. I will\ntell it you if you like. His name is Panciera, but the people at Adria\ncall him Panciotti.\"\nDr. E. \" You have chosen ill ; Maria may easily have heard a\npublic place like that described without knowing or remembering that\nshe had,\"\n\f300 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nNext day I enquired, and found that the hotel of the Stella d'Oro\nreally existed, and had been managed by a man named Panciera, nick\nnamed Panciatti (not Panciotti), but that it had been closed for some\ntime. Besides, the hotel was not really in the Piazza, but in a street\nwhich strikes off it on the side mentioned in the dream, i.e., opposite\nthe church and the theatre.\nI have not yet succeeded in learning anything about the staircase\nwith flowers ; but Angelina may have dreamt of the potted shrubs\nso often seen on the staircases of hotels.\nExperiment 69. \u2014 April 22nd. 4.15 p.m. \u2014 Siga Annetta told me\nthat Angelina had been restless in the night, and in the morning had\nsaid she had dreamt of a place like the Prato delle Valle (a piazza in\nPadua), without being able to give more details.\nAfter Elvira had, in automatic writing, exhorted me to patience as\na means of success, she added, \" I came to make the dream last night\nas usual, although you gave me no directions yesterday.\"\nExperiment 70.\u2014April 23rd. Evening.\u2014Siga Annetta, in the\npresence of her daughter, told me that last night Angelina had\ndreamt of being in a large room with many people. There was no\nfurniture but chairs and benches. Siga Annetta asked her if it was\nlike a theatre, and she said that the seats were like. Angelina\ninsisted that she knew where the place was, and Signa Maria said that\nwhen they were out that day Angelina persisted in wishing to take\nher to the place she had dreamed of, and that when they were passing\nthrough the Piazza dei Signori she pointed to the entrance of the Via\nMaggiore, saying that that was the way to the place.\nWe communicated with Elvira and told her all this ; and I asked\nher what place she had shown the child. She replied, \"Yes, the child\nis right ; I showed her all that. But I will tell you nothing to-night,\nnor make a new dream, but will deepen the impression so that\nAngelina may explain herself better, and to-morrow, at two o'clock,\nyou will know something more. But another time after such a dream,\nyou must take her at once where she wants to go, even a long way, or\ninto the country.\"\nFrom what Signa Maria had said, I had concluded that the hall or\ntheatre belonged to the Circolo Filarmonico, which is in the Via,\nMaggiore. I said nothing, and I was proved to be wrong.\nExperiment 71.\u2014April 24th. 4 p.m.\u2014Angelina had had the same\ndream, and said in my presence that she could find her way to the\nplace. I asked Siga Annetta to go out with her and accompany her\nwherever she pleased.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 301\nAfter they had gone, I put myself in rapport with Elvira, and\nasked her to explain the difficulty about the exact place of the hotel\nof the Stella d'Oro, and whether the child had meant that the stair\ncase was painted with flowers, or adorned with pots of flowers.\nElvira replied, \"No, the poor child was right, but could not explain\nherself. The hotel is not in the Piazza, but in a street opposite the\ntheatre. The staircases are not painted nor adorned with flowers,\nbut the steps are of open work ; that was what she could not\nexplain.\"\nDr. E. \" Then they are of iron, because marble is not treated so.\"\nElv. \" But it is the front of the steps which is of open work, not\nthe part where you put your foot.\"\nDr. E. \" Are they iron 1 \"\nElv. \" Certainly not, and not marble either. I think it is a kind\nof composition, unless they may be iron after all, but coloured very\nlight.\" i\nWhen Elvira's communication was ended, I asked Sig* Annetta to\ncome up and tell me about her walk. She said that Angelina had\nat once begun to hurry, and to look for something. Siga Annetta, on\naccount of a pain in one leg, could not keep up with her, so that\nAngelina was always in front, and as excited as a dog searching\nfor his home. She often looked up at the walls of the houses.\nBig\" Annetta, who is not a native of Padua, could not tell me\nthe names of certain small streets through which they passed, but\nshe made me understand the way they had taken perfectly. At the\nend of the Via S. Agnese, Angelina remarked certain windows adorned\nwith flowers, and said that that was the house whose inside she had seen.\nSig1 Annetta took the number of the house, 1,458, and not perceiving\nthe inscription over the bell, went into a neighbouring shop to ask.\nShe was told that it was the office of the Sociela Fiiarmonica. (This,\nas will be seen, is a little mistake of Siga Annetta's). When\nSig* Annetta asked the child how she had found the house, she said\nshe had gone the way she went in her dream, but that then it was\nnight, for the lamps were lighted. She said also that they were\nplaying in the house, but not singing. I went at once over all the\nground and found No. 1,458, which had an inscription over the bell\nPhUodramatic Club of Padua. Tt is not a Philharmonic Society, as\nSig1 Annetta had mistakenly said. This recognition of a house, the\ninternal arrangements of which are evidently those seen by Angelina,\n1 I found out about this later. The steps have no peculiarity, but the balustrade\nis of marble or cement, with ornaments. On the other hand, Elvira gave me much\ninformation later about the outer and inner appearance of the hotel, its proprietor,\n\u00abc, and I found it for the greater part correct.\n2 a\n\f302 , Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nand where they play, but do not sing,1 is interesting from a double\npoint of view. Firstly, because none of us were consciously aware of\nthe existence of a Philodramatic Society in that place ; and, secondly,\nbecause, as may be seen by looking at a plan of Padua, the road taken\nwas very tortuous, and this shows that the child was not guided by the\nidea of the definite position of the place to be found, but that she was\ndirected by successive recognitions along the road.\nThis is also proved by two other facts. The first is that, as\nSiga Annetta said, Angelina went on looking here and there, as if to\nrecognise a path already gone over. The second is, that when Angelina\nfound herself the day before in the Piazza dei Signori she appeared\nto have known the comparatively direct way to the Philodramatic\nClub (which, as I have said, made me believe that the dream house was\nthe Philharmonic Club), and to-day, on the contrary, she did not know\nthe easy way, but took a very long and tortuous road, partly through\nsmall streets, through which she has probably never passed.\nIn the evening I went back to Signa Maria to try for more accurate\ninformation as to any possible knowledge existing in the family about\nthe Philodramatic Club ; or in Angelina about the streets she had\npassed through. Signa Maria said she was completely ignorant of the\nexistence of the Club, adding that if she had ever passed through the\nVia S. Agnese, she must have done so very seldom. Her mother was\ncertain of never having been through it, and both of them were sure\nthey had never taken Angelina to a place which was to them so far\nout of the way. Angelina was never allowed to leave their house with\nother persons. I must add that Signa Maria lives a very retired life,\nthat she hardly ever leaves the house except for domestic affairs.\nSiga Annetta's topographical memory is exceptionally weak. After\nseven years in Padua she only knows the principal streets.\n[Various circumstances prevented my trying further experiments\nfor some time. But at last] it appeared that the dreams were to\nbegin again on October 2nd. Instead of which, another personality\nmanifested on that day, whom I will call B., and who up to the present\ntime had only helped with a series of experiments on the estimation\nof intervals of time. She told me that she was now in a position to\nundertake experiments of more importance, and asked my permission\nto make an experiment the following night in place of the dream\npromised by Elvira. Not wishing to refuse, but rather desirous to\nknow if she could do better than Elvira, I agreed ; and the following\nday brought a result so interesting that I thought it wise to put off\nthe telepathic dreams for the present and to continue the study of the\n1 1 found that there was a hall, which had been used just at the time for some\nprivate representations.\n\fTelepathic Dreavis Experimentally Induced. 303\nstrange and varied manifestations produced by B., and often by\nAdriano, in Signa Maria's house at night. But this study, which aims\nat discovering whether these manifestations occur in a supernormal\nway, or are explicable by a simple alteration in the personality of\nSigna Maria, must be related in another place.\nConclusion.\nTaking all the facts here recorded into consideration, I think it\nbest for the present to lay no claim to the discovery of a new\nphenomenon, but to ascribe the results attained to an agency now\nknown and undisputed\u2014viz., telepathy\u2014and I shall proceed to con\nsider them from this point of view.\nDuplication of the Agent.\u2014Tn the course of the experiments here\ndescribed, the interesting fact is revealed that two personalities take\npart in the action ;\u2014 first, the telepathic agent, who produces the tele\npathic transference of the picture, and, secondly, Signa Maria, so far\nas sensorial, whose senses supply to the telepathic agent the picture to\nbe transferred. In the dreams of figures, the sensorial agent receives\nthe sensorial image, \u2014which has to be transferred to the telepathic\nagent,\u2014shortly before transferring it. In the case of the scenic dreams,\nthe telepathic agent chooses from amongst the images already existing\nin the recent or remote memory of the sensorial agent the one which\nis best fitted for the operation he has to perform. As we have seen,\nnone of the present experiments demonstrate that the telepathic agent\nhas transferred images which he himself has directly perceived without\nthe intervention of the sensorial agent's normal senses. The experi\nments also showed the incapacity of the normal personality of Sign\"\nMaria for fulfilling the office of telepathic agent;\u2014i.e., she is unable by\nher own will to transfer images to the percipient telepathically.\nI do not pretend to have discovered anything new, when I make a\ndistinction between the two personalities which unite for telepathic\naction ; it is well known, on the contrary, that this fact is considered\nfundamental not only by modern spiritualists, but by occultists in all\ntimes and places, who, however, press its interpretation further. But\nI think it useful to insist on this point for the sake of those who study\nonly the telepathic branch of psychical science ; because the recogni\ntion of the existence of a special personality, producing the telepathic\naction, affords some explanation of much that seems capricious in the\nresults of experimental telepathy, and warns the experimenter not to\nneglect any means of putting himself into rapport with the telepathic\nagent. If I had not been previously in rapport with the personality\ncalled Elvira, and had not asked her aid, it is probable that I should\nnever have had an opportunity of observing a single telepathic dream.\n2 a 2\n\f304 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nOr if I had undertaken a series of experiments, putting her out of the\nquestion, the proportion of successes might have been very small.\nI maintain, then, that the existence of a telepathic agent,\u2014whose\npersonality is not only distinct from the normal one of the sensorial\nagent, but also differs from it in psychical faculty,\u2014must be regarded as\nthe key to everything in this branch of experimental telepathy, if the\nresults are capable of any interpretation at all.\nIn order not to be misunderstood, I may point out that recognition\nof the existence of the telepathic agent as a separate personality, does\nnot involve any hypothesis as to its nature ; it may be a psychical\nproduct of the sensorial agent, or it may possess an independent exist\nence. Taking the word personality in the sense which modern\npsychologists give to it\u2014that is, a succession of states of consciousness,\ndiscontinuous, perhaps, but held together by memory and the conscious\nness of the Ego\u2014then Elvira is certainly a personality.\nInfluence of the States of the Sensorial Agent, of the Percipient, and of\nthe Telepathic Agent, upon the Results.\n[For the success of the experiments, it appeared] that a profound\nand tranquil sleep [on the part of the percipient] was, if not a necessary,\nat least a most favourable condition, and that disturbance of body or\nmind had a contrary effect. I find that out of 17 cases in which the\npercipient was ill or agitated, only 5 were successes, i.e., 29 per cent. ;\nwhile there are 49 among the other 53 (No. 55 excluded, for reasons\nalready stated), i.e., 92 per cent.\nAs for the sensorial agent, she was as a rule asleep at the time of\naction, and consequently in the most favourable condition for telepathic\naction. It would be interesting to know if, and how often, the influence\nwas exercised when Signa Maria was by chance awake, and with what\nresults. But on this point I have no data.\nIn 6 cases (Experiments 4, 23, 4.3, 50, 53, 67) Signa Maria's rest\nwas disturbed by physical causes, and in 1 case (Experiment 22) by\nmoral causes; and among these cases there was only one success (No.\n43). But in 5 of them (Nos. 4, 22, 50, 53, 67) the percipient was also\ndisturbed in the night, so that these failures may be attributed to\nher. There remain 2 cases (Nos. 23 and 43) in which the sensorial\nagent was disturbed and the percipient was in her normal state, and of\nthese two cases, No. 43, though registered as an incomplete success, is\nremarkable as having been a dream of a very difficult figure, executed\nwhen the blockade was complete; the only mistake concerned the\nrotation. But as the data are few and inexact, we cannot draw anv\nconclusions worthy of note as to the influence of the state of the\nsensorial agent upon the results.\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 305\nIt will not be out of place to consider the state of the sensorial agent\nwhile the programme was being communicated to the telepathic agent.\nOf the 16 experiments in which the programme was proposed to Elvira\nwhile Sig^ Maria was in the trance, only one was a failure, and even\nthis may be accounted for by the severe indisposition of the percipient\nduring the night. Besides, of the 4 experiments with dreams of\nfigures, when Sign\" Maria's attention was distracted during the observa\ntion, there were 2 failures in 2 cases when Angelina was indis\nposed, while the other 2 were successes, one of which was remarkable\nfor the vividness of the dream, which was remembered many hours\nafter waking, although the object dreamt of was a formless spot.\nWe may infer from this that telepathic action takes place more\neasily when the image to be transferred remains outside the conscious\nness of the agent ; or it may be that the telepathic agent can execute\nthe transference of the image all the better for its slight adherence to\nthe personality of the sensorial agent. This is not only possible, but is\nrendered probable by the remarkable fact that the transferred image\nhas a tendency to escape from the normal memory of the sensorial\nagent later on.\nAmnesia of the Sensorial Agent for Images Telepathicalfy Transferred.\nThe first experiences of this amnesia showed that it was not a\nsimple amnesia ; because if it had been complete, Signa Maria would\nhave been incapable of recognising even any approximation to the\nfigure,\u2014she would have chosen one at hazard, happening to choose the\nright one as often as chance permitted ; and if the amnesia were\nincomplete, then her choice would have been restricted to a few\nfigures resembling the one observed, and therefore she would have\nfailed in her search less frequently, according to the law of chance ;\nwhereas what really happened was that she always chose one of the\nsimilar figures, but never the right one.\nWe have to do, then, with two memories belonging to two strata\nof consciousness\u2014the normal memory, which recalls the observed\nfigure only approximately and directs the sensorial agent's attention\nto those which resemble it, and a second memory, belonging to a\ndeeper stratum of consciousness, which preserves some clear mark\nof recognition, but, with a view to non-recognition, exercises an\ninhibitory action on the first. The inhibition does not relate to the\nsensorial image, but to a judgment with respect to the time of\nperception of the image, making it appear to be then seen for the first\ntime.\nIn many cases of scenic dreams, the recollection of the programme\nendured sufficiently well for Signa Maria to observe differences between\n\f300 Dr. G. B. Ermacora.\nthe dream and the programme afterwards. But I cannot tell whether\nin these cases the normal memory may not have suffered some restric\ntion. In another series of experiments lately commenced, I have\nnoticed a want of attention on the part of Sig,,a Maria's normal\npersonality, for, though she was awake, she was apparently under the\ninfluence of a suggestion to pay no attention while I repeated the pro\ngramme. Taking the facts together, it seems that a state of inatten\ntion, as well as the somnambulic state, is favourable to telepathic\naction, and we can discover a connection between them and the\namnesia already described.\nWe are able to suggest reasons why the amnesia is constant and\ncomplete in the dreams of figures, while in the case of the scenic\ndreams it only occurred in a partial way.\nThe pictures being quite new to Signa Maria, and being expressly\nchosen as not lending themselves to an association of ideas, their\nsensorial images did not find in the normal consciousness any co-ordi\nnation, nor consequently any point of connection with pre-existing\nimages ; therefore when transferred to another stratum of consciousness\nthey naturally left no trace in the normal one. On the other hand,\nthe old images utilized in the scenic dreams, being connected by\ninnumerable strong links to the whole complex of the normal conscious\nness, were necessarily more easy to reproduce in another stratum than\nif they had been transferred as they stood ; and if thus transferred,\nthey must necessarily have revived immediately in the normal\nconsciousness through the connecting links of association.\nWhat the nature of the telepathic agent may be it is as yet impossible\nto divine, but we shall have made a step forward to this discovery\nwhen we can reckon up, not only the results of my few experiments,\nbut of the innumerable ones of the spiritists, for the telepathic\nagents are the same as the personalities which the spiritists call spirits,\nand which I have called mediumistic personalities. But if we cannot\nsay what they are, we can at least say what they are not.\nThose who have no knowledge of mediumistic phenomena have long\nbeen satisfied\u2014and continue to satisfy themselves\u2014with a confusion\nof ideas which will probably become famous in the history of scientific\nerrors. They have declared that the mediumistic personality is the\nsame as that provoked by suggestion in somnambulism. My own\nview is that the hypnotic personalities have no real existence, and are\nneither new nor interesting. In the hypnotic state, the subject, being\nbetter able to concentrate his attention, becomes a better actor,\u2014that\nis all ; but a few glasses of wine would produce the same effect. If\nhe believes himself to be the person he represents, that is no more\nthan it is said many actors can do. Consequently there is in this no\ntrue change of personality, but only what Richet calls an dljtctitica\n\fTelepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced. 307\nHon of types. It is a state of spontaneous dream of such intensity as\nto become motor as well as sensory.\nThe spontaneous changes of personality, accompanied by alterations\nof the mental faculties, of sensibility, and often of the pathological\ncondition, of which we have abundant examples, are more worthy of\nthe name, and must not be confounded with that just mentioned ;\nbecause here the cause is deeper and the consequences more stable.\nBut even in these cases the new personalities have the general charac\nteristics of the normal personality, without any fresh element, and thus\nmay be more justly regarded as mere alterations of the normal, or as\nresulting from its disintegration, as Pierre J anet says.\nI am aware that many modern spiritualists, unfamiliar with\npsychology, confound these intelligences with those of another kind,\nwhich they regard as belonging to discarnated spirits. But the\nmediumistic personalities of which I now speak possess\u2014besides a\npersonality of the normal human type\u2014a series of faculties which the\nlatter does not possess, and are able to produce such manifestations\nas are not only impossible to the normal human personality, but\nare so inconceiveable to the latter as to be regarded a \/iriori as\nimpossible.\nConsequently, to confound the two is a palpable error. The\nniediumistic personalities cannot be a product of disintegration,\nbecause they contain a mass of new elements, and it would be nearer\nthe truth to consider them products of integration, as Mr. Myers says ;\nor as manifestations in the sensory field of an entire order of psychical\nactivities usually excluded from it. Professor Boiracl proposes the\nname of parapsychical phenomena for these supernormal psychical facts,\nbut the term hyper\/lsychical is, perhaps, more appropriate.\nWhen we reflect on the identity of the telepathic agents and the\nmediumistic personalities, and the absolute difference between their\nfaculties and modes of action and those of the normal personality, a\npartial conciliation between the opposing theories of spiritism and\ntelepathy seems possible. The spiritists believe that telepathy is\nproduced by discarnated spirits, or by living spirits which can\ntemporarily separate themselves from their bodies. The non-\nspiritists who recognise telepathy, believe in some action between\nbrain and brain, and that certain arguments on which the spiritists\nbase their belief are false interpretations of phenomena produced\nmerely by telepathy between the living.\nThe idea of secondary or mediumistic personalities acting as\ntelepathic agents has the advantage of offering common ground to\nthe two opposing theories. Not only spiritists, but also telepathists,\n1 Anruiies dts Science) Psyehiqwt, 1893, p. 341.\n\f308 Dr. G. B. Ermticora.\nshould recognise that the true telepathic agent, in cases of this kind, is\nnot to be found in what is commonly called the human intelligence,\nbut that it forms part of an absolutely different kind of intelligence.\nIf this point is well considered, a great part of the divergence between\nthe two theories is eliminated.\nThe fact that on most occasions in spontaneous telepathy the figure\nof the person supposed to send the message is seen, does not at all\nindicate that such person is the agent. This view is borne out by the\nexperiments described above. In fact, the representation of either\nthe sensorial or the telepathic agent in the dreams was seen to be a\ncircumstance entirely extraneous to the production of the dreams ; or,\nin other words, as the presence of the image of the sensorial agent\nin no way indicated that it was the real agent, so also the absence of\nthat of the telepathic agent would not in the least signify that it was\nnot the real agent.\nSumming up all the previous considerations, it seems to me that a\nbeginning of an explanation of telepathy, based solely on experience,\nmay be given by admitting the existence of telepathic agents, of a\nnature unknown to us, but certainly different from the personalities\ntreated of in ordinary psychology. These agents, in consequence of a\nvoluntary or involuntary excitation coming from the sensorial agent,\ntransmit to a distance, by processes known to themselves, the ideas\nthey were charged to convey, or which of their own initiative they\njudge it opportune to convey.\nBut experience teaches us something more, and that is that the\ntelepathic agent can induce the transference of ideas as well by the\nwill of the sensorial agent, when the percipient is unwarned,\u2014for\ninstance, in the Verity case,\u2014as by the will of the percipient, when the\npersonality of the sensorial agent remains entirely unconcerned with\nthe phenomenon,\u2014as in the Stead case. Elvira shows that she can\nnot only act in the first way, as in the cases here described, but also\nin the second. She did this in a series of experiments in telepathy\nwhere Signa Maria was percipient by means of automatic writing, while\nAngelina acted as sensorial agent, being awake, but unconscious of\nwhat was happening. This series, though much less interesting, may\nperhaps be described elsewhere.\n[The above paper is translated and somewhat abridged from the\noriginal Italian. For the more complete account, including further\ntheoretical discussions, readers are referred to Dr. Ermacora's Italian\narticle, which will shortly be published in the Biviela di Studi\nPsichici.\u2014Ed.]\n\fP!a.te I\n\f\fPlatefl\n\f\f\f\fPsychical Phenomena Bearing upon Spirit Control. 309\nV.\nSOME PSYCHICAL PHENOMENA BEARING UPON THE\nQUESTION OF SPIRIT CONTROL.\nBy Charles Hill Tout,\nPrincipal of Buckland College, Vancouver, B.C.\nA wave of interest in psychical matters passing over our locality\nabout three years ago, due in part to the transit across our horizon of\na psychic star of some magnitude from the neighbourmg Western\nStates, enabled me to bring about the formation of a small body of\ninquirers for the purpose of first-hand investigation into spiritistic\nphenomena. A half-dozen of us arranged to meet twice a week. It\nwould be tedious to give in detail the results of our \" sittings \"; it will\nbe sufficient to say that our experience was of a very mild type.\nSitting in the dark as a rule, subjective lights in the form of luminous\nvapour were occasionally seen by myself and one other member. I\nwas at first inclined to attribute these to our imagination, but as they\nseem to be a matter of common experience in spiritistic circles, I sup\npose they may be regarded as having some sort of reality of their own,\nand may perhaps be taken as evidencing incipient powers of clairvoy\nance in the seers.\nThe lady members of our circle, particularly a mother and her\ndaughter, were taken almost from the first sitting with spasmodic\ntwitchings and movements in the fingers and arms. Sometimes these\nmovements were very violent, causing them to slap and thump the\ntable with such force as to seriously bruise their fingers and hands.\nOften we were obliged to withdraw their hands by main force from the\ntable,\u2014the ladies being unable of themselves to do so,\u2014or to place\naomething between their bands and the table to soften the effects of\nthe blows.\nWith the exception of these two ladies, none of the other sitters\nwere much affected on these occasions, though at times an almost\nirresistible impulse came upon myself to imitate their actions ; but\nthough I occasionally allowed the impulse, at the suggestion of\nthe other sitters, to have full play, it never with me took the\nbit between its teeth and got beyond my control. I could always\nstop at once any movements in my limbs, or change the attitude of\nmy mind, by an effort of will. Almost from the first an overpowering\n\f310 Charles Bill Tout.\ndrowsiness would come upon some of us, especially upon myself and\nMiss G., the young lady who beat the table so violently. My head\nwould become as heavy as lead, and I sometimes had the greatest\ndifficulty in sitting in my chair. At times this stupor would get the\nbetter of me, and my head would drop to the table, seemingly drawn\ndown to it by some' force in the table itself. After an interval of a\nmoment or two, T could sit up again. My spiritistic friends assured\nme on these occasions that if I would give myself up to the influence\nupon me I should pass into the trance state, and I think it possible\nthat I might have done so if I could have sufficiently subdued my very\nwakeful critical faculty. But this I at this period found a great\ndifficulty in doing, and it was not till much later that I was able to\nwatch the effect of this influence upon myself and learn something of\nits mode of action.\nAnd now, in referring to my own experiences, if my remarks appear\nto be egotistic and centre rather much in myself, this, I beg to say,\nis due rather to the nature of my topic than to any desire on my part\nthat it should be so. Being ever wishful to test the theory of spirit\nintervention and control, I dropped in one evening upon some friends,\nprofessed \" spiritualists \" of many years' standing, and after a little\nconversation we sat, myself, my friend and his wife, for manifestations.\nAfter about half an hour I felt a strange sensation stealing over me.\nI seemed to be undergoing a change of personality. I seemed to have,\nas it w ere, stepped aside, and some other intelligence was now controll\ning my organism. I was merely a passive spectator interested in what\nwas beiug done. My second self seemed to be a mother overflowing\nwith feelings of maternal love and solicitude for some one. The very\nfeatures of my face seemed to be changing, and I was distinctly con\nscious of assuming the look of a fond and devoted mother looking\ndown upon her child. I even inwardly smiled as I thought how ridi\nculous I must be looking, but I made no effort to resist the impulse.\nI now felt I wanted to caress and console somebody, and the impulse\nwas strong upon me to take my friend in my arms and soothe and\ncheer him. I resisted the impulse for some time, but finally yielded to\nit. In doing so, I had a distinct feeling of relationship to my friend.\nAfter a little while I became myself again. My friend was confident\nthat I had been influenced by the spirit of his dead mother, as he had\nhad a distinct impression of her presence at the time, which very\nprobably accounts for the feeling of relationship I experienced, as well\nas for my impersonation of the maternal character. I shall show\npresently how very susceptible I became, under like conditions, to all\nkinds of suggestion ; and if this fact be taken into consideration here,\nI think it will adequately account for what took place without resort\ning to my friend's hypothesis.\n\fPnyciticiU Phenoniemi Beariny upon Spirit Control. 311\nHowever, I am bound to state as against this view that I after\nwards learnt that he was in trouble and worry over his business, and\nwas in need of cheering and encouragement ; and that, moreover, a few\nmonths later, a terrible calamity overtook him in the loss of two of\nhis children by drowning. The effect of this experience upon myself\nw,s very curious too. For the rest of that evening and most of the\nnext day I experienced a most delightful sense of rest and content\nment, and a feeling of relief from the strain and worry of life, as if\nsomrbody else had taken the burden off my shoulders on to his own.\nThe night following this, I accepted an invitation tc be present at\na sitting held at the home of another believer in spiritism. This\ngentleman's wife is mediumistic to a mild degree She sat\napart by herself, and the husband and I sat at a small table.\nPresently, after a little singing which closed with the hymn\n\" Nearer, my God, to Thee,\" she asked me if any relative of mine had\ndied from lung trouble, as she was suddenly experiencing a great\ndifficulty and pain in breathing. She was sure, she said, that this\nunusual impression was due to my presence among them. At first I\ncould remember no one belonging to me who had died or suffered\nfrom lung trouble ; though, as a matter of fact, my father had\nactually died from bronchitis and pleurisy some twenty years before.\nMy memory had gone back rather to my mother who had died since,\nbut from quite another cause. I mentioned the cause of my mother's\ndeath and asked her if she thought it referred to that. But no, it\nwas not that ; \" it was somebody who had passed away with lung\ntrouble.\" I now suddenly remembered my father's death and its\nMuse, and acknowledged to her that my father had died from lung\ntrouble. At this she, or rather (as she expressed it), the influence\nwhich she called my father, manifested satisfaction ; from which she\ninferred that he was pleased to be recognised. I remembered too,\nnow, and noted as a curious coincidence, which may or may not mean\nanything, that the hymn we had been singing when the impression\ncame upon her, viz., \" Nearer, my God, to Thee,' had been a great\nfavourite with him. I mention this fact because at every subse\nquent meeting, the singing of this hymn always produced in her when\nwe were both present together the same sensations ; and because of\nthe suggestive influence it had later upon myself.\nMy friends, of course, claimed that this occurrence was irrefragable\nevidence of spirit manifestation ; but though there was some appear\nance of ground for their claim, I was still unable to regard what had\noccurred as in any sense a satisfactory proof of spirit communion, or of\nthe persistence of my father's personality, and still less can I do so to\nday 1 may add that I learnt through the medium that I was an object\nof special care to my father, who was always actively overlooking my\n\f312 Charles Hill Tout.\nwelfare and interests, and I received answers more or less satisfactory\nto a number of questions I put with regard to future movements on\nmy part. But as the medium could only answer in the form of \"yes \"\nand \" no,\" somewhat after the fashion of the table, I could not\nregard this as very important or conclusive.\nA little time after this, at meetings where I met a greater number\nof sitters, I began to manifest a phase of mediumship myself, or so the\nsitters regarded it. I should also say that every medium I had so far\nmet had always informed me that I possessed mediumistic powers.\nOn one occasion a public medium of the Mrs. Piper type singled me\nout from a mixed audience as a person of peculiarly mediumistic\ntemperament, stating that she saw me surrounded by a luminous\nhaze, which she interpreted as marking in me a particular phase of\nmediumship. What this phase was 1 have now forgotton. I merely\nmention the fact for what it is worth, and as possibly explaining, in\npart, the events which happened later.\nAt one of these larger sittings, after the table had rapped out\nanswers to a series of questions put to it, confirming in part, and\ncontradicting in other instances, what we had been told on previous\noccasions, the movement in the table began to subside, and the\ninfluence began to centre in me. I may say here that this has been\nmy unvarying experience throughout the whole course of my observa\ntions, that while the table is rapping out answers no one sitting at it\nis affected or influenced ; although those of impressionable tempera\nment are liable at any moment, when the interest in the questions\nand answers flags, to find the power centering in themselves.\nOn this particular occasion I was affected to an unusual degree,\nexperiencing violent twitchings in my limbs, and sensations of\npainful chilliness that made my teeth chatter again. I sat, as I\nalways did now, passively waiting for what might transpire. All\nsorts of impulses seemed to be moving me, and I noticed how\nsusceptible I was becoming to the slightest, even half-realised\nsuggestion offered by the course of my own thoughts, or by the chance\nremarks made by the other sitters. I presently felt myself being\ndrawn, as it seemed to me, towards the floor on the left side of my\nchair. I yielded to the influence and fell prostrate out of my chair on\nto the floor with considerable force ; and though the others thought I\nmust have hurt myself, I certainly felt no inconvenience from the fall.\nI lay groaning for a little while and then got up and sat in my chair\nagain.\nSome one now suggested that we should sing, and this being done,\nI immediately became affected by the music, which moved uie in a\nvery extraordinary manner. I fancied myself realising the whole\nscene clearly ;\u2014in a great cathedral I seemed to be the presiding priest\n\fPsychical Phenomena Bearing upon Spirit Control. 313\nAt the close of a great function pronouncing the benediction. I\nappeared to be looking down from a great height upon the congrega\ntion and, lifting my hands, I went through the form of blessing them.\nIt w ill be observed in all these phases or states that I seemed to be\ntwo individuals,\u2014 one my ordinary, critical, observant self, closely\nwatching what took place in and around me, the other the character\nthat seemed to be personating itself through me. Presently^with a\nchange in the music, the scene changed and I now became an operatic\nsinger. I sing tenor a little, but am not, strictly speaking, a musical\nperson. But now I seemed to have a perfect control and mastery\nover my voice, and I sang with impassioned tones several notes above\nmy normal compass pleading and gesticulating to some invisible but\nfelt female presence iu the air above me. I have no recollection of\nthe words I uttered, I was carried away and intoxicated with the\npassion I felt. I stretched my arms aloft, invoking the presence\nI felt, but could not realise, above me. There were moments\nduring this phase when I lost consciousness of myself and surround\nings.\nThe singing of the others ceasing, the scene again abruptly\nchanged. I say abruptly, for this exactly expresses the suddenness o.\nthe change. In going over the events of this evening the next day\nI was struck with this, and being familiar with the abrupt changes some\ntime produced in the hypnotic by the varying suggestions of his operator,\naccounted for my own sudden change of character in the same way.\nAnd I do not doubt that, of the dozen or more personalities I\ncharacterised that night, every one was due to a suggestion of my own\nmind, or to something in my immediate environment.\nBut to proceed. After what I have described took place, some one\nsuggested more music, as the influence seemed to work upon me better\nunder music, and the hymn \" Nearer, my God, to Thee \" was started.\nBefore the first verse was finished, I began to experience strange sen\nsations. I stood up and began to sway to and fro, and soon lost all\nsense of my surroundings. I seemed to be far away in space. The\nfeelings of distance and remoteness from all other beings were very\nmarked, and a sense of coldness and loneliness oppressed me terribly.\nI seemed to be moving, or rather to be drawn downward, and presently\nfelt that I had reached this earth again ; but all was strange and\nfearful and lonely, and I seemed to be disappointed that I could not\nattain the object of this long and lonely journey. I felt I was looking\nfor some one, but did not seem to have a clear notion of whom it was, and\nas the hopelessness of ray search and the fruitlessness of my long journey\nforced itself upon me, I cried out in my wretchedness and misery. I\nfelt I could neither find what I wanted nor get back from whence I\nhad come. My grief was very terrible, and I should have fallen to the\n\f314 Charles Hill Tout.\nground but that the other sitters had gathered round me, and some\nof them held my hands.\nJust at this moment, the lady who had experienced the oppression\non her lungs at the first singing of this hymn, made the remark,\nwhich I remember to have overheard, \" It's his father controlling him,\"\nand I then seemed to realise who I was and whom I was seeking. I\nbegan to be distressed in my lungs and should again have fallen, if\nthey had not held me by the hands and let me back gently upon the\nfloor. As my head sunk back upon the carpet, I experienced dreadful\ndistress in my lungs and could not breathe. I made signs to them to\nput something under my head. They immediately put the sofa\ncushions under me, but this was not sufficient,\u2014I was not raised\nhigh enough yet to breath easily, and they then added a pillow. I\nhave the most distinct recollection of the sigh of relief I now gave as\nI sank back like a sick, weak person upon the cool pillow.\nI was in a measure still conscious of my actions, though not of my\nsurroundings, and I have a clear memory of seeing myself in the\ncharacter of my dying father lying in the bed and the room in which\nhe died. It was a most curious sensation. I saw his shrunken hands\nand face, and lived again through his dying moments ; only now I\nwas both myself,\u2014in some indistinct sort of way,\u2014and my father,\nwith his feelings and appearance.\nPresently the sense of loneliness came over me again. I seemed\nto be all alone, and wanted and cried out for my son, that is for\nmyself. I continued in great distress, though the others assured me\nthat my son was there present. I suppose the suggestion took effect,\nas I presently seemed to be holding and fondling myself as the son I\ncame to speak with. I seemed to be at the same time both my\nfather and myself, his son. We communed together and comforted\neach other, and all the little misunderstandings of the old days were\nmade clear ; and I made him understand that as a man and a father\nmyself, I was now better able to appreciate his attitude towards n-e\nin the past. As a boy, I had always regarded him as very harsh and\nhad no warm feelings for him, and it seemed as if the knowledge on\nhis part of this fact had made him restless and unhappy ever since\nhis death, and had, through the singing of this favourite hymn of\nhis, brought him back to this sphere again. After this I presently\ncame to myself and got up again, and in a little while readily\nassumed or impersonated several other characters before the meeting\nbroke up.\nWith regard to this strange impersonation of my father in his\ndying moments, I think the suggestion made through the remark I\noverheard, that it was my father controlling me,\u2014coupled with the\nprior suggestion conveyed through the singing of the hymn which\n\fP&ychimi Phenomena Bearing upon Spirit Control. 315\nhad now become associated in my mind with my father's personality,\u2014\nsufficiently and convincingly accounts for all that took place, without\ncalling in the actual presence of my father's spirit self. The peculiar\nmanner in which the details of the scene worked themselves out I can\nfully account for in my own mind. The peculiar feelings of loneliness,\nthe chilly vastness, the tracklessness of the surrounding space, and the\nfact that I could not find the object of my search, together with the\nsense of the hopelessness, the uselessness of my efforts,\u2014all sprang\nfrom a story I had heard read aloud many years ago, and which took\na great hold upon my imagination. It was a ghost story from the\nghost's point of view, and told of the return of a restless spirit to the\nearth and to the scenes of its former existence ; the strangeness and\nintense disappointment it felt at not being able to make itself known\nto the loved ones of its past life, &c., itc.\nThe other details relating to the imaginary conversation are also\nwhat would be likely to take place if such a thing as my father's\nreturn in spirit were possible, and therefore what would most likely\ntake place if I could be made to believe he were present with me.\nFor often of late years, when I have felt that my children misunder\nstood the motives which prompted certain conduct on my part towards\nthem, my thoughts have involuntarily gone back to my own youth and\ntraining, and I have frequently longed that my father might be alive,\nthat I might make him feel that I understood and appreciated him\nbetter now and would gladly seek his advice and counsel in the\ntraining of my own children. And in the same way I might, if it\nwere needful, adequately account for all the salient features of the\nother impersonations.\nWhile seeking in no way\u2014in thus accounting for these experiences\nof mine by the natural workings of my own subconscious self\u2014to\ndeny that we may under certain conditions and circumstances be\ninfluenced by intelligences outside ourselves, I cannot admit that my\nown experience, at any rate, is to be accounted for in this manner.\nI know myself\u2014and my susceptibility, even under normal conditions,\nto suggestion in all sorts of forms, not necessarily verbal,\u2014so well\nthat no alternative remains to me but to believe that what I did was\ndne simply to every-day suggestion in one form and another. Building\nand peopling chateaux en Espagne was a favourite occupation of mine\nin my earlier days, and this long-practised faculty is doubtless a\npotent factor in all my characterisations, and probably also in those of\nmany another full-fledged \" medium.\" At any rate I hope I have\nmade it clear that before we can admit that phenomena such as I have\ndescribed are due to the influence or presence of disembodied spirits,\nthat is, discarnate men\u2014as is commonly done,\u2014the personal equation\nthat here manifests itself so strongly under the dramatising faculty\n\f316 Charles Hill Tout.\nwhich we all possess in a much greater degree than is commonly sup\nposed, and which is very active in strongly imaginative temperaments\nsuch as mine, must be eliminated. And when this is intelligently and\nrigorously done, I venture to think that a very large proportion of\ncases now attributed to spirit control will be adequately explained\nwithout resorting to any such occult agency.\nIn conclusion, let me say that I have not written this hurried and\nfragmentary account of my experiences to establish any theory of my\nown, or to run a tilt against over credulous spiritists. My purpose has\nbeen simply to point out how liable we are in these as in other\nmatters to be the victims of self-deception ; and how guardedly and\ncritically we should receive all evidence of this kind. So strongly do\nI feel in this matter myself that I would personally refuse to accept\nphenomena of a vastly more startling nature than any that have come\nunder my observation or that I have experienced as, in any sense, evi\ndence of spirit control, unless the whole character and antecedents of\nthe medium were thoroughly known and were such as to render an\nexplanation of the kind I have given wholly inadmissible and out of\nplace. And as it is of the very essence of mediumship ex hypothesi\nthat it be impressionable and therefore readily open to suggestion, I do\nnot see that we can ever hope to obtain evidence not open to these\nobjections and, therefore, evidence that we can accept and rely upon.\n\fsupplement.) Subliminal Self or Unconscious Cerebration I 317\nSUBLIMINAL SELF OR UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION?\nHaving had occasion recently to examine some of the literature connected\nwith the subject of \"multiple consciousness,\" the writer discovered that, as the\nreading advanced, his opinions were undergoing a complete transformation.\nStarting with the prepossession that \"double consciousness\" was a well\nattested fact, and that a \"secondary consciousness \" was a necessary assump\ntion for the satisfactory explanation of many curious facts of a morbid\npsychological nature, there came gradually the inclination to adopt a more\nphysiological and, in the writer's opinion, a more consistent view. At a time\nwhen such books as those of Janet 1 and Binet,J and such articles as those\nof Myers5 are giving widespread currency to the notions of \"secondary''\nand \"subliminal \" consciousnesses, it may not be amiss to approach the subject\nfrom a somewhat antagonistic standpoint, and to offer a mild protest against\nthe too hasty adoption of such momentous doctrines. There are many facts\nthat seem to militate very strongly against all those theories that have for\ntheir fundamental claim the existence of a subliminal, split-off, parasitic,\nsecondary consciousness. Three reasons for rejecting these theories may\nperhaps be worthy of consideration.\nI. The assumption of a secondary consciousness is unnecessary. This\nhypothesis has arisen in great part from a study of the curious phenomena of\nhysteria, and is founded upon the belief that outside of the normal, primary\nconsciousness there exist separate sensations, separate images, and separate\nmemories, for which it is considered necessary to posit another consciousness.\nThe belief in these sensations, images, and memories is grounded principally\nin the notion of pseudo-amesthesias, and in the notion that complex move\nments cannot be produced without accompanying motor images. In hysteria\nansesthesias and complex movements are found, which are not under the\njurisdiction of the primary consciousness. Consequently the hysteric has a\nsecondary bit of consciousness which contains these rejected sensations and\nmotor images. Such in its simplest form is the argument of the French\n1 Pierre Janet.\u2014VAutomatismc Psychologique. Also Etat Mental da Hvstiriques,\nVols. I. and II., 1892-3.\n2 A. Binet.\u2014Let Alterations de la Pertonnaliti.\n*F. W. H. Myers\u2014Proceedings, S.P.R., February, July.and December, 1892.\nI.\n2 B\n\f318 ISupplement.\nArthur H. Pierce.\nwriters. Standing alone it may mean one of two things. It may mean that\nconscious motor images are necessary for the production of movements and\nthat complex acts require a guiding consciousness,\u2014that is, it may mean that\nconsciousness stands in causal relation to motor processes ; or it may simply\nmean that these odd phenomena of hysteria are such as would naturally be\naccompanied by consciousness, the latter being called secondary in these cases\nbecause it does not belong to the normal consciousness of the subject. In a\nword, the argument in favour of a secondary consciousness may rest upon a\nbelief in the causal efficacy of consciousness, or it may rest upon mere\nanalogy. Without discussing the particular point of view, however, that\nindividual writers take, and without entering into any consideration of\nparticular theories such as that of psycho-physical parallelism, believers in\nwhich are perhaps less apt to speak of consciousness as necessarily present in\nthe initiating and guiding of movements,\u2014leaving all this aside, one can at\nleast say that all writers upon the subject of secondary consciousness seem\nutterly to forget the well known experiments upon frogs and pigeons that\nhave been repeated time and time again in physiological laboratories. These\nanimals, when deprived of their hemispheres, will swim or fly, as the case\nmay be, will avoid obstacles, regain their normal position if placed upon\ntheir backs, eat if food be put into their mouths, in short will perform all or\nnearly all their normal acts if only the appropriate stimuli be applied. Here\nwe have acts of considerable complexity with nothing but the lower nervous\ncentres to control them. But there is one all-important condition for these\nacts of frogs and pigeons. The appropriate stimuli must be applied, for no\nact is spontaneous. The movements of the hysteric which are ascribed to the\nsecondary consciousness are of this type exactly. All the movements of\nadaptation to a pair of scissors or to a dynamometer placed in the hand, and\nall the movements in automatic writing are simply responses to appropriate\nstimuli, responses that are no more complex for man than are swimming and\nflying for frogs and pigeons. So that even if a consciousness be really\nefficient in directing movements, it is superfluous to invoke it for such\nphenomena as hysteria presents.\nII.\u2014The second consideration for abandoning the theory is that, if\nconsistently held, it must be pushed to a point of absurdity. In his \" Das\nDoppel-Ich,\"1 Dessoir makes the following statement, \"In the course of\nordinary life certain actions occur which presuppose for their origination all\nthe faculties of the human spirit, but which, nevertheless, work themselves\nout without the knowledge of the agent. These actions we term automatic.\nAmong them are certain automatic movements, as the act of dressing\noneself, or of retracing a well known path ; and some other automatic\nperformances, such as counting one's steps, or adding up columns of figures.\nThese latter acts plainly indicate the existence of a separate train of\nmemory employed upon them. And, moreover, although they take place\nwithout the agent's knowledge, they cannot take place without his conscious\nness; they cannot be truly unconscious acts. They must in some fashion\nbelong to a sub-consciousness which, in relation to the far more potent njtper\nconsciousness may best be understood if we consider it as a secondary\n1 Max Dessoir -Das Doppel-Ich. Leipzig, 1890.\n\fsupplement.) Subliminal Self or Unconscious Cerebration .' 319\nconsciousness. And if we regard consciousness and memory as the essential\nconstituents of an Ego, we may boldly Ray that every man conceals within\nhimself the germs of a second personality.\"1\nAll my automatic acts then, are, when the whole story is told, acts that\nWong to a subordinate consciousness. I am, then, constantly attended by\na personality. No. 2, who watches over me and attends to many of my\npersonal matters like a faithful valet. After a short season of preliminary\ninstruction, he learns to oversee the operations sometimes wrongly called\nmechanical, such as walking, dressing, avoiding objects in my way, swallow\ning, coughing, etc. It is he who thrusts my hands into my Ilocket8,\nand causes me to blush when I become embarrassed. His is the blame for\nany sudden fit of uncontrollable awkwardness, and to him may often be\nascribed the responsibility for \"the things that were better left unsaid.\" It\nis he that revels in my dreams, that raves in my fevers, and sometimes\nbecomes inconveniently communicative and shamelessly reveals secrets that\nhare been whispered to him by individual No. 1. All the acts of my body\nthat are not consciously governed by my personal consciousness are under\nthe supervision of No. 2. In short, if this theory of a secondary conscious\nness be made to do its full duty, the doctrine that habits are due to well-\nworn nervous paths must be abandoned, and all the phenomena now\ncommonly ascribed to habit must be classed under the head of relegation*\nto a tecowlary consciousness. Such a conclusion is not merely unnecessary,\nit is mythical and fantastic to a point of absurdity.\nOnce more, consider for a moment the implication of Myers' theory of a\n\"subliminal\" consciousness. Those who are familiar with his articles will\nremember his simile of the spectrum, the ultra red portion representing the\nconsciousness that attends the physiological functions, and the ultra-violet\nend representing that consciousness from which come the inspirations of\ngenius.2 Here we have the secondary consciousness divided into two parts.\nWhat is to hinder the sub-division of each of these parts ? If we go the full\nlength of the theory, must we not posit a consciousness for every physical\nprocess? Must not the digestive organs, the heart, the lungs, the\nmechanism ofjjlocomotion have each its own special overseer 1 And if once\nwe begin this process of sub-division, where are we to stop? \"Few,\"\nDeesoir says, \"have entered the lists in defence of the multiplicity of the\nEgo.\" Were we to keep going down, positing more and more layers of\nconsciousness, \" we should arrive at a kind of onion-structure of the Soul !\"\nTo be sure we should, but double consciousness cannot stop with its own\nassumption. Consistency demands that the Subliminal Self be divided into\nnumerous other tiny Selves, whose sum, together with the little primary Self,\nmakes up the entire individual.. I myself, then, am but a homunculus\namong homunculi, and why the particular homunculus that I call myself\nshould be such as he is, and not one of the subliminal fellows, that remains\na total and inscrutable mystery. Without saying it in so many words,\nMyers practically admits all this. But this is worse psychologizing than an\nunconditional return to the old doctrine of Faculties.\n1 See Proceeding!, S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 207.\n> Mjers-Proceedings, S.P.R., VII.. XX., p. 328.\n2 b 2\n\f320 ISupplement.\nArthur H. Pierce.\nIII.\u2014A third reason for rejecting the theory under discussion is that\nwe have not a particle of direct testimony for the existence of a split-off\nconsciousness. You will retort that we have no direct evidence for the\nexistence of any consciousness not our own, and I should at once assent,\nbecause all of our reasoning in regard to another's consciousness is by\nanalogy solely. But there is one point that needs to be noted. Assent to\nthe theory of secondary consciousness has been unipjestionably facilitated by\nthe notion that we are all in possession of a dream-consciousness that is\nseparate from our waking consciousness. And we draw this conclusion not\nso much from the observation of the dreams and petty somnambulisms of\nothers, as from the often observed fact that the imaged events of one dream\nwill recur in another dream, though they be forgotten during waking\nmoments. This thought seems to establish conclusively the proof of a\ndistinct dream-consciousness. But a moment's careful thought will im\nmediately disclose the incontestible fact, that the recurrence in dreams of\nidentical pictures peculiar to the dreams could never have been established and\nwould probably never have been conceived, had not the fact of recurrence\nbeen present in the primary consciousness of the individual. And of the fact\nof recurrence there could never have been the faintest inkling, had it not been\nthat the events which recurred were known to consciousness No. 1. The\ndream-consciousness is only the normal consciousness working under peculiar\nconditions. Many dreams, I feel confident, are never attended by any\nconsciousness whatsoever. They are then, strictly speaking, not dreams at\nall, although to an observer all the outward manifestations of a dream are\npresent. But a consciousness cannot be inferred. It must be testified to\nby the individual himself. And so far as I know, no secondary consciousness\nhas ever left in any automatically written record any claim to self-conscious\nness, or any indefeasible testimony in support of its own recognised\nexistence. The whole conception is pure assumption. For no primary\nconsciousness can ever bear witness to the existence of a secondary,\ndissociated fragment of consciousness. If it ever attempt to give such\ntestimony, it thereby proves that the fragment is a portion of itself and\ntherefore no fragment at all.\nNor have those statements any value that are made by persons who\naffirm that they are composed of two distinct selves, one of which does\nthings that the other condemns. What such persons are talking about is.\nsimply the one primary self under two different and somewhat contradictory\naspects. Any testimony from oneself that one is double is the very best\npossible proof that one is not double. In like manner those who claim that\nthey are possessed or are under some foreign control, either refer to various\ncontradictory phases of their one self, or show that some of their acts that\nare usually voluntary occur without the presence in consciousness of the\nappropriate accompanying motor images. There is no direct evidence for a\nsecondary consciousness, and indirect evidence in such a case as this should,\nit seems to me, be looked upon with suspicion. We have no right to assert\nthat a given set' of muscular movements is accompanied by a consciousness,\nmerely because it is of a kind that with us is so accompanied. Reasoning by\nanalogy may sometimes overstep its bounds.\nAccordingly, I am compelled to reject the theory of a secondary\n\fsoppicment.1 Subliminal Self or Unconscious Cerebration? 321\nconsciousness for the three reasons given,\u2014because the supposition is\nunnecessary to explain the facts ; because it must be pushed to a point of\nabsurdity if consistently held ; anil because there is not the slightest direct\nevidence for the existence of the kind of consciousness in question. All the\nfacts usually taken in support of a double consciousness theory appear\nexplicable in terms of brain alone. The brain-explanation may seem un\nsatisfactory to many, but at least it is the less mythical explanation, and\nsurely it is fully as simple, in that it confines the difficulty wholly to the\nphysical side. Let me state as well as I can the physical explanation for the\nvarious cases of ordinary alternating, or changing personality, as well as for\nthose cases in which two or more separate consciousnesses are supposed to\nexist simultaneously. We will consider the latter first.\nIn all the abnormalities of hysteria, for which Janet and the rest see tit\nto assume a second consciousness, the state of the matter seems to me to be\nsimply this,\u2014certain cerebral cells and cortical paths have in some way\nbecome clogged, with the result that the nervous tensions, and the force and\nrapidity of discharge consequent upon these tensions, have been reduced to a\npoint far below the normal. These cortical processes are unable to reach\nthat degree of excitation that is requisite for consciousness. Every one\nadmits that an excitation below a certain limit fails to be attended by\nconsciousness, though the reason for such a fact is still lacking. The normal\nconsciousness therefore becomes contracted, as Janet so often says. The\nnst of the co1iscious1iess has timply evaporated. If 1 may be permitted to use\nsuch a grotesque figure, consciousness may be compared to a mass of steam\nfloating over a brain whose cortex is in a high state of nervous tension and\nactivity. Let certain portions of the cortical area \"cool down\" and the\nsteam disappears from over those areas. Now this is exactly what happens\nin hysteria. Certain brain-areas become so clogged that the requisite\namount of \"heat\" cannot be maintained, and lo! the vapoury consciousness\nvanishes. Could these chilled areas once be \" warmed up \" again, conscious\nness would return. And we find plenty of evidence that this often happens.\nThe hysterical aniethesias vastly diminish in states of intoxication, whether\nfrom alcohol, chloroform, or morphine they often disappear wholly during\nan attack, which surely is a nervous commotion sufficient to arouse any\ndormant brain-tract ; electricity diminishes them ; and if the attention of\nthe patient be called to the amesthetic part by directing her to look\nat a coloured wafer placed upon it, pinching of the part will be felt for some\ntime afterwards,\u2014and what is \"calling the attention to the part\" but a\nmethod for rendering more intense the nervous process in the tactile regions\nof the cortex. The aboulias, as well as the amethesias, disappear in ether or\nalcohol intoxication.2 Patients find it much more easy to voluntarily per\nform old and habitual acts than those newly-acquired ; which is only another\nway of saying that well-worn cortical paths can be raised to the conscious\nness-point of excitation much more readily than paths that still offer\nresistance by reason of their newness. If the cortex could be kept con\nstantly at a red heat, consciousness would be as extensive as in any normal\n1 Janet.\u2014Etat Mental, ett., Vol. I., p. 20.\n5 Janet.\u2014Loc. cit., Vol. I., p. 144.\n\f322 ISupplement.\nArthur H. Pierce.\nindividual. But disease has occasioned too much resistance for that. Several\nconsiderations will serve to illustrate the clogging and consequent imper-\nviousness of paths. In the so-called stage of intellectual aboulia the patient\nhas a feeling of unfamiliarity with everything ; all things appear as if in a\ndream ; the subject is not wholly sure whether a book is a book, is not abso\nlutely certain that a brother is really recognised as a brother, etc.1 That is, the\nnervous process is so weak that the usual paths of association are not opened,\nand the experience has none of that feeling of \"warmth and intimacy\" that\nin normal life constitutes the fact of recognition. Again, a subject who would\nnormally require twenty minutes for the execution of such a simple act as\ntaking a hat from a table and hanging it upon a peg, will perform the act\nimmediately under the influence of a post-hypnotic suggestion. At a given\nrap upon the table she takes the hat and hangs it up. The hypnotic\nsuggestion has opened the necessary paths, and the act can be performed\nquickly. But, further, if she be interrupted in the midst of the act and\nasked what she is doing, she replies\u2014\" I ? I am doing nothing.\"\u2014 \" But you\nhave just taken tho hat.\"\u2014\" No, it is not I.\" The subject thinks that it is\nnot she who does the act, because the usual normal complex of associated\npaths that corresponds to what we term the reasons for an act is wanting.\nThe very elements that compose the feeling of self-origination are lacking,\nfor if one knows no reasons for an act, how can one think that the act is\none's own ? Paths are everywhere blocked. Only a few can be open simul\ntaneously. The greater part of consciousness is consequently suppressed.\nOnce more, the hysterical amnesias are no more wonderful than the\nsimilar experiences that we ourselves have when we are about to fall into the\nunconsciousness of sleep. Not long ago, as I was on the point of falling\nasleep, a train of thought, apparently of some significance, ran through my\nmind and immediately vanished, leaving no trace beyond the faint recollec\ntion that something had been there. Had it not been for the psychological\ninterest of the matter, the fact even of the vanished thoughts might never\nhave been noticed. The whole life of the hysteric is made up of experiences\nof this kind. Impressions, of whatever sort they may be, leave such faint\ntraces behind them that the paths of association lie unopened or dormant,\nuntil forced open by some unusually violent nervous commotion like the\nattack. Then the amnesias vanish, and for a moment the field of conscious\nness enlarges.\nThus the amount of consciousness that a hysteric possesses is constantly\nvarying, fluctuating at the times of an attack from almost nothing to the\nnormal amount. The fluctuations of the anajsthesias, amnesias, and powers\nof voluntary movement ; the peculiar phenomena of the paralyses, the con\ntractures and the attacks; in a word all the \"bizarreries\" that are the\ncommonplaces of the hysteric's life can be understood and accounted for on\nno other hypothesis than the one that makes them cerebral and not mental\nphenomena. To the poor hysteric herself, to be sure, they must appear\nunder the form of continual fluctuations in the field of consciousness, from a.\nstate of normal life to that state in which the residual consciousness\nis extremely minute. But to the observer and describer they must ever\n1 Janet.\u2014Loc. ait., Vol. I., p. 141.\n\fsappiement.i Subliminal Self or Unconscious Cerebration? 323\nappear as phenomena of brain and nervous system,\u2014phenomena due to one\nof the most subtle of nervous diseases.\nBut, one objects, does not the awesthetic hand of the hysteric have a\nmemory of its own ? Does it not repeat acts that it is first made to perform?\nDoes it nut show by its automatic writing that the events of weeks ago are\nremembered ! And does not this memory, then, show the existence of a con\nsciousness of which it is a part ? I would reply that in the true sense of the\nword there is no memory here at all. There is nothing but the recurrence of\nformer discharges, a second edition of previous acts. There is no more\nmemory present than in the well-seasoned, time-mellowed violin, which\nresponds to the bow by vibrating in the same old waves and nodes that\nhundreds of previous bowings have firmly established. If this can be called\nmemory, then the pranks of the hysteric's antesthetic hand may also be ho\noiled. And if counting and adding are to be made proofs of a consciousness,\nI can only say that machines will add with marvellous accuracy, and that\ntrork-horses have been known to start for home when a definito number of\nluads have been carried.\nThese changes in the consciousness and the personality of the hysterics\ncan be best understood by keeping in mind the thesis so ably maintained by\nRibot in his Diseases of Personality. According to him, what we mean by\npersonality, psychologically speaking, is but a complex of memories and\nbal'ly sensations. If now these bodily sensations be changed or diminished,\nthere is lost the very thing upon which the consciousness of personal identity\nrests. Now the hysteric has lost many of her bodily sensations. What\nhappens over a good part of the body is often not reported to consciousness\n*t all. But let all the bodily sensations be restored, as in the deep somnam\nbulism, and the patient is her true self again. The trouble lies probably in\nthe kinesthetic regions of the cortex.1 This conception of trouble in the\nkinesthetic areas, of such a kind that the consciousness-point of excitation\ncannot usually be reached, helps also to clear up the phenomena which are\nclassed under the head of co-operations of the two consciousnesses.2 E.g.,\nthe hand is pricked three times and the subject sees or thinks of the number\nthree. That is, the paths of association to the visual or other sensory\ncentres are open, and these centres, in consequence of their excitation, are\naccompanied by consciousness. All the facts of \" co-operation \" can be thus\nexplained.\nWhen the two consciousnesses conflict, as in the \"parasitic cases,\"3 the\nstate of the matter is, probably, that certain groups of cells have in some\nway become dissociated in part, so that they cannot properly discharge. Their\nconstant struggle to discharge constitutes the annoyance, the harassing\n\" irruptions of the secondary consciousness. \" Some violent emotion opens up\npaths, allows the discharge to take place, and sets everything right again.\nThis seems to me a more simple explanation than to say, as the writers\nreferred to in the foot-note do say, that two consciousnesses become recon-\n1 See H. C. Bastian's Hysterical or Functional Paralysis.\n:Binet.\u2014Loc. cit., p. 173.\n'See article by Breuer and Freud in Neurologisches Centralblatt, January, 1893.\nAlso Janet, hoe. at.. Vol. II , pp. 65 and 242.\n\f324 ISupplement.\nArthur H. Pierce.\nciled. How weeping and cursing can reconcile two consciousnesses, I fail\nto see ; but that they could be effective in opening up clogged paths I can\neasily understand.\nWhat has been said in regard to hysteria may be said equally well in\nregard to dreams, automatic writing, mediumistic possession, &c., &c. Old\nand familiar paths are discharging in a subdued way, and the acts are reflex\nand unconscious. In fact all those phenomena that are commonly supposed\nto furnish evidence in favour of a secondary consciousness, really present the\nmost convincing illustrations of the fact that acts of the most complex kind\ncan go on without the aid of an accompanying consciousness. With respect\nto hysteria, it may indeed be true that it can be most conveniently diagnosed\nas a mental disorder, for the facts in consciousness are here more accessible\nthan the regions of the cortex. But to diagnose hysteria as a mental disease,\nand to consider it a mental trouble which produces physical disorders, are\ntwo widely different things.\nIn some such way as this, the weakness of the theories that postulate two\nco-existing consciousnesses may be shown. What now can be said of those\nfamiliar cases of alternating personality for which Mary Reynolds1 and\nAnsel Bourne2 may be taken as types ? It is true that we have here two\nsoparate personalities, but one is not secondary to the other except in point\nof time. When either one exists, it is for the time primary consciousness,\nthe whole personality. Each has its own period of complete sway, and\nmeanwhile the other has ceased to be. By some strange process there have\narisen two sundered sets of associations, each of which represents a self. But\nit is not under the form of associations in consciousness that these two sets\nhave become sundered. The separation is a brain-fact entirely, \u2014a brain-\nfact that finds its counterpart in the fluctuating changes of consciousness.\nExactly what this brain-fact is I am of course unable to state ; but the\ngeneral explanation seems to lie in the notion of cortical cloggings, partial or\nentire, cloggings of such a kind that currents may still pass, though with\nenfeebled power, as electric currents pass with greater difficulty through a\nsmaller wire ; or cloggings that may wholly bar the passage of all ordinary\ncurrents and may thus switch them off in new directions. Of one thing,\nhowever, there seems to be some evidence, namely, that although some new\nportions of the cerebral structure must be used for the new sets of associa\ntions, each of the alternating personalties does not correspond to absolutely\ndistinct brain-areas. Mary Reynolds, after falling into her second state, waa\nobliged to re-learn the arts of reading and writing, but \"she made such\nrapid progress in both that in a few tceeks she had readily relearned to read\nand write,\" and, the account adds, \"when we consider the length of time\nrequired to teach a child these arts, her almost intuitive readiness appears\nwonderful.\" The simple and prosaic truth is that certain identical brain-\npaths were employed in the second as in the first state. In the beginning of\nthe second state they were doubtless obstructed or disconnected, but the new\nefforts at learning cleared them out, or established the proper connections, and\nthereafter they functioned correctly. Ribot states that no cases are known\n1 Transactions of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, April 4, 1888,\nabstracted in Prof. James' Psychology, Vol. I., p. 381.\n2 Prof. James' Psychology, Vol. I., p. 391.\n\fsupplement.) Subliminal Self or Unconscious Cerebration? 325\nto him where the second personality has not inherited at least some small\nshare of the effects of its predecessor ; and from what has just been said the\nreason is clear. Ansel Bourne's second self,\u2014the Brown personality,\u2014was,\naccording to Professor James, \"nothing but a rather shrunken, dejected and\namnesic extract of Mr. Bourne himself.\"\nIn the cases of progressive, or developing personalities, like those of Dr.\nAram's Felida X. and Janet's Lucie and Leonie, the successive personalities,\neach larger than and including the others, seem to be due to the successive\nremoval, through the influence of disease or hypnotism, of certain inhibi\ntions. The complex network of interlacing brain-paths is divided off some\nhow into more or less perfect systems. One system of paths remains open\nconstantly and represents the normal personality. At times a second system\nis opened up and.put into connection with the first, and this combination of\nthe two sets of paths corresponds to the second personality. Similarly\nwith the third personality, when that exists. Thus Lucie I. was anesthetic\nall over, nearly deaf and partially blind. In Lucie II. the anesthesias were\ndiminished, some inhibitions had been removed and some new paths opened ;\nwhile Lucie III. had all the inhibitions removed and was without a trace of\nansssthesia. To say that certain new sets of paths have been ojlened up\nseems vastly more simple and intelligible, vague as it may be, than to say\nthat various strata of consciousness have been brought from a state of dis\nsociation into one of harmonious union.\nLet no one suppose from the above that the writer is endeavouring to\nreduce personality to cerebral explosions, or trying to debase consciousness\nby making use of brain-hypotheses. An attempt has been made merely to\nsuggest an explanation of the facts that shall be consistent with itself ; and\nto this end the description of the phenomena has been couched in physical\nterms, with no pretence whatever to ultimate points of view where \" deeper\nrealities\" must gain recognition. For all the phenomena usually classed\nunder such heads as \"double\" and \"secondary\" consciousness, two terms\nmay be proposed,\u2014first Alternating Personalities, a term that is already for\nthe most part correctly employed ; and second, Fluctuating Consciousness,\na term that will cover all cases of developing personality, as well as all cases\nthat are supposed to be manifestations of a subliminal consciousness.\n\"Multiple consciousness,\" \"secondary consciousness,\" and the like, are terms\nthat should be abandoned. '' Two souls within one breast '' is, indeed, a\nbeautiful rhetorical figure, indispensable for poetry and religion. And so\nwere Kepler's angels a beautiful conception for the power that drives the\nplanets. But in science the metaphor must be dropped.\nArthur H. Pierce.\nII.\nIt is no doubt useful sometimes to forsake the mountain tops whereon\nthe Subliminal Self sits enthroned, and to rest for a space on the solid\nearth. For there are mists in those high regions, and the traveller who has\nlooked for a wide prospect over the kingdoms of the mind has sometimes\nfound his only reward in the strenuous joys of the ascent. Personally, I\nsm grateful to Mr. Pierce for having recalled us for a time to the\n\f326 ISupplement-\nFrank Podmore.\npurely physiological aspects of the problem\u2014aspects which our ignorance, on\nthe one hand, of the cerebral changes accompanying consciousness, and on\nthe other, the allurements of the psychological questions involved, are\nconstantly tempting us to ignore. Mr. Pierce has done good service by\nattempting to define the nature of the physical changes which correspond to\nthe mental phenomena of fluctuating and alternate consciousness. His\nphysiological explanation of the modifications in sensibility presented by\nhystero-aniesthetic subjects like Pierre Janet's Louise and Rose, is, if nut\nnovel, luminous and forcible. Probably his account of the matter is about\nas near as we can at present come to a correct view of the physical side of the\nphenomena. The metaphor of consciousness as the steam floating over the\nworkings of the brain engine, with stimuli such as alcohol or hypnotism to\nwarm up the cooled-down area and thus increase the steaming surface,\nis picturesque and helpful. And in all the latter part of his paper, when he\ndeals with the phenomena of \" Alternating Personalities,\" to each of\nwhich he allows an independent consciousness, it is difficult to find cause for\nserious disagreement. To all this M. Pierre Janet and the other French\nobservers referred to, if I have rightly understood them, and probably Mr.\nMyers also, would find themselves able to assent.\nBut why does Mr. Pierce quarrel with the attribution of consciousness to\nthese abnormal states? Consciousness is not a brain fact. And yet\nMr. Pierce throughout writes as if the physiological were an alternative to the\npsychological explanation. Take your choice, he says in effect, but you can't\nhave both. Thus, he assures us that the singular manifestations observed\nin Janet's hystero-aniesthetics, are \"cerebral, not mental phenomena.\" He\nwarns us that \" if the theory of a secondary consciousness be made to do its\nfull duty, the doctrine that habits are due to well-worn nerve paths must be\nabandoned, and all the phenomena now commonly ascribed to habit must be\nclassed under the head of relegations to a secondary consciousness.\" And\nfinally, he lays it down that all the facts usually taken in \"support of a\ndouble consciousness theory appear explicable in terms of brain alone,\" and\nthat this is \"the less mythical explanation.\" Now to the plain man\u2014the\nman who is not bound by his allegiance to some philosophical system\nto swear away any of the facts\u2014statements like these appear to involve a.\nradical misconception of the questions at issue.\nTo the plain man there is not one series of phenomena susceptible either\nof a physical or of a metaphysical explanation. There are two series of\nphenomena. The plain man calls these series respectively physical and\nmental. The mental phenomena are states of consciousness, the physical\nare brain changes\u2014Mr. Pierce's \" clogged cells, \" \"well-worn nerve paths,\"\n\" inhibited tracts,\" and so on. If we wish to go a little deeper, it may be\npointed out that the existence of both series rests upon inference. We are\ndealing with brain-changes which we never saw, nor are ever likely to see ;\nand with states of some other person's consciousness, when all that we\nreally know is states of our own. But the inferences are made and\naccepted by everyone as postulates necessary for carrying on the business f.f\nlife. Perhaps it may be that the two sets of phenomena are diverse aspects of\nthe same essential fact. But for practical purposes we have to take them as\nwe find them, as two separate and mutually exclusive series. For purposes.\n\fsupplement.I Subliminal Self or Unconscious Cerebmtion ? 327\nof scientific treatment we may, if we choose, discuss the problem from\neither the cerebral or the mental side, or from both simultaneously. We\nmay talk indifferently of \"enlargement of consciousness,\" or \"re\nvivification of dormant cerebral tracts,\" of- \" the intrusion of a secondary\nmemory,\" or \"the spasmodic functioning of a dissociated sub-cortical\ncentre.\" Probably in our present ignorance of cerebral physiology the\npsychological method is likely to be the more fruitful, and it appears, with\ndeference to Mr. Pierce, to be the simpler. But no doubt it is well to have\nboth.\nThus much isi conceded by logic and common sense. But what\nlogic and common sense do not concede is that we should treat mental\nand cerebral ^phenomena as members of that same series. The cerebral\nfact has its cerebral antecedent and its cerebral consequent. Not merely the-\nobserred facts, but the conditions of our thinking compel us to assume that the\nphysical chain, at any rate, is complete in itself, and unbroken by the\nintrusion of any fact of a different order : though we cannot always trace a\nlike continuity in the mental series. When, therefore, Mr. Pierce talks of\nabandoning well-worn nerve channels in favour of secondary consciousness ;\nwhen he asks us to accept the \" brain explanation \" as less mythical ; when\nhe writes of a mental disorder as a thinkable explanation of cerebral disease,\nhe is ignoring the rules of the game. A mental disorder cannot cause a\nphysical change : \"well-worn nerve cliannels \" are merely the hypothetical\nbrain-eiiuivaleuts (has Mr. Pierce ever seen a well-worn nerve channel, and\nwould he recognise it if he did ? ) for the workings of what Mr. Myers\ncalls the Subliminal Consciousness. The brain explanation is more \" satis\nfactory\" as an explanation of the physical facts, just as the Subliminal\nConsciousness is more satisfactory as a means of describing the mental\nphenomena. Both are alike \" mythical \" if by that is meant hypothetical.\nIn fact, we are dealing throughout with hypotheses, conventional signs of we\nknow not what underlying realities. The two sets of signs are parallel ; but\nit is a fatal blunder to interpolate a term from one series into the other. The\nart of painting and the art of writing furnish us with two series of conven\ntional signs by means of which a fact in nature- say a landscape\u2014may\nbe represented. Mr. Pierce is in the position of an artist who through the\npoverty of his technical resources should in depicting a landscape leave the\nsty unpainted, filling in the blank with a written description of the blue\nvault dappled with white clouds, and should then proceed to complain that\nthe black ink would not harmonise with the colour-scheme of his picture.\nWhat right has Mr. Pierce, on physical grounds, to object to consciousness;\nis an explanation of the psychological phenomena observed i Once more,\nconsciousness is not a brain fact. When\u2014to take his arguments seriatim \u2014\nMr. Pierce asserts that the assumption of a secondary consciousness is un\nnecessary, the question arises, unnecessary for what ? It is not necessary\u2014\nit would be ridiculous\u2014 as an explanation of physical facts. But no one, as:\nf*r as I am aware, has put it forward in that connection. Whether or not a\nsecondary consciousness may be inferred from certain phenomena, physical\nand mental, is a question with which psychologists are primarily concernedr\nsnd which cannot be solved or greatly advanced towards solution by reference,\nto reflex action and brainless frogs.\n\f328 [Supplement.\nFrank Pod\/more.\nSo again, in his second argument. To suppose that consciousness accom\npanies automatic action may or may not be absurd. It is a question, I\napprehend, to be determined by observation. But Mr. Pierce has not shown\nthat it has any bearing upon the ascription of habitual action to well-worn\nnerve paths.\nHis final argument, that there is no direct testimony to the existence of a\nsplit-off consciousness, not only betrays the same misconception, but appears\nto be based on a superficial and extremely restricted survey of the faces.\nIn the latter part of his paper, in order to meet the cases of Ansel Bourne,\nMary Reynolds, and Felida X., Mr. Pierce admits the existence of \"alter\nnating personalities,\" and \" fluctuating consciousness,\" and thus practically\nconcedes much of the matter in dispute. But in his first discussion of the sub\nject he concentrates his attention almost exclusively on tie small group of\nhystero-anesthetics described by Pierre Janet and others. Practically the\nwhole of his arguments and illustrations are drawn from these subjects.\n\" The belief,\" he says, \"in these sensations, images, and memories [outside\nthe normal cousciousness], is grounded principally in the notion of pseuuV-\nanesthesias, and in the notion that complex movements cannot be produced\nwithout accompanying motor images.\" Even to dreams and somnambulism\nhe refers only to express his conviction that \" many dreams are never\n-attended by any consciousness whatever.\" Surely we need Mr. Pierces\ndefinition of consciousness before we can discuss a statement of this kind.\nBut however narrowly Mr. Pierce would be disposed to limit the applica\ntion of \"consciousness,\" I cannot but think that if he had at the outset of\nhis enquiries taken into consideration not merely such pathological cases as\nthose of Felida X. and Ansel Bourne, but the more frequent and normal\nphenomena of the hypnotic trance, he would have modified this statement iif\nhis views. The hypnotised subject presents, or may present, \u2014 as many of\nus have seen for ourselves,\u2014all the phenomena which we associate with con\nsciousness, not merely in our own case, but in the case of the same person\nwhen in his normal state. He talks, acts, reasons ; exhibits emotion, judg\nment, volition. As has been said, the hypnotic state frequently differs from\nthe normal in no other respect than that it is different. If Madame B. is not\nconscious in the state in which she has christened herself Leontine, by what\nsigns are we to infer consciousness in others at all ? And the consciousness of\nthe hypnotic is certainly not identical with the consciousness of the waking\nstate. With rare exceptions it is more extensive ; it includes the waking\nconsciousness as a larger includes a smaller concentric circle, itself not\nincluded by it. Indeed, so much Mr. Pierce practically admits, by proposing\nthe term \"fluctuating consciousness\" for conditions like those presented by\nFelida X. and Madame B.\nComparing the admissions at the end of the article with the argument at\nthe beginning, I am led to the conclusion that what Mr. Pierce really aimed\nat refuting was, not the contention that consciousness accompanies certain\nabnormal states and certain \"automatic\" actions, but the doctrine that\nthese states and actions indicate that there are two independent centres\nof activity functioning simultaneously in the same organism\u2014in a word, the\ndoctrine of dual or rival control. If I am right in my understanding of Lis\nargument, it might be paraphrased somewhat as follows :\u2014Consciousness is\n\fsupplement.I Subliminal Self or Unconscious Cerebration ? 329\nan accompaniment, under certain conditions, of the functioning of the brain\nisa whole. It is a unity which reflects the synthesis, or nither synergy, of the\nseveral cerebral centres. To recognise a secondary consciousness would be to\nadmit the possibility of a second synthesis of brain centres. Such dual con\ntrol in an organism would be opposed to all physiological analogy. There\nfore there is no secondary consciousness.\nAs to whether that contention is sound physiologically, I am not competent\nto offer an opinion. But, arguing solely from the iwychological data at\npresent available, I am led, provisionally, to the same conclusion. I can find\nno evidence that would lead me to believe that there are two independent\norganised systems of consciousness operating simultaneously in any of the\nessessofar brought forward. The ordinary case of the hypnotic subject\u2014with\nwhich in this connection we may group such morbid cases as those of Felida\nX. and Janet's hystero-anfesthetic patients\u2014certainly seem to call for no\nsuch explanation. These are all instances of what Mr. Pierce calls\n\"Fluctuating Consciousness.\" In other words, the two consciousnesses\nmay be represented by concentric circles, of which the normal is always the\nsmaller. There is here no conflict or co-operation of independent centres of\nconsciousness: the \"secondary\" consciousness differs from the primary\nmerely in containing more elements. This difference, as formulated by\nMr. Pierce in physiological terms, is no doubt due to the removal of certain\ninhibitions existing in the normal state, or to the stimulation to \"conscious\nness-point of excitation\" of certain cerebral tracts normally dormant. In\npsychological language, a secondary consciousness includes a wider range of\nmotor or sensory images, of ideas and emotions. But it is essentially one\nconsciousness, its centre the same, its periphery enlarged. And there is, I\nimagirle, little evidence that the \" Secondary \" consciousness deserves even\nthe name of an enlarged consciousness in its earlier stages\u2014except in those\nrare cases where the field of waking consciousness has been abnormally\nrestricted by disease. In the ordinary hypnotic subject it appears to take\n\u00abime time for the consciousness to become developed. In the process of\nsuch development, no doubt, it assumes into itself new elements, both\nsubjective and objective\u2014facts of internal sensation and lapsed memories,\nas well as novel experiences from without. By such means, as in Madame\nB.'s case, the trance-consciousness may be educated and developed, so\nas not merely to present a widely different content, but to assume a different\ncharacter from the primary state of the same individual. But this is purely\nan artificial product. It is one consciousness which has worked up into\norganic relation with itself the fresh material presented to it. We only know\n\"Leontine\" in her mature state. But it is not likely that she came into the\nworld full-grown.\nThe instances in which the secondary consciousness intrudes into the\ndomain of ordinary life may seem irreconcilable with this view of the\nmatter. When the hidden \"Adrienne\" answers intelligent questions\nwhilst \" Louise \" is talking to the company at large ; when the hypnotic\nsubject, in the midst of a conversation in the normal state, gets up to poke\nthe fire in obedience to a mandate given 10 minutes before in the hypnotic\ntrance ; or writes out the solution of an arithmetical problem whilst\nreading the newspaper aloud\u2014do not these various acts indicate two\n\f330 ISupplement\nFrank Podmore.\nsimultaneously functioning centres of consciousness 1 Mr. Pierce has\nrecognised the difficulty, and attempts to meet it by suggesting that the\nacts performed by the secondary consciousness, as the planchette-writing, and\npoking of the fire, and whispered conversation, are automatic and per\nformed without consciousness. But the facts are against this explanation,\nat least, in some cases. Mr. Gurney, for instance, has shewn (see his article\non \"Peculiarities of Certain Post-hypnotic States,\" Proceedings, S.P.R.,\nVol. IV., pp. 268-323), that the actions attributed to the Secondary Self are\nfrequently so difficult and complicated as necessarily to imply the exercise\nof the fullest intelligence of which the subject is capable. Moreover, the\nre-hypnotised subject remembers the performance of the enjoined act, and\ncan explain any peculiarities in its performance, and correct mistakes made.\nIt would surely be extravagant to refuse to admit that such acts are\ndeliberately and consciously performed. But the facts appear sometimes to\nbe not inconsistent with the converse supposition,\u2014that it is the actions\nattributable to the primary self which are performed without conscious\nguidance, as the response of some lower cerebral centre, through well-worn\nnerve channels, to familiar stimuli. The attention of observers and\nexperimenters has been directed almost exclusively to the acts attributed to\nthe secondary consciousness, and the attempt to prove that such acts\nindicate intelligence and volition, and the workings of the primary conscious\nness have been comparatively neglected. We are given no detail in many\ncases of the waking occupations of Mr. Gurney's subjects. Perhaps the\nactions of their waking selves were the purely reflex response to the spoken\nor printed words. Indeed, in some curious experiments, directed to\nobtaining \"evidence of an absolutely complete and mutually exclusive\nsegregration of two simultaneous states or streams of consciousness in the\nsame individual,\" (Loc. cit. pp. 318 et seq.) Mr. Gurney succeeded only\nin demonstrating that when the performance assigned to the primary self\nwas of a nature to demand the full exercise of intelligence, the secondary\nconsciousness was unable to discharge its allotted task. The subject, for\ninstance, read, \" Through the Looking Glass \" aloud \"with spirit and enjoy\nment,\" but failed simultaneously to multiply 697 by 8 through planchette ; in\nother words, Mr. Gurney failed to obtain the evidence which he desired. And,\nindeed, it is obvious, as Mr. Gurney points out, that it would in any circum\nstance be extremely difficult to obtain clear proof of such a proposition as the\nsimultaneous functioning of two independent centres of consciousness. We\nknow from the fact of the subsequent memory, and from other tests, such\nas the susceptibility at the time to hallucination, that the subject in obeying\na post-hypnotic command frequently relapses into the hypnotic or secondary\nstate. Apparent instances, therefore, of the simultaneous performance of\nintelligent acts by two separate centres of consciousness, may be explained\u2014\nsince it is practically impossible to prove that the acta were really\nsimultaneous\u2014as examples of the rapid alternation or fluctuation of the\nfield of consciousness.\nBut, in fact, all these difficulties disappear, or at least assume less\nformidable proportions, if we accept the conclusion to which analogy and the\nfacts of observation alike point us, to wit, that we have been too hasty in\ndefining the limits of consciousness. We are dealing, as has been said, with\n\fSupplementI Subliminal Self or Unconscious Cerebration? 331\ntwo parallel series of phenomena, brain changes anil states of consciousness.\nIt has for some time been recognised that the physical chain is complete\nand continuous. Yet we seem willing to believe in the mental chain as\nfragmentary. We talk of the stream of consciousness : we suffer ourselves\nto resolve it into a series of detached pools. Unless we are prepared to\nadmit that consciousness is simply a bye-product of cerebral activity, it is\ndifficult to account for its existence at all, except on the supposition that it is\ncontinuous. If consciousness really disappears periodically\u2014in sleep, for\ninstance, or coma\u2014how can it ever arise again de noro, if we repudiate the\nexplanation of it as a secretion of the brain-cells ? But if we admit what\nfacts of observation also seem to indicate, the absolute continuity of con\nsciousness : if we abolish the old distinction between conscious and uncon\nscious, and substitute, to borrow a phrase of Mr. Lang's, cniitcioiu> and not-$o\nwnsciom, we shall find the phenomena intelligible. We have been, perhaps,\nat fault in our interrogation of consciousness. A more patient and searching\nscrutiny would have brought to light much that has hitherto escaped our\nnotice. The strong light is focussed, it is true, only on the objects of\nimmediate interest : but outside the brilliant circle which illumines our every\nday life may be discerned dim images, growing ever fainter and fainter, but\nstill recognisable. Amongst such dim shapes, seen momentarily and then\nforgotten, are the dreams which we faintly recall on our first waking,\nfragments of half-heard conversations, the actions which we class as habitual\nor automatic. We may recognise, as fully as Mr. Pierce does, that these\nactions are prepared, and these images recorded, automatically\u2014that is, by\nlower members of the cerebral hierarchy, acting without direct reference to\nor express mandate from the central government ; but nevertheless in strict\nsubordination to their sovereign as responsible ministers of a constitutional\nmonarchy. To admit thus much, and yet to recognise that these actions are\naccompanied by some degree of consciousness, is not to countenance anarchy\nor even to connive at dual control.\nIn brief, to vary the metaphor, since it is only by metaphors that we\ncan reason at all in such matters, it would seem that the hypnotic trance\nand other forms of the secondary consciousness simply open the door and\nadmit the light to our psychological lumber-room. The pressure upon the\narea of our working consciousness is great, and its capacity limited. As a\nresult whole classes of ideas and sensations get crowded out. In the long\nascent from the amoeba we may suppose that group after group of simple sensa\ntions fell back into the unconscious or the \"not so conscious,\" as their place\nwas required by the more complex images called into existence by the chang\ning environment. Even in the lifetime of the individual the thoughts and\nmemories of childhood and youth are gradually thrust into that twilight by\nthe urgent affairs of our maturer life. Year by year sensations once vivid\ngrow fainter and finally pass unregarded. New forms of activity are practised\nwith anxious care, and repeated until use has made them familiar, and ulti\nmately cease to require an express mandate from the sovereign power for their\nperformance. It is then of this psychological lumber-room that the crystal and\nthe hypnotist's command throw open the door. It by no means follows from\nthe fact that the furniture thus revealed has been gradually rejected by the\ngrowing consciousness, that it is of little value. The lumber-rooms of our\n\f332 ISupplement.\nFrank Podmore.\ngrandfathers and grandmothers would often have been found, one imagines, to\ncontain Queen Anne sideboards, Sheraton tables, Chippendale chairs, and many\nother things of higher use and greater beauty than the veneered monstrosi\nties with which their possessors had filled the places left vacant. So in the\nlumber-room of memory we may find much that we would gladly see furbished\nup and brought into the daylight again\u2014forgotten scenes, neglected ideals,\nfaith grown dusty from disuse. Sometimes we may find there a \" Wild\nDuck Attic \"\u2014the hidden romance of a life-time. It is likely enough that\nthe hap-hazard process of selection which the contents of our consciousness\nhave undergone causes the loss of much that we would not willingly let pass\naway. When the nature of the process and the results which attend it are\nmore clearly recognised, we may find it possible to recover something of this\nso-called lumber from oblivion, and thus enlarge and enrich our work-a-day\nselves. But as yet we seem to have found in the subliminal consciousness no\ncertain indication of any knowledge or faculties which have not at some time\nplayed a part in the primary field. We come across memories of childhood\nand many old forgotten things ; we come across traces of long lost but once\nserviceable faculties\u2014telepathy, sense of time, of direction, of weight ; we\nacquire partial control over bodily functions\u2014digestion, circulation, and the\nlike\u2014which civilised man has learned to acquiesce in as beyond his guidance.\nBut in all this we only resume possession of our own. And I submit that\nwe have as yet no sufficient evidence of anything beyond that. The\nsubliminal consciousness presents to us\u2014if we can read it right\u2014an epitome\nof our own past. It gives us hope and help for the future, not, on a sober\ninterpretation of the facts, by holding out the promise of transcendental\nfaculties, but by showing us what we have once had, and have not yet\nwholly lost.\nFrank Podmore.\n\fGeneral Meeting. 333\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETING.\nThe 75th General Meeting of the Society was held at the .West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, October 11th, at 8.30 p.m.; Professor\nSidgwick in the chair.\nStatements were made by the Chairman, Dr. Hodgson, and Mr.\nMyers as to the results of a series of experiments made at Cambridge\nwith an Italian \" medium,\" Eusapia Paladino.

Myers.\nChapter VIII.\nThe Relation op Supernormal Phenomena to Time ;\u2014\nRetrocognition.\nIn a series of chapters dealing with the existence and faculties of a\nSubliminal Self,\u2014a part of our mind or faculty which lies below the\nthreshold of our ordinary consciousness,\u2014I have called attention to\nmany facts which indicate that we are in reality beings of wider scope\nand deeper powers than we habitually suppose. Reviewing almost\nevery known group of supernormal phenomena in turn, I have tried to\nshow that this submerged faculty has much to do with the perception\nor production of them all.\nThere remain, however, two considerable groups of phenomena\nwhich in this connexion I have hardly yet touched. One of these\ngroups consists of physical phenomena, such as have been described in\nthese Proceedings especially in connection with the late Mr. Stainton\nMoses. Their relation to man's subliminal faculty must be reserved for\nfuture discussion. There remains that varied group of incidents which\nraise the question of the relation to Time borne by these hidden\npowers which in other ways have shown themselves so far-reaching and\nflexible. I have indeed already touched the margin of this subject in\na chapter on \" Hypermnesic Dreams \" (Proceedings, Vol. VIII). And\na more direct attack on the problem has been made by Mrs. Sidgwick,\nwho published about six years ago (Proceedings, Vol. V.) a paper \"On\nthe Evidence for Premonitions.\"\nThat paper contained a collection of the best cases of apparent\npremonition which we had received up to that time, during six years\nof enquiry ; with a discussion of those sources of error, such as illusion\nof memory and accidental coincidence, which need to be fully con\nsidered before we can even provisionally believe that anything so\napparently inexplicable as a real prefigurement of the future has in\nreality occurred. Mrs. Sidgwick's cases (some thirty in number) were\nin her judgment (with which I agreed) inadequate to establish so\nstrange a conclusion. \"We cannot, I think,\" she says, p. 353, \"demand\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 335\nthat the possibility of supernormal prevision should be accepted even\nas a working hypothesis by the scientific world, as I myself consider\nthat telepathy ought to be accepted. Still, there is enough evidence to\nmake us think about it ; and one advantage of having a society like\nours is to bring home to people the importance of observing and record\ning at once facts bearing on such subjects, and to supply a centre where\nsuch records can be kept.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick's discussion has been effective in the direction\ndesired ; and at least double the amount of evidence of this type\nwhich our society had amassed during the six years which preceded\nthat paper has been sent to us, or printed elsewhere, during the\nseven years which have followed it. On this ground alone the time\nhas plainly come for another stock-taking ;\u2014which in consequence\nof other engagements of Mrs. Sidgwick's it devolves upon me to\nattempt.1\nThe evidence, I say, has grown in the way which was to be expected\nif precognition were-\u2014and hardly unless it were\u2014a true fact in\nnature. And at the same time the whole question has gradually\nassumed a new aspect. In the earlier years of our research the\nevidence for precognition was entirely divorced from experiments ;\nwas derived from sources almost wholly separate from our sources of\nevidence to other supernormal phenomena ; and even had it bulked\nlarge enough for acceptance on its own merits, would in its nature\nand scope have found no manifest link with other results of our\nenquiry.\nIn each of these three respects there has been an improvement in\nthe situation. In the first place, there is now a beginning\u2014it is not\nyet more\u2014of actual experiment in this direction, from which experi\nment seemed wholly excluded. In place of the spontaneous, confused,\nimperfectly remembered dreams which still form the main bulk of\nour evidence for precognition, we are now sometimes able to substitute\nthose voluntary, externalised, and easily recordable visions which\nconstitute the \" crystal pictures \" to which attention has begun to\nbe directed, and which include a small percentage of precognitive\nscenes.\nAs I have often urged, the first discovery of an actual method of\nexperiment\u2014however difficult and uncertain\u2014in such an enquiry as\nthis brings it at once out of a region where we can never count on\nadvance into a region where, if sufficient diligence be used, progress\nmust in time follow.\n1 1 shall assume that the reader is familiar not only with the cases, but with the\nevidential criticisms in the article referred to. I am treating the subject in a\nsomewhat different manner ; but those criticisms of course continue to apply equally\nto the cases which I shall quote.\n2 c 2\n\f336 F. W. H. Myers.\nIn the second place, the lapse of years has now allowed us to\nobserve with some continuity the experiences of a good many\ninformants ; and in most cases we have found that where there is\nfrequent telepathy or clairvoyance, there is pretty sure also to be some\nanomaly in the time-relations of the phenomena which no simple\nformula (such as a supposed latency of telepathic impressions) will\nserve to explain. Our living sources, that is to say, of telepathic and\nof precognitive evidence are now in many cases the same.\nAnd thirdly, as we get some further glimpse into the laws which\nunderlie our varied phenomena, we see more clearly that retrocognition\nand precognition\u2014 supernormal knowledge of Past and Future\u2014cannot\nsafely be set aside as isolated problems ;\u2014as fortresses which we may\nleave behind us unattacked as we advance over our newly conquered\nrealm. On the contrary, our work tends to become more and more\nemphatically an exploration of faculty ;\u2014not merely a collection of\nevidence to particular occurrences, but a following out of every clue\nwhich may lead to knowledge of what is actually going on beneath the\nthreshold while certain resulting phenomena are showing themselves\nabove it. We must search for the natural groups into which our cases\nfall ; contenting ourselves no longer with the first obvious lines of\nclassification.\nOn no side, then, may we leave supernormal phenomena unattacked.\nWe must not take for granted their relation to any great category of\nhuman thought. Their relation to time is as unknown to us a priori\nas is their relation to space or to physical causation. Their relation to\nspace, indeed, was necessarily our first subject of enquiry. Our first\ntask was to prove that space is bridged by some form of mental trans\nmission which no known laws will explain. Into this enquiry time\nonly entered in so far as it was needful to prove temporal coincidence,\nin order to prove causal connexion, between the event in one place and\nits spiritual repercussion in another.\nAnd could our enquiry have been arrested here there would be a\ncomparative simplicity even in our novel conclusions. In a universe\nwhere instantaneous gravitation operates unexplained,\u2014where a world\nof ether coexists with a world of matter,\u2014men's minds must needs have\na certain openness to other mysterious transmissions ; must be ready to\nconceive other invisible environments or co-existences, and in a sense\nto sit loose to the conception of Space, regarded as an obstacle to\ncommunication or cognition. A similar emancipation from the\nlimitations of Time is more difficult. We can, of course, imagine\nincreased powers of remembering the Past, of inferring the Future.\nBut we can hardly conceive the Past revived, save in some mind which\nhas directly observed it. And to imagine the Future as known, except\nby inference and contingently, to any mind whatever is to induce at\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 337\nonce that iron collision between Free Will, and \"Fixed Fate, Fore\nknowledge absolute,\" from which no sparks of light have ever yet been\nstruck. Still more unwelcome is the further view that the so-called\nFuture actually already exists ; and that apparent time-progression is\na subjective human sensation, and not inherent in the universe as that\nexists in an Infinite Mind.\nNor shall we in fact find it necessary to insist upon any very\nrevolutionary line of explanation. There is one analogy which will\nmeet most of our evidence (although not all), and to which we shall\nrepeatedly recur as our simplest guide. As is the memory and the\nforesight of a child to that of a man, even such, I shall suggest, is the\nmemory and the foresight of the man's supraliminal self as compared\nto the retrocognition and the precognition exercised by an intelligence\nunrestrained by sensory limits ;\u2014whether that intelligence belong to\nthe man's own subliminal self, or to some unembodied spirit. I main\ntain that in this thesis there is nothing incredible ;\u2014nay, that it is the\nnecessary corollary of belief in the existence anywhere of any extension\nof the powers which we habitually exercise.\nIf there is a transcendental world at all there is a transcendental\nview of Past and Future fuller and farther-reaching than the empirical ;\nand in that view we may ourselves to some extent participate, either\ndirectly, as being ourselves denizens all along of the transcendental\nworld, or indirectly, as receiving intimations from spirits from whom\nthe shadow in which our own spirits are \" half lost \" has melted\naway.\nThis I believe to be the central reflection to which the study of\nsupernormal knowledge of Past and Future at present points us ; and\nI shall be well satisfied if the evidence which I shall adduce should\npersuade the reader that in some undefined fashion we share at\nmomenta in this transcendental purview. As to the precise manner in\nwhich we share it, the difficulties are just those which meet us when, in\nany other group of our phenomena, we try to distinguish between the\nactivity of the automatist's own spirit, and of other spirits, embodied\nor unembodied, and perhaps also of a World-Soul or of Intelligences\nabove anthropomorphic personification. But this uncertainty will be a\nsecondary matter ; since our first business in this little-explored region\nwill be simply to collect trustworthy experiments, well-evidenced\nnarratives, and to cement them together with only just so much of\ntheoretic mortar as may enable them to be surveyed without needless\nwnfusion.\nSuch will be my course in the two chapters which follow, in which\nI shall in the first place briefly describe the general character of our\nevidence for retrocognition and precognition ; shall then cite the\nnarratives; and shall finally give a diagrammatic and provisional\n\f338 F. W. H. Myers.\nview of what I conceive to be their relations to each other, and to\nother supernormal facts.\nThe general characteristic, then, of these occurrences is to show us\nfragments of knowledge coming to us in obscure and often symbolical\nways, and extending over a wider tract of time than any faculty\nknown to us can be stretched to cover. On the one side there is\nretrocognition, or knowledge of the past, extending back beyond the\nreach of our ordinary memory ; on the other side there is precognition,\nor knowledge of the future, extending onwards beyond the scope of\nour ordinary inference.\nIn each direction, indeed, there are certain landmarks ; the regres\nsion and the progression alike seem to develop gradually, and to follow\nlines which we can learn to recognise. In the direction of the Past we\nbegin with hypermnesia ; our first step lies in the conception that what\nhas once been presented to our sensory field, although never gathered\ninto what we deem our conscious perception, may nevertheless have\nbeen perceived and retained by the subliminal self. It is partly\nthrough dream and partly by automatic artifices that this fact is\nrealised ; and those same dreams, those same artifices of script or vision,\npresently carry us a step further, and reveal a knowledge which must\nhave come from the memories of other living persons, or (as I hold)\nof departed spirits. Then in another direction a less direct source of\nknowledge opens out ; living organisms, our own or others', disclose\n(in ways unknown to biology) the history implicate in their structure ;\nobjects which have been in contact with organisms preserve their\ntrace ; and it sometimes seems as though even inorganic nature could\nstill be made, so to say, luminescent with the age long story of its\npast. Or it may even be that some retrocognitive picture is presented\nwhich we may discover to be veracious, but with which we can discern\nno spiritual or material link ; as though a page of the cosmic record\nhad been opened to us at random, and had closed again without sign\nor clue.\nAnd next let us look forward into the Future ;\u2014across that im\npalpable, almost imaginary line of the Present Moment, which for us is\nthe greatest reality of all. Naturally enough, the first time-confusion\nwhich we find is a confusion affecting that present moment itself ;\nnamely, that sensation of already remembering what is happening or is\njust about to happen to which some authors have applied the too wide\nterm paramnesia, but for which promnesia seems a more exact and\ndistinctive name. Next we have the wide range of suggestive phe\nnomena, where the subliminal self possesses knowledge of the future\nunshared by the supraliminal ; since the subliminal self has in fact\nwound up the organism to strike a given note at a given hour.\nSelf-suggestion in turn merges into organic prevision ; where the\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 339\nsubliminal self foresees what will happen\u2014not in consequence of any\ndetermining effort of its own, but by virtue of its deeper knowledge\nof the organism and of the changes which that organism must by\nphysiological laws undergo. This organic prevision may lead us far;\nbut as it grows more distant and complex, involving more and more\nof a man's future environment, as well as of his future organic history,\nit merges into a form of precognition which cannot depend on insight\ninto material bodies alone.\nWe now proceed, that is to say, along a line which is an\nextension of ordinary intellectual inference. First comes hyperes-\nthetic inference ;\u2014that enlarged span of anticipation which acuter\nsensory impressions permit ; as a sensitive patient will be able to\npredict her doctor's visit when his step is merely heard in the\nstreet, although others cannot recognise that step until it is close\nto the bedroom door. Then comes an obscure point where this\nhyperesthesia seems to pass into teltesthesia ;\u2014-where sensory per\nception seems to cease, and supersensory, telepathic, or clairvoyant\nperception to begin.\nThus to take the common instance of auditory hyperesthesia\nalluded to above, Lady Eardley, (a witness already cited), tells me,\u2014\nand her husband, Commander de Lousada, confirms to me her\nrecollection,\u2014that for some weeks, when she was in very weak health,\nand also much distressed by a business matter, she distinguished from\nher London bedroom the special sound which a heavy letter made in\nfalling into the letter box.1 I have listened from the same room, and\ncannot myself hear any sound of letters falling in. But Lady\nEardley also knew, she says, that these heavy letters, or certain among\nthem, were latoyers' letters; and thinks that she did not discern this\nby hearing alone. No notes were taken at the time, (some years\nago), and the account, therefore, is not evidential ; but it illustrates\nthe confused percipience which marks the line between hyperesthesia\nand telsesthesia, when impressions are referred to a sensory channel\nthrough which they may possibly have not really arrived. Some\nof Mrs. Verrall's experiments (Proceedings Vol. XI., p. 184 ifec.),\nillustrate the same form of confusion.\nWell then, when we have definitely passed from the sensory to the\ntranscendental mode of perception, it is probable that our power of\ninference as to the future will be greatly enlarged. We cannot,\nindeed, guess how far this enlargement will extend. There is nothing\nabsolutely to forbid us to regard all precognitions as the result of\nthis wider outlook of the subliminal self.\n1 Indications of a similar hyperesthesia were observed by Dr. Hodgson with\nMiss Mollie Fancher ;\u2014a sensitive well-known in America.\n\f840 F. W. H. Myers.\nNor shall I attempt to draw the line at which this telesthetic in\nference ceases. If I do still look further for other sources of precogni\ntion, this is partly because in some cases I think that there is actual\nevidence that the precognition comes from a disembodied intelligence ;\nand partly also on the wider ground that I distrust all explanations\nwhich give to man, embodied or disembodied, any monopoly of the\ntranscendental world. The simplicity of our instinctive anthropo\nmorphism is not the simplicity of truth ;\u2014it is no more so, when we\nare thus dealing with intelligences which may be far above our ken,\nthan when the savage ascribes to a man-like demon the movements\nand influences of gross inanimate things.\nBut first, as I have said, I ascribe some precognitions to the\nreasoned foresight of disembodied spirits, just as I ascribe some retro-\ncognitions to their surviving memory. I have tried in an earlier paper\nto show ground for believing that some spirits have a continued\nknowledge of some earthly affairs ; and if they have such knowledge,\nand can show us that they have it, they may presumably reveal to us\nalso their not infallible inferences from what they know.\nThus far I have been indicating roads along which I fancy that\nbelievers in any kind of transcendental faculty will some day be forced\nto travel. What follows is a speculation, or suspicion, which no\nrecords or experiments of ours can prove, but which seems to me to\nloom behind them all. I suspect, then, that it is not by wider purview,\nwiser inference alone, that finite minds, in the body or out of it, have\nattained to knowledge of what yet must be. I imagine that the\nContinuity of the Universe is complete ; and that therefore the\nhierarchy of intelligences between our minds and the World-Soul is\ninfinite ; and that somewhere in that ascent a point is reached\nwhere our conception of time loses its accustomed meaning. To\nPlato's \"Spectator of all Time and of all Existence\" there may be\nno barrier between Then and Now. The idea, of course, is familiar\nenough to philosophical speculation. The novelty is that this, with\nmany other ideas which have hitherto floated gaseously inter apices\nphilosophies, like helium in the atmosphere of the sun, may now\nconceivably be tested in earthly laboratories and used as a working\nexplanation for undeniable facts. For the moment I say no more ; the\nreader will judge with the cases before him whether amid contingent\nprefigurements we find something of inevitable ; or among individual\nised inferences some trace of a Cosmic Mind.\nWe shall have to set forth evidence illustrative of each of these\nmain lines of speculation in turn. But before we embark definitely\non either our backward or our forward survey, we are met by a familiar\npsychological puzzle, of no great evidential significance, but yet afford\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 341\ning a useful introduction to further problems. I allude to the sensation,\nmuch discussed in France of late, of the deja vu ; the feeling which\nmany men have experienced, \"I have lived through all this before, and\nI know what will happen this next minute.\"1\nOrdinary explanations of promnesia (as I shall call this sensation)\nfollow two main types.\n1. The reminiscence is a true one, depending (a) on a past waking\nexperience, or (6) on a past dream which some similarity in circum\nstances recalls to memory.\n2. The reminiscence is illusory, depending (a) on a kind of malady\nof perception or attention affecting the whole personality, or (6) on\nsome sort of splitting of the personality, as, for instance, on asynchron-\nism of cerebral hemispheres, etc.\n1 (a). It is probable that most of my readers share the belief\nwhich was my own so long as I argued from my personal promnesic\nsensations in boyhood ; namely, that a confused recollection of\nactual past events gave rise to the feeling that I knew what was\ngoing to happen. This view was supported by the triviality of the\noccasions when I had the feeling, as in the course of some familiar\ngame or talk. Until one learns how small a fraction of human\nsensation or emotion one's own capacity comprehends, one is apt to\nthink that the strongest records of what others feel are mere\nexaggerated descriptions of something one has felt oneself. And\noften, after all, this is true ; and probably a large proportion of\npromnesic experiences have this simple source.\n1 (b). It is obviously possible also that a suddenly evoked\nreminiscence of a past dream may give rise to the feeling of \" deja vu,\"\n\u2014of having witnessed the actual scene at some indefinite time before.\nIf such coincidence with a previous dream were a merely casual one,\nthis heading would be a mere variety of 1 (a). The really important\nquestion\u2014to which we must presently return\u2014is whether the con\nnexion may be other than casual, whether the dreamer may in some\nsupernormal way have visited the scene, or anticipated the experience,\nwhich he was destined afterwards to behold or to undergo.\n2 (a). The hypothesis of some kind of interruption or indecision in\nthe acts of perception and attention, giving rise to a confused location\n1 It seems to me undesirable to give to this phenomenon the name paramnesia,\nas has been commonly done of late. The word paramnesia should mean simply\n' erroneous or morbid memory,\"\u2014as paresthesia and parageusia (for instance) mean\nerroneous or morbid sensation or taste. It is inconvenient to try to narrow a word of\nthis general type to connote one small group of phenomena ; not to say that it is\n**f!?ing the question to assume that those phenomena are in any way morbid. The\nParadoxical term *' promnesia,\"\u2014memory beforehand- seems to me to express unmis\ntakably the paradoxical sensation under review,\u2014and to express nothing more.\n\f342 F. W. H. Myers.\nin time of the object perceived, has been worked out in various\nways, all of which seem purely hypothetical.1 Such confusions may\nexist, but they can in any case explain only the slighter and moment\nary forms of promnesia, not those cases where the sensation of memory\nbecomes definite enough to attract to it the percipient's full and\ndeliberate attention.\n2 (b). The old idea of a lack of precise concordance between the\nperceptions of the two cerebral hemispheres seems to be scouted on\nthe Continent, but is still occasionally revived in England. (See Brain,\nWinter number, 1895.) I cannot myself see how a functional\nasynchronism of this sort can be proved except by indications of a\ndefinitely right-handed or left-handed character\u2014such as mirror-\nwriting\u2014none of which have, so far as I know, been as yet noted in\ndirect connection with promnesia. It would not, indeed, surprise me\nif they were so observed, since I have in an earlier paper, (Proceedings,\nVol. III., p. 1), collected some indications that the subliminal self\nsometimes manifests itself preferentially through the right or less-used\nhemisphere ; and since I am also disposed to think, (as I must now\nexplain), that one among many causes of promnesia may lie in a\ndouble perception of the present moment by the subliminal and the\nsupraliminal self.\nThis view, although it must inevitably remain a conjecture like the\nrest, rests at any rate upon a plausible deduction from what I regard as\nthe facts of subliminal hyperesthesia, hypermnesia, telsesthesia. If the\nsubliminal self notes and remembers more than the supraliminal,\nits process of perception must be in some way different and superior,\neven when concerned with objects within the ordinary sensory field.\nAnd this difference in mode of perception may sometimes involve a\nduplication or confusion of the sense of time.\nTo understand this let us endeavour to realise the apparently\nsimple, but really complex notion of the actual present moment.\nThe true Present is an evanescent, an infinitesimal thing. It is\nthe imaginary meeting-point between two eternities ; and the more\nfinely we divide Time the less is left which is not Past or Future. But\nfor us men the \"specious present,\" as it has been well called, is a solid\n\" duration-block,\" consisting of a small fragment of Time Past p\/u* a\nstill smaller fragment of indistinguishably vivid anticipation of Time\nFuture ;\u2014the length and context of the duration-block being con\nditioned for each of us by our several organisms.\nLet me consider in what ways this \" specious present \" of mine is\nobviously defective.\n1 See various papers in the Revue Philosophique for 1894, or summarised in the\nAnnie Psychologiquc for 1895.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 843\nTn the first place I observe that my perception of the actual\nmoment is always retarded, and is irregularly retarded ; so that it\nis both in arrear as a whole and also blurred by the trails or\nprolongations of special perceptions which are still more in arrear\nthan the rest.\nIn the second place I observe that the span of my present,\u2014my\nprotensive span, to adopt a word of Hamilton's,\u2014is after all so short, in\nspite of its tardiness and its blurring trails, that the actual external\nor organic event of the instant is only dimly intelligible to me, and\nneeds to be perpetually explained by memory and anticipation. Let\nus consider these complaints in order.\n1. The retardation of our perception of the content of the actual\nmoment by the necessary journey of our impressions from end-organ\nto sensorium is matter of common knowledge, and even of practical\ninconvenience, where, as in astronomy, exact measurements of time\nare needed and \" personal equations \" have to be allowed for.\n2. Our perception is irregularly retarded, not only by the variable\nmedia of our environment, which split up one instantaneous event into\npast, present, and future (as when I recollect the lightning and antici\npate the thunder), but also by the nature of our nervous system, which\n, continues the heterogeneous changeable character of the environment,\nand makes perception slower at some moments than at others, and at\nsome peripheral points than at others,\u2014so that a tap on the leg appears\nlater in time than a simultaneous flash in the eyes.\n3. Our perception is blurred by the reverberation of our sense-\norgans, which, having been stirred into one special thrill, cannot\ninstantly arrest it and start on another.\n4. Our protensive span suffices us under familiar conditions, but is\ninadequate in sudden crises. The presence of mind which then becomes\nso important means, in fact, a resolute maintenance of the protensive\nspan of the specious present, so that the immediate past may be firmly\nrealised and the immediate future foreseen ; in place of the mere\nbewildered instantaneous consciousness of shock to which the present\nis then apt to shrink.1\nLet us consider in a simple example the effect of all these weak\nnesses together upon our perception of a given scene, as compared\nwith what that perception might be, were it direct and unhindered by\norganic disabilities. A horse leaps a fence, and goes through attitudes\nABODE, with sounds corresponding to each moment of movement\nthrough the air. Now most of the details of this moving scene,\u2014the\nseparate hairs of the horse, the minor noises,\u2014lie beyond my sensation\naltogether. What I do perceive is a general effect, irregularly retarded.\n1 On all this see Prof. James' Principles of Psychology, Vol. I., chaps. XV., XVI.\n\f344 F. W. H. Myers.\nWhen the horse is at E I hear him at A and see him mainly at C ; but\na trail of vision persisting from A and B gives me, in fact, a confused\ndissolving view of ABC, modified by a dim but irresistible foresight\nof D. Meantime (let us say) an instantaneous camera photographs\nthe horse in each attitude, and thus decomposes my dissolving view\ninto a series of definite successive pictures.\nNow suppose, for argument's sake, that while my supraliminal self\nis looking through my eyes, my subliminal self is looking through\nthe camera ; and that when the horse is at E the self which views\nthe first prospect becomes partially aware of the self which views the\nsecond; somewhat as happens in \"competition of visual fields,\" when\none looks through a stereoscope which offers a different scene to right\nand left eyes. What will the result be ? When the horse is actually\nat E I shall, as before, see him at C ; but I shall have also an impres\nsion that I have seen him at C already,\u2014and that I know, moreover,\nthat he will pass through D and E,\u2014up to the point at which the sub\nliminal self has already registered the pictures.\nNow this exactly corresponds to the promnesic sensation, which,\nalong with the impression that the present moment has been traversed\nalready, contains the impression that the immediate future has been\nlived through also, and is already known. At any given moment, of\ncourse, the subliminal perception would be only a fraction of a second\nin advance of the supraliminal ; but the coalescence of consciousnesses\nmight last for some time, much as it does in the case of automatic\nwriting or other automatisms. This explanation would not apply to\ncases where the subject believes himself to have a knowledge of facts\nnot instantly impending ; such a knowledge of a place, for instance, as\nenables him to guide others about it, or such a knowledge of words yet\nunuttered as enables him to forestall them by speech or act. Cases of\nthat kind, though sometimes classed with promnesia, really present a\ndifferent problem, and will be considered further on.\nIn the meantime I can perhaps best explain what has been said\naboveby a few extracts from a paper by M. Lalande (RevuePhilosophique,\nNovember, 1893), in which that psychologist, who seems to have been\nat more pains than any one else as yet to collect first-hand statements\nas to promnesia, comes to a conclusion essentially the same as that to\nwhich the facts which we in England have collected seem to me to\npoint.\nDealing then with this phenomenon, M. Lalande, while of course\nrecognising that the ordinary explanations will cover many cases, con\nsiders nevertheless that we often have here a supernormal fact, accom\npanied by subjective symptoms such as trifling errors of memory do not\nproduce. The feeling is said to be sometimes accompanied by a dis\ntressing emotion which may become actual terror. Among the phrases\n\fThe SMiminal Self. 345\nused are \"a disquietude,\" \"an oppression on the chest,\" \"a kind of\nvertigo.\" Other subjects remark that the feeling is like that of\nnightmare, and gives the impression of a world other than that in\nwhich we live. The subjects of promnesia, however, do not seem to be\nspecially morbid or nervous persons ; the main fact noticeable about\nthem being that they have often also experiences of veritable telepathy\nor precognition. I translate, with slight abridgement, M. Lalande's\nprincipal reflections, (loc. ext. p. 495.)\n\" It is possible in the first place that paramnesia may be produced by\nthat singular and almost indefinite acceleration which thought occasionally\nassumes. The striking examples quoted by M. Taine place beyond doubt\nthe capacity of the human spirit to represent to itself in a few seconds series\nof conscious states whose ordinary subjective duration would occupy several\nhours. On the other hand we must remember that we are never conscious of\naU the perceptions which we experience at a given moment. Compare these\ntwo facts. You are presented with a new landscape, and you receive thence\na mass of images which your intelligence does not at once comprehend, but\nwhich enter therein none the less, like an instantaneous photograph. Sup\npose then a distraction of the tenth of a second, during which your thoughts\niy elsewhere, and rapidly summarise a subjective period say of ten or fifteen\nminutes ;\u2014what will happen when you return from the distraction ? You\nwill behold and recognise the scene which your thought quitted for a\nmoment, but you will not refer the first act of perception to its right place\nin time ;\u2014in the first place on account of the partially unconscious character\nof the original perception ; but especially on account of the apparent length\nof the moment of distraction. The second perception might thus easily\nassume that form of spatial prevision which it wore with M. Sch. (who feels\nthat certain things ought to be in certain places in a room really seen for the\nfirst time, and on looking attentively finds that these things are there.)\n\" But something more is needed to explain prevision in time, which\nappears to be real according to the evidence quoted above. It seems that\nbetween simple cases of paramnesia and sensations called telepathic, there\nexists a series of intermediate cases, which connect the two by insensible\ntransitions. Numerous facts accumulated during several years by hypnotists,\ndoctors,and psychologists, give some appearance of probabilityto the existence\nof a very powerful hyperesthesia, which is almost always unconscious, and\nwhich permits objects to be seen at a distance, or under quite unusual\nconditions. This second sight may be simply an excitation of the senses\nalready known, or it may arise, as has often been suggested, from a different\nsensorium, rudimentary as yet, which might assist sight by extending it, as\nsight assists the sense of touch. It is unnecessary for the present question\nto decide between these two hypotheses ; either would do equally well.\nI shall then call this abnormal and unconscious perception \"telepathy\"\nwithout entering on the question of its cause.\n\" But if it is admitted that by accident a more or less intense excitement\nof the mind brings it into play, the result ought really to be, to make us see\nthe same object twice, in a time which will often be very limited. Thus on\nseeing a blow coming one believes one feels it beforehand. Let us take an\n\f346 F. W. H. Myers.\nexample to make the idea clear : I am walking with a friend ; he is thinking\na sentence which he is about to utter. A telepathic sensation is produced and\nI perceive clearly the inward speech in which he has thought his sentence.\nBut this perception to which I am unaccustomed remains unnoticed if the\nsentence is not really pronounced. If on the contrary he pronounces it\nimmediately, the auditive sensation will immediately awake in the hidden\ndepths of my mind the same perception that I had a minute ago ; I shall\nthink I recognise it, or rather I shall really recognise it. The only mistake\nwill be in projecting my remembrance into a more or less far-off past in order\nto explain to myself its confused character, which belongs only to its origin.\n'' But it is very evident that this special sensation would be likely to\nbecome equally apparent under the influence of other causes, such as dream,\npassion, hypnotism, and perhaps many other physiological agents, which\nhave not yet been remarked. The transitions between the two phenomena\nwould thus be quite natural. Quite natural also would be the comparison\nmade by observers between paramnesic prevision and a straying memory\njust \" on the tip of one's tongue.\" There would be the same passage from\nunconsciousness to perfect consciousness. This fact also would be explained,\nthat very often persons, who experience the most distinct cases of paramnesia,\nstate that they frequently have veridical presentiments also. This is the case\nwith M.M. L , Bo T, , amongst observers whom we have quoted.\nThe frequency of paramnesia with children again renders the existence of\nthis special sensation probable. With them as with savages the senses\nare more subtle and impressionable than with developed men. Life\nblunts our sensibility little by little, and above all, crystallises it in a set\nform. The organs of children on the contrary, more supple and more easily\nmodifiable, respond to slight actions (movements) to which our intellectual\nhardening has rendered us insensible.\"\nThe following case illustrates the kind of incident (familiar enough\nin these Proceedings) which M. Lalande finds not uncommon in the\nexperience of his promnesics.\n\" I was at one time (says his informant) the pupil of Father B., a Jesuit,\nwith whom I continued to correspond. After a silence of eighteen months,\nI felt one day some remorse, and I wrote him a letter to the Jesuit College at\nDole, where he was Professor. Shortly afterwards I was suddenly awakened\nin the middle of the night by a hand placed on my arm ; and I heard\nthe voice of Father B. saying to me, ' My dear friend, I am no longer at\nDole ; I am professor of mathematics at the College of Saint Michel, at\nSaint-Etienne.' I lit my candle and looked about me ; I saw no one, and\nnothing unusual ; I went to sleep again, supposing that it had been a dream.\nNoxt morning I received a letter from Father B., beginning with the very\nphrase which I had heard in the night. I was absolutely ignorant that he\nhad changed his residence, or that there was a Jesuit college at Saint-\nEtienne. The letter gave me quite a shock. \"\nThis is not strictly a premonition, as the letter was already written\nand passing through the post (Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 289); and its\noccurrence to a man habitually subject to promnesia seems to point to\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 347\ntelepathy as the explanation of both phenomena. Thus, when this\nsame M. J repeated to a friend (Lalande, p. 488) initial phrases\nyet unuttered of speeches in Ferdinand le Xoceur which he had never\nheard or read, he may have derived these phrases telepathically from\nthe minds of the actors awaiting their cues to strike in. Somewhat\nsimilarly, when a question is being passed down a class a boy pre\nviously ignorant of the answer sometimes catclies it (it is said) from the\neager (though silent) knowledge of the boy standing just below him.\nSach little incidents are hardly capable of proof, but yet are worth\nobservation.\nThere are not, however, many of the more advanced promnesic\ncases which telepathy would explain. Generally there is no other\nmind apparently involved, and it simply seems as though the\npromnesic either enjoyed at the moment a wider than ordinary\npercipience, or had already visited in some supernormal way the\nscene which he feels that he remembers. Now these are actually two\npossibilities of which we have well-attested examples. A telsesthetic\nextension of knowledge at the moment lies at the base of what we\nare accustomed to call monitions ; and dreams premonitory of future\nscenes or incidents form a great part of our evidence to precognition.\nAnd it can make no theoretical difference whether the objects of\nextended knowledge of either of these kinds are in themselves\nmomentous or trivial. It may be of great value to me to receive a\nwarning, through some supernormal faculty, that I am on the point of\nwalking into a dock in the dark ;\u2014very valueless to apprehend\nsimilarly that I shall come upon a church with a copper spire after\nthe next turn in the road ; but both impressions alike must fall for\nthe psychologist into the same category.\nThese small oscillations about the specious present, in short, when\never they mean more than mere mistake and confusion, are strictly\nanalogous to the ampler oscillations with which we are in these\nchapters mainly concerned.\nAnd passing on now to retrospects and prospects of wider scope,\nlet us begin with the backward swing of the pendulum, and consider\nto what extent our knowledge of the Past will sometimes open itself\nbeyond the familiar bounds. Brief discussion may serve, for many\npoints of detail have been already dealt with elsewhere.\nLet us, then, begin our study of supernormal retrocognition by first\ninquiring in what ways we ordinarily and normally acquire our\nknowledge of the Past. We acquire such knowledge partly from\ndirect personal memory, and partly from retrospective inference\nbased on what we see or hear. We might, indeed, define memory as\nan acquisition of fresh potential changes of consciousness concomitant\nwith changes in our organism, which imply certain past events as\n\f348 F. W. H. Myers.\ntheir cause. But this definition, which sounds natural enough when\napplied to diffused or organic memories, such as the cricketer's\nmemory of the feel of the bat, would seem pedantic if applied to\nthe minute cerebral changes which accompany the learning of a\nnew fact. In such a case we ignore in common speech the real\norganic change which the learning of any fact implies in us, and we\nmerely refer to the specialised sensory channel through which the\ninformation comes to us\u2014as hearing, reading, and so forth. In a\nvague but quite intelligible way, we thus mark off organic memory\nfrom definite sensory or intellectual memories.\nIn our inquiry into retrocognition it will be well to keep roughly\nto some division of this sort, and to begin by inquiring into the\nextensions which seem to be given to organic memory.\nWe know, of course, that there is a great difference between our\nevocable memory\u2014that which we can summon up and use at will\u2014and\nthat much ampler memory which we must suppose to exist, in some\npotential form at least, imprinted upon our organism. The faint and\ncrude recollections of sensations and movements, which are all that we\ncan call into ordinary consciousness, would be far from enabling us to\nrecognise sensations, or to repeat movements, as we actually do recognise\nand repeat them. The study of hypnotic suggestion, moreover, has\nshown us how these potential or latent memories may be grasped and\nused. The increased power over the organism which the subject\nunder suggestion shows necessarily implies an increased memory\nof the organism's past ; the hyperboulia, as I have termed it, is\nhypermnesia as well. That wider will-power, indeed, is probably no\nmore aware of the exact mechanism which it employs in its control of\nsecretions, ifec., than I am of the exact mechanism by which I raise my\nhand to my head. And, similarly, the hypnotic memory is probably\nitself very shallow as compared to what a complete summation of all\nthe lapsed memories of the organism might be. But already we find it\ndescending deeply to gland and blood-vessel, implicated as these are in\nstigmatisation and similar phenomena, and we can draw no clear line\nbelow which all organic consciousness must cease, and memory must\nbecome no more than a metaphor.\nWe cannot draw such a line, I say, either on the basis of smallness\nof magnitude or of remoteness in time. We cannot assert that organic\nmemory may not inhere in a single cell or neuron, or even in a single\nliving molecule. Neither can we assert that organic memory cannot be\nprolonged backwards before birth. Birth, indeed, is but an incident\nin each organism's history; that organism has an embryonic life\nbefore birth,\u2014and a pre-embryonic life in countless lines of ancestry.\nAlthough we no longer say with the \" traducianist \" schoolmen that\nAdam's body included not only his own soul but the souls of all his\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 340\ndescendants, we still trace to ancestors more remote than Adam\ncharacteristics which even now influence our psychical life.\nIt is a moot point how far the life-experiences of each organism\nmodify by what we regard as purely physiological transmission the\ncharacteristics of its descendants. The rude suggestion (so to term it)\nof the amputated limb, or other injury, is commonly not accepted by\nthe offspring ; the embryo develops unaffected by the shock which the\nparent has undergone previously to the act of union. But if that\nshock fall upon the mother during the embryo's life, and if it chance \u2014\n(in post-natal suggestions also there seems much of what we must\nneeds call chance in this)\u2014if it chance to reach the mother's subliminal\nself in effective fashion, it may then transfer itself to the embryo, and\nimprint upon the child the organic memory of the mother's emotion of\nadmiration, disgust, or fear. No one doubts this form of heredity\nwhen it is exhibited on a striking scale,\u2014as with children born during\nthe alarms of a siege, or of the Reign of Terror in France. And I\nbelieve that there is evidence enough (although I cannot quote it here)\nto show that isolated and momentary suggestions\u2014as the sight of a\ncrushed ankle or missing finger\u2014may produce a definite localised\neffect on the embryo in much the same way as a hypnotic suggestion\nmay produce a localised congestion or secretion.1\nIf, then, we thus find imprinted on the child's organism such a con\nspicuous, specialised memory of perhaps an almost instantaneous\nemotion of the mother's, we must surely suspect that his organism may\ncontain also some inborn memories less conspicuous and more purely\ncerebral than such a gross phenomenon as a mark on the face or a\ndeformed finger. And by this new route we shall come round again to\nsomething like the innate ideas of certain philosophical systems. Nor\ncan we absolutely limit such influence to the actual parent organism\nalone. For aught we know, the \" germ-plasm \"\u2014whatsoever may be\nthe continuous link of all generations\u2014may be capable of reacting to\npsychical suggestions as sensitively as the embryo. The shaping forces\nwhich have made our bodies and our minds what they are may always\nhave been partly psychical forces,\u2014from the first living slime-speck to\nthe complex intelligences of to-day.\nThis view is not inconsistent with the suggestion which I have made\nelsewhere, that the human spirit's supernormal powers of telepathy and\ntetesthesia are survivals from the powers which that spirit once exer\ncised in a transcendental world. It may well be that the spirit already\nmodified by cosmic experiences dating back to infinity may inform the\n1 To what extent the nature of the connexion between the maternal and the\nwnbryonic organism may modify the mechanism of suggestion this is not the place\nto inquire.\n2 d\n\f350 F. W. H. Myers.\nbody already modified by terrene experiences dating back to the first\nappearance of life on our planet. Both the old traducianist and the\nold transmigrationist view would thus possess a share of truth ; and the\nactual man would be the resultant not only of intermingling heredities\non father's and mother's side, but of intermingling heredities, one of\nplanetary and one of cosmic scope.\nI, at any rate, follow those who can see no fundamental dividing-line\nbetween the most purely intellectual act of memory,\u2014say the recollec\ntion of a mathematical formula,\u2014and the habit or predetermination\nwhich has made each new cell in a man's body take on the peculiarities\nof its predecessor,\u2014back till the time when the segments of the\nfertilised ovum took on the peculiarities of their progenitors. The\nintroduction of consciousness into this series is, I conceive, a quite\ngradual process ; our own human consciousness being merely a casual\nintermediate point between such dim unnamed self-awareness as may\npervade at least all sentient things, and that far intenser consciousness\nwhich mortal man forefeels only in some moment of ecstacy.\nThe physiological changes which follow upon self-suggestion\ndepend, in my view, upon a revival of memories which have long\nlapsed from supraliminal consciousness ; upon a recurrence to primitive\npowers, exercised in days when all that the organism had to attend to\nconsisted in processes of absorption, secretion, and so forth. And\nsomewhat similarly I hold that much which we now term hyperesthesia\nmay rather consist of some rudimentary sense of unfamiliar type\nderived from a primitive pancestltesia, or diffused undifferentiated\nsensibility, from which our special senses, and the special senses of\nother animals, have developed under the pressure of special needs.\nAs to telepathy and telresthesia, the case is different. I do not say\nthat these powers may not have existed in our lowly ancestors, or may\nnot now exist among the inferior animals, but I cannot regard them as\nfaculties dependent (as the senses are dependent) upon the vitalisation\nof matter. Rather I hold them as a part of our inheritance upon\nthe other\u2014-the cosmic\u2014side of our descent. They belong to the\ntranscendental world and to our transmigrationist pedigree ; and\nhave been, I take it, not fostered but concealed by this planetary\nalliance between spirit and matter.\nFor the present, however, our inquiry concerns the traducianist\naspect of heredity alone. We have to consider, that is to say,\nwhether any of the phenomena of retrocognition which lie before us\nare explicable as extensions of organic memory ;\u2014as evocations into\ndaylight consciousness of imprints made in this life, or in ancestral\nlives, upon our physical being. So much of intellectual predisposition\nis hereditary that it would be rash to fix d priori any point where a\nmemory was too definite to be capable of transmission. It is a\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 351\nquestion of evidence ; but I may say at once that for an ancestral\nmemory as definite as would here be needed there seems to me to be\nat present no adequate evidence, and that the hypothesis is worth\nmentioning mainly because any other explanation of some of these\nfacts or pictures from a remote past, with which we shall presently\nhave to deal, seems at first to be still more incredible.\nWhile, therefore, I do not at present see evidence that memories\neither of words or of scenes can be inherited, T think we ought to be\non the watch for cases like the following, where the writer, the Rev.\nW. S. Lach-Szyrma, believes that there was an innate cerebral picture,\ndue to parental suggestion :\u2014\nP. 252. Hereditary Memory.\nTo the Editor of the \" Joi-rnal of the Society for Psychical Research.\"\nSir,\u2014There is one obscure subject on which I should like to see an\ninquiry by the Society for Psychical Research. I mean hereditary memory.\nI know it is usually accepted, even by sceptical physiologists, that we\ninherit instincts and habits from our ancestors. The case of a hereditary\npassion for hunting in certain English families is adduced. Also certain\nacts, e.g., in women a peculiar mode of threading a needle (as in one branch\nof my own family) is hereditary. The Stuarts and Bourbons both had a\nmanifest and remarkable heredity of thought (which might result partly\nfrom instinct, partly from education). But may not this power of inheri\ntance extend still further, even to the recollection of certain places by\ndescendants, and may not this account for some cases at least of that well-\nknown mental phenomenon of persons feeling suddenly that they perfectly\nrecollect places and scenes where a moment's reflection shows that they\nhave never been in their lives ? I may explain what I mean by my own\nexperience.\nIn early childhood I was much given to day dreams, as many only\nchildren of active imaginations are. Two scenes have haunted me many\nhundred times, I am sure, though as I attained manhood they faded and\nwere only recollected as childhood's dreams. I will describe each of them.\nThey were two of my dominant scenes to the inner visual organs in child\nhood.\n1. A large village lying northward, with heaving plain and woodlands\nin the back. In front there is a little stream crossed by a small bridge. It\nis looked at from a hill. There is one church in that village, and a road\ngoing north, and a park to the east. I have thought of that village a\nhundred times and peopled it with imaginary people and quaint adventures,\nas children will.\nNow when I was an undergraduate in Oxford, my mother suggested my\ngoing to visit Adderbury, which had been connected with our family since\n1800, and where she had spent some of her childhood, staying with her\nuncle who dwelt there. She intended going herself there, but was pre\nvented. Still she told me to go there and see the old place, full of her\nchildhood's memories. I did so one winter's day. I came to a low hill, and\n2 d 2\n\f352 F. W. H. Myers.\nthere before me was almost exactly the scene of my childhood's dreams\u2014\nthe large village, the little stream, the park, the woodlands, and the church.\nNow my mother had never described to me Adderbury. It is curious I\nshould have thought of it, for, spending my childhood in Devon, I had\nconceived a typical Oxfordshire village, totally unlike any place I had seen\nin childhood.\n2. Another scene was more curious and more persistent. It was a large\nvillage near the sea, facing eastwards. The hill is very steep\u2014so steep that\nyou must descend part of the way by steps. The houses are in terraces one\nover the other. Above there is a woodland. I always thought I dwelt\nthere, and had a house on the north side. Hundreds of day dreams had I\nof that village and its steps and terraces, and blue sea, but my home was\nalways on the north side and a little inland. Till last July, I never in all\nmy journeys had seen any place like that scene of my day dreams. I was\nthen asked to visit Clovelly in Xorth Devon, where my maternal ancestors\n(my great grandmother was a Cary) had long lived. To my astonishment,\nthere were the terraces, the steep hill, the steps down to the sea facing east\nward, and to the north, Cary Court, where for ages our people had lived. I\nsaw in the church seven of the Cary tombs. Clovelly is described in West-\nward Ho, which I only read some years ago for the first time, and the\nresemblance never struck me.\nAre there not many other instances of this ancestral memory ?\nW. S. Lach-Szykma.\nNewlyn St. Peter, Penzance, February, 1890.\nThought-transference in childhood from the percipient's mother or\nother relatives might probably suffice to explain a case of this kind.\nAnd we shall find cases where a scene similarly viewed in advance can\nnever have been looked upon by any ancestor of the percipient's.\nLeaving now the question of an ancestral memory, let us speak of\nthe organic memory of impressions received by each man during his\nown past life. In my chapter on Hypermnesic Dreams, Proceeding*,\nVol. VIII., p. 362, I set forth evidence tending to show the possibility\nthat all definite sensory experiences of this present life may be pre\nserved in a subliminal memory. I would now suggest in addition that\nthere may be a conservation of the psychical aspect of the past organic\nsensation itself, as well as of the resultant condition from which that\npast sensation may be inferred. In the case of a pain, there will thus\nbe the instant pain, then its brief resonance through the organism,\nthen its permanent picture, so to call it, which can still be revived as\npainful, and lastly the symbolized memory, no longer actively painful,\nwhich we use when we wish to recall the fact of the pain. I speak\nfirst of a pain, since that is a comparatively definite thing, approaching\nnear to the sensations due to specialised end-organs, of which also we\nshall soon see that similar records remain. But I would extend this\nsuggestion to all states of organic sensibility, including, for instance,\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 353\nthe possible revival in adult life of the freshness of youth, or\nthe possible renewal of the sensation of hungry emptiness after a\ncopious meal.\nThe following cases illustrate what has Wen said, lxlth as to the\ncontinuous perception exercised by the subliminal self,\u2014none the less\nwhen the supraliminal self has been held in abeyance by chloroform,\u2014\nand also as to the possibility of a revival\u2014preferably in a half-dreaming\nstate, as with illusions hypnagogiques.\nThe cases were contributed by a surgeon, Associate of the S.P.R.\nP. 251.\nThe Subliminal Consciousness at Work during the Influence of an\nax.esthetic.\n(1) On November 3rd, 1893, a middle-aged woman was operated on for a\nbony tumour of the upper jaw. She was of course under an aiwesthetic.\nWhen she awoke, after completion of the operation, she said she had no\nrecollection whatever of what had occurred. When I called on her, on\nXovember 7th, she said she had had severe neuralgia during the night in the\nsituation of the operation. During the continuance of this pain, and while\nhalf awake and half asleep, she thought she could follow each step of the\noperation of November 3rd. She described the cutting and slipping of the\nsteel chisel, the blows of the mallet, and scraping back of the gum\u2014in fact,\nit seemed to her that she underwent the whole operation again.\n(2) A lady to whom I told the above said she once took \"gas\" for a tooth\nextraction. This was quite successful, for she \"felt nothing.\" But on an\noccasion subsequent to this she had a return of toothache\u2014some time in the\nnight. She declared that she could then feel all the symptoms of becoming\nunconscious while inhaling the gas ; then came the digging of the forceps to\nget a grip on the tooth, the wrench, and awful pain \u2014 every detail was \" felt \"\nnow, although her waking consciousness had been quite unaware of any pain\nduring the actual extraction.\n(3) I have many times noted that people while antusthetised, who do not\nfeel pain in the ordinary sense, and who on coming to themselves declare that\nthey did feel no pain during the operation, have struggled, groaned, spoken,\nor given some other evidence that some stratum of their consciousness was\nawake during the anesthesia, and was being impressed by the pain of the\noperation.\nThe above appears to show that the subliminal consciousness does take\nBote of what is going on, while the work-a-day self is oblivious to all external\nstimuli when under the influence of an anesthetic ; and that the memory of\nthis subliminal self may be brought to the surface by some appropriate\nstimulus, such as the neuralgia, which, we may note, occurred between sleep\ning and waking\u2014that is, at a time when the subliminal is more active than\nthe supraliminal stratum of our conscious personality.\nAnalogous to the foregoing is the fact similar in hypnotism, where it is\noften possible to recall a memory in the subject after awakening of what has\nheen done and said during his hypnosis.\n\f354 F. W. H. Myers.\nNote to Case I. \u2014The patient did not see the operator's instruments at all,\nnor was she told after the operation how it was done, but merely that the\ntumour had been cut away entirely and successfully. No one was present at\nthe operation except the patient, operator, and myself. The operation was\ndescribed by the patient as accurately as a non-medical person was likely to\ndo. It may be thought that she was enabled to describe the operation by her\nvivid imagination ; but under the circumstances I should regard this \"vivid\nimagination \" as only another name for her subliminal memory.\nWith regard to Case II., as I was not present during the extraction of the\nteeth, I know none of the details.\nIn each of these two cases I was of course careful not to suggest to the\npatient the details of the operation\u2014such as \" Did you feel this or that 1 \" I\nmerely asked them twice over to tell me what they felt. Both the patients\nwere thoroughly under the influence of the anesthetic\u2014chloroform in the\nfirst case, and nitrous oxide gas in the second.\nC. Theodore Green,\nM.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., London.\nSomewhat analogous to this revival in half-sleep of memories which\nanesthetics had till then obscured, is the occasional revival during\ndrowning\u2014or, in Charles Darwin's case, during a fall from a wall \u2014\nof a series of life-memories both swifter and fuller than conscious\neffort could have supplied. Such cases can hardly be recorded in\ndetail by the percipient himself, but they are numerous enough to make\nit pretty certain that the phenomenon is more than a mere subjective\nillusion. In a case which I have heard from a friend, nearly drowned\nin boyhood, the marked feature was the delightfulness of the panorama,\n\u2014a review of childish games, &c.\u2014rising in the effortless fashion of\nthat subliminal uprush which we term a flash of genius. I suspect\nthat similar resurgences of lapsed memory occur both in health and\nin disease more frequently than has yet been observed. Almost any\nmental tempest may bring remote impressions to light,\u2014as storms will\nwash up cannon-balls on a long-since bombarded shore. \" I knew one\nman,\" says Dr. Olouston (Mental Diseases, p. 147), \"who, as he was\npassing into mania, could repeat a whole play of Shakespeare or a book\nof Milton, which when well he could not do.\"1\nSomewhat akin to this is the following case of revival during health,\n\u2014and during the deep sleep in which changes of personality are\ngenerally effected,\u2014of a special vividness of youthful memories. The\n1 With quite healthy persons sudden and insistent memories sometimes occur,\nwith details fuller than could have been voluntarily called up. Thus a young officer\nrecounts the following experience, undergone while he was reading in bed, awake\nand with calm mind :\u2014\" Everything that had happened since I first went to sea\nflashed before me like a dissolving view ; places, events, faces, names, everything.\nThis lasted for over an hour, and then the picture faded away, and nothing but a\nblurred impression remained. The effect it had on me made me feel uncomfortable\nfor a couple of days afterwards.\"\n\fThe SiMiminal Self. 355\naccompanying telepathic phenomenon,\u2014the discharge, if we may so\nterm it, of telergic energy,\u2014perhaps testifies to the profound character\nof the shock; as when similar phenomena occur at a moment of ex\nternal crisis, or at the change of death.\nL 984. At Po Auditory.\nFrom Mrs. Manning, who writes to Professor James as follows :\u2014\n105, Winter Street, Portland, Maine, October 28th [1894].\nDear Sir,\u2014At the request of Colonel Woodhull, I send you the following\nstatement, which I hope may be of use to you.\nWhen I was a child at my home in RcKhester, N.Y., my elder sister had\nalmost entire care of me. At night, after putting me in bed, she would sit\nbeside me for a few moments until I fell asleep. Frequently I would wake\nup, and finding myself alone and in the dark, of which I was much afraid, I\nwould call out to her ; she would come and soothe me to sleep again. In\n1875, I was living at Fort Hartsuff, Nebraska, a military post, the station of\nmy husband. Our nearest railway station was Grand Island, on the Union\nPacific Railroad, 75 miles away. My sister then lived at Omaha, about 300\nmiles east of Grand Island. Our mail reached us by buckboard from Grand\nIsland every Wednesday and Saturday. One night in November, I awoke\nfrom a dreamless sleep, wide awake, and yet to my own consciousness the\nlittle child of years ago, in my own room in the old home ; the sister had\ngone, and I was alone in the darkness. I sat up in bed, and called with all\nmy voice, \"Jessie ! Jessie !\"\u2014my sister's name. This aroused my husband,\nwho spoke to me. I seemed to come gradually to realisation of my\nsurroundings, and with difficulty adjusted myself to the present. In that\nmoment I seemed to live again in the childhood days and home. I cannot\nexpress too strongly the feeling of actuality I had. For days after this the\nstrange impression was with me, and I could recall many little incidents and\nscenes of child-life that I had entirely forgotten.\nI wrote to my sister the next day, and told her of the strange experience\nof the night before. In a few days I received a letter from her, the date the\nsame as mine, and having passed mine on the way, in which she said that\nsuch a strange thing had happened the night before\u2014that she had boon\nawakened by my voice calling her name twice ; that the impression was so\nstrong that her husband went to the door to see if it could possibly be I. No\none else had called her ; she had not been dreaming of me. She distinctly\nrecognised my voice.\nMary M. Cxarkson Manning.\nCaptain Manning writes :\u2014\nPortland, Me., October 29th, 1894.\nI distinctly recall the circumstances as related above by my wife.\nW. C. Manning\n(Captain 23rd Infantry, U.S. Army).\nMrs. Manning's sister and brother-in-law give their testimony as follows :\u2014\nDetroit, Mich., November 1st, 1894.\nThe statement made by my sister is as I remember the experience.\n\f356 F. W. U. Myers.\nThat it made a deep impression upon us both is evidenced by each writing\nof it to the other on the day following its occurrence. The impression made\nwas so forcible, it has never been forgotten.\nJessie Clarkson Thraix.\nDetroit, Mich., November 1st, 1894.\nThe within statement of a curious coincidence might have been forgotten\nby me during the past twenty years, had the facts not been recalled to my\nmemory from time to time as they have by the principal actors in it. I have\nalways regarded it as a strange coincidence, but nothing more.\nI heard no call, but went to the door to satisfy my wife that her sister\nwas not in the hall. George Thrall\nIn reply to Dr. Hodgson's enquiries, Mrs. Manning informed him that\nthe original letters referred to had been destroyed long ago, and that neither\nshe herself nor her sister had ever had any similar experience.\nStill more noticeable is another group of cases where the recent\nimpressions are in various ways suppressed in favour of the old. 'We\nare familiar, in the first place, with what is termed ecmnesia,\u2014the gap\nsometimes left in memory after a blow on the head, or even after a\nsudden emotional shock,\u2014which gap may or may not include a period of\ntime before the shock as well as after it, and may or may not be ulti\nmately filled up by a slow or hidden influx of recollection. The super\nposition of memories, so to term it, may in such cases be very curious.\nSuppose that 1 have an ecmnesic gap from Monday to Thursday ; I\nshall tack on the events of Thursday to the events of Monday, and\nshall regard them as continuous ;\u2014taking up the brain-cells, so to say,\nat the point where Monday left them. But all the time a true memory\nof Tuesday and Wednesday will have formed itself and will be waiting\nto appear ; so that perhaps on Saturday I shall discover that my brain\non Thursday was by no means, as I had imagined, still in its Monday\ncondition. Yet I have been working on Thursday and Friday upon\nthe basis of the old Monday brain-condition which, in an ordinary\nview, would be held to have been irrevocably altered by Tuesday's\nevents, and thus to have passed away for ever.\nThe various forms and stages of double personality, so often men\ntioned in these Proceedings, exhibit a similar phenomenon. Louis\nViv6, for example (Proceedings, Vol. IV., p. 29, &c.), could, by certain\nempirical processes, be made a boy again at will, reverting to the\nmemory and character belonging to the age at which any given\ndistribution of his defective nervous energy had last prevailed in his\norganism. Or, again, in a case observed by Dr. Pitres, of Bordeaux,\n(Revue de V'Hypnotisme, January, 1891, p. 201), the recovery of\nyouthful sensation and nervous integrity was the affair of a moment.\n\" When the patient is carried back by her delirium [or by suggestion] to\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 357\nthe time when she was six or seven years old, not only does she express\nherself and amuse herself like a child, but her hemianesthesia has\ndisappeared, and her hysterogenous zones, very active in her ordinary\nlife, have lost their excitability.\"\nI will add another example which may tend to show that these\nrenewals of former states of organic sensation affect the whole system\nin a way that no voluntary effort of mind can rival. Hardly anything\naffects our normal ccencesthesia or general organic sensations more deeply\nthan the alternation of hunger and repletion. Yet the elder Despine,\na most careful observer, reports as follows as regards the changes\neffected by light hypnotic trance in his well-known patient \" Estelle.\"\n\" The aliments,\" he says (Medeciiie Pratique, p. 47) \" taken in\nabundance during the trance ^when she was able to eat freely] did not\nseem to have satisfied her in the smallest degree on her return to the\nwaking state, and vice versd. In fact, whenever Estelle passed from\none of these conditions to the other, she never failed to experience in\nher new form of existence the physical appetites and needs appropriate\nto the new state. How did her digestive organs arrange themselves to\neffect this singular phenomenon ? Where did all the food go which had\nassuaged the devouring hunger of the state of trance?\u2014and how could\nall those cold drinks of beer, coffee, snow and ice, milk of almonds,\nraspberry vinegar, and so forth, leave room a few moments afterwards\nfor the thin broths of herbs, &c., and the vegetables which in her nor\nmal state had long formed her only nourishment ; and all this when\nthe food taken in the trance could not possibly have been so far\ndigested as to allow any appetite to be felt ? \"\nAllied, I think, to this power of subliminally arresting and recalling\nwganic sensations which for the waking self are lost beyond discovery,\nis a phenomenon for which there is some evidence in the records of\nearly mesmerism. I mean the power possessed by some entranced\npatients of a self-diagnosis profounder (as some physicians then said)\nthan medical skill could have attained. Such self-diagnosis of the\npatient is still sought and obtained with success by Janet and others\nin the special case of hysteria ; where the hysteric, under skilful\nhypnotic treatment, can recall and reveal the long-forgotten incident\nwhich started her malady. I believe that a similar subliminal history\nof their disease might be educed with advantage from some hypnotised\npatients of other types.1\nThere is a further degree, yet more important, to which this organic\ntetrocognition may, I believe, be carried. Readers of Professor Richet's\narticle in Proceedings, 'Vol. V., p. 18 foil., will remember that a long\n1 A curious case of subliminal medical guidance will be found in Proceedings,\nVol VI., p. 206.\n\f358 F.

Myera.\ninquiry,\u2014more careful, probably, than any inquiry on this subject had\never previously been,\u2014convinced that physiologist of the occasional\nreality of a claim which no doubt has -been often fraudulently made ;\u2014\nthe claim, namely, of a clairvoyant insight into the organic condition\nof an absent person. Here, of course, we come to a definitely super\nnormal power ; and it is a power which claims to involve both\nbackward and forward knowledge such as actual medical examination\nof the patient could not attain. On this point I add one further case\nof Professor Richet's.\nM C1- 67\u00b0- Paris, le 8 Mars, 1889.\nJ'ai un tr\u00e8s beau cas de lucidit\u00e9, que je vais vous raconter avec d\u00e9tail.\nVous ne savez peut-\u00eatre pas que mon beau-p\u00e8re, Mr. F.

(gigned) Ch Richet\nLet us now turn from these diffused organic sensations and\nmemories to those more definite sensations and memories which are\nreceived by the end-organs and stamped upon the brain. For simpli\ncity's sake I shall generally take the sense of sight as representative of\nall the senses.\nAnd here at once I may distinguish three different stages of visual\nmemory, often apprehended with some confusion.1 First comes that\nperipheral or entoptic memory which consists in the short-lived per\nsistence of a retinal impression as a true after image, which passes\nthrough certain physiological stages and then disappears, so far as we\nknow, altogether. This may be compared with the actual primary\npain itself, which presently dies away. Next to this comes another\nform of \" brute \" or unintelligent memory, which is often confounded\n*ith the first, but which is in fact quite distinct from the ordinary\nretinal after-image, and far more permanent. This is, if I may\nso term it, a cerebral after-image ; a persisting possibility of the\nresurgence of a complex scene just as it presented itself in the visual\nfield, and perhaps with details now discernible which were not\nfittingly noted at the time. This kind of photographic or phono\ngraphic after-image need not involve any intellectual selective action.\nIt forms a treasure-house from which illusions hypnagogiquet, crystal-\nvisions, and other sensory automatisms seem often to be drawn2 ; nor\ndo we know any necessary limit to this revival. The following cases\ntrom Professor Hyslop may serve as examples of these cerebral\nafter-images.\nlOn this subject see Proceedings, Vol. X., pp. 134-148 (viz., the chapter on the\nPkntiotogy of Hallucination!.)\nSee Proceeding!, Vol. VIII., pp. 449-155.\n\f360 F. W. H. Myers.\nP. 171. Columbia College, New York,\nMay 19th, 1893.\nMy Dear Hodgson,\u2014I enclose an interesting experience of one of my\nstudents, who asks that his name shall not be used. I should say regarding\nit that he told me the incident a day or two after it occurred, and remarked,\nwhat he has not included in his present account ; namely, that the colours\nstood out clear in the after-images, if the impressions or apparitions may \\k\ncalled that. The case thus bears a close relation to positive after images,\nthough experienced at an unusual interval after the original impression.\nJ. H. Htslof.\nMay 18th, 1893.\nDr. Hyslop,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014You asked me to write out my \" experience \"\non St. Patrick's day some time ago, and it was my forgetfulness and pro\ncrastination which prevented me from doing so. Here it is. On last St.\nPatrick's day, March 17th, 1893, I left college early in the afternoon,\ncutting my laboratory work in chemistry. I went through to Fifth Avenue,\nas I had an errand to do over on Sixth. When I struck Fifth I saw part of\nthe parade of the loyal sons of St. Patrick, with their green sashes, banners\nwith harps surmounted by fools' caps, and all the other paraphernalia. I\nthink I then walked up a couple of blocks and walked through to Sixth to\ndo my errand. I am certain of doing the errand, but do not quite recollect\nwhat streets I went through. When I had finished my errand, I walked\ndirectly to my house, 17, East 55th Street, and when I crossed the Avenue,\nFifth, (on my way home), the parade had passed, so between the time when\nI last saw them and the time when I entered my house, I should say that a\nfull quarter of an hour elapsed. Meanwhile, the parade had quite\npassed out of my consciousness. But as I was going up my front stairs,\nwhich are quite dark, I got a distinct picture of the paraders, green sashes,\nbanners and all,\u2014seemingly projected on the dark wall paper with which\nthe hall is covered. The picture was so vivid for an instant that it seemed\nas if I could see the features of the paraders' faces.\nThis is as detailed an account as I can give of the circumstance, and there\nis one particular in which my memory plays me false in a singular way. I\ncould not state which way the paraders were going, although I think it was\nuptown.\nColumbia College, New York, May 19th, 1893.\nMy Dear Hodgson,\u2014I may add to this a frequent experience\nof my own when a boy. I was in the habit of attending the country\nfairs with my parents. There were exhibitions of stock, farm pro\nduce and machinery, etc. I suppose I was about 10 or 12 years of\nage. The music given on such occasions was by an ordinary brass or\ncornet band, which always had a strong attraction for mo, and I\nlistened to it in preference to doing anything else, though I have no doubt\nnow that it was of a bad quality and poor in selection. But nevertheless it\nhad a fascination for me. I always observed that for hours after I could\nhear the bands playing their music. My home was seven miles distant, and\non the way thither in returning, and after my return, I could hear the\nsounds of the music. It was not an ordinary case of imagination and\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 361\nmemory, but more like real sound, though I distinctly remember Wing\nunder no illusion as to its purely subjective nature. I recognised that it\nwas not a real sound, and so the experience had not that feature of a\nhallucination which causes it to be mistaken for a reality. I knew that it\nwas not real, and that it was merely internal. It was not so distinct as an\nobjectire sound, but was like the continuance of a sensation after the\nstimulus is gone, less vivid than before. But it was a sound of a kind that\nI could not get rid of, and was no doubt an extraordinary case of after-image\ninhearin\u00ab- J. H. Hyslof.\nBut meantime a process has begun as to which physiology can tell\nus nothing, and of which psychology describes, under the name of\nAttention, a small part alone. A selection is made among the countless\ndetails with which the brain has been stored ; a synthetized and\nabbreviated memory reduces the unmanageable complexity to orderly\nusefulness. Unconsciously we chew the cud of recollection ; and when\nany picture is again summoned up to the surface it is found to have\nassumed a more or less symbolic form, appropriate to the furniture of\neach man's mind. It is this symbolized or organised memory on which\nwe practically live ; and every day a fresh portion of these digested\nmemories becomes, so to say, absorbed into our system ; influencing our\naaracter, or habit of reaction to psychical stimuli, but no longer dis\ntinguishable from our central consciousness any more than food when\ndigested into chyle is any longer distinguishable from the eater. At\nvhich stage3 in this mnemonic process, then, do we find evidence of\nsupernormal action, as of hypermnesia, or of telepathic perception of\ntie content of other minds 1\nWith the mere retinal memory, in the first place, we are here little\nconcerned. Some ingenious experiments on its prolongation have been\nquoted elsewhere.1 But, however prolonged, it will still be character\nistic; a mere retinal after-image is not likely to be mistaken for a super\nnormal image.\nWith cerebral after-images the case is quite different. It is plain\nthat if these persist for some days or months in latency and then\n'suddenly reappear, say in a crystal-vision, the \" scryer \" may well have\nforgotten that he ever witnessed the scene, and may take the mere\nbrute memory for a revelation of facts unknown.\nIt must be remembered, moreover, that these resurgent pictures are\nnot always exact reproductions of the primary impression. On the\ncontrary, they have often undergone some subliminal modification,\u2014\niidtlligent but not reasonable,\u2014a dream-like change, for which no mind\nexcept our own need be held responsible. Just as, for instance, the\nfaces which some people see in the dark generally present some slightly\ni Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 450.\n\f362 F. W. H. Myers.\nnovel combination of features in themselves familiar, so also do crystal-\nvisions often contain some merely fantastic element. The seer must\ntherefore be on his guard against supposing that if, for instance, he sees\na familiar scene with new details, those details must needs represent\nany fact whatever.\nThese, then, are forms of retrocognition which it is needful here to\ndistinguish and specify, but which may henceforth be left aside from\nour inquiry. What we wish to study is the retrocognition which depends\non the exercise of supernormal powers,\u2014on telepathy or on telsesthesia ;\n\u2014on the perception by us of knowledge contained in other minds,\nembodied or disembodied, and possibly on the absorption by us of\nknowledge afloat, so to say, in the Universe ;\u2014which may be grasped by\nour spirit's outreaching, or which may fall on us like dew.\nI will begin with a group of cases which seem to illustrate both\ntelresthetic and telepathic faculty, and which may serve as a watershed\nfrom which we may descend on either side in turn. They are cases,\nmoreover, which approach somewhat closely from the intellectual side\nthose cases of organic retrocognition which we have already discussed.\nFor the idea that it may be possible to review or retrocognise a man's\ngrosser corporeal conditions by merely contemplating the man or some\nobject pertaining to him naturally suggests the question whether, if\nthe past state of his lungs or stomach be thus discernible, the past\nstate of his consciousness may not be so too. Thoughts and emotions\nhave left traces on his nervous system ; nay, on his spirit ; in some\nsense they still exist; are these decipherable by any seer's inward\neye t This question opens the way to a crowd of answers which\nfall short of actual evidence. Sudden unreasoning sympathies\nand antipathies may be striking enough to those who feel them :\nbut it is impossible with such vague phenomena to be sure of\nmarking the misses as well as the hits.\nHere is a case which suggests some slight retrocognitive power\nunder hypnotism.\nP. 243.\nFrom Dr. Van Eeden, of Amsterdam, Corresponding Member of the\nS.P.R.\nThe following, says Dr. Van Eeden, is a very strange case of telepathic\ninfluence, to the exact truth of which I can however testify :\u2014\nOn January 11th, 1892, I treated Miss M. for hysteric aphonia.\nI sent her to sleep in my own study. As she showed signs of simulation,\nand seemed to need an energetic treatment, I threatened to throw a glass of\ncold water in her face, if she did not speak immediately in a clear voice.\nI was obliged to fultil the threat with the expected result. She awoke ami\nspoke in a clear loud voice. This was the first time in five years' practice\nthat I took this measure, and I told nobody of it.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 36:i\nOn January 13th, I treated Miss F. in the same chair in my study.\nI had treated this lady several times before in the same place, and she always\nwent into a quiet sleep. But this time she told me after the treatment that\nher sleep had been very much disturbed. For she had heard me saying in a\nthreatening voice : \"I shall awake you by throwing a glass of cold water in\njour face. \" And as she is very afraid of cold water, she was in constant fear\nand uneasiness. Now I had said nothing of the sort, had not left her, and\nhad not spoken to anybody of the occurrence with Miss M. two days before.\nMiss F. often hears voices in her sleep, but seldom so clearly as this time.\nF. v. E.\nThe above statement is the literal translation, (made in 1892 for the\nS.P.R.) of the note I took down immediately after the occurrence of the\nincident related.\nI add the version of Miss F. , written now (1895) while she is staying in\nmy house, I having asked for her corroboration. I seem to have been\nmistaken in the notion that she had heard me threatening her. This mistake\nis the result of my impression of her fright, which struck me principally.\nAccording to her version, I was [in her hallucination] speaking to somebody\nelse, and on this point she is positive. As for me, I am absolutely sure I did\nnot say anything of the kind, during her sleep, nor did I mention the fact\nto anyone.\nAugust 13th, 1895. F. v. E.\nThe corroboration of Miss F. runs as follows :\u2014\nOften, during my sleep, I hear at a distance different voices speaking, \u2014\nthough not to myself.\nOn the above-mentioned date I heard distinctly the voice of Dr. van\nEeden saying: \"And so I threw a cup of water into her face.\" As I\nhare a particular dislike to being frightened, I thought at that moment how\nvery angry I should be if he should behave so badly towards me !\nBussum, August 13th, 1895. A. F.\n[Miss F. gave me orally (at Utrecht, September 19, 1895) an interesting\naccount of her somewhat unusual experience under hypnotism. There\nis no trance, and no break in memory, but a unique rush of illusions\nhiipmgogiques, among which the impression above related was specially\ndistinct.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nThere are, however, a few cases of a much stronger kind,\nwhere a definite fact in a man's life has manifested itself phantasmally\nto a sensitive's gaze. Thus Miss X. recounts (Proceedings, Vol.\nXI., p. 125) the vision of a striking picture of long-past disgrace,\nin the close vicinity of an acquaintance whom she had no reason to\nconnect with any such scene. Similarly Dr. D. J. Parsons, of Sweet\n,Springs, Missouri, published in the Medical Brief for May, 1891, a long\naccount of retrocognitive perceptions of a similar kind. As has been\nthe case with many of our informants, it was not until lately that\nDr. Parsons recognised that such experiences could have a scientific\n\f364 F. W. H. Myers.\ninterest; and most of his cases are remote and now incapable of\ncorroboration. I select for quotation a case which is well confirmed,\nand where the oddness of the emergent symbol seems to preclude\nmere chance coincidence.\nP. 172.\nD. J. Parsons, M.D., Sweet Springs, Mo., writes as follows in The\nMedical Brief, April, 1891 :\u2014\nTwenty years after my first experience I learned that I could see things\nmentally, I will call it, just as others had seen them many years before and\nhundreds of miles distant. To illustrate : While in company with Dr.\nTrotter, of Lexington, Mo. , I could see before and near to him a delicate\nhand on which was a dark red kid glove. The hand was all the time in\nmotion. I called his attention to it and he was much surprised. I told him\nthe hand had a history, and if he had no objections I would be pleased to\nknow ic. He said, \"I was travelling in Canada, on the cars, and one day\nwe ran up to a train that had been wrecked a little while before. I went to\nthe wreck and about the first thing I saw was a young lady lying upon the\nground dead ; one hand was naked and the other was covered with a dark red\nkid glove.\" Instantly upon his uttering the words, the dark red kid glove\nand the hand vanished.\nDr. D. J. Parsons writes to Dr. Hodgson from Sweet Springs, Mo. ,\nJune 2oth, 1891.\nRichard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014In regard to Dr. Trotter's case I would\nstate, in addition to what I have written, that the Doctor came into the drug\nstore where he found me alone on one Sunday morning, and we talked for\nabout an hour, the gloved hand all the time present and in motion. The\ndinner bell was rung, he going to dinner and I going home. I returned\nabout half-past one and immediately he called in. Saw the hand all the time\nsoon as he entered, as before. I then' called his attention to it as stated.\nMy experience has taught me to believe that the hand would have returned\nwith the Doctor perhaps hundreds of times, or until he explained to me the\ncause of its presence. Soon as he uttered the words dark glove, it vanished ;\nwould never appear again under any circumstances.\nDr. Trotter writes from Lexington, Mo. :\u2014 July 12th 1891\nR. Hodgson, Esq.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014The circumstance to which you refer,\nconnected with Dr. D. J. Parsons, of Sweet Springs, Mo., is indeed very\nremarkable\u2014the gloved hand. The following is about the way it occurred.\nAbout the year 1852, I was travelling on the (then) Great Western R.R.,\nCanada, when one of the worst R.R. accidents occurred in the annals of R.\nRoading, known as the Baptist's Creek accident. Over 70 were killed\noutright, and about 100 wounded. I saw them all and there were many\nhorrible and striking sights, all of which passed out of my mind, excepting\none : it was the corpse of what had been a very handsome young lady, who\nhad had a beautiful hand ; her right hand was lying across her chest with a\nfine neat glove, her left was bare. The gloved hand made a strong im\npression on me which has remained to this day, about 40 years. I have no\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 365\nrecollection of ever mentioning it to any one till some 10 or 12 years ago to Dr.\nParsons. We had been intimate friends for years, and had talked a great\ndeal on various subjects, Spiritualism among the rest. One day he said to\nme, \"Doctor, there is something connected with a glove which has made a\nstrong impression upon your mind.\" These are about his exact words. It\nastounded me, and I hadn't to think a second to tell him thero was, and I\ntold him the circumstances, and that the sight of the gloved hand clung to\nme, and I will say does so yet. It has been a great wonder to me how Dr.\nParsons referred to it. He certainly never got the idea from any physical\nsource.\u2014Very respectfully, R Trottbr\nP.S.\u2014You are at liberty to use this as you think proper.\u2014It.T.\nThese two cases, of the boy \" running the gauntlet,\" and of the\nred glove, illustrate better than any others in my possession the\nsuggested adherence of phantasmal scenes to a living person,\u2014or, say\ntheir inherence in that person,\u2014with no suggestion of spirit agency.1\nIt is plain, on the other hand, that where instead of a glove, or a\npicture of A himself in the past, it is the phantom of a deceased\nperson which is thus seen in the neighbourhood of a living one, we can\nno longer feel confident that it is the living man's memory only\nwhich is at work. But there is no need, I say, to suppose that the\nred glove implied the presence of the spirit of its quondam owner.\nWe may regard it as a psychical image accompanying the man in\nwhose memory it was lodged, although as imperceptible to ordinary\nobservers as the special scent by which a bloodhound would have\ntracked his footsteps along a crowded street. Nor need we, on such\nan analogy, suppose that such trace can be left only by the presence\nof the living man himself. His cap or glove will give trace enough\nfor the hound to follow his movements,\u2014to reconstruct his life from\nthe hound's point of view; and similarly there may be signs in the\nman's body or environment which may afford a transcendental trace,\nfrom which his history may be reconstructed by a gaze which is not of\nthe eye alone.2\nThis influence of material objects in facilitating retrocognitive\ntelssthesia has been already more than once discussed in connection\n1 For a discussion by Miss X. of alternative explanations of such pictures, see\nPnutdingi, Vol. XI., p. 114 foil. And compare a case quoted by Mr. Podmore,\nPrvxtding!, VoL VI., p. 286.\n2 It is worth noting that this is precisely what ^Eschylus suggests when he makes\nthe phantom of Clytemnestra appeal to the sleeping Eumenides to recognise, by the\ninternal visions of their profound sleep, the long-past source of the wounds which she\nshows in her breast.

For the present I will\nmerely refer to two cases, both of them from informants with whose\nnames the readers of these Proceedings are already familiar. The\nfirst, the tracing of the history of a ring, will be found in a paper\nsigned J. M. Soames, in the Contemporary Review (1891), whose\nauthor\u2014his real name is Major Schreiber\u2014is known to me. The\ncase is remote and now hardly capable of corroboration, but it seems\nto have been carefully observed and described. (See Proceedings,\nVol. VIII., p. 526.)\nThe next case is from Mr. Dobbie, a correspondent known to\nmany of us, and of whose conscientious care we feel assured. It is\nquoted by Mrs. Sidgwick in Proceedings, Vol. VII., p. 65.\nIn these and similar cases the inanimate object is regarded as\nleading to a knowledge of part of the history of persons connected\nwith it. But it is sometimes asserted that the inanimate object\nreveals its own history,\u2014suggesting scenes in which, perhaps, no\nhuman being has token part. This further claim, I think, is simply a\nmatter of evidence, and it is as yet quite insufficiently supported.\nOne might regard it as consistent with a view of the universe as a\ncompletely conservative system, that record should somehow persist,\neven of scenes which have never been reflected in human minds.\nHuman minds probably constitute but an infinitesimal fraction of the\nmind in the Universe. But as to whether a record formed apart\nfrom human minds can be readied by human minds or no ;\u2014that, I\nrepeat, may be discussed with more profit when better evidence than\nnow exists for so extreme an assumption shall have been produced.1\nBut now, continuing our survey of modes of retrocognition which\ndo not directly depend upon telepathy, we come to two groups of\nphenomena which, as far back as the publication of PJiantusms of the\nLiving, seemed hardly to fall under the heading of Transmission from\nMind to Mind, which that book was primarily intended to prove.\nEdmund Gurney has there said much as to \" telepathic clairvoyance,\"\nand something also (Vol. II., p. 365, sqq.) as to \"a curious little\ngroup of cases in which it is difficult or impossible to assign the\nimpression to the ' agency ' of any particular person, and which recall\nthe Greek notion of *w\u00bb7\u2014the rumour which spreads from some\nunknown source, and far outstrips all known means of transport.\"\nIn crude language, there are cases where a living man's spirit seems to\nwander about and pick up knowledge for itself, and cases where it\nseems to sit at home while knowledge flows in upon it from no trace-\n1 The works on this subject by Buchanan and Denton lack precision and\ncorroboration from the evidential point of view.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 367\nable source. The dividing lines of hypothetical classes of this sort are\nof course obscure ; but I may say that the cases given in Mrs.\nSidgwick's paper on Clairvoyance (Proceedings, Vol. VII., p. 30),\nbelong mainly to the former of these two groups,\u2014sometimes called\nTravelling Clairvoyance ;\u2014of which, again, we shall in this paper hear\nmore when we come to discuss precognition. For the moment I turn\nto the second class ; \u2014the passive reception of impressions which no\nassignable mind, incarnate or discarnate, can plausibly be supposed to\nhave transmitted. Convenience demands a name for this class ; and\nnew words of fresh derivation and definite meaning do assuredly save\nmore trouble in the end than they give at the beginning. The early\nChristians used the terra Koo-il.onadi)s for a man readily affected by\nimpressions from the surrounding world. I therefore propose to term\nthese experiences cosmopathic ;\u2014impressions which come to men from\nthe transcendental environment ; borne like seed on the wind, rather\nthan wittingly directed towards him by the voluntary or involuntary\nsympathy of any assignable intelligence. In this class I should place\nthe several instances quoted by Mr. Gurney (loc. cit.) where a sudden\nand true impression of the death of some distinguished personage\ncomes to a percipient with no special interest in the event.1 Various\ncrystal visions already published seem to fall under this category, and\nseveral narratives quoted in this paper may be so interpreted. But\noften a link of some kind can be found ; and we may well suppose\nthat such links may be differently perceived, and may link human\nspirits in unguessed ways, in the subliminal world.\nL 976.

Van\nDeusen, of 600, Addison Avenue, Albany.\nMr. Van Deusen writes :\u2014 T oril, iQOo\nJanuary 30th, 1893.\nI am a collector, and of late a dealer, in old china.

They fully remember the circumstances,\nand their evidence is made the more valuable by the fact that not only did they then\nregard Mr. Young's narrative of his experience as pointless ;\u2014but even now that the\ncoincidence is known\u2014and by them inexplicable\u2014they take no interest in the matter.\nSee, also, a ease in the S.P.R.

Some 14 months since, I found an article in Scribncr's Magazine\nbearing on the subject, and written by Mrs. A., of Brooklyn, an entire\nstranger to me. I wrote Mrs. A. at the time, and may have received three\nto five letters from her, all of which are brief and pertaining strictly to our\ncommon interest. Once, when in New York city, I called upon Mrs. A. at\nher Brooklyn home, meeting only her, and of course learning nothing of her\nfamily. At this call Mrs. A. expressed a desire to possess a certain specimen,\nwhich I found later on ; and, having a trip to town in view, decided to again\ncall and tell her of it. Arrived at the house, I was told by a maid that Mrs.\nA. 's son was very ill, and that she saw no one. In response to an inquiry, I\nwas told that they then regarded him as improving. I thus left the house\nwith the impression that he was on the road to recovery. During the next\ntwo or three weeks I frequently considered the advisability of writing, but\nhesitated for some time, fearing to intrude so trifling a matter at a time of\nanxiety and care. I, however, received a complimentary copy of her book\nChina Collecting in America, at this time, and acknowledged the same in a\nnote, expressing hope of recovery, &c. Very shortly after this, I awoke one\nmorning at an earlier hour than usual (why I knew not), and fell into a doze,\nfrom which I was wakened at about seven by the announcement, in a low\nvoice, close to my right ear, \" Willie A. died this morning at tinl o'clock.\"\nI never for a moment doubted that my wife, who sleeps in an adjoining\nroom, had been in and told me. It is her custom to wake me very gently,\nand I believed I heard her voice. I \"gathered\" myself rather slowly,\nwondering how Mrs. Van Dousen could have received the information. The\nacquaintance between Mrs. A. and myself was of the sort described, and\nthere was no reason why any notification of this death should be sent us. I\nwent out into the hall, met my wife, and asked the question, only to receive\nfrom her the startled reply, \"Who is dead?\" when mutual explanations and\nastonishment ensued. I was so impressed with the precise and emphatic\ncharacter of the announcement that I mentioned it to two or three friends,\nand sought to find out if it was true. I was only able to learn that the lad\ndied that night. On my next meeting with Mrs. A. this fall, I asked if the\nname of her son was Willie, and on hearing that it was not, I then explained\nmy reason for asking, when Mrs. A. told me that her son did die at two\no'clock that morning. Mrs. A. then volunteered the information that she had\nheard a similar case in connection with the death of her son.\nI fancy that I was too heavy with sleep to catch the first word of the\nsentence\u2014note its order. This is the only instance of the sort that ever\nhappened to me.\nIt happened that friends came to us the day that I received the notifica\ntion of Mrs. A.'s son's death, and I mentioned the fact to them. I was\nsick most of that day\u2014a peculiar nervous dyspepsia and accompanying\ndisturbance. I knew this was not due to the knowledge of this boy's death.\nThere was no reason why I should feel his death. I think I was not much\nimpressed with the occurrence until it became the subject of talk.\nDo you suppose that the disturbance of my nervous centres was in any\nway connected with the incident, and if so, how? I am 33 years old, and am\nfairly strong.\nRobert Thompson Van Dei-sen.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 309\nIn a later communication, Mr. Van Deusen said that he was unable to\ngive the exact date of his experience, having made no note of it. After\nascertaining that it was on the same morning that the boy died, he ceased to\nfeel any active interest in it.\nIn reply to Dr. Hodgson's request for corroboration, Mrs. Van Deusen\nwrote :\u2014\nThe Addison, Middlebury, Vt., March 3Ut. 1893.\nDear Sir, \u2014Your letter to Mr. Van Deusen requesting a statement from\nme was duly received.\nI have a distinct recollection of my husband's asking me that morning\nwhether I had told him of the death of Mrs. A.'s son, and his surprise at\nmy reply that I had not been in the room, and knew nothing of it. Indeed,\nI did not even know she had a son, so slight was the acquaintance. I only\nknow of Mrs. A. as one of Mr. Van Deusen's customers. My husband\nseemed much impressed with the occurrence, and we talked more or less of\nit at the time. It gradually passed out of our minds until two or three\nmonths later, when during a call on Mrs. A. he mentioned the circumstances\nand learned the correctness of the intelligence. So much time has since\npassed, that it is impossible to recall names of those to whom it was told.\nMrs. William O. Stillman remembers the occurrence, and I presume our\nmaid, who was much in the dining-room in attendance on the table, might\nremember it, but she has left me, and I have not her address.\nMr. Van Deusen wrote to Mrs. A. for permission to give her address, as\nyou requested, but has received no reply. Alys B Deusen\nDr. Hodgson wrote to Mrs. Stillman, asking for her recollections of the\noccurrence, and received the following reply :\u2014\n287, State Street, Albany, February 27th, 1893.\nDear Mr. Hoihison,\u2014This morning I received your note about Mr. Van\nDeusen's experience, and regret I made no note at the time. He told me\nthe day after he received the impression that a voice said to him the night\nbefore : \"Little Willie A. died at o'clock.\" He told me the hour, but\nI have forgotten it. Shortly afterwards he said to me that he heard from\nMrs. A that the hour at which her little boy died was the hour he had\nheard, and I was quite struck by the coincidence. \u2014Very truly yours,\nFrances Stiixman.\nIt must be noted here, I repeat, that there had in fact been some\nslight link between the dying boy's mother and the percipient ; and\nthat, for aught we know, this connexion may have been more operative\nbelow than above the conscious threshold.\nAnd similarly in cases where a man has a vision of some incident\nat a distance ;\u2014say of some accident in which he is not directly\nconcerned ;\u2014one can still say that the event was one which it would\nhave interested him to see, which might have attracted his telcesthetic\nattention, so to term it, in sleep.\nBoth this and the following case resemble the dream (Phantasms\nof the Living, Vol. II., p. 368) in which a gentleman at Leicester\n\f370 F. W. H. Myers.\ndiscerned an accident then occurring in the Thames Tunnel. Mr.\nWack's narrative recalls also Mrs. Storie's experience, (Phantasnu\nof the Living, Vol. I., p. 370), except that the person whose fate was\nrepresented in the dream was in this case entirely unknown to the\ndreamer. Mr. W. H. Wack is an attorney.\nP. 224. Court House, St. Paul, Minn.\nFebruary 10th, 1892.\nI believe I have had a remarkable experience. About midnight on the\n29th day of December, headsore and fatigued, I left my study where I had\nbeen poring over uninspiring law text, and, climbing to my chamber door,\nfell into bed for the night.\nNothing unusual had transpired in my affairs that day, and yet, when I\ngave myself to rest, my brain buzzed on with a myriad fancies. I lay an\nhour, awake, and blinking like an over-fed owl. The weird intonation of an\nold kitchen clock fell upon my ears but faintly, as it donged the hour of two.\nThe sound of the clock chime had hardly died when I became conscious of\nmy position in a passenger coach on the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha\nrailroad. I was journeying to Duluth, Minnesota, from St. Paul, in which\nlatter place I had gone to sleep. I was aware that I had been on the train\nabout four hours and that I was somewhere near the town of Shell Lake,\nWis., distant from St. Paul about eighty miles. I had often been over the\nroad, and as I peered through the coach window, I recognised, in the moonlit\nscene, features of country and habitation I had seen before. We were\nplunging on, almost heedlessly as it seemed, when I fancied I heard and\nwas startled from my reverie by a piercing shriek, which was protracted\ninto a piteous moaning and gasping, as if some human creature were suffering\nsome hideous torture.\nThen I felt the train grind heavily to an awkward stop. There was a\nsudden commotion fore and aft. Train men with lanterns hurried through\nmy car and joined employes near the engine. I could see the lights flash\nhero and there, beside and beneath the cars ; brakemen moved along the\nwheels in groups, the pipe voice of the conductor and tho awe-stricken cry\nof the black porter infused a livening sense to a scene which I did not\nreadily understand. Instinctively I concluded that an accident had happened,\nor perhaps that a break to the train had occasioned this sudden uprising of\ntrain men. A minute later I was out upon the road bed. The brusque and\nbusy search and the disturbed manner of the attendants did not invite\nelaborate inquiry from a curious passenger, so I was content to be told, in\nvery ugly snappish English, that if I had eyes I might see for myself that\n\" some one got killed, I reckon,\" Everybody moved and acted in a spirit of\nstealth, and each, it appeared, expected a horrible \" find.\" The trucks were\nbeing examined from the roar of the train forward. Blood splotches were\ndiscovered on nearly all the bearings under the entire train. When the gang\nreached one of the forward cars, all lights were cast upon a truck which was\nliterally scrambled with what appeared to be brains\u2014human brains,\nevidently, for among the clots were small tufts of human hair. This truck,\nparticularly, must have ground over the bulk of a human body. Every\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 371\nfixture between the wheels was smeared with the crimson ooze of some\ncrushed victim. But where was the body, or at least its members ? The\ntrucks were covered only with a pulp of mangled remnants. The search for\nwhat appeared of the killed was extended 500 yards back of the train and all\nabout the right-of-way with no more satisfactory result than to occasionally\nfind a blood-stained tie.\nAll hands boarded the train ; many declaring that it was an unusual\nmishap on a railroad which left such uncertain trace of its victim. Again\nI felt the train thundering on through the burnt pino wastes of northern\nMinnesota. As I reclined there in my berth, I reflected upon the experience\nof the night, and often befuddled my sleepy head in an effort to understand\nhow a train, pushing along at the rate of thirty miles an hour, could so\ngrind and triturate a vital bulk, staiuing only trucks behind the engine,\nunless the killed at the fatal time were upon the truck or huddled closely by\nit. I concluded, therefore, that the being destroyed under the train had\nbeen concealed near the bespattered fixtures of the car. I had read of\ndeath to tramps stealing rides by hiding themselves under or between cars,\nand finally I dismissed meditation\u2014assured that another unfortunate\nitinerant had been crushed out of existence. Horrible ! I shuddered and\nawoke\u2014relieved to comprehend it all a dream.\nNow the fact that the foregoing is an accurate statement of a dream\nexperienced by me is not a matter for marvel. Taken alone, there is nothing\nremarkable in the time at which this vision blackened my sleep. The spell\nwas upon me between two and three o'clock in the morning\u2014of that I am\ncertain. I am positive of the time, because, when I awoke, I heard the\nclock distinctly, as it struck three.\nOn the morrow, I,\u2014who usually forget an ordinary dream long before\nbreakfast\u2014recounted to the family the details of the night's distraction.\nFrom my hearers there followed only the ordinary comments of how ghastly\nand how shocking the story was as told and how strange the nature of the\naccident\u2014that no parts of the body had been found. The latter circumstance\nwas, to me also, quite an unusual feature of railroad casualty.\nThe evening following the night of tho dream (December 30th), at 5\no'clock, I returned to my home, stepped into my study, and, as I am in the\nhabit of doing, I glanced at a page of the St. Paid Dixpatch, a daily evening\nnewspaper. It had been casually folded by a previous reader, so that in\npicking it up flatly, the article which firsc fixed my attention read :\n\" Fite of a Tramf. Horrible Death Experienced by: an Unknown\nMan on the Omaha Road.\n\"Duluth, December 30.\u2014Every truck on the incoming Omaha train from\nSt. Paul this morning was splashed with blood. Trainmen did not know\nthere had been an accident till they arrived here, but think some unfortunate\nman must have been stealing a ride between St. Paul and this city. Train\nmen on a later train state that a man's leg was found by them at Spooner,\nand that for two miles this side the tracks were scattered with pieces of flesh\nand bone. There is no possible means of identification.\"\nHere was an evident verification of all that transpired in my mind between\ntwo and three o'clock on the previous night. I reflected, and the more I\n\f372 F. W. H. Myers.\npondered the faster I became convinced that I had been in some mysterious\nform, spirit or element, witness of the tragedy reported in the columns of\nthe press\u2014 that my vision was perfect as to general details, and the\nimpression complete and exact to time, place, and circumstance. The next\nmorning I scanned the pages of the Pioneer Press of December 31at, and\nread the following paragraph :\u2014\n\" Unknown man killed. Shell Lake, Wis. Special telegram,\nDecember 30th.\u2014Fragments of the body of an unknown man were picked\nup on the railroad track to-day. Portions of the same body were also found\non over 100 miles of the railroad. He is supposed to have been killed by\nthe night train, but just where is not known.\"\nWith this came the conviction to me that, living and asleep, 100 miles\nfrom the place of the killing, I had been subjected to the phantom-sight of\nan actual occurrence on the Omaha railroad, as vivid and in truth as I have\nstated it above.\nI have not written this account because Mark Twain and other authors\nhave published in current magazines their experiences in what is termed\nMental Telepathy or Mental Telegraphy. On the contrary, having read\na number of those articles, I have hesitated to utter, as authentic, what I\nnow believe to be a material and striking evidence of the extent, the caprice,\nand the possibilities of this occult phenomenon. Hirry W Wack\nIn reply to Dr. Hodgson's enquiries, Mr. Wack wrote :\u2014\nSt. Paul, February 20th, 1892.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014Replying to your valued favour of the 15th inst., I will\nsay that you are right in understanding that my account of the dream sub\nmitted to your Society is a true narrative.\nI reaffirm every word of it, and give you my solemn assurance that, as I\nhave stated, I informed my family and friends of the dream and its details,\nbefore I had the first suspicion that the public press ever had contained or\never would contain a report of such an actual occurrence.\nIf desirable I will make affidavit as to the truth of the substance of the\nnarrative in your hands.\nI enclose a few corroborative letters, the signatures to which I procured\nyesterday, February 19th.

On that occasion Mr. Wack stated that he had been agitated the pre\nvious night by a dream of unusual features, and then, at the request of those\npresent, he recited what now appears in his article, which I have just perused\nfor the first time. On the evening of December 30th, 1891, when Mr. Wack\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 373\ndiscovered the newspaper item, he again mentioned the dream and called my\nattention to the newspaper item, and several of the family discussed the\nmatter. On the morning of December 31st, another newspaper clipping\nbearing on the same matter was debated by the family.\nAside from the unusual features and hideousness of the dream, there was\nnothing to startle us, until the newspaper accounts developed the affair in u\nmysterious sense. The first version of the dream was given in the morning\nof December 30th. The first newspaper dispatch appeared and was dis\ncovered in the evening of the same day.

I have read the\naccount of the dream, and I believe it to be precisely as I understood it from\nMr. Wack's account given on the morning of December 30th, 1891.\nRose B.

It\nfas these newspaper dispatches which made the dream interesting, and there-\nafter it was freely discussed. c \u00a3 McDona1I1.\nMr. H. W.

He is\nquite clear that he had no opportunity to tell anyone beforehand, that the\nimage of the broken statue had actually come into his mind at the moment\nwhen he was brushing his hair, and the violent shock which he seems to\nhave felt when he saw his dream realised is strong evidence that he is not\nmistaken on this point.\nFrom Mr. J. Hunter Watts, of 39, Seething Lane, E.C.,\nJuly 16th, 1889.\nI will endeavour to commit to paper the little episode which I related to\nyou verbally. About six years ago I was with my brother George in Paris,\nwhere he bought for some eight or ten francs a Plaster of Paris \" Venus de\nMilo \"\u2014a ghastly copy of the original. I protested against the purchase as\nI had to share the bother of bringing the thing home, and as it was some\nfour or five feet high our fellow travellers imagined we had with us a corpse '\nrolled up in paper. Arrived home I would not consent to the house being\ndisfigured with the thing, so as a compromise my brother planted it on the\nsummit of a fern rockery in the corner of the garden, where it stood for\nmany months, and I had forgotten its existence save when it was directly in\nsight. Out of sight it was out of mind. One autumn morning, just after I\nhad risen from bed, I was combing my ambrosial locks before the looking-\nglass, and I caught myself reflecting that after all it was a pity the thing had\nblown down and broken, for it did not look so bad at a distance surrounded\nby the ferns. \" Strange too,\" I thought to myself, \" that the head should\nbe so neatly decapitated, though the fall made no other fracture.\" Then I\npulled myself up mentally, for all at once it came to my mind that I had\nbeen dreaming, and I smiled to myself that such a trumpery thing should be\nthe subject of my dreams. The whole matter would have been forgotten,\nwould have gone to the limbo of things unremembered, but on going down\nstairs to breakfast and finding the table not yet furnished, I went for a stroll\ninto the garden. It was wet underfoot and a strong wind was blowing.\nWhen I game to the fernery I gave a start and for a moment I stood tout\nebuhi, for there was the poor Venus de Milo, the body unbroken, lying across\nthe ferns, and the head, neatly decapitated, in the middle of the walk,\nexactly as I had seen it in my dream. For the moment T was convinced that\nI had been walking in my sleep and had visited the garden, but that I\nfound could not be the case, as it had rained all night and my garments\nwould have been wet through, and my feet, if unshod, muddy, or their\ncovering, if they had any, defiled, which was not the case. Neither am I\ngiven to walking in my sleep. I have never done so. I walked back to the\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 375\nhouse feeling, to use a vulgar phrase, \"knocked all silly.\" Can it be, I\nasked myself, and I have asked myself the same question a score of times\nsince, that while my body material slumbered in bed, some immaterial part\nof my being wandered in the garden ? If so, that immaterial part of me had\na remarkable disregard for wind and rain.\nThe episode is a trifling one, but it has often given me pause and it\nremains to me inexplicable. As you know I am a Bank Holiday sort of\nyoung man, not given to day-dreams. J HuSter Watts.\nIn answer to the inquiry whether the statue could have been seen from\nhis bedroom window, or from any other window in the house, Mr. Hunter\nWatts says :\u2014\" No, impossible ; only by stretching the head out of window\nanother side of house\u2014from rooms occupied by ladies.\"\nA lady to whom Mr. Watts related the dream corroborates as follows :\u2014\n45, Hungerford Road, Camden Road, N., Augitst 9th.\nAll I can at all remember about the Venus is that Mr. Watts told us one\nmorning that a strange thing had happened, he having dreamt that the\nstatue had been decapitated, and on going into the garden he found it was\nso, and that the head of the Venus had been cut clean off, and had rolled on\nto the path from the figure, which had been placed in the rockery among\nthe ferns. He was very much astonished, as the dream was vivid, and ho\nsaw the headless statue as he had seen it in his dream. We could never\nexplain how it happened, the head being, as it were, cut off.\nM. Adams.\nAgain this quasi-instinctive knowledge, realised on awaking from\nsleep, of the mutilation of a secluded statue may be compared with\ncases where a seer becomes aware of the position of a dead body,\u2014\nsometimes of no special interest to himself.\nP. 226.\nThe following case was borrowed originally from the Rd'njio-Philosophical\nJournal and quoted in Light, February 7th, 1891.\nA prominent Chicago journalist states that his wife asked him one\nmorning while still engaged in dressing, and before either of them had left\ntheir sleeping room, if he knew any one named Edsale or Esdale. A negative\nreply was given, and then a \" Why do you ask ? \" She replied : \" During the\nnight Idreamed that I was on the lake shore, and found a coffin there with\nthe name of Edsale or Esdale on it, and I am confident that some one of that\nname has recently been drowned there.\" On opening the morning paper,\nthe first item that attracted his attention was the report of the mysterious\ndisappearance from his home in Hyde Park of a young man named Esdale.\nA few days afterwards the body of a young man was found on the lake shore.\nThis case, with further matter, was sent to Dr. Hodgson by an\ninformant, to whom Dr. Hodgson replied as follows :\u2014\nBoston, Mass., October 22nd, 1888.\nThe first two substantial paragraphs appear to be a statement quoted\nfrom the Chicago Times. You do not say whether you have any personal\n\f37C F. W. H. Myers.\nknowledge of the gentleman in question ; whether he personally confirms\nthe account ; whether you have the statement of his wife, over her\nsignature, confirming the details so far as she was concerned ; what the\ndate of the experience was, and what the date of the first written account\nof it was ; whether any memorandum of the circumstance was made on\nthe day itself ; whether you have the independent confirmation of the\nfinding of the body of Esdaile ; whether it was possible that some account\nof the young man's disappearance may have appeared in an evening paper of\nthe day before, rendering it possible for [your informant's] wife to have read\nthe account, or seen some heading referring to it, and afterwards forgotten\nit ; and I venture to suggest that if you have not worked up the case in this\nway, it should be so worked up.\nI am desirous, of course, that whoever is engaged in collecting such cases\nshould present as much corroboration as possible for each.\nRichard Hodosox.\nOn this the then Editor of the Reluiio-Philosophical Journal, the late\nColonel Bundy, remarks : \u2014\nI have known the gentleman and his wife mentioned in case No. 10, by\nreputation, for some fifteen years, and personally for six years. I obtained\nfrom each of them a report of the case when first published, October 14th.\n1885, and each said that the statement was true as published in the Chicago\nTimes of that date. I saw both of them September 23rd, [1888], just prior\nto publishing the report, and read it to them ; each declared it to be a true\nreport of the occurrence. After receipt of Mr. Hodgson's letter I called to -\nsee what further information they could furnish in regard to the other points\nmentioned therein. After reading the letter, the gentleman, who is Mr.\nFranc B. Wilkie, the well-known editorial writer, and \"Poliuto\" of the\nChicago Times, at once volunteered the following statement :\u2014\nChicago, October 26th, 1888.\nIn October, 1885, I was one of the editorial writers on the Chicago\nTimes, and wrote the item referred to. I am the individual mentioned\ntherein. The date of the occurrence was about a week prior to the date of\nthe report in the Times. I did not make any written memorandum on the\nday it occurred ; as the coincidence was so strong and distinctly marked, it\nmade such an indelible impression on my mind, I did not forget any of the\ndetails during the time prior to writing the item. The name was one\nunknown to me previous to seeing it in the Chicago Daily News the morning\nreferred to. I had not seen any reference to the disappearance before that\nmorning. My wife said at the time, and still says, that she had never seen\nthe name, or heard in any way of the disappearance. I was, of course,\non the look-out for any report of the return of the young man, or of the\nfinding of his body, and saw the account of the finding of the body in the\nChicago papers a few days after the appearance of the first item in regard to\nhis disappearance ; and then wrote the item for the Times of October 14th. I\nhad at the time carefully examined the case in all its bearings, and although\nI may not agree with the various explanations or theories that might be\noffered in regard to it, I gave it as a curious coincidence and one that I\nknew to be true.\nFranc B. AVilkie.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 377\nTo which Mrs. Wilkie adds the following :\u2014\nHaving read the foregoing statement, I wish to certify to its truth. The\ndream was the cause of considerable comment for tho few days following, as\nto the various features of the case, and whether the dream would be verified.\nMy previous presentiments had been with reference to intimate friends,\nwhich made this one appear the more marked, and caused Mr. Wilkio to\nexamine the matter more carefully in all its details.\nThe residence of the young man was eight miles from our home. I am not\nware that we have ever known any of the young man's friends, or anyone\nwho knew him ; and am certain that had the fact of his disappearance been\nmentioned in my hearing prior to the morning after the dream, I should\nhave remembered the name, for I distinctly remembered that it seemed\npeculiar to me, when I saw it in apparently large silver letters on the coffin.\nMrs. Fbanc B. Wilkie.\nThe Chicago Daily News of the morning of Wednesday, October 7th,\n1835, was an eight column paper, and at the top of the seventh column\nappeared the following :\u2014\nW. E. Esdaile, in the employ of Robert Warren and Co., commission\nmerchants in the Royal Insurance-building, and residing at 4,523, Woodlawn-\navenue, Kenwood, has been missing since last Friday morning. Mr.\nEsdaile is a Canadian, unmarried, and twenty-seven years of age. His\nfamily resides at Montreal. He has been resting from business during the\nlast week, and has spent much of his time strolling along the lake shore.\nAs his accounts are all right, and there is no assignable reason for his dis\nappearance, his friends fear that he has committed suicide. Overwork, it is\nthought, and an injury to his skull, received some years ago, may possibly\nhave brought on insanity. The police are searching for him.\nThe records in the Coroner's office for Cook County, 111., show that\ninquest No. 941 was held on October 10th, 1885, on the body of Wm. E.\nEsdaile, drowned October 2nd, in Lake Michigan, whether by accident or\notherwise the jury were unable to determine.\nMr. Robert Warren, of the above-named firm of Robert Warren and Co.,\nsays that he landed in New York on his return from a trip to England, on\nMonday, October 5th, 1885, and reached Chicago,Wednesday, p.m., October\n7th ; that he did not hear of the disappearance of Mr. Esdaile until he\nreached home, and knows of no public announcement of the disappearance\nprior to that in the News of October 7th ; that, had there been any, ho\nwould very likely have heard of it between New York and Chicago, as he was\non the look-out for news from Chicago.\nMr. Ward, who had charge of Mr. Warren's business during his absence,\nsays that he was informed of Mr. Esdaile's disappearance on Friday evening,\nOctober 2nd. On Saturday, a.m., he examined tho papers, etc., found in\nthe young man's room ; found no evidence of suicidal intent, but indications\nthat he was not in his right mind, and concluding that he might have\nwandered off, a detective was employed to search for him. The matter was\nkept very quiet, so as to prevent publication of sensational reports that\nwould alarm his friends, and also render it unpleasant for the young man\nshould he be found. Mr. Ward is not aware that any announcement of the\n1\n\f378 F. W. H. Myers.\nmatter was made in any papers, before the item in the News of October 7th.\nThey were following on the track of a young man, whose description corres\nponded somewhat with that of Mr. Esdaile, who had been seen at the\nwaterworks of Hyde Park (and Kenwood), and then had travelled around the\nend of Lake Michigan into Indiana, and were expecting to find him very\nsoon, when on Saturday morning, October 10th, notice was received that the\nbody of Esdaile had been found on the lake shore near his home.\nIn referring to the matter,the Chicago Tribune of Saturday, October 10th,\n1885, says : \"It will be seen that the detectives are on a warm trail and will\nprobably overtake the young man, who is believed to be insanely wandering\nabout without aim or purpose.\" [There was thus no general belief that lie\nhad been drmmted.]\nA Chicago reporter, who resides at Kenwood, and was acquainted with\nEsdaile, says that he first heard of the disappearance through the school\nchildren, who said that the teacher had told them that Mr. Esdaile was miss\ning, and requested them to tell their parents, and ask if any one had seen\nhim. The reporter, knowing Mr. Ward, called on him to obtain the parti\nculars for publication, but Mr. Ward objected, saying that Mr. Warren had\nbeen away for some time ; that Mr. Esdaile had been practically in charge\nof the affairs of the firm ; that Mr. Warren had just landed in New York,\nand a public announcement of the matter in the papers would cause him\nunnecessary alarm. The reporter says that the item in the papers, Wednes\nday, October 7th, was the first public announcement of the matter.\nThe next case is somewhat similar ; but the precise time-relation\nbetween incident and vision is not clear. It is evidentially a weak\npoint that the vision was not mentioned before the incident was\nknown.\nM.C1. 90.\nThe following account was written in the early part of 1892. The writer\nis a retired professional man.\nWednesday, November 18th [1891], I was lying on a sofa about 2 p.m.\nin half doze, when my thoughts reverted to Southsea, where I had spent\nabout a fortnight in June last. A mental picture, realistic enough almost for\na dream, of the animation and stir of the pier and steamboats'interested me,\nwhen all at once my mind became absorbed with the conception of a\nbarge-like vessel with diving apparatus engaged in some submarine work. The\nimpression of something being wrong, with a hurried agitated effort to raise\na diver from the water, impressed me. There seemed to be a difficulty in\nworking the winding-up machine, and in my dream, or semi-dream, I was\nexcited with the fear that they would fail to get the diver up alive through\nthe apparent hitch. At last in my reverie, they succeeded in raising him,\nand then, as if I were in the barge, I seemed to 6ee the helmet removed, and\nthe diver was dead. I thought no more of the matter except as a rather\npeculiar instance of a half-awake dream. But the next day when reading the\nDaily News, I was startled on coming across a paragraph stating in effect\nthat \"yesterday morning\" (the day of my mental impression, dream, or call\nit what you will), whilst a diving party were engaged in doing something to\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 379\nsome chain moorings in Portsmouth Harbour, the diver got probably in some\nray entangled, and signalled to be token up. The effort was at once made to\ndo so, but considerable delay was occasioned by the supposed obstacle, and\nwhen at last he was brought to the surface he was quite dead, black in the\nface, and blood oozing from his mouth and nostrils. Struck with the at least\nremarkable coincidence, I read the paragraph to my wife and a lady who was\npresent, as answering so precisely in every particular to my mental impression\nof the previous day, which could not have been more than three or four hours\nat the earliest from the time the accident actually occurred.\nThe lady through whom the case was received writes :\u2014\nMay 16r\/i, 1892.\nI called upon Mr. , and he said that he had not mentioned his dream\n(nr vision) to any one until some hours afterwards, when the newspaper\ncame in. A Miss , an elderly lady who was present when I called, said\nthat she was also there when the newspaper came in, and remembered his\nexclamation of surprise and his saying, \" Why, this is the very thing I\ndreamed of yesterday,\" or some words of that sort.\nThe following is the account of the incident given in the Daily N&ies of\nThursday, Nov. 19th, 1891 :\u2014\nDeath of a Diver on Duty. \u2014Yesterday morning a party of men were\nengaged in repairing the moorings of the Corporation Buoy in Portsmouth\nHarbour, which had been damaged during the recent gale. A diver named\nLuke went down, but he had been below only four or five minutes, when he\ngave the customary signal for being hauled up, having apparently become\nentangled. Some difficulty was experienced in getting him above water, but\nthis having been accomplished and the helmet removed, he was found to be\nblack in the face and bleeding from the nose. As soon as possible he was\nconveyed to the Harbour Railway Station, where he was found to be dead.\nIt is sometimes claimed that a specially gifted seer is able to\ndiscover missing corpses by some effort of clairvoyance,1 or perhaps, as\nclaimed in the first of the following cases, by intimation from some\nspirit interested in the deceased.\nP. 257. Through Rev. M. J. Savage.\nDear Mr. Savage,\u2014My mother has written out for you, at my request,\nthe particulars of the drowning of the Mason boys. She has told the story\nin her own way. She has suggested copying it, but at her age, seventy-\nfive, I think it is too much of a task for her. All the parties she refers to,\nexcepting Mrs. Brigham, who was the one she wished to take her place in\ngoing to Boston, are now living, and on my return from Washington I will\ngo to N. and get the evidence of the mother, brother, and Mr. Clark.\nI do not remember the particulars as does my mother. A sister of the\nboys was a schoolmate of mine. I knew at the time that the boys were\nmissing. I knew from the sister the particulars of the case as it went on.\n1 See a case communicated by Dr. Wiltse, Vol. VII., p. 77.\n\f380 F. W. H. Myers.\nI went to the lake on the Monday morning my mother speaks about, to\nsoe the cannon fired. It was\u2014the firing of a cannon\u2014an unusual event to\nus children. The town was so small we knew everything that was occurr\ning. I was at the lake when the grappling irons were used in the afternoon,\nand remember to have heard the men say it was no use to drag the lake\nfurther, as the boys certainly were not in it, notwithstanding the mother\nfelt so decided that they were there. I was in the crowd that met my\nmother at the station, and heard what she said, and went with the rest to\nthe lake, and stood and listened to the laughs and jokes of those about me\nat what was going on.\nIt is just as she said. A silence that was terrible fell over us all, as, in\nless than five minutes, both boys were lying dead on the shore before us\nall.\u2014Very truly yours,\nEleanor F. Crosby.\nMarch 23rd, 1891.\nIn March, 1864, I was living in N., about 17 miles from Boston. I had\na neighbour who had, among other children, two sons, the eldest about 15,\nthe younger brother 11. Their names were Willie and Joshua Mason.\nThe older brother, Willie, was employed in the store of Weeks and Potter,\ndruggists, on Washington-street, Boston. This Willie Mason had come to\nN. on Friday at two o'clock, to spend Sunday with his mother, Mrs. Joseph\nCritcherson. (The boys' father was dead, and the mother had married\nagain.) The mother had gone to Boston the same day Willie Mason had\ncome out to make the visit. It had been her intention to come out on the\nsame train with her son, but he had come out earlier than he had expected.\nHe reached N. about two o'clock, and went immediately to his home. He\nsaid to his younger brother, not finding his mother at home and not meeting\nher at the station, \" Let us go to meet mother.\"\nThese are the last words he is known by anyone living to have spoken,\nand this was his intention as he left the house in company with his brother\nto the depot. Mrs. Critcherson did not come on this train from Boston,\nbut on the one following ; her boys did not meet her, neither did she find\nthem at home when she reached there. This was late Friday afternoon.\nThey did not return that night, but all day Saturday, as nothing was heard\nfrom them, she became almost frantic with grief. She said her boys would\nnever keep away from her and give all this trouble if they were where\nthey could come to her. Her husband, the stepfather to the boys, was in\nthe army, and was then in Washington. On Saturday, friends of the family\nsent to Boston to see if they had gone there. They interviewed the train\nconductors to learn if any such boys had been seen going in any direction.\nAll the mother knew of the boys was what the sister of the boys had told\nher on her return, that Willie had left the house saying he was going to\nmeet his mother.\nMrs. Critcherson, so far as I know, was not acquainted in any way with\nSpiritualism, and she afterwards became a member of the orthodox church\nin N. She had all the time, while gentlemen were visiting camps and\ntelegraphing in different directions, a very strong impression that her boys\nwere in the lake, and did not come to her because they could not. No one\nin town believed this to be possible. In the first place, they were not\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 381\nseen by anyone on the lake. Then, in March, there was nothing to attract\nboys to the lake. But, to quiet the anxiety of the mother, some of the\ngentlemen of the town had agreed to take cannons to the lake, and fire them\nfrom a point near the boat-house on Monday morning, as it was known that\nbodies having been long in the water could be raised by this procedure.\nFor, granting that the mother's impressions were correct, which no one else\nbelieved, the boys had been from Friday afternoon till Monday morn in the\nwater. A Mr. Andrew Clark, who had a livery stable inN., agreed to go\nto Boston Monday morning to get grappling irons to drag the lake more\nthoroughly. I had not been to see Mrs. Critcherson till I went about nine\no'clock on Monday morning. I knew she had many in and out continually,\nand, believing the boys would come back before long, I was not uneasy about\nthem. I suppose why I believed they would return was because I could not\nthink of them as going to the lake at this season of the year ; and then I had\nnot seen her, to be influenced by her feelings, and shared the general\nfeeling of the town that, while the boys were known to every one to be\nunusually fine boys, still this must be a frolic which would have an ending\nsoon.\nAs I said before, I went to Mrs. Critcherson's about nine o'clock on\nMonday morning to offer her my services, because I had by this time begun\nto feel uneasy myself, while I still believed they were alive somewhere. I\nfound Mrs. Critcherson very much unnerved, and saying, \" Only one thing\nremained to be done, and that was for some one to go to Boston and\nconsult a clairvoyant,\" and turning to me, she said, \" Mrs. D., you are the\none I want to go.\" I had never visited a clairvoyant or consulted one, and\ndid not know where to go or how to turn. I said to her, \" I am not the person\nto go,\" and turning to another friend I said, \"Now she is just the person to\ngo.\" I had offered my services, but I did not wish to go on such an errand\nand an undertaking I was not familiar with. She turned to me again, and\nsaid, \"1 wish you to go for me.\" I said that I would go home and get\nready at once, to go on the 11 o'clock train. I must say here, I had no\nfaith that anything would come from this visit to Boston. By the time 1\nreached the station, at 11 o'clock, it was pretty generally known in N.\nthat I was going to Boston to consult, as a last resource, with a clairvoyant,\nas they had already fired the cannons with no result, and were sure now that\nthe boys were by no possibility in the lake. On the same train going in, was\nthis Andrew Clark going after the grappling irons. He said to some of the\ntownspeople at the station that he would return as soon as possible. He\ndid arrive in N. on the two o'clock train, and went with a large number of\npersons to the lake, but after using the irons for some time, they all gave\nup and went to the town again, saying, \"It is of no use ; the boys we\ncannot find.\" The mother still felt sure they were in the lake, until they\nwere found Monday eve.\nI arrived in Boston at 12 o'clock. I went, as I had been told to do, to\nthe Banner of Light office, and asked there, as a stranger, if they could\ndirect me to some reliable clairvoyant. They directed me to some one on\nor near Court-street. I found the woman engaged. The gentleman who\nanswered the bell-pull directed me to a clairvoyant on Dix-place. When\nI arrived at Dix-place I found this woman also engaged, but she directed me\n2 p\n\f382 F. W. H. Myers.\nto a Mrs. York, on Washington-street, near Common-street. It was about\nthree o'clock. A sitter was leaving as I rang the bell. Mrs. York opened\nthe door herself. When I told her my errand, she told me she could not see\nme till the next day, but on my saying the next day would be too late, she\ntold me to walk into her parlour, and she would go out and take a walk\nand on her return would see me. These were the only words she addressed\nto me, and I am sure she knew nothing of me whatever, where I came from,\nor what my errand was about. I spoke no words with her further than\nthose I have already stated, neither had I ever heard of Mrs. York before,\nand she knew no one in N. She was gone about 15 minutes, when she came\ninto the room, and going to the fireplace at once, and with her back to me,\nand without my speaking one word, she said, \"They went East before they\nwent West.\" (The railroad station is east from the house in which their mother\nlived, and the lake west.) She then said, \" They saw the fire, and so went\nto the water.\" (It was afterwards found out that on this day, Friday\nafternoon, some men were burning brush near the lake ; that was what\nattracted them up there.) She then went on to describe the boat-house,\nwith a hole in the side of the boat-house. She then said, \" They went in\nthrough this hole in the side.\" She described the boat, which she said was\na \" narrow boat, painted black,'' and said, \" Oh dear, it was never intended\nthat but one person should get into it at a time.\" She told of their pulling\nout a little way, the younger brother falling into the water first, and the\nolder brother trying to save him, and also said, \"The place where they are\nis muddy, and they could not come to the surface.\" \" Why,\" said she, \"it\nis not the main lake they are in, but the shallow point which connects the\nmain lake, and they are so near the shore, and if it was not this time of the\nyear (March) you could almost walk in and pick them up.\" She told of\nthe citizens' interest in trying to find them, and said, \" They will not find\nthem ; they go too far from the shore ; they are on the left of the boat-\nhouse, a few feet from the land.\" Then I said, \"If they are in the water,\nthey will be found before I can reach home.\" She said, \" No, they will not\nbe found before you get there ; you will have to go and tell them where they\nare, and then they will be found within five minutes after you reach the\nlake.\" She made me promise to go with them to the lake. She said, \"They\nare very near together ; after finding one you will quickly find the other.\"\nIt was not more than ten minutes before the boys were found and on the\nway to their mother's house, after I told them. I reached Natick at five\no'clock. Thore was a crowd at the station. When I got out on to the\nplatform, some gentleman said to me, \"Mrs. D., what did the clairvoyant\ntell you?\" I answered, \"Haven't you found them yet?\" They said no,\nand then I told them what Mrs. York had said, and went with them to the\nlake. In looking into the boat-house it was found that the long narrow boat\nowned by Mr. Benning Hall, and painted, as she had said, all in black, was\nmissing ; this boat, as she had said, ' ' was to hold only one man, and was unsafe\noccupied by two persons.\" (I did not know at the time of my sitting with\nMrs. York that Mr. Benning Hall was the owner of such a boat, or that the\nboat-house was used to shelter a boat of this description. I had never seen\nsuch a boat owned by any one ; so this part she did not reach from my mind.)\nAnd this boat was found in a cove some distance from the boat-house, a few\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 383\ndays after. Neither did I know of the \"hole\" in the boat-house until I\nreached the lake on this afternoon. Finding that what she said of the boat\naud the hole in the boat-house was true, I began to think the rest might be\ntrue also ; but no one in the crowd, so far as I know, did place any\nconfidence in her statement. I stood on the shore and two boats put off\nwith men holding grappling irons. I was able to tell them how to direct\ntheir course. Three or four strokes of the oars and the elder brother of the\nboys who were missing, and who was holding one of the grappling irons,\nexclaimed, \"I have hold of something.\" The men stopped rowing, and he\nraised the body of the largest boy above the water. In taking the body\ninto the boat, the boat moved a few lengths. They were told to go to the\nsame place where the eldest had been found, and almost immediately brought\nup the other body. It was not ten minutes after reaching the lake that the\nboys were found, and were being taken to their home. As Mrs. York had\nsaid, they were in a muddy place ; their clothing testified to the fact.\nThe disappearance of the boys in the manner I have described is known\nby fifty persons now living in Natick. I cannot say how much larger the\nnumber is.\nShe had while in this trance, by using books on the table, showed me the\nboat-house and the shore so well, that any one from the description could\nhave gone directly to the water and found them.\nI asked her how she came by this information. She answered, \"The\nboys' father told me.\" How did she know the boys' father had been dead\nseveral years ? Elizareth Everett Davis.\nBoston, May Uth, 1891, 2.38 p.m.\nI met Mrs. Davis within the last hour, on the street. Her daughter,\nMrs. Crosby, was driving her to the station. She is going to see her sister\nin Natick.\nShe told me that the medium, Mrs. York, told her that it was Mr.\nMason's spirit\u2014the father of the two boys\u2014who told her where the bodies\nof the boys could be found in the lake. T \u201e\n' M. J. Savage.\nNatick, May 5th, 1891.\nI am the sister of Mrs. Elizabeth E. Davis, and lived in Natick at the\ntime of the disappearance of the Mason boys. I remember the fact that my\neister went to Boston to consult a clairvoyant by request. The name of the\nclairvoyant was Mrs. York. Mrs. York was a perfect stranger to my sister,\nshe never having heard of her before she left Natick for Boston. I heard\nher relate all the particulars at the time, which are found in her statement.\n1 have heard her relate it many times since without any variations. I\nremember that when my sister went to consult the clairvoyant she had no\nconfidence that she would receive any information that would be of use in\nfinding the boys, or that after Mrs. York's directions they would prove true.\nShe even hesitated to relate what Mrs. York had told, but, being met by a\nlarge delegation at the station, she felt that she must, it being demanded\nwhat she had been told, Mrs. York having made her promise that she would\ndo so, and charged her to bo sure and be explicit. I know my sister did not\n2 f 2\n\f384 F. W. H. Myers.\nbelieve they were in the pond. She thought, like most others, that they had\ngone out of town, perhaps visiting encampments. The medium used books\nto indicate and illustrate by existing objects unknown to Mrs. Davis, the\nterminus of the two directions, and said, \"Where these lines cross, there you\nwill find the boys.\" Everything had been done that could be to find them\nwhen the train arrived at Natick at five o'clock. Mrs. York charged her to\nreturn as soon as possible, as the boys would not be found until she (Mrs.\nDavis) had given the directions. At the Natick railroad station she told her\nstory but the men insisted that she should go with them to the lake, which\nshe did directly. They followed Mrs. Davis's directions and in a few\nmoments she said, \"There is the place.\" One of the boys was immediately\npulled to the surface, and in a few moments the other. Mrs. York stated to\nMrs. Davis how the drowning happened , to the effect that the younger fell\nout of the boat first and that the older boy in trying to help him was also\ndrowned. There were many there who witnessed the recovery of the bodies,\nand 'twas a very impressive moment, and is considered one of the most, and\nperhaps the most remarkable occurrence ever happening in Natick.\nThis is a bare statement of facts which can be attested by many persons.\nCatherine S.

Mason, who were drowned\nin Lake Cochituate, Natick, Massachusetts, on Friday afternoon, March\n25th, 1864, aged sixteen and thirteen.\nMarch 25th I was out of town till evening. During my absence my son\nWilliam arrived from Portland, Maine, where he had been temporarily\nemployed by H. H. Hay, wholesale druggist, during the rebuilding of the\nstore of his former employers, which had been destroyed by fire. This\nfirm's name was Weeks and Potter, Washington-street, Boston, and he had\njust been recalled to them and was to begin work with them again in their\nnew store the following Monday.\nOn reaching his home, he found me absent and left home with the\nintention of meeting me at the depot at five o'clock, accompanied by his\nbrother Joshua.\nI came two hours later and I was met by a little friend of theirs who told\nme that Willie had got home. On my reaching home I enquired where\nhe was, and was told that he and Joshua had gone out to meet me on the five\no'clock train, since which time they had not seen either of them. From the\nmoment when they said they had not seen them, I wondered where they were,\nbut consoled myself with the thought that they might be calling on some of\ntheir associates who were perhaps pleasantly entertaining them, which caused\ntheir delay.* When bed-time came and they did not return, I became very\nanxious, and had a sleepless night.\nAt this time my husband, their step-father, was in the army and\nconsequently could not help me. The next morning an elder son began\nwith me to make enquiries. We rode to every point where we hoped\ninformation concerning them might be given. To our sorrow no information\nrelating to their whereabouts could be obtained.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 385\nSaturday, at about five o'clock, we returned and reported to our\nneighbours, who had become very much interested on account of their\ndisappearance, that we could learn nothing from them. They offered their\nservices, and at my suggestion immediately instituted a search, going to\ndifferent towns, each individual acting on his own ideas as to where they\nmight be found, as I could give no suggestions. Every ono returned failing\nto have obtained any information.\nThey then came to me to ask what further I wouM wish them to do. My\nreply was that were my husband at home, I could say just what I would have\ndone, and I said that would be to have the lake searched for them, for I felt\nthey were where they could not reach me, and must be in the pond, or they\ncertainly would be at home. No one believed they could by any means be\nin the pond, but this was my own strong impression. To gratify me they\ncommenced their search in the pond immediately on Sunday evening.\nDuring this evening a boat was discovered floating on the opposite shore.\nMy brother came to me at about midnight on Sunday and said, \"I am\nafraid your apprehensions are correct, for we have found a boat afloat.\"\nThey suspended further operations till morning because of the darkness.\nOn Monday morning early the engine bells and church bells were rung to\ncall the citizens together to organise so as to systematically search the pond.\nNearly all business was suspended. They fired a cannon and used\ngrappling irons and spent all the morning in the effort to find my boys.\nThey came, some friends, every half-hour, to report to me the result of their\nsearch, and to relieve my anxiety all they could.\nMrs. Davis called at about ten o'clock and wished to know if she could\naid me in any way. I proposed that she should go to Boston to consult with\na clairvoyant, for I felt this was my last resort, though at the time I knew\nnothing of clairvoyance and had no belief in it, but I wanted to try every\nthing. I knew personally of no clairvoyant and left it all with Mrs. Davis,\nthe result of which visit she has already given, and I corroborate it. I do\nnot think that Mrs. Davis had any faith that anything would come from her\ngoing to Boston, but she went only to gratify me. I did not say to her\nanything about a boat having been seen afloat the night before.\nAll search for my boys was given up at about three o'clock. Every one\nfelt sure by this time that they could not be in the water, and despaired of\nfinding them and waited to see what directions Mrs. Davis would bring from\nBoston, if any.\nShe reached Natick at five o'clock. Mrs. York, the clairvoyant, said that\nmy boys were in the pond, and she gave Mrs. Davis directions how to find\nthem and told when and where they would be found. They went\nimmediately to the pond. It was supposed by the townspeople that they\nhad dragged all the ground she described.\nMrs. Davis arrived in Natick at five o'clock, and at twenty minutes of\nsix my boys were brought into my house.\nMary A. Critcherson.\nWitness :\u2014 Caroline Brigham.\nNote.\u2014Caroline Brigham was post-mistress of Natick for several years,\nand was appointed to the position by Henry Wilson, or through his influence.\n\f.386 F. W. H. Myers.\nI have had read to me my mother's statement concerning the drowning of\nmy brothers, William and Joshua Mason, and I corroborate it with this\nexception. I think my mother is mistaken concerning the finding of the\nboat. To the best of my memory the boat she speaks of was seen for the\nfirst time on Monday forenoon after the citizens had organized, and not on\nSunday night.\nSunday I was not at home. I drove to Readville and visited the camps\nthere. I also visited the Charlestown navy yard. From Saturday morning\ntill Sunday night I was driving all the time in different directions, and other\nparties were going in further directions. My mother had all this time, after\nthey failed to reach home late Friday night, a very strong impression that\nthe boys were in the lake, and no one was able to change that feeling. We\ndid not make any attempt to search the lake till everything else had failed ;\nit was a difficult thing to do any efficient work there without the assistance\nof the townspeople, and no one could be made to feel they were by any\npossibility in the water. It was in war times and the townspeople thought\nthey had gone away to enlist as captains' boys or drummer boys, but my\nmother scouted the idea and would not listen to it for one minute.\nOn Monday morning the bells were rung, and the people congregated at\nthe engine house and there they organized. My mother located where she\nfelt sure the boys were, to the meadow part of the lake. We went in\ndetachments, surrounding the shore of that part of the lake. It was at this\ntime in the middle of the forenoon that this boat already named was found,\nupside down, on the opposite side of the lake to where the boat-house was.\nIt couldn't by any possibility have been seen at the boat-house. I had\nbefore this been up to the lake and walked, not all round the lake, but\nenough to satisfy me that there was no boat to be seen. They fired a cannon\nseveral times and moved the cannon to different points. We then went in\nboats with grappling irons such as we could procure. We worked till about\nthree o'clock. We went several times to within a few feet of where they\nwere afterwards found. It was known that Mrs. Davis had gone to Boston\nto consult with a clairvoyant. I had looked to find some hat or something\nelse to show that my brothers were drowned.\nI began on Sunday to feel with my mother that they were in the pond, as\nI could get no trace of them anywhere, though up to their being found I\ncould get no clue to lead me to suppose so. My mother had no reason to\nthink they were in the pond, further than the fact that she knew her boys so\nwell, especially William, who was the oldest, and knew they were such boys\nthey would never have kept away from her if they could have come to her.\nI knew they could not have gone into the water to swim at that season of\nthe year, and another reason why I was led to think my brothers had not\ngone to the water was because I knew they were afraid of the water.\nI went to the station to meet Mrs. Davis because we had become dis\ncouraged. There was also a very largo crowd there to meet her. She told\nme what Mrs. York had said, and gave me directions how to proceed, the\ncourse to pursue with the boat. She went to the lake. I got into the boat.\nI remember that a Mr. Langdon Spooner was with me in this boat. Mrs.\nYork said we must go a little north of west and not go so far from the\nshore. The water was so shallow where they were drowned, that I made the\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 387\nremark immediately after that if he, my brother William, had stood up\nstraight he would not have been drowned, his head would have been above\nwater. We followed Mrs. York's course nearer to the shore. I held the\ngrappling-iron and in this direct course Mrs. York had indicated I grappled\ninto the coat collar of my eldest brother a very short distance from\n\u2022hore. We brought the body to the land, and I did not go out again,\nbut remained by the side of the body already found. Mr. Langdon\nSpooner, with a grappling iron at the end of a long pole, found the body\nof my brother Joshua almost immediately after, as Mrs. York said it\ni would be found.\nI think it is well to state in this connexion, so that no confusion may\narise in the mind of any one reading this, that my mother has been married\nthree times. Her first husband, who was my father, was Albe 0. Hanscome.\nI have two sisters, both of whom are living. Her second husband, the father\nof the two boys who were drowned (and they were the only children by this\nmarriage), was Wm. P. Mason. Her third and present husband is Joseph\nCritcherson.\nCharles P. Hanscome.\nWitnesses to signature :\u2014\nEva C. Clement.\nNatick, May 5th, 1891. Eleaxor F.

In confirmation of the\nclairvoyance of Mrs. York I would say, about one year and a half after the\nfinding of my sons in a manner she described, Mrs. York came to my house\nunexpectedly. This was her first visit to the town of Natick, Mass. She\nsaid she had come to Natick wishing to visit the lake where the boys were\ndrowned. I accompanied her. When we had arrived within a short distance\nof the lake, she requested me to fall back, saying she would show me the\nplace where the bodies were found. I fell back. She went to the shore\nof the lake, going into what seemed to be a trance ; she picked up a stone\nand, with her back to the water, threw her arm over her head and the stone\nlanded where they told me the bodies were found, her eyes being closed at\nthe time.\nThis is to me a mystery. Jo8ePH CrrrCHekSON.\nWitnesses:- Mary A. Critcherson.\nArthur Waters.\nIn March, 1864, I had a livery stable in Natick in company with Mr.\nTyler Brooks. Mr. Critcherson and his family were acquaintances of mine.\nMr. Charles Sherman, Mr. Brooks and myself, after the boys were found to\nbe missing on Friday night, were more active than any one else in town,\noutside the family, in trying to discover the boys' whereabouts. Mr.\nSherman and Mr. Brooks are now both dead. Although it happened so\nmany years ago, I had so much to do with it I remember the particulars of\nour proceedings perfectly.\n\f388 F. W. H. Myers.\nWhen we began our work, none of us had the slightest idea as to where\ni he boys were. I took one of my teams on both Saturday and Sunday and\ndrove everywhere, where any one said it was possible they might be found.\nIn these two days I drove miles. My partner, Mr. Brooks, and also Mr.\nSherman did the same, but we none of us could get a clue to them.\nOn Monday morning I drove to Saxonville and got the cannon which was\nused for firing at the lake. After using this cannon I went to Boston on the\neleven o'clock train for irons to drag with ; before this we had used some on\nthe lake Monday morning that we had manufactured ourselves. I remember\nthat Mrs. Davis was on this same train, and that she was going to Boston to\nconsult with a clairvoyant. We both talked the matter over. Neither Mrs.\nDavis nor myself had any faith she would get any news of the boys in this\nway. I came out on the two o'clock train and went at once to the lake and\nwe used the irons, but with no result. We all got tired out and gave up and\nwent to the dep6t to hear what Mrs. Davis would say. I remember what she\ntold as being said by the clairvoyant. Mrs. Davis went to the lake, and the\nboys were found just where she said they would be found, as well as in the\nmanner she had described, and as reported to us by Mrs. Davis.\nOne of my teams was at the lake, a wagon like an express wagon, and\ntheir bodies were taken to their home in it. I don't explain how this was\ndone, the finding the boys. I only state the facts. We were about twenty\nminutes at the lake.\nAndrew I. Clarr.\nWitnesses :\u2014\nMrs. Charlotte A.

No one knew where the boys\nwere, and every effort to trace them had failed till after Mrs. Davis's return\nfrom Boston on Monday afternoon, when the boys were found where and as\nshe said they would be found, through the mediumship of a Mrs. York of\nBoston.\nI, G. A Colbath, was at the lake on Monday morning when the cannon\nwas fired. No one would have ever gone to the lake to look for the boys\nagain, had not Mrs. Davis returned from Boston, and told what the\nclairvoyant said. Some thought they might have gone to the lake, and\nothers (this was the general belief) thought they had run away to enlist.\nI, G. A. Colbath, was on my way to the post-office at night when an\nacquaintance met me and said, \"The boys are found, and a medium has told\nwhere they were.\" The reason why it was not believed that they could be\nin the lake was because, on the shore, nothing belonging to them could be\nfound. It is sure that the clairvoyant not only told where they were, but\nlocated the exact spot.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 389\nIt is our belief that the boys were found through the mediumship of\nMrs. York.

W. H. Myers.\n[The following is the newspaper account of the inquest, sent by Mr.\nMartyn Smith.]\nAnother inquest had reference to the death of Rose Foster (13), 32 Court,\n14 house, Camden-street, whose body was found in the canal at Spring Hill,\nthe 19th inst. [i.e. April 19th, 1895.] The mother stated that her daughter\nwas very nervous and frightened, especially at thunder and lightning. A\nlittle while ago she was told that she wa9 suffering from an affection of the\nkidneys, which would put her life in danger unless she was very careful. She\nhad been living with her aunt, but on Good Friday she came home of her\nown free will. On Wednesday she left the house suddenly, and was not seen\nalive by witness again. Several witnesses were called, who spoke to seeing\ndeceased sheltering from the thunderstorm under the bridge, and Thomas\nTarpler said he was in a boat on the canal near the bridge when the storm\nwas at its height, and he heard a scream and a splash, but he did not see\nany one. Elizabeth Turton stated that on Wednesday she was going with\nthe deceased over Spring Hill Bridge, when witness remarked to her, \" Oh,\nthat water !\" Witness said this because about twelve months ago she fell\ninto the water there. Deceased said, \"I feel as if I could jump over there,\"\n(meaning the bridge). Witness upon this said to deceased, \" Oh, you soon\nwant to part with your life. I have not seen enough enjoyment yet.\"\nFoster answered, \" You don't know what trouble I have had to go through.\"\nMrs. Jeffrey, of the George Inn, Grove-lane, Smethwick, aunt of the\ndeceased, said the girl had lived with her for some weeks. She was sulky,\nand witness told her she would have to go back home if she did not behave\nherself. Thereupon the girl left of her own accord. On Thursday the\ngirl's brother came to tell her she was missing. That night witness dreamt\nthat she was walking along the towing-path of the canal to her sister's\nhouse, and that while stirring the water with her umbrella she saw the\nface of her niece. Next morning she went to the scene, and found the\npolice dragging underneath the bridge. She asked them to drag at the\nspot where in her dream she saw the face. They did so, and at once found\nthe body. It was some distance from the bridge.\nMr. Martyn Smith also sends us the following notes of his interviews with\nMrs. Jefferies. and with the Police Inspector who superintended the dragging\nof the canal :\u2014\nMay Uttt, 1895.\nMrs. Jefferies, of the George Inn, Grove Lane, Smethwick, says it was\nthe Wednesday after Good Friday that her niece (Foster) was missing. On\nthe following day her (Mrs. Jefferies') nephew, brother of the niece, called\non his aunt, saying that he did not think she was alive, as some girls had\ntold him his sister had said she would not speak to them again\u2014meaning she\nwould not see them\u2014and he suspected she was drowned. The aunt said,\n\" Oh, I should not take any notice of that, she'll turn up,\" or something to\nthat effect. Mrs. J., however, continued to think about it (as her niece used\nto live with her), and the same night, Thursday, had a dream. She thoughts\nshe was walking along the side of the canal at Spring Hill with an umbrella,\nwhich she let touch to ripple the water ; when at a certain spot she saw the\nface of her niece appear above the surface twice, and the second time she\ncaught it by the hair, lifted her out and clasped her to her breast and kissed\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 391\nher. She woke up after the dream much terrified. She told it to her servant\nand may have told it to others.\nThe next morning (Friday) she heard that the police were dragging the\ncanal and went\u2014she had not been near the spot for 5 or 6 years before\u2014and\nspoke to the sergeant, told him of her dream, and asked if he would try the\ndrag at the place she had seen the face in her dream. They did so. The face\nofthe girl appeared above the water just as she had seen it (in sleep) ; it sank\nagain, and the second time the face appeared in the same position, and the\nbrother leaped into the water and clasped the body to his breast and kissed\n, the face as the aunt had dreamt she herself had done.\nMrs. Jefferies says that previous to anything unusual happening to her or\nher connexions she has some \" warning \" by dreams. She is sister to the\nmother of the drowned girl. She did not know before her dream that the\ncanal would be dragged, nor had she received any intimation about it.\nBirmingham, May 7th, 1895.\nActing-Inspector Whittingham was told off in charge of two minor officers\nto drag the canal near to the spot where the girl had been last seen. While\nthere he was accosted by the aunt, who stood by the canal side and appeared\nto take great interest in what was going on, and she asked him whether she\nmight tell him a dream that she had had the previous night. Thereupon she\nexplained that in her dream she had a clear view of the dying girl, but some\ndistance from the spot where they were then dragging\u2014about 55 to 60 yards.\nThe inspector suggested that the men should go to the other spot, and\nrecommenced the dragging, and they came across the body at the point\nuidicated, the fourth or fifth time of putting in the drag.\nMaetyn Smith.\nThese experiences, however,\u2014call them what you will, travelling\nclairvoyance or cosmopathic impressibility,\u2014are not evoked by deaths\nalone. The case of the Venus of Milo has already suggested that there\nmay be something like short excursions in which some fact near in place\nor in interest is learnt. Sometimes these impressions take the form\nof dreams, in which case there is generally some admixture of fantastic\ndetail. Sometimes a new belief or mental picture seems to survive\nfrom sleep ; sometimes the fact is given through automatic writing, or\nthrough crystal-vision.\n^ In all cases the possibility of hyperesthesia has to be considered ;\nbut, postponing for the moment that discussion, I will here compare\nsix cases, (one of them previously published) which will give an idea\nof this apparent diffusion of knowledge without any very obvious\ntelepathic channel. In all of these, however, a somewhat indirect\ntelepathy may be plausibly conjectured.\nThe cases concern a stolen linch-pin and a stolen horse, and a lost\ndog, book, watch, and ship. In the case of the stolen linch-pin the\ndreamer seems to have received an obscure notion of a mischievous\ntrick which had been played on a neighbour, before or during the\ndream.\n\f392 F. W. H. Myers.\nP. 131.\nFrom Commander F. M. Norman, R. N., J.P. of Berwick.\nCheviot House, Berwick-on-Tweed, February 19th, 1890.\nOn February 17th, 1890, I dreamed that I was driving, or being driven,\nalong the road near my house in an open cart with one horse. A man whom\nI saw passing called out loudly, ' ' Look out, look out, take care ! \" On\nlooking over the side of the cart, I saw the wheel had come off, apparently\nowing to the loss of the linch-pin, and was rolling away by itself towards\nthe bank. The cart did not overturn, and I then awoke and got up.\nAfter breakfast I opened my gate for the purpose of going to town. The )\nfirst person whom I saw was a farmer, well known to me, by name Anderson.\nHe immediately complained to me that as soon as he went out of his house\nthat morning he observed one of the linch-pins of his cart lying on the\nground, the cart itself having been driven off by his son, who was evidently\nignorant of his danger. Anderson had run after the cart, and had succeeded\nin restoring the linch-pin to its place without any accident having happened,\nthough the cart had travelled more than a mile.\nI may add that he said that it had been done, he felt sure, on purpose,\nby a man who owed him a grudge.\nF. M. Norman.\nIn a subsequent letter our informant adds :\u2014\nMarch 6th, 1890.\nAfter I dreamed, I woke. I woke just as I saw the wheel rolling away.\nThen I went to sleep again, and woke at the usual time for getting up. l\u00a3\nam not able to fix the hour of the dream.\nI cannot give or suggest any connecting link at all. I had not spoken to\nthe farmer for many days before, and nothing beyond \"Good morning\" for\nweeks, and certainly I had not been reading or talking about anything that\nwould lead up to the dream.\nIt is notable that the cart of my dream in which I was standing up was a\none-horse farm cart. In such a cart I had never set foot since I came to\nthis place 13 years ago.\nI spoke to no one about my dream till I met the farmer, who was the first\nperson whom I met, just outside my gate, and he at once accosted me with,\n\"Captain, did you ever lose your helm at sea?\" Not seeing exactly his\ndrift, I asked him why, or what he meant, and then he told me where he\nhad been, and what for.\nThe farmer was not a man who would be likely to come to me for help\nor advice. His son was in my Bible-class for years, and I used to call\nnow and then to see the parents, but that is all. Not the son in the cart.\nAt the same time, also, the farmer would, no doubt, often think of me, and\nso would his family, as I take a prominent part in public affairs here.\nMy dreams are few and far between, and are nearly ahcays about the sea\nand early recollections.\nIf I eat anything that causes \" nightmare \" it takes the form of\n\" dodging\" shells in the trenches before Sevastopol, where I served.\nI don't dream of Berwick, its people, or surroundings, more than once in\nthree years.\nCaptain Norman writes again on March 10th, 1890 :\u2014\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 393\nHerewith I have pleasure in sending you \"statements \" by the Anderson\nfamily. You wiU observe that Margaret's dream arrests attention in two\nparticulars. (1) That she dreamed about me on the night before the cart\nwas taken out. (2) That she dreamed about the child of the man whom her\nfather suspected. I may say that when I met her father outside my gate, ho\nmentioned Z. as the suspected pel-son ; but in my account to you, I believe\nI purposely suppressed the name.\nAnderson declares that I have not been mentioned inside his house for a\nlong time before the occurrence.\nF. M. Norman.\n[Margaret Anderson's dream omitted as not clearly coincidental.]\nStatement by Mr. Anderson, Farmer, High Greens, Berwick-on-Tweed :\u2014\nBetween nine and ten on the morning of Tuesday, February 18th, 1890,\nI went out into my yard, and I at once observed a linch-pin lying in a corner\nclose to the place where my cart usually stands. It immediately struck me\nthat some one who owed me a grudge had taken the pin out of the axle\nWore my cart had been driven off to my meadow by my son. I lost no\ntime in pursuing the cart, which I caught up just beyond Captain Norman's\ngate. Fortunately, no accident had happened, and my son was not aware\nthat anything was wrong. I gave him the pin and he replaced it. Directly\nafterwards Captain Norman came out of his gate, and on my telling him the\nnature of my errand he said that he had dreamed during the past night that\nhe was driving in a cart along the road, and one wheel rolled off for want\nof a linch-pin.\nMichael Anderson.\nStatement by Peter, son of the above :\u2014\nAbout 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday, February 18th, 1890, I harnessed my\nfather's horse to the farm cart, and drove past Captain Norman's house in\nthe direction of our meadows. Just after I had passed Captain Norman's\ngate I heard some one shouting after me. On looking round I saw my\nfather, who ran up and produced our linch-pin, which he said some one had\ntaken out before I started, but I had noticed nothing wrong, and the wheel\nwas in its place. I replaced the pin and proceeded.\nPeter Anderson.\nWitness to the above two signatures :\u2014 Margaret Anderson.\nSince Commander Norman was a Justice of the Peace, and well\nknown in the neighbourhood, it is perhaps just possible that the\nthoughts of the offender may have \" flown to \" the magistrate who\nwould be likely to punish his malice, if detected.\nThe case of the stolen horse (L. 841, printed in Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII., p. 399) resembles the linch-pin case, but the dream is much\nmore vivid and urgent. The emotion and perspiration during sleep\nsuggest that the dreamer seemed to himself to be actually witnessing\nthe theft with a sense of ineffectual rage and distress.\nThe case of the lost dog involves the apparent discernment of a\nfairly continuous scene. Telepathy from the maid-servant alone could\n\f394 F. W. H. Myers.\nscarcely account for the whole vision ; but we may, perhaps, conjecture\nthat the mind of the finder of the dog was also in some way involved.\nL. 969.\nThe following account was received, in 1893, from Miss C. H. Grange,\n34, Old Broad-street, E.C.\n\" I was staying with friends in one of the Eastern Counties. Shortly\nafter I had come, my friend, Mrs. B., wrote to her sister in the North,\nasking her to send off by train the colley dog which was only waiting at ,:\nthe old home until his mistress was ready to receive him. We were all\nanxious to welcome ' Barrie, ' who was an old friend, and accordingly were\nexceedingly pleased when a letter arrived, saying that he had been duly\ndespatched by express train. This letter arrived on a Monday morning,\nand the writer added, 'The station-master here tells me that \"Barrie\"\nshould reach on Monday morning, or possibly even on Sunday, if\nnot delayed in London.'\n\"One o'clock came, and with it the sad intelligence that as yet nothing\nhad been heard of our colley. At intervals during that afternoon and\nevening one or other of us might have been seen on the platform, inter\nviewing porters as to the probable cause of the delay experienced hy\n' Barrie ' on his journey.\n\" Tuesday's letter bag contained a letter saying, 'To-day I have had a\ntelegram from the station-master at York, saying that on Saturday afternoon\n\" Barrie \" slipped his collar and disappeared.' <t\n\" The days passed by, and we never failed to include the station in our\ndaily walk, always with the same question on our lips ' Any news of\nMrs. B's dog t ' but a favourable reply never came.\n\" [On Friday of the same week] we arranged to visit Cambridge, and to\nspend several hours in that most interesting town. On the return journey,\nbeing very tired, most complete was the silence which fell upon us. As\nfar as I can remember, no one had mentioned ' Barrie's ' name since the\nusual inquiry had been made in the morning, and indeed, as a week had\nnow elapsed since his loss, we were beginning [to give up the hope of\nrecovering him].\n\" Like all the rest, I was in a semi-sleeping condition. I do not say asleep,\nfor then what follows would be a dream, and certainly it was scarcely that\u2014\nno, merely in a tired condition of mind and body, I felt that peculiar sensa\ntion which I am sure has been felt by many, that is, that though sufficiently\nawake to know what is going on around, still your real mind seems to be far\naway and almost separate from your surroundings. It seemed to me that I\nwas walking down a road, and before mo I could see quite plainly the colley\ndog of which we had spoken and thought so much, being led by a man who\nheld him with a rope. I followed him with interest until he was taken up to\na door which I saw opened, and the flood of light from within showed me\nthe well-known figure of Mrs. B.'s maid-servant. It all appeared to me\nso vivid that I suddenly started up and said to Mrs. B., ' Edith, \" Barrie \"\nis found ! ' Every one was taken aback by the suddenness of this state\nment, and Mrs. B. laughingly said, ' Nonsense ! how can you possibly\nknow, and why raise false hopes in my mind '! ' I then, quite awake and\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 395\nlooking most intently at her, replied, ' Yes, he is found, and when we arrive\nat Station the first thing to happen will be that a porter will come up\nand say, \"Mrs. B., your dog is found.\"' Then I went on describing the\nscene of which I had just imagined myself to be a witness, saying, ' Ah,\nthere I see him going down the road. Now the maid is opening the\ndoor.' Here there was a universal laugh, and at last I joined in it, whereat\nall visions vanished. Still I maintained my opinion that the colley was\nsafe in , and when Dr. B. remarked that if all happened as I had said,\nI should have a pair of gloves, I agreed, and promised him a pair if\n' Barrie ' should prove still to be missing.\n\"In about forty minutes after this the train drew up at , and\nDr. B. opened the door and stepped out. Just as he was giving his hand\nto Edith, a porter came up to her and said, 'Mrs. B., your dog is\nfound.' She exclaimed, ' Where is he ?' The man replied by whistling to\na fellow porter, who brought the dog from the other end of the platform,\nand ' Barrie ' was soon overwhelming his mistress with rather boisterous\ncaresses. On our way home, Dr. B. remarked that I was only entitled\nto one glove, as the scene I had so graphically described of the dog being led\ndown the road, was a myth. But On our arrival at the house, our first greet\ning from the maid was, ' Oh, it really is your dog, Mrs. B. ? I would not\ntake him in when the porter brought him about three-quarters of an hour ago.'\n\"I was paid the bet. \u201e0 H Grangb \u201e\nMiss Grange tells us that the incident occurred in April, 1884, and that\nthe above account was written some weeks later, on her return home from\nvisiting Mrs. B.\nDr. and Mrs. B. added to the account a corroborative note, signed by\nboth of them, to the following effect :\u2014\n\" Without accepting any psychical theory whatever as bearing upon the\nsubject, we can state that the above-mentioned facts have been to the best\nof our recollection quite correctly recorded.\"\nThis note was written in May, 1893.\nA letter from Mrs. B. to Miss Grange, enclosing it, says :\u2014\" I remember\nabout it, and what I forget Dr. B. says he remembers, and vice versa, so we\ncan with a clear conscience sign it for you.\"\nThe case of the lost book continues and corroborates a previous\nA series of similar experiences on the part of the same informant (see\nProceedings, Vol. IX., chapter on Motor Automatism).\nP. 201. Statement by Lady Vane :\u2014\nHutton in the Forest, April 8th, 1894.\nAbout a month ago I lost a book, a manuscript one, relating to this\nhouse. I thought I had left it in my writing-table in my sitting-room, and\nintended to add a note about some alterations just completed\u2014but next day\nthe book had vanished. I looked through every drawer and cupboard in my\nroom and then asked' Sir Henry to do the same, which he did twice. 1 also\nmade the head housemaid turn everything out of them and helped her to do\nso\u2014so that four thorough searches were made ; but in vain. We also looked\n\f396 F. W. H. Myers.\nin the gallery and library (the only other rooms to which the book had been\ntaken) and could not find it. On March 28th I asked Lady Mabel Howard\nto write about it. She wrote, \"It is in the locked cupboard in the book\ncase\u2014hidden behind the books. \"\nI said, \"Then it must be in the library, because the bookcases are\nlocked,\" and Lady Mabel wrote, \" Not in the library.\" I said, \"Then it\nmust be in the ante-room in the cupboard,\" and asked if I should find it.\nLady Mabel wrote, \"No, send Sir Henry.\" I asked, \" Will he find it?\"\nand she wrote, \" Of course.\"\nStill thinking it could only be the ante-room or the library\u2014on account\nof the locked cupboard and bookcase, I asked, \" Which end of the room ? \"\nLady Mabel wrote, \" The tapestry end.\" I asked, \"Is it on the window\nBide of the room or on the other? \" and she wrote, \"The other.\" A. friend\nstaying in the house looked in the bookcases in the library at the tapestry\nend, and in the cupboard in the ante-room (I had met with an accident\nand could not go myself) and could not find the book, so we gave it up.\nOn April 5th Sir Henry was in my sitting-room and suddenly said, \" I\nhave an idea ! Lady Mabel meant this room. There is the bookcase and the\nlocked cupboard in it\u2014and the wall outside the door is covered with tapes\ntry.\" I said, \"You have looked in that cupboard twice, and so have I and\nthe housemaid, and the book is not there\u2014but look again if you like.\" Sir\nHenry unlocked tho door of the cupboard and took out all the books (there\nwere not more than half-a-dozen) and put them on the floor. The last he\nput back into the cupboard was a scrap-book for newspaper cuttings, and as\nit was rather dark at 6.30 p.m. he could not see the name on the back and\ntherefore opened it to see what it was, and the lost manuscript book fell out.\nHaving searched this very small cupboard four times previously, either of\nus would have been ready to swear that this book was not in it.\n(Signed) Margaret Vajte.\nHbnry Vanr.\nWriting to Mr. Myers about this case on April 10th, from Greystoko\nCastle, Penrith, Lady Mabel Howard says :\u2014\nThe day I got your letter I got a special letter sent over from Hutton\nto say my pencil had found a valuable book that Lady Vane had lost. We\ntherefore walked over there on Sunday and I asked her to write it out.\nIt is so very curious, quite the best thing I think the pencil ever has done\u2014\nas it said, \"in tho cupboard in the bookcase,\" and they couldn't think\nwhere it meant\u2014a cupboard in a bookcase \u2014and this little cupboard is a\ncupboard in the middle let into glass bookcases on either side. I had uo\nidea of the cupboards or tapestries there, and the pencil wrote all this in the\nsandwich paper at luncheon on the Point-to-Point race course.\"\nSo curious, too, the pencil said, \"Send Sir Henry,\" twice. It was the\nmerest chance finding it, as it fell out of this scrapbook, and was hidden\nbehind the other books.\nIn another letter, dated April 14th, Lady Mabel Howard writes :\u2014\nI saw Lady Vane on February 24th when the book had not been lost.\nI did not see her again till Easter Monday. The moment I got upstairs she\nexclaimed, \" I want you to find a book for me that is lost.\" No pencil nor\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 397\npaper was forthcoming, so she said, \"Never mind, write when you get\nhome,\" but I forgot, and it was two days after at the Point-to-Point race\nthat she asked me again, and we wrote it in the paper the sandwiches had\nbeen in.\nI was abroad all this March and it was then that there were repairs being\ndone in the house, and Lady Vane took the book down from where she kept\nit (I don't know where) and having entered the repairs into it, put it down,\nand from that moment it was never seen again. I must have been at Florence\nwhen the book was lost.\n' Marel Howard.\nAre we to describe this as a knowledge of past, of present, or of\nfuture? Or may we say that a telsesthetic perception of this kind is not\nstrictly conditioned by time, but includes some retrogressive knowledge\nas to how things reached their present condition, and also some\nprogressive inference as to their coming development ? The element of\nforecast in the present case,\u2014the indication that it would be Sir\nHenry Vane who would find the book,\u2014is in itself very slight ; but it\ncannot be ignored when we compare other messages of Lady Mabel\nHoward's. See, for instance, the messages to Mr. Huth, Vol. IX.,\np. 46, where the element of precognition was strongly marked. In\nthis present case, the whereabouts of the book can hardly have been\nsupraliminally known to any human being ; since the workman or\nservant whose hands may have slipped it into the larger book was\nprobably unaware of what it was, or even of his own unthinking\naction itself. If, however, it were Sir Henry or Lady Vane who\nunthinkingly placed the small book in the larger one\u2014and this does\nnot seem quite impossible\u2014Lady Mabel's knowledge might have been\ndrawn telepathically from their subliminal memory.\nIn the case of the lost icalch, to be next quoted, it might similarly be\nsuggested that the loser's subliminal self had seen the watch fall, and\nafterwards communicated that knowledge telepathically to his sleeping\nfriend. The analogy of other cases, however, would seem rather to\npoint to an excursion or extension of the dreamer's perception, so as to\n, include the field where the watch was found.\nP. 176. J. L. Squires.\nProf. Jasies,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I am informed that you are at the head of\nthe Boston Branch of the English Society of Psychical Research, and beg to\ncall your attention to a singular incident which took place near here some\ntime ago, and which has never been chronicled. It is, in brief, as follows :\u2014\nA young man of this place, J. L. Squires by name, was at work on the\nfarm of T. L. Johnson, with another young man, Wesley Davis, who was one\n'lay far from the buildings mending fence around a large pasture. Squires was\nnot with him, nor had he ever been far into the pasture. At some time dur\ning the day Davis lost his watch and chain from the vest pocket, and although\n2 G\n\f398 F. W. H. Myers.\nhe searched diligently, could not find it, as he had no idea as to the probable\nlocality of the watch. Although only a silver watch, Davis worked for a\nliving and could hardly afford its loss.\nIn his sympathy for his friend, Squires could not keep his mind off the\nwatch, and after two or three days thinking of it, went to bed one night still\nthinking of it. During the night he had a dream, or vision, as we may call\nit, and saw the watch lying on the ground with the chain coiled in a peculiar\nposition : rocks, trees and all the surroundings were perfectly plain to him.\nTelling his story at the breakfast table, he was, of course, well laughed at,\nbut being so convinced that he could go straight to the watch, he saddled a\nhorse and found it exactly as he expected to.\nAll the parties concerned are wholly honest and reliable. I will have a\ndetailed statement sworn to if you would like it.\nJohn E. Gale, Guilford, Vermont.\nIn the month of March, 1887, I, Jesse L. Squires, of Guilford, in the\ncounty of Windham, and State of Vermont, being then in the twenty-third\nyear of my age, began working for T. L. Johnson, a fanner living in the\ntown aforesaid.\nIn the month of September following\u2014the exact day of the month I do\nnot remember\u2014I was about one mile from the farm buildings with a young\nman named Wesley Davis, with whom I had for several years been acquainted,\nand who had been working with me at said Johnson's for several months, look\ning after some cattle that had strayed from a pasture. The cattle, eighteen or .\ntwenty head, were found in a large mow lot, and seeing us, started to run\naway in a direction opposite to that in which we wished to drive them. In\norder to head off the cattle and turn them back, Davis ran one way and I\nthe other, and while running Davis lost his watch and chain from his vest\npocket, but did not discover his loss until eight or nine o'clock that night,\nwhen it was, of course, too late to search for it. Believing that he must have\nlost the watch while engaged in getting the cattle back into the pasture,\nDavis and myself returned to the place the next morning and looked for the\nwatch all the forenoon. Not having any idea of the probable locality in\nwhich the watch was lost, and not being at all certain that it was lost while\nafter the cattle, we did not succeed in finding it, although we searched for it\nuntil twelve o'clock. The watch was one that Davis had had for some time,\nand he was much attached to it, and felt very badly about his loss. He\nworked hard for his living, and could not afford to lose the watch, for which\nhe had paid twenty-fivo dollars. I felt sorry for him, and thought about the\nwatch continually all the afternoon after we returned from looking for it, and\nwas still thinking of it when I went to sleep that night.\nDuring my sleep, at what hour I could not tell, I saw the watch as it lay\nupon the ground in the mow lot, over a mile away. It was in the tall grass,\nat least ten inches high. The face of the watch was turned up, and the\nsmall steel chain which was attached to it, lay in a curve like a half circle.\nAbout three feet from the watch was a large spot where the grass had been\ncrushed and matted by a creature lying down ; about ten rods to the north\nwas a brush fence ; about ten or twelve feet to the eastward of the watch\nwas a granite cobble stone one or two feet in diameter, which lay about half\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 399\nout of the ground. When I awoke the next morning, which was Sunday, I\nfelt as certain that I could go straight to the watch as if I had really seen it,\nand told Davis so, and tried to have him go out and get it. He had no faith\nin my \"vision,\" \" dream,\" or whatever it may be called, and would not go.\nIn spite of the jests and laughter of the entire family, I saddled a horse and\nwent directly to the watch, which I found with all its surroundings exactly\nas I had seen it. I was not nearer than forty rods to Davis when the watch\nwas lost, as I ascertained after it was found.\nThe watch had run down and stopped, the hands pointing to 9.40 o'clock,\nwhich I also noted in my dream.\nJ. L. Squires.\nGuilford,Vermont, March 4th, 1892.\nI hereby certify that I have known the above J. L. Squires for over\ntwenty years, and that I know him to be strictly temperate, honest, and\ntruthful. He has always been in the best of health. He tells me that he\nhas recently had an experience similar to the above, which I will send you,\nifyou wish.\nIf the above Ls ever put in type, please tell me where I can get a copy.\nJohn E. Gale, Justice of the Peace.\nThe narrative, which next follows, of the lost ship,\u2014the finding of\nthe Carnatic,\u2014originally published in Harper's Magazine, without\nCapt. Sargent's corroboration, has been greatly increased in evidential\nvalue by that added testimony. Here, again, there seems a confusion\nor coalescence of times, and a telepathy verging upon telesthesia. If\nthe central psychical fact was the appeal of Morton for help, yet the\nseries of scenes cognised seems to have involved the ship's striking\nupon a rock some hours before, and a representation of the landscape\nof the disaster.\nP. 175. Lowell, Mass.,\nOctober 18th, 1890.\nRichard Hodgson, Esq., Boston.\nDear Sir,\u2014Replying to your favour of the 17th, I send you a copy of\nHarper's Magazine for August, 1880, with the article marked in \"Editor's\nDrawer.\" The episode there related is probably the basis of the erroneous\nreport which has drifted so strangely to you. The matter as written in\nHarper is not embellished nor exaggerated in the least. I can vouch for the\nabsolute truth of the narrative.\nGeorge A. Hanscom.\nFrom Harper's Magazine, August, 1880.\nThe following statement of singular facts, recalled by a recent article in\nthis magazine, is contributed by Mr. George A. Hanscom, of Lowell,\nMassachusetts.\nThe reading of the \"Puzzle for Metaphysicians \" in the June number of\nyour monthly, recalls to the writer the most remarkable occurrence of like\n2 a 2\n\f400 F. W. H. Myers.\nnature which a nautical experience of twenty years afforded. This is\nanother of those experiences which go to prove the occasional thinness of\nthe curtain which limits the natural vision of mortals.\nIn 1869 I was in Suez, in command of the British steamship Neiera,\nbelonging to the Bombay and Bengal Steamship Company\u2014a company\nowning a line of steamers born of the necessities of the manufacturing\nworld, when the supply of American cotton was so largely cut off by the\nWar of the Rebellion. The line was under the management of William F.\nStearns, now deceased, son of the late Professor Stearns, of Amherst\nCollege, a man who, going to India penniless, developed qualities which\nenabled him to rise on the flood tide of prosperity to a colossal fortune and\nhigh social position, but, as it.proved, only to see his riches float out on the\nreceding tide, and leave his family but poorly provided for at his untimely\ndeath.\nThe Neiera was lying in Suez-roads, the canal being not yet open, await\ning passengers, etc., before sailing on her return voyage to Bombay. The\nPeninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Carnatic was also about\nready to sail for the same port, and only waiting mails and passengers. It\nhappened that the passengers for the two steamers came across the Isthmus\ntogether, and that two old friends and school-mates met, the one to join the\nNesera, the other the Carnatic. A day was spent by the friends, who un\nexpectedly met on the Egyptian desert, in recounting their experience since\nthey last parted, and naturally enough there was a good deal of badinage\nbetween them as to the comparative merits of the two steamers, and as to\nwhich should first land on the \" coral strand,\" upon which these \"griffins\"\nwere to be initiated into their duties in the \" Civil Service,\" to which they\nhad been newly appointed.\nThe Carnatic was the first to be ready, and sailed from Suez in the morn\ning ; the Neera left early in the evening, some ten or twelve hours after the\nmail steamer. The night was fine, and at breakfast time we had passed\nShaduan Island, were out of the Gulf of Suez, and into the Red Sea proper.\nBreakfast was served on deck, under double awnings of heavy canvas. The\nyoung gentleman who had left his friend the day before seemed somewhat\ndepressed in spirits, and during breakfast said rather anxiously, \" Captain, at\nwhat time did we stop last night 1 \"\n\" Stop ! we have not stopped since leaving,\" was the reply.\n\" Not even to take soundings ? \"\n\"No, the engines have not been eased since leaving port.\"\nThe young man seemed much surprised, and finally said that he had a\nmost vivid and remarkable dream during the night, and this he proceeded to\nrelate in substance as follows :\u2014\n\"In my dream it appeared to me that the steamer was stopped during the\nnight, and that I went on deck to ascertain the cause. I saw a boat pulling\noff from an island to intercept us, and a lantern was waved to arrest our\nattention. As the boat came nearer I saw my friend Morton standing in the\nstern. As he came up the gangway ladder I said, ' For God's sake, Morton,\nwhat brings you here ? ' I never saw him plainer, nor heard his voice more\ndistinctly than when he said, ' The Carnatic has struck a rock and gone\ndown ; the passengers and crew are on an island close by, all safe, and we\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 401\nwant your ship to take them on board.' I dreamed that our ship stopped\nuntil other boats came off with the remainder of the people, and we then\nproceeded.\"\nThe narration of the dream made a profound impression upon the\npassengers, but the captain, as in duty bound, laughed it off. The young\nman proved a jolly sort of fellow, but was called \"the dreamer \" during the\nrest of the voyage.\nOn arrival at Aden five days later, before our anchor was down, we were\nhailed by a boat which had been despatched from the Peninsular and\n> Oriental office, and asked if we had any news of the Carnatic, that ship being\na day overdue. We had no news to give ; but our \"dreamer\" quietly\nremarked to me, \"You may find that there is more to my dream than you\nsuppose.\"\nA few hours completed our coaling, and we were off again for Bombay.\nOn arrival at that port we heard the news of the loss of the Carnatic, and the\ncircumstances were just as narrated to us two weeks before. The ship\nstruck on a rock near Shaduan Island some twelve hours after leaving Suez.\nThe passengers and crew were landed on the island ; the steamer subse\nquently slid off the rock and went down in deep water. During the night a\nsteamer's light were seen by the shipwrecked crew, and a boat was sent out\nto intercept her. Our \" dreamer's \" friend, Morton, went in the first boat ;\nthe remainder of the people were subsequently taken on board, and the rescu\ning steamer, not the Nesera, rescued the party. The \"dreamer\" told the\nstory as well as it could be told to-day.\nIt seems probable that our \" dreamer's \" vision was shown him at the very\nmoment the ship-wrecked people were embarking upon the steamer which\ncame to their aid, and that the Neiera was not ten miles from the scene at\nthe time.\nIt may be stated in conclusion, to show the perfection to which the postal\nsystom of the world has arrived, that the only letter addressed to the writer\nwhich ever failed to reached him in all his twenty years' wanderings, went\ndown in the Carnatic.\nLowell, Mass., May 2nd, 1893.\nR. Hodoson, LL.D.,\u2014Dear Sib,\u2014Replying to your favour of the 28th\nult., I thiiiic I wrote you long ago that I cannot now tell the whereabouts of\nMorton. It was more than twenty years\u2014nearly twenty-five years ago, and\nI have long ago largely lost touch with both England and British India. If,\nhowever, the matter should be published, with an intimation that you would\nlike to hear from him, he will come to the front - certainly so if published in\nthe English and Indian branches of the Society,\u2014if he is still alive. \"The\npower of the press \" is far-reaching. I can, however, give you one important\nwitness in the person of Captain R. W. Sargent, 708, Pine-street, Phila\ndelphia. Sargent was chief officer of the \" Neiera \" and knew all the circum\nstances at first hand. He, Sargent, now occupies an important position in\nthe Cramp Steamshipbuilding Company, having recently left the sea after\nmany years in the American Steamship Line, by whom he was deputed last\nyear for a trip on the Russian Relief Service. I cannot think of any other\nwhose present address I can give. Possibly he can.\n\f402 F. W. H. Myers.\nThe matter published in Harper was, however, written without embellish\nment when the case was fresh in mind, and may be relied upon.\nGeo. A. Hanscom.\n1358, Hanover-street, Philadelphia, Pa.,\nNovember 10th, 1893.\nDr. Richard Hodgson, LL.D.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014Captain George Hanscom\nwrote me about the matter, and a year ago, February last, I talked the\n\" Carnatic \" incident over with him at his home in Lowell, Mass. He read\nthe article from Harper's for August, 1880, to me, and asked me if in my\nmemory he had stated the case as it was. As well as I can remember, the\nstatement is absolutely true, but he has not gone into the details as much\nas he might have done, had he taken a more active interest in psychology.\nI was second officer with him at the time, and thrown more in contact\nwith the young man. As I got older I became very much interested in these\nsubjects and probably have told the story hundreds of times to saloon\npassengers in steamships I have commanded, as it is to me one of the clearest\ncases on record of something leaving a man and coming back to him.\nI cannot agree with Captain Hanscom as to the young man saying it was\na \"dream.\" He insisted he saw it all, he resented it being considered a\n\"dream.\"\nI do not remember the names of either of the young men, and have not\nheard of either of them since.\nThe young men were going out to enter the telegraph service, and the\nparty divided, as a part of them wished a day longer in Egypt. The young\nman on the Nesera, as well as we could find out, never saw the Carnatic. Yet\nhe described her to us quite as well as if he had been on board.\nHe had never been down the Gulf of Suez ; probably Captain Hanscom\nforgot this. In my presence he asked him to describe the place where the\nship struck and where the passengers were, with the general look of the land,\nwhich he did. When we were alone, Captain Hanscom, who was very much\nimpressed with the story, said to me, \"Mr. Sargent, where did the ship\nstrike, what place did the people land, and what was the high land he saw\nin the distance?\" I replied, \"The ship struck near Usshreifi Reef, the\nboat landed on the Island of Jubal, and the land on the right hand was\nShaduan, and on the left Ros Mohamed.\" He answered, \"That is what\nI make it.\"\nAfter twenty-four years this case, in its main points, is fresh in my\nmemory. I wish I could help you to trace the young men, but I cannot.\nTo me this one case has proved that some men have a dual personality.\nI, of course, have heard of others, but I was shipmates with this one,\nand it has settled the fact for me that there is something in man superior to\nmatter.\nR. W. Sargent.\nI will close this group of retrocognitive cases with a possible,\nbut obscure, telepathic basis by a curious incident where the\nretrocognised fact, although in one sense extremely accurate, was\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 403\nso presented as to be wholly misleading ; and in a way in which\nno assignable intelligence (unless it were a forgetful dream of the\ndeceased debtor's or of the satisfied creditor's) would have been\nlikely to have presented it.\nP. 170. Law Offices of H. and P.,\nNew Orleans, January 8th, 1894.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014-In May, 1889, I had purchased the residence property\n) where I now live, and of course had looked into the title, as to conveyances\nand liens. This work was concluded, when one night I dreamed this dream.\nI was walking through the business part of the city, and met our sheriff,\nwhosaid, \"I am going to sell that house and lot, corner of 2nd and Chestnut-\nstreets, for the claim of R. M v. J. C , for 446.50dols. \" I was\nannoyed, of course, thinking that there might have been some mistake in\nthe search for judgment liens -and then I woke up.\nJ. C had been a former owner. On my way down to my office next\nmorning I stopped to see his son, W. C , \u2014his successor in business,\u2014\nand as a kind of joke, told him my dream. As I told him his face lengthened\nvisibly, and without saying anything, he wont to his ledger and after looking\nat it said, \"You made a slight mistake in figures\u2014 it was 444.50dols.\"\u2014and\nthen, with a sort of awe, continued, \"But with the interest, figured here in\npencil, it was just 446.50dols.\" I should add that J. C had been\nembarrassed before his death, but had settled up his debts, so I had no\ntrouble. Now, had the claim been sued on, the sheriff and lien part of my\ndream had no truth, but the debt and amount were precise. I knew R.\nM very well, but never associated him in any way with J. C , nor\nhad the slightest reason, that I can recall, to suspect that C had ever\nhad any dealings with M , C being \"in cotton\" and M \"in\nsugar.\"\nW. W.

I remarked\nto him that it was very remarkable indeed that that amount would vary very\nlittle from what a liability would have been to Mr. M had it not been\npaid , and had drawn interest to that date. I referred to data and computed\nthe interest and was, as said before, quite startled to find that there was no\ndifference between the figures mentioned by him and what I found the\nliability to Mr. M would have been, had it not been paid off. I regret\nvery much that I did not make memorandum of this amount and the date, so\nthat it might have been given you explicitly and definitely, but did not, and\nwithout knowing the date, I cannot give even approximately the amount\nmentioned.\nI told the Judge, however, that there was an inaccuracy in the dream,\nand that was that Mr. M 's claim had never gone to judgment, nor had\nthere been any legal contention or contest about it ; but that it was a\nliability that had been settled in the regular course of business at the proper\ntime.\nWb. H. Chaffe.\nI must here leave for the present the study of knowledge of\nthings past or present received by telesthesia or by obscure telepathy,\n\u2014supernormal knowledge whose origin is not clearly traceable to\nany definite external intelligence ;\u2014and must pass on to the much\ncommoner type of messages, where knowledge of past or present (we\nare not yet dealing with things future) is claimed to proceed from some\nmore or less definite disembodied intelligence. The cases which we\nhave already studied form an extension of the scope of a man's own\npersonal memory or observation ; those on which we now enter form\nan extension of the scope of the things which he hears and reads, \u2014and\nfrom which he combines by selection and inference his main knowledge\nof the Past.\nMy reader already knows how confused and contradictory these\nsoi-disant spirit messages generally are. For the most part, as I have\noften urged, they may well be no more than externalised dreams,\nwhose source is wholly within the automatist's own intelligence.\nThis view I must now supplement by an endeavour to show that\neven if we suppose these messages to come from outside ourselves (as I\nhold that some of them certainly do), we need still feel no surprise at\ntheir generally unsatisfactory character. Even on that hypothesis\nthey are, I think, very much what the analogies of earthly life would\nlead us to expect.\nSuppose that the whole mass of statements, or signs of assent or\ndenial, which are presented to any man during a day of common life\nwere simply written out continuously, with no indication of their\nsource beyond what their content supplies, we should then have a\njumble much like that which automatic messages present. Let us try\nto compare the two scenes ; somewhat widening our ordinary categories\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 405\nso as to allow for the unknown conditions of the world from whence\nthese messages are alleged to come.\nIn the course of a day, then, I hear various direct statements from\nliving persons, who speak as they believe at the moment, and whom I\ncan question on what they say. I also read many written statements,\nwhose writers I cannot question ; these statements representing what\ntheir writers believed at a given moment in the past. The first of\nthese classes I may call direct statements ; the second, exuvial. They\n> are exuvial inasmuch as they represent a past state of the generating\nintelligence, as a snake's skin or a lobster's shell represents a past\nconformation of the animal's organism. The need of this general term\nto comprehend all statements detached from their authors,\u2014no longer\nsupported by a life behind them which can hear and answer questions,\u2014\nwill presently appear. And, thirdly, I both hear and read many\nstatements which neither now represent, nor ever represented, any\nindependent belief or truth. Such statements I may call parasitic,\nsince they are merely based upon some other mind's belief, or upon my\nown belief which they reflect to me, perhaps with no wish to deceive.\nThus a child assents to any story which I tell him,\u2014his object being not\nto controvert but to understand ;\u2014a dog shows sympathy with any\nemotion which I choose to express ;\u2014its impulse being merely to attain\ncompanionship with a mind above its own. Nay, my own dreams also\nare parasitic upon my waking day. They represent the best which\nsome fragment of my mind can effect ;\u2014a petty whirlwind that lifts\nthe chaff from the floor of my mental granary.\nNow my point is that whereas when we believe ourselves to be\ndealing with an unseen world we desire, and instinctively expect, that\nall messages which come to us shall be direct, the probability never\ntheless is that they will mainly be exuvial or parasitic.\nIf even the material world is so full as we find it of the exuvise of\npast thoughts and emotions,\u2014although such thoughts must be written\non paper, or spoken into phonographs, if the vibrations of brain or\nlarynx are not to wander irrecoverably away ; much more may a\nk supersensory, a telepathic world accumulate the mental exuvie which\nmay form, so to say, the environment in which its new life proceeds.\nWhat is likely to be there imaged and treasured, if not the Past of\nSouls 1 Some such images may be fleeting as shadows, some persistent\nas the imagined vortices of ether, or some may last a little longer than\nothers, as in a room tilled with smokers some smoke-rings float for a\nfew moments still discernible in the heavy air.\nWhat if the haunting ghost be such a smoke-ring among the\ndisintegrated images of other occupants of the house ? What if some\nisolated passionate statement, like that professing to come from the\nLeicester murderess, {Proceedings, Vol. IX., p. 99), should represent\n\f406 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe impress of some intense memory,\u2014a record which still in some\nsense coheres independently, and meets the sensitive's receptive power,\nmuch as a particle of organic d\u00e9bris floats within the tentacles of a\nsea-anemone?\nThis, then, may come, and nothing beyond it ; one message may\nbe given with ease and force ; after which there will be only silence,\nor a confused parasitic rehandling of the facts already given.\nAnd this brings me to my second category of subordinate and\nuntrustworthy communications,\u2014those which in the actual world I\nhave called parasitic.\nThe causes which lead to such communications on earth seem likely\nto be even more prevalent in a transcendental world. On this earth\nthe mere differences of bodily organisation which deprive the lower\nanimals of the power of speech prevent our direct contact with\nminds much below our own. In a world, on the other hand, where\nthought is directly communicated, it may well be that minds somewhat\non the level of the dog or the monkey may come into a closer relation\nthan here with the mind of man. And since the actual language in which\nautomatic messages are conveyed is almost always derived from our\nown brains, there seems no security against our confusing messages\ninspired by these lower intelligences with messages veritably coming\nfrom our departed friends. Such messages may show the wish to\nplease of the friendly dog, or the wish to tease of the mischievous\nmonkey. Possibly they may be mere attempts to understand, to get\ninto communication with our human minds. Whatever the temper\nwhich inspires them, they will be mere reflections or distortions of\nwhat we already know. Or again, just as I have elsewhere urged with\nregard to apparitions, so may these written messages also represent the\ndreams of the dead. They may, that is to say, be as partial and\nparasitic a product of a discarnate mind as our dreams are of minds\nstill incarnate. We have no right to assume that we are meeting the\nfull ray of the unseen intelligence,^-an intelligence which may be even\nmore liable to dispersion than is our own, and in traversing some\nobscure medium to reach us may leave much of its light behind.\nThere is yet one more supposition which some of the feebler mani\nfestations suggest. There may be an intelligence which is impermanent\nand almost impersonal, which is in some way generated from the mere\ncomflux of several incarnate minds bent in the same direction, or\npossibly is even parasitic upon a single human intelligence, like the\ndream which falls as a transient entity upon the sleeping mind of a\nHomeric hero.\nI have dwelt at length on all the possible sources of error in\nretrocognitive messages, because it seems to me important both to\nrecognise their existence to the full, and also to perceive that they do\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 407\nnot explain all the messages alleged to come from the dead. I regard\nthe memories of departed spirits\u2014the facts which they impart to us\nfrom their own store\u2014as constituting a real and most important\nsource of retrocognition. In the often-quoted case, for instance, of\nMr. Stainton Moses and Abraham Florentine, I hold that the\nsurviving spirit of Abraham Florentine did really communicate with\nMr. Moses, and that in this direction lie chances of knowledge which\nwe can hardly exaggerate. Many of the recent messages given\n) through Mrs. Piper, I may add, have seemed to belong to this type.\nBut on all these messages from departed spirits I have written so\nmuch already that there is no need for recapitulation here. I will add\none suggestion alone, to which much that has been recorded in this\npaper seems obscurely to point. Even when we are dealing with true\nretrocognitions involving scenes or histories in which men long\ndeparted have played their part, we must not assume that such\nknowledge must needs have come to us through the agency of some\ndefinite and assignable discarnate mind. We cannot indeed prove that\nthey have not so come. We cannot demonstrate that any given scene\nmay not have been presented by some spirit to whom that scene was\nonce familiar. But for aught we know, the scene may come to us\nwithout any such intervention. Its permanence in the Universe\ncannot depend upon its relation to any finite mind. If one image\npersists, then all images ; for the Omnipresent Mind includes them all.\nZSxri to Oia. Nothing for that Intelligence is \"drowned in the deeps\nof an infinite Past.\"\n\f408 F. W. H.

This\ntransition is both gradual and complicated ; and, just as many retro-\ncognitions already quoted have had some element of the future in them,\nso also among the precognitions with which we must now deal, there\nwill be many where what looks like knowledge of the future can be\nanalysed into an enlarged knowledge of what actually exists.\nThere are, indeed, certain phenomena\u2014 \"monitions\" as we term\nthem in these Proceedings\u2014which in common parlance are often spoken\nof as premonitions, and used as a type of knowledge of the future, where\nit is nevertheless plain that all that is needed is a somewhat extended\nperception of near facts. Mrs. Sidgwick has for this reason excluded\n\"Monitions\" from her paper on \"Premonitions\"; but they must\nneeds find their place in the present more generalised discussion of the\nRelation to Time of Supernormal Phenomena.\nThese monitions,\u2014of which we have already printed a good many\ninstances,\u2014range from incidents so trivial and momentary that it\nwould seem absurd to ascribe them to anything more dignified than a\nbarely subliminal stratum of the percipient's own consciousness, up to\nimportant warnings which claim the authority of some departed but\nstill watchful friend.\nAt the lower end of this series come the obscure intimations which\nrestrain us from action on grounds which perhaps are only just\nforgotten and still by effort recoverable. The chess player, returning\nafter various trains of calculation to the temptation of a specious move,\nwill dimly feel a sense of restraint ;\u2014\" I must not do tliat, though I\ncannot recollect why.\" Mrs. Verrall (Proceedings, Vol. XL, p. 190)\nhas noted instances where this subliminal warning presents itself as a\nphysical hesitation ;\u2014the hand refusing to execute an order which is\nreally unreasonable ;\u2014and which is felt to be such so soon as some\ntrivial recent fact is remembered.\nOne step further, and we have an actual externalised hallucination\nof touch checking the inconsiderate action. A lady throwing a handful\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 409\nof envelopes into the fire feels, in one of our cases, a hand laid upon\nher arm,\u2014pauses in surprise,\u2014and discovers that she is throwing\naway with the envelopes a roll of banknotes which in a moment of\ndistraction she has placed among them. We cannot surely assume an\nexternal agent here, without assuming also that it was some guardian\nangel which checked Mrs. Verrall, in her closely similar experience,\nfrom taking five envelopes from her stationery case when only four\nwere required.\n* Let us take one step further, and we come to monitions based upon\na fact apparently not forgotten merely, but never known ; a fact lying\ndemonstrably beyond the normal sensory cognisance of the percipient.\nA fact beyond his normal sensory cognisance, I say ; but obviously\nbefore we assume that he has perceived that fact in a transcendental\nor telassthetic fashion, we must make the fullest allowance for hyperes\nthesia,\u2014for an extension of the bodily senses which may include this\nstrange knowledge within its range. Nay more; our search for possible\nhyperesthesia is bound to be much wider than any search which the\nphysiologist is likely thus far to have found worth his pains. His interest\nhas lain in definite measurable extensions of the higher senses, rather\nthan in obscure and novel sensations which led to no clear end. It is\nfor these last, on the other hand, that it is our special duty to search.\nWe have obscure and novel facts to explain, and before we confidently\nassign them to psychical and transcendental cause?, we must try and\nthink of everything which the human body might conceivably discern\nor discover.\nI say \" the body \" rather than \" the senses \"; for we must go back\nin our inquiry (though of course without expectation of immediate\nsuccess) to an ancestral condition far anterior to any senses which we\nnow know. We must go back to the first germ of life, and in place of\nmerely crediting it with \" irritability,\" which is all the power of re\naction which it can actually show us, we must credit it with all the\npotentialities which the history of its descendants teaches us to infer\n^ as already latent in it. We know into how wide a gamut of feeling\n* the germ's vague internal sensation, its vague external sensation, have\ndiffused and specialised themselves in man. We dimly conjecture into\nwhat other rays the spectrum of that dim primal gleam of conscious\nness has been fanned out in animals other than man. And we may\nfeel assured also,\u2014though it be hard to realise the fact,\u2014that all the\nknown or guessed sensations of men and animals are but a small\nselection from the range of sensations potentially educible from the\nvague panasthesia,\u2014so to term it,\u2014of the primal germ. Average\nexperience within average limits ;\u2014that is all that our known senses\ncover. If the stimulus be too weak, we are liable to mistake the sense\nthrough which it comes to us ; if it be too strong, we are liable to feel\nin\n\f410 F. W. H. Myers.\na mere distress or bewilderment, not referred to any definite sense.\nIt is surely conceivable, then, that all our known sensibilities may\nform merely a kind of bull's-eye;\u2014the place where outer and inner\ninfluences oftenest touch our central sensorium ;\u2014while round this\nbull's-eye all kinds of unclassified obscure sensations probably scatter.\nIt follows that when we have to explain very strange perceptions\nwe must be on the look out, not only for the hyperesthesia of known\nsenses, but also for that more generalised form of hyperesthesia which\nmay involve senses (peripheral or central) as yet incipient and unrecog- '\nnised, although still depending on the material world,\u2014a wider selection\nfrom the potential pansesthesia of the primal germ. There may\u2014there\nmust\u2014be evolution still going on in us in relation to our material as\nwell as to our transcendental environment, and we must not claim\nphenomena for the latter without taking account of the former as well.\nOnce more ; we must remember that the assumed new sensitivities,\nphysical and transcendental, may be linked together in ways quite\nunknown to us. The synsesthesise which are only now beginning to be\nnoted between the ordinary senses ;\u2014of which \" coloured audition,\" or\nsound-seeing, is the accepted type ;\u2014may be carried yet further, and\nmay connect in unlooked-for ways man's responses to his physical and\nto his transcendental environments. There will be nothing to surprise t\nus if the same percipient should receive a number of subliminal\nintimations, of which some are to be referred to hypersesthesia and some\nto telesthesia, or to telepathy from the living or from the dead.1\nI have said that hypersesthesia may be peripheral or central ; \u2014that\nis to say, that it may consist in the heightened perception of sensations\ncoming from outside our organism, or from within the brain. I will\nbegin with some cases of apparent telesthesia, or of apparent prevision,\nwhich may possibly, though by no means certainly, be referable to an\nextension of the external senses.\nMy first case shall be taken from the experience of the late Rev.\nP. H. Newnham, known to readers of these Proceedings as a most\ncareful informant, and as agent in a long series of experiments which, in\nmy view, conclusively proved telepathy with his wife, Mrs. Newnham,\nwho still survives. He had throughout life many monitions, premonitory\ndreams, &c. ;\u2014but most of these unfortunately passed unrecorded at\nthe time ; and I mention them only to indicate that it would be difficult\nto explain by hyperesthesia all his experiences. In the case which\n1 One is so often asked how mediums are to be distinguished,\u2014or, rather, one is\nso often told that so-and-so \" look9 like a medium,\"\u2014that it is just worth saying that\nI at least can trace as yet no other quality whatever which seems to be habitually\nfound along with transcendental sensitivity ;\u2014unless it be (and even this is hardly\nmore than a guess) a special tendency to be influenced by the electrical condition of\nthe atmosphere.\n\fThe Svhliminal Self. 411\nfollows it is possible that although he had never seen Chaonia he might\nhave had a general notion of its aspect when flying, and might\nsubconsciously have seen it settle on the oak.\nP. 109. From the Rev. P. H. Newnham.\nI have on many occasions, throughout the last 35 years at least, experi\nenced the sensation of a soundless voice speaking words distinctly into my\near from outside of me. Whenever this has been the case, the information\ny or advice given has invariably proved correct.\nI distinguish this phenomenon clearly from the ordinary forms of \"pre\nsentiment.\" This voice is distinctly something ab extra. In presentiments,\nif certain words seem to come, thoy come from within, and are (so to speak)\nspoken voicelessly by myself, just as in verbal reading to yourself.\nI never pay any attention to these so-called \"presentiments.\" I have\nhad plenty of them, and find them more often false than true.\nBut, when this voice comes, it never fails.\nIn July 1858 (I believe, hut it may have been June, 1857), I was\nvisiting friends at Tunbridge Wells, and went out one evening, entomolo-\ngising. As I crossed a stile into a field, on my way to a neighbouring wood,\n:he voice distinctly said in my right ear, \" You'll find 'Chaonia' onthatoak.\"\n(This was a very scarce moth, which I had never seen before, and which most\nassuredly I had never consciously thought of seeing.) There were several\noaks in the field, but I intuitively walked up to one, straight to the off side\nof it, and there was the moth indicated.\nWith this last case two others should be compared, where the\nhypothesis of a subconscious hypersesthetic discernment of the bifid\nfern or the four-leaved clover by ordinary eyesight is possibly\napplicable.\nP. 241.\nFrom the \" Annates des Sciences Psychiques,\" Mai-Juin, 1895.\nBy M. Adrien Guebhard, Professeur Agreg\u00e9 a la Faculte- de M^decine.\nOn the 30th May, 1893, I was on a geological excursion in the environs\nV of Nice. After a very uneasy night, passed in the village of Contes, I set\n-* out in a rather bad humour in the direction of Escarene by an old road,\nwhere my disgust was heightened by seeing on my right a long mound of\nabsolutely no interest, either palseontological or stratigraphical. In vain I\ntried to console myself by seeking in the crevices of the moist, dripping\nstone, or under the tufts of green maidenhair, some rare snail-shell for a\ncollection belonging to my friends. I had already resigned myself to the\nuninteresting walk of the ordinary tourist, when suddenly a flash of\nrecollection arrested my wandering attention \u2014a memory dating from my old\npassion of long ago for botany, revived for a short time in 1889 by the publi\ncation of a work on the abnormal partitions of ferns, but certainly long since\nabandoned. Promptly, and with all the intensity of an old longing never\nsatisfied, I conceived a great ambition for an object which, having been\n\f412 F. W. H. Myers.\nvainly sought, had almost passed into a myth, namely, the Aspleninm\nTrichomanes, or Common Maiden-hair Spleenwort abnormally bifurcated,\nwhich I had often seen mentioned in a book, but which I had never once,\nduring thirty years, been able to discover, in spite of the great abundance of\nthe normal species.\nHardly was this mental picture evoked, before my eyes, as if drawn by\nthe real image, were arrested by one amongst all the green tufts which\nsurrounded me, and amongst all the fronds which composed it, by one alone,\nwhich, two yards off, had the exact appearance of a bifurcation.\nPurely appearance, I said to myself, drawing near. Simply the juxta\nposition of two neighbouring fronds, which I have so often mistaken for it.\nSceptical even while gathering it, I could not believe my eyes. But the\nevidence was undeniable, and when, much astonished but highly delighted, I\nhad plucked the fern, I said to myself half-aloud, as though uttering a\nchallenge, \" Well, I only want now to find the Cet\u2014\" I had not finished my\nsentence when my gaze, leaving the high wall on the right where it was still\nmechanically searching, fell below the footpath on the left, at the foot of the\nbuttress, on a poor sickly plant of Ceternch Officinarum (Common Scale-Fern\nor Scaly Spleenwort) crowded into the midst of the Aspleninm (Spleenworts)\nas if dejected at finding itself in this damp shady corner instead of a crevice\nin a dry and sunny wall, which is the usual abode of this species.\nAnd this plant, which ordinarily I should never have dreamed of seeking\nin such a spot, this fern of quite simple venation, edges very slightly divided,\nand under surfaces all scaly, in fact with an appearance so opposed to the idea\nof partition that (never having come across a specimen either in my youthful\nresearches, in the splendid collections of the Museum, or in any herbal or\nrare book) I had concluded it to be non-existent\u2014an impossible anomaly\u2014\nit was, I say, a frond of this fern that appeared before me to-day at my\nbidding, as in Perrault's stories, as clearly bipartite as the Asplenium close\nby had been.\nBeing at once led on, and covetously pushing my reasoning straight to the\nprincipal conclusion of my old observations on the somewhat epidemic and\nat the same time local character of these freaks of nature, I argued : \" If I\nhave found one, and even two bifurcated fronds, certainly the third is not\nfar to seek.\" And in less time than it had taken to announce this decision,\nwithout any hesitation, amongst all the attractive groups of fern, I dis\ntinguished immediately one frond of maiden-hair shewing two clearly-marked\npoints.\nI should never have made up my mind to put this incident in writing, at\nthe risk of occasioning the reader's sceptical smile, if the recurrence of the\nsame adventure twice in the course of this same year had not confirmed the\nreality and demonstrated the importance of the psychological problem.\nOn the 8th August, 1893, at Lausanne (Switzerland) I had just accom\npanied some friends returning to the country, whose gay conversation was\nanything rather than botanical, and the last good-byes were hardly said,\nwhen all at once, as I walked along the path we had taken a minute or two\nearlier, there shot into my head, without rhyme or reason, the idea of a\ndivided maiden-hair, and immediately I put my hand on a frond, then further\non on a second, and again on another, always making my choice at once\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 413\nwithout groping in the long green mantle of the great wall. Afterwards I\nin vain retraced my steps to explore conscientiously, with attention, and at\nlength, the fifty yards of pathway ; there was nothing more, or I could see\nno more.\nTen days later I was visiting near Chamb^ry with a gay and numerous\nparty the celebrated country house Charmettes, still alive with memories of\nJean Jacques Rousseau. As I crossed the threshold, the thanks of the care\ntaker still in my ears, and before my eyes the pictures of the Confessions, I\ninstinctively felt my gaze drawn towards the little wall of the terrace, where,\n) at the first glance amongst several stunted tufts, which were afterwards to\nfurnish me with several similar specimens, I discovered an extremely curious\nplant of maidenhair, such as I did not yet possess, with fronds not merely\nbifurcated, but really ramified.\nWas it this time a reminiscence of \" Lettres sur la botanique \" which had\ngiven the suggestion ? Was it not, as well as the time before, simply an echo\nat a relatively shorter distance of the exciting experience in the month of\nMay ? I do not think so, for with regard to the latter nothing of the sort\ncould be argued, and it seems, on the contrary, that it was precisely the\nabsence of all appreciable cause, the apparently complete spontaneity of the\nfirst vision, to which was due the intensity of the second\u2014a real second sight\nwhich leads infallibly straight to the mark. That mark is evidently pre-\nexistent, of a real kind, and perhaps\u2014one might defend this view !\u2014is\nitself by its simple presence, and by a sort of self-discharge at a distance,\nthe unsuspected and unperceived cause of the sudden internal revival\nof a similar image, stored-up long ago ;\u2014the spontaneous exteriorisation\nof which, and the placing of it in coincidence with the corresponding object,\nwould constitute precisely the fact of the discovery\u2014that is to say simply the\nproof of the existence\u2014of that object. Whatever may be the cause, it seems\ncertain that only the abruptness, the suddenness of the cerebral awakening\nis capable of giving momentarily to the sensorial faculties that acuteness in\nsome sort prophetic, which automatically attracts the material object of the\nmental evocation, not out of nothing, as a superstitious mind might believe,\nbut simply out of the relative obscurity in which it would have remained\nunder other circumstances.\nNo normal tension of the mind, no effort of will, no abilities exercised at\ntheir best could attain to the results of these rapid moments of temporary\nhyper-stimulation. Never, except on the three occasions I have recorded,\ni have I been able to find the abnormal Asplenium, still less the abnormal\nCeterach, although every year, sooner or later, thousands of specimens have\npassed before my eyes, amongst which I have often tried on solitary walks\nin the most varied localities, with all the concentration of attention of which\nI am capable, and the fullest use of a faculty of discovery developed by old\nnaturalistic habit, to discover the rare object, the eternal ambition of the\ncollector. I often found other things, but never that.\nIs it not the same, to make a comparison, as that which happens in a\ndream, when in preference to the subjects of long voluntary meditations\ntrivial daily incidents always crop up, which, hardly noticed at the moment,\nand apparently no sooner occurring than forgotten, have none the less by the\nunexpectedness, the lightning-like effect of their track across the daily\n2 n\n\f414 F. W. H. Myers.\nmonotony, made a more vivid if not a deeper impression on the brain than\nall the subjects of ordinary preoccupation or voluntary reflection.\nThe cerebral problem is certainly curious, and deserves, based as it here\nis on a group of precise facts, to be clearly stated at this time, when the\nscience of psychology, no longer admitting the supernatural, fears not to\nencroach at times on the domain of the marvellous, in order that it may\nrestrict more and more that of the incomprehensible.\nAdrIen GtTBBHard.\nWith regard to my above communication, in which you have been kindly\ninterested, you put the following questions to me :\u2014\n(1) Is it not possible that this discovery of abnormal ferns may have been\nan effect of unconscious sight ?\n(2) As to the fact of finding three of them in a small space, is it possible\nthat this monstrosity may be determined by certain local causes in such a\nmanner that in a very limited area many may occur, whilst for several\nhundreds of yards not one may be met with 1\nAs to the second point, I can reply at once \" Yes,\" for such was exactly\nthe conclusion I came to on my first study of this subject, confirmed by my\nlast find at Contes-les-Pins.\nThese abnormal growths are almost always in little groups, forming well-\ndefined islands as it were in the midst of normal plants, proving the external,\nlocal and non-individual character of the original causal lesion, which might\nbe due, as I think, to some micro-organism, either vegetable or animal, a\nparasite fungoid or gnawing insect.\nBut it is not at all the repetition of the discovery (which was logical and\nforeseen), which affected me so strongly as to make me forget for a minute\nthe palpable and material object ; but rather the incredibly rapid succes\nsion, I might almost say the instantaneous co-incidence, of the apparition\nof each mental image and its objective realisation.\nWhen one gives oneself up to any search whatever, even with the\ngreat amount of practice and the good sight which I have, there is always a\ntime of visual groping like the tactile fumbling of the hand which seeks a\nneedle in a bottle of hay.\nThe time lost in hunting about is longer in proportion, as the object\nsought is less common and less distinct from the mass of its surroundings.\nAnd what more like a frond of double fern than two fronds, one lying\nacross the other ?\nIn vain ordinarily I might have exercised my keen sight on the\nfirst part of the wall, as I did on the after part, as I have done hundreds of\ntimes for years ; it is very probable I should have found nothing\u2014since it\nis also very probable that there was nothing.\nHow did it happen that it was just where there was something that my\nattention was aroused ? How, too, did my eye go so quickly and directly to\nthe point, passing from right to left, from high to low at once, with such\ncertainty ?\nIs it by a sort of attraction, which the real object has for the mental\nimage, previously itself evoked from its latent state by the near neighbour\nhood of the reality which it expresses ?\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 415\nHere is a question which I had already put in the course of my first\nstudy of the subject, and which you repeat more definitely, in your first\nquestion concerning unconscious sight. ^ q\nCompare with this the following recent incident which occurred to\nDr. Hodgson shortly after he had been reading the above account.\nP. 256. Leckhampton House, Cambridge.\nl September Uth, 1895.\nYesterday morning (September 13th, 1895), just after breakfast, I was\nstrolling alone along one of the garden paths of Leckhampton House,\nrepeating aloud to myself the verses of a poem. I became temporarily\noblivious to my garden surroundings, and regained my consciousness of\nthem suddenly to find myself brought to a stand, in a stooping position,\ngazing intently at a five-leaved clover. On careful examination I found\nabout a dozen specimens of five-leaved clover as well as several specimens of\nfour-leaved clover, all of which probably came from the same root. Several\nyears ago I was interested in getting extra-leaved clovers, but I have not for\nyears made any active search for them, though occasionally my conscious\nattention, as I walked along, has been given to appearances of four-leaved\nclover which proved on examination to be deceptive. The peculiarity of\nyesterday's \" find\" was that I discovered myself, with a sort of shock,\nstanding still and stooping down, and afterwards realised that a five-leaved\nclover was directly under my eyes. I plucked some of the specimens, and\nshowed them at once to Mr. and Mrs. Myers, and explained how I had\nhappened to find them. Clover plants were thickly clustered in the neigh\nbourhood, but I failed on looking to find any other specimens. The incident\nnaturally suggests the arresting of my subliminal attention.\nR. Hodgson.\nTurning to the sense of hearing, we have several cases where an\nintimation which the percipient regarded as supernormal may have\ndepended on subconscious interpretation of a slight sound. For\ninstance ;\u2014 two friends walking together along a street in a storm\njust evade by sudden movements a falling mass of masonry. Each\n* thinks that he has received some monition of the fall ;\u2014 each asserting\nthat he heard no noise whatever to warn him. Here is an instance\nwhere subliminal perception may have been slightly quicker and\nmore delicate than supraliminal;\u2014and may have warned them just\nin time.\nIn the next case1 there may have been some subliminal hyperes\nthesia of hearing which dimly warned Mr. Wyman of the approach of\nthe extra train.\n1 For a somewhat similar case, possibly due to hyperesthesia of hearing, see\nAmerican Journal of Psychology, Vol. III., p. 435 (September, 1890).\n2 h 2\n\f416 F. W. H. Myers.\nP. 166.\nMr. Wm. EL Wyman writes to the Editor of the Arena from\nDunkirk, N.Y., June 26tt, 1891.\nSome years ago my brother was employed and had charge as conductor\nand engineer of a working train on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern\nRailway, running between Buffalo and Erie, which passes through this city\n(Dunkirk, N.Y.). I often went with him to the Grave Bank, where he had\nhis headquarters, and returned on his train with him. On one occasion I\nwas with him, and after the train of cars was loaded, we went together to\nthe telegraph office to see if there were any orders and to find out if the trains\nwere on time, as he had to keep out of the way of all regular trains. After\nlooking over the train reports and finding them all on time, we started for\nBuffalo. As we approached near Westfield Station, running about 12 miles\nper hour, and when within about one mile of a long curve in the line, my\nbrother all of a sudden shut off the steam, and quickly stepping over to the\nfireman's side of the engine, he looked out of the cab window, and then to\nthe rear of his train to see if there was anything the matter with either. Not\ndiscovering anything wrong, he stopped and put -on steam, but almost imme\ndiately again shut it off and gave the signal for breaks and stopped. After\ninspecting the engine and train and finding nothing wrong, he seemed very\nmuch excited, and for a short time he acted as if he did not know where he\nwas or what to do. I asked what was the matter. He replied that he did\nnot know, when, after looking at his watch and orders, he said that he felt\nthat there was some trouble on the line of the road. I suggested that he had\nbetter run his train to the station and find out. He then ordered his flagman\nwith his flag to go ahead around the curve, which was just ahead of us, and\nhe would follow with the train. The flagman started and had just time to\nflag an extra express train, with the General Superintendent and others on\nboard, coming full 40 [forty] miles per hour. The Superintendent enquired\nwhat he was doing there, and if he did not receive orders to keep out of the\nway of the extra. My brother told him that he had not received orders and\ndid not know of any extra train coming ; that we had both examined the\ntrain reports before leaving the station. The train then backed to the station\nwhere it was found that no orders had been given. The train dispatcher was\nat once discharged from the road, and from that time to this both my brother\nand myself are unable to account for his stopping the train as he did. I\nconsider it quite a mystery, and cannot give or find any intelligent reason\nfor it. Can you suggest any ?\nThe above is true and correct in every particular.\nIn subsequent letters to Dr. Hodgson Mr. Wyman writes :\u2014\nMy brother died some three years ago.\nThe incident occurred about the year 1873.\nI was not connected with the road or train at the time ; I was employed\non the New York, Lake Erie, and Western R. R., at Dunkirk. The flag\nman is now, or was a short time ago, living in Denver, Colorado ; his state\nment can be obtained if desirable.\nThe Superintendent died in Germany about two years ago.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 417\nIn a subsequent letter Mr. Wyman adds :\u2014I traced Mr. James Conway,\n[the flagman], to Colorado, and learned from his son that he died March 16th,\n1888. [Letter sent herewith.]\nMrs. D. Wyman, widow of the percipient, writes :\u2014\nJersey City, September 16th, 1893.\nMr. Hodgson,\u2014Sir,\u2014I received your letter asking me for statements in\nregard to Mr. Wyman's experience. I don't think I could tell any of the\ncircumstances, I only recollect hearing him say he was singularly and deeply\nimpressed that something was wrong, and he obeyed the impulse and stopped\nthe train just in season of time to prevent an accident, and it left a deep\nimpression on his mind ever after, as he often spoke of it and wondered why\nand what it was.\u2014Yours respectfully,\nL. A. Wyman.\nTaking next the sense of rmell, we have elsewhere printed several\ncases where monitions taking various forms have summoned the per\ncipients to an incipient conflagration of which they felt sure that no\nordinary sensation could have warned them. There may often,\nhowever, as in the next case, be some doubt whether some slight odour\nmay not have given a subliminal hint.\nP. 162. Oro Blanco, Arizona,\nMarch 7th, 1894.\nDr. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I give you herewith account of an\noccurrence about two years ago. ... At the time I was at a mine\ncalled Rosales, about twenty miles east of Carlo, Sonora, Mexico. I had\nwith me my assistant, and two other Americans. A Mexican family\noccupied the building where we made our headquarters. The corral, or\nenclosure for the horses of the party, was about 60 yards from the house,\nand was fenced with posts and brushwood, with one entrauce. There were\nno other houses within 200 yards.\nWe had been quite busy examining ore samples in the house, and finally,\nlate in the afternoon, to get a breath of fresh air and rest a little, I went to\nthe outside door and leaned up against the door frame lazily, thinking of\nnothing in particular. The rest of our party were inside, busy with assay\nsamples. None of the Mexicans were in sight.\nA voice, more to my inner hearing than outward, but to me perfectly\naudible, said, \"Go to the corral!\" Now, if there is anything I am not\nlikely to do on a trip, it is to have anything to do with the care of the\nhorses or corral.\nI looked toward the corral, saw nothing out of the way, and answered\nthe voice, perhaps not audibly, \"What should I go to the corral for?\"\nand kept my position. In a few seconds it came again, \" Go to the corral ! '\nquite peremptonly. I went. I stepped quickly inside the corral (first time\nI had been there). The ground was covered with several inches of dry grass\nand hay, old fodder, etc., which, near one side, was on tire. I gave the\nalarm, and by quick work we saved the corral and horses.\n\f418 F. W. U. Myers.\nBefore I got inside the corral, I had neither seen nor smelt smoke, and\nhad not the slightest idea of anything wrong. None of our party or of the\nMexicans knew anything of what was going on till I gave the alarm.\nC. W. Kempton. [Associate S.P.R.]\n(In answer to an enquiry dated March 16th, 1894, Mr. Kempton\nwrote : )\nThe date was p.m. of May 5th, 1892. I was using my professional\nnotebook that day, and made no record of this occurrence in it.\nC. W. Kempton.\nI was Mr. Kempton's assistant on the trip to Rosales Mine in May, 1892,\nand remember his finding the fire in the corral. I do not remember if he\nsaid anything to me about a voice warning him, at the time. 1 have a faint\nidea that he did so.\nEdward E. Noon.\nOro Blanco, April 2nd, 1894.\nWith this case, however, it is only fair to compare the following,\nwhere the sense of smell can scarcely be supposed to have played a\npart, although subliminal liearing may have operated in the first of the\ntwo cases.\nP. 134. Monition.\nFrom a lady known to F. W. H. M., received June 3rd, 1890.\nIn the summer of 1888, I was living in the little mining camp of R ,\nin the Rocky Mountains. Our house, a frame building, was some little\ndistance from any other, at the top of a steep hill ; the only disadvantage of\nthis being the additional difficulty of getting water, which was an expensive\ncommodity in R as the adjacent mines had drained most of the wells,\nand we had either to carry it a long way, or buy it in barrels at 50 cents,\neach.\nThe house contained six rooms, all opening one out of another, my own\nroom, with a dressing closet beyond, where my child slept, being at one\nextremity, and the front porch, which overlooked the valley, at the other.\nOne evening, after my little girl was asleep, I lit a tiny night-lamp,\nalways left burning on a bracket in her room ; and, leaving all doors and\nwindows open, on account of the intense heat, went to sit in the front porch.\nI may have sat there half an hour, when my attention was caught by a great\nblazing light in the direction of the furthest houses. It appeared evident\nthat one at least had taken fire, and the difficulty of getting water, and the\nhope that no children were in danger, flashed through my mind. While\nwatching the rapidly growing glare, I heard a faint crackling sound in my\nown house. It would not have disturbed me at any other time, as I only\nsupposed that some smouldering piece of cedar in the kitchen stove had\nblazed up. But, with the present thought of fire in my mind I went into\nthe kitchen to look, and, glancing through the open doors as I passed saw a\nvolume of flame and smoke pouring from the child's room into mine. Thank\nGod, it was still possible to rush through and save her, and I carried her\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 419\nback in a blanket to prevent the scorch, for the ruom was only burning at\none end ; the side where the bed stood, though fearfully hot and suffocating,\nwas not yet on fire, and, thanks to the timely warning, the water left in the\nbarrels proved just enough to extinguish the flames before very much was\ndestroyed, though they were making headway terribly fast on the dry lumber.\nAfter all was quiet I went back to the porch to look at that other burning\nhouse, feeling so thankful that my child was safe, and wondering anxiously\nif others were also. But all was dark, ami when I came to make inquiry\nnext day, nothing was known in R of any such fire. And had it not\nbeen for my strange vision of it, which must have lasted fully 10 minutes, I\nfeel sure that my little girl would have been burned to death.\nOn the night of May 21st, 1890, I was staying at F , in England. I\nalways burned a nightlight in the bedroom I shared with my little girl. It\nstood in a saucer of water upon a wooden corner bracket, and I had never\nhad any accident with it. At about a quarter to two I was waked suddenly,\nand very much startled by hearing myself called not only the impression\nbut the actual sound of the voice ringing in my ears as I jumped up in bed.\nThe name called was an abbreviation of my own, not used by anyone in\nEngland. When I found that all was quiet in the house, I lay down think\ning how strange it was that this particular form of my name, which I had\nnot heard for many months, should have been used. Half a minute later,\nnot only the paper case, but the grease, of which at that hour my nightlight\nwas full, caught fire, making a blaze which threatened the bracket, and\nmight have set fire to the wall also, but that, thanks to having been waked,\nI was able to jump out of bed, and extinguish it directly.\nHere, again, is an averted railway accident, where smell may\npossibly have played some part.\nP. 213.\nThe following letter was received by Dr. Hodgson in confirmation of an\naccount in a newspaper, concordant with Mr. Stewart's account given later.\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad Company,\nAugust Uth, 1893, Garrett, Ind\nYours of August 10th received. Must say, the story as printed in many\nof the newspapers of our country, regarding the train being saved by a pre\nmonition, or warning, given me, was true as printed. The fireman I then\nhad, since became an engineer, and was killed in an accident on a railroad in\nIowa two years since. The conductor who was with me at the time you refer\nto is running passenger train on the Mackinaw road. I do not know his\naddress, but his father, a minister of the gospel, and his brother, Dr. Charles\nStewart, are residents of this city. A letter addressed to Mr. Joseph Stewart,\ncare of Dr. Charles Stewart, Garrett, Ind. , would reach my conductor.\nYes, sir, I have had an experience of similar nature since the occurrence\nyou refer to. Had a warning from the same source, and by obeying it I\nsaved what otherwise, without obeying the warning, must have been a most\ndreadful accident, and must have resulted in the entire destruction of my\ntrain, with the lives of many, if not all the persons on board. I am not a\n\f420 F. W. H. Myers.\nSpiritualist, do not believe in so-called Spiritualism, but do believe that the\nliving are often visited, often warned of danger, and often comforted in times\nof affliction by the spirits of departed loved ones. I do not know how far\naway the spirit world is from this, but I know that the spirits of departed\nloved ones are often very near to me.\nIt may be in the near future I may relate to you the later experiences I\nhave had in similar things, living witnesses to which still live in this city.\nIn regard to the privacy of my name, I care not, as I am not ashamed of it\nbeing seen any place that I put it. q w Moses.\nBattle Creek, Mich., August 28th, 1893.\nRichard Hodgson, Esq.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014Your request received, and will,\nas far as memory serves, give a correct statement as to the incident referred to.\nTrain No. 2 of the B. and O. RR., due in Chicago at 6.20 a.m., Sunday, in\nthe month of August, 1883 (have forgotten exact date), was on time, running\nat about 35 miles an hour. On approaching Salt Creek Trestle Work, about\n40 miles east of Chicago, the engineer, Mr. C. W. Moses, felt that something\nthat he could not define compelled him to stop before attempting to cross\nover. He applied the air and came to a full stop at the approach. I occu\npied front seat in smoker, it being the second car from engine. The time\nwas about 4.30 a.m.\nI immediately went forward and joined the engineer, where we found 30\nfeet of the woodwork burned, the rails being held to place by charred\nstringers. We went across, by climbing down and up the bank on the other\nside, and woke up the watchman who was employed to look after the bridge,\nwho, on seeing us and the condition of things in general, took to his heels\nand is running still, as far as I know.\nI would say that in more than a score of years engaged in railroad work,\nthat was the most narrow escape I ever experienced ; for undoubtedly, with\na fall of thirty feet and the length of over a hundred, we would not only have\nbeen disabled, but burned.\nNow, you especially ask as to what impelled Mr. Moses in his action.\nHe only stated to me at the time that something especially pressing on him\ntold him he should stop, and he acted on the impulse. There had been fires\nall along the side of track at other points, but he paid no attention to them.\nIn conclusion, I see some newspaper man got hold of the incident as late\nas last June, and attempted to make Mr. Moses say that the spirit of a sainted\nmother took hold of him. Well, Mr. Moses is an upright and truthful, old,\nreliable engineer, and owing to his great advance in years at this late date\nmay have intimated as much, but nothing was said about the old lady at the\ntime ; that I vouch for.\nBelieving this a sufficient reply, will close. Should you wish anything\nmore specific, I am at your service.\u2014Respectfully,\nI. J. Stewart, Conductor C. J. and M. R. R.\n[Formerly of the B. and O. R. R.]\nIn the following case again some subliminal sense of smell may be\nconjectured.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 421\nV. 219.\nFifteen or sixteen years have elapsed since I had the following clair\nvoyant experience, but at the time I was much struck by it, and described\nit minutely to several of my friends, so that I feel sure I can remember\nthe facts accurately. The circumstances were most prosaic, and I, a\nmatter-of-fact individual, with little interest and less faith in psychical\nphenomena. I was about eighteen years of age, at home for my winter\nholiday, but taking no interest in household matters, and I question\nwhether on that particular evening I knew that it had been the washing-\nV day.\nI had gone upstairs to look for a missing knitting needle, and was\nreturning to the parlour wondering whether I had dropped it there, when\nsuddenly I was arrested by a strange feeling, and saw before me a vision of\nflames, and felt irresistibly impelled to go through a door at the end of the\npassage and down some steps into the kitchen. There all was quiet, and I\ncame partially out of the trance-like state, and found myself thinking\n\" Why am I here ? I'll go upstairs.\" But again I saw the fire, and felt I\nmust go into the adjoining laundry. On opening the door, I was in no way\nsurprised to see just such a scene as had during the preceding moments been\ndistinctly before my mental vision. A jointed gas bracket had just fallen\non to a heap of dry sheets and towels, which were blazing almost to the\nceiling. With a little difficulty I extinguished the flames, and went to tell\nthe rest of the household what had occurred. I remember I had a strange\nfeeling in my head, as if I had just awaked out of an unnatural state.\nNo other person was near at the time, the washerwoman having gone\nhome, and the servants being upstairs. Nor could I even unconsciously\nhave smelled burning, as two doors were closed between, and the gas-pipe\nhad evidently fallen only a few moments before I entered, or the flames\nwould have spread further. The laundry was situated just under a wooden\nstaircase in the middle of a very dry house, so if the fire had been\nundiscovered for even a few minutes, the consequences must have been\ndisastrous to the house.\nSeveral members of the family remember the occurrence, and I have\nstill an old servant of the family who distinctly remembers it. I have\nnever had any recurrence of such a phenomenon, and was at the time much\nsurprised that I should have been the subject of an experience so strange\nand so real.\nM. H. Gkay.\nAfarch 31st 1893 Andrew's Drive, Pollockshields, Glasgow.\nThe gentleman who sends this case writes that he has received orally\nthe confirmatory testimony of Jessie, the old servant, and encloses the\ncorroboratory statement of Mrs. Elizabeth White, stepmother of the per\ncipient.\nMrs. Elizabeth White does not remember that she was told at the time,\nof the Jirt part of the vision. She writes :\u2014\nMy daughter, at home from school, not naturally domesticated, seldom\nwent near the kitchen\u2014which was shut off from the hall by a swing-door.\nOn the night above mentioned, she came into the parlour looking so pale\n\f422 F. W. H. Myers.\nand agitated\u2014being naturally nervous\u2014that I at once asked what was the\nmatter, and when she could speak, she said, \" Mamma, it is a wonder the\nhouse was not on fire,\" and then told of having the strong impression that\nshe must go down to the laundry, that there was fire. She had to go\nthrough two closed doors to get there, and was not aware that no one was\nin the laundry at the time. Her promptitude in stamping out the fire of\nthe burning sheets no doubt saved the house, and accounted for her pallid\nlook on returning to the parlour. This occurred about fifteen years ago.\nIn the next case some warning may have been received from the\ncloser smell of slimy water ;\u2014or perhaps from a vague difference in the\nlook of the darkness, or even in the resistance of the air.\nDr. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I send you an account of an incident in\nwhich, I think, my life was saved by my obedience to an impulse arising\nfrom nothing within my conscious knowledge or perception.\nSome years ago, I landed in Stillwater, Minn., from a steamboat on\nwhich I had come down the St. Croix river. The boat was a small, local\naffair, and no conveyances came to meet it. I was, I believe, the only \u00a3\npassenger on board when we reached Stillwater, and there I was left to\nmake my way alone to the hotel. We landed at about 9 f.m. of a starless\nnight, and in the shadow of a warehouse which cut off the lights of the town ;\nthe hour, the clouded sky, and the shadow of the warehouse, uniting to\nmake the dock extremely dark.\nI had been in Stillwater once before, and had a general idea of the\ntopography of the town, although some years had passed since my previous\nvisit, and I am quite certain that I had never passed over this particular\nlocality.\nAs I left the boat I saw the lights of the bridge at some distance on my\nleft, and knowing the bridge to be at the foot of the principal street, on\nwhich stood the hotel where I intended to put up, I naturally commenced to\nwalk along the dock in that direction. I had gone but a very short distance,\nwhen I suddenly felt so strong an impulse to turn and go the other way that\nI instantly obeyed. I saw nothing, heard nothing ; I did not even have an\nimpression of danger, though I did have a feeling that it must be in some\nway better to turn.\nI distinctly remember that my reason protested, and berated me for a\nfool in taking a roundabout way to my destination when the straight way lay\nbefore me, with the added prospect of losing myself in the railway yards,\nwith perhaps a ten-foot fence to climb. I laughed aloud, and articulated, or\nat least, mentally formed the words, \" You fool ! What are you doing this\nfor t \" However, my impulse proved stronger than my reason. I persisted\nin \"going round Robin Hood's barn,\" reached my hotel, and there the\nmatter passed from my mind.\nP. 177. 5,144, Madison Avenue, Hyde Park,\nChicago, October 30th, 1892.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 423\nThe next day I casually came to the same place, and discovered that I\nhad turned within a few feet of a spot where the dock was cut away into an\nincline for hauling freight up into the warehouse. This incline was so steep\nthat a person could have kept his footing on it only by great care. If I had\nunexpectedly stepped down on to it in the darkness, I should certainly have\nlost my footing, and should have slipped into the river ; and as I am but a\nfeeble swimmer under the most favourable circumstances, and was encum\nbered with a fall overcoat and a rather heavy satchel, I should just as\ncertainly have been drowned.\nThe value of the incident lies in the fact for which you must take my\nword, that I am not an impulsive and changeable person, but rather logical\nand persistent. My action was entirely contrary to my nature, and the\nunavailing protest of my reason against what appeared to me an inconsequent\nand absurd proceeding convinces me either that I was influenced by some\nintelligence entirely without, or that my \"Subliminal Self\" perceived and\nacted upon what my \" Supraliminal Self \" could not see.\nI have never had any other supernormal experiences.\nMarshall Watt.\nTactile sensibility, again, must be carefully allowed for. The sense\nof varying resistance in the air, to which I just now alluded, may reach\nin some seeing persons, as well as in the blind, a high degree of acute-\nness. It is perhaps possible that even the interposition of a chair in a\nnarrow passage might thus make itself felt. But Mr. W. (a good\nwitness and well known to Dr. Hodgson) has had other experiences\nwhere supernormal influences seemed plainly indicated. (Vol. VIII.,\np. 242.)\nP. 159. State of New York, December 28th, 1893.\nDe. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014In compliance with your request to write\nout an account of my chair experience, which I described to you when here,\nI submit the following :\u2014\nMy office consists of three rooms, and the library in the back one is\nreached by passing through the full length of the other two. The middle\nroom is rather narrow, and well filled on both sides with furniture, leaving a\nrather narrow passage through the room lengthwise, particularly at a point\nabout the middle of the room, where the passage is only three feet wide.\nThis passage was very naturally kept free from obstructions, but on the\noccasion of which I am about to speak, some one, probably the janitor when\nhe came in to see to the fires soon after the office was closed for the day, had\nplaced a chair in this narrow passage, so that any one who should attempt to\npass through the room would be certain to fall over it, if dark. I think it\nwas about the last days of December, 1892. I recollect the days were very\nshort. I had left the office for the day with the passage free. I visit the office\noccasionally evenings, but not often. On this occasion during the evening,\nwhen it was very dark, I visited the office alone. 1 unlocked the outside\ndoor, walked through the first room, stopping at the door that leads to the\nsecond or middle room, to get a match from the safe hanging on the door\n\f424 F. W. H. Myers.\ncasing with which to light a lamp in the library, where I wished to get some\nthing. I was in a very great hurry, and walked very rapidly ; after taking\nthe match from the safe, I started at a very rapid pace to go through this\nnarrow passage and into the library It was very dark, none of the objects\nin the room were visible, but as I was very familiar with the place, I did not\nhesitate. I had proceeded six or eight feet in this rapid manner, when\nsuddenly I saw a bright, yellow light lighting up very plainly the back of the\nchair which was in the passage. The light was confined to the chair, and at\nthe same time I stopped short. The stopping was quite involuntary on my\npart. The light lasted for but a second, but it had shown me the chair\ndistinctly, especially the carving on the back of the chair.\nImmediately it occurred to me to discover the origin of the light, if\npossible, so, before proceeding to get a light or to leave the room, I approached\nthe chair again in a similar manner, but no light appeared, and I experienced\nno check. I also looked very carefully for the origin of the light, but could\ndiscover none. There was no light anywhere near, and even had there been,\nI am at a loss to see how it could have shone into the centre of this room,\nand the difficulty is still further increased by the fact that it shone only in\none place, and even there the light was of a somewhat different colour and\nappearance from ordinary artificial light.\nAfter satisfying myself that there was no light anywhere that could have\nproduced it, I went into the library and got a lamp and made an examination.\nThe chair was in the passage in the most dangerous part ; otherwise the\nroom was in its usual condition. I should also state that at one end of this\nroom there was a coal stove, with a fire in it of hard coal. It was burning\nvery low, and was ashed over. I examined it before I got a lamp, and I am\nconfident that no light of any kind proceeded from it.\nAs to my sudden stop. The stop and the light were simultaneous. I\nhardly think the light unaided caused me to stop ; it undoubtedly prevented\nme from starting after I had stopped. I fully believe I should have sustained\na heavy fall, but for the light and the stop. ^\nP.S.\u2014When I mention that the colour of the light appeared different, I\nmean that it did not look as a light reflected from or shining from a distance\non to a spot would\u2014it was more like looking directly at a light.\nHere is a monition for which it is not easy to suggest any\nhyperesthetic origin.\nP. 258 (A BIO.)\nBoston Transcript, August 17th, 1894.\nTo the Editor of the Transcript :\u2014The following incident may interest\nsome of the readers of the Transcript. A few weeks ago I had occasion to\nrequire the services of a dentist, and when I went to his office at the time\nappointed I found him in a very excited state of mind, caused, he told me,\nby a very strange occurrence. The office is a pleasant room facing the\nCommon on Tremont-street, and in one corner, the farthest from the windows,\nthe dentist had a small work-bench, partitioned off from the rest of the room,\nand there he had his copper vessel which he used when vulcanising the rubber\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 425\nfor the setting of false teeth. He had been working at a set of teeth, and\nwas bending over the bench on which was the copper containing the rubber,\nwhen he heard a voice calling in a quick and imperative manner these words :\n\" Run to the window, quick ! \" \" Run to the window, quick ! \" twice repeated.\nWithout thinking from whom the voice could have come, he at once ran to\nthe window and looked out to the street below, when suddenly he heard a\ntremendous report in his workroom, and looking round he saw the copper\nvessel had exploded, and had been blown up through the plastering of the\nroom. He went into the workshop and found things in a most confused\ni condition, the bench of two inches thickness was broken downwards by the\nconcussion, and everything in the room showed marks of the violence of the\nexplosion. The neighbouring tenants came rushing into the room to ascer\ntain the cause of the loud report, and they were surprised at the dentist's\naccount of the transaction. As he was alone in the room at the time of the\naccident, he is mystified at the warning that he received so opportunely.\nThe copper vessel had a safety valve which was supposed to open\nautomatically at a certain degree of pressure, but it appeared on investiga\ntion after the explosion that it had become useless by reason of foulness,\ntherefore it did not work. These are the simple facts in the case, as told me\nby the young man, but I cannot verify them except by stating that the\nappearance of the room and the workshop substantiated his account. The\ncopper vulcaniser weighed about ten pounds and was imbedded in the ceiling,\nfor there was a pressure of about eighty pounds to the square inch at\nthe time of the explosion. There is little doubt that the dentist was saved\nfrom being wounded, or perhaps killed, by the friendly warning, and it is\ncertainly a very interesting incident.\nC. Hazen Brown.\nBox 1813, Boston, August 16lh, 1894.\nBoston, Mass., November 15th, 1894.\nMr. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir, \u2014Mr. C. Hazen Brown informs me that he\nreceived a letter from you, relative to the warning that was given before the\nexplosion at my office, requesting the name of the dentist\u2014or card. Please\nfind card, and\nI remain, yours respectfully,\nO. P. Smith, D.M.D.\n150, Tremont-street, Room 6.\nBoston, Mass., December 1st, 1894\nMr. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014Your communication of November 15th\nwas received. I have been so engaged that I have not had opportunity to\nattend to that matter.\nI should be pleased to have you call at my office on the 5th of the present\nmonth, at 9.30 o'clock a.m., and will explain to you the use of the vulcaniser\nand talk with you in regard to the explosion.\u2014Yours respectfully,\nO. F. Smith, D.M.D.\nI called on December 5th and saw Dr. Smith, a coloured gentleman.\nIntelligent witness. His only experience. Did not recognise the voice.\nThe marks of the explosion were still in the room. He confirmed the\naccount of Mr. Brown (known to me).\u2014R.H.\n\f426 F. W. H. Myers.\nFrom these cases of possible hyperesthesia of the external senses\nwe may make our transition to a phenomenon of what may be termed\ncentral hyperesthesia, a heightening of inner sensations to a point\nwhere the future history of the organism can be guessed or divined with\nunusual distinctness. This is virtually but another aspect of the\nknowledge of intimate processes which self-suggestion has so often\nshown. If the subliminal self can induce or arrest changes in the\norganism, it may well be able also to foresee such changes when they\nare approaching through natural causes. In whatever direction we\nhave seen suggestion operate, in that direction may we expect to see\norganic prediction operate also. Thus, for instance, suggestion has\nproduced fainting, and also bleeding at the nose. We need not, then,\nbe surprised if we find, as already printed, Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\np. 339, a warning of a fainting-fit conveyed to Lady Eardley, or, as\nin the following case (unfortunately of remote date), a warning of\ndangerous nose-bleeding.\nP. 133. Monition. Auditory.\nCommunicated by Mr. D. Fraser Harris, B.Sc., Lond., who is acquainted\nwith the percipient, Mrs. Edwards. Mr. Fraser Harris says :\u2014\nMrs. Edwards is a widow lady, and an American, but of English\nextraction ; she describes herself as being not imaginative, not credulous,\nnot eccentric, not hysterical, and is not of a neurotic constitution.\nThis occurred in the year 1845. Mrs. E. was in good health, and had, at\nthis time, had none of the before-mentioned fevers, which came on between\nthe ages of 30 and 50.\nMrs. E. had slept well, and was in the act of getting up, when, apparently,\nthe quiet was broken in upon by an announcement being made as though\nsome one had come in at the bedroom door and said, in a loud voice, these\nwords : \"To-day, at six o'clock, you will die.\" There was nothing more, but\nthese words seemed to resound throughout the room.\nMrs. E. resolved to tell no one of the announcement, and also not to\nbrood over it, if possible, at all. To accomplish this she went, in the course\nof the afternoon, to the house of a married sister of hers, where there would\nbe sure to be something more or less stirring going on.\nThis had the effect of distracting her attention from the certainly very\ndistressing prophecy, and Mrs. E. had the benefit of her sister's society till\nsix o'clock began to be struck by the clock. As it commenced sounding\nMrs. E. said to herself, \"There now, it's six o'clock already, and nothing has\nhappened : \" but the statement was premature, for before the chime ceased\nblood was gushing out of both nostrils in a copious stream. The alarm\nwas raised, and the whole household flocked round and applied the usual\nremedies of cold keys, &c., but quite without success. This profuse and\nalarming hemorrhage did not cease till bucketfuls of cold water were\npoured on the head and down the spine. When the doctor arrived he\nsaid a very large quantity of blood had been lost, and life only just saved\nand no more.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 427\nAs might be well expected, Mrs. E. was very weak for days after this\noccurrence. Though this was the first in point of time of the more important\nhallucinations of Mrs. E.'s life, it is, in certain respects, quite the most\nextraordinary by reason of the striking sequel to and almost complete fulfi -\nment of the prophecy. D. F. H.\nMrs. Edwards adds :\u2014\nI certify that this report is correct. I8aBella S. Edwards.\nMrs. Edwards' sister, Mrs. Coleman, at whose house the hemorrhage\noccurred, writes corroborating her sister's account. It is important to note\nthat the premonition, though not mentioned to any one, was in a sense acted\nupon by the percipient.\nIt may be objected that in these cases there was more than a mere\nforeknowledge, \u2014there was a communication of the warning as though\nby an external voice. But these externalised voices have been observed\nin cases of self-suggestion also,\u2014as in the often-quoted case of \"Leonie.\"\nThe following narrative, from the article by Dr. Parsons already quoted,\nadds an interesting variety, where the influence of opium seems not\nonly to have developed a monitory hallucination, but to have added\nforce to the self-suggestion involved.\nP. 250. From Tfie Medical Brief. May, 1891.\nSixteen years ago, I was a little sick ; took half a grain of opium, and lay\ndown upon the bed. Soon as I began to feel the tranquilising effect of the\nopium, I saw three men approaching me ; the one in front said : \" You smoke\ntoo much tobacco.\" I replied: \"I know I do.\" He then said: \"Why\ndon't you quit it ?\" I answered by saying : \" I have been thinking about it,\nbut I am afraid I can't.\" He extended his right arm, and, placing his fore\nfinger very near my face, gave it a few very significant shakes, said, in a very\nimpressive and emphatic manner : \" You will never want to use tobacco any\nmore as long as you live.\" He continued, by saying : \"You swear sometimes. ''\nI answered : \"Yes.\" He said : \" Will you promise to quit?\" I intended\nto say yes, but just as I was about to utter the word yes, instantly a change\ncame over me, and I felt like I had been held under some unknown influence,\nwhich was suddenly withdrawn or exhausted. I had been a constant\nsmoker for more than twenty years.\nSince the occurrence of the above incident, I have not touched tobacco ;\nhave felt ever since like it would poison me, and I now feel like one draw at\nthe pipe would kill me instantly. My desire for tobacco was suddenly and\neffectually torn out by the roots, but perhaps I shall never know just how\nwas done. D. J. Parsons, M. D.\nSweet Springs, Mo.\nEven when the crisis predicted is death itself, we may still in some\ncases suppose that the subliminal self has but drawn an inference\nfrom its perception of a disease likely to be soon fatal. Thus in the\n\f428 F. W. H. Myers.\nfollowing case heart-disease may have been far advanced, unknown\nto Mr. Pratt's waking self.\nP. 156.\nThe following paragraph was sent to Dr. Hodgson from some unknown\nnewspaper :\u2014\nSees Himself Dead in a Dkeam.\nThomas Pratt Dies at Valparaiso After Having a RemarliaUe Vision.\nValparaiso, Ind., January 13tfi, [1894].\nSpecial Telegram.\nThomas Pratt, an old resident of this city, was found dead in his bed this\nmorning. He was born in 1823 at Cleveland, Ohio, and was a veteran of\nthe civil war.\nPratt's store on College Hill has long been the meeting place of a half-\ndozen friends and old-time comrades of the proprietor. Last night when his\nfriends came in, Mr. Pratt told a dream he had had the night previous. He\nhad dreamed that he was dead, yet he possessed the peculiar power of one in\na trance\u2014to see all that went on about him though he was unable to move or\nspeak. He had noted the preparations for his burial, and he even named the\nhalf-dozen friends who served as pallbearers. He also told of the funeral\nservices being held in the Memorial Hall, and of his ride to the cemetery,\nand the lowering of his coffin into the grave. And when the first dirt was\nthrown upon the box he awoke from the trance and called to his comrades,\nand they drew him from the grave. The pallbearers of the dream will be\nthe pallbearers at his burial, Monday, which will be from the new Memorial\nHall.\nJanuary 15th, [1894].\nDr. Hodgson applied to the postmaster at Valparaiso and received the\nfollowing reply :\u2014\nValparaiso, Ind., January 26th, 1894.\nMr. Pratt told his dream the day after it occurred and the day before he\ndied, to John C. Flint, George Herrington, W. S. Flint, and Albert Amos\nand others. They would give you truthful statements in regard to it.\nMark L. Dickovbr, Assistant Postmaster.\nIn a subsequent letter Mr. Dickover says that a doctor, arriving shortly\nafter Mr. Pratt's death, ascribed it to heart-disease.\nFurther inquiries elicited the two letters which follow :\u2014\nValparaiso, Ind., February Hh, 1894.\nRichard Hodgson,\u2014 My Dear Sir,\u2014Your communication of the 29th\nult., asking information of the dream which Thomas Pratt had concerning\nhis death, has been received.\nOn the night previous to the night on which he died, he said he dreamed\nthat he died at twelve o'clock.\nDuring the dream he selected the pallbearers, and seemed to be con\nscious of all proceedings of his funeral, until dirt was thrown on the coffin,\nwhich suddenly aroused him.\nWilliam S. Flint.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 429\nValparaiso, Ind., Fehnuiry 2nd, 1894.\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of the 29th received. As regards Mr. Thomas Pratt's\ndream of January 11th : Mr. Pratt was a merchant here. I went in the\nstore in the morning of the 12th January. He related to me the circum\nstance of his dream. He said that he died last night. I said, \" Well,\nyou are alive yet. \" Then he told me about his dream. He said that he\ndreamt that he died and chose his pallbearers, and was taken to the\ngrave, and then lowered down. When they began to put the dirt on\nthe coffin he woke up. When I went down the next morning he was\n1 dead. He died 3 a.m., on the 13th of January. The same pallbearers\nofficiated him to the grave.\nI was the first one that he related his dream to. He laughed at it the\nsame day that he died, and said that he was good for forty years longer.\nWhen he died he was 71 years old.\nGeorge Herrington.\nCompare the case of Christopher Brooks, quoted by Mrs. Sidgwick,\nProceedings, Vol. V.f p. 291. The doctor there could find nothing\namiss ; yet must we not suppose that some heart-disease already\nexisted when the premonition came? At any rate the death\nof a healthy and contented young man, at a predetermined day\nand hour, merely on account of an impression received in a dream,\u2014\nthis would be a result going far beyond any efficacy with which mere\nunsupported suggestion has hitherto been credited.\nCompare the following case, where a child, while apparently quite\nwell, feels the impression of approaching death, and ascribes it to his\ndead brother's call.\nP. 222. (A.B. 12.)\nThe following case was printed in the Religio-Philosophical Journal,\nMay 5th, 1894. Mr. B. B. Kingsbury, who contributed the case, states that\nthe informant is a member of the Presbyterian Church, and her husband\nhas confirmed her as to the statements of voices heard by the little boy calling\nhim. Mr. Kingsbury adds that both are worthy of the highest credit. The\nfather is somewhat of a \"sensitive\" and the mother has had two or three\n^ clairvoyant experiences herself.\nThe statement just as it was given by the mother runs as follows :\u2014\n\"Is there a life beyond the grave 1 Had I ever doubted that there is a\nlife beyond (which I never for a moment did), my doubt would have been\nremoved by what I call a vision. In 1883 I was the mother of two strong\nhealthy boys. The eldest was a bright boy of two years and seven months.\nThe other, a darling baby boy of eight months. August 6th, 1883, my baby\ndied. Ray, my little son, was then in perfect health. Every day after\nbaby's death (and I may safely say every hour in the day) he would say to\nme, ' Mamma, baby calls Ray. ' He would often leave his play and come\nrunning to me saying, ' Mamma, baby calls Ray all the time.' Every night\nhe would waken me out of my sleep and say, ' Mamma, baby calls Ray all\n\f430 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe time. He wants Ray to come where he is ; you must not cry when Ray\ngoes, Mamma, you must not cry, for baby wants Ray.' One day I was\nsweeping the sitting-room floor, and he came running as fast as he could\nrun, through the dining-room where stood the table with baby's high chair\n(which Ray now used) at the side. I never saw him so excited, and he\ngrabbed my dress and pulled me to the dining-room door, jerked it open\nsaying, ' Oh, Mamma, Mamma, come quick ; baby is sitting in his high\nchair.' As soon as he opened the door and looked at the chair he said, 'Oh,\nMamma, why didn't you hurry ; now he's gone ; he laughed at Ray when he\npassed the chair ; Oh, he laughed at Ray so nice. Ray is going with baby,\nbut you must not cry, Mamma. ' Ray soon became very sick. Nursing and\nmedicine were of no avail. He died October 13th, 1883, two months and\nseven days after baby's death. He was a child of high intelligence and\nmatured far beyond his years. Whether it is possible for the dead to\nreturn, and whether my baby came back and was seen by his little brother\nor not, we leave for others to judge.\"\nDefiance, Ohio, December VAth, 1894.\nMe. R. Hodgson, 5, Boylston Place, Boston, Mass.\nKind Sir,\u2014Your letter of November 27th received and noted. In reply\nwill say that Mr. Kingsbury's account in the Religw-Philosophical Journal\nfor May 5th last of my little boy's clairvoyance shortly before his death, is\ncorrect in every detail. When the child ran to me telling me the baby was\nsitting in his chair at the table, there was no one in the house but tho\nservant girl, little Ray and myself. I told the girl nothing about it and she\ndid not hear the child ; but as soon as my husband came to dinner I told\nhim. Afterthat we talked freely of the matter to several of our friends. Little\nRay knew nothing of death, we had never spoken of it to him in any way ;\nthe last time I took him to the baby's grave shortly before he was taken\nsick we were sitting by the grave and I thought, \" Oh ! if I could only take\nbaby up and look at it for just one minute, I would feel so glad.\" Instantly\nRay said to me, \" Mamma, let us take baby up and look at it just one minute;\nthen we will feel better.\" Just as we were leaving the grave he smoothed\nit with his little hand and said, \" Ray is going to lie down and sleep right\nhere beside little brother, but you must not cry, mamma.\" He is now lying\njust where he said he would.\nP.S.\u2014I wish to say that I have never known much of what is called\nmodern Spiritualism, but was born and reared a Presbyterian and still\nbelong to that church of which I am an active member. -p jj\nFebruary 27th, 1895.\nMr. R.

Just as with \" number-forms,\" \" sound-hearing,\" and\nthe like, children probably experience more vividly and frequently the\nvarious forms of sensory automatism which concern our present\nresearches.\nBeside these cases we may place a few others where the date of\ndeath has been foretold, or self-suggested, without any such strong or\ndepressing emotion as seemed obviously likely to affect the event.\nP. 146. Prediction of death fulfilled.\nThe following is a case of a prediction of death, of which information\nwas sent to us before it was known that the death had occurred, and which\nwas fulfilled within a day of the time foretold.\nThe Rev. Aug. Glardon, M.A., writes to Professor Sidgwick :\u2014\nTour-de-Pilz,\nSeptember Uth, 1893.\nOne of my aunts, Miss J.

From what I had been told, I thought the \" six weeks\"\nMiss V. had spoken of were to end to-morrow. Whether I am right or\nwrong, it remains a proved fact that my aunt announced the time of her\ndeath six weeks beforehand, to a day. Aug.

It was on the 4th of August, and it was a few days after that,\nbeing already half delirious, she said to her brother ; \" I have come to you\nfor six weeks. \"\nDuring the last month of her life she was almost constantly half un\nconscious, and never referred to what she had said.\nWhen I went to see her, two days before her death, she did not recognise\nme fully. It was then that her brother and sister-in-law told me that they\nexpected her to pass away on the 15th, explaining why. In fact, she died\nthe day before that. She was a woman of calm nerves and lymphatic\ntemperament.-Yours truly, Auo Glabdoh\nI may place here an odd case where the knowledge of impending\ndeath can hardly come from the decedent.\nP. 137.\nThe following appeared in the Religio-Philosophkal Jounud for November\n1st, 1890 :\u2014\nStateMent OP dE. SUddICk.\nFor some time past we have been holding spiritual seances, or circles,\nregularly every Tuesday and Friday evening at our home in Cuba, Mo., and\nhave gotten and are getting many messages, truthful and otherwise, although\nthe untruthful ones are few comparatively and are generally so from known\ncauses, such as misunderstanding of question asked, inharmony in circle,\n&c., &c. Most remarkable was a \" Prophecy and its Fulfilment,\" a hurried\nstatement of which appeared in the Better Way of October 18th. Two\nfriends had called in, namely, Charles H. Cottnam, bookkeeper for the firm\nof Newman and Jones, general merchants, and James E. Hollow, jun., of\nthe firm of Hollow and Son, dealers in stoves, hardware, and furniture, both\ndoing business at this place. Then, my wife and I sat around a small walnut\ncentre table, placing our hands on its top surface in the usual manner, and in\nabout ten or fifteen minutes the table began to move, indicating the presence\nof our spirit friends, or some intelligence with the power to move it, and\nanswer questions intelligently, as we found by asking. The lamp was sitting\non a piano in the corner of the room, turned down so as to make a subdued\nor mellow light, but not so low but that we could see what time it was by our\nwatches as we sat at the table, or jot down the communications as they were\nspelled out.\nMr. Cottnam had a friend, Mr. Chris. Varis, a prominent hotel keeper of\nSt. James, Phelps County, Mo., and a former resident of this place. His\ndisease was a chronic affection of the throat. Mr. C. had called on him a few\ndays previous and found him very weak and sinking fast. He could take no\nsolid food, and all the nourishment he got was by painful swallowing a little\neggnog or milk. His attendant physician, Dr. Headlee, of St. James, told\nMr. Cottnam that he thought Mr. Varis could live but a few days at most,\nand from his appearance Mr. Cottnam was of the same opinion. After many-\nother questions were asked and answered, the table answering by tipping two\nof its feet two or three inches off the floor, and then striking it again, once\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 433\nfor no, twice for don't know, and three times for yes. Mr. C. asked, \"Do\nyou know my friend Chris. Varis, of St. James, Mo. ?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is he\nany better than when I was with him last?\" \"No.\" \"Is he worse?\"\n\"Yes.\" \" Will I have time to get to him before he passes out if I take the\nnext train?\" \"Yes.\" \"Will he live over to-morrow?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do\nyou know when he will pass out?\" \"Yes.\" Then the table rocked back\nand forth slowly, the feet striking the floor forty times, making forty distinct\nraps, much to the surprise of all present, as we were expecting him to pass\nout much sooner. We counted, and found that the time indicated would be\nOctober 8th ; so to make sure we were right we asked, \" Will he pass out on\nOctober 8th?\" \"Yes.\" \" In the forenoon ? \" \"Yes.\" \" Will a telegram\nbe sent to me on the morning of the 8th to that effect 1\" \" Yes.\"\nA night or two after the above described seance Mr. Cottnam sat at\nanother house with different sitters, and received the following confirmation\nof the above. He says : \" We had been sitting only a few minutes when the\ntable began to move. I asked, 'Is the spirit demonstrating a friend of mine?'\n'Yes.' (Indicated by three distinct tips of the table.) ' Will you spell your\nname ? ' ' Yes. ' The alphabet was called in the usual way, and the letters\nsignalled by tips spelled Ben Walker. 'Are you my friend, Ben Walker, of\nSt. Louis?' 'Yes.' 'I was not aware of your demise ; when did you pass\nout ? ' Three distinct tips. ' Does that mean that it has been three days\nsince you passed out ? ' ' Yes. ' ' Is your body buried ? ' ' No. ' ' Will it be\nburied to-morrow ? ' 'Yes.' ' Do you know my friend Chris. Varis ? ' 'Yes.'\n' Will he pass out on October 8th?' 'Yes.' 'Are you sure of this ?' 'Yes.'\"\nMr. Cottnam was not aware of the death of Mr. Walker, and rather\ndoubted the truth of the message about him. The Globe Democrat of the\nnext day, however, confirmed the truth of his death and stated that the\ninterment was deferred until his son arrived from a distant city.\nThe prediction about Mr. Varis became an open secret, and was talked of\nfreely through the town from the morning of August 30th until October 8th,\nwhen a telegram came over the wires informing Mr. C. that Mr. Varis died\nthat morning at six o'clock.\nI append a letter from Dr. Headlee, the physician who attended Mr.\nVaris, which corroborates the account just given. I also send the signatures\nof twelve of our best citizens in further confirmation, and the signatures of\nthe sitters. Many more names could be obtained, but I judge the following\nto be sufficient.\nCuba, Mo. S- T' SuddICK' M-D-\nDear Doctor,\u2014About a week previous to the death of Mr. Chris. Varis\nI was in Cuba, and a friend was inquiring about him. I told him that on the\nevening before I did not think he would survive the night, but on that\nmorning he had rallied a little, that the chances all were that he would not\nlast twenty-four hours.

E. Perryman,\nBonne Terre, Mo.\nDear Friend,\u2014\n30th. We had a nice little circle last night, in our parlour, and good\nphenomena, so far as table-tipping goes. Myself, wife, and two neighbours,\ncomposed the circle. There were about a hundred questions asked, and all\nwere answered correctly, so far as we know.\nOne gentleman was requested to go to a sick friend, and was told the\nnumber of days he would live, &c., &c.\nS. T. Suddicr.\n(This extract appeared in the Religio-Philosophical Journal.) Dr.\nSuddick says that the letter was returned to him at his own request, and\nwrites :\u2014.\nYou will find that the first seven or eight lines were written August 29th\nand the remainder of the letter on the 30th, or part before and part after the\nsitting.\nMrs. Suddick sends the following account of the sitting :\u2014\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 435\nCuba, Mo., Nurember 9th, 1890.\nReplying to your favour of the 5th inst., requesting my confirmation of\nthe \"prophecy \" of which my husband wrote, I can say that I was one of the\nsitters ; the seance having taken place at our house. There were two other\nsitters besides my husband (Dr. Suddick) and self, namely, J. E. Hollow,\njun., and C. H. Cottnam. The message was given in answer to questions\nput by Mr. Cottnam concerning his friend Mr. Varis. He did not call the\nname of the latter at the time of the sitting, but only spoke of him as '' my\nfriend,\" and I, for one, did not know at the time to whom he referred. (I\n' think perhaps the other sitters did.) I heard casually the next day through a\nneighbour lady that Mr. Varis, of St. James, was expected to die at any\ntime, and associating the two incidents, I concluded that he was the sick\nfriend of whose demise Mr. C. had been questioning the \"spirits,\" and on\nenquiring found that I had surmised correctly.\nAt the sitting, Mr. Cottnam asked a number of questions about his sick\nfriend, among which were, \" Will he be alive when I arrive there V \" Will\nhe die to-morrow?\" \"Will he die the day after ?\" &c. After receiving\nnegative answers to the last two\u2014and perhaps the question whether he\nwould live a week was asked,\u2014I do not distinctly remember\u2014he requested\nthe controlling power to rap once for every day that his friend would yet\nlive, and the table rapped forty times : each of the sitters counted the raps\nas they were given distinctly by the table rising one side off the floor and\nstriking down again. On counting the forty days from that date we found\nthat the time of his death as prophesied would fall on the 8th of October.\n(The date of the prophecy was August 29th.) Mr. C. asked if the 8th of\nOctober was the day on which he would die, and the table rapped three\ntimes, the conventional signal for \"Yes.\" He then asked if the demise\nwould take place in daytime or at night ; in the forenoon or afternoon, etc.,\nand received answers that it would be in the daytime, and in the forenoon.\nAt several other seances, held at the home of Mr. Brickey and other\nplaces, these questions were again asked, and the answers repeated that Mr.\nVaris would die on the morning of October 8th, as at the first sitting. Of\nthese dates I am perfectly confident.\nIt may, and it may not, be superfluous to add, that, unlike my husband,\nI am not a confirmed believer in the spiritual origin of those phenomena\nwhich we have from time to time witnessed, such as movements of the\n; table by some unknown power ; intelligent answers to questions ; messages\ngiven through the alphabet, etc., but have been undecided whether to\nattribute them to telepathy, thought-transference, or some other unknown\nmental or magnetic quality residing in the sitters themselves, or whether,\nas so many believe, it is really through the direct agency of the disembodied.\nWishing your Society much success in its rational and most scientific way\nof dealing with these occult problems,\u2014I am, very truly,\nLouise F. Suddicr.\nMr. Hodgson has also received letters from Mr. I. P. Brickey, Mr. E.\nA. Evans, and Mr. J. A. Rost, confirming the authenticity of their testi\nmony quoted above. Mr. Brickey states that it w as at his house that the\n*&nce at which the prophecy was confirmed was held.\n\f436 F. W. H. Myers.\nMr. Evans writes :\u2014\nCuba, Mo., November 8th, 1890.\nTouching the matter cited in yours of the 4th inst., I desire to say that\nmy signature subscribed to the published statement of Dr. Suddick, relative\nto the prophesied death of Chris. Varis, of St. James, Mo., is authentic.\nFurther, in this connection I desire to say that I never attended a seance, as\nit is called, I believe, in my life, have no experience in that line, and have\nno personal knowledge upon which to base belief nor unbelief of Spiritual\nism. But I was told by parties that met at Dr. Suddick's residence, some\nweeks before the demise of Chris. Varis, that by raps with, or on a table, I\ndo not know which, they were told that Varis would die in 40 days, or\nOctober 8th, and he did die on the date as given. \u00ab\nEugene A. Evans.\nThere remained an important question to determine : whether Mr. Varis\nhad known of the prophecy, making it possible that it had brought about its\nown fulfilment. The following letter and statement give the result of Dr.\nSuddick's inquiries on this point :\u2014\nCuba, Mo., December 23rd, 1890.\nI received your recent letter several days ago, but thought it would\nperhaps be more satisfactory to you and your Society for me to go and see\nMrs. Varis, widow of Mr. Chris. Varis, myself. So yesterday (Sunday) I\nboarded the noon train, and on arriving found Mrs. Varis and her two\ndaughters, young ladies, very intelligent and clever people. On introducing\nthe subject, just a shade of vexation passed over Mrs. V.'s face, and she\nmade haste to say, \"We are not Spiritualists, and knew nothing of the\nprophecy until we saw it in the Crawford Mirror, at least two weeks after\nMr. Varis' death. I was very much vexed, as we believe nothing in such\nfoolishness. . . . \"\nI explained that the parties who had signed their names to the paper had\nnot intended it to appear m the local press. Mrs. V. said she had felt very\nbadly about having her husband's name bandied about in that way in a\nnewspaper, but when Mr. Cottnam explained the matter, and Dr. Headlee\nsaid he knew of the prophecy, and that the morning of the 8th of October\nhad been specified as the time in which he should die, a week or more\nbefore his death occurred, she felt that there must be some truth in it, as she\ncould not doubt Dr. Headlee.\n\"Mrs. Varis, did your husband know anything about the prophecy\nbefore his death ? \"\n\"No, indeed,\" she said, \"none of us knew anything about it until two\nweeks after his death.\"\n\"Might not Dr. Headlee have said something to him about it during one\nof his visits, without your knowing it ? \"\n\"Oh, dear no,\" she said, \" I was always present at these visits, and know\nno such talk occurred at any of them. No, I am positive Dr. Headlee never\nmentioned it, and that Mr. V. never knew it.\"\nI then wrote up the little memorandum enclosed, and she signed it, or\nrather her daughter did, at her request, in my presence.\nI then went out and found Dr. Headlee, and he said in answer to my\nquestions :\u2014\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 437\n\" No, I know positively that Mr. V. knew nothing of the prophecy ; no\none in St. James knew anything of it but myself, and I did not want him\nto find it out. \" o m o\nS. T. Suddicr.\nTo all whom rr may concern : - This is to certify that I am positive\nthat my husband knew nothing whatever of the prophecy of his death, made\nat a Spiritual circle held at the home of Dr. S. T. Suddick, in Cuba, Mo., on\nAugust 29th last. We did not hear of it for about two weeks after his\ndeath. We are not Spiritualists. (Signod) Mm. A. Varis.\nWe may add that Spiritualistic seances (without professional mediums)\nare very frequently held in Cuba, Mo., which is, we understand, a town of\nsome 550 inhabitants ; and that other prophecies have been made which\nhaTe come true, as the following letter written by Dr. Suddick to Colonel\nBundy, editor of the Religio-Philosophical Joifrnal (and received from\nColonel Bundy by Mr. Hodgson on October 28th, 1890), will show. They\nare, however, decidedly less striking than the instance we have given, and it\nwould be difficult to estimate their evidential value without a precise state\nment of the number of prophecies that have not come true.\n\"We had a sitting,\" says Dr. Suddick, \"about a month ago, spirits\nstating that ' a woman would die in Cuba on October 20th,' but they would\nnot spell the name. Miss Anna Long died here that day.\n\" Parson Stillwell, a very old gentlemen, was quite feeble, and a few\nnights ago at a circle some one asked how long he would live. The spirits\nspelt out, ' He will die to-night. ' In the morning he was dead.\n\"The spirits kept parties in Cuba posted in the wheat market, noting all\nthe changes from to three or four days ahead, all this fall. Thousands have\nbeen made here.\"\nIn the next case the death seems to have been due to natural\ncauses, which could not, one would think, have been foreseen from\nhowever intimate a view of the subject's organism at the time when\nthe presentiment first appeared.\nP. 148. 433, Harrison Street, Topeka, Kansas,\nSeptember 1st, 1893.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I have a painful duty to perform in\nacquainting you with the sickness and death of my mother, Mrs. Enoch\nChase. My mother was taken sick on Saturday morning, July 29th, with\nbilious fever. The fever, after a run of ten days, ceased and she seemed to\nbe improving rapidly. She continued improving, so much so that on Wed\nnesday and Thursday, the 16th and 17th, she sat up a little, but on Friday\nmorning we noticed she seemed weak. A little later she had a sinking spell\nfrom which she gradually passed into unconsciousness. After a great effort\nwe revived her, but from that time on she gave up entirely and failed rapidly\nuntil Sunday evening at seven o'clock, when she passed away. Please notice\nthe Friday, Saturday and Sunday mentioned in her premonition, which\ncorrespond with the last three days of her sickness, after the relapse took\nplace.\n\f438 F. W. H. Myers.\nWe found the sealed envelope after her death in her box of private papers.\nShe has told us ever since my father's death, which occurred April 24th, 1888,\nthat she would only survive him five years. We did not pay the attention\nto this that we now wish we had.\nMrs. S. J. Crawford.\n[A sealed envelope, with inscription and contents as given below,\nwas found among Mrs. E.

Mother\nEnclosure in Envelope.\nTopeka, December 28th, 1891.\nIt has come to my mind this morning that perhaps I had better leave this\npremonition in this shape.\nEver since the death of my husband, on the 24th of April, 1888, I have\nfelt that five (5) years is, or will be, the limit to me of life. There has been\nno sudden expression in that way, but the knowledge has seemed to follow\nme like the knowledge of any other fact, \u2014say this is Friday, and I am\nthinking of doing something in a day or two, I would just think, to-morrow\nwill be Saturday and the next will be Sunday, then I can't do it. The\nthought always follows me, just quietly and naturally : Five years. Now,\nif I shmdd live six years, I will destroy this, but if my premonition comes\ntrue, I wish this sent to Mr. Richard Hodgson, 5, Boylston-place, Boston,\nMass., with particulars.\nSend to Dr. Richard Hodgson, 5, Boylston-place, Boston, Mass.\nMrs. E. Chase.\nRe Mrs. Chase.\nBaxter Springs, May 10th, 1894.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014You ask me my mother's age at\nthe time she made her prediction. She was about sixty-nine and a half years\nold when she wrote it out. She was born on June 22nd, 1822, wrote out\nher prediction December 28th, 1891, and died August 20th, 1893. I think\nthe fact came to her the very day of my father's death, April 24th, 1888.\nMy mother's friend, Mrs. Silas Rain, of Topeka, told me that my mother\nsaid as much to her the night after my father's death. Mother talked to me\nmany times about it, but not so soon as she did to Mrs. Rain. Some weeks\nmust have passed before she mentioned it to me. I cannot remember when\nI first heard her talk about it.\nIsarelle M. Crawford.\n(Mrs. S. J. Crawford,\n433, Harrison Street, Topeka, Kan. )\nHere is another case, where there may have been some subliminal\nperception of danger to the child's health. The coincidence involved\nis imperfect.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 439\nP. 157.\nFrom a gentleman in Boston, known to Dr. Hodgson, who desires that\nhis name may not be published.\nIn the year 1872 I lived in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. I had then four\nchildren, two boys and two girls. The boys slept in one room, the girls in\nanother, and on the same floor was my own chamber. One night I had a\ndream that I shall never forget, and it is as vivid to my mind to-day as at\nthe time of its occurrence.\nI dreamed of being in a large, square room on the ground floor. Outside\nthe window was a hearse, and in it a coffin containing the body of my\nyounger son. Just as I turned away from the window I saw a man with the\nbody of my younger daughter in his arms, with her head hanging off his\nshoulder, with her eyes wide open, staring at me. I said to the man,\n\"Don't take her, she ain't dead.\" He replied, \"Yes, she is dead ; that's\nthe way they look when they die that death.\"\nI awoke with a cold perspiration, arose, and with a light I visited the\nrooms where my little ones slept. I examined their pulse, put my hand on\ntheir heads, and found them to be apparently, in perfect health, and sleeping\nthe sweet sleep of childhood. I returned to my chamber and sat on the edge\nof my bed, thinking of my dream, when my wife awoke. I told her of my\ndream. It impressed me so that it was over an hour before I again went to\nsleep.\nThe next morning my boy, whom I saw in the hearse, awoke in a high\nfever and did not leave his bed for nearly six weeks. All through his sick\nness the dream was a great source of anxiety to myself and my wife. Good\nmedical attention and careful nursing at last restored him to health. All my\nchildren are men and women grown, and from that day I have had no serious\nsickness in my family.\nSuch a dream ! What was its significance ? Merely a coincidence 1 Or,\nwas it a warning to give the case all the care possible to save the child's life.\nSouth Boston, July 25th, 1892.\nRichard Hodgson, Esq.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I cannot recall any other dream\nof a similar nature, nor can I, as a rule, upon awakening, recall the details\nof a dream that I had during the night, although I can recall the fact that\nI made up vmy mind, at the time of the dream, that I would recall it.\nDreams do not often come to me, and this is the only one that to me had\nany significance.\nThere was not much illness in P. at this time, and in fact, it was unusually\nhealthy. There was no child's death, at or near the time, that I had any\npersonal knowledge of. I enclose a note from my wife, as desired.\nMrs. C. confirms as follows : \u2014\nSouth Boston, July 20th, 1892.\nR. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014The facts in relation to the dream that my\nhusband had during his residence in Pittsburg, Pa., are just as stated by\nhim. We talked them over at the time, and I shall always remember his\nwaking up and going into the sleeping rooms of our children, and his telling\nme of his dream before he again went to sleep.\n\f440 F. W. H. Myers.\nIn order to form an opinion on such cases as these, we shall have\nto compare other narratives, where deaths have been predicted by\npersons other than the decedents themselves. But before approaching\nthat topic, we must pause on a small group of cases which, if the\ntheory here advanced to explain them should contain any truth, form\nan interesting link in our argument.\nWe have been reviewing evidence which tends to show that a\nman's subliminal self may sometimes perceive his own approaching\ndeath, and may transmit this knowledge to the empirical self,\nsometimes by aid of a hallucination. Now we know that the\nsubliminal self may sometimes communicate to other persons know\nledge which it cannot or does not communicate to its own empirical\nself. This is familar enough in hypnotic experiments, or in spon\ntaneous automatic script, which script may be (for instance) written in\na position turned away from the automatist, and may remain unknown\nto him, although its content must have come from, or passed through,\nhis own deeper being. We know also that an agent has sometimes\nsucceeded in transmitting a phantasmal image of himself to a\npercipient at a distance, without knowing whether he has, in fact, been,\nsuccessful or no.\nIt is natural, therefore, to ask whether there is anything to show-\nthat the subliminal self ever reveals the approach of death, not to its ,\nown empirical self, but to other persons ;\u2014showing, perhaps, by a\nphantasmal image, the source from which the information comes.\nTo this question we have some ground for returning an affirmative\nanswer ;\u2014 although of course the greater the interval between appari\ntion and death, the greater also is the plausibility of an explanation of\nthe coincidence as due to chance alone. There are various cases where\nthe- phantom of a person destined soon to die has been seen by a\npercipient at a distance; nor does it seem that such an apparition\ndepends upon the decedent's own supraliminal effort. On the contrary,\nit often appears while he is asleep or in a comatose condition. Such\ncases are familiar to readers of Phantasms of the I.iving, where they\nare classed among other apparitions \" at a time of death or crisis,\"\u2014\nthe crisis being, of course, the agent's\u2014perhaps only subliminal\u2014\nperception that death is imminent. It is not always clear by how-\nmany hours they precede death in one case, for example, (Journal,\nDecember, 1885, and see Proceedings, Vol. IV., p. 307), the apparition\ncoincides with the onset of a rapidly fatal attack of diphtheria.\nFrom that case to the following there is no very great step.\nooo. lgl Cornwall Terrace, N.W., November 20th, 1889.\nTowards the end of March, 1878, in the dead of the night, while believing\nmyself to be awake, I thought the door at the head of my bed was opened\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 441\nand a white figure passed along the side of the bed to the foot, where it faced\na\\\u00bbut and showed me it was covered head and all in a shroud. Then with\nits hands it suddenly parted the shroud over the face, revealing between its\ntwo hands the face of my sister, who was ill in another room. I exclaimed\nher name, whereupon the figure vanished instantly. Next day (and certainly\non account of the shock given me by the above experience), I called in Sir\nW. Jenner, who said my sister had not many days to live. [She died, in\nfact, very soon afterwards.]\nI was in good health, without any grief or anxiety. My sister was being\nattended by our family doctor, who did not suspect anything serious, there\nfore I had had no anxiety at all on her account, nor had she herself.\nI have never, either before or after this, had such an experience.\n(Signed) G. J. Romanes.\nThe impression made by this incident upon the late Dr. Romanes,\nF.R.S., was, as he more than once told me, very deep ; nor was there,\nhe thought, any such anxiety in his mind at the time with regard to his\nsister as could have predisposed him to this unique hallucination.\nThere were, I may add, other unpublished circumstances which\nconfirmed him in his view of the matter.\nThe following case seems pretty closely parallel.\nL. 861. Ad Pn Borderland. Visual.\nFrom Mr. J. H. Kennedy, through Professor Barrett.\nRepeated appearances of an apparition, as in this experience, seem to be\nvery unusual.\n[Dublin], July 20th, 1889.\nOn the night of the 10th, or rather morning of 11th February, 1884,\nwhile sleeping on a bed formed by chairs in my dining-room, my wife having .\nbeen confined the night previous, I was startled by a most remarkable\nvision.\nMy cousin, Miss Amy Flint, passed by the side of my bed several times\nfrom the foot, disappearing at the head, and carrying in her hand, with her\narm stretched out, a virgin's lamp. After she had passed several times 1\nstarted up in bed, the thought having struck me that my wife had either\npassed away or had become seriously ill. I sat up in the bed in a state of\nfear and anxiety, not knowing what to do, fearing if I went up to the\nbedroom I might startle my wife and perhaps cause her death, and reasoning\nto myself that if anything was wrong the nurse would certainly let me know.\nDuring all this time the figure continued to pass and repass with a solemn,\nsteady tread. Having watched and listened for some time, my cousin ceased\nto pass. I lay down, fell asleep, and thought no more of it, excepting to go\nup and inquire about my wife and child early that morning. They were both\ndoing well, so I dismissed the thing from my mind, till about 10 o'clock, when\nmy cousin's brother called to say his sister had passed away just at the time\nof my vision. In consequence of this extraordinary occurrencB I had the\ninfant called after her, Amy.\n\f442 F. W. H. Myers.\nI may say my cousin had been for a long time in consumption, but the day\nprevious appeared much better, went out by herself in good spirits and visited\nmy sisters- J. H. Kennedy.\nMr. Kennedy does not seem to have mentioned his vision to anyone before\nhe heard of his cousin's death, and his aunt, to whom he mentioned it some\nweeks afterwards, is dead.\nHe writes later to correct the date given in his first account, saying that\nhis daughter Amy was born on January 2nd, 1883, and that his cousin died a\nfew days later, on January 7th, and we have verified these two dates\nindependently by reference to the Register of Births and Deaths. The fact\nof his daughter being named after his cousin in consequence of the occurrence,\nas mentioned in his first letter, affords some independent evidence of the\ncorrespondence in the dates of the apparition and the death. Note, however,\nthe disposition to exaggerate coincidences which this mistake illustrates.\nMr. Kennedy states that he has experienced no other hallucinations, but\nhe recently had a dream of a distressing kind, which made a good deal of\nimpression on him, and which there is some reason to think was telepathic.\nIn an interview with Professor Barrett he also related an experience which\noccurred to his mother. This was a veridical vision or dream of the\nsudden death of a friend, and is of interest as being an instance tending to\nshow a hereditary faculty of \" second-sight.\"\nThe following case, again, is of the same type. The informant is\nknown to me ; her father was a very distinguished public man.\nP. 307.\nProm the Hon. Mrs. M , A. Adjutant General's House, Royal Barracks,\nDublin. 1884.\nMy sister was in the habit of getting up at 5 a.m. and of going to my\nfather's room (who was not well at the time) to give him tea, and then\nreading to him until about 7. I asked her one day if she would call me\nsometimes, that I should like to get up at 5. She refused, saying she\nthought \" I did quite enough in the day and had better be in bed.\" The\nnext morning, however, Thursday, to my surprise I awoke and saw her\nstanding at the foot of my bed, looking very bright indeed, and I fancied in a\nwhite dressing-gown. The curtains were drawn over the windows and the\nlight seemed somehow only to strike her figure. She said, \"Remember I\nhave called you, it is 5 o'clock, and now I am going away ; I am going away,\nremember. \" I fell asleep and did not wake until eight. At breakfast I said\nto my sister, \"So you did come and call me after all!\" She looked\nastonished and said, \" No, I did not. \" I said, \"Do you mean that you did\nnot come at 5 o'clock and say ' Remember I have called you, and now I\nam going away \"t \" \" No, \" she said, \" I never came near your room.\" She,\nhowever, questioned me in rather an agitated way, and to my surprise said,\n\"I don't like those sort of dreams.\" I never heard her say anything of the\nsort before, and was rather surprised at her thinking twice about it.\nThe next day, Friday, having been in perfect health and spirits up to that\nmorning, she was taken ill whilst sitting by my father's side, at about t>\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 443\no'clock, and she died at 5 o'clock the day week, Thursday, of my dream or\nvision ; and a curious coincidence was that she had on a white muslin\ndressing-gown in which she had sat up during part of the night. I do not\nrecollect that during the fluctuation of this short illness, from which at first\nno danger was apprehended, this strange incident occurred to my memory,\nbut as the clock struck 5 on that sad morning I remembered.\nThere is another dream connected with that sad short illness.\nMy father, the second night before my sister was taken ill, dreamed that\nhe asked her to go on with the \"Life of Charles James Fox,\" the second\nI volume of which was not then in the house. He dreamed that she said, \"Oh\nthere is no more for me to read, that is the end,\" and she held up the volume\nshe had read to him, open at the last page, across the half of which he saw\nprinted in very large black, thick letters, filling the page quite across,\nTHE END.\nHe said it gave him a sort of shock which awoke him, and he still felt a\npainful shock, he could not say why, when he awoke and remembered it.\nAnd yet he was half amused at feeling it a shock or remembering it at all.\nHe, however, did not mention it that day, because he, being ill, thought\nmy mother might not like it. The day my sister died he told us. The\nstrange thing was that it was the same night, or rather morning, and about\nthe same time that I thought I saw her : for soon after he awoke he saw her\ncome in with his tea, but did not, I believe, tell her the dream.\nIt was strange that she finished that book, and that it was the last time\ni she ever read to him, and that that night was the end of one phase of family\nlife in many ways. My father never recovered her death, and everything\nchanged soon after.\nMy father was the late Field-Marshal , and, as anyone will know, not\na man likely to think of dreams in general, and up to the day of his death\nwas in intellect and faculties like a man of 30. [Field-Marshal Lord S. died\nin 1863.]\nFrom this case, again, there is but one step to the next,\u2014which\ninvolves prevision of a death more sudden and unexpected. This case,\nwhich comes from a lady who does not wish her name to be printed, is\nremote in date ; but the danger of illusion of memory is perhaps less\nin a witness before the fact other than the percipient than it would\n^ have been in a remote case testified to by the percipient himself. One\nis hardly likely to imagine, without foundation, that one has been told\nby two persons of a special incident affecting both of them, before it\noccurred. On the other hand, the hearing one's name called is a\ncommon form of subjective illusion.\nP. 637.\nThe late Colonel M., of the Militia, resided at S. I was companion to\nbis wife for many years, travelled with them into various countries on the\nContinent, and altogether was with her more than 30 years. At the time\nwhen I went to them Mr. M. 's elder brother, Thomas, was a captain in the\nMilitia where Mr. M. was an officer, and the regiment remained at B. for\n\f444 F. W. H. Myers.\n12 months. B. is six miles from S. and Mr. M. used to come home every\nevening. One cold evening in the month of March, in the year 1855, Mr. and\nMrs. M. sat reading for a while over a fire in the bedroom before going to\nbed. At 11 o'clock they were startled by hearing the brother call aloud\n\"Will\" on the stairhead, the name by which he was accustomed to call\nMr. M. Both heard the voice, and Mr. M. rushed to the stairhead\nexclaiming, \"Whatever brings you here?\" he having left him at B. and\nsupposing him to be there. There was no one to be seen. When I went to\nthem in the morning they told me immediately of what had occurred. They\nhad been very much disturbed by it through the night. During the day\nMr. M. rejoined his regiment at B. as usual. His brother Thomas was\nthere still and apparently well. But in the evening about six o'clock, when\nthe exercises of the day were over, he was standing in the street with him\nwhen he suddenly dropped down dead. From frequent references to the\nsubject in after years I know that Colonel and Mrs. M. were firmly convinced\nthat the voice they heard was a reality, and that it was an intimation of the\nimpending death of Captain Thomas. The fact that they told me of it in the\nmorning, when the captain was still well and likely to live, shows that it\ncould not be an imaginary thing on their part, the result of apprehension\nrespecting him. Colonel M. and his wife were among the most excellent\npeople I ever knew, and 1 remained at the Hall till the grave had closed\nfirst over him and then, nearly 15 years afterwards, over her.\nOctober 21st, 1889. E. W.\nThe next case presents an element of reciprocity, which of course\nadds to its evidential value.\nP 256.\nMrs. Tabour writes to Dr. Hodgson :\u2014\n2718, Chicago-avenue, Minneapolis, Minn.\nMay 8th, 1895.\nI have recently learned of a case of remarkable appearance before death,\nor rather a short time previous to death. A man ill with consumption\nappeared to a lady (a friend of mine and also a friend of his) in a perfectly\nnatural manner, properly clothed, although he was ill in bed at the time, and\nwas found upon investigation to have been asleep at the time of the\nappearance. Now, the reason why they were able to establish the above\nfact so accurately was that the man related to his wife, directly upon awaking,\nthat he had dreamed of this lady in the most vivid manner, and described\nher appearance, and the position of the furniture in her rooms. The two\nfamilies were about one day's journey apart, by rail. The man died about a\nfortnight later. These people are willing to give dates and names, and if you\nwill have your secretary prepare a list of such questions as you may want\nanswered, and forward to me, I will get all information possible. I think it\nmay be well to see to the matter while I am here.\u2014Very sincerely yours,\nJosie L. Fowler Tarour.\nMrs. Tabour adds : \u2014\nMrs. Shagren is a woman of strong clairvoyant powers. All the parties\nare of Swedish birth, and of unusual intelligence. At the time of this\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 445\nappearance, Mrs. Shagren was about thirty-one. Occurred over ten years\nago. No appearance at time of death.\nStatement of Mrs. Shagren Regarding Appearance of\nMr. Hendrickson.\nThis happened one day after I had finished my morning's work, housework.\nIt was about ten o'clock. I stood before the mirror doing my hair, when I\nsuddenly saw him [Mr. Hendrickson], coming from behind, as if approaching on\ntip-toe. His hands were outstretched, and I had an impression that he would\n) place them on my shoulders ; I could even hear his last step, like the squeak of\na boot, as he put his foot down. I turned in surprise, and faced him,\nconsequently seeing him out of the glass and in the glass. As I turned I\nexclaimed, ' ' Is that you ? \" At least I felt that I said that, but as I spoke\nhe vanished. He was perfectly natural in appearance, and fully dressed,\njust as I had always seen him.\nIn the afternoon of the same day, which I know was April 24th, 1884, as\nI was passing from the room in which I had seen him in the morning,going\nthrough a small hall-way, I heard steps from behind. Turned and saw him\nagain, dressed as in the morning, and again as I turned toward him he\nvanished.\nThe impression of seeing him was not so strong as in the morning.\nThe next day, a young lady friend of mine, and also a friend of Mr.\nHendrickson's family came to visit me, and knowing of her friendship with\nMr. Hendrickson I asked her if she knew anything of the family, or where\nthey were living, as I had heard nothing from them for about four years, I\nhaving been south during that time, and they in the meantime having left the\ncity.\nI asked if she knew if Mr. Hendrickson was still living, as I knew he had\nconsumption. She replied that he was living the last time she had heard from\nthem. And then I said \" I saw him yesterday morning.\"\nMy friend was not surprised, and regarded the appearance as a warning of\ndeath. To my statement she said, \"I would not be surprised, as I received\na letter from his wife saying he had a hemorrhage of the lungs.1 Let us\nwrite,\"she continued, \"and find out if he is living or dead.\" Then we wrote\nwe both felt uneasy and 1 told of seeing him. In a few days we received a\nreply saying that he was not dead, but the doctors had said he could not live,\nand then [Mrs. H.] related his experience of seeing me in a dream, while asleep\non the morning he had appeared to me. Although he had never been in\nthe house he described my room, and said to his wife, when speaking of his\ndream, \"she looked stouter than she used to,\" which was true, as I had\ngrown much stouter in the four years since they had seen me.\nMrs. Hendrickson and myself were friends from childhood. I had only\nknown Mr. Hendrickson since his marriage. We were just good friends.\nMr. Hendrickson once told his wife that I had appeared to him. That was\nlong before my experience of seeing him.\n1 Hemorrhage of the lungs has been associated with psychical manifestations\noftener than from the relative frequency of that mode of death would seem ante\ncedently probable.\n2 K\n\f446 F. W. H. Myers.\nMrs. Hendrickson has re-married, and is now Mrs. Erickson of Beresford,\nSouth Dakota. (Signed) [Mrs.] C. M. Shagren.\n708, South 6 Street.\nBeresford, S.D., May 27th, 1895.\nMrs. C. M. Shagren, \u2014Dear Friend,\u2014I received your welcome letter*\nfew days ago and will now answer it. It was in the morning of April 24th.\n1884, when Mr. Hendrickson awoke and said he had been dreaming of you.\nI said \"I'll mark this down and see if it means something.\" He slept longer\nthat morning than he used to do, and in five days we had a letter from you\nand you said you had seen him in your room that morning and you thought\nsomething would happen to him before long. He was dressed in his night\nclothes at the time. On the 20th of May he died. I wrote to Dora, but I do\nnot remember what I did write or when it was. It was before he died,\nanyway. I had not heard from you since you went to Tennessee until this\ntime. I believe you said in your letter that you got my address from\nDora- , , , , Mrs. F. Erickson.\nBeresford, S. Dak.\nBox 156.\nFrom private letter written by Miss Dora Edenoff, of Chicago, June 14th,\n1895, to Mrs. Shagren.\nI have been trying to think, but cannot remember what you said about\nMr. Hendrickson. It does seem that you did tell me that you had seen him\nin your room, but I cannot remember any more.\u2014Your friend, Dora.\nIn reply to Dr. Hodgson's question how Mrs. Shagren remembered that\nthe date was April 24th, 1884, Mrs. Tabour adds :\u2014\nThere are many reasons why Mrs. Shagren remembered that date. First\nbecause of the young lady, who came from another city, and was on her way\nto Europe, and other facts which I might tell you if necessary. I looked\ninto it pretty carefully as I am rather a doubter myself. . . .\nIn the case next quoted the phantasm indicates not death precisely,\nbut an impending condition of decay.\nP. 251.\n[The following statement comes from a lady known to me, who has also\ndescribed the incident to me orally. Owing to the painful nature of the\nincident, the writer does not wish to ask her mother for the narrative which\nshe sent to her at the time. It is of course possible that she may have\nsub-consciously noted indications of impending decay.]\nIn the autumn of 1892 I was in Paris, staying with a near relative of\nmine, of whom I am very fond, and who was a most distinguished and clever\nman in his profession, that of a lawyer.\nHe had not been quite himself for some weeks and had complained in his\nletters to me (I was in England at the time) of feeling nervous and unfit for\nwork, in fact run down. As his letters made me feel uneasy, I wrote and\noffered a visit, saying a change to Paris would be beneficial to me, and took\nup my abode in his pretty aiiparkment, near the Boulevard Haussmann.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 447\nMy relative is a bachelor, and has one servant, a valet, who does not\nsleep in the appartement, but, according to Paris custom, has a room on\nthe 5ieme ; therefore we two were alone in the house at night. My room was\nat one end of a passage, and his at the other, several rooms intervening.\nA few days after my arrival, I received a budget of important papers to\nread, and a request to translate into English an article out of a French\nmedical paper. Not having had time to do this all day, I postponed the\ntranslation till after my relative had gone to bed, as he generally retired\nearly. As it was a chilly night, I thought I would take the lamp into my room,\nand work out the translation after I was in bed. I read several letters first,\nand then started on my task, aided by a dictionary, as the French technical\nterms staggered me rather, now and then. This is to show you my mind\nwas fully occupied, and that not only was I wide awake but that I was not\nin any way brooding on my relative's nervous state, nor indeed was I thinking\nof him. As I was writing most energetically, I saw, as one can see without\nraising one's eyes, one of the doors of my room slowly open, and, as I\nimagined it could only be my relative, who was restless, and was coming in\nto have a chat, I said, without even troubling to look up \" Come in, I'm not\nasleep.\" Receiving no answer, I looked up, and saw a most awful sight. (I\nmust tell you my relative was a singularly handsome man, very tall, and an\nintelligent, bright face.)\nI saw, staggering into the room, a likeness of him, but in the last stage of\nimbecility. He had shrunk down to half his height, his legs seemed semi-\nparalysed, and unable to support his tottering emaciated form. His face was\ndrawn, all character and expression had left it, the lower jaw drooped, and\nthe eyes had no intelligence or recognition in them, nothing but a vacant,\nhideous stare ! This thing,\u2014for I can call it nothing else\u2014staggered across\nmy room, looking round at me now and then, then made for the opposite\ndoor, where it groped about aimlessly for the handle, and finally succeeded\nin opening it, tumbled itself into the next room, and disappeared. I sat up\nin bed frozen with horror, and gazed at this till it vanished, then jumped out\nof bed, and ran along the passage into my relative's room. He was sound\nasleep in bed, and there was no sign anywhere of the ghastly semblance of\nhimself that I had seen. I could not get to sleep, and this awful sight\nhaunted me for weeks. I naturally spoke of it to no one in Paris, but wrote\nan account of it, much as I am doing now, to my mother, in England. Some\nweeks later my relative, feeling his nerves no better, consulted an eminent\nphysician, and a specialist for nervous complaints. The doctor did not alarm\nhim, but told me privately he much feared that creeping paralysis and\nsoftening of the brain would set in.\nHis diagnosis was only too correct ; at the present moment my poor\nrelative is in a private hospital ; he went steadily from bad to worse, all the\ndreadful symptoms of his disease increased visibly and rapidly, and now\n(autumn of 1895) he is very nearly like the ghastly vision I saw of him in\n1892, and which, may be, was sent in some measure to prepare us for the\ngreat sorrow in store for us all.\nMy relative was, at the time of this incident, about 43 years of age, and\nas handsome, intelligent, and charming a man as one could wish to see\u2014the\nvery last person for whom one could foresee such a fearful end.\n2 k 2\n\f448 F. W. H. Myers.\nI give no names, or address, as he is still alive, and it would be unpleasant\nfor our family. Apart from that, the details are absolutely exact.\nHere is another case of somewhat similar type, but where the\napproaching end was even harder to foresee. The narrative was given\nto Mr. Gurney.\nP. 253. From Mrs. Chaproniere.\n2, Hotham-villas, Putney.\nApril 14<fc, 1888.\nI was in my bedroom being undressed by my maid, Mrs. Gregory, who\nhad been with me for 41 years, and she was unfastening my bracelet when I\nsaw, just behind her about two feet off, her exact resemblance. She was\nthen in perfect health. I said to her, \" Why Mrs. Gregory, I see your\nfetch.\" She smiled and said, \"Really, ma'am,\" but was not in the least\nalarmed. On the following Sunday, she was only poorly. I went for a doctor\nat once, who said she was a little out of sorts. On Wednesday evening she\nsuddenly died. It was about the same time that her double had appeared to\nme just a week before. This was about 15 years ago.\nSophie Chaproniere.\nI have seen Mrs. Chaproniere, and questioned her about the case. She\ntold me that she had never had a hallucination of vision on any other occa\nsion. The \"double\" was as distinct as the real person, and an exact\nreproduction. The death was very sudden. Mrs. Gregory had been slightly\nunwell for a couple of days before it took place, but was able to enjoy her\nfood, and no anxiety was felt on her account. A daughter of Mrs Chap\nroniere states that she clearly remembers that her mother mentioned the\napparition at once, before the death. \u2014E. G.\nApril 2ith, 1888.\nBut perhaps the most interesting case in this group is the following\nwhich I give translated from the Annates des Sciences Psychiques, July-\nAugust, 1891.\nHere it seems certain that three persons of education and probity,\nassembled together in no excitement of mind, did all of them see a\nphantasmal figure, vaguely resembling a living person, ill in bed at\nthe time, perform a certain movement,\u2014simple, indeed, but with no\nobvious meaning. One of these persons afterwards saw the invalid\nwalk to the door in the same way, at a moment which had in his eyes\nespecial solemnity, as bringing the definite announcement of her\napproaching death.\nP. 210. Case of the Rue Jacoe.\nMlle L. IsnarcFs account.\nOne evening in January, 1878, I had an hallucination. My mother was\nthen living, and my brother, my sister, and myself lived with her. My\nfather had been dead a year and a half.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 449\nWe were very anxious about my mother, who was seriously ill, and had\nkept her bed for four months. This evening she had told us that she was\nbetter, and we felt relieved and more hopeful.\nIt was about 8 o'clock, we were all with her trying to amuse her, and\ntalking of her recovery, when she looked at us with a smile and said, \" I\nwant you all to dine together this evening; it is a long time since you did so,\nand all on my account. (One of us always remained with her.) I shall\nsee you from here, and it will be like being with you.\" We did as she\nwished.\nThe dining room communicated with my mother's room by folding glass\ndoors ; these were surrounded by curtains. The dining room was large, and\nlonger than it was broad; it was a cold, dull room, on account of its low ceiling,\nits painted walls and high, dark panels. The only window looked upon a\ndark court. Three other doors opened out of it, one into an antechamber,\nanother, nearly opposite, opened into a narrow passage leading to the front\nrooms, the third opened into a sort of dressing closet. Entering the dining-\nroom from the ante-chamber, the window was close to the door on the\nright ; the door of my mother's room was divided from the window by a\npanel. In the evening the room brightened up a little, but it was always\ndim in the corners.\nWe were just sitting down when the bell rang. It was a friend who had\ncome to enquire after our mother, and she asked him to dinner. At table I\nhad the bedroom door on my right, and the door of the corridor was exactly\nopposite. M. Menon and my brother were at my left ; my sister, whose\nseat was at my right, had gone to the the kitchen to prepare my mother's\ndrink.\nWe talked of indifferent matters ; my mother joined in the conversation,\nand I could see her face, lighted by a little lamp at her side. She seemed\ncalm.\nAfter a time she grew tired and asked us to shut her door. I only\npushed it to, and we continued talking, but less loudly. I can affirm that\nwe were all calm and unconcerned.\nIt was 9 o'clock, the night was quiet, the table was the only lighted spot\nin the room, a faint light could be seen in my mother's room through the\nanground glass doors.\nAll at once the wind seemed to rise and howl plaintively at the end of\nthe corridor. The corridor door, which is closed by a French handle, (bee de\ncane), opened violently, the two glass leaves came together with a crash. I\nlooked up, astonished at the sudden gust amidst the calm. Then something\nstrange and inexplicable happened. A shadow, like the shadow of a\nwoman, stood at the entrance of my mother's room ; it drew away from the\ncurtains and glided slowly towards the corridor. I saw it vaguely at first,\nbut more clearly when its profile was thrown up by the wall. When it\narrived at the angle formed by the wall at that place, it left the wall,\nadvanced into the room, and again turned towards the corridor. At that\nmoment it stood out clearly on the white background of the open door, it\nlooked to me perfect and distinct. It was the shadow of a woman, more\ncompact than transparent, and yet\u2014if I may so express myself\u2014it was\ndiaphanous as some clouds are.\n\f-\u00b150 F. W. H. Myers.\nIt was little, slightly bent, its head was bent, and its arms grossed over\nits breast ; a sort of resignation and reserve was expressed in its attitude.\nThe head and shoulders were covered by a sort of ashy grey veil, the face\nwas quite hidden, it might have been a nun. It entered the corridor and\ndisappeared into the darkness. A gust of wind, less violent than the first,\nclosed the door after it ; my mother's door had also closed noiselessly. The\nphenomenon lasted some seconds. I had thought of my mother directly,\nnot that there was any particular resemblance, but I had felt some\nmysterious connection between her and the apparition. I cannot analyse\nwhat I felt. It was not fear, it was astonishment mixed with a kind of\nsuperstitious alarm. I felt an immense sadness, my heart contracted, and\nI had a painful presentiment. I thought \" My mother will die.\" I looked\nat my brother anxiously, his face told me that he too had seen. M. Menon\nseemed ill at ease. I rose to go to my mother, and hesitated, fearing to\nfind her worse. Turning to M. Menon, I said, \"I once knew a Russian\nfamily, in which it had become almost a matter of belief that when a shadow\nleft the room of a sick person, he would die that same day, or very shortly.\"\n\"Do not let yourself be distressed,\" he replied, \"it was only a play of\nshadows, caused by a gust of wind most probably.\" I was not convinced,\nbut went into my mother's room. The light had gone out, which struck\nme. I relit it and found her dozing. I was obliged to wake her and ask her\nhow she was. She looked at me as if she had been dreaming, and\nanswered, '' I am not so well, I am in some pain. Let me sit up. . . ,\nlam oppressed. . . .\"I re-arranged her position, but being unable to\ncontrol myself any longer, I asked, \" Mamma, did you hear anything just\nnow?\" \"No, why?\" \" Don't you know ? We saw a shadow come out of\nyour room. \" She looked at me with vague interrogation. I could not keep\nfrom crying, and without thinking that my tears might trouble her, I asked,\n\" You are going to get well, to stay with us, to live a long time, are you\nnot?\" \" Yes,\" she said, \" yes, poor child. You are a baby to cry about a\nshadow. It all means nothing. Tell Valerie to bring my tisane.\"\nI went back to the dining room, and found that my brother had told\nValerie (my sister). She was surprised, but not as much impressed as I\nwas.\nMy brother and M. Menon took leave of my mother and went out, the\nformer not returning till late. That night my mother grew worse, and\ncontinued to do so.\nWe did not again speak about the apparition, and in a few days I ceased to\nthink of it.\nMy mother died on January 25th of the same year, between 9 and 10 in\nthe evening. One day when my brother and I were talking of her, \"That\nshadow,\" I said, \"was not altogether wrong, and my presentiment did not\ndeceive me.\" \" No,\" my brother replied, \" the more I think of it the less\nI understand it\u2014yet we really did see something.\"\nI have never had any other hallucination.\n2. Account of lhr. Isnard.\nIn 1878, I lived with my mother and sisters at the Rue Jacob. My\nmother had been in bed seriously ill for four months, when one evening,\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 451\nM. Menon dining with us, she expressed a wish to be present at the meal,\nby having the dixlr left open.\nOur apartments consisted of five rooms, three looking out on the Rue\nJacob, two (the dining room and my mother's room) on an inner yard. The\nevent occurred in these two. There were three doors in the dining room\u2014\nthat of the antechamber, my mother's (a glass folding door), and the third,\nwhich was closed by a bee de cane, led by a passage into the front rooms.\nThe night was quiet, it was about 9 or 9.30. We were calm, and almost\nreassured by the improvement in my mother's health.\nOur conversation at last seemed to fatigue the invalid, and she asked us\nto close the door. We set it to, and went on talking.\nSuddenly the door of the corridor opened wide, the leaves of my\nmother's door clashed and then opened, and the wind rose. I thought it odd\nthere should be a gust of wind, when all the windows were shut. I looked\nabout, and saw between the curtains which surrounded my mother's door,\nthe shadow of a woman, small, bent, with head bent forward, and arms\ncrossed on the bosom. A dusty grey veil seemed to cover it, so that it\nlooked like a nun. It came softly into the room, gliding over the floor, in\nthe same attitude ; the face was invisible. It passed close to me, out of the\ndoor, and disappeared in the darkness of the passage. A second gust of\nwind closed the doors. The whole thing lasted six or seven seconds.\nI did not feel fear, but we were all three embarrassed. We had seen the\nsame thing, and did not dare to admit it to one another. My sister was\nparticularly affected.\n\"It was nothing, mademoiselle,\" said M. Menon, \"it was a play of\nshadows. Do not be disturbed.\" My sister said she had known a Russian\nfamily who believed that when a shadow went out of an invalid's room, he\nwould die that day, or certainly before long. She then went to my mother.\nMy youngest sister, who had been absent, returned, and seemed greatly\nsurprised at what we told her.\nMy friend and I went out together. When I returned I found my\nmother much worse.\nWhat astonishes me to this day is that though our minds were full of the\napparition, we avoided any mention of it.\nNext week, I was alone with my mother. She had been sitting in the\ndining-room for some minutes. My sisters were out. It was 5 o'clock, the\ntime when Dr. D. generally came. I had never been alone with him. Being\na medical student, I suspected that my mother's state was serious, and I had\nnot courage to receive the sentence of death. So that when he came, I\ndeclined to go to the door. My mother rose, and at that moment I was\nstruck by her attitude. It was that of the shadow we had seen. She\nadvanced slowly towards the door, little and bent. Her head and shoulders\nwere covered by a shawl and her face was invisible ; her arms were crossed\nover her chest.\nMy mother died on the 25th of January, at 9.30.\nI give you the facts as they are, without attempting to explain them.\nDr. Isnard.\n15, Boulevard Arago.\n\f452 F. W. H. Myers.\n3. Account of M. Menon-Cormtet.\nAt the beginning of January, 1878, I went to see my friend, Dr. Isnard,\nof No. 28, Rue Jacob, and to enquire after his mother who had been for\nsome time dangerously ill. I was asked to dinner, and MUes Isnard, their\nbrother, and I dined in a room next to that of the invalid. Towards the\nend of the meal the youngest sister went to the kitchen. The door of Mme\nIsnard's room was put to, but not closed. It was near the right corner of\nthe dining-room and was close to another door which communicated with the\ndrawing-room by means of a passage. These doors were at right angles with\none another ; both were pushed to, but not hasped ; at least the glass door\ninto Mme Isnard's room was not. M. Isnard and I could both see these doors,\none on the right and the other on the left, and MUe Isnard faced the angle\nformed by the two doors. We all distinctly saw a shadow glide from the\ninvalid's door to the door communicating with the corridor, following the\nangle. This shadow looked like a woman with a very long veil, like a nun ;\nits head was bent. It seemed to me to grow less and less distinct, and on\nreaching the door leading to the drawing-room, it disappeared. It seemed\nto disappear through the floor. At this moment the two doors, which had\nopened suddenly and simultaneously before the shadow passed, returned\nquickly and simultaneously to their original positions, striking loudly against\ntheir doorposts. The passing of the figure and the closing of the doors took\nabout 6 or 7 seconds.\nEach of us at first believed that he or she alone had been hallucinated,\nbut we were of course obliged to abandon this hypothesis. When the\nyounger M1Ie Isnard came back she was told what had occurred, and could\nnot believe it. She had not left the kitchen in the meantime. I went and\nlooked out of the only window of the dining-room to see if there were any\npossibility of a shadow having been cast through it, but there was no lighted\nwindow on the same floor as ours, in the buildings opposite our apartment.\nWe were on the third floor, looking out on the yard ; there were several\nwindows below slightly lighted, and there was a gas lamp in the yard, but\nthis was 7 or 8 yards below, exactly under our window. Neither was it\npossible that a shadow should have been thrown through either of the dining-\nroom doors. It appeared impossible to us that any effect of light could have\nproduced what we had seen, and we gave up our attempts at a satisfactory\nexplanation.\nMme Isnard died some days after, and it is only since her death that we\nhave sometimes talked of the mysterious apparition.\nG. Menon-Cornuet.\n22, Rue do Constantinople,\nParis, November 1oth, 1890.\n4. Attestation of M. Josset.\nI, the undersigned, certify that Dr. Isnard, one of my intimate friends,\nrelated to me ten years ago the curious case of the passing of a shadow in\nhis rooms, simultaneously observed by three persons. He told me that the\nshadow exactly resembled his mother, who was then dangerously ill, and\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 453\ndied a few days after. We have often spoken of this fact, which we believed\nto be absolutely unique ; and Dr. Isnard's story has never varied.\nL. Josset,\n6, Boulevard Arago, Paris. Chemist of the First Class.\n5. Witness of Mlu V. Isnard.\nI remember perfectly that when I came back to the dining-room, my\nbrother told me what all three had seen. I have just read their accounts,\nj and can certify that the facts related there are exactly as they were told me\ndirectly after the event. y iSnard\nObservations fbom Dr. Dariex, Editor of Annates Psychufues.\nWe have before us the extract from the certificate of death of Mme Isnard,\ndraw up on the 26th January, 1878 ; we extract the following passage :\n\"Marie-Josephine de Boussois, Rentiere, died at her domicile, 28, Rue\nJacob, yesterday (that is on the 25th January, 1878) at 11 o'clock at night,\n.... widow of Jean-Augustin Isnard . . . .\"\nTherefore Madame Isnard died on January 25th, 1878, as we have always\nbeen told.\nAlthough the witnessess of this strange phenomenon are our intimate\nfriends ; though we cannot possibly doubt their sincerity, and though we\nknow that they related the story to their friends, ten years ago, when they\nknew nothing of psychical phenomena, we have visited the rooms where it\nhappened, in order to see if some natural explanation were not possible.\nAfter a minute examination of the house and the rooms, we have been\nobliged to acknowledge that no natural shadow could have been accidentally\nprojected on the spot where the appearance was observed, and that none of\nthe witnesses could have been mistaken on the point.\nThis hypothesis is also corroborated by the strange resemblance between\nthe shadow and the invalid, who had the same figure, the same dress, and\nthe same attitude ; and this argues in favour of the psychical character of\nthe phenomenon.\nNone of the witnesses is subject to hallucinations or has had another in\nhis life.\nThe younger daughter of M1\"e Isnard, who was in the kitchen at the\ntime, and whose shadow could have not been projected into the dining-room,\nwas 16 centimetres taller than her mother ; she had besides no veil on her\nhead, and her shadow, even admitting that it could have been seen there,\ncould not in any way have resembled the one seen.\nBesides, this particular shadow was not so dark as projected shadows are;\nDr. Isnard compares it to spider's web.\nM. Menon and MUe Isnard saw it in profile on the doors and walls, as if\nit had been thrown there ; Dr. Isnard saw it in space, clearly detached, and\nobjective ; to him, it hid what was behind it, as an object more or less\ntransparent might do. When the position of the places, the path taken by\nthe shadow, and the respective positions of the witnesses are studied, it is\neasy to perceive that it must, or at least may have been so, even if the form\nwas really objective : M. Isnard was placed rather near the glass door and\n\f454 F. W. H. Myers.\nperpendicularly to it ; the shadow, coming out of the glass door to reach the\nangle and the corridor door, must have at first come straight towards him,\nso that it was easy for him to see it in space ; for at the point it started from\nand for about a yard of its path, he could not have seen it projected into the\ndinmg-room ; he would have seen it projected on the wall of the bedroom,\nabout six yards off.\nOn the other hand, M\"e Isnard and M. Menon, placed farther from the\nangle and from the door, could not see the shadow coming towards them, and\nwhen they looked at the figure, their gaze, instead of meeting the empty\nspace in the bedroom, would have fallen on the opening of the glass door, on\nthe angle of the two walls, and on the door of the corridor, at that moment\nwide open.\nThus, (and we insist on this point) the different way in which the shadow\nwas seen by the witnesses seems to depend on their positions in regard to\nthe path of the figure, and this difference favours the theory of its objectivity.\nHowever, we should not dare to conclude that the apparition was really\nobjective and that the three percipients really saw the phantasm or double\nof the invalid. But we draw attention to the following six points :\u2014\n1. A strange and unforeseen phenomenon was spontaneously and simul\ntaneously observed in the same manner by the three persons present, whose\nattention was first drawn to it by a gust of wind.\n2. MUe Isnard found her mother asleep directly after.\n3. The shadow resembled the invalid and walked like her.\n4. The invalid felt worse at once, grew steadily worse, and died a few\ndays after.\n5. No real shadow could have taken the path of the shadow which was\nseen.\n6. The gust of wind occurred in a time of complete calm, when the\nwindows were shut.\nAgain, the witnesses observed no movement of the air, as they would\nwith a real gust of wind.\nSome movement of the air might however have passed unobserved on\naccount of the disturbed state of the witnesses. t-v , ,_\nApart from the collectivity of the percipience, another new point,\nit will be observed, is here involved. If this phantom was really a\nmessage from the decedent's spirit implying that death was near, the\ncircumstances suggest that that spirit must also have been able to\ndiscern a scene in the remaining earth-life which ordinary inference\ncould not have foretold. We pass in fact, at this point, from organic\nprevision to a prevision of future incidents of life, of which there will\nbe much to say later on.\nBut before directly facing this main problem, it will be well to lead\nup to it by another indirect route\u2014namely, through certain apparent\nacts of prevision which seem to be at least partly explicable by\ntelepathy. In the cases\u2014as yet few\u2014where there has been anything\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 455\nlike a series of telepathic messages, some element of apparent pre\ndiction has generally been included ; although probably often\nresolvable into a mere conversion of the agent's expectation and\ninference into what looks to the percipient like an actual reality.\nThe following telepathic diary\u2014which we have not been able to\npersuade Dr. and Mrs. S. to renew\u2014illustrates this slight want\nof contemporaneity.\nP. 169. From the Pacific Theosvphist, San Francisco,\nAugust, 1893.\nThe following experiments were conducted by a well-known physician of\nthis City and his wife. Both were somewhat interested in the subject and,\nupon the latter leaving for a visit in the country, it was arranged that at a\ncertain time of each day ten minutes should be devoted to an attempt to\ncommunicate telepathically, each alternating as transmitter and receiver.\nThe notes, carefully written down while separated nearly a hundred miles,\nspeak for themselves. They also make it apparent that the physician accom\nplished something more than mere telepathy. In receiving supposed mes\nsages, he several times got accurate information of things which the wife had\nno idea she was imparting and in one or two instances actually foresaw\noccurrences which could not possibly have been known to his transmitter.\nThis shows how intimately our psychic senses blend one with the other, and\nhow hard it is for an untrained person to distinguish just what psychic\nfaculty is active. The phenomena recorded are commonplace in their char\nacter ; the interest lies in their truthfulness and the scientific accuracy of\ntheir observation.

The experiments throw much light on psychic faculties other than\nmere telepathy.\nJ. S., M.D., Physician and Surgeon.\nSan Francisco, November 29th, 1893.\nR Hodgson, Esq ,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014In reply to yours of November 15th,\nmy statement is that my experiment with my wife in telepathy resulted pre\ncisely as you find it given in the Pacific Theosophist. [In a later letter Dr.\nS. states that he is not himself a Theosophist.]\nI came to try the experiment this way : I read in the daily papers of a\ncertain drummer who, when absent from his home, made it a practice to sit\nat ten o'clock p.m., for about half an hour, his wife the same, and mentally\ncommunicate the news of the day to each other, as exchanging letters was\ninconvenient, he being compelled to change his location every day.\nAs my wife was to go away from San Francisco last summer with a sick\nsister of hers, we decided to try the experiment, with the result given in the\nPacific Tlieosophist. My wife has grown up in an atmosphere of scepticism,\nconsequently she did not give the subject as much attention as I did,\notherwise we might have had better results. Now, of course, her personal\nexperience convinced her of something.\nNo third person was aware of our doing, excepting what I state here : I\nmet Dr. J. Anderson in consultation about a patient, when I told him I\nbelieved in the possibilities of telepathy, and that I was making experiments\njust then with my wife. He asked me to Rhow him the result, good or\nbad, which I did. Dr. Anderson never met my wife, neither did he\nknow where she went to. She was in St. Helena, Sonoma County, about\n63 miles from the city.\nWe agreed to sit twenty minutes at ten o'clock p.m. In sending news, I\nfixed my mind strongly on the messages, in receiving I made my mind as\nnear blank as I could, excluding all thought. Everything I received came to\nme as a mental picture. Sometimes I would see things only partly, like half\nof a face. When I saw her arm, with the poison oak, it came very clearly.\nI almost thought I could speak to her, but I never heard anything like noise.\n\f458 F. W. H. Myers.\nThe only other experiments I tried were several years ago in mind-reading.\nOne party would fix his mind on a certain card, and I would tell him which\none it was. I succeeded once out of every three attempts. Some days I could\ntell correctly four or five times in succession, other times I failed altogether.\n1 tried the experiments for my own personal satisfaction, having no desire\nto attract notice whatever. 1 may also add that I found that a quiet mind\nand rested condition of the system is necessary for success.\nI don't wish my name to be published, but if anybody should enquire of\nyou privately, the same as you did of Dr. Anderson, I have no objection to-\nyou giving them my name and address.\nWishing you success in your labours, I remain, yours, jjr J g\nI corroborate the above statement in every detail. Una E S\nMr. W. E. Coleman, well-known to Dr. Hodgson, writes to him as follows :\nChief Q.M. Office, San Francisco, California,\nDecember 21st, 1893.\nUpon enquiry I find that Dr. J. S. is a reputable physician of character\nand standing. All speak well of him, and he is considered a man of veracity.\nI can find nothing against him as man or as doctor. j, (j^^^\nI add a few cases of scenes apparently prefigured, where the pre-\nfigurement may simply have been a telepathic transference of an,\nanticipation existing in another mind. J\nHere is a trivial premonition, which may have had its rise in an.\nexisting intention on the caller's part to offer to show the slides,\ntelepathically transferred to Dr. Smith. It is an evidential weat\nthat Dr. Smith had not told the dream before the offer was made.\nP. 187.\nFrom Dr. Henry Smith, Associate S.P.R., toE. T. Bennett, (enclosing \"B.\">\nCravensea, Cockington, Torquay,\nApril 13th, 1894.\nDear Sib,\u2014Many strange facts occur which with our present knowledge\nare unaccountable. I will give you one.\nOn Friday night, 6th inst. , I had a very vivid dream. I dreamt I called\non a gentleman on business matters. He asked me to look at a number of\ntransparent photographic slides. I sat down and much enjoyed the views.\nThey were remarkably fine and so impressed themselves on my memory that,\nduring the day, I could distinctly see the streets and buildings.\nOn Saturday evening, 7th inst., Mr. Winget, my printer, called on me. In\nthe course of conversation he said : \" I see you are interested in Egyptian\nbuildings\u2014I have lately purchased a very fine collection of transparent\nphotographic slides. I have four sets\u2014Egypt, Palestine, The Rhine, and\nParis\u2014also a very fine stereoscopic cabinet. I should have great pleasure in\nshewing them to you, if you will kindly come up to my house.\"\nI listened with surprise to what he said, and when he was gone I\nremarked to my children, \" Did you hear what Mr. Winget said ? I was too\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 459\nmuch astonished to make any remark to him on the subject.\" I then told\nthem my dream.\nOn Sunday evening following, I went to Mr. Winget's house, and there\nto my astonishment stood the very box and its surroundings I had seen in\nmy dream. I sat down and looked over twenty or more slides, then got up\nand said, \" I will look at no more ! \" for there I saw the identical views I\nhad seen in my dream.\nWhat theory will account for this fact ? This was not dreaming of some\nthing that had taken place, but most vividly of something that was to take\n, Pi**.\u2014Yours truly, Hekhy Smith.\n\"B.\" (enclosure). Cravensea, Torquay,\nApril 19th, 1894.\nI was in the room with my sisters when Mr. Winget invited my father\nto go to his house to look at some transparent slides, illustrating Paris,\nEgypt, etc.\nImmediately Mr. Winget left, my father exclaimed, \"I was so astonished\nat what Mr. Winget said, that I could not answer him ! He has most\ngraphically described my dream\u2014this is most extraordinary !\u2014I will accept\nthe invitation.\"\nMy father went, and found everything exactly as he had seen in the\ndream\u2014the chair, window, and other surrounding objects\u2014as well as the\ncabinet and slides. \u2022\nI may add that we had noticed how remarkably quiet my father became\nwhen Mr. Winget mentioned the slides.\nAda Smith.\nAnnie Smith.\nPhosbe Maud Smith.\nObserve that if Dr. Smith had less distinctly observed that his\nthought of the slides preceded the offer to show them, that offer might\nhave given the characteristic feeling of promnesia,\u2014as of the repetition\nof something previously rehearsed. It has already been suggested that\nthe promnesic sensation may sometimes thus be at bottom a form of\ntelepathy.\nHere is another case, where the warning of danger may have been\na telepathic impact from the mind of the assassin, as he heard the\napproach of his intended victim.\nP. 173.\nFour years ago, I made arrangements with my nephew, John W.\nParsons, to go to my office after supper to investigate a case. We walked along\ntogether, both fully determined to go up into the office, but just as I stepped\nupon the door sill of the drug store, in which my office was situated, some\ninvisible influence stopped me instantly. I was much surprised, felt like I\nwas almost dazed, the influence was so strong, almost like a blow, I felt like\nI could not make another step. I said to my nephew, \"John, I do not feel\nlike going into the office now, you go and read Flint and Aitkin on the\nsubject.\" He went, lighted the lamp, took off his hat, and just as he was\nk*..\n\f460 F. W. H. Myers.\nreaching for a book the report of a large pistol was heard. The ball entered\nthe window near where he was standing, passed near to and over his head,\nstruck the wall and fell to the floor. Had I been standing where he was, I\nwould have been killed, as I am much taller than he. The pistol was fired\nby a man who had an old grudge against me, and had secreted himself in a\nvacant house near by to assassinate me.\nThis impression was unlike any that I ever had before. All my former\nimpressions were slow in their development, grew stronger and stronger,\nuntil the maximum was reached. I did not feel that I was in any danger,\nand could not understand what the strong impression meant. The fellow\nwas drunk, had been drinking for two weeks. If my system had been in a\ndifferent condition\u2014I had just eaten supper\u2014I think I would have received\nalong with the impression some knowledge of the character of the danger,\nand would have prevented my nephew from going into the office.\nI am fully satisfied that the invisible and unknown intelligence did the\nbest that could have been done, under the circumstances, to save us from\nharm- D. J. Parsons, M.D., Sweet Springs, Mo.\n(The above account was received in a letter from Dr. D. J. Parsons,\ndated December 15th, 1891.)\nStatement of Dr. J. W. Parsons.\nAbout four years ago my uncle. Dr. D. J. Parsons, and I were going to\nsupper, when a man halted us and expressed a desire for medical advice.\nMy uncle requested him to call the next morning, and as we walked along he\nsaid the case was a bad one and that we would come back after supper and\ngo to the office and examine the authorities on the subject. After supper\nwe returned, walked along together on our way to the office, but just as we\nreached the door of the drug store he very unexpectedly, to me, stopped\nsuddenly, which caused me to stop too ; we stood there together a few\nseconds, and he remarked to me that he did not feel like going into the office\nthen, or words to that effect, and told me to go and examine Flint and\nAitkin. I went, lit the lamp, and just as I was getting a book, a pistol was\nfired into the office, the ball passing close to my head, struck the East wall,\nthen the North, and fell to the floor.\nThis 5th day of July, 1891.\nJohn W. Parsons, [Ladonia, Texas.]\nI have spoken of these last cases as explicable by telepathy, or\nsupernormal perception of the contents of a distant mind;\u2014and of\nsome previous cases as explicable by telesthesia, or supernormal\nperception of matter at a distance, without any assignable influence of\nanother mind. Of course, however, we cannot broadly distinguish\nfrom each other obscure faculties such as these. For aught we know,\nthere may be a higher point of view from which these two types of\nconnaissance sup\u00e9rieure may be fused in one. We need not, then, be\nsurprised if we find cases where the two faculties, if we can so term\nthem, meet,\u2014as where some disposition of material objects seems to\nfacilitate a transference of thought.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 461\nWe have had some curious instances of this kind, where the\nactual touch of some object which had belonged to a deceased person\nseemed, in Mrs. Piper's trances, to facilitate communication from\nthat person.\nAnd, somewhat similarly, keeping to matters within our present\nscope, we have already published several cases where a letter in course\nof passage through the post seems to have been cognised by its intended\nrecipient before delivery. Sometimes a knowledge of the letter's\ni content is thus transmitted ; sometimes the outside only is prefigured,\nperhaps with postmarks which the writer himself has not seen. It\nlooks as though the current of the writer's thought had directed his\nintended reader's supernormal perception to some sight of the actual\nmaterial letter then on its way to him. I quote two cases of this type.\nM.C1. 92.

Something engaged my attention at the end\nof the room, and standing with my back to the table I said ; \"Are there any\nletters for me, A. ? \" (The letters are usually on or by my plate. )\nA. \"Yes, one; there is one. \"\n[Mrs. Venn.] \"See who it's from ; do you know ? \"\nA- \"It has the Deal postmark; it is from Frances (Venn)\u2014for you\nor me.\"\nTurning round I saw no letter, and said : \"I see no letter, A.

I dreamed a dream and\nwoke with it, and he immediately (asleep still) in his sleep began to talk\nabout it, proving that he was dreaming the same thing. It was a very queer\ndream, and involved the question of how many inches (of a row of candles)\nshould be cut off each candle. He gravely begged me to \" cut off six inches,\ndo, mamma \" ; when I was feeling four would be enough. It was a fete in\nour dream, and we were lighting up some room. No real thing had\nhappened to suggest it to us, but we both dreamt it together apparently.\nCompare the following case from a percipient known to Dr.\nHodgson.\nP. 163. 2024, Lexington Avenue, New York,\nFebruary 17th, 1893.\nAbout two weeks ago, I think on the night of the 3rd inst., I dreamed\nthat I was going to a place called Pontegardo. I remembered the name dis\ntinctly on awaking, but it seemed so \"outlandish \" and queer, I did not\nthink that it could be a real name. I asked my mother if she knew of a place\nwith such a name. She said that she did not. Three or four days after that\nI received a letter from my husband, who is in Florida, saying that he would\nprobably go to Puntagardo. This letter was written either the day preced\ning my dream, or the day after.\nPhebe L. Griffing [Associate S.P.R.]\nAs related above, my daughter-in-law asked me, the morning after her\ndream, if I knew of a place called Pontegardo. I did not know of such a\nplace until my son's letter was received, saying that he thought of going\nthere. Jane R. Griffing.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 403\n2024, Lexington Avenue, New York,\nFebruary 21st, 1893.\nDear Mb. Hodgson,\u2014 .... My daughter-in-law has the letter\nreferring to Puntagardo, but as it is principally about personal affairs, she\ndoes not like to send it. Charley writes of a business project which, if he\ncarries it out, will make Phebe's dream premonitory, as they will go there\nto live. If this should be the result, it will be one of the clearest of pre\nmonitions, as when she received the letter, nothing of the kind had been\ncontemplated. There was only an intention on Charley's part to remain in\n' Jacksonville, or go to Tallahassee to take charge of a newspaper office.\nThese two plans were in Phebe's mind, and she had no idea of any other plan.\nJane R. Grifping.\nAnd here we find a point of transition to a new group of cases, in\nwhich foreknowledge of similar type comes from a definite mind, of\nwhich, however, we cannot clearly determine whether it is the\npercipient's own mind or a mind external to her, and unembodied.\nMy first example comes from Mr. W., the friend of Dr. Hodgson's,\nfrom whom a case has above been cited.\nP. 150. October 26fA, 1894.\nDear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014As you are well aware, I have been for a number\nof years an automatic writer, so-called. The following is an account of an\nexperience I had last April.\nIn the afternoon, I was riding eastward towards Schenectady, N.Y., on\nthe N.Y.C. and H.R. road. I intended to get off at Schenectady, and take\na train from there to Troy, and at Troy to get a train on the Fitchburgh and\nHoosac Tunnel Road. I asked the conductor whether I would be able to\nmake good connections at Schenectady, also at Troy. He informed me that\nI would at Schenectady, but at Troy I would not, for the reason that I would\nnot arrive in Troy until five minutes after the departure of the train on the\nF. and H. T. He told me that I would not arrive in Troy until 5. 5. and\nmy train departed at just five o'clock, and that it was the last one for the\nweek. This was Saturday. I asked him if he could suggest any way for\nme to get the train or reach my desired place of destination, but he said he\ncould not. It seemed certain that I must lay off in Troy over Sunday.\nThe conductor passed on, and I meditated, but to no purpose. After some\ntime I took a pencil and paper, and thought, but did not write, \" Well, I\nthink I shall not get through to-night, I am very sorry.\" Instantly the\npencil wrote, \"You will reach to-night,\" naming the place I was\nbound for. I replied, by thought, \"Why, it's impossible, how can I ?\u2014the\ntrain out of Troy leaves five minutes before my train arrives.\" The answer\nwas, \" Yes, but you will get to to-night,\" again naming my place of\ndestination. Again I thought, \"Pray tell me how I am to do so.\" The\nanswer was, \" Oh, never mind how, I tell you you will arrive in all\nright to-night.\" I urged the impossibility of the matter, but that was\nstoutly denied. I pleaded for an explanation, but it was written that I needed\nnone, and that none would be given me. I asked for instruction and it was\n2 l 2\n\f464 F. W. H. Myers.\nwritten that they had none to give. I insisted on the fact that I could not\nget the train, but this was not conceded.\nOn arriving at Schenectady I found my train for Troy, and as I boarded\nit, I asked the trainman if we would arrive in Troy in time for me to g\u00abt a\ntrain on the Fitchburgh and Hoosac Tunnel Road. He replied \" No\" very\npromptly, and added, \" it leaves five minutes before we arrive.\" I took my\nseat. When the conductor came along I tried hard to appear innocent, and\nasked him if I would get to Troy in time to get a train out on the Fitchburg\nand Hoosac Tunnel Road. I said I hoped to, for I was very anxious to\narrive at that night. His reply was, \" We do not arrive in Troy until\nfive minutes after five, and the train on that road pulls out at just five and\nit's the last train.\" He passed on picking up tickets and I settled back into\nmy seat. It seemed as if the last chance was gone, and I could not help\nbut wonder what would be written, so I observed mentally, \" Well, you see\nyour prediction is wrong, do you not '? \" And then came to me what seemed\nto be the height of foolishness, \" Why, you will get there all right, just as\nI told you.\" No explanation being vouchsafed, I fell to planning what\nI would do in the city of Troy over Sunday, for I had no hope of\ngetting out.\nAfter a while the conductor came back and took a seat just behind me,\nand leaning over towards me he said, \" So you would very much like to get\nthat train, would you?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I said. \"Well,\" continued he,\n\" there is just one way that is possible for you to do it, if you are a good\nrunner and willing to take chances.\" Of course I asked how. Said he, \"I\ndon't advise anyone to do it, but it is possible to jump off this train, for we\nstop before we reach the Troy Dep6t, and run and jump on to that train while\nit is going out.\" And he took a pencil and drew the railroads and the\ndepot (a Union one) about like this :\u2014\nTroy\nDepot.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 465\nAnd then he went on to explain : \" We are not allowed to run into the\ndepSt untU the train for Saratoga and the one ou the Fitchbnrgh and H. T.R.\nhave both pulled out, which they both do at just five o'clock. We should\narrive at our stopping place X at about five. You could get off there and\nrun across the Saratoga track and over to Z and jump on to that train.\nThere is a street from a point near X to Z.\"\nAt X, as our train stopped, I jumped from it and ran to point Z and\ncaught my train which was passing at that point.\nWhen seated in the car I gave the pencil one more chance and it was\nwritten : \"I see you are on board all right ; don't you think I knew what I\nwas telling you ? \"\nI had no further trouble in reaching the desired place that night.\nI will say that I was not aware of any of the material facts prior to their\nappearing as I have stated them. I had not consulted any time-table or\notherwise learned as to the times on which these trains were to arrive or\ndepart : and I knew nothing of the train stopping outside the Troy Depot or of\nthe possibility of getting from it and running up the street and catching the\ntrain I wished to take. I never had the slightest idea of such a thing until\nthe conductor laid the plan before me just as I have stated it. I was\ntravelling alone. I did not know the conductor or anybody that I saw.\nI had no occasion to look up or inform myself as to trains at Troy for\nthe reason that I expected to travel on the West Shore Road instead of the\nN.Y.C. and H.R.R. ; but I missed the train on the West Shore Road and so\ntook the N.Y.C. and H.R.R. as the best thing possible under the circum\nstances. On the West Shore Road my journey would not have been through\nSchenectady and Troy but would have been to Rotterdam Junction on the\nWest Shore Road and there I would have connected with a train on the\nFitchburgh and Hoosac Tunnel Road, all very nicely.\nI think this experience is quite unique. Perhaps some one can explain it.\nW.\nN.Y. November 8th, 1894.\nIn accordance with your suggestion, I send you herewith a further\nstatement that you may subjoin. I think it covers your enquiry.\nC . W .\nAbout two years prior to that I had travelled from Schenectady to Troy,\nand out of Troy on F. and H. T. R. ; but at that time the train did not\nstop outside of Troy Depot. I had travelled in years previous, that is, from 5\nto 20 years ago, several times on trains between Schenectady and Troy,\nbut none of them ever stopped outside of Troy Depot. I had not been in\nsince the trip of two years before. Prior to that I had been in that\nplace perhaps once in two years, for a day.\nIt might be well to add that no friend of mine at or elsewhere\nknew any of these facts, to the best of my knowledge and belief. After\narriving at I told my friends, but none of them had known of the\nmatters. I feel confident that no friend or acquaintance of mine knew I\nwas to travel from Schenectady to Troy, and that none of them had made\nor heard of a connection in that way. From talks with them I know they\ndid not.\n\f466 F. W. H. Myers.\nAmong our best attested cases of foreknowledge of a letter's arrival\nwas one communicated by Dr. Ermacora, of Padua, and printed\nVol. IX., p. 68.\nAs the readers of Dr. Ermacora's article in Proceedings, Vol. XI.,\nare aware, that very careful observer has not yet been able to\ndecide whether the \" mediumistic personality \" which calls itself\nElvira is a separate entity, or merely a modification of the medium's\nown mind. There is, in fact, much the same perplexity as in\nanother case which has been long and carefully observed,\u2014the\nproblem, namely, as to the identity of the so-called Phinuit with\nMrs. Piper.\nWhatever Elvira may be, she possesses certain supernormal powers\nwhich for us are perhaps the more instructive in that their scope is\nsomewhat narrowly limited. Among these powers Elvira claims\n'precognition ;\u2014admittedly on what may be termed a puny scale, and\ndealing with trivial matters, but nevertheless involving some real know\nledge of the coming course of events, and of the part which human\nactions, apparently free, will play therein. The question now before us\nis whether Elvira's apparent foreknowledge may not be explained as\ninference from a slightly wider knowledge of the present, combined\nwith a power of suggestion exercised not only upon Maria Manzini\nherself, (which on any hypothesis is obviously probable), but even upon\nstrangers.1 Dr. Ermacora, as will be seen, has kept these points in\nmind ; and his conclusion is that Elvira has shown some foreknowledge\nof events, paltry indeed in themselves, but yet such as suggestion can\nhardly be pressed to cover. (See the incident of sale of pawn-tickets,\nand others, in Bivista di Studi Psichici, 1895). The question will\nthen be,\u2014and these trivial incidents may help us quite as well as\nmore important ones towards its solution,\u2014whether that supernormal\nknowledge of actually existing thoughts and things with which Elvira\nmust at any rate be credited (Proceedings, Vol. IX, p. 68) may be\nenough to suggest by mere forward-looking inference,\u2014itself perhaps\nsupernormally acute,\u2014the events foretold in the two following and\nsome similar cases. The case first given would be easily explained\nif there were collusion between Maria Manzini, and Linda Bigoni.\nDr. Emacora, however, is satisfied of the probity of Maria Manzini\nwho, as previously stated, has been well known to him for some\nyears.\n1 At this paragraph passes through the press, I hear from Dr. Emacora that Elvira\nhas made a prediction involving a mistake to be made by Maria in cutting out some\ngarments, and has then withdrawn it, as not wishing that Maria should thus waste\nthe stuff, and resolving to influence her not to make the mistake. Elvira herself,\ntherefore, admits that she can influence the so-called predictions by suggestions of\nher own.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 467\nP. 211.\nPremonition of an Incident at the Caffe Nazionale at Padua.\nPercipient, Maria Manzini.\nOn the 7th of April, 1894, at 9.30 p.m., Signa Maria Manzini was in the\nsomnambulistic state. The personality called Adriano manifested sensorially\n(hallucinations). He asked me to suggest to M. to pay attention to the\ndream she would have during the night, and to record it at once in the\nproper book, as it would be premonitory.\nI went to see Signa Maria the next day, and found the following note in\nthe register of dreams.\n\" Night of April 7-8, 1894. I dreamed that I was in the street, and\nthat, being very warm, I went into a Caff\u00e9 to rest. It seemed to be the Caff\u00e9\nat the bridge of San Lorenzo. I took some trifle, but when I wanted to pay\nfor it (I found), to my great surprise, that I had forgotten my purse and had\nnot a farthing. I was confused and to frightened and ashamed at not being\nable to pay that I woke.\n\"Padua, April 8th, 8 a.m. Maria Manzini.\"\nI questioned Signa Maria, to get more details, but it was not much use.\nI immediately wrote the following note at the foot of hers. \" M. says the\nCaflo was the one now called the Caff\u00e9 Nazionale. The occurrence took\nplace about 9.30 or 10 a.m. ; she does not remember the date. It was fine\nand warm weather. She did not see any one else in the CafK, and does not\nremember how she was dressed, nor what she drank.\"\nApril 8th, 10.50 p.m.\nOn the evening of April 9th, Signa Maria told me she had passed a restless\nnight and had slept little, and that she had heard a voice which told her to\npay attention to the continuation of the dream on the following night. I\nfound this hallucination also properly recorded in the register by Signa Maria.\nOn April 10th, instead of the record of the continued dream, I found the\nfollowing note :\u2014\n\"Night of April 9-10, 1894. This night the voice again whispered\nthe words I had heard the night before, although I had gone to bed with the\nintention of saying what Dr. E. had told me to say.\n\" I may have said it between sleeping and waking ; I remember distinctly\nthat the same voice replied ' I understand.'\n\" Padua, April lOtfc, 1894, 8 a.m. M. Manzini.\"\n[I must explain that Signa Maria had not recognised the voice the first\ntime. I thought it was Adriano who had hallucinated her, but did not say\nso. Now, as Adriano had fixed the night of the 10th for one of the experi\nments with telepathic dreams, and as I wished to put it off till the 11th, and\nas none of the mediumistic personalities had in the meantime given me an\nopportunity to propose the delay, I had thought of profiting by Adriano's\nnocturnal manifestation, if it were repeated ; and had charged Signa Maria\nto make the proposal if she heard the voice again. This second time Signa\nM. recognised Adriano's voice ; i.e., the voice he assumes in her dreams.]\nOn the evening of the 11th Signa M. told me she had had the promised\ncontinuation of the dream. She had noted as follows, directly on rising :\u2014\n\f468 F. W. H. Myers.\n\" Night of April 10-11, 1894. I dreamed I was in the CafR Nazionale,\nat the bridge of San Lorenzo, and that T was confused and did not know what\nto say to the waiter, because I had not a farthing. At that moment I looked\ninto the street and saw an acquaintance, Linda Bigoni, passing. I called\nher, and as she had money she got me out of the difficulty.\n\"Padua, April 11th, 1894, 8 a.m. M. Manzixi.\"\nI omit the last half of the preceding note, as it concerns another dream.\nWe still had not been told on what day, nor with certainty on what hour,\nthe double dream would be realised. On April 14th I went with Professor\nFaifofer and Signor Faido, to see Signa Maria, and Elvira manifested. I\nasked her if she could possibly furnish the dates. She said she did not know\nthem, but that she would go and find out if we could wait a few moments.\nThis she did, and returned to say that the dream would be realised on May\n30th following, between 10 and 11 a.m.\nAs Sig\"a Maria was seriously indisposed at this time, the manifestations\nof the different secondary personalities were very rare and irregular, and\nconsequently I had no opportunity to consult them about the present pre\ndiction. But on the evening of May 28th, Elvira manifested and said she\nwould return the next night to give me further particulars about the dream.\nShe said it would be realised on the 31st instant. I remarked at once that\nthe 30th had been predicted, but she insisted on its being the 31st : that she\nhad announced it for that day, and she called to witness the two men who\nhad been present at her communication of April 14th.\nNext evening she manifested as she had promised, but she had little more\nto add. She repeated the prediction in the following terms. She did not\ndictate, but I copy the note I took the same evening, textually (consequently\ntwo days before the fulfilment). My note is founded upon notes taken on\nthe spot, and is therefore almost equivalent to notes written from dictation.\nMay 29th, 5 p.m.\n\" Elvira re-affirms that the realization will take place on the 31st. In\nspite of my notes, which indicate the 30th, she is sure she said the 31st\nbefore the two men who were present (Prof. Faifofer and Signor Faido), and\nsays that their testimony may be appealed to.1 To my repeated question,\nshe replied that the time would be 10 a.m.\n\"I asked her to tell me everything she knows. She says that at that hour\nM. will pass the spot, will be hot and tired, and will enter the Caffe' and\norder a glass.\"\n\"Q. Of what?\n\" A. I don't know ; I can tell you to-morrow night.\n\" M. will also eat a cake, and will then look in vain for her purse. She\nwill be annoyed and confused, and will think of offering the waiter one of\nher earrings. She will look out to see if any acquaintance passes. It will\nbe arranged that the person she dreamed of shall pass, and M will call\nher in. She also will pay for a glass, and they will both laugh violently.\"\nThe above is taken from pencil notes written while Elvira was communi\ncating.\nMay 29th, 6.25 p.m.\nl I questioned these two gentlemen, but they conld not remember.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 460\nThe following evening (May 30th), Elvira manifested in somnambulism\nand told me she had been informed that M. would take a glass of Marsala,\nbut that she was not certain, as M. might change her mind at the last\nmoment.\nOn the morning of the 31st, I arranged to witness the realization,\nunknown to Signa Maria and her friend, for fear of interfering with the\ncourse of events. Since April 11th, when Signa M. wrote down and repeated to\nme the second part of the dream, I had never mentioned the subject ; later\non, it had evidently vanished from her supraliminal consciousness, and she was\n; unaware of Elvira's successive communications, as they had taken place in\nsomnambulism.\nTo avoid recognition I wore a coat of a colour unlike any I habitually\nwear, and a hat of a very common shape, which I had not used for several\nyears. About 9.30 a.m. I went towards the Caffe Nazionale. But as the\nname of the caffe' had never been stated, and as we had only guessed it\nfrom topographical indications, it suddenly occurred to me that there might\nbe some mistake about the place, and that tho scene of action might\npossibly be the Caffe dell' Arena, which was close by. I walked up and\ndown in front of the Caffi5 Nazionale for some time, hoping to meet some\nfriend who would watch the CafK dell' Arena, but in vain. But whon I\nsaw that there were several persons in the latter, I thought that Signa\nMaria would on that account be unwilling to enter it, and I decided to go to\nthe Caffe Nazionale. I seated myself at a table in a rather dark place, far\n\/rom the door.\nThe two tables which stood on each side of the door, near to the windows,\nwere occupied ; one of them by several persons who were talking animatedly.\nThis was an unfavourable circumstance, as it might prevent Signa Maria\nfrom entering, or, if she entered, she would be obliged to sit far from the\nwindows, and so would not see her friend passing. I therefore concluded\nthat if the dream were to be realized, these persons would soon go. As a\nfact the tables were both empty a few minutes before ten, and only two or\nthree people remained, farther back in the room.\nHere is the account of what now occurred. It is based upon notes taken\nat the time, and on a more detailed account written a few hours later.\nAt 10 precisely Sign* M. passed in front of the CafK walking rather fast.\nShe was going towards the Caffe dell' Arena, near the bridge of San Lorenzo.\nShe passed the door of the Caffe Nazionale, but just as I was losing sight\n\\ of her, she turned suddenly, as if she had come to a resolution, and,\nentering the Caffe' seated herself at one of the empty tables near the\nwindow. I raised a newspaper which I had kept unfolded for the purpose,\nand hid myself behind it, pretending to read, though I was really watching\nher movements over the top of it.\nShe ordered a glass of Cyprus ; a cake was also brought to her, but I did\nnot see if she ate it, not being able to watch her continuously. She sometimes\nglanced in my direction and obliged me to hide my forehead and eyes behind\nthe journal. Soon after she began to feel behind her, and showed signs of\nconfusion, blushing very much. She often looked out of the window\nimpatiently, and then turned to look at the room, but she did not appear to\nrecognise me ; I took care to let my hat be seen. It was, as I said, of a\n\f470 F. W. H. Myers.\nvery common shape, but quite unlike those I usually wore. She felt her\nearrings repeatedly, but I could not see whether she removed them. The\nwaiter brought her some illustrated papers which she opened and looked at\ncarelessly, glancing now into the street and again into the room.\nIf the dream were to be exactly fulfilled, the friend must pass while\nSigna M. was looking out. At 10.17 Sign\" Linda Bigoni passed (who was the\nfriend dreamed of).\nShe walked fast in the direction of the bridge of San Lorenzo, towards\nthe CafK dell' Arena. At that moment Signa M. saw and called her ; but\nshe refused to come in and went on. Signa M. then rose quickly, went to\nthe door and called her more loudly. Signa Linda, whom I had lost sight of\nfor a moment, came back. They exchanged some words near the door, but I\nonly heard distinctly these words of Signa Linda's, \"and if I had not\npassed 1 \" They re-entered the Caff& directly. Signa Maria offered a glass\nto her friend and they then talked and laughed together, but quietly (not\nnoisily as Elvira had said).\nAt 10.25 Signa M. went out, apparently because she saw some one to whom\nshe wished to speak. At 10.26 she came in again.\nSoon after, seeing that Signa Linda had emptied her glass, and fearing\nthey might leave before I had time to question them, I gave up waiting to\nsee if they would laugh loudly as Elvira had predicted, and went to sit close\nto them.\nThey seemed greatly surprised to see me, and gave me a short account of\nwhat I knew already. Signa Maria said she should never have supposed\nthat the person reading the newspaper was I, and that she had felt impatient '\nfor me and the other two or three people present to go, so that she might\nbe less ashamed to tell the waiter that she had no money and to leave some\narticle as a pledge.\nShe said she had thought of leaving an earring, only that it would look odd\nto go away with one ; not remembering in her confusion that she could put\nthe other in her pocket. She tried to take off a ring, but it was too tight.\nShe seemed very much annoyed at not having recognised me, as she\nmight have appealed to me, and thus have spared herself some emotion and\na consequent headache.\nShe told me she had gone out that morning to visit two customers, one\nof whom lived in this neighbourhood (Via Noci), but that in any case she\nwould have come this way to-day on account of other business. She had\nnot found her clients at home, and could have returned a shorter way with\nout passing the CafK Nazionale, but she wanted to see the oleographs in the\nwindow of the lithographer, Prospering so she turned, and first passed the\nCafK dell' Arena and then the Caffe Nazionale. She was tired and warm, and\nwhen passing the Caffe dell' Arena had thought of going in, but there were\ntoo many people. When she was passing the CafK Nazionale, the idea\nsuddenly occurred to her again and she entered. When I questioned\nSigna Linda, she told me she was not in the habit of passing through this\nstreet. She had by chance passed there also the day before, about ten, but\nthat was the first time for a long period. Her reason for coming to-day was\nthat she had a dress to make for a lady who lived in this direction, but\nfarther on. She had chosen the morning for her visit by pure chance, having\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 471\nat first decided to go in the evening. But this morning about nine she dis\ncovered that the trimming of the dress was wanting. She thought she\nwould go out to buy it, and then resolved to visit her customer about it first.\nShe even showed me the pattern of the trimming she was carrying to her\nclient\nShe told me she hardly ever carried money and that it was by pure\nchance again that she happened to have a lire with her, and so was able to\nrender the little service to Signa Maria. Yesterday when she passed she had\nnot even a centime.\n; Signa Maria added that she had had some hope of seeing her doctor or her\nfriend P. pass, because they lived in the neighbourhood, but that she had\nnever thought of Linda. When the waiter had brought her the papers she\nwas much disturbed, and a sudden and permanent headache came on. She\nsaid she had never gone into a shop without money before, and that she\nwould never enter that Caffe' again.\nAs there was nothing more to be learned from the conversation of the\ntwo, and as no harm could now be done by telling them, I now informed\nthem that I had known all about the incident before. Signa Maria, who was\nused to such things, and was still feeling annoyance, was very little surprised ;\nbut it was very different with Signa Linda, who could not understand how I\nknew she would pass this place at this time. I pointed out to them, how\never, that the realisation was perhaps not quite complete ; for Signa Maria\nought to have eaten the cake, and I had not observed whether she had done\nso. But both of them assured me that she had.\n[I have not related this conversation in detail for the sake of making my\nstory more amusing, but for the sake of stating all the facts known to me,\nwhich may be useful when the case comes to be discussed, and may throw\nsome light upon the states of consciousness of the two persons, immediately\nafter the event.] The same day, at about 3.30 p.m. , I went to see Signa Maria,\nwhom I found in bed with the headache which had come on at the Caff\u00e9. I\nstopped it by suggestion and hypnotisation. The Elvira personality profited\nby this hypnosis to manifest and ask if all had happened as she had pre\ndicted. She has a childish character, and often causes misunderstandings\nbetween us and the other mediumistic personalities ; she showed much satis\nfaction, and said \"Now you see how exactly I am able to tell you things.\"\nSigna Maria was still slightly surprised at the occurrence, but said I must be\nmistaken in supposing that the event had been pre-announced in some dream\ni of hers ; because she said she did not remember anything about it, though\nshe remembered the other dreams quite well.\nAlthough this amnesia can be easily explained by the fact that the dream\nhad happened two months before, it draws our attention to the probable\nexistence of a particular psychological problem, related to the recollection of\npremonitory communications. In fact, in the experiments with telepathic\ndreams, in which Signa Maria acted as agent, we discover a striking tendency\nto amnesia (for the supraliminal consciousness of Signa Maria) of the tele-\npathically transferred images. Therefore it may not be out of place to try\nto discover if anomalies of memory may not also be present in cases of pre\nmonition, although these phenomena differ, in so far that in them the subject\napparently acts as percipient instead of agent ; in reality they may be per\n\f472 F. W. H. Myers.\nfectly analogous in cases like the present, where the premonition (taking the\nword in its strictest sense) may be only apparent. and the realisation may be\ndue to telepathic action on the part of the subject. Thus an accurate study\nof anomalies of memory may perhaps some day furnish us with data for dis\ntinguishing premonitions realised by the subject's supernormal activity from\nthose (if such there be) which are realised independently of the subject.\nI remark in passing that in the case of the arrival of an unknown travel\nler, when it was more likely that Signa Maria was percipient, instead of tele\npathic agent, she perfectly remembered the premonition directly upon its\nrealisation. In the other cases, where the premonition occurred in somnaui -\nbulism, followed, as a rule, by amnesia, all necessary data are wanting.\nTaking into consideration the separate particulars of the premonition\nafter its completion by the last information given by Elvira ; dividing them\ninto two groups as they were or were not realisable or capable of being known\nbeforehand by the normal personality of Signa Maria ; and at the same time\nseparating such as were realised from such as were not, we can epitomise\nthem in the following table. The particulars which were partly realised, or\npartly non-realised, are enclosed between parenthesis.\nParticulars which Sign\"\nMaria might have real\nised, or have been\nalready acquainted with\nin a normal manner.\nRealised.\n\/The forgetting of the\ni purse.\nImpression of heat.\nGoing into the Cafre.\nOrdering glass, etc.\nI Confusion; idea of leav\ning earring, hope that\nan acquaintance might\nNot realised.\n(Order of glass of\nMarsala.)\n(Extreme merriment).\nV\nParticulars which Signa\nM. could neither have\nforeknown nor realised\nin a normal way.\n(Merriment).\nAspect of waiter.\nPassing of friend, and\ncoincidence that at that\nmoment M. was look\ning out of window.\nAccidental circum-\nstance that friend had\nmoney.\nPresence in Caff\u00e9 of\nother persons not seen\nin dream.\nIt is clear that those particulars which were realised, and which are\nplaced in the upper group, do not add to the evidence for the premonition ;\nit is proved only by those in the second group. However the table shows\nthat the particulars of the upper, invalid group had no more tendency to\ncomplete realization than those in the lower.\nIndeed, if the content of the premonition had been more closely connected\nwith Signa Maria's normal activity than with that of extraneous persons, she\nought to have preferred Marsala to Cyprus, and she would have laughed with\nher friend much more openly than she really did. But when later I asked\nSigna Maria if she had hesitated between Cyprus and something else, she\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 473\nsaid no, because she generally took Cyprus ; she added (what I knew before)\nthat she did not much like Marsala.\nAs I before remarked, even the present case does not help to demonstrate\nthe precognition of things altogether independent of the subject ; the latter's\nsubliminal activity would explain all. It may have set in action not only\nthe subject herself, but by means of telepathy, her friend also. The follow\ning circumstances would seem to support this hypothesis.\n1. The first act of the realisation, the forgetting of the purse, occurred in\na state of abstraction, and a state of abstraction is one of the natural fields in\nthich the subliminal activity displays itself.\n2. It was Signa Maria's desire to see the oleographs in Prosperini's\nwindow which led her to take the way past the CafK Nazionale, and, as she\ntold me, this wish came into her mind suddenly. She also declared that she\nhad never felt the wish before, although she was often in the neighbourhood\nand frequently passed Prosperini's shop. This is analogous to a subliminal\n3. The heat which Signa Maria felt, and which induced the wish to enter\nthe Caff\u00e9 dell' Arena (she told me afterwards that she was covered with per\nspiration), although explicable by her rapid walk, was perhaps exaggerated\nwhen it is remembered that the day in question was not very warm. 1 This\npermits us to suspect that her impression of heat and perspiration may have\nresulted in part from a self-suggestion.\n4. The act of entering the Caff\u00e9 Nazionale after having renounced the\nidea of entering the Caff\u00e9 dell' Arena was performed without premeditation,\nbecause in the first place Signa Maria explained that after she had passed\nthe Caffe1 dell' Arena she did not remember that there was another Caff\u00e9 a\nlittle farther on ; she had forgotten its existence ; and also because, as I\nmyself remarked, she seemed, when entering the place, to be yielding to a\nsudden impulse, which recalls so-called automatic actions determined by\nsubliminal stimuli\n5. Signa Linda was not induced to leave her house and walk past the Caffe1\nby any reason clearly independent of presumable telepathic action, but\nrather by an impulse which sprang up with the apparent spontaneity which\noften accompanies telepathic impulses.\nBut on the other hand we have two circumstances which appear to con\ntradict the hypothesis that the realisation was determined telepathically by\n1. Although the passing of Signa Linda may be attributed to telepathic\naction, it is very difficult not to see a determining cause in the circum\nstances which preceded her action (i.e., the commission to make a dress\nfor a lady in the neighbourhood), or, at the least, an almost necessary\nauxiliary, to the telepathic action ; and it is still more difficult to suppose\nthat these very circumstances should have been the outcome of a sub\nconsciously elaborated plan carried out by telepathic action on the part of\nSigna Maria.\nimpulse.\n' On the 31st May, 1894, the Astronomical Observatory of Padua registered a tem\nperature of 18 6deg. (Celsius) at 9 a,m. ; and 21*0deg. at 3 p,m.\n\f474 F. W. H. Myers.\n2. As I remarked before, the particulars of the premonition directly\nrealisable by Signa Maria did not show any tendency to be fulfilled with\ngreater precision than those which depended on the action of a person un\nconcerned in the matter.\nObserve that May 30th and 31st, the two days between which\nElvira hesitated, were both of them days on which Signa Linda actually\npassed the cafe1 in question.\nP. 212.\nPremonitory dream of the visit of a commercial traveller who asked for a\nsubscription to a novel. Percipient, Maria Manzini.\nSignorina Maria Manzini at my request, kept an account of the dreams\nwhich occurred in her ordinary sleep. Some were remembered spon\ntaneously in the morning and some in her next somnambulic state. In the\nlatter case I suggested to her that she should remember and record them\nafter waking.\nI think the following case was remembered in somnambulism, but this is\nof no consequence, because Signa Maria, following my advice, recorded not\nonly the date of dreams, but also the date and the hour when she wrote\nthem down. In any case the present dream was recorded before its fulfil\nment.\nThis is what I find in the record of Signa Maria's dreams :\u2014\n\"Night of March 26th-27th, 1894.\"\n\"I dreamt that the door bell rang on the S. Pietro side of the house.1 I\nwent to open and found a tall man about forty years old, with greyish\ntrousers and a darker overcoat. He was very polite, and asked if I would\nsubscribe to the issue of a novel, saying that afterwards I should have a\npair of earrings as a prize. I said no, because I thought it was an impos\nture.\"\nMarch 27th, 1894, 11 p.m.\nI did not read the account of this dream till after its realization, but am\nperfectly certain that Signa Maria told it to me directly, and I also dis\ntinctly recollect that when Signa Maria related the realization a few days\nlater, she said I ought to remember her preceding dream ; and I remember\nalso that I not only recalled it, but that I looked at once at the record to see\nif it had been written down according to rule. I found that it was correct\nand that it agreed with the viva voce story. Besides though Signa Maria may\nnot always be diligent in recording dreams she hardly remembers, she is\nvery careful to put the exact date, and is therefore quite certain that the\ndream occurred either in the night of March 26th-27th, or at most (suppos\ning the case to have been complicated by a paramnesia which displaced\nthe dream in time) on March 27th, at 9 p.m. ; about which time, as can be\nseen from my journal of the somnambulic experiments, Signa Maria was in\nsomnambulism in my presence.\n1 Signa Maria's house has two doors, one in the Via S. Pietro, and the other-\nturned towards the river Bacchiglione.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 475\nOn the evening of March 31st, i.e. four days after the dream, Signa M.\ntold me that on that day about 3 p.m. the visit of which she had dreamed had\ntaken place. Everything coincided ; the entrance of the person by the door\ntowards S. Pietro, his age, his insinuating manners, the colour of his\ntrousers and overcoat, and the object of his visit.\nI called her mother, and asked her to describe the visit with all possible\ndetails ; meanwhile I took the following notes : \"The person came twice ;\nthe first time about 11 a.m., when Maria was out. Signora Annetta (her\nmother) was alone in the house. The visitor had very pleasant manners,\n\u2022 and was about thirty-five years old (Sign\" Maria thought forty). He had\na box covered with black cloth with him, such as is used by commercial\ntravellers. He said he came to show them a novelty. In order to get rid\nof him, Signora Annetta said that Signorina Maria was not at home ; he\nreplied that he would return, and Signora Annetta told him to come at 2 p.m.\nAt 2 p.m. he returned and rang at the door on the S. Pietro side. Signora\nAnnetta opened to him, and says that when he entered the room Maria\nseemed much astonished (Maria said at once that she was astonished at\nrecognising him). He proposed that they should subscribe to the issue of\na novel ; there were to be prizes when the issue was finished ; two pictures,\nor a small organ, or a pair of earrings. In his box were the organ and an\nalarum, as samples, and he had with him, but not in the box, samples of\nthe earrings, of the frames, and two oleographs between pasteboards.\nLuigia Monti and Linda Bigoni were also present. Maria refused the\noffers. When they and the man were gone, Maria remarked with surprise\nthat she had already dreamt of the scene with all its details, i.e., as far as\nthe man was concerned. Signora Annetta added that from girlhood she\nalso had frequently dreamed of coming events.\nMarch 31st 1894, 9.30 p.m. (written in the presence of Annetta and\nMaria). It was necessary to prove two things, before the case could be\nsupposed to be evidential. First, that the visit was real, and not an odd\nhallucination of the senses or memory, and secondly, that the man had not\nmade the tour of Padua, offering his merchandise, many days before the\ndream ; in which case Signa Maria might have become aware of it in some\nway or other, and thus have originated the dream herself.\nIn order to clear up the first point, I went on the following day (April 1st,\nabout 6.30) to see Signa Linda Bigoni and asked her to tell me all about the\nvisit at which she had been present. She replied that she had gone to see\n' Maria the day before, about 2.30, while the man was there, and she con\nfirmed all the details about the object of his visit, his remarks, the things\nhe had with him, his politeness, his age, and the colour of his clothes.\nHe had made the same proposition to her as to Maria. As she had arrived\nafter him, she could not say by which door he had entered ; but she said\nhe had left before her, and had gone out by the kitchen door, towards\nthe river. On being questioned, she replied that she had not seen Sigoa\nMaria since the visit. Before leaving her, I requested her, if the man\nshould come to her house, or if she should meet him in the street, to ask\nhim on what day he had come to Padua ; which she promised to do.\nThe same evening I went back to Signa Maria and before telling her of\nmy talk with Signorina Linda, I questioned her and her mother again.\n\f476 F. W. H. Myers.\nSignorina Maria said she did not remember by which door the man had\ngone out, or rather, she had paid no attention, but her mother said she was\ncertain that he had gone out by the kitchen door, because he had seen some\none enter that way, and on leaving had said that as there was a door there\nalso he would go out by it. The mother did not know however whether he\nor Signorina Linda- B. had left first, but Signorina Maria was sure he had\ngone- away first, because afterwards she had continued her conversation with\nSignorina Linda about their own affairs, and this conversation, begun before\nhe left, had prevented her noticing by which door he quitted the house.\nBoth then said they remembered Signorina Linda B.'s coming at about\n2.30 while the man was there, and that he had come before 2 and stayed\nnearly an hour.\nThus all the testimony is in accordance, and no doubt remains that the\nevent with all its details really happened.\nOn the evening of April 18th, Signa Maria told me that her friend,\nSigna Linda B., had something to tell me, but in order to keep her promise\nshe would tell it only to me. Signorina Miiria said that Linda B. was coming\nto see her on the morrow, when I could meet her.\nThe following day (April 19th) I went to see Signa Maria at the time\nfixed, and found Linda B. at the house. The latter told me she had met the\nman in the street ; that he had recognised her and had renewed his offer.\nShe took advantage of this to ask him when he had arrived in Padua, and\nhe said he had come on March 29th, and that he had not visited Padua\nbefore for several years.\nThis proves that the dream occurred two days before the arrival of the\nperson implicated, and that consequently it could not have resulted from a\nmere sensorial impression of Signorina Maria's.\nOf such a type as this ;\u2014 gradually evolved, slightly inexact, and\naltogether trivial,\u2014are all the predictions given through Elvira. I\ndo not think, however, that their triviality affords in itself any clear\nindication as to their origin. They are the attempts of an intelligence\nwhich, whether embodied or unembodied, is not much above a child's\nlevel, to prove a fact of the highest importance,\u2014namely, the possibility\nof foreseeing future events. In comparison with the value of the result\nthus aimed at, the actual incidents by which it may be attained matter\nlittle. It is of greater interest to have a pedlar's visit foretold, if only\nthat visit could not have been foreseen by any ordinary intelligence,\nthan to have, say, a death foretold, if we suspect that that more impres\nsive prophecy may have helped to work its own fulfilment.\nSince Dr. Ermacora's cases were in our hands he has published in\nthe Bivista di Studi Psichici for July, 1895, a curiously parallel series\nof trifling telepathic incidents, mixed with premonition, obtained\nthrough automatic writing by Signor M. Bonatti, a painter known to\nhim. This case, of which I here print a partial translation, tends, as\nfar as it goes, to show that the secondary personality in those other\ncases is probably identical with Maria Manzini herself.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 477\nP. 245.\nTelepathic Perceptions by means of Automatic Writing.\nBy M. Bonatti.\nTranslated from the Rivista di Studi Psichici, July, 1895.\nI began to write automatically with the hand of a medium resting on mine,\nbut soon I was able to write alone. The communications were at first of a\nspiritualistic character, and the writing was a fair imitation of that of the\ndefunct who appeared to be present, and whom I had known in life.\nI However, I was acquainted with their writing. I was generally advised to\nwork and study much ; my counsellor was interested in my moral life, and\nwas a more attentive friend than any I have found in flesh and blood. Soon\nafter I was obsessed by a lying and frivolous, but not wicked, personality,\nwho displayed a great passion for art. This personality was only useful to me\non that point, giving me advice, and, by means of automatic drawing, greatly\ndeveloping my memory of drawing and powers of conception. I did not\nwrite for several months, in order to free myself of this obsession. Mean\nwhile I enlarged my knowledge of psychical matters ; and when I began to\nwrite again I succeeded in convincing the communicating personality that it\nmight be an emanation from my own subconscious self. After this it called\nitself my Secondo.\nI examined this Secondo to see if it possessed any supernormal powers,\nand discovered some. It continued to give me useful advioe, and strengthened\nmy love of art.\nWhen I write automatically I do not know what the communication will\nbe ; sometimes I guess after a few words, but I often guess wrongly, and\nwrite something altogether unlike my guess.\nI enjoy perfectly good health, and am able to endure constant outdoor\nexercise without fatigue. As far as I know, I am psychically normal. I retain\nall my normal faculties when writing automatically.\n[Signor Bonatti begins by giving an account of telepathic communications\ntransmitted to him by sleeping and dreaming persons at a greater or less\ndistance, and revealed in automatic writing. We then come to monitions of\nactual or impending events.]\nThe following is copied from my journal.\nOctober XUh, 1892, 7.30 p.m.\n, I write \"Go to Pedrocchi's, because M. O. is there.\"\nI wanted to see my friend M. O., whom I find in the evening at the Caffe'\nPedrocchi, except on certain fixed evenings when he cannot come. This was\none of these evenings. I went and found my friend, who had been\nunexpectedly liberated from his engagement.\nOctober 21st, 7.30 p.m.\nI write, \" M. 0. is now mentioning your name to Sig^ R.\" Two hours\nafter I meet M. O., who says he spoke of me to Sig^ R. about 7.30, apropos\nof a letter which he had received that evening, and which contained a\nreference to me. I had not seen him all the day, knew nothing of the letter,\nnor that he was with Sig\"a R. when I was writing.\n2 m\n\f478 F. W. H. Myers.\nNovember 2nd, 4 p.m.\nI write, \"Ermacora has arrived by the tramway.\" I knew that Dr.\nErmacora had left Padua this morning and that he would return during the\nday, but I did not know where he was going, nor when the trains came in.\nThis evening Dr. Ermacora told me that he came from the station by\ntramway, and that he got off it about 4 p.m. in the Piazza Garibaldi. I had\nnot left my study for many hours, and no one who could have seen Dr.\nErmacora arrive had been to see me. I cannot hear the tramway nor see\nthe Piazza Garibaldi from my study, and there are no windows on the street,\nthrough which I could have heard anything.\nFebruary 20th, 1893.\nI write, \" X. has received the money from C. I.\"\nI wrote this communication, which much interested me, two days after X.\nhad received the money. I had had no information, and no conversation with\nX. , with whom I had disagreed, and who had reasons for keeping silence, as\nhe wished to retain the part of the money which should have come to me. I\nhad been long awaiting the payment of this debt, but I could not even\napproximately guess that C. I. would pay it just then.\nFebruaiy 26th, 1 p.m.\nI write, \"I am poisoning myself. Think of me.\" The writing begins\nwith a name I cannot decipher, but which I guess.\nMarch 19th.\u2014To-day a friend of the person whose name I guessed told me\nspontaneously that that person had attempted to poison herself several days\nago. On the 26th, when I had the communication, she was at Bologna, and\nmade the attempt later at Rovigo. I do not know if it was the first attempt,\nnor, if it was so, whether she had decided to do it when I wrote. I had no\nreason to suppose that A. G. would wish to take her own life. Unfortunately\nI have had no more communications from her which might have given me\nmore details.\nMarch 13Wi.\u2014I write, \"Shall come to you before Saturday to pay you.\nM. and S.\"\n[March 22nd, I learned to-day that M. and S. could have paid me before\nthe term fixed by the communication, as they had received the money, part\nof which was owing to me, before that date. I had had no reason to suppose\nthey could have been in a position to pay me before ;\u2014could not even have\nguessed it.]\nMarch 17th. \u2014I write, \" Run to the Club. Go.\" I have not been to the\nClub for more than a month, and intended to go to bed at once. My friend,\nA. L., who rarely goes to the Club, had this evening assisted at a conference\non Guido Bonatti. Association of ideas made him think of me, and he went\nto the Club believing he would find me there. I obeyed the telepathic order,\nand thus discovered what had caused it.\nMarch 20th.\u2014The automatic writing confirmed the communication of the\n13th inst. [As I have written above, I only discovered the truth on the 22nd\ninst.]\nMarch 25th.\u2014The automatic writing tells me about the money of which I\nwrote on the 13th and 20th insts. I understand that I shall be paid on\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 479\nTuesday. I wrote to R., one of the persons concerned, on the 27th, hoping\nto be paid through his intervention. He replied the same day, \" I am still\nunwell, and to-morrow [Tuesday] I must go out of town.\" [So that he could\nnot pay before Wednesday.]\nInstead of this, he did not go out of town on Tuesday, but came on that\nday to pay me, as the communication had foretold.\nMurch 28th, 10 a.m. \u2014I write, \" You will receive a visit shortly.\" Twenty\nminutes later I had a visitor. At that time of day I receive nobody uninvited,\nand this visit was quite unexpected.\nMarch 28th, Tuesday. \u2014To-day I wrote that a person would come on\nSaturday, bringing money from X.\nApril 1st. Saturday. \u2014This evening the automatic writing told me that R.\nhad been looking for me at 4.30, to give me \" Carte valori, 40 Lire.\"\nSeveral days later I learned that R. was really looking for me on Saturday\nat 4.30, to give me money. He had only 20 lire with him, but had hoped at\nfirst to give me 40. I think I had no reason to believe that R. would pay me\n40 lire, neither more nor less.\nApril 7th, 5.45 p.m.\u2014I wrote, \"Girls will come to the studio to-day.\nThey will visit you.\"\n6.15 p.m.\u2014A girl has just come, as I was going out. She had decided\njust before to come and ask me for some information. Contrary to my habit\nI had remained longer in my studio. Generally nobody comes after five, as I\nleave at that hour.\nMay 8th. Morning. \u2014A communication partly illegible. \"You will\nreceive . . . Ang\u2014\u2014 Go to-day, which will tell you about M.,\nbecause she has been talking to him.\"\nAng Go\u2014\u2014 is at Venice. Many days ago I had charged her to say\ncertain things to M. if she met him. He lives at Venice. On this evening\n(the 8th) I received a card from Ang Go , relating her conversation with\nM. whom she had met by chance. After the \"You will receive to-day\" in\nthe automatic writing, there are several attempts at a word. Now I know all\nabout it, I can see that the word is meant for \"postcard.\"\nMay 16th. \u2014Several unimportant things. \" We shall meet to-morrow. I\nshall come to you at (not clear whether 9.30 or 11) and will stop till one.\"\nCommunication begins with the name of G N .\nMay 17th.\u2014Before I wrote yesterday, G N had told me she could\nnot come to me to-day. However, she came at 11, and at once told me she\ncould only stay till one. She generally stops till 2.30 or 3.\nFebruary 5th, 1894. Venice\u2014(I lived at Padua while receiving the\nprevious communications). The automatic writing informs me that my\nmother at Padua has had something the matter with her hand. [About\ntwenty days later I verified this. No one had told me of it. ]\nFebruary 6th. Venice.\u2014\"You will have a letter to-morrow.\" Having\njust written the above information about my mother, I understand that the\nletter will be from her.\nOn the 18th inst. I again wrote that my mother was suffering from her\nhand. I had not yet verified the communication of the 5th. After writing,\n2 m 2\n\f480 F. W. H. Myers.\nmy hand automatically turned over the leaves of my writing book till the\nabove communication about the letter came under my eyes. I had paid no\nattention to it at the time, and now looked over my mother's letters. I found\none with the postal stamp, \"Padua, 5th February, 1894, 5 p.m. \u2014Venice,\n5th February, 1894, 7 p.m.\" I certainly received it on the morning of the\n6th, as I never get letters in the evening.\nUnfortunately I have not kept all the original writings before January,\n1893, I have preserved only those which were verified. This is due to my\nthen inexperience, for I thought it useless to preserve unverifiable com\nmunications. I remember that till January, 1893, false communications were\nrare, and the unverifiable ones were numerous.\nFrom the beginning of 1893 till February 5th, 1894, against twenty-seven\ncommunications verified, I have recorded eight false ones, eighteen which I\ncould not verify, five which were wholly or partly correct, but where I am\nnot certain that the information may not have reached me in some normal but\nunnoticed manner, and two which were correct but not exact.\nI reckon that from October, 1892, till January, 1893, there may have been\nfive false announcements. Thus there may have been altogether thirteen\nfalse communications.\nI conclude from my personal experiences that the principal cause of\nfailure is the intervention of the normal consciousness, which occurs most\neasily when the writing is slow and illegible, or when the communication is\ndesired. I do not remember ever having received a truthful message when I\nwished for it. The true telepathic cases were always spontaneous, and\nimproved by the exercise of the faculty. A true message was nearly always\nfollowed by other true ones ; then came a false one, which caused discourage\nment, and initiated an annoying series of falsehoods, till another success\nrestored confidence.\nI have observed that confidence is the best condition for obtaining\npsychical phenomena. ,\nSignor Bonatti is a friend of Dr. Ermacora, who has been sometimes\npresent when he was writing automatically ; on one or two occasions when\nthe writing was of telepathic origin. Signor Bonatti cannot obtain much\nconfirmation, partly on account of the lapse of time, and partly because the\nsupposed agents are persons whom he has lost sight of. In the case of\nNovember 2nd, Dr. Ermacora well remembers that on the same eveningI\nSignor Bonatti asked him if he had really arrived at the hour mentioned,\nand that he had done so. Signor Bonatti did not at first recognise the\nimportance of controlling his experiences, and was perhaps afraid of exciting\nthe derision of the persons concerned. He has however kept and sent the two\nletters concerning the cases of March 25th and May 8th, 1893, which are\npartly translated below. The second, though dated May 7th, was really-\nposted at Venice on the 8th, as the post-mark proves. First letter :\u2014\nDear Angblo,\u2014X. wrote me yesterday that you have received my part\nfor the work for the Salon. I hope you are better. I only heard yesterday\nthat you were ill. Pardon my troubling you.\u2014Yours affectionately,\nM. [Bonatti.]\n1 This phrase is thus corrected by Dr. Ermacora, after reference to his notes, from\nthe Italian account.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 481\nMarch Wth (?), 1893.\nSecond letter. Reply :\u2014\nDear 51. [Bonatti],\u2014I am still unwell, but must go out of town to\nmorrow. Manzoni came just now, and gave me 90 lire for you ; that is the\nlast which the Ignoranti destined for me. I cannot go to M.'s before\nWednesday, and will come to your study on Wednesday afternoon and hand\nyou the 90 lire. Angeao.\n(This reply was written in pencil on the back of the first letter).\nThird letter :\u2014\nVenice, May 7th, 1893.\nI found M. and told him what you charged me to say. He told me he had\nwritten to you before leaving, and that he would write again and send you his\nportrait-Yours, Angelina.\n(Post-mark Venice, May 8th).\nIn the cases thus far quoted there has been some ground for\nsupposing that the prediction came either from the percipient's own\nmind, or from some other incarnate mind, or from a mind which, even\nif unembodied, is scarcely distinguishable from the percipient's own. I\nproceed to a few cases where the warning seems attributable to some\nrecognised discarnate spirit.\nAnd here I would begin by referring the reader to the cases\npublished in Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 170, under the title of\n\" Indications of Continued Terrene Knowledge on the part of\nPhantasms of the Dead.\"\nIf the departed do indeed in some, perhaps relatively rare, cases\npreserve a certain power of following the earthly career of those dear to\nthem (and we have little evidence of a knowledge on their part wider\nthan this), then it is probable that they will foresee both some events\nwhich we on earth can foresee, and some which we cannot. In the\npaper just referred to, cases G 213, 214, 215, 216, 219, and 221 (a\ncollective case) suggest a departed friend foretelling an approaching\ndeath,\u2014usually a death already recognised as imminent by observers on\nearth.\nIn another case (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 349), where warnings\nwere given as to the dangers run by a secret conspirator, no precognition,\nproperly speaking, was needed, but only a knowledge of the young\nman's actual rashness. So, again, in the following narrative, a\nknowledge, on the part of a deceased person, of the concealed inten\ntions of the Bank Managers would be enough to prompt the warning.\nP. 331.\n[This case is virtually made first hand by Dr. Hastings' letter.]\nThe following story was told me by Miss Graham herself, also told by\nher to Professor Barrett, who met her at our house. She was an American\n\f482 F. W. H. Myers.\nM.D., a woman between 30 and 40 years of age, in full vigour of practical\nlife, whose perfect healthfulness of mind and body impressed all who met\nher. No one could have been less of a visionary. Descended from a line of\nmedical ancestors, she was a marked instance of hereditary tendency. A*\nsoon as she learned to write her name she added M.D. to it, and in her\nchildish play was always either doctor or nurse to her playmates. Her\nfather was unable to give her a medical education, and possibly unwilling\nalso, but she took this matter into her own hands. Beginning as a teacher\nin a school, she went on as nurse in an insane asylum, and then to make\nmoney faster, learnt book-keeping, and went as clerk in a merchant's office,\nwhere she worked steadily for eight years, until she had saved enough\nfor her college career, through which she passed with extraordinary\nsuccess.\nShe had put these precious savings into a bank in Boston started on\nphilanthropic principles, to give good interest to women. There was no\nsuspicion about the bank, guaranteed as it was by well-known names. But\none morning Miss Graham woke hearing a voice say, \"Miss Graham, take\nyour money out of the Bank.\" Going to sleep again, she woke in the morn\ning inclined to treat it as a dream. She quite believed in these voices, from\nfrequent experience, but came within a recent legal definition of sanity, by not\nobeying th ir suggestions unless otherwise commending themselves to her\njudgment. Accordingly, instead of going to the bank, she fulfilled an engage\nment in another part of the town with her dressmaker. Here she was obliged\nto wait, finding herself in the same room with another lady who seemed deter-\nmined to talk to her. Bather impatient at being delayed, Miss Graham\nwas not socially inclined, till the stranger suddenly asked, \"Do you\nknow anything of Howe's Bank ? \" When she replied with interest,\n\" Only that I have an account there.\" Her interest deepened as the lady\nproceeded to give details about the unsafe situation of the bank, with which\nher husband was connected, winding up with saying, \" I felt compelled,\nalmost against my will, to tell you all this, and must beg you to say nothing\nabout it for a few weeks.\"\nMiss Graham decided that she would lose no time in making herself safe,\nand only just succeeded in going home for her bank-book, and drawing out\nher deposit, before the hour for closing. The bank stopped on the foUmcing\nday.\nThe labours of 10 years would have gone for nothing without this timely\nwarning.\nTwice during her worn at a London hospital, Miss Graham heard the\nvoice. One night she had gone to her lodgings utterly wearied out, and just\nas she laid her head on the pillow, sho heard the voice \" Mary Graham,\nsuch and such a case (describing it accurately) has just entered the hospital.\"\nMiss Graham had gone straight from the hospital to her lodgings.and had left\nno such a case, one so rare that she had never met with it in any previous\nexperience. She was, moreover, so worn out that she went to sleep. In an\nhour or so afterwards, she was awakened by the voice repeating the informa\ntion. Being somewhat rested, she rose, and on arriving at the hospital\nfound the case at the most critical stage. It had come in shortly after she\nleft the hospital.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 483\nOn another occasion she was unable to obey the voice, and on reaching\nthe hospital, found she had just missed another case of extreme interest.\nThese cases seem worth recording, and I give them as they were related\nto us by Miss Graham herself.\nSeptember 3rd, 1883. Annie E- Rnlt*y.\nBoston, December 13th, 1883.\nRegarding the Howe Bank. First let me say that Mrs. Julia Ward\nHowe was never in any way connected with that Institution. The Mrs.\nHowe who was, is now in jail, and I have the sympathy for her to believe that\n' she did not mean to cheat any one, but her brain and mathematics were not\nsufficient to show her that there must be an end of her operations, and that\nsome one must suffer in that end. With others I got into the affair. I was\none of the late comers, so that I had received no interest. All I had put in I\nconsequently lost. I went with Dr. Grafuim when site drew her money, and\nmight have taken mine, but did not. She believed she had had a warniig from\nher mother. Nothing of the kind had ever come to me. It is hard for me\nto believe evil intentions on the part of any one with whom I have dealings,\nso I trusted the managers, and lost.\nThe voice which Dr. Graham heard saying, \"For a little while only,\"\nwas not during her sickness, but just after she had got settled in her room.\nA few weeks before her death.\nC. E. Hastings.\nDr. Caroline E. Hastings is the professor of anatomy (to a mixed class)\nat a medical college in Boston, so much esteemed that she was asked if her\nbust might be placed in the college. She chose instead to have a library for\nthe students' reference, which was done.\nHer confirmation of Dr. Mary Graham's story is complete. It was Dr.\nGraham's sister who told me that Dr. Hastings was with her when she went\nto the bank, and also about the last voice.\nA. E. Ridley.\nIn the narrative next to be quoted, also, a knowledge of the expelled\nlodger's actual intentions would suffice to show the need of warning.\nThis incident is noticeable from the fact that the phantom was seen by\ntwo persons. It is taken from a long psychical record written for\nDr. Hodgson by a lady who has had many similar experiences, all of\n\u201e which she regards as veridical, although most of them cannot now be\nshown to have been more than subjective. This is not the only case\nwhere a psychical history of mainly subjective aspect has received at\nsome points the support of a second witness for experiences resembling\nthose which the same percipient claims to have undergone in solitude.\nP. 215. Mrs. Norah Gridley.\n306, Rookery Building, Chicago,\nAugust 19th, 1890.\nThe following statement corrected by my mother is true in every\nparticular.\nQueena O. V. Gridley.\n\f484 F. W. H. Myers.\n[Revised from notes made by me in April, 1890.\u2014R.H.]\nIn the month of September, 1889, my young daughter and I were\noccupying a room in a house on the west side. I had no intention of leaving\nthe house then\u2014didn't know when I should go.\nNear 12 p.m., midnight, I woke suddenly ; my daughter at the same\nmoment made an exclamation. I gave a shriek almost appalling. My\ndaughter said, \" Mother, what's the matter ? \" and further said, \"Mother,\nsome one is standing at my head.\" I replied, \"Oh no, go to sleep if\nyou can.\"\nBut I did see something,\u2014I saw the figure of a young man clothed in\nwhite and so transparent that I could see the articles of furniture through\nthe garments, and a voice said distinctly, \"Mother, go away from here,\"\nand for some time after, if I found myself dozing, the same voice would say,\n\"Mother, don't go to sleep.\" At that momenta bright light illuminated\nthe rooms. I saw both doors, one in to the hall, and the other to the\nback room, standing wide open. I knew they had been locked the previous\nevening. I arose and lit the gas,\u2014I then found both doors closed and\nlocked.\nI was so frightened, and the pulsation of my heart so distinct, I know it\ncould have been heard some distance away,\u2014I did not sleep. I arose earlier\nthan usual in the morning, related event of the night to my landlady, who\nsneered at it and said, \" Don't be foolish, you're crazy.\"\nBefore I had finished the recital, my daughter awoke, and said, \"Mother,\ndo you know what happened in the night ? \" \"I guess nothing happened, P\nwhat was it?\" (The landlady was still listening). Her reply was, \"You\ndid know, mother, for your heart beat so violently that it sounded like a\nhammer and shook the bed.\"\nThen I said, \" Why didn't you speak to me about that ? \"\nHer reply was, \" I thought that you thought if I knew that you were\nafraid, we'd both go to pieces.\"\nI then said, \" What did you see ? \"\n\"I saw my brother at my head dressed in white. His clothes were\nglistening like satin, though they were transparent, and I could see right\nthrough them.\" (The figure was translucent to me also).\n\" Did he say anything t \"\n\"You must go away from here, mother.\"\nI turned to my landlady and asked her what she had to say after this\ncorroborative statement.\n\" I think you're both idiots ! \"\n(My daughter was 16 years of age.)\nNext day I was out working, reporting for a paper, and going along the\nSouth side I saw a furnished room to rent. I enquired price and said I\nwould come next day to take possession. I told my daughter on returning\nto get ready, pack up, etc.\nMy daughter said I was crazy.\nThe day after we left and took possession of new room.\nAbout ten days later I called to get some things left at my previous\nlodgings. The landlady said, \" You don't know what an awful thing\nhappened the night after you went away,-\u2014a man raised the window and\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 485\nentered your room. A woman occupying the aforesaid room said, 'What do\nyou want here 1 Get out ! ' The man left, saying, 'I don't want anything\nof you.'\"\nThe woman described the man as \" short, thickset, very dark.\"\nDuring my stay in that house, a man answering this description had\nfailed to pay his room-rent. He and the landlady had had much trouble\nand hard talk. She couldn't get him out. The landlady asked my advice.\nI advised her how to take legal proceedings. She did, and the man left,\nsaying as he departed, \" You were never smart enough to get me out of my\n. room ; it was that black devil downstairs ! \"\nThe woman who occupied the room after I left was a domestic. The\nlandlady was Mrs. Brown, Des Moines, Iowa.\nWith this case I will close my series of those precognitions which I\nregard as in various ways explicable without postulating any direct\nknowledge of the future. The group to which we have now to address\nourselves presents our central problem in a direeter form.\nI do not, indeed, assume that we have come here to any real break\nor. discontinuity in the nature of premonitions themselves. If the\npremonitions already recorded have been due to some kind of inference\nfrom a knowledge of existing facts wider than our own, it is possible\nenough that some or all of the premonitions yet to be mentioned have\nalso been due to inference of some supernormal kind. The break which\nI find here is a purely subjective one. It is simply that I can no longer\nsuggest any plausible explanation of my cases which does not involve\nsome perception of the future more direct than any which our ordinary\nminds enjoy. I see no way in which intelligence of a common human\ntype, working upon however full a knowledge of present facts, could\narrive at some at least of the predictions to be now quoted. It does\nnot, at any rate, seem worth while to strain that explanation further.\nIt may still hold good, but I prefer to throw my remaining evidential\ncases into convenient groups, and to leave the reader to explain each\ngroup as he will.\nFirst, then, I will take a series of cases which recall and extend\n, the cases of promnesia given in my last chapter. In ordinary\npromnesia, as before explained, there is no proof that the incident\nwhich seems to have been already experienced has been so in fact ;\nsince it is only by the fresh experience that the supposed memory of\nthe former one is revived, nor does the incident last long enough to\nallow of any test of the reality of the previous knowledge of it. It\nis plain that there might be two stages evidentially beyond this point.\nIn the first place, the promnesic incident may be sufficiently\ncomplex to allow of some test during its progress ; and in the second\nplace, the dream, or whatever it is, in which the future incident is\nforeseen may have been at once remembered, without waiting for\n\f486 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe arrival of the incident to awaken the memory, and may have been\nrelated to other persons beforehand.\nOf this second and more advanced stage we have many examples ;\ncases, namely, where a person undergoing some definite incident\nstates that that incident had previously in some way been presented\nto him, and sometimes that he had mentioned this presentiment to\nothers, or had recorded it in some way before the event.\nNow as regards cases of this type, especially where the pre\ncognition is alleged to have been conveyed in a dream, the following\nwords of Edmund Gurney's (Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 298)\ndeserve careful attention.\n\"The first objection to dreams,\" he says, \"as evidence for transferred\nimpressions of distant conditions or events, is this, that dreams being often\nsomewhat dim and shapeless things, subsequent knowledge of the conditions\nor events may easily have the effect of giving body and definiteness to the\nrecollection of a dream. When the actual facts are learnt, a faint amount\nof resemblance may often suggest a past dream, and set the mind on the\ntrack of trying accurately to recall it. This very act involves a search for\ndetails, for something tangible and distinct ; and the real features and\ndefinite incidents which are now present in the mind, in close association\nwith some general scene or fact which actually figured in the dream, will be\napt to be unconsciously read back into the dream- they make part of the \u2022\noriginal, of which the mind conceives the dream to have been a picture ; and\nthe picture, when evoked in memory, will only too probably include details\ndrawn from the original. After we have once realised the matter in its full\ndistinctness, it becomes almost impossible to recall with due indistinctness\nthe distant and shadowy suggestion of it. Dreams in this way resemble\nobjects seen in the dusk ; which begin by puzzling the eye, but which, whui\nonce we know or think we know what they are, seem quite unmistakable\nand even full of familiar detail. For our purposes, therefore, it is of prime\nimportance that the dreams shall be told in detail to some one on whose\nmemory we can rely ; or, better still, written down, or in some way acted on,\nat the time, and before the confirmation arrives.\" 1\nBearing in mind this caution, (which refers also, by the way, to\nseveral cases already quoted), and omitting almost all cases where\n1 In a paper in Mind, for April, 1888, further developed in a \"Report on\nPhantasms and Presentiments,\" (Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical\nResearch. March, 1889), Professor Royce, of Harvard, presses the caution which\nEdmund Gurney's words inculcate into a further hypothesis (American Proceedings,\np. 366). ' This hypothesis is,\" he says, \" that in certain people, under certain exciting\ncircumstances, there occur what I shall henceforth call Pseudo-Presentiments, i.e. , more\nor less instantaneous and irresistible hallucinations of memory, which make it seem to\none that something which now excites or astonishes him has been pre-figured in a\nrecent dream, or in the form of some other warning, although this seeming is wholly\nunfounded, and although the supposed prophecy really succeeds its own fulfilment.\"\nIn support of this thesis, Professor Royce quotes two records of insane cases from\nKraepelin, and in a supplement a case from Orschansky, (a fourth case, p. 566-7,\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 4S7\nthe premonitory dream was not mentioned or acted upon beforehand,\nwe may proceed with a group of cases, relatively the most numerous of\nall, in which no explanation based on ordinary foresight will satisfy the\nfacts, while yet there is seldom any indication of the agency of any\nspirit beyond the percipient's own. The general scheme is as fol\nlows :\u2014The percipient, usually in dream, but sometimes by voice\nor crystal-vision, is shown a scene or is made aware of a fact in the\nfuture\u2014generally in the near future\u2014which scene afterwards is\nwitnessed or which fact comes true. The scene is generally one from\nhis own coming life, and is often trivial in character.\nThe following case was sent to me by Mrs. Atlay, wife of the late\nBishop of Hereford.\nP. 179.\nMrs. Atlay writes to me as follows :\u2014\nMarch, 1893.\nMy dream was as follows :\u2014\nI dreamt that the Bishop being from home, we were unable to have\nfamily prayers as usual in the chapel, but that I read them in the large\nhall of the Palace, out of which, on one side, a door opens into the dining\nroom. In my dream, prayers being ended, I left the hall, opened the\ndining room door, and there saw, to my horror, standing between the\ntable and the side-board, an enormous pig. The dream was very vivid, and\namused me much. The Bishop being from home, when dressed I went down\ninto the hall to read prayers. The servants had not come in, so I told my\ngoverness and children, who were already there, about my dream, which\namused them as much as it had done me. The servants came in and I read\nprayers, after which the party dispersed. I opened the dining room door,\nwhere, to my amazement, stood the pig in the very spot in which I had\nseen him in my dream. With regard to your question as to whether I\ncould have heard the pig in my sleep, he was then safely in his sty, and my\nroom is quite on the other side of the house, a largo hall dividing our\nside from the servants' side of the house, behind which, in a yard, was the\npig-sty. It got into the dining room in consequence of the gardener being\nengaged in cleaning out the sty while the servants were at prayers ; they\nhardly needs reference), where paranoiacs have believed that all important events had\nbeen predicted to them beforehand. But as Dr. Hodgson points out, (American\nProceedings, p. 543), these cases are not really parallel to the phenomena which\nconcern us. They are, in fact, a form of the common insane delusion of grandeur. A\nfurther reply by Edmund Gurney will be found in Mind for July, 1888. It may\nsuffice here to add that longer experience has continued to inspire distrust of these\nshort cuts, or improvised generalisations, as to habits of memory. Memory may\nsometimes play such tricks as Professor Royce supposes, and may play all kinds of\nother tricks as well, and may, again, be sometimes far more accurate than we are\ndisposed to expect. We must in each instance be fn-shly on the look out for memory's\npossible errors, but the notion of a special track of error in the direction suggested\nby Professor Royce lias not as yet been supported by adequate evidence.\n\f488 F. W. H. Myers.\nhaving left every door open, the pig met with no obstacle on his voyage\nof discovery. Fanny P. Atiay.\nI heard Mrs. Atlay tell the dream when she came into the hall before\nprayers. [Precise date not remembered\u2014atew years ago.]\nEmily Nimmo. (Governess.)\nIn reply to my inquiry whether the pig might not have escaped\nbefore the dream, and have given some indication of proximity to Mrs.\nAtlay's bedroom window, that lady informed me that he only got loose )\nwhile she was reading prayers ;\u2014the gardeners who had been cleaning\nhis sty having left it imperfectly secured. The sty was at a consider\nable distance from the palace. The date of the incident was a few\nyears before the record, but cannot now be precisely ascertained.\nThe next case which I shall quote is, I think, almost unique in our\ncollection in this respect,\u2014that the premonition seems to work its own\nfulfilment, by suggesting the one course of action which, as it happened,\nwould bring about the dreaded experience. It is, of course, possible\nthat the coincidence may have been accidental. Mrs. C. says that she\nis rather a frequent dreamer, although few of her dreams make so\nstrong an impression as the one which I quote, and another with\nsimilar coincidence, which I omit for want of space. 0\nP. 204.\nMrs. C. writes in a letter dated February 29th, 1888, from Holland-road,\nKensington :\u2014\nI have an intense horror of monkeys\u2014I seldom look at one if I can help\nit\u2014they are objects of such antipathy to me ; and I dreamed that I was\npersistently followed by one such as I had never seen before, but which\nterrified me extremely, and from which I could not escape.\nThinking I should be better able to throw off the impression of my\ndream if I told it, I mentioned it to my family, and my husband\nrecommended a short walk. In consequence, and quite contrary to my\ncustom, I arranged to take my children for a short walk, without their nurse\naccompanying me, and as their favourite walk was up Nightingale-lane,\n(Holland-lane), past another lane enclosed by the high walls of Argyll\nLodge, the residence of the Duke of Argyll, I agreed to take them there,\nand when we arrived at Argyll Lodge, what was my horror to see on the\nroof of the coach-house the very monkey of my dreams ! In my surprise\nand terror, I clasped my hands and exclaimed, much to the amazement of a\ncoachman waiting outside, \" My dream ! My dream ' \"\nThis I suppose attracted the attention of the monkey and he began to\ncome after us, he on the top of the wall, we beneath, every minute I\nexpecting he would jump upon me, and having precisely the same terror I\nexperienced in my dream. One of my children being very young we could\nnot go fast, which added to my distress, but we succeeded in escaping it,\nand on my return home I sent a servant to enquire if a monkey had been\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 489\nseen there, for my state of nervousness was extreme. She was informed\nthat that morning a rare and very valuable monkey belonging to the\nDuchess had got loose, and so the incident was explained. But my\ndreaming of it previously remains unexplained. [Signed by Mrs C ]\nIn a subsequent letter dated March 2nd, 1888, Mrs. C. writes :\u2014\nThe \" monkey dream \" was told to at least six persons before I went for\nmy walk, and my children still remember my terror and the \"peculiar\nmonkey \" which followed us.\nMrs. C. also states that the dream occurred in 1867, and sends letters\nof corroboration from her husband and her nurse, which are given below.\nF.

Statement by Colonel K. Coghill.\nApril, 1894.\nA curious case occurred to me last month, though it may be but a\ncoincidence not worth recounting On 28th March I received a letter from\na lady, with whom I had not been in correspondence for about a year, stating\nthat on the 26th she had either a vision or a dream ( I forget the expression)\nthat she saw me in a very dangerous position under a horse, from which\nmany people were trying to relieve me. By return of post I wrote that I\nthought it a dream which was proved by contraries, as nothing of the sort\nhad occurred. That afternoon I received notice of a last \" off day\" with our\npack of hounds, and the next morning on my way to covert I posted my\n( letter. At the finish of a long run in the afternoon, my horse, pulling\ndouble down a steep hill, was unable to collect himself for a big bank at the\nbottom of the hill, breasted it, and fell head over heels into a deep and\nbroad drop ditch on the far side with me underneath him. His head and\nshoulders were at the bottom and legs remained up on the landing side of\nthe ditch. Many of the field dismounted, and after some minutes pulled\nthe horse away, and got me from under, more or less stunned, but little the\nworse, except a few face cuts, the loss of a tooth, and a crushed stirrup, and\nthe horse with a few head cuts. The horse was about my best hunter, and\nnever before guilty of such a thing, though, of course, it may have been but a\nhunting-field coincidence. Kendal Coghill.\nApril, 1894.\n\f490 F. IF. H.

Mrs. Leir-Carleton)\nrelates her dream is unfortunately lost, but Sir Joseph Coghill writes :\u2014\nGlen Barrabane, Castle Townsend, May 3rd, 1894.\nOn the 29th March last, my brother, Colonel Coghill, C.B., showed me\na portion of a letter just received from a lady who wrote describing a dream\nor vision in which she had seen him meet with a serious accident from a\nhorse, and she noticed a crowd of persons assisting him away.\nJ. L. Coghill.\nColonel Coghill writes by return of post, after the receipt of the letter\nrelating the dream, but before the accident, as follows :\u2014\nCosheen, Castle Townsend, Co. Cork, Wednesday, March 28th.\nMy dear Mrs. Carleton,\u2014Need I say how delighted I was to see\nyour handwriting this morning, and how happy I am to say that your dream\nhas so far proved the rule of going by \"contraries,\" for I never in my life was\ngoing stronger than I am at present.\nWriting again on the 31st March, the day after the accident, Colonel\nCoghill says :\u2014\n\"My dear Mrs. Carleton,\u2014You win, hands down. There are two\ngrounds on which we, your friends, have to thank ourselves that you belong\nto the last half of this century\u2014first that we can enjoy your existence and\nfriendship, and secondly that had you lived earlier you might have been\nburnt as a witch, for by your dream you foretold a grief to me, though in\nprospective. Yesterday I enjoyed the imperial crowner which you saw in your\ndream, the hardest fall I have had for very many years. It was the last day of\nour hunt, and I wanted to give a finishing touch to the education of my\nyoung horse. I began the day badly by being on the wrong side of the\nwood when they broke away, and while riding hard to overtake them I topped\na bank and found a chasm too big, so we dropped a crumpler, but I got off with\na broken spur and bent stirrup. After I had overtaken my field, I was pelting\ndown a hill faster than I wanted, and met a stiff bank at the bottom with a\nbroad ditch and a drop on the landing side. The young savage couldn't\ncollect himself in time and struck the bank above his knees.

Con\nsidering that the horse was on my head I can't understand how the only\nthing that gave way was my extreme back tooth, which got smashed and its\nnext neighbour chipped\u2014a few scratches on nose and forehead sums up the\ntotal grief, and cheap at the price. Now will you oblige me, if I am worth\na sleeping, or waking dream in future, to make a pleasanter one of it\u2014for\nthis morning I feel as if a crowbar had replaced my jointy neck, and every\njoint is bound in iron cramps of shoulders, arms, and legs. A few hot baths\n\fThe SxMiminal Self. 491\nand a little massage will put all that right, and as it was the last day of the\nseason, I lose nothing by it. I should not have written all this, but I\nthought that in connection with your dream you might feel an interest in\nits fulfilment.\"\nThe Hon. Mrs. Leir-Carleton, -who experienced this dream, writes from\nGreywell Hill, Winchfield, as follows :\u2014\nFrom my childhood I have had premonitions of illnesses ; sometimes the\nillness proves trivial and sometimes fatal. I have no distinct impressions,\nbut coming events seem to cast shadows before them, which as a child I used\nto term ''fore-feeling,\" and I have not yet found any better word. I have\nheard my Scotch mother, long deceased, relate premonitory dreams of her\nown, so there is probably some hereditary sensitiveness to impressions.\nAfter a few hours or days the gloomy fore-feeling seems to lighten in\nsome cases, as though a threatening \" disagreeable \" had been somehow\naverted. But I can conscientiously affirm that no great sorrow, however\nsudden, has come upon me unpreceded by a premonition of approaching\ntrouble connected with the individual about to suffer or die.\nI have also repeatedly fore-felt the loss of pets neither sick nor old.\nHere again is a case where a somewhat complex scene, involving\nthe action of several persons, is dreamt and narrated beforehand.\nP. 195.\nMr. Haggard of the British Consulate, Trieste, Austria, gives the\nfollowing account of a premonitory dream and its fulfilment :\u2014\nSeptember 21st, 1893.\nA few months ago I had an extraordinarily vivid dream, and waking up\nrepeated it to my wife at once. All I dreamt actually occurred about six\nweeks afterwards, the details of my dream falling out exactly as dreamt.\nThere seems to have been no purpose whatsoever in the dream ; and one\ncannot help thinking, what was the good of it.\nI dreamt that I was asked to dinner by the German Consul General, and\naccepting, was ushered into a large room with trophies of East African arms\non shields against the walls. (N.B.\u2014I have myself been a great deal in\nEast Africa.)\nAfter dinner I went to inspect the arms, and amongst them saw a\nbeautifully gold-mounted sword which I pointed out to the French Vice-\nConsul\u2014who at that moment joined me\u2014as having probably been a present\nfrom the Sultan of Zanzibar to my host the German Consul General.\nAt that moment the Russian Consul came up too. He pointed out how\nsmall was the hilt of the sword and how impossible in consequence it would\nbe for a European to use the weapon, and whilst talking he waved his arm\nin an excited manner over his head as if he was wielding the sword, and to\nillustrate what he was saying.\nAt that moment I woke up and marvelled so at the vividness of the\ndream that I woke my wife up too and told it to her.\nAbout six weeks afterwards my wife and myself were asked to dine with\nthe German Consul General ; but the dream had long been forgotten by\nus both.\n\f492 F. W. H. Myers.\nWe were shown into a large withdrawing room which I had never been\nin before, but which somehow seemed familiar to me. Against the walls\nwere some beautiful trophies of East African arms, amongst which was a\ngold-hilted sword, a gift to my host from the Sultan of Zanzibar.\nTo make a long story short, everything' happened exactly as I had dreamt\n\u2014but I never remembered the dream until the Russian Consul began to\nwave his arm over his head, when it came back to me like a flash.\nWithout saying a word to the Russian Consul and French Vice-Consul\n(whom I left standing before the trophy) I walked quickly across to my wife,\nwho was standing at the entrance of a boudoir opening out of the withdraw\ning room, and said to her;\u2014\"Do you remember my dream about the\nZanzibar arms ? \" She remembered everything perfectly, and was a witness\nto its realization. On the spot we informed all the persons concerned of the\ndream, which naturally much interested them.\nMrs. Haggard's corroboration of her husband's dream and its fulfilment\nruns as follows :\u2014\nI remember being awoke one night by my husband to hear a curiously\nvivid dream he had just had. It is now some months ago, and possibly\nsome of the more minute details of his relation may have escaped my\nmemory, but what I remember of his dream is the following. He dreamed\nthat we were dining with the German Consul General, whose drawing-\nroom, a remarkably handsome apartment, was ornamented with trophies\nof arms from the East Coast of Africa. Having been in those regions\nhimself, he felt some interest in them, and went nearer to examine them '\nmore closely. While he was doing so, the Russian Consul came up, and\nin his usual rather excitable fashion began flourishing his arm, as he\ndilated upon the extraordinary smallness of the native hand for which\nthe hilt of a certain sword must have been designed. That is what I\nrecollect of the dream. Its fulfilment took place a few weeks later, when\nthe circumstance of the dream had almost passed from our thoughts.\nWe dined one evening with the German Consul General, the Russian\nConsul being also present, among others. After dinner my husband went to\nexamine one of the trophies of East African arms, with which the room\u2014as\nin his dream,\u2014was hung. While he was doing so, the Russian Consul went\nup to speak to him upon the subject, and the dramatic flourish of his arm,\nwith which he emphasised his conversation, at once recalled the dream,\nin which it had taken place, so vividly to my husband's mind, that he\nimmediately crossed the room to me, and asked me if I did not remember it\nalso, which of course I did, though, as I was talking to some one else at the\ntime, and only knew the room previously by my husband's description of his\ndream, the coincidence might not have occurred to me had he not called my\nattention to it. Directly he did so, however, by asking me if I did not\nremember his dream, I recollected quite well all the details I have previously\nmentioned. AoneS M Haggard.\nTrieste, October 20th, 1893.\nBelow are given a letter from Mr. Kolemine, Russian Consul, and a state\nment from Herr Michabelles, German Consul General at Trieste, both of\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 493\nwhom were witnesses of the fulfilment of Mr. Haggard's dream, and of the\ngreat impression which it made upon him at the time.\nMonsieur Haggard, mon collegue d'Angleterre, en a eu un tres remar-\nquable au point de vue psychologique.

It was\nthe first time that Mr. Haggard came into my private house ; before we had\nalways met in my office. After dinner I was busy in entertaining my party,\nwhen suddenly Mr. Haggard joined me and told me that a few weeks before\nhe had seen, in a very vivid dream, my drawing-room with the trophies of\nEast African arms on shields against the walls, and Mr. Kolemine, the\nRussian Consul, standing before one trophy had explained something to\nhim in his usual excited manner, waving his arms over his head in order to\nillustrate what he said. All this had happened just at the moment with all\nparticulars seen in the dream. I was extremely astonished at the strange\noccurrence and observed that the realisation of his dream had produced a\nstrong effect on Mr. Haggard's mind.\nJ. MlCHaBelLeS,\nCounsellor of legation in the Foreign Office.\nBerlin, November 10th, 1893.\nIn the next case the gradual accomplishment of the dream seems\nto have been watched with interest by more than one person.\nP. 206.\nThe Rev. B. Dulley, of St. Peter's Clergy House, London Docks, E.,\nsends the following statement, which was written in October, 1893, and is\ncertified to be correct by the percipient, Annette Jones.\nAnnette, wife of Walter Jones, tobacconist, of Old Gravel Lane, St.\nGeorge's, East London, early in September of this year (1893) had her little\nboy, Peter, ill. One night she dreamt that she saw a cart drive up, stop\nnear where she was, and the driver move a black cloth and discover three\ncoffins, two white and one blue. One white coffin was bigger than the other,\nand the blue was the biggest of the three. The man took out the bigger\nwhite coffin and left it, driving off with the two others. In the morning\nMrs. Jones told her dream to her husband, and afterwards to another woman,\nspecially telling her husband that one of the coffins was blue. On the 10th\nof September, Mrs. Devonshire, who, and whose husband were particular\nfriends of the Jones's, was confined with a fine boy, whom they named Eric.\nAt first he seemed quite healthy, but a weakness of the lungs developed\nitself and he died on Friday, the 29th of September. Little Peter Jones died\n2 N\n\f494 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe following Monday, the 2nd of October, being then 16 months old. Mr.\nand Mrs. Jones, knowing that Eric was to be buried on the Wednesday, for\nthe sake of both friendship and economy, hurried their little boy's burial for\nthat day, so that both funerals should take place at the same time. On the\nmorning of the Wednesday, the parish priest informed Mr. and Mr. Jones\nthat another child's body would be brought into church along with theirs,\nthe son of a Mrs. Jupp, whom they did not know.\nMrs. Jones then remarked to her husband, \"If the coffin is blue, then\nmy dream will come true. For the two other coffins were white.\" And so\nit happened. Mrs. Jones anxiously watched at the funeral for little Jupp'\u00bb\ncoffin, and when she saw it was blue, she clutched her sister, who walked by\nher side, and said \" that's my dream.\" It will be noticed that the relative\nsizes of the coffins also corresponded, little Eric's being the smallest for a child\nof a few days, little Jupp's the largest for one about 6 years, and blue, and\nPeter's, of course, less than his but bigger than Eric's.\nI have read the above and find it a true and correct account of my dream\nand the circumstances relating to it.\nAnnette Jones.\nI remember distinctly my wife telling me of her dream, and especially as\nto the colour of the coffins, 2 white and 1 blue, and watched the circumstances\nwhich occurred afterwards with something like awe.\nWalter H. Jones.\nThe Rev. B. Dulley states in a letter dated January 6th, 1894 :\u2014\nMr. Jones is a particularly common-sense practical man with abilities\nin that respect above the average. So far from welcoming the preternatural\nevent noted, he is rather vexed and worried by it. Both he and his wife are\nconscientious people, and certainly believe what they say.\nB. Duiiey, Clerk in Holy Orders.\nIn some other cases the premonitory dream, although it may have\nmade a vivid impression, and perhaps have even been narrated to others,\nis then apparently clean forgotten until the moment of its fulfilment.\nMrs. Sidgwick has justly urged (of a similar case) that this looks\nrather as though we were dealing with a pseudo-memory, created by\nthe very circumstance which seems merely to revive it. There may,\nhowever, be another explanation. We know that when a suggestion is\ngiven to a good subject in the hypnotic trance to the effect that he will\n(say) open the window half an-hour after awaking, he passes that half-\nhour in unconsciousness of the order,\u2014which order nevertheless he fulfils\nat the right minute. Well, while he is thus fulfilling it, or just before\nhe fulfils it, he lapses into a state more akin to the hypnotic state in\nwhich he received the order than to the waking state in which he has\nsince remained. The memory of what he has to do comes to him only\njust in time, and derives its efficacy from a partial recrudescence of the\ncondition in which he was when he accepted the order. Even thus,\nperhaps, we might by analogy consider the condition of the dreamer of\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 495\na precognitive dream as a secondary state, the recollection of which has\na tendency to fade from the waking mind, but which is partially\nrevived when the prefigured incident,\u2014 which belongs in a sense to the\nsecondary state,\u2014suddenly presents itself in the waking day.\nBearing this in mind, the following prevision of a rattle-snake may\nbe compared with the prevision of a woodcock which Mrs. Sidgwick\nquotes. Observe that in this case, although Dr. Kinsolving did not\nactually recount his dream before the event, he remembers having\nthought of doing so, but refrained from a natural scruple.\nP. 149.\nDr. Kinsolving of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Epiphany,\nPhiladelphia, writes as follows to Dr. Hodgson :\u2014\n2016, Locust-street, Philadelphia,\nOctober lUh, 1891.\nMy Dear Sir, \u2014The dream was this. I seemed to be in woods back of\nthe hotel at Capon Springs, W. Va., when I came across a rattle-snake,\nwhich when killed had two black-looking rattles and a peculiar projection of\nbone from the tail, while the skin was unusually light in colour. The\nimpression of the snake was very distinct and vivid before my mind's eye\nwhen I awoke in the morning, but I did not mention the dream to any one,\nthough I was in the act of telling my wife while dressing, but refrained from\nso doing because I was in the habit of taking long walks in the mountains,\nand I did not wish to make her nervous by the suggestion of snakes.\nAfter breakfast, I started with my brother along the back of the great\nnorth mountain, and when about twelve miles from the hotel we decided to\ngo down out of the mountain into the road and return home. As we started\ndown the side of the mountain I suddenly became vividly conscious of my\ndream, to such an extent as to startle me, and to put me on the alert. I\nwas walking rapidly, and had gone about thirty steps, when I came on a\nsnake coiled and ready to strike. My foot was in the air and had I finished\nmy step I would have trodden upon the snake. I threw myself to one side and\nfell heavily on the ground. I recovered myself at once and killed the snake\nwith the assistance of my brother, and found it to be the same snake in\nevery particular with the one I had had in my mind's eye. The same size,\ncolour, and peculiar mal-formation of the tail.\nIt is my belief that my dream prevented me from treading on the snake,\nbut I have no theory on the subject, and get considerably mixed and\nmuddled when I try to think on the line of such abnormal experiences.\nG. H. Kinsolving.\nChrist Church, Clinton and Harrison Sts.,\n323, Clinton-street, Brooklyn, N.Y.\nApril 19th, 1892.\nMr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014My Dear Sir,\u2014My brother, the Rev. Geo.\nH. Kinsolving, of Philadelphia, has enclosed me your request for my\n2 n 2\n\f496 F. W. H. Myers.\nrecollection of his premonitory dream last summer at Capon Springs.\nConstant occupation during the season just ended is my apology for a\nsomewhat tardy compliance with that request. The circumstances as I\nremember them were these :\u2014\nWe started, he and I together, off from the Springs Hotel just after\nbreakfast to go over the mountain to Rock Enon Springs. Our first stop was\non the crest of the North Mountain and near it we had some conversation\nwith two boys who were out huckleberrying. I asked them about their\nexperience with rattle-snakes, and they replied that they had killed several\nduring the season. Later, my brother and I were clambering up a steep,\nrough, bushy cliff and as he was in front I said, \" You had better look out\nfor rattle-snakes. This is a very snaky sort of place.\" At neither of these\nreferences to the subject of the snakes did my brother seem to be reminded\nof or make any allusion to his dream of the night before of which he had not\nthen told me.\nAfter walking some way beyond this we missed our trail and found our\nselves descending the mountain. Suddenly my brother, who was at my side\nand a little in front, threw his body back and said, '' My ! I like to have stepped\non that fellow ! \" I think I caught him by the shoulder as, with one foot\nraised just over the reptile which was coiled under some bushes and a bit of\nbrushwood, he reeled backward. Then as we closed in upon the snake and\ndelivered our first stones, my brother catching sight of his tail said, \" That\nis strange ! I will tell you something remarkable about that snake in a\nmoment.\" Then when we had killed the snake, before I had noticed any\nthing remarkable about it\u2014when to me it was like Jim Smiley's frog, \"just\nlike any other frog \"\u2014my brother pointed to the fact that it had but one\nrattle on its tail, and proceeded to tell me his dream. He said that the night\nbefore he dreamed that he came up in the front of the Springs Hotel as a\nparty of boys were in the act of killing a snake. Bending over the reptile he\nsaid, \" Why, boys, that snake has a diseased tail.\" And on examination it\nappeared a very singular, defective tail. At the time of his narrow escape\nfrom being bitten (for the reptile had thrown back his head to strike when\ndiscovered), he said the dream had suddenly come into his mind. I noticed\na pause and losing the thread of the argument in which we were engaged, and\nthis made me look towards him at the moment. He answered there on the\nspot to my question why he had not told me the strange dream when I\nmentioned snakes as we clambered up the peak or when we were speaking\nwith the boys, that he had not thought of the dream during our walk until a\n\u00bbmoment before this snake was met and that at that moment the dream had\ncome into his mind with such vividness as to make him look where he was\nwalking with some care.\nThe snake was large enough to have had half-a-dozen or more rattles. It\nhad a single rattle\u2014not a button\u2014and looked as though disease or crushing\nor some unusual accident had deprived it of the rest.\nThese are the facts, as I remember them, very hastily narrated. The\nexperience was altogether unique for me at least. I will send you this\ndirect without having spoken to [my brother] of the experience since leaving\nthe Springs in the month of August last.\nArthtr B. Kinsolving.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 497\nThe following case, from a lady known to me, is interesting in\nthis connexion ; since a dream is at first remembered so impressively\nas to affect action, is then apparently forgotten, and finally revives\nin memory just in time to enable the dreamer to avert its complete\nfulfilment.\nP. 185.\nOn the second occasion my warning in dream did probably prevent a\ni rather serious accident. We were living in about 188\u2014, in Hertford-street,\nMayfair. One day I determined that on the morrow I would drive to Wool\nwich in our brougham, taking my little child and nurse, to spend the day\nwith a relation. During the night I had a painfully clear dream in vision of\nthe brougham turning up one of the streets north of Piccadilly ; and then of\nmyself standing on the payment and holding my child, our old coachman fall\ning on his head on the road,\u2014his hat smashed in. This so much discomposed\nme that when in the morning I sent for the coachman to give him his orders,\nI almost hoped that some obstacle to the drive might arise, so that I might\nhave an excuse for going by train. The coachman was an old and valued\nservant. I asked him if ho would have the carriage ready to drive to Wool\nwich at ten. He was not given to making difficulties ; but he hesitated,\nand when I suggested eleven instead, he said that he would prefer that hour.\nHe gave no reason for his hesitation and said that the horse was quite well.\nI told him almost eagerly that I could quite well go by train ; but he said\nthat all was right.\nWe went to Woolwich and spent the day. All went well until we reached\nPiccadilly on the return journey. Then I saw that other coachmen were\nlooking at us ; and looking through the glass front of the brougham I saw\nthat the coachman was leaning back in his seat, as though the horse were\npulling violently, of which, however, I felt no sign. We turned up Down-\nstreet. He retained his attitude. My dream flashed back upon me. I\ncalled to him to stop, jumped out, caught hold of my child, and called to a\npoliceman to catch the coachman. Just as he did so the coachman swayed\nand fell off the box. If I had been in the least less prompt, he would have\nfallen just as I saw him in my dream. I found afterwards that the poor man\nhad been suffering from a serious attack of diarrhoea on the previous day, and\nhad gradually fainted from exhaustion during the drive home. He was\nabsolutely sober ; and his only mistake had been in thinking that he was\nstrong enough to undertake the long drive. In this case my premonitory\ndream differed from the reality in two points. In my dream we approached\nDown-street from the west ; in reality we came from the east. In my\ndream the coachman actually fell on his head ; the crushing of his hat\non the road being the most vivid point of the dream. In reality this\nwas just averted by the prompt action which my anxious memory of the\ndream inspired.\nSigned [Lady Z.]\nThe aversion of the fulfilment, by reasonable precaution, is here an\nimportant feature. Another dream of the same lady's presents us with\n\f498 F. W. H. Myers.\na fatal fulfilment occurring in spite of the dreamer's aroused anxiety.\nBut in that case no precautions were taken\u2014nor indeed could they\nhave been easily taken,\u2014to avert the calamity.\nP. 184.\nI am not usually a great dreamer ; but on two occasions, and two occasions\nonly in my life, I have acted on dreams or impressions, and in each case there\nseems to have been some meaning in the impression which I received.\nIn or about the year 1866, Lord Z. and I were inhabiting a house in\nCharles-street, Mayfair. We had built out a bedroom into the small court\nbehind. This bedroom was separated only by a narrow passage or strip of\ncourt from our neighbour, Mrs. L's kitchen, which was built out into the\ncourt in the same fashion, and was of one story only.\nIn the middle of a very cold night I was suddenly awakened by a heavy\nfall into this passage outside our bedroom wall, as if some heavy body had\nfallen into it from the roof of Mrs. L.'s kitchen. I listened, much alarmed,\nand heard groans from the passage. I thought that some burglar had slipped\nfrom the kitchen roof down on to the pavement and was lying there injured.\nI begged Lord Z. to get up and look ; but he could hear nothing, and told\nme that I had been dreaming. I went to sleep again at length ; but was\nagain awakened by a similar thud in the passage. I now begged Lord Z. so\nearnestly to look that he got up and partially dressed and opened a door on\nthe ground floor which led into this passage. The moon was shining brightly,\nand there was no trace whatever of anything unusual. Much perplexed I P\nagain went to sleep. After I had left the bedroom in the morning, a servant\ncame to ask me whether he might get ready a bedroom to receive a workman\nwho had come to work on the roof of Mrs. L.'s kitchen, and had fallen into\nthe passage from the kitchen-roof just as I had thought that I heard a man\nfall some few hours previously.\nThe premonition, if such it was, was here of no special use. It seemed\nas though I had received an intimation of a coming fact which only con\ncerned me by its mere physical nearness.\nSigned [Lady Z.]\n[Lord Z. is no longer living.]\nA case very similar to this reaches us from America. Dr. Hodgson\nknows Mrs. P. and Dr. Lukens, and has examined Dr. Lukens's notes\nthroughout.\nP- 214- Metuchen, N.J. , March 12th, [1892].\nProf. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014About the time this reaches you, you will\nreceive a \"Fulfilled Prediction,\" written by me and signed by four others.\nThe fifth witness is ill in Brooklyn, but I can procure her attestation should\nyou desire it. I am the sixth\u2014the seventh is in \" The Great Beyond.\" All\nthese heard the prediction repeatedly.\nI lay stress on this incident because of my impression of the accident\nseveral weeks before it took place, and because in no way that I can see\ncould it have been photographed upon the ether 6e\/ore it took place. Unless,\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 499\nindeed, our innermost, the spiritual essence, being at one with the Universal\nSpirit, foresees the future as part of the Eternal whole.\nSome curious facts I did not incorporate in the statement, because they\ncould not be vouched for by the witnesses. For instance, Mr. Collins, to\nwhom the fatal accident happened, was asked by Mr. Van Horn (the hus\nband of the last signer to the document which she will forward to you) to re\nmove the snow from the roof as described. The roof was a small conserva\ntory extending from the main dwelling. This he did as requested. Then he\nbegan to clear the ice from the gutter at his own monition, though remon-\n\u2022 strated with and strictly charged to be careful lest he should fall, by Mr. Van\nHorn, his employer. You will see the pertinence of this fact by comparing\nthis statement with that which is, or will be, forwarded to you by Mrs. Van\nHorn.\nH. M. P.\nA Fulfilled Prediction.\nIn the winter of 1886 and 1887, I was living at West 29th Street, New\nYork City. In company with six friends I used to sit one hour each week,\nnot for \" spiritual manifestations \" but for the purpose of harmonising our\nselves and for the cultivation of sensibility to psychic impressions.\nDuring these meetings several strong presentiments of future occurrences\ncame to me (Mrs. H. M. P.), which were subsequently verified.\nOne of the more marked was the following :.\u2014\nI distinctly felt that a serious accident would shortly happen to some per\nson in or about the back portion of the residence. There would be a fearful\nfall of some elderly man.\nNow in the house were two elderly men, but I foresaw that the accident\nwould happen to neither of these.\nAgain and again as we sat within our quiet room, did the impression of\nthis terrible fall come to me, as those present clearly remember. At such\ntimes the horror was strong and persistent. In consequence we even talked\nof having a lamp constantly burning on the hall of the basement staircase\nlest one might make a misstep there. But I could not locate the place where\nthe fall would happen.\nIn the late winter of 1887 there occurred a heavy rain followed by a sud\nden freeze. In consequence the rain-gutter of the rear roof became clogged\nwith ice which it seemed desirable should bo cleared away.\nIn order to do this a man, between sixty and seventy years of age, Thomas\n- Collins by name\u2014the foreman of a number of men employed by the husband\nof one of us\u2014volunteered to remove the ice. It is needless to say that none\nof our number knew anything of what he was about to do.\nAccordingly Mr. Collins, a man of large experience, caution, and intelli\ngence, with hatchet in hand mounted a ladder placed against the eaves of\nthe roof. The ladder slipped as he reached the top, and he, with it, fell to\nthe stone paving of the area. Mr. Collins struck upon his head causing\nfracture of the skull. He was removed to the hospital, where he died in a\nfew hours without having recovered consciousness.\nThe first impression or foreshadowing of this accident was between two\nand three months before its occurrence.\nH.

M. P. made the following\nprediction. \"I see Dr. Anna Lukens receive a letter announcing a death.\nYou (to Dr. A. L.) will soon hear of the death of some one connected with\nyou\u2014not very closely ; but the news will be something of a shock and a\ngreat surprise, but it is not a death that will touch you closely.\"\nThe following persons were present (at 1,068, Lexington Avenue, New\nYork City) when the prediction was made.\nDr. Anna Lukens.\nH.

The off horse shied badly, threw the carriage\noff on the side of the road, nearly upsetting it, and then both horses\ntried to run away.

Algonquin Club, Boston.\nDecember 27th, 1893.\nRichard Hoooson, LL.D.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I enclose to you herewith a\nvery curious story told me by my friend, Mr. W. H. M. [name and\naddress given], Boston. I am afraid that strong corroborative evidence\ncannot now be secured from persons to whom Mr. M. may have told his\n\"dream \" before he went to Reading. He thinks that he mentioned having\nhad a very vivid dream to his fiancee, now his wife, and that his mother,\n, now dead, knew of the dream at the time. He did not talk very freely\nabout the affair, because he did not care to expose himself to the ridicule of\nhis friends.\nI know him very well. He is a brusque, practical, every-day young\nman, of large business experience, and apparently very far removed by\nnature and environment from susceptibility to hallucination. I believe in\nhis truthfulness and honesty in this matter most implicitly.\nIt may be well to say that I have not attempted to secure evidence of\nthe correctness of topographical details from Reading ; also, that at the\ntime of his dream, Mr. M. had in his possession no letter from that city,\nnor any friends nor business relations in or with the place, and his trip to\nReading in the following autumn was purely the result of sudden exigency.\nHe went to Philadelphia, I believe, to meet a friend, found he had gone to\nReading, and followed him thither.\nCharles Heywood.\nMr. W. H. M. awoke one morning, probably in August, 1884, and\nproceeded, as was his habit, to plunge his head into cold water. At this,\nthe recollection flashed across his mind of a dream he had had during the\nnight. He had seemed to be in a strange city, in a square at the inter\nsection of several streets. Between two of the streets was a building with\nthis sign upon it, \"John Leyden (or Layton), Hay and Grain, Coal and\nWood.\" The vision made such an impression upon him that he remembered\nit during the summer. In the following October he visited Reading, Pa.,\nfor the first time in his life. Arriving after dark and being unfamiliar with\nthe city, he enquired the way to the nearest respectable hotel, and there put\nupfor the night. In the morning he opened his window and looked out upon\n\f502 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe square seen in his dream, corresponding in every detail, even to the bale\nof hay and the bags of grain at the door of the store.\nThe above statement is as nearly correct as I can now recall it.\nW. H. M.\nFebruary 12th, 1894.\nRichard Hodgson, LL.D.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I have your letter of the 8th,\nand in reply would say that my friend Heywood's account of my \"dream\"\nis as I recall it now. I am a civil engineer, and at the time of the occurr\nence I was Principal Assistant Engineer of the Boston and Providence R.R.\nMy seventeen years of business life have been actively spent in the practice\nof my profession and in general contracting, and until this thing happened\nI had always regarded anything of like nature as a delusion or a trick.\nUnder these circumstances, I think you will understand why I didn't\nmention the matter to my friends. I told my mother something of it\n'before I went away,\u2014in fact, a day or so after the dream,\u2014but as she died\nOctober 26th, 1893, that avenue of investigation is closed. My (at that\ntime) fiancee lived in Burlington, Vt., and on visiting her soon after my\ntrip to Reading, Pa., I told her of the matter. She is now my wife, and\nrecalls the affair, but I am afraid this is not good evidence, nor have I any\nother. The man 1 went to see died about 1885 or 1886, though I learned\nthis only three years ago.\nI am sorry not to be able to furnish corroborative evidence of this\nmatter, as I would like to have it explained. I had never been in Reading ^\ntill that time, nor have I been there since.\nThe matter bothered me so much at the time that it almost demoralized\nme. I couldn't get it out of my mind. There is one more thing which I\nwould like an explanation of. It used to bother me, but I am quite used to\nit now. Since I was a young boy, I have been frequently surprised to find\nmyself saying in conversation combinations of words which I recognize as\nhaving dreamt of, or unconsciously thought of.

R. M. (Address given.)\nThe prefigured scenes which I have thus far quoted, whether in\nthemselves trivial or otherwise, have mainly been drawn from the\nimpending actual personal experience of the seer himself. But in tlie\ncase (for instance) of the fall from the kitchen roof, it is noticeable\ni that Lady Z. did not herself actually hear the fall, although she\nwould have heard it had she still remained in her bedroom, where she\nheard the premonitory sound. Something then was prefigured which\nlay just outside her own life-history.\nWe have some other cases of like type, as, for instance, the follow\ning crystal vision seen by Miss X., in direct response (a very rare\ncircumstance) to a request for information on a specific point. Other\npremonitions of Miss X.'s have already appeared in these Proceedings.\nP. 183.\nExtract from \" Borderland \" on \"The Art of Crystal-gazing.\" October,\n1893.\nA week or two ago I was visiting friends in the country, and was about\nto leave their house on a certain morning. \" I wonder what you will do after\nI'm gone,\" I was saying.\nFor answer, one of them pulled towards me a piece of bright mahogany\nfurniture brilliantly polished, and said, \" Here is a crystal\u2014look.\"\n\" This is the pic-nic you said you were all going to at Pin Mill, I suppose,\"\nI said pleasantly, as a picture appeared. \"What and where is Pin Mill?\nThere is no sign of a mill\u2014it is just a grassy bank with some thorn-bushes\nbeyond.

We sat on a bank, K. had cramp and I had to take\nher for a walk, G. and S. were left together. G. had sprained her back and\nwas in some pain, and the nurse and boy were there. The were no thorn-\ntrees, but there were elder and blackberry-bushes grown up high, which at a\nlittle distance looked like thorns.\" [I have seen this letter.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nSimilarly trivial in the foreshown details is the following case from\nthe Annates des Sciences Psychiques.\nP. 207. The Rivanazzaro Case.\nLetter to M. Charles Richet.\nApril 17th, 1891.\nMy Dear Colleague, \u2014You ask me to send you my case of telepathy. It\nis a story of my youth, and consequently an old story ; I formerly told it to\nM. Sabatier, of Montpellier. Here it is, if it interests you : \u2014\n\f504 F. W. H. Myers.\nDuring the summer of 1867, I was officially the assistant, but in reality\nthe friend, in spite of difference in age, of M. F., a former officer in the navy,\nwho had gone into business. We were trying to set on foot again the\nexploitation of an old sulphur mine at Rivanazzaro, near Voghera, in Pied\nmont, which had been long abandoned on account of a falling in.\nWe occupied the same rooms, and our relations were those of father and\nson, or of elder and younger brother.\nI have often gone over, in memory, the story I am about to tell you ; I\nhave studied it with my scientific habits, without finding the least explana\ntion. Nevertheless, before owning my absolute inability to arrange the facts\nin any method at all in accordance with those to which my profession\nhabituates me,\u2014measures, figures, experiments,\u2014I have searched for all\nthe accessory circumstances which might have influenced the phenomenon.\nThough I have not been able to come to a conclusion, more competent\npersons may do so.\nI knew that Madame F., who lived at Toulon, and with whom I was\nslightly acquainted, would soon be confined. I cannot say I was indifferent\nabout this fact, for it concerned M. F. ; but it certainly caused me no pro\nfound emotion ; it was a second child, all was going wellt and M. F. was not\nanxious. I myself was well and calm. It is true that a few days before, in\nBurgundy, my mother had fallen out of a carriage ; but the fall had no bad\nconsequences, and the letter which informed me of it also told me there was\nno harm done.\nM. F. and I slept in adjoining rooms, and as it was hot we left the door f\nbetween them open. One morning I sprang suddenly out of bed, crossed\nmy room, entered that of M. F., and awakened him by crying out, \"you\nhave just got a little girl ; the telegram says. . . .\" Upon this I began\nto read the telegram. M. F. sat up and listened ; but all at once I under\nstood that I had been asleep, and that consequently my telegram was only a\ndream, not to be believed ; and then, at the same time, this telegram which\nwas somehow in my hand and of which I had read about three lines aloud,\nword for word, seemed to withdraw from my eyes as if some one were carrying\nit off open ; the words disappeared, though their image still remained ; those\nwhich I had pronoimced remained in my memory, while the rest of the tele\ngram was only a form.\nI stammered something ; M. F. got up and led me into the dining-room,\nand made me write down the words I had pronounced ; when I came to the\nlines which, though they had disappeared from my memory, still remained\npictured in my eye, I replaced them by dots, making a sort of drawing of\nthem. Remark that the telegram was not written in common terms ; there\nwere about six lines of it, and I had read more than two of them. Then,\nbecoming aware of our rather incorrect costume, M. F. and I began to laugh,\nand went back to our beds.\nTwo or three days after I left for Toree ; I tried in vain to remember the\nrest of the telegram ; I went on to Turin, and eight or ten days after my\ndream I received the following telegram from M. F., \" Come directly, you\nwere right.\"\nI returned to Rivanazzaro and M. F. showed me a telegram which he had\nreceived the evening before ; I recognised it as the one I had seen in my\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 505\ndream ; the beginning was exactly what I had written, and the end, which\nwas exactly like my drawing, enabled me to read again the words which I\nsaw again. Please remark that the confinement had taken place the even\ning before, and therefore the fact was not that I, being in Italy, had seen a\ntelegram which already existed in France\u2014this I might with some difficulty\nhave understood\u2014but that I had seen it ten days before it existed or\ncould hare existed ; since the event it announced had not yet taken place.\nI have turned this phenomenon over in my memory and reasoned about it\nmany times, trying to explain it, to connect it with something, with a pre\nvious conversation, with some mental tension, with an analogy, a wish,\u2014and\nall in vain. M. F. is dead, and the paper I wrote has disappeared. If I\nwere called before a court of justice about it, I could not furnish the shadow\nof a material proof, and again the two personalities which exist in me, the\nanimal and the savant, have disputed on this subject so often that sometimes\nI doubt it myself. However, the animal, obstinate as an animal usually is,\nrepeats incessantly that I have seen, and I have read, and it is useless for me\nto tell myself that if any one else told me such a story I should not believe\nit. I am obliged to admit that it happened.\nJ. THOrilet.\nProfessor at the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences at Nancy.\nM. Thoulet has lately confirmed all the details contained in his letter.\nHe has no longer any written trace of this old story, but the recollection of\nit is perfectly clear. He assured me that he had seen and read the telegram\nlike a real object.\nThe delicate point of this striking experience so carefully (if a little\ntardily) reported, would be to know exactly what degree of resemblance\nexisted between the real telegram and the visionarytelegram which M. Thoulet\nhad read ten days before. But even if the identity was not as great as M.\nThoulet now thinks, the analogy must yet have been striking, and the origin\nof this astonishing hallucination and clairvoyant premonition is most extra\nordinary.\nCh. R.\nIt is, of course, possible that the expectant mother had amused\nherself by composing telegrams to be used in case of the birth of a boy\nor of a girl, so that telepathy may have been at work here.\nIn the case next quoted the prefigured scene lies still further from\nthe percipient's own experience ; belonging to the private life of a man\nknown to her only by sight, and in whom she took no interest.\nP. 198.\nFrom Mr. Alfred Cooper, of 9, Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, W.\nThis account was orally confirmed by him to Mr. E. Gurney, June 6th,\n1888. It is written by Mr. Cooper, but attested also by the Duchess of\nHamilton.\nA fortnight before the death of the late Earl of L\u2014, in 1882, I called\nupon the Duke of Hamilton, in Hill Street, to see him professionally. After\n\f506 F. W. H. Myers.\nI had finished seeing him we went into the drawing-room, where the Duchess\nwas, and the Duke said to me, \" Oh, Cooper ; how is the Earl ? \"\nThe Duchess said, \" What Earl t \" and on my answering \" Lord L\u2014,\"\nshe replied \" That is very odd. I have had a most extraordinary vision. I\nwent to bed, but after being in bed a short time, I was not exactly asleep,\nbut thought I saw a scene as if from a play before me. The actors in it were\nLord L\u2014, in a chair, as if in a fit, with a man standing over him with a red\nbeard. He was by the side of a bath, over which bath a red lamp was dis\ntinctly shown.\"\nI then said, \"I am attending Lord L\u2014 at present ; there is very little\nthe matter with him ; he is not going to die ; he will be all right very\nsoon.\"\nWell, he got better for a week and was nearly well, but at the end of six\nor seven days after this I was called to see him suddenly. He had inflam\nmation of both lungs.\nI called in Sir William Jenner, but in six days he was a dead man. There\nwere two male nurses attending on him ; one had been taken ill. But when\nI saw the other the dream of the Duchess was exactly represented. He was\nstanding near a bath over the Earl and, strange to say, his beard was red.\nThere was the bath with the red lamp over it. It is rather rare to\nfind a bath with a red lamp over it, and this brought the story to my\nmind.\nThe vision seen by the Duchess was told two weeks before the death of\nLord L\u2014. It is a most remarkable thing.\nThis account, written in 1888, has been revised by the [late] Duke of\nManchester, father of the Duchess of Hamilton, who heard the vision from\nhis daughter on the morning after she had seen it.\nSigned Mary Hamilton.\nAlfred Cooper.\nHer Grace had been reading and had just blown out the candle.\nHer Grace has had many dreams which have come true years after.\nAlfred Cooper.\n[The Duchess only knew Lord L\u2014 by sight, and had not heard that\nhe was ill. She knew she was not asleep, for she opened her eyes to get\nrid of the vision and, shutting them, saw the same thing again.]\nAn independent and concordant account has been given to me\norally by a gentleman to whom the Duchess related the dream on\nthe morning after its occurrence.\nIn the two cases which follow, we find a specially interesting form\nof gradual emergence. The percipient is for some time rendered\nanxious, as though by a dim precognition of an accident which no one\ncould ordinarily foresee, and then when the moment of crisis actually\narrives a telepathic shock transmits the scene\u2014in one case to the\npercipient already affected, in the other case (though incorrectly) to\nhis wife\u2014along with an increment of his own dim distress.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 507\nP. 164. T. F. Lekch, M.D.\nIndiana Slate Medical Society.\nOffice of the Vice-President,\nCrawfordsville, Ind., August 14th, 1893.\nRichard Hodgson, LL.D.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I will say that I suffer from\nchronic rheumatism, and at times become a little nervous, caused by\npain, loss of sleep, and worry about business, &c., &c. While in that con\ndition I had the experiences to which you refer. My two sons, Ellerslie and\nCharlie, had been interested in establishing Sons of Virginia camps through\nout the country [in June, 1892], and would occasionally ask to drive my\nhorse and buggy on their nightly visit to different villages. I thought nor\ncared anything for it, until one evening at the supper table Ellerslie said,\n\" Papa, I want to go to Mace to-night.\" Mace is six miles east, and there\nis a good gravel road leading to it. When he spoke, it flashed through me\nthat on the way home something would happen to him. I thought of foot\npads, sudden illness, and the like. However, without making known my\nfears, I asked who was going with him. He answered, \"No one.\" I told\nhim to take Charlie along. He said Charlie had an examination the next\nday at College, and couldn't go. I told him to get Bart Griffith, a brother\nS. of V. He went to see G., and on returning, told me G. couldn't go, he\nhad an examination also. I told him he ought to get some one. He said\nhe couldn't. I tried to throw off my fears and started to my office. On\nthe way I saw a young man, Arthur Wellington, and asked him to go with\nmy son. He said he would. I took him to Ellerslie and said, \" Arthur will\ngo with you.\" He answered, \"All right,\" and I dismissed the whole thing,\nfears and all, from my mind\u2014at least, I thought I had.\nI was busy at the office until nine o'clock, when I went home. My wife\nhad retired. I got in bed, read a while, turned out the light and went to\nsleep, having forgotten that my son was away with the horse and buggy.\nAbout eleven o'clock I awoke with a start and sat up in bed. I had seen,\nbefore waking, Ellerslie driving along, alone in the buggy, the horse trotting\nslowly, one mile out of Crawfordsville. I saw the exact spot and recognised\nit, so I could have gone to it. In addition, I saw the lightning come down\nand strike in the middle of the road about 50 feet in front of the horse. My\nfirst impulse was to go up there. I remembered then that Ellerslie had gone\nto Mace, and, as I supposed, taken Arthur W with him. I tried hard\nto reason myself out of the alarm into which I had been thrown. I first\nthought I would hitch up and drive up to the scene of the lightning stroke\nand see if E. was hurt ; then I remembered that I hadn't any horse. I\nthought, \" They both certainly are not hurt, or at least, the horse will come\nhome, &c.,\" but my fears had too deep a hold on me. I awoke my wife and\nasked her if Arthur went with Ellerslie. She said, no ; there was no place\nfor him to stay during the meeting of the camp, and he concluded not to go.\nIn the midst of my worry Ellerslie came in, and I dismissed the whole thing\nand went to sleep without telling any one.\nAt the breakfast-table Ellerslie said, \"I saw something last night that\nscared me.\" On being asked what it was, he said, \" While I was coming\nhome, I saw the lightning come down the road right in front of me, and all\nspill over the ground. It looked like it had been poured out of something\n\f508 F. W. H. Myers.\nand spilled all around on the ground. It scared me.\" \"Did it scare the\nhorse ? \" some one asked. \" He stopped, and T gave him a cut and told him\nto get up. It was the prettiest sight I ever saw, it beat any fireworks.\" I\nasked him if he was alone and was he driving in a trot. He said he was. At\nnoon of that day I asked him where he was when the lightning struck. He\ntold me, and it was the place I saw in my sleep. I then told my family of\nmy experience. It was strange that I should have taken alarm at the mention\nof his going, and also felt that he would be on his way home, when he would\nbe exposed to danger ; that I should have forgotten entirely that he was\naway\u2014I generally can't go to sleep if any of the family is out ; that I should\nsee him in the buggy alone, the horse trotting, the exact location in the road,\nthe lightning come down just where and how he described it ; and when he\ntold about it, I felt that I had been there and saw it. It was all now to me,\nand while I may have had fears of impending danger sometimes in my life,\nI don't remember such a remarkable succession of coincidences happening\nin my experience.\nOne day, shortly after the above described incident, soon after dinner, I\nwas seated in my front room watching a game of Halma, played by the chil\ndren and some company that was visiting us, when I had a feeling that there\nwas a building on fire near by.\nI felt so certain of it, that I could hardly restrain myself from, going out\nto see if it was the barn. Then it occurred to me that it might be the\nhouse. I thought the people on the street would see it and cry \"fire\"\nif it was. I didn't want any one to know I had such a feeling, and was\nholding myself still, when the fire bell rang, and I said to myself, \"there it\nis.\" To get out doors without any ado, I said, we must seethe horses run.\nOn opening the door Miss Bess Smith, sitting in a buggy, said, \" Look at\nthe school-house, it is all on fire in the cupola ! \" My own house and\nother houses were between me and the fire when I received the impres\nsion, making it impossible for me to see the school-house. Was it a co\nincidence ? It was the Central school building, three stories high, and\nburned down, entailing a groat loss in money as well as great inconvenience\nto the schools.\nT. F.

Forney, Tex., February 1st, 1894.\nProf. William James,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014Replying to your request, I find it\nhard for me to present to you the \"premonition \" as it impressed me.\nIn the first place I will state that I am, or have been, in perfect health.\nI am not in the least superstitious and am not subject to hallucinations, and\nhave never taken but little interest in the investigation of such phenomena.\nThree years ago last December my son, then eighteen years of age, left\nhome to accept a position in a drug house in an adjoining county. I was\nperfectly willing for him to go, and never felt a moment's uneasiness about\nhim. Last summer I took an extended trip east and was gone some time.\nDuring my absence I never once felt the least apprehension about my son or\nany member of my family. I am naturally of a buoyant disposition. Some\ntime last fall, in a vague and indescribable way, I became dissatisfied about\nmy son. I can't say I was uneasy\u2014only dissatisfied\u2014though I cannot tell\nwhy. I wrote him several letters,\u2014more than I had written him the entire\nthree years of his absence. Early in November he came home on a visit,\nand after he left, I seemed to get more troubled and dissatisfied about him ;\nit was not uneasiness or apprehension as to any danger, simply I was dis\nsatisfied and troubled about him. I cannot explain my feelings. As near\nas I can remember, I felt just as I did after my father's death, when I was\nquite a small boy. It seemed that the light had suddenly gone out of my\nlife and there was nothing left for me to live for. A weight like a mill-stone\nseemed crushing out my life. I remarked often to my friends that living\nseemed to have lost its attraction for me. As December wore along this feel\ning became intensified, and in some way my son seemed to be the centre of\nit all. Often I would awake in the night thinking about him, and so\nimpressed with the emptiness and hollowness of life that I could not sleep.\nOn the morning of the 19th of December I awoke some time before day. It\nseemed that I had reached a crisis. I got up and kindled a fire without dis\nturbing any member of my family. In all my life I do not remember ever\ndoing such a thing before. I sat down by the fire to think. I cannot\nexplain the awful weight that oppressed me. I did not know what it was,\nnor what was the matter with me, yet in no way did I anticipate trouble or\ndanger to my son. About 7 a.m. my wife awoke, and sitting in the bed,\ntold me a dream that was strangely impressing her, \u2014in fact it caused her to\nawake.\n\"I thought,\" she said, \"that you were in a strange place and among\npeople I had never seen before. It was a large family of people, with several\nsmall children who were going to school and a grown-up daughter. I came to\nthe place in a wagon, but you were there already. I thought you were very\nintimate with the family. The large girl sat in your lap and put her arms\nround your neck and kissed you repeatedly. While I was wondering where\nyou had met these people to become so intimate with them, you suddenly\ndropped over and died. And I awoke.\"\nI replied to her that I felt wretched enough to wish the dream a reality ;\nthat I was so troubled about Walter that life had become a burden. After\nbreakfast I got my writing material, and called my daughter and told her to\nwrite Walter a letter at once and tell him to come home. To be sure and\nget her letter off by the first mail train. I then rode out to one of my farms\n2 o\n\f510 F. W. H. Myers.\nfor recreation. About 12 m. I received a despatch to the effect that my son\nwas badly hurt and was unconscious. I boarded a freight train and hurried\nat once to the scene, with the understanding that my wife and daughter come\nlater on the passenger. Now, right here comes in a remarkable feature in\nthat strange matter. Through some misunderstanding they failed to catch\nthe train and had to get private conveyance and come directly across the\ncountry. By their changing horses at each little town, they were enabled to\nreach my son by 11 o'clock at night. The accident had happened near the\nresidence of a most excellent farmer, whose daughter my son had been long\nvisiting. To the house of this gentleman he was taken, as it was not only\nnear by, but was the house of his best friends. He had a large family of\nchildren who were all deeply attached to my son. Of a truth, I could not\nsay that we suffered more than did those people because of my son's death.\nWhen my wife entered the room where our boy lay unconscious, this girl I\nspeak of was standing at the head of his bed weeping. She gave a glance\naround, and then whispered in my ear, '' This is my dream ! This is the\nroom I saw you in\u2014these are the people I dreamed of.\" Even her trip there\nin a wagon was a verification of her dream, and the family were just such\npeople as she described to me\u2014\" very plain, but most excellent country\npeople.\" The very nature of the country through which she travelled was\nin perfect fulfilment of her dream, as was also the scenery surrounding the\nhouse.\nIn conclusion I will say that the heaviness of feeling that so oppressed\nme has all disappeared. I have never felt that peculiar, that indescribable\nweight that was crushing out my very life, since Sunday morning, the 17th\nof December. Of course, I feel sad because of my loss, but it is altogether\na different feeling. rp j. Ivey\nMrs. Ivey adds the following corroboration :\u2014\nFebruary l\u00b1th, 1894.\nProf. James,\u2014It was after daylight on the morning of 17th December,\n1893, that I had the dream. I thought that I was at a strange place. I had\ngone there in a wagon. I had no recollection of my husband going with me,\nbut he was there and seemed to be a particular friend of tho family. It was\na large family, and I was very much struck with their manner and dress and\ngeneral appearance. I observed the house closely and the scantiness of its\nfurniture and the slip-shod way it seemed to be kept. The children were\ngetting lessons, and would go to my husband for assistance. The largest one\nof the children, a girl about budding into womanhood, sat on my husband's\nlap and was very affectionate. I was not the least jealous of this girl, only I\nwondered how in the world came my husband so intimate with those people\nwhom I had never seen or even heard of before. They did not seem to pay\nany attention to me, but to devote themselves entirely to my husband, who\nseemed to be the centre of attraction. Suddenly my husband dropped over\nand died,\u2014and then I seemed to be at home, and awoke.\nAbout 12 m. the same day, we got a telegram from Copeville, Tex., that\nour son was fatally injured, and to come at once. My husband went immedi\nately on a freight train. Through some misunderstanding I had to go in a\nprivate conveyance across the country. As soon as I entered the house I\nthought of my dream, for it was all just as I had dreamt, even the house\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 511\nand its surroundings. The peculiar dress and manner of the people, their\nscantiness of furniture and negligent housekeeping, even to the children\ngetting their lessons, and the larger girl who wept over our son like her\nheart would break\u2014all were just as I had dreamed that very morning No\none could have told that the dead boy was not their son instead of ours.\nWe learned that he was indeed an intimate and most particular friend of the\nfamily ; that he spent more of his time there than anywhere else, that all\nthe children looked on him as a brother, and that the larger girl loved him\nmore than a brother. With the single exception of putting my husband in\n; place of my son, the dream was a real and vivid anticipation of the actual.\nA. L. Ivey.\n[Even this great inaccuracy\u2014the substitution of the husband for\nthe son\u2014does not, I think, destroy the impression of a true relation\nbetween the actual and the visionary scene.]\nIn a subsequent letter Mr. Ivey gives some further particulars :\u2014\nForney, Texas, April 20th, 1895.\nMr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir, \u2014Replying to yours of the 12th\ninst. I will say :\u2014\n1st. My son was hurt about 11.30 a.m. Sunday, December 17th, 1893.\n2nd. I woke about 3 a.m. the same morning, but not being able to go\nback to sleep from some undefinable cause, I got up about 4 o'clock and\n' kindled a fire and remained up.\n3rd. He was returning from church with two otheryoung men in a buggy\nwhen the horses took fright and, running away, came in contact with a tree\nwhich, striking my son, produced the fatal injuries from which he died.\n4th. The blow produced concussion of the brain, from which he was\nunconscious the greater part of the time. He died about la.m., Tuesday\n19th.\nAfter more than a year I know of nothing 1 can add to the letter I wrote\nProf. James. I believe it contained as near the truth as it was possible for\nme to write. As near as I can remember, for six weeks or more before the\naccident I was to a great extent two different distinct persons. During the\nday, I was my normal self\u2014satisfied\u2014interested in my business and going\nalong as usual. But at night I was altogether another person. I would\ngenerally take a short nap and then awake with the most awful feeling of\nweight and depression that it ia possible to conceive of. I could seldom sleep\nall night, (though I am usually a sound sleeper), I would lie and toss vainly\ntrying to sleep\u2014feeling all the time that there was nothing more to live for\n\u2014that all that was worth living for had gone out of my life\u2014that I had lived\ntoo long\u2014and that my life was nothing henceforth but a burden. When I\nwould awake after a short nap, \u00a3 felt like I imagine a person must feel who\nwas to have been hanged that day and realised the dreadful fact immediately\nafter awakening. This expresses it better than anything I can think of. I\nonce called the attention of a friend to my singular condition\u2014it was\nsomething unusual in my life\u2014I couldn't understand it\u2014I remarked to him\nthat I was so low-spirited as soon as I went to bed that I could not rest, and\nthat I could see no sense in, it as my business was in good condition. I\n2 o 2\n\f512 F. W. H. Myers.\nthought possibly that I was going to be sick, as I was only troubled at night\nand was as cheerful and full of life during the day as I usually am. I don't\nknow, for some time, that this state of mind was in any way associated with\nmy son, but gradually he became the centre, as it were, around which the\nawfulness seemed to crystallise. On Sunday morning, December 17th, I\nawoke about 3 o'clock and the feeling was so heavy that I could not stand it\nand got up and made me a fire. As soon as breakfast was over I got pen and\npaper and ordered my daughter to write to Walter to come home at once.\nI remember well walking the floor after breakfast ; and, turning to a friend\nwho was at my house, I remarked to him, \" Jo, I am troubled to death about\nWalter\u2014I see ahead of him\u2014and there is ruin.\" I then called my daughter\nand, getting material and placing it on the table before her, ordered her to\nwrite to Walter then to come home at once.\nUnderstand though, I never dreamed of any accident happening to him\nthat day\u2014I never thought of his getting hurt, or I would have telegraphed\nto him. I was simply troubled to death about him and couldn't tell why. It\nnever once crossed my mind that he was in any danger at all. 1 had no\npremonition of any evil happening to him. 1 was simply troubled to death\nand he seemed to be the centre of it. I am a farmer. Buckle says that\nfarmers and sailors are the most superstitious of people. Possibly this may\nbe true, buc I don't think I am the least so. I never had anything in the\nway of a premonition in my life before, though I once had a remarkable\nexperience in connection with my first child who died at nine years of age ;\nstill it was in no sense a premonition. In the whole range of human experi\nence I know of no class of phenomena so inexplicable as premonitions.\nEven if Spiritualism be true, I cannot see how spirit intercourse can explain it.\nT. F. Ivity.\nThis case seems to tell against the view that the father's trans\ncendental foresight discerned the accident long beforehand. It\nsuggests rather that some intelligence to which the impending accident\nwas long previously known may have endeavoured to inform the father,\nbut only when the accident was just about to occur was able to\nimpress the father still more strongly, and also to inform the mother\nof the event, though with much symbolic confusion.\nCan we suppose that the boy's own spirit was thus aware before\nhand of his own impending death, and was able to transmit the\nknowledge to the father, although not to the boy's own supraliminal\nconsciousness,\u2014with the desire, perhaps, that the father should avert\nthe accident by summoning the boy home 1 Far-fetched though this\nsounds, we have a few cases of so-called \" banshees \" where the fact\nthat all the family except the dying man himself are roused by the\nalarming sounds, looks as though those premonitory sounds were some\nhow caused by the spirit which is about to quit the flesh (see Proceedings,\nVol. V., p. 307). But the evidence for \"banshees\" and \"doubles\"\nis too scanty to justify insistence on this view, and we shall presently\nfind that the agency of disembodied spirits is more often suggested.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 513\nI must first, however, quote a few more cases where the origin of\nthe precognitive vision remains quite obscure. I will begin with a\ntrivial incident, where possibly a full telepathic knowledge of the minds\nof others might have led to an expectation of the meeting which\nactually occurred. This resembles an extreme instance of the \" home\ncoming \" cases, where a man returning to his house is seen before he\nactually arrives.\nI P. CI. 129.\nFrom Captain Parker, through the Rev. A. T. Fryer.\nHythe Vicarage, Southampton, April 16th, 1889.\nDear Mr. Fryer,\u2014On referring to the only notes I have, I find I cannot\nfix the exact date of the occurrence of which you want particulars. It was,\nhowever, during the latter half of June, 1886, as I find it was then that the\nman arrived whose coming I dreamt about.\nI was then in charge of a Division of Coastguard, and it was a part of my\nduties to visit the various coastguard stations within the limits of that\ndivision of the coast. The dream, as nearly as I can remember it, was as\nfollows : that I was visiting an outlying station where there were several\ncoasting vessels moored, their heads out seaward, and sterns secured to the\nshore with hawsers. Two navy bluejackets landed from one of the craft,\n, quite -to my surprise, and on asking where they were from, one of them said\nhe had been sent from Wick for duty at Sandhaven (a village in my division).\nThe details of the dream were so vividly impressed on my mind on\nwaking, which is quite unusual with me, that I told my housekeeper about\nit at or about breakfast time\u2014as far as I know the only time I ever told her\nany dream at all- and for the time thought no more of it, but soon after, I\nthink the same day, when the post came I received an official letter appoint\ning a man from Wick for duty at Sandhaven.\nI was so astonished at this coincidence that I at once said to my house\nkeeper :\n\" You remember the dream I told you about a man coming from Wick for\nSandhaven. Here is his official appointment.\"\nA further curious coincidence in connection with the above is that in the\nordinary course of events this man would have proceeded from Wick to\nAberdeen by steamer, and from thence north by rail, and in fact that was\nhow he was ordered to go ; but on this occasion, which sometimes happened,\nthe steamer stopped off Fraserburgh and landed the man there without my\nknowledge at the time, until I found a strange bluejacket at my quarters,\nand on asking who it was and where he had come from, he told me he had\nlanded from the steamer from Wick, and was sent for duty at Sandhaven.\nAt that moment all the details of the dream again came to my mind, and the\nfact of the man landing on the coast instead of coming by rail was also in\naccordance with the details of the dream. It is hardly necessary for me to\nremark that nothing occurred beforehand that would lead me to expect a man\nbeing sent from Wick, or I should not have thought that the dream was\ncurious or worth a moment's thought.\n\f514 F. W. H. Myers.\nI have no doubt my housekeeper remembers something of this occurrence,\nas she has a better memory than I have for most things. I have not written\nto her on the subject, as I thought you might prefer to have her evidence\nwithout any reminder from me to her about it. Y F H Parker.\nThe following is from Captain Parker's housekeeper. If her recollection\nis exact, there was more coincidence in the man's aspect than Captain Parker\nhas described.\nFraserburgh, April 18th, 1889.\nIn answer to your inquiry about Captain Parker's dream, I remember him\ntelling me about it. He said that in his dream he left the house, and soon\nafter met the coastguard man, and asked him if he was the man that was\ncome to Sandhaven station from Wick, and he said, \"I am.\" Mr. Parker\nsaid, when telling me about it next morning, '' How I wish to see that man. \"\nHe saw him soon, to his astonishment, the exact image and likeness as in his\ndream. Elizareth Macdonald.\nHere is a \" home-coming \" case, interesting as being collective,\nalthough, as in many out-of-door cases, the hypothesis of mistaken\nidentity seems a possible one.\nP. 167. Coon Rapids,\nApril 2Uh, 1892.\nMr. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir, \u2014One Sunday in the latter part of March, my\nson went down street to practice a cornet solo with a lady pianist. After he\nhad been gone a short time, I got up from my seat and went to the window,\nand looked in the direction he had gone. I was not thinking of his coming for\nsome time, yet I saw him as plainly as I ever did, coming at a little distance.\nI said to the family, \"Here comes the Professor.\" My daughter-in-law\nleaned back in her chair to look out of the window. She said, \" Yes, there\nhe comes.\" We looked at him a few seconds, and turned from the window.\nWhat seems queer is we failed to notice his not coming in, or to say anything\nabout it. I don't remember thinking of him again until he really came some\ntime afterwards. As usual I thought very little about it until next day. I\nthen enquired of him, and he assured me he went directly where he started\nto go, and remained there an hour and a half, when he came directly home.\nI told him I saw his ghost. He laughed, as they always do. The third day\nafterwards I chanced to look out and saw him (not his ghost) coming in the\nvery same place. This was a very windy day. Now, here is something\nstrange about it, if I can explain it as it appeared.\nThe Sunday that I saw his ghost was a calm day, but he appeared as\nthough the wind was blowing his clothes all to one side, and his head was\ndrawn down inside his coat collar, as if to protect it from the wind. [He]\nhad the appearance of being out in a strong wind, just as he really was the\nthird day after. He seemed to be walking fast, and yet did not advance a\nstep. After thinking it over for days, I bethought me to ask my daughter-\nin-law how he appeared to her. She described him exactly as I saw him,\nand the same strong wind and bending his head.\nM. E. Vradenburg.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 515\nMr. Hodgson,\u2014I saw the apparition my mother-in-law has told you of\njust as she describes it.\nDelia Vradenburg.\nReceived March 19th, 1894 :\u2014\nMy brother went out to practise on the cornet with a pianist, as mother\nhas stated, and when he had been gone a short time, mother went to the\nwindow and says, \"Here comes the Professor ! \" My wife also looked out\nand saw him, as she testified in mother's statement. We all talked about his\nreturning so soon, but did not notice his failing to come in then. But when\n; he returned, he declared he was not out at that time, but had come directly\nhome after practice. Remember my wife and mother seeing him on the\nthird day after, really coming in the same place, and appearing as they saw\nhim first, the wind blowing his clothes the same way.\nE. H. Vradenburg.\nThe next case is a remote one, but it involves incidents not likely\nto have been forgotten. Unfortunately, no corroboration is now\nobtainable.\nP. 145. Dream.\nThe percipient, Miss K. M. Cleary, writes :\u2014\nAlbert-road, Carrickfergus, Co. Antrim.\nt February 15th, 1892.\nI will first state that I am a very healthy woman, and have been so all\nmy life. I am not in the least nervous. My occupation is that of head\nteacher in one of the Board's Model Schools.\n[After giving an account of an occasion when she saw an apparition of one\nof her assistants, who was absent at the time, and another occasion when\nshe saw the apparition of an unknown person, Miss Cleary says :\u2014]\nWhen I was about fifteen and at a convent boarding school, I dreamt,\nwithout any cause that could inspire it, that my father was ill, of details\nconnected with it, of his death, of results which followed. When the bell\nrang for getting up, and the nun came round to wake us, I, who had been\nroused from my painful chain of visions, was sitting in my nightdress on the\nside of the bed, and so faint-looking that the lady insisted I should return to\nbed. But this 1 would not do. I was too terrified, and yet so glad it was\n\" only a dream.\" This was Friday. On Sunday morning came the bad\nnews : \"Kate, \u2014Father is very ill ; pray for him.\" And so commenced the\nchain of sad realities pictured so graphically to me.\nIn answer to our inquiries, Miss Cleary wrote.further : \u2014\nFebruary 26th, 1892.\nIn reference to the dream previous to my father's death, you ask me if I\ncan give further details, dates, and corroboration, and \" did it happen at the\nbeginning of his illness, or before, or after it ? \"\nWell, I think the only important detail I did not mention, or, at least,\nlay stress on, is that it was the sound of the bell for rising which broke the\nchain of pictures that were being presented to me\u2014that I was sent for to go\n\f516 F. W. H. Myers.\nhome (we lived in Roscrea, Co. Tipp. , where the convent is) ; that I did go\nhome ; that I turned to go to the bedroom that had always been occupied by\nhim ; that mother, close behind me, motioned me to an opposite room, which\nhad never been used as a bedroom ; that I went in, saw the bed in a certain\nposition, head towards this wall, foot that ; that Dr. R. was towards the foot\nof the bed, holding in his hand a white china tea-cup, with lilac flower\npattern, one of a set we had ; that on the window was a very peculiar new\nstyle of lace curtain, the pattern of which I had never seen anywhere. I\ndreamt he died, and of the grief and terrible trouble ; and about this part\nthere was, as it were, a cloud, and one distinct figure loomed from it\u2014that of\nan uncle, father's brother, Dr. James Cleary, of Dublin, (27, N. Earl-street),\ndeceased since. I saw, or felt, that James took my only brother back with\nhim to Dublin.\nEvery detail of the dream was verified. Now, with me, this dream is\nunique in, if I may express myself so, its span.\nThe loud, rapid tones of the hand-bell rung in the dormitory roused me,\nand mechanically 1 sprang from bed, scarcely awake ; in a daze or stupor 1\nwas sitting on the side of it. The nun whose duty it was to go from bed to\nbed to make sure we had all arisen, found me as I described, noted my\nappearance, shook me a little, told me I seemed very ill, and should lie down\nagain. This aroused me quite. I would not have gone back to that bed\njust then for worlds. 1 told her I was not ill, that I had been dreaming, and\ndreamt that my father was dead ; but she \" would not listen to such\nnonsense, superstition, and folly, &c.\" (She is dead, and there is no one\nwho can corroborate.) I may have mentioned it to a companion ; I did not\nattempt to do so again to any of the nuns.\nAt the time 1 had this dream I had every reason to believe that my father\nwas in perfect health ; and he urns in perfect health. He was medical doctor\nto the house. I had seen him a few days before from a window, walking in\nthe grounds with the Mother or Superioress. He looked then, as he always\ndid, the embodiment of health and good humour. In comparing dates and\nevents afterwards with my mother, who, unhappily, is no more, I found that\nthe dream occurred on the eve of his first day's indisposition. He was\nattending a fever patient some miles from the town, got a severe wetting,\nwhich predisposed him to the infection, which he caught. He was but 5\ndays ill. He died on the 19th July, 1853. I am now 52, therefore I was not\nso much as 15 when he died. His death changed the whole course of my\nlife, or rather, shunted me quite on other lines.\nOn Wednesday morning 1 had the dream. On the same Wednesday he\ngot the wetting. Wednesday night he felt nervous and unwell, and had a\nhot foot-bath before going to bed. Thursday, I presume he did not go out.\nI'm sure he lay for the firsftime on Friday. Friday evening I first had any\nintimation of his illness. Then, my aunt, his sister, who was a nun there\nand one of my class mistresses, told me that mother had sent word of it,\nwith a request that the nuns would pray for him, but she added : \" There is\nno cause for alarm.\" I recollect nothing particular about Saturday.\nOn Sunday morning I was called away from the breakfast table and told\nI was to dress for going home, to see my father, who had become worse. I\nwent and found as I had seen in my dream.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 517\nMother told me afterwards that she was greatly shocked by my standing\nas I did at the threshold of the door, and that t seemed not to be able to\nkeep my eyes from the windows. The room and everything in the room was\nas I had seen them in my dream.\nI know that father had been thinking of me particularly during the early\npart of the week in which he took ill, as I had had an earache. He sent me\na drug for it, which cured it at once, but he was not aware of the success of\nhis remedy. He asked me then, durmg this interval of consciousness while\nI made my short visit, how was the pain in the ear ? I said : \" Your little\n, bottle cured it.\" (I had the same little bottle for many years.) He then\nkissed me and put his hand on my head and blessed me. The doctor then\nalmost pulled me away, and told mother to take me from the room.\nI remember well how unnaturally calm I was, and this calm, or apparent\ninsensibility, remained throughout his short illness, and when I heard of his\ndeath. Mother used often to remark how strange it all was, and how\nextraordinary that I, who was the only child absent when he became ill,\nshould be the only one who received his sad farewell, and, as she said, \" It\nwas fitting too, for I was his favourite child.\" j\u00a3. jyj Cleary.\nIt will be observed that the day of the week on which the dream occurred,\nis given differently in the two accounts. Whether Dr. Cleary's illness had\nactually begun or not at the time, it appears that the dream took place\nduring a period when at least there was no reason for special anxiety about\n. him, even on the part of his family at home, and when Miss Cleary herself\nhad no reason for anxiety at all.\nThe case which I next quote, sent to us by Lord Wenlock, was\nomitted by Mrs. Sidgwick on the ground that an accident of this kind\nto a railway official is not rare enough to raise the incident clearly\nabove chance coincidence. While partly agreeing, I think, neverthe\nless that the case, as now further corroborated, is one on which the\nreader should have the opportunity of forming his own opinion.\nP. 368.\nFrom Thomas Carbert, Porter at Escrick Station, through Lord Wenlock,\nEscrick Park, York.\nAt the end of February or beginning of March, 1883, I dreamt I saw\nMr. Thompson, the station-master, lying with his legs cut off, close to a heap\nof coals against a small cabin at the back of the station. I dreamt that the\naccident happened to him by what we call the \"pick-up \" goods train, and\nthat it occurred in the month of May.\nI told my dream to Mr. Thompson the next morning, and, though he\nlaughed over it, it seemed to make him uneasy.\nOn the 18th of May, 1883, Mr. Thompson was run over by the \" pick\nup \" goods train, and both his legs were cut off.\nThe accident happened at the back of the cabin just where I dreamt I\nhad seen him lying.\nI have taken this down from the lips of the above-named Thomas\nCarbert.\u2014Wenlock, February Uth, 1884.\n\f518 F. W. H. Myers.\nFurther enquiry has much improved the evidence in this case. Thomas\nCarbert, who has now been moved to llillington, writes under date October\n7th, 1895 :\u2014\n\" I did dream it, and told Mr. Thompson of it, and he told Mr. Hartas\nFoxton of it the same morning. Mr. Thompson said it was three months to\nMay yet. As to what made me say it would happen in May, something\nseemed to say it would be in May in my dream.\"\nMr. Foxton also writes as follows from The Grange, Escrick, October\n12th, 1895 :\u2014\nDear Sir, \u2014The incident you mention is vividly impressed upon my\nmemory. One morning upon my arrival at Escrick station to catch the\n8 train, Thompson and Carbert were together in the booking-office, and after\nthe customary greeting Thompson said to me, \" Master (he always called me\n'Master'), what do you think Carbert here has been telling me? He had a\ndream last night, and that I have only so long to live \" (mentioning the time,\neither two months or three). I replied, \" Why, if you have only that time to\nlive you must make the very best use of it ; at the same time, if you know\nyour days are numbered, you may still have longer to live than some of us.\"\nThis, of course, I said half in jest, and the train coming in the incident\nended. But 1 noticed particularly that Carbert seemed quite downhearted\nand distressed when Thompson was relating the dream to me, and I must\nsay it made some indefinable impression upon me, so much so that when I\nheard of the accident to Thompson, the dream and its ending flashed\nvividly back to me.\nYou are at liberty to make use of this letter in any way you choose,either\npublicly or privately. Hartas Foxton.\nFor a reason similar to Mrs. Sidgwick's,\u2014namely, the frequency\nof accidents in a miner's life,\u2014I have omitted several premonitions\nof such events ;\u2014premonitions pointing mainly to individual deaths,\nbut sometimes taking the form of some strange sight or sound, \u2014an\naridusfragor in the heart of the earth,\u2014which is held to intimate\nwide-spread disaster to the mine itself. A layman cannot judge as to\nhow far the very conditions which make the danger may also cause the\nunusual sound. The following case, however, does not seem open to\nthese general objections, since the danger was one voluntarily incurred\nby a man above ground.\nP. 124. The Pit Explosion at Tredegar.\nFrom Tfte South Wales DaUy News,\nNovember 11th, 1884.\nA curious circumstance was narrated, and its accuracy vouched for, on\nMonday, at Tredegar, in connection with the death of the man Pugh. He,\nit will be remembered, persisted, in spite of the remonstrances of the police,\nin pressing forwards to the mouth of the pit, offering to give his assistance,\nwhich, as he was under the influence of liquor, was refused. He, however,\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 519\nwent too close to the edge, fell down the shaft, and was dashed to atoms.\nHe, it seems, was on intimate terms with a brewer at the Cambrian Inn,\nnamed Phillip Williams. Phillip Williams had a dream on Saturday night\nthat he saw Pugh approach a coal pit, into which he fell and was killed.\nPugh was drinking at the Cambrian on Saturday, and then Williams told\nhim his dream. When the explosion was known at Tredegar he again saw\nPugh, and warned him not to go near the pit, but Pugh started off direct to\nthe scene of the calamity. His death took place shortly afterwards.\nFrom Mr. Phillip Williams to Mr. C. Downing.\nCambrian Inn, Tredegar, December 29th, 1884.\nThe unfortunate man Phillip Pugh, who met his sad end by falling down\nPochins Pit, I knew very well for years. And on Friday night, prior to the\nexplosion, which occurred between 9 and 10 o'clock on Saturday night [the\ntime is correct, F. P.], I dreamt that I saw Pugh going towards the pit, and\nfalling down, and I was struggling with him to prevent him falling down,\nbut could not prevent him ; I was in great trouble, and when I awoke 1 was\nin a bath of perspiration. On the following evening between six and seven\no'clock, I met Pugh and told these words.\n'' 1 have been in awful trouble about you last night. I dreamt that I saw\nyou going towards the pit and falling down and I was doing all in my power\nto prevent you, but could not. I hope to God nothing will happen to you ;\nbe careful, it may be a warning, as you are working in a very dangerous place. \"\n'The answer he gave me : \" Oh, Williams,\" with a smile, \"there's nothing\ngoing to happen to me ; don't I look well ? \" and directly he heard of the\nexplosion he ran down towards the pit, which is three and a-half miles from\nTredegar, and when he came to the pit's mouth he wanted to give his assist\nance and was pushed back several times by the authorities, but would still\ncome forward, and said that he would be the first man that would go down\nthe pit ; and it so happened. I may tell you that he worked in the pit and\nwas a very plucky young man. I told it to several people before it happened\nand have got two names and addresses below, which I can vouch for their\nrespectability.

Upper Melbourne, Quebec,\nDecember 14th, 1891.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Sir,\u2014Yours of December 11th received, and I\nbeg to hand you the premonition referred to in my former letter. I have\nmade it as short and concise as possible. Newiands Coburn.\nA Peculiar Dream or Premonition.\nIn the year 1875, I think, one night I dreamed that my wife had gone to\na friend's, who lived just across the river St. Francis (which here is about-\n750 feet wide) at 11 o'clock a.m., and was going to stay for dinner. But on,)\ngetting there, she having walked down the river and across the public bridge,\nand up again to her friend's, she found the house open, but nobody at home.\nSo she went down to the river bank, and called to me from the other side to\nswim across to her and bring some refreshment in a tin can, which I\nimmediately undertook to do ; but just as I was nearing a gravel bar in the\nmiddle of the river, but while just on the deepest place, the can, which was\nin my left luind, would continually keep drawing me under, and I would keep\nswallowing some water. So I was obliged to strike back for the home shore,\nwhich I reached in safety, amid great anxiety of my wife, who was watching\nme from the shore. The dream was so vivid that it woke me, and my\nstomach was sore from the supposed swallowing and belching out again of\nthe water.\nI turned over and went to sleep, but in the morning I still felt the effect\nof the dream on the muscles of the stomach, and I told my vrife then and 1\nthere of it, and how my stomach felt. And after breakfast I went to\nbusiness, and was just telling a customer whom I was serving of the peculiar\ndream, when a neighbour rushed into the store and said he was afraid that\nthere was trouble down at the river, as a boy on the other side (just where\nmy wife was in the dream), was running up and down, yelling and\ngesticulating, and another naked one on this side was crying and calling\nfor help.\nIt was just 11 a.m. I started at once for the river, throwing off my coat\nand vest as I ran, secured a boat and a young man to help me run it out,\nand after the boy pointed out where a companion had sunk for the last time,\na few minutes before, I dived down in 12 to 15 feet of water just off the\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 521\ngravel bar, and grasped the arm of the drowned young man with my left\nband, and brought him to the surface, only to find that my companion had\nallowed the boat I had dived off to drift quite a distance from me. I then\nhad the same struggle to get the body and myself to another boat that had\njust put out from shore that I had in my dream, swallowing and then\nbelching out a lot of water ; and nothing but the encouraging shouts from\nthose on shore, who had hastily gathered (my wife among them) nerved me\nto the struggle. I then in reality suffered the same pain which I felt in my\ndream, and the spot where the young man was drowned was just where the\n\"can\" troubled me in my dream, and where I turned.\nN. Coburn.\nUpper Melbourne, Quebec, September 4th, 1893.\nRichard Hodgson, LL.D.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014. . . My wife, to whom I\nrelated my dream before the drowning took place, died a few months after\nI wrote you.\nYou will pardon me, if I give you my explanation of the dream and\ndrowning. I should have said that the young man had just come to visit\nfriends on the opposite side of the river, and you will notice my rough\ndiagram herewith, that the R.R. station of the G.T.R. is below where I\nlive, and the young man arrived about 1.30 a.m. (say midnight) and was\nobliged to walk back up the river on the opposite side from where I lived,\nand I feel sure that the time of my dream was when he was passing up (say\n? a.m.) on the opposite side of the river. He went to bed at his friend's and\ndid not get up until late, and immediately went to the river with some other\nyoung men for a bath and swim.

Through Mrs. Baker (wife of Lieut. Col. F. Baker Pasha, V.C.).\nJune 22nd, 1891.\nA rather strange thing appeared in our family some years since, in\n1887. One day my sister left the room in which she and I had been sitting\nand went into the drawing room. I immediately heard her call out, and on\ngoing to see what was the matter, found her very much frightened, at having,\nas she said, seen a coffin in front of the piano. Three weeks afterwards\nanother sister of ours died, and previous to the funeral the coffin was brought\ndown and placed before the piano, in exactly the spot on which it had been\nseen by the sister who had the prevision of it.

The Post-Dispatch, 513, Olive Street, St. Louis,\nFebruary 24th, 1891.\nMr. Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I called on Mrs. Sara Weiss, of 3,710a,\nOlive Street, yesterday afternoon. She was suffering with laryngitis and \\\ncatarrh, and was unable to speak except in a whisper, and said that her\ndelay in writing out an account of her dream was due to her sickness. She\ntold me of the dream, as also of several other seemingly remarkable experi\nences, and promised me that she would write an account of them as soon as\nshe improved a little. I am to call on her again for the report in a week or\nten days, and if I find that the report is not yet written, I shall write it my\nself and give it to her to sign. She appears to me to be sincere, and if her\nstory can be corroborated by several other persons, as she says it can be,\nthe case will, I think, be a very good one for your collection of \" occult\nwonders.\"\nMrs. W. dreamed on Friday night, January 21st, 1883, that her daughter,\nMrs. ChaunceyH.C.,had been confined and that she had acted as accoucheuse,\nthe doctor whom they expected not having arrived. After the birth of the\nchild, a doctor arrived, but not their regular family doctor. He was a youngj\ncountry-looking fellow with black eyes and hair, and wearing grey pants,\nblack vest and coat, and a blue satin necktie with a peculiar coral figure in\nit. This was the dream in outline, and she told it with many details at\nbreakfast next morning to her daughter and son-in-law. Four days after,\nTuesday, January 25th, the child was born just as she had dreamed it had\nbeen, even to all particulars, and after it was all over, her son-in-law brought\nin a young doctor exactly resembling the man she had seen in her dream,\nface, dress, and everything. But at first she didn't think of the dream, and\nreally thought she had seen him in real life before. She claims that she\nnever once thought of the dream until the child had been born and the doctor\nhad been there some time. None of the family had ever seen this doctor\nuntil that day, and Mr. C. had tried to get five other doctors before he called\nat this doctor's office. When Mr. C. went down town Saturday morning,\nJanuary 22nd, he told his friend, H. B., about it, and the latter told his\nwife and W. B., and a Miss Slaughter called on Mrs. Weiss that afternoon\nand they all talked about it. All of these people are still living except Miss\nSlaughter. The B.'s live in New York City, and the C.'s in Chicago. Mr.\nB. is manager and vice-president of the United States Express Company,\nwith headquarters at Chicago. In January, 1881, he was private secretary\nto Albert Fink, president of the Railroad Freight Pool, and lives in N.Y.\nCity. Mrs. Weiss was living then, as now, in St. Louis, but was visiting her\ndaughter in N.Y. Mrs. Weiss tells me that Mr. B. objects to the use of his\nname in connection with the matter, as it would be embarrassing to him in\nhis business, but I think he might be prevailed upon to answer a few ques\ntions, if assured that his name would not be published. His wife will let her\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 523\nname be used if the committee want it, Mrs. Weiss says. The B.'s have not\nbeen heard from yet. Mrs. W. told me Mr. B.'s business, but I don't recall\nit just now. Mrs. W. talks like, and has every appearance of being a well-\nbred lady, and used good language in her conversation. I was favourably\nimpressed.\nW. A. Kelsoe, 1,331, South 13th Street.\n1,331, South 13th Street, St. Louis, March 16th, 1891.\nMr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014Mrs. Sara Weiss handed me a\nwritten statement of that dream a few days ago with her name and address\nattached, and I have had a type-written copy of it made for you, which I here\nwith send you. I am at liberty to send you the original or a copy, and send\nthe [latter] because it is more easily read. I see that Mrs. W. omitted to\ngive the date of the dream, and I have supplied the omission from memory,\nthough I am not positive whether the month was January or February. Mrs.\nW. asks that the names of the C. 's and B.'s be not used in any publication\nuntil their consent has been obtained, so please use only initial letters. She\nmakes no objection to that. She is also anxious for you to obtain their state\nments regarding her dream, but hardly knows the best way to go about it.\nI suggested to her that perhaps if you sent Mr. C. and Mr. B. a copy of\nsome report of the P.R. Society you could get them interested in the subject\nin that way and then secure their statements afterwards, and she thought\nthat might be done. It may be that Mr. B. would offer no objection at the\noutset.\nMrs. W. omitted to say in her report that the nurse was now living here\nin St. Louis, and could not corroborate the dream. She remembers hearing\nMrs. \\V. and her daughter speak of the dream at the time of the birth of the\nchild, or rather when the young doctor was there immediately afterwards,\nand of hearing them say that the affair came off just as Mrs. W. had dreamed\nit would, but she doesn't remember having heard any of the family speak of\nthe dream prior to the child's birth. I will try and see this nurse and get her\nstatement, as I think it will be of some value, particularly if you fail to\nobtain any corroborative statements from the B.'s or C.'s. Her name is\nMary something, but I don't know her address.\nAccount of Mrs. Sara Weiss.\nThe dream I have promised to relate is remarkable, inasmuch as it ante\ndated the fulfilment of it nearly four days.\nIn October, of 1881, I left my home in St. Louis, going to New York\nCity, to be with my daughter, Mrs. C. H. C, during her expected accouche\nment. Dr. Ranney, an old well-known M.D., was the family physician. His\noffice, as well as that of Mr. C, was far down town, while the family resided\non cor. 124th Street, and Lexington Avenue. It was arranged with Dr.\nRanney that he should come at once when called. The nurse was engaged,\nand everything put in order, so that there might be no delay or confusion.\nI think that on Saturday, the 22nd of the month of January following, a\nheavy storm of snow and sleet prevailed over the region of N.Y. so that tele\ngraph lines were weighted down with sleet and broken to such an extent in\nN.Y. City that for a time there was a break in the service.\n\f524 F. W. H. Myers.\nOn Friday night I dreamed that my daughter's labour came on, that,\nowing to some cause not clearly defined, we failed to get word to Mr. C. ,\nwho was to bring the doctor ; that we sent for the nurse, who came ; that as\nthe hours passed, and neither Mr. C. or the doctor came, we both grew\nfrightened ; that at last I heard Mr. C. on the stairs and cried to him, \" Oh,\nChan, for heaven's sake get a doctor, Ada may be confined at any moment ; \"\nthat he rushed away, and I returned to the bedside of my daughter, who was\nin agony of mind and body ; that suddenly I seemed to know what to do,\nthat I delivered her, attended to her and the child, and that shortly after\nwards Mr. C. came, bringing a tall young doctor, having brown eyes, dark\nhair, ruddy, brunette complexion, and dressed in black coat, grey trousers\nand grey vest, and wearing a bright blue cravat picked out with coral sprigs.\nThe cravat attracted my attention particularly. The young doctor pro\nnounced Mrs. C. properly attended to and left. Then, after awhile, Dr.\nRauney came, saying that he had been away and could not get back, but that\neverything relating to Mrs. C. was all right.\nIn the morning at breakfast, I related my dream to Mr. C. and my\ndaughter, but none of us attached any importance to it. But as the days\npassed, the dream forced itself upon me so persistently that on Monday I said\nto Mr. C. : \"I wish you could arrange some way for us to get word to you\nquickly, for with the telegraph lines down, what can we do in case Ada should\nbe taken sick and you away ?\" Mr. C. smiled and said : \"I guess you are\nworried over that dream, but to satisfy you, I will write a telegram, and leave\nit with instructions at the district office. If the lines are not in order, they\nwill send a boy to me.\"\nI have forgotten to say that Mr. C. on Saturday told a friend, Mr. H. B.,\nof my dream, that in the evening Mr. B. called, and jestingly spoke of the\ndream ; that on the afternoon of Saturday Mrs. B. and a Miss Evans called\nand my daughter related the dream to them. On Tuesday between 9 and 10\no'clock my daughter was taken with labour. Immediately that we knew her\ncondition, I sent the maid with the telegram to the district office, and for\nthe nurse, who arrived a half hour or so before the child was born. As time\npassed and it became apparent that the services of an accoucheur might be\nneeded at any moment, both my daughter and I were greatly frightened, for\nI had no knowledge whatever of how to proceed, as in my dream, so I ran to\nthe window to see if Mr. C. and the doctor might be in sight, then back to\nmy daughter. At last I heard Mr. C. on the stairs, and cried to him to\nbring some doctor quickly, as Ada was on the point of being confined. Mr.\nC. rushed off and I returned to my daughter. She looked at me in terror,\nand said, \"Oh what shall we do ? \" Then came what I shall be glad to have\nexplained. In a moment all sense of claim left me, and all sense of sympathy\nbeyond what a very cool and experienced doctor might feel. I heard myself\nsaying in a peremptory fashion, \" Ada, don't be afraid, I know just what to\ndo, all will go well.\" She looked at me in a surprised way and replied : \"If\nyou are not afraid, I won't be.\" The nurse was panic-stricken, and ran from\nthe room. I went after her and in a manner foreign to me, directed her how\nto assist me\u2014I do not deem it proper or necessary to go into details. Suffice\nit to say that I succeeded perfectly, although there were complications which\nmight have resulted seriously. Mr. C. went to seven doctors' offices before\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 525\nhe found one, when at last he came, bringing a young doctor. The nurse\nwas dressing the baby. My daughter was resting quietly and I sat in a\ncorner of the room, feeling a dazed sensation and wondering if I were going\nto faint. In a few minutes I recovered myself and walked to my daughter's\nbedside, where the young M.D. was making an examination to see if all was\nright. When he turned around, Mr. C. introduced us (T think his name was\nWhite). I was surprised to find that the gentleman had a very familiar look,\nand I said, \" Why, doctor, we have met before, but I do not recall where.\"\nHe smiled and asked, \" Do you reside in N. Y. ? \" \" No, I live in St. Louis ;\nhave you ever been there 1\" \" Yes, about two months ago I passed through\nSt. Louis.\" \"And I,\" I said, \"have been in New York for over three\nmonths, and yet I know I have met you before, but I do not recall where.\"\nAt this moment my daughter plucked at my dress and whispered, \" Look at\nthe doctor's cravat.\" In a moment I knew he was the man whom I saw in\nmy dream, and then realised that all the occurrences of the past six hours\nwere a complete fulfilment of the dream, which only needed Dr. Ranney's\nvisit to finish it. The doctor's dress was exactly as I had seen it in the dream.\nDr. Ranney came in about two hours. He had been called to Brooklyn, and\nthe ice was running so heavily that the boat was delayed. He was very\nmuch surprised to learn that I had acted as accoucheur, and still more so as\nsome complication in the case called for the services of an experienced per\nson. When he came the next day he questioned me closely, and I felt that\nhe doubted my statement. I had had no previous experience, and at my\ndaughter's request, I told him of my dream and that what I considered one\nof the strangest features of the matter was that, on my honour, the dream\nhad not once occurred to me from the beginning of my daughter's labour\nuntil she called my attention to the doctor's cravat.\nDr. Ranney desired me to write an account of the whole matter, and I\npromised to do so, but delayed it, and never did it. I have endeavoured to\nhave my statement of the matter corroborated, but find that Dr. Ranney is\ndead. Miss Evans is also dead. My son-in-law, for reasons which he deems\nsufficient, does not wish his, or my daughter's name used. Mr. and Mrs. B.\nI know but slightly, and do not like to make the request of them, which they\nmight not like to refuse, and then they may have forgotten the matter.\nI am much too earnest a seeker for a solution of the question at the\nbeginning of my statement to allow myself to exaggerate or mistake. I have\ncondensed as much as possible my statement. The full particulars would be\ntoo lengthy. If my information was not from some foreseeing intelligence,\nwhere did it come from ?\nSara Weiss,\nMarch, 1891. 3,710, Olive Street, St. Louis, Mo.\nStudio of A. M.

I have read\nher M.S.S detailing the very peculiar experience in N.Y. ten years ago, and\nit coincides exactly with my recollection of the account she gave of it a\nfew days after the event. No one but Mrs. W. knows that I was informed\n2 p\n\f526 F. W. H.

I was probably the only person, except those mentioned in Mrs.\nW.'s statement, who was informed of the experience at the time.\nI am aware that my statement is merely corrobatory, and of no positive\nvalue as emdetux ; but the whole affair was so far removed from the ordinary\nrun of psychic experiences, that it may be of some interest to you.\nA. M. Blanchard.\nMr. A. M. Blanchard further writes :\u2014\nMr. Richard Hodgson.\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I mailed you yesterday a letter\nrequesting information, and also containing a statement in support of Mrs.\nWeiss's report of her peculiar experience in N.Y. in 1881. This morning I\nmet Mrs. W., and she voluntarily suggested that I make the statement\nwhich I had already forwarded, and gave permission that it go on record if\nso desired. I was in St. Louis at the time of the occurrence, and she wrote\nan account, somewhat less detailed than the one furnished you, but as far\nas my memory serves\u2014and it naturally made a strong impression\u2014agreeing\nwith it in every particular. The letter is not now in existence. Mary, the\nmaid, was not told the dream, but was in the room immediately after the\nbirth of the child, and remembers the remark made to Mrs. Weiss by Mrs.\nC, reminding her of the appearance of the young doctor in the dream.\nA. M.

I talked with Mr. C, but he has been so\nimmersed in business during the years which have elapsed since the time\nwhen the dream occurred, that he declares that he has no recollection of it,\nor of any matters outside of his business, and knowing him as I do, I do\nnot doubt the assertion. My daughter and I have so often recurred to the\nbirth of the little boy, and incidents connected with that event, that she\nremembers the dream distinctly, and I send her attestation of the fact.\nSara Weiss.\n2,916, Pine-st, St. Louis, Mo.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 527\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nI went from St. Louis to New York iu 1881, as nurse maid to Mrs. C.'s\nlittle girl. I lived with Mrs. C. when the little boy was born. I was a\nlittle over fourteen years old when the baby was born. I do not think I was\ntold of Mrs. Weiss's dream, but after the baby was born I was told to bring\nthe little girl into the room. A strange doctor was just leaving. Mrs. C.\nsaid to Mr. C, \" Did you notice the doctor's neck-tie ?\" Mr. C. said \" No.\"\nThen Mrs. C. said, \" Why, I know him by mamma's description as the\ndoctor she saw in her dream.\" I heard a good deal of talk about the dream,\n. but I was so young I did not pay enough attention to what was said to\nremember much about it.\nMarie Luenstroth.\nMy next case also is concerned with a birth ; but it suggests certain\npossibilities which are still more perplexing.\nThe writer of the following account- is a lady recommended to me\nby Dr. Li^beault of Nancy as in all ways an excellent informant ;\u2014a\nlady who haa now for many years taken a leading part in an important\nFrench philanthropic enterprise, and whose mind is not given to\nexaggeration or morbid sentiment. I am obliged thus to describe my\ncorrespondent because, for reasons which seem to me adequate, I\ncannot give her name, or go fully into the points in her letters to me\nwhich have led me to regard her as a scrupulously careful witness.\nFrom among many psychical experiences, mainly conforming to our\nusual types, which she has recorded in a pamphlet in my possession, I\nselect the incident which follows.\nP. 178. [Translation from pamphlet printed 1894.]\nIn November, 1877, I was expecting my third child. On the night\nbefore its birth I had a terrible dream.\nI had the feeling that my room was filled by all kinds of mysterious and\nsorrowful influences, and a small being, separating itself from these\nconfused surroundings at the other end of my room, said to me, ' ' I come\nto you that you may love me.\"\nThis being, of the size of a child two or three years old, was human\nonly in its face, from which shone two large dark eyes ; I remarked also the\nexpression of the mouth, which indicated suffering ; as to the rest of the\nbody, it was so painful to look upon, so different from the rounded forms\nand fresh rosiness of childhood, that I woke in anguish, my heart beating\nviolently.\nIn the morning I told my mother of this dream. She regarded it as a\nnightmare caused by my condition at the time ; and we welcomed without\napprehension the arrival of my third little daughter, a fine child of dark\ncomplexion, well formed, and showing every sign of strong health.\nWhen a few weeks had passed, I observed that this child's physiognomy,\nespecially when it was on the point of crying, bore a strong likeness to the\nchild of my dream. It had also the same large dark eyes ; but very gentle\nin expression, and filled, as it grew older, with a deep but indefinable\n2 p 2\n\f528 F. W. H. Myers.\nsadness. I communicated my apprehensions to my sister. [A letter from\nthis lady, herself concerned with philanthropic and literary work, lies\nbefore me, dated April 13th, 1894. She says, \" I affirm the perfect\nexactitude of this narrative. My sister told me her dream, I was witness\nof her apprehensions during the brief existence of her third little daughter,\nand she said to me textually the words mentioned in her narrative, at the\nend of the child's life. \"] We observed the child's development with the\nanxious attention that every mother will understand.\nShe was very easy to rear, without faults of temper, and incredibly\nprecocious in all ways\u2014in her senses, memory, intelligence, and affectionate\nsensibility.\nI brought her up thus to the age of two years and a half. Then she\nwas taken from me by a terrible malady, granular kidney, (la granulie),\nfollowing upon measles, and finally causing meningitis, after causing\nextreme irritation for weeks. The poor child was seriously ill for three\nmonths and a half. During the last week of her painful existence she was\nreduced to a state of extreme emaciation, and showing her sadly to my\nsister, I said to her with absolute truth, \" Alas ! There is the child of my\ndream, exactly as she appeared to me the night before she was born ! \"\nIt will be observed here that the premonition represented neither\na child with normal resemblance to its parents, nor a child suffering\nfrom any disease which heredity or maternal suggestion could have\ncaused, but a child in a condition into which it actually fell some two\nyears later, as the result of zymotic disease.\nThese last cases offer no indication of any message from without.\nRather they suggest the kind of flashing recognition which a man\nmight experience who had seen his own life beforehand, and now\nretraversed it like a hypnotic subject carrying out a \" deferred\nsuggestion.\" I will next give a few cases where a man's future life\nseems to be shown to him as though from some external source of\nknowledge.\nIn the following case of Dr. Li\u00e9beaolt's,\u2014a case which it is hard to\nregard as more than a series of strange coincidences,\u2014it will be\nobserved that Dr. Li^beault is not himself responsible for more than\nthe fact that the young man believed that he was to die in a certain\nyear. This is just the kind of case where the death might have been\nascribed to terror ; but in fact the subject's terrors here are calmed,\nand he then dies of a disease which terror could not have induced.\nP. 190. From Dr. Lidbeault's note-book.\nM. S. de Ch. came to consult me to-day at 4 p.m. (January 7th, 1886) for\na slight nervous ailment. M. de Ch. is much preoccupied by a lawsuit, and\nby the incident which I proceed to recount.\nOn the 26th December, 1879, while walking in Paris, he saw \" Mme-\nLenormand, Necromancer,\" written on a door. Urged by thoughtless\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 52'J\ncuriosity he entered the house, and was shown into a rather dark room.\nMme- Lenormand came to him, and placed him at a table. She went out and\nreturned, and then looking at the palm of one of his hands said, \"You will\nlose your father in a year from this very day. You will soon be a soldier ;\n(he was 19 years old) but not for long. You will marry young, have two\nchildren, and die at 26.\" M. de Ch. confided this astounding prophecy to\nsome of his friends, but did not take it seriously. However, as his father\ndied after a short illness on December 27th, 1880, precisely a year from the\ninterview, he became less incredulous. And when he became a soldier, for\ni seven months only, married, had two children, and was approaching his\ntwenty-sixth birthday, ho became thoroughly alarmed and thought he had\nonly a few days to live. This was why he came to consult mo, hoping I might\nenable him to avoid his fate. For, as the first four events had taken place,\nhe thought that the last would. On this and the following days I tried to\nsend M. de Ch. into profound sleep in order to dissipate the impression that\nhe would die on the 4th February, his birthday. Mme- Lenormand had not\nnamed a date, but he was so agitated that I could not induce even the\nslightest sleep.\nHowever, as it was absolutely necessary to get rid of his conviction, lest\nit should fulfil itself by self-suggestion, I changed my tactics and proposed\nthat he should consult one of my somnambulists, an old man of 70 or so,\nnick-named \"the prophet,\" because he had exactly foretold his own cure of\narticular rheumatism of 4 years' standing, and the cure of his daughter, the\nl cure in the latter case resulting from his suggestion. M. de Ch. accepted\nmy proposal eagerly. When put into rapport with the somnambulist his\nfirst question was, \" When shall I die ? \" The sleeper, suspecting the state\nof the case, replied after a pause, \"You will die . . . you will die in 41\nyears.\" The effect was marvellous ; the young man recovered his spirits,\nand when the 4th February passed he thought himself safe. [Some of those\nwho had heard of the prophecy concluded in consequence that there had been\nnothing in it. ]\nI had forgotten all this, when at the beginning of October I received\nan invitation to the funeral of my unfortunate patient, who had died on\nSeptember 30th, 1886, in his 27th year, as Mrae- Lenormand had foretold.\nTo prevent the supposition that the whole affair was an illusion on my part,\nI keep this letter of invitation, as well as the record made at the time of M.\nde Ch.'s visit to me. I have since learnt that the unfortunate man had been\nunder treatment for biliary calcuti and died of peritonitis caused by an\ninternal rupture. Dr Li\u00a3beai;lt.\nHere, perhaps, as fitly as elsewhere I may introduce four old cases\nwhich should not be ignored ;\u2014cases the worse for their age, of course,\ninasmuch as we cannot question our informants further ; yet narratives\nwhich have not passed from hand to hand, nor bear any trace of\nfrivolous or superstitious origin. They are grave and mainly first-hand\nstatements, and while they are themselves strengthened by our more\nrecent narratives they do also in their turn lend to those new instances\nsome real support.\n\f530 F. W. H. Myers.\nP. 181.\nTranslation of an extract from the M&inoires du Due de St. Simon.\n(A. Sautelet et Cie, Librairies Editeurs, Paris, 1829). Vol. V., p. 120,\net seq. (A.D. 1706). [The Due de Saint Simon is believed to have\nkept a journal with the object of thence compiling his Mhnoires and\nhere, as in many other places, the account suggests that notes were\ntaken at the time, although, of course, this cannot now be positively\nasserted.]\nHere is something which he [the Duke of Orleans] told me in a corner of\nthe salon at Marly, where we were having a tete-h-tete one day, when he had\njust arrived from Paris, and was on the point of setting out for Italy ; some\nthing so marvellous, con6rmed as it was by events which could not then have\nbeen foreseen, that I cannot omit it. He was interested in all arts and\nsciences, and with great powers of mind, had had all his life the weakness\n(so common at the court of Henry II 's children), which Catherine de\nM^dicis had introduced from Italy amongst other habits and customs. He\nhad sought, as far as he was able, to see the devil, without success, according\nto what he has often told me, and to see marvellous things, and read the\nfuture. Mademoiselle de Sery had at her house a little girl of eight or nine,\nwho had been born there and had never left it, and who possessed the\ninnocence and simplicity of her age and upbringing. Amongst otherdealers\nin hidden mysteries, of whom the Duke of Orleans had seen so many in his\nlife, there was one to be met with at his mistress's house, who boasted that\nhe could cause anything one wanted to know to be seen in a glass of water.\nSome one young and innocent was needed to look into it, and this little girl\nwas just suitable. They amused themselves by wishing to know what was\nhappening in far-away places, and the little girl looked and told what she\nsaw accordingly. The fellow said something in a low voice over the glass of\nwater and immediately it was looked into successfully.\nThe frauds to which the Duke of Orleans had so often been exposed\ninduced him to put a test which might be convincing. He told one of his\nmen in a whisper to go immediately to Madame de Nancr^'a, a little distance\noff, to ascertain exactly who was there, what was doing, the position and\nfurnishings of the room, and everything that was going on there, and to\ncome back and tell him in a whisper, without losing a moment or speaking to\nany one. The order was obeyed in a trice without any one having noticed\nwhat it was, and the little girl was in the room all the while. When the\nDuke of Orleans had been instructed by his messenger, he told the little girl\nto see in the glass who was at Madame de Nancr^'s, and what was going on\nthere. Immediately she told them word for word all that the Duke of\nOrleans' messenger had seen. The description of the faces, figures, and\nclothes of the people who were there, their position in the room, the people\nwho were playing at two different tables, those who were looking on, or talk\ning, seated or standing, the placing of the furniture, in fact everything.\nImmediately the Duke of Orleans sent Nancr4 there, who reported that\neverything was as the little girl had said, and as the valet who had first been\nthere had told the Duke in a whisper.\nHe did not speak to me much on these subjects, because I took the liberty\nof shaming him about them. I now took the liberty of rating him soundly\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 531\nabout his account of this incident and of telling him what I thought might\ndeter him from giving credence to these delusions and from amusing himself\nwith them, at a time moreover, when his mind should have been occupied\nwith so many great subjects. \" That is not all,\" he said to me, \" and I have\nonly told you that to prepare you for the remainder,\" and he immediately\nwent on to relate how, encouraged by the accuracy of what the little girl had\nseen in Madame de Nancr^'s apartment, he had wished to see something\nmore important, and what would happen on the king's death ; but without\nseeking the Hate, which could not be seen in the glass. He put the question\nf then to the little girl, who had never heard Versailles spoken of or seen any\none belonging to the court, except himself. She looked and explained to\nthem at length what she saw. She described accurately the king's room at\nVersailles and the furnishings which were actually found there at his death.\nShe depicted him precisely in his bed, and standing near the bed or in the\nroom, a little child with the order held by Madame de Vontadour, at the\nsight of whom she exclaimed, because she had seen her at Mademoiselle de\nSery's house. She made them recognise Madame de Maintenon, the strik\ning figure of Fagon, the Duchess of Orleans, the Princess de Conti ; she\nexclaimed at the Duke of Orleans ; in short she revealed to them whomsoever\nshe saw there, princes, lords, servants, or valets. When she had finished,\nthe Duke of Orleans, surprised that she had not mentioned Monseigneur\n[the Dauphin], the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy, nor the Duke of Berry,\nasked her if she did not see such-and-such figures. She persisted in answer-\ning \" No,\" and repeated those she did see. The Duke of Orleans could not\nunderstand this, and expressed great astonishment at it to me, and sought in\nvain the reason for it. The event explained it. It was then 1706. All four\nwere at that time in full life and health, and all four died before the king. It\nwas the same with the Prince, the Duke, and the Prince de Conti, whom she\ndid not see, whilst she saw the children of the two latter, M. du Maine, his\nchildren, and the Count of Toulouse. But until the event it remained a\nmystery. His curiosity satisfied on this point, the Duke of Orleans wished\nto know what would become of himself. That however was not to be seen in\nthe glass. The fellow who was there offered to show it to him as if painted\non the wall of the room, if he was not afraid of seeing himself there ; and\nafter a quarter of an hour of rodomantade before them all, the figure of the\nDuke of Orleans, clothed as he then was, and life-size, appeared suddenly on\nthe wall like a painting, with a closed crown on its head. It was not that of\nFrance, Spain, or England, neither was it an imperial crown. The Duke of\nOrleans who gazed fixedly at it could not guess what it was ; he had never\nseen such a one. It had only four circles, and nothing on the top. This\ncrown covered his head.\nFrom the previous mystery and from this latter one, I took the opportu\nnity of showing him again the folly of this kind of thing, fitting delusions of\nthe devil, permitted by God for the punishment of a curiosity, which He\nforbids, resulting in nothingness and darkness, instead of the light and\ninstruction sought.\nHe was at that time certainly very far from being regent of the\nkingdom, or from thinking of it. That was perhaps what this curious\ncrown announced to him. All this happened in Paris at his mistress's\n\f532 F. W. H. Myers.\nhouse, in the presence of their most intimate circle, the day before he\ntold me of it ; and I thought it so extraordinary, that I have given it\na place here, not to express my approval of it, but to make it known.\n\"St Simon's account,\" a correspondent writes to me, \"is the more\ninteresting because he is not by any means a superstitious man. See\nhis account of Boulainvillier's predictions of deaths,\u2014 some of which\nwere right (apparently) but some wrong. St. Simon speaks of ' la\nfaussete, la vanit\u00e9, et le neant de cette pr\u00e9tendue science qui seduifc\ntant de gens d'esprit' (Edition Cheruel et Regnier, Vol. XI, ch. 7, p.\n153;\u20141715 A. D.) \"\nThe next case was also a matter of serious and immediate record.\nP. 461. From the Rev. T. G. Crippen, Kirton, near Boston.\nSince writing the foregoing paragraph (i.e., P. 460) I have found a\nmemorandum in my father's handwriting, dated January, 1869, in which he\nhad set down particulars of several dreams or presentiments. I will give\nono of them verbatim ; the incidents must have occurred in the early part\nof 1847.\n\" .... I had a dream, and set it down, telling the landlady\nand her daughter the page in my memorandum-book. They wanted to see\nit, but I said 1 No, but they might mark the page,' which they did. Next\nmorning I was sitting at the same table. . . . The postman gave his\ndouble knock, and I said 'Here comes my dream.' Sure enough it was ; for\nthere was a letter from the Board with my promotion, which I did not look for\nfor another year at least. Now the dream was that I saw a letter, read it,\nwent to London ; close by a church that you could go round two sides of,\nI saw a gateway ; I entered, saw a black-looking building with folding doors\nand a side door. (Rough sketch in the margin, unintelligible.) I entered\nand turned up a flight of steps on my right hand, met a very little man and\nhe said 'Welcome, stranger; you are Mr. Crippen.' . . . That was my\ndream at Thorpe-le-Soken. The church was St. Giles in London ; I never\nasked any one, but went straight round [sic.], saw the entrance and all in\nmy dream. The supervisor was a very little man. . . .\"\nBy way of explanation, I may add that the place described as having been\nseen beforehand was a soapery near St. Giles, of which my father had\ncharge as \" Assistant \" for a few months in 1847. I was too young to be\nable to give any corroboration to this narrative from my own knowledge ;\nbut I know that some incidents connected with his removal from Thorpe-le-\nSoken to London at that time made a deep impression on my father's\nmind ; he regarded it as a special occasion for gratitude to God, and several\ntimes spoke of it as such. Thos. Geo. Crippen.\nIt will be observed that Mr. Crippen quotes from a memorandum-\nbook of his father's, which is itself a digest of notes taken at the\ntime. As regards the premonitory vision of Wansford, which follows,\nit is of course possible that the Excise authorities had already\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 533\ncontemplated moving Mr. Crippen to Wansford, and had thought\nof that scene in connection with him, so that it might have been\ntelepathically transferred.\nP. 460.\nFrom the Rev. Thomas George Crippen (Independent Minister), Kirton,\nnear Boston.\nJuly 8th, 1884.\nIn the spring or early summer of 1852, my father was Excise officer at\nMildenhall, Suffolk, and was expecting shortly to be removed to another\nstation. One morning at breakfast he said, \" 1 have had a curious dream ;\nI saw a malt-house standing beside some water ; there were trees, and a\ncrane ; I have never been in such a place, but if I were an artist I could\n\u25a0ketch the scene exactly.\" A few months later the expected order for\nremoval came to hand, and my father, accompanied by my mother and\nmyself, went to the place indicated to make needful arrangements. The\nplace was Dalham, a few miles distant ; and I distinctly remember that as\nwe rode by a malt-house beside a pool, at Dalham, my mother said, \" la\nthat like your dream?\" The reply was \"No, there were boats on that\nwater.\" I may remark that I was then a few weeks under 11 years old.\nWe did not remove to Dalham, the order being countermanded ; but in the\nearly spring of 1854\u2014nearly two years after the dream -my father was\nordered to Wansford, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. We had certainly\nP never been within 40 miles of the place. We arrived at Driffield on a\nSaturday night, and put up at the \"Bell\"; and on the following morning\nmy father and I took a walk around. In the course of our walk we passed\na malt-house and mill, standing beside a large sheet of water, at Nafferton.\nI said, \"Is that like your dream ? \" The reply was \" Something like, and yet\nnot like it.\" We walked on to Wansford\u2014about two miles further\u2014when\nsuddenly my father said \" My dream, Tom, there it is ! There is the malt-\nhouse, and the trees, and the crane, and the water exactly as I saw it.\" The\nplace was Bainton's mill\u2014since known as Nornabell's\u2014about two miles\nfrom Driffield. As I have a distinct remembrance of the dream being the\nsubject of conversation before the visit to Dalham, of the conversation at\nDalham, and of my father's words both at Nafferton and Wansford, I think\nthis may be fairly put on record as an instance of presentiment inexplicable\nby any known natural law.\nThe memorandum contains further details, but I prefer to leave the\nnarrative as it stands, because so far it is within the sphere of my own\ndistinct remembrance.\nThos. Geo. Crippen.\nThe next case is again noteworthy, as coming from a quarter where\nthe slightest conscious embellishment of truth would have been reckoned\nas a sin. \" Fletcher of Madeley \" was one of the chiefest of English\nsaints ; and the premonition which follows is bound up with earthly lives\nthan which few could have approached closer to the life unseen, or have\nlain more manifestly under the oversight and intendancy of heaven.\n\fF. W. H. Myers.\nP. 58.\nFrom the life of Mrs. Mary Fletcher, of Madeley. By the Rev. H.\nMoore, D.D. Vol. I., pp. 241-243.\nOn Mr. Fletcher's death at his parish of Madeley, his widow expected to\nhave to give up their house. In October, 1785, she makes the following\nentry in her journal : \" I received a message from Mr. Kenerson, letting me\nknow I should never be turned out of the house. It brought before my\nmind a dream I had some years before I was married. I dreamed a man\ncame to offer me some tithes. I replied, ' Friend, I have nothing to do\nwith tithes, I have no concern in any living.' But soon after I said to one\nof my family, Hannah, 'I am going away, I have a call from the Lord,\u2014I\nmust go.' But again I thought I knew not where, not even into what\ncountry. However, the way of duty is the way of safety. I will set out, and\nGod will lead me. Immediately I left Cross Hall,1 and after walking a few\npaces I thought I was carried, in a moment, I knew not how, and set down\nin a churchyard, and some one said to me, 'You are to enter into this\nchurch.' I went in, and walking up the aisle, I heard a kind of groan, and\nsaid, ' That is the sound of death. ' When I came out of the church I\nentered into a house which was just by it. As I was on the steps it was said\ninwardly to me, 'This is the habitation which God hath chosen for you.'\nBut I answered, ' Oh, no ! I cannot live here. It is the order of God for\nme to live in Yorkshire.' I went into some rooms, and found in one I\npassed through, a man and woman. In the next was a young woman, with,\na child on her lap. She appeared dying of a consumption, and in great con\nflicts. We soon entered into conversation .... After a time, she told\nme I must come here, and here abide. I replied, ' Oh, no ! I live at Cross\nHall, in Yorkshire, and have a great family and many calls there.' But she\nsaid, ' It is the will of God to bring you here\u2014there is work for you to do.'\nShe added, 'Do not be frightened, God will make you a comfortable\nhabitation.' I said, 'Have you the Gospel here?' She replied, 'Yes.'\n'And who,' said I, 'is the minister that brought it among you?' She\nreplied, 'He is not here now.' 'Then who,' said I, 'is your present\nminister ? ' She showed me a name of three syllables\u2014but I . . . .\ncould only remember the two last\u2014' nerson.' I felt myself in great anguish\nand sorrow of mind, (though I could not assign any cause), and said, ' I\nmust go away, I cannot stay here. I do not know that man and woman. I\ncannot live with them.' She replied, 'That man and woman will go away\nwhen you come. But there is work for you to do, you must abide here.'\n. . . . I went downstairs .... seeing a coach ready to be hired,\nI beckoned to it\u2014the man opened the door ; as I was stepping in he said,\n' Where will you be carried ? ' I strove to say Cross Hall, Yorkshire, but I\ncould not. Then I strove to name various habitations I had formerly lived in,\nbut I could remember the name of none At last I stepped\nback, and pointing to the house I came out of, I said, ' That is my home.\nGod hath taken the remembrance of every other out of my heart.'\nI knew nothing of the situation of anything in Madeley when I liad\nthis dream\u2014but when, some years afterwards, I told my dear Mr. Fletcher,\n1 Cross Hall, Yorkshire, was at this time her home.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 535\nhe said, ' There was a man and woman who lived with me at that time, and\na young woman named A. C, who was very useful in the work, to which she\nproved a nursing mother. She died of a consumption, in which she had\nmany conflicts.' I said, ' Was there a minister here whose name ended in\n'uerson'1' He replied, 'No.' But now I understand it all. Had I before\nremembered the whole name, I should at once have known this dream would\nbe fulfilled at my dear husband's death, as Mr. Kenerson was the patron and\nhis son now became our vicar.\"\nAnd now a case which we may interpret in various ways, but\nwhich yet points to spiritual presences which to this man's sober\napprehension seemed real and near. I quote only so much of the\nnarrative, not now evidential, as may serve to show its parallelism with\nmore modern experience.\nP. 11.\nFrom a letter which appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine (Vol. XXXV.\n1765, pp. 599, 600) headed: \" The Existence of Invisible Foreicarners of\nEvents Asserted.\" This letter bears the signature of J. Cook, M.D., and is\ndated Leigh, September 18th, 1765.\nThe writer, after vouching \" by the living of God \"for the truth of his\nnarrative, says :\u2014\nI \"Ever since I was three and twenty years of age, I have had an invisible\nbeing or beings attend me at times both at home and abroad, that have by\nsome gentle token or other, given me warning and notice that I should\nshortly certainly lose a particular friend, or a patient. They began and con\ntinued from our marriage till the decease of my first wife, in May, 1728, and\nof her infant daughter, who lived with me but seven months, and but six\nweeks after her mother, when they were very frequent and troublesome\nabout my house, as was well-known, and noticed by many of our friends and\nneighbours. After that they came seldom, but so gentle, civil, and familiar,\nthat I chose rather to have them about my house than not, and would not,\nif I was to sell it, part with the same without some extraordinary considera\ntion upon that very account ; and I really hope they will never leave me\nas long as I live ; though my spouse wishes otherwise, to whom they are\nnot so agreeable. . . .\n\"Sometimes we have had their hints frequent and close together ; at\nother times but seldom, and at a great distance of time. But this I have\nobserved, that rarely any patient, or friend that I respected, or that valued\nme, departs hence, but I have some kind of sensible notice, or warning of it ;\nbut yet so discreet and mild, as never to flutter, or frighten me. This notice,\nwhich is either by seeing, feeling, or hearing, is not fixed to any certain\ndistance of time previous to their deaths, but I have had it a week, a month,\nand more, before their decease, and once only three days, when I actually\nheard the spiritual agent form an articulate voice, and utter these words, as\nI was abed, with a most pathetic emphasis, ' I am gone ; ' which was\nfulfilled the Monday morning following, by the sudden death of my cousin's\ndaughter, who was upon a visit at my house, and was well two days before.\"\n\f536 F. W. H. Myers.\nTowards the end of his letter he adds that the voice came \" just as I had\nput out my candle, and was laid down in my bed,\" etc. . . .\n\" My spouse was fast asleep by me, so missed being witness of that\nnotice ; though she often is, and some of my sons too, and many\nothers.\" . . .\n\" At first, in 1728, I kept a book of account, where I entered every\nnotice or warning, with the particular circumstances attending, and the\nevent that succeeded such notices, but they were so frequent and numerous\nthat I grew quite weary in writing them down, so left off that method,\nresolving to take them for the future just as they came. The very last hint\nI had was on Saturday night, the 6th of July 1765, in my chamber, about\neleven o'clock, as I was walking to my bed, being from home attending a\npatient I was that morning sent for to, and which I lost on the 20th day of\nthe same month. For the first five days I saw no danger ; yet I doubted the\nevent ; but when I have more than one patient dangerously ill at a time,\nthe issue only determines the case, and though I lay no stress upon such\nnotices, so as to affect my practice, yet I fear the worst, and though the use\nof means is then to no purpose, yet it renders me the more diligent for\nconscience' sake.\"\nIt is interesting to set beside these old cases some modern\nexamples, where like intimations are still given through the same\nchannels as before.\nThe case next to be given has the rare peculiarity of involving- )\na definite date,\u2014the day of the month, a few months ahead,\u2014on\nwhich the premonition was to fulfil itself.1 The matter involved was\na private one, and I am able to give the case only in outline.\n(P. 223.) In December, 1889, I received from Miss X. a' sealed\nenvelope containing a date. Miss X. stated that a premonition in\nauditory form\u2014a voice often heard before at crises, and which\nshe had always trusted\u2014had deferred to the date therein-mentioned\nthe decision of a matter as to which she had been in great\nanxiety, and which she had been daily expecting to be obliged\nto decide. It did not then appear to her likely that the decision\nshould be so long deferred ; nor was it essential that an actual\nmeeting should take place ; but she resolved to do nothing\neither to help or hinder the fulfilment of the prediction. The date in\nquestion found her, in fact, at a distance from London (where the\nquestion would have to be settled), and likely to remain in the\ncountry. An unexpected summons from an invalid relative brought\nher back to London,\u2014the cause of the summons being the sudden\nillness of a maid. Miss X. arrived in London, and an accidental\nvisitor at the relative's house invited her impromptu to an enter\ntainment at which she met the friend upon whom the matter\n' See Mr. Edisbury's case, Vol. VII., p. 318.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 537\ndepended\u2014although that friend was previously a stranger to her\nhosts of the evening.\nMiss X. then wrote to tell me of this fact, and Mrs. Sidgwick and I,\nopening the sealed letter together, found that the date given therein\ncorresponded to that on which the predicted meeting and decision had\nnow actually taken place.\nIn the next case a date is also obscurely given.\n.\nP. 643. Dream. Cf. Phantasms of the Living, Case (79).\nFrom the Rev. E. D. Banister, Whitechapel Vicarage, Preston,\nLancashire.\n[November 12th, 1885.]\nMy father, whilst a schoolboy (probably from 1808-1815), had a dream\nrelating to his future, which I and my sister have often heard him relate.\nIn the dream he saw a tablet in the parish church of his native place, on\nwhich was inscribed his name in full, the date of his birth, and the day and\nmonth, but not the year, of his death. But there seemed to him to be\nsomething uncertain about the month in the date of his death. The date\nas inscribed on the tablet was Jun. 9. But as June is seldom, if ever,\nabbreviated as Jun., he was somewhat inclined to think that it might be\nJan. 9.\n' Many years elapsed after the dream, and nothing occurred to recall the\ncircumstance until on June 9th, 1835, my eldest brother died at the age of\ntwo years and ten months. My father at the time was very deeply affected\nby the loss of the child. The date of the child's death called to his mind\nthe date on the tablet, and though in his dream he distinctly saw his own\nname, he ever afterwards favoured the idea that the date he had seen was\nJun. 9.\nOn January 9th, 1883, my father died.\nMr. Banister's sister confirms as follows :\u2014\nI have seen my brother's letter respecting the dream of which I have\nheard my father speak, and can only say that the facts are as my brother\nhas stated. AGnea Banister.\nTo what extent departed human spirits may be concerned in\nmessages like these is a problem which only a much wider collection of\nevidence can enable us to solve. I have already alluded to certain cases\nwhich seem to show us a departed friend foretelling some death which\nmay or may not have been already recognised as imminent by observers\non earth. It is suggested thus that the disembodied spirit can better\ndiscern the invalid's condition, and remains at hand to receive him\nwhen the transition comes.\nIn several families there is a tradition that some special sign\nprecedes or accompanies the transition of the head of the house, or of\n\f538 F.

In the case of one of these families, I have\nreceived evidence to the persistence of a given type of \" warning \"\nduring a period of three centuries.\nP. 232.\nExtract from Dr. Robert Plot's \"Natural History of Oxfordshire.\" Edited\n1677.

Pages 204 and 205).\nI. \" I must add also a Relation, as strange as it is true, of the Family of\none Captain Wood, late of Bampton, Oxfordshire, now of Brise Norton, Captain\nin the late Wars for the King. Some whereof before their death have had\nwarning given them by a certain knocking, either at the door without or on\na table or shelves within ; the number of stroaks and distance between them,\nand the place where, for the most part respecting the circumstances of the\npersons to dye, or their deaths themselves, as will easily be collected\nfrom the following relation. The first knocking that was heard, or at\nleast observed, was about a year after the Restoration of the King, in the\nafternoon, or a little before night, at or upon the door it being then given,\nas it was apprehended by Mrs. Elenor Wood, mother to Captain Basil Wood,\nwho only heard it, none being about the house but herself ; at which she\nwas very much disturbed, thinking it boded some ill to her or hers, and\nwithin fourteen nights after, she had news of the death of her son-in-law,\nMr. George Smith, who dyed in London.\nII. \"About three years after that, there were three great knocks given\nvery audibly to all that were then in the house, viz., to the aforesaid\nMrs. Elenor Wood, Mr. Basil Wood, and his wife, Mrs. Hester, and some\nservants ; which knocks were so remarkable that one of the maids came\nfrom the well, which was about twenty yards from the place, to see what\nwas the matter ; and Mrs. Elenor Wood, and another maid that was within\nthe house, saw three great pans of lard shake and totter so upon a shelf in\nthe milk house that they were like to fall down. Upon this violent\nknocking, Mr. Basil Wood and his wife, being then in the hall, came pre\nsently into the milk house to their mother, where finding her somewhat\ndisturbed, and enquiring the reason, she replied, ' God Almighty only knew\nthe matter ;' she could tell nothing, but she heard the knocking ; which being\nwithin doors, Mr. Basil Wood concluded was for some of the family at home,\nthat upon the door being for a friend abroad ; which accordingly fell out,\nthree of the family, according to the number of the knocks, dying within\nlittle more than half a year after, viz., Mrs. Hester Wood, wife to Mr. Basil\nWood, a child of Mr. Wood's sister, and Mrs. Elenor Wood, his mother.\nIII. \"About August, 1674, Mr. Basil Wood, junior, son of the Mr. Basil\nWood aforesaid, living at Exeter, in Devonshire, heard the same kind of\nknocking, at which being disturbed, he wrote word of it to his father here at\nBampton, in Oxfordshire ; viz., 'That one Sunday he and his wife and her\nsister and his brother did distinctly hear upon a Table in their chamber, as\nthey stood by it, two several knocks struck as it were with a cudgel, one of\nthem before and the other after morning prayer, a little before dinner ; '\nwhich letter was shown to Mr. Wood, senior, (as the other knockings before\nthe deaths of any that dyed were beforehand told) to several neighbouring\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 539\ngentlemen ; after which within about fourteen days,1 Mrs. Hester Wood, a\nsecond wife of Mr. Basil Wood, senior, and about a quarter of a year after,\nher father, Mr. Richard Lisset, dyed both at Bampton ; since which time\nthey have heard nothing more as yet.\"\nIV.

Woodd died December 15th, 1893, between 8 and 9 a. m.\nAugust 21tt, 1895.\nOn Thursday evening, December 14th, 1893, after church I was\nsitting before my fire\u2014I knew my father was ill, and had a presentiment\nthat he was dangerously ill, though if I had known this I should have\nremained at Hampstead, where I had been that day. As I sat, I distinctly\nheard three knocks, perhaps more, like the sound of some one emptying a\ntobacco pipe upon the bars of my fire-grate.\nThinking it may be a warning, I did not go to bed for an hour, thinking I\nmight be sent for. At 1 a.m. the butler, Arthur Reading, came, and I was\nawakened from sleep by ringing of the front door bell and knocking. He\ntold me the doctor had sent for me, as my father was very ill; and he would be\nback in twenty minutes whilst I dressed, to take me to Hampstead. He went\nto Westminster for medical appliances. In half an hour he had not returned,\nand I said to my housekeeper, Elizabeth Park, \"I must go. I feel sure my\nfather is dying, because I heard the Woodd knocks as I sat in my chair before\ngoing to bed.\"\nA hansom cab passed and I ordered the man to drive as fast as he could\nto Roslyn (Hampstead). On my arrival my first question was, \" Is he\nstill alive ? \" for I believed he must have passed away at the time of the\nknocking. He died at 8.45 next morning.\"\n(Signed) Trevor Basil Woodd.\n(Assistant Curate, S.

At 11 o'clock\nat night, being tired and finding I could not assist my mother or the nurso, I\nlay down in an adjoining room leaving the door wide open and I fell asleep. In\na short time I was suddenly awakened by a loud rapping as if at the door. I\njumped up and ran into the passage thinking my mother had called me. I\nlistened at the door of my father's room, but no one was moving. I lay down\nagain and instantly fell asleep, when exactly the same thing occurred. I did\nnot actually sleep again, and cannot say whether any sound made me get up\nthe third time, but I went in search of the doctor and gathered that he was\nanxious about my father, who was getting much weaker. We were all aroused,\nand about 8 o'clock a.m. my father died.\nWinifred Dujibell, nee Woodd.\nI did not connect this rapping with the Woodd warning, as all was so rapid\nand unexpected, but on mentioning it at breakfast the next morning to my\nbrother, the Rev. Trevor Basil Woodd, he told mo he also heard a similar\nwarning in his rooms in Vauxhall Bridge-road about the same time.\nVII. Basil Thomas Woodd died June 4th, 1895, 10.30 p.m. His two\ndaughters send me the following statement :\u2014\nOn June 3rd, at 10.30 p.m., Fanny, his daughter, staying with Mrs.\nStoney, 83, Wharton-road, West Kensington, heard knocks, apparently\nfrom next door, as of nails being hammered in and pictures hung, which\nseemed so unlikely at that hour of night that the next morning she men\ntioned it to Mrs. Stoney, whose bedroom was just below hers, asking if she\nhad heard it or could account for it. At the same hour Kate, his youngest\ndaughter, who was with him at his brother Robert's house, Woodlands,\nHampstead, having retired for the night, heard bangs or thumps against the\nwindows below, which made her suspect burglars. The next day, the 4th,\nFanny left Mrs. Stoney to go to Woodlands, and Kate was to leave on the\n5th. Mr. Woodd was in his usual health, and was with the family at dinner,\nchatting and telling Yorkshire stories, but had no appetite and ate nothing,\nand at 10 was seized with the apopletic attack from which he never rallied,\nand breathed his last at 10.30 p.m. Fanny L Woodd\nKate I.

Something-\ninterrupted us, or I should have remarked on the strangeness of my not having\nheard, as my room is just under Miss Woodd's, and the noise heard by one\ncould not have failed to disturb the other.

I may add I am not superstitious, nor was I\nexpecting that my uncle was in danger. I and my sister were staying at the\ntime at Oughtershaw, Skipton-in-Craven. \u2014Believe me, yours truly,\nGertrude J. Woodd.\nRoslyn, Hampstead, N.W., August 5th, 1895.\nDear Sir,\u2014My cousin, Miss Woodd, of Conyingham Hall, Knaresborough,\nasked me to send you my own experiences of what I believe to be the \"Woodd\nknockings.\" I am not superstitious in these ways, but one night about 10\np.m. I heard in my bedroom a sound as of some one hammering nails into a\nwall. My sister slept next door and remembers that the next morning I\nasked her if she had been putting up something on her wall, after retiring for\nthe night. She said she had not, and I thought little more about it. There\nwas no one else about in that part of the house. This took place, as far as I\ncan remember, several days before I heard of the death of my uncle, Mr.\nBasil Woodd, which took place at the residence of my uncle, Mr. Robert\nWoodd, of Hampstead, on Tuesday, June 4th. We did not hear of the event\nuntil the following Thursday, June 6th. \u2014Yours truly,\nEthel G. Woodd.\nCan it be possible that when communication of this sort has been\nfound feasible by some group on the other side there is a continuity of\neffort to sustain it ? or that each decedent in succession finds in the\nprevious history a suggestion to attempt a similar message himself ? or\nthat there is in the family a hereditary aptitude for the same type of\npercipience ?\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 543\nIn various ways, indeed, our evidence suggests that approaching\ndeath may bring about a rapprochement between incarnate and dis-\ncarnate souls of which such evidential incidents as we can get hold of\ngive but a partial glimpse.

From that time he was in\nfailing health. Early in February, 1887, he grew rapidly worse, and was\nordered to Bournemouth. About midnight one Saturday night (I think it was\nthe 23rd of February) [February 23rd, 1887, was a Wednesday; and, therefore,\nMrs. Jameson says in a later letter, her vision must have occurred on the\n26th], while he was at Bournemouth, I was lying awake in bed, the gas\nbeing full on, when I fancied that I saw a grave with a small white stone\nlying, and one in an upright position. These stones suddenly changed to a\nleaden hue, and upon the flat stone I saw a basket of exquisite flowers, all\nwhite, and such as I have not beheld before or since. On the top of all the\nflowers was a very large tiger lily. Immediately following this I felt a\n\" presence near me, but could see nothing, and it flashed into my mind that\nmy brother had died at Bournemouth. Shortly after I saw him in my\nbedroom with a lady, whose arm was linked in his. Her face I did not\nsee, as they were a little in advance of me. I saw his, and recognised his\nform. He was on the side nearest to me. The lady was draped as a\nwell-dressed bride, and veiled. Her dress was white and glistening.\nHe was in ordinary clothing, and they were both very happy. I also\nheard distinctly the low murmur of voices, and heard, too, her glad\nlaugh. (This increased my belief that he had died, and that this lady was his\nwife.) They were in mid-air, and were quite unconscious of my presence,\nand seemed to glide rather than walk. After advancing a little they stood still,\nmy brother seeming reluctant to go on. After lingering a moment the lady\nvanished, leaving my brother as one deep in thought, but still hesitating ;\nshe reappeared for an instant, and, as it seemed, enticed him to follow her.\nBut he still seemed unwilling to go with her, and she vanished finally, and\nafter a few more moments lingering, my brother followed in the same direc\ntion that the lady had vanished. He returned to London about a fortnight\nafter this vision, and died on the 23rd of March, 1887, very suddenly, and the\nmemory of this wonderful experience will, I feel, be always sacred to me. The\nsurprising part to me is, that throughout the whole of this I was possessed\nwith a feeling of calmness and utter absence of fear. Miriam Jameson\nMr. Jameson writes :- April ^ 18gg.\nMy own share in the proceedings narrated was as follows. I was, on the\nnight referred to, sitting at work in my study\u2014not far from our bedroom\u2014\n2 q 2\n\fF. W. H. Myers.\nwhen my wife called me, and said that she felt sure her brother was in the\nbedroom. I said, \" You are nervous. I will come to bed.\" I had scarcely\ndone so when she sat up, and began to describe to me what is stated in her\nnarrative as to seeing her brother, &c. I saw nothing. My wife was com\nposed, but her face was very animated and her eyes glistened. She looked\nand spoke just as a good actress would, in describing scene and action not\nvisible to her audience.\nOur little son, then about 18 months old, had been taken into our bed \u2014\nbeing wakeful. He was wideawake, and was prattling and trying to caress\nhis mother, while she told me what she was seeing. His interruptions\nseemed to hinder my wife from hearing what her brother said, for she\nhushed the little one repeatedly.\nThe orphan child, about two years old, of my brother-in-law, who had\nbeen with us from the time of her mother's death, was sleeping in an\nadjoining room.\nI may add that. although I am acquainted with several well-known\nSpiritualists, I have never (nor has' my wife) taken much interest in\nSpiritualistic phenomena. I mention this to show that prepossession\nwould not account for my wife's remarkable experience.\nMy own mind is still in suspense on the point whether that experience\nwas not purely subjective, although I cannot but admit that I have been\ndeeply impressed by the fact of the intense objective reality of that\nexperience to my wife. William Jameson.\nIn answer to inquiries, Mrs. Jameson informs us :\u2014\n1. That she never had any other hallucination of sight, hearing, or any\nother sense.\n2. There was no point of coincidence with fact in the two tombstones,\nthe tiger lily, &c.\n3. She thinks the interval of time between the vision of tombstones and\nthe vision of figures was about five or ten minutes. \" The white stones\nchanged soon and suddenly, the leaden hue lasted longer, then came the\nflowers. Then Ifelt the unseen presence, and on turning round or over to\nmy little son, who began to chatter, these figures appeared together, as I have\ntold you, and I sat up in bed and watched them steadfastly until they\nvanished close to the outer wall of the house.\"\n4. The walls, the gas full on, and all in her bedroom, were visible to her,\nbut she\/eit that her brother and the lady had an environment of their own.\nShe remembers most distinctly her brother's curly hair.\n5. She does not think that she had been more than usually anxious about\nher brother. She had been speaking of him, and had written to him that day.\n6. She never mentioned the vision to her brother, and does not know\nanything about him on the night in question , except that she heard on the\nMonday that he had seemed a little better on Saturday night.\nThe vision affected her very much.\nAnd now for three narratives, or rather groups of narratives,\nwhere unseen protection or guidance seems to be suggested. I leave\nthe first in the original French, in the hope that its publication may\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 545\nbring other narratives of the same kind, from countries where com\npulsory military service is in vogue.\nP. 147.\nThe following interesting cases of presentiment were sent to us by Pro\nfessor G. Hulin, of the University of Ghent, who wrote to Professor\nSidgwick on April 13th, 1894 :\u2014\nGhent, Place de l'Ev\u00each\u00e9, 3.\nDear Sir, \u2014At the congress of Psychology held at Paris in 1889, I had\nthe honour of making your acquaintance, and had a conversation with your\nself and Mrs. Sidgwick about second sight and similar subjects. At that\ntime, I had never within my immediate experience come across any certain\nand well-established fact of the sort. Since then I had the occasion of\nobserving a case of presentiment which struck me because it is certified by\ntrustworthy witnesses, and if a mere coincidence, it is certainly a most\nextraordinary one. So, although I own I am still rather sceptical about\nthat class of phenomena, I send you herewith a narrative of the facts,\nthinking the case may interest you. 1 take the liberty of writing it in\nFrench, as I want to be sure of the correctness of my statements.\nGeorges Hulin.\nVers le commencement de l'hiver 1890-91, un jeune homme du nom de\nCharles-Louis Casset, du village de Loo-ten-Hulle (Flandre Orientale) o\u00f9 ma\nfamille a sa r\u00e9sidence d'\u00e9t\u00e9, annon\u00e7a, pr\u00e8s de deux mois \u00e0 l'avance, qu'il\nam\u00e8nerait au tirage au sort pour la milice, le num\u00e9ro 90 (on sait que le\nrecrutement de l'arm\u00e9e Belge se fait par voie de conscription). Plusieurs\npersonnes entendirent cette pr\u00e9diction, faite sur un ton de parfaite assurance,\net qu'il renouvela devant le commissaire d'arrondissement pr\u00e9sidant au\ntirage au sort. A la stup\u00e9faction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ce num\u00e9ro sortit en effet.\nLe bruit en \u00e9tant parvenu \u00e0 nos oreilles, je voulus m'assurer de\nl'authenticit\u00e9 du fait, et interrogeai plusieurs personnes, entre autres la m\u00e8re\ndu jeune homme. Tous m'affirm\u00e8rent avoir entendu la pr\u00e9diction. Je\nm'adressai alors au commissairo d'arrondissement, M. van Dooren, qui\nme donna l'attestation \u00e9crite que voici :\n. . . . \" Cette ann\u00e9e-ci, le milicien Casset, Ch8 L*, de Loo-ten-\nHulle, me demande, avant de tirer, si le no 90 se trouvait encore dans\nl'urne ; sur ma r\u00e9ponse affirmative il s'\u00e9cria : 'C'est celui-l\u00e0 qu'il me faut ! '\nAppel\u00e9 \u00e0 tirer, il amena en effet le num\u00e9ro 90.\n\"Le Commissaire d'Arrondissement,\n(Sign\u00e9) \"Jules van Dooren.\"\nEn pr\u00e9sence de ce t\u00e9moignage officiel le doute n'\u00e9tait plus permis. Tr\u00e8s in\ntrigu\u00e9, je t\u00e2chai de savoir comment le jeune homme avait eu ce pressentiment.\nAu printemps, quand mes parents furent retourn\u00e9s \u00e0 Loo-ten-Hulle, je le\nfis venir \u00e0 la maison, et l'interrogeai. Jusque-l\u00e0 il n'avait voulu r\u00e9pondre\n\u00e0 personne ; sans doute je lui inspirai plus de confiance, car, apr\u00e8s quelques\nh\u00e9sitations, il me fit le r\u00e9cit suivant.\nComme la plupart des fils de petits cultivateurs, il avait grand peur du\nservice militaire, qui devait priver sa famille de son travail. Plusieurs mois\nd'avance il \u00e9tait donc pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 et anxieux, et pensait constamment au jour\nfatal du tirage au sort.\n\f546 F. W. H. Myers.\nEnviron deux mois avant celui-ci, une nuit qu'il venait de se coucher il\nvit dans un coin de sa chambre une forme indistincte, mais grande et\n\u00e9lev\u00e9e, de sorte que de son lit il devait lever les yeux pour la voir. La seule\nchose qu'il pouvait clairement percevoir, c'\u00e9tait la chiffre 90 en grands carac\nt\u00e8res, \" espac\u00e9s d'environ un poing.\"\nIl se souleva, ferma les yeux et les rouvrit pour bien s'assurer qu'il ne\nr\u00eavait point. L'apparition \u00e9tait toujours l\u00e0, aussi ind\u00e9niable qu'au premier\nmoment. Saisi de frayeur, il se mit \u00e0 prier, et ainsi, peu \u00e0 peu, s'endormit.\nD\u00e8s le premier moment il avait eu l'intuition que ce nombre 90 \u00e9tait\ncelui qu'il tirerait et que c'\u00e9tait un bon num\u00e9ro.\nA partir de cette nuit, il eut l'esprit tout-\u00e0-fait tranquille et dit \u00e0 tous\nceux qui s'\u00e9tonnaient de ce calme qu'il savait qu'il aurait le num\u00e9ro 90. On\ncrut d'abord \u00e0 une plaisanterie, mais il affirmait cela avec tant de conviction\nque bient\u00f4t il excita la curiosit\u00e9.\nComme je lui demandais s'il avait dans sa vie eu d'autres visions, il me\ndit que non, mais que, apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re apparition, il eut souvent la m\u00eame\nvision, m\u00eame le jour, pendant son travail. Il ajoutait judicieusement que ce\nn'\u00e9taient plus sans doute de vraies apparitions, mais seulement l'effet de\nson imagination vivement frapp\u00e9e.\nCependant il croit avoir r\u00e9ellement revu l'apparition myst\u00e9rieuse dans la\nchambre o\u00f9 se faisait le tirage au sort, avant de plonger la main dans le\ntambour. Il dit au pr\u00e9sident qu'il \u00e9tait inutile qu'il tir\u00e2t, que son num\u00e9ro\n\u00e9tait 90. Le pr\u00e9sident lui r\u00e9pondit de ne pas plaisanter et de prendre un\nbillet. En tendant celui-ci au pr\u00e9sident il r\u00e9p\u00e9ta que c'\u00e9tait 90.\nCe r\u00e9cit me fut fait avec un grand air de sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de scrupuleuse\nexactitude. Le jeune homme, qui semble doux et intelligent, parlait \u00e0 voix\nbasse avec une \u00e9motion visible, et me demanda de ne rien dire aux autres\nhabitants du village. H croit \u00e9videmment \u00e0 une intervention surnaturelle.\nJe m'adressai encore au commissaire d'arrondissement pour lui\ndemander s'il se rappelait d'autres cas o\u00f9 des miliciens avaient pr\u00e9dit le\nnum\u00e9ro qu'ils tireraient. A cette \u00e9poque (1891) il ne s'en rappelait qu'un\nseul, qu'il voulut bien me certifier par \u00e9crit en m\u00eame temps que celui\nrapport\u00e9 plus haute :\n. . . \"en 1886, au tirage au sort, \u00e0 Eeclo le milicien Masco\n(Ferdinand), de cette ville, m'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, avant le tirage, qu'il am\u00e8nerait le\nno 112, ce qui fut vrai.\"\nDepuis, il m'a signal\u00e9 trois autres cas : l'hiver dernier ou le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent (sa\nlettre n'est malheureusement pas dat\u00e9e, et mes souvenirs ne sont pas pr\u00e9cis\nsur ce point), il m'\u00e9crivait ce qui suit :\n\" Un fait bizarre et digne d'\u00eatre racont\u00e9 s'est produit mercredi dernier\nau tirage au sort pour la milice \u00e0 Maldeghem. Un inscrit du nom de\nPamvels (Edouard), de la commune d'Adeghem, en s'approchant de l'urne\nd\u00e9clara hautement au commissaire d'arrondissement qui pr\u00e9sidait la s\u00e9ance,\nqu'il am\u00e8nerait le no 216, et ce fut en effet ce num\u00e9ro qu'il tira et qui fut\nproclam\u00e9. Il y avait encore au moins 150 num\u00e9ros dans le tambour. Le\nplus bas num\u00e9ro \u00e9tait 46 et le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 223.\"\nEnfin, cet hiver m\u00eame, il m'a envoy\u00e9 avec sa carte de visite un journal\ncontenant l'entrefilet ci-joint, concernant deux nouveaux cas constat\u00e9s par\nlui-m\u00eame.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 547\nThe newspaper cutting enclosed is as follows :\u2014 FeVrier 1894\nTiraoe au Sort.\u2014Deux faits bizarres se sont produits au tirage au sort\nqui eut lieu a Eecloo samedi dernier.\nLe milicien Camille Pyfferoen, s'approchant de l'urne, d\u00e9clare a M. le\ncommissaire d'arrondissement, qui presidait les operations, qu'il avait revi,\nla nuit passee, qu'il amenait le numdro 111, et qu'il etait convaincu que le\nsort l'aurait favorisd de ce bon numero.\nL'iuteressd amena, en effet, le no 111. M. le commissaire lui ayant\n( demand^ si ce qu'il avait d\u00e9clare eteit bien reel, le milicien appela son pere\nen confirmation de ses dires.\nUn second milicien, Louis Crispyn, annouga qu'il amdnerait le no 116 ;\nmais sur l'observation que celui-ci \u00e9tait d\u00e9ja tird, il declare qu'il prendrait\nalors le numero pr\u00e9cedent, et il tira, en effet, le no 115.\nThese cases of conscription-numbers foretold seem to me much\nmore impressive than the somewhat similar dreams of races of which\nwe have printed several specimens ; since the event is absolutely\nincalculable, the numerical chance against success is much greater,\nand the testimony of the presiding officer on so serious an\noccasion carries weight. The nearest parallel which I can find to these\nincidents is the guiding of Mr. Stainton Moses' hand to open a book at\na particular page (Proceedings, Vol. XI., p. 106). It seems perhaps\n\u201e less incredible that some suggestion at the moment should have\nguided the fortunate percipient to the lucky number\u2014which his less\nfortunate comrades must also have been guided to leave ready for\nhim\u2014than that the exact disposition of the numbers in the urn should\nhave been foreseen months beforehand by any finite intelligence. Of\ncourse, however, we cannot tell how many conscripts may have dreamt\n\u2014and announced\u2014that they will draw a particular number, and have\nfailed to draw it.\nThe second case in this series is in many ways noteworthy. I\nplace it here because it looks as though suggestion had been exercised\nupon the railway porter to prevent him from asking for the ticket,\nmuch as upon the conscripts to cause them to draw the desired number.\nThere is also premonition as regards various incidents of the journey.\nP. 220.\nThe narrative which follows is of an unusual and complex type. Its main\npurport is concerned with a continued knowledge of terrene affairs evinced\nby a departed spirit. But this, the kernel of the case, must be kept entirely\nsecret, for reasons affecting survivors ; which reasons, so far as I can judge\nfrom a very partial knowledge of them, are entirely sufficient. For the same\nreasons the true names (all of which are known to me) have had to be\naltered throughout and various details omitted. Thus deprived of its\ncentral significance the narrative presents the following type.\nMrs. Claughton (here so-called) visits a house reputed haunted. She\nthere twice sees a phantasm, which she is able to describe ; the description\n\f548 F. W. H. Myers.\nsuiting a deceased lady unknown to her, who had lived in that house. There\nis external evidence to the fact that she twice saw this phantom and was\ngreatly impressed. The phantom appeared to speak at some length ; and\nmade many statements of facts unknown to Mrs. Claughton. Some of these\nwere such as could be at once verified ; and they were found correct. Others\nrelated to an expedition which Mrs. Claughton was enjoined to make to a\nvillage, here called Meresby, of which she had not previously heard. Certain\npersons whom she would find there were described by name and with\nother details. Certain incidents of her future journey thither were also\ndescribed ; thus bringing this case within our definition of premonitions ;\nalthough it may be urged that the fulfilment of the predictions was\naccomplished by suggestions given to certain persons by the disembodied\nintelligence ; so that no true precognition was needed. Mrs. Claughton\nwent to Meresby and found all as foretold. She there received (as had also\nbeen foretold) additional communications ; and she then obeyed certain\norders as to the communication of facts to survivors. That she made the\njourney, and certain subsequent visits, is proved by external evidence. As\nto the messages to survivors, nothing is known beyond Mrs. Claughton's\nown statement that they effected the intended results.\nThis whole story is no doubt very different from the usual tenor of our\nnarratives, and much more resembles some of the figments of romance. On\nthe other hand the evidence for the external facts of the narrative is\nabsolutely conclusive. There is (as will be seen) no doubt whatever that\nMrs. Claughton did make the journey to Meresby, giving as her reason\nsome message conveyed to her on an occasion when she undoubtedly was\nfound fainting in the middle of the night. There is no doubt that at\nMeresby she obtained admission to the church at a similar hour of the\nnight ; nor that after so visiting the church she paid certain other visits to\npersons previously strangers to her.\nNor has any explanation due either to self-interest or to insanity been\nsuggested, so far as I can discover, by any of the persons concerned. The\nwhole expedition was a source merely of trouble and embarrassment to Mrs.\nClaughton, who left a sick child to attend to the alleged injunction, under\ncircumstances of much inconvenience, and with no possible advantage to\nherself.\nAn explanation from insanity or hysterical desire of notoriety is equally\nuntenable. Mrs. Claughton is a widow lady, moving in good society, with\nchildren growing up, and known to many persons as a cheerful, capable,\nactive woman, who has seen much of the world, and has plenty of business\nof her own to attend to ;\u2014and who is by no means given to dwelling on\nthings morbid or mysterious. She has, indeed, had some previous ex\nperiences of apparitions, which all appear to have been vendical, but she has\npaid but little attention to them, and has never sought to encourage such\nvisitations in any way.\nThis present adventure she kept as quiet as she could ; but other people\nhad heard vaguely of it, and she was annoyed by distorted versions ; so that\nshe ultimately consented to give to the Marquis of Bute, and through him\nto our Society, her own account of such incidents as she did not, for the\nsake of survivors, feel bound to conceal.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 549\nThe written evidence now existing may be divided into three parts.\nI.\u2014Mrs. Claughton's own diary, written mainly in pencil, before, during,\nand after the Moresby journey. This diary bears the marks of hasty writing\nand is dated from day to day and in parts from hour to hour, during the\nevents which interest us. This diary contains the secret matter, and has\nnot been entrusted by Mrs. Claughton to any one ; but Lord Bute and\nI have been allowed to read portions of it, and to observe the dates of the\nimportant entries therein.\nAlong with this diary must be classed a document which I am allowed to\nreproduce almost in toto ; viz., a sheet of memoranda made by Mrs.\nClaughton before her Meresby visit, as to what was to happen to her there,\nand what she was to do. I became possessed of this document in the\nfollowing manner.\nMrs Claughton had stated that she was told beforehand [by the phantom]\nthat her ticket (the outward half of a return-ticket) would not be asked\nfor on her arrival at Meresby ; and that in fact it was not asked for.\nThat it was not asked for is proved by the fact that Mrs. Claughton\nsent it to the Dr. Ferrier of the story, who testifies to having possessed\nit, and to having seen a letter from the Railway Company stating that no\nother ticket had been issued from London for Meresby by the train in\nquestion. But Mrs. Claughton had not mentioned the prediction as to the\nticket to Dr. Ferrier before her journey. I therefore asked her orally\nwhether she had made any memorandum of her own as to the ticket before\n- that journey. At my request she at once brought her packet of private\npapers connected with the case ; searched amongst them in my presence,\nand found a paper of memoranda as to what she was to do and to expect on\nthe journey, written before starting. Cutting off a part of that paper which\ndealt with the secret matters, she gave me the rest and I reproduce it\nbelow. The porter's omission to take the ticket is therefore predicted in\nwriting before the event, along with many other particulars as to the\nMeresby visit.\nII.\u2014The second main piece of evidence is an account, written by Mr.\nAndrew Lang, the well-known author, and sent by him to the S.P.R.,\nembodying the written and oral statements of Dr. Ferrier (and of another\nfriend) communicated verbally while Mrs. Claughton was actually on her\njourney, and in writing before the incidents and result of that journey were\nknown. Mr. Lang's account thus reproduces Mrs. Claughton's preliminary\nstatement to Dr. Ferrier, in which some trifling errors have been since\ncorrected in notes by Mrs. Claughton. As to this statement, and the ticket\nincident especially, Dr. Ferrier writes to me, June 10, 1895: \"I do not\npossess the ticket, but Mrs. Claughton sent it to me, and I gave it up, in\norder that enquiries might be made about it, as I thought she had perhaps\ntaken two tickets, and that this was the unused one. I saw, but do not\npossess the letter from the Railway Company stating that the ticket in\nquestion was the only one issued by that train from London to Meresby, and\nthat they were not able to account for it not having been given up. I\npossess the letter from, the Curate of Meresby to the Rev. Mr. Johnson,\nwhich confirmed in a general way the account given by Mrs. Claughton of\nher doings there.\"\n\f550 F. W. H. Myers.\nOf the account given to Mr. Lang, Dr. Ferrier says : \"It was revised,\nthough not signed by me. I would rather trust to ita accuracy than to my\npresent recollection of the circumstances of the case.\"\nIII.\u2014The third main document is the account dictated by Mrs. Claughton\nto Lord Bute, May 17th, 1895, giving for the first time an authentic history\nof the journey to Meresby. This account is supported by corroborative\nletters from persons concerned. It will be well to begin with this account\nas the substantive statement, and to add other papers as corroboration.\nStatement made by Mrs. Claughton to the Marquis of Bute.\nMrs. Claughton is constitutionally second-sighted, as are many members\nof her family, and has had frequent psychical experiences, but has never\ntried to excite the faculty by artificial means, such as crystal gazing\nor sitting for raps. She has sat as a joke with her hands on tables\nwhich moved, but she cannot tell whether the movement was connected\nwith her.\nShe was staying in 1893 with her two children at 6, Blake-street, a house\nbelonging to Mrs. Appleby, daughter of the late Mrs. Blackburn (who died\nafter three days' residence, December 22nd, 1878, of a wasting illness, which\nhad lasted three years), but let to Mr. Buckley. They had so done at least\nfive or six times before, during about seven years. Had heard the house\nwas haunted, and may have heard the ghost was Mrs. Blackburn's. Had\nbeen told water was found spilt on the floors inexplicably. They arrived on\nOctober 4th. About 1.15 a.m., Monday, October 9th, Mrs. Claughton was\nin bed with one of her children, the other sleeping in the room. Mrs.\nClaughton had offered to be of any use she could to Miss Buckley, who\nhad arrived from London unwell on the Saturday. She had been asleep,\nand was awakened by the footsteps of a person coming downstairs, whom\nshe supposed to be a servant coming to call her to Miss Buckley. The\nstops stopped at the door. The sounds were repeated twice more at the\ninterval of a few moments. Mrs. Claughton rose, lit the candle, and opened\nthe door. There was no one there. She noticed the clock outside was at\n1.20. She shut the door, got into bed, read, and leaving the candle burning,\nwent to sleep. Woke up, finding the candle spluttering out. Heard a sound\nlike a sigh. Saw a woman standing by the bed. She had a soft white shawl\nround the shoulders, held by the right hand towards the left shoulder,\nbending slightly forwards. Mrs. Claughton thinks the hair was lightish\nbrown, and the shawl partly over the head, but does not remember distinctly,\nand has no impression of the rest of the dress : it was not grave-clothes.\nShe said, \"Follow me.\" Mrs. Claughton rose, took the candle, and\nfollowed her out of the room, across the passage, and into the drawing-\nroom. She has no recollection as to the opening of the doors. The house\nmaid next day declared that the drawing-room door had been locked by her.\nOn entering the drawing-room, Mrs. Claughton, finding the candle on the\npoint of extinction, replaced it with a pink one from the cheffonier near the\ndoor. The figure went nearly to the end of the room, turned three-quarters\nround, said \"to-morrow,\" and disappeared. Mrs. Claughton returned to\nthe bedroom, where she found the elder child (not the one in the bed)\nsitting up. It asked, \" Who is the lady in white 1 \" Mrs. Claughton thinks\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 551\nshe answered the child, \" It's only me\u2014 mother ; go to sleep,\" or the like\nwords, and hushed her to sleep in her arms. The baby remained fast asleep.\nShe lit the gas and remained awake for some two hours, then put out the\nlights and went to sleep. Had no fear while seeing the figure, but was upset\nafter seeing it. Would not be prepared to swear that she might not have\nwalked in her sleep. Pink candle, partly burnt, in her room in morning.\nDoes not know if she took it burnt or new.\nIn the morning she spoke to Mr. Buckley, on whose advice she went to\nask Dr. Ferrier as to the figure about 3 p.m. He and his wife said the\ndescription was like that of Mrs. Blackburn, whom Mrs. Claughton already\nsuspected it to be. Thinks Dr. Ferrier told her that Miss Blackburn (Mrs.\nAppleby) had seen her mother in the same house. Mrs. Claughton cannot\nrecognise the photograph of Mrs. Blackburn shewn to her by Mr. Y. (who\ngot it from Mrs. M.) She says the figure seemed smaller, and the features\nmuch more pinched and attenuated, like those of a person in the last stage\nof consumption, which was also the general appearance. By his advice, Mr.\nBuckley put an electric bell under Mrs. Claughton's pillow, communicating\nwith Miss Buckley's room, as Mrs. Claughton determined to sit up that\nnight and watch.\nThat night Mrs. Claughton sat up dressed, with the gas burning. About\n12 she partly undressed, put on dressing-gown and lay down outside bed,\ngas still burning, and fell asleep reading. Woke up and found the same\nwoman as before, but the expression even more agitated. She bent over\n.Jlrs. Claughton and said : \"I have come. Listen 1\" She then made a\ncertain statement and asked Mrs. Claughton to do certain things. Mrs.\nClaughton said : \" Am I dreaming, or is it true ? \" The figure said some\nthing like : \" Tf you doubt me, you will find that the date of my marriage\nwas + + + \" (this is the date of the marriage, which took place in India,\nof Mrs. Blackburn to Mr. Blackburn, who is alive and married again. Mrs.\nClaughton first learned the corroboration of the date from Dr. Ferrier on\nthe following Thursday). After this Mrs. Claughton saw a man standing on\nMrs. B. 's left hand\u2014tall, dark, well-made, healthy, sixty years old, or more,\nordinary man's day clothes, kind, good expression. A conversation ensued\nbetween the three, in course of which the man stated himself to be George\nHoward, buried in Meresby Churchyard (Mrs. Claughton had never heard\nof Meresby or of George Howard), and gave the dates of his marriage + + +\nand death + + + [Entries of these dates seen by me in Mrs. Claughton's\npocket-book, as torn out and lent to me.\u2014F. W. H. M.] He desired\nMrs. Claughton to go to Meresby and verify these dates in the registers,\nand, if found correct, to go to the church at the ensuing 1.15 a.m.\nand wait at the grave therein (S.W. corner of S. aisle) of Richard\nHart, died + + +, ffitat +. She was to verify this reference also\nin the registers. He said her railway-ticket would not be taken, and she\nwas to send it along with a white rose from his grave to Dr. Ferrier.\nForbade her having any previous communication with the place, or going in\nher own name. Said Joseph Wright, a dark man, to whom she should\ndescribe him, would help her. That she would lodge with a woman who\nwould tell her that she had a child (drowned) buried in the same churchyard.\nWhen Mrs. Claughton had done all this, she should hear the rest of the\n\f552 F. W. H. Myers.\nhistory. Towards the end of the conversation, Mrs. Claughton saw a third\nphantom, of a man whose name she is not free to give, in great trouble,\nstanding, with hands on face (which he afterwards lowered, showing face),\nbehind Mrs. Blackburn's right. The three disappeared. Mrs. Claughton\nrose and went to the door to look out at the clock, but was seized with faint-\nness, returned and rang the electric bell. Mr. Buckley found her on the\nground. She was able to ask the time, which was about 1.20. Then\nfainted, and the Buckleys undressed her and put her to bed.\nThat morning, Tuesday, Mrs. Claughton sent for Dr. Ferrier, who\ncorroborated certain matters so far as she asked him, and ascertained for her '\nthe date of Mrs. Blackburn's marriage (she received his note of the date on\nThursday). She went to the Post Office, and found that \" Moresby \"\nexisted. Returned, and ascertained that it is in Suffolk, and so wrote that\nevening to Dr. Ferrier, and went to London with her daughters that\n(Thursday) evening.\nFriday night, Mrs. Claughton dreamt that she arrived at 5 after dusk,\nthat a fair was going on, and that she hud to go to place after place to get\nlodgings. Also, she and her eldest daughter dreamt that she would fail if\nshe did not go alone. Went to station for 12 noon train on Saturday. Went\nto refreshment room for luncheon, telling porter to call her in time. He\nwent by mistake to waiting room, and she missed train and had to wait (going\nto the British Museum, where she wrote her name in Jewel Room) until\n3.5, as stated. [Hours of trains slightly altered. \u2014F. W. H. M.] House\nwhere she finally found lodgings that of Joseph Wright, who turned ii\nout to be the Parish Clerk. She sent for the curate by porter, to ask\nas to consulting registers, but as he was dining out he did not come\ntill after she had gone to bed. Sunday morning, Mrs. Wright spoke\nto her about her drowned child buried in the churchyard. Went to fore\nnoon service, and immediately afterwards went into vestry and verified the\nregisters ; described George Howard to Joseph Wright, who had known him\nand recognised description ; then was taken by Joseph Wright to the graves\nof Richard Hart and George Howard. On the latter there is no stone, but\nthree mounds surrounded by a railing overgrown with white roses. She\ngathered rose for Dr. Ferrier, as had been directed. Walk and talk with\ncurate, who was not sympathetic. After luncheon went with Mrs. Wright\nand walked round Howard's house (country house in park). Attended\nevening service, and afterwards, while watching the lights put out and the\nchurch furniture covered up, wondered if she would have nerve to go on.\nBack to supper ; afterwards slept and had dream of a terrorizing character,\nwhereof has full written description. Dark night, hardly any moon, a few\nstars. To church with Joseph Wright at 1 a.m., with whom searched\ninterior and found it empty. At 1.20 was locked in alone, having no light ;\nhad been told to take Bible, but had only Church-service, which she had left\nin vestry in the morning. Waited near grave of Richard Hart. Felt no\nfear. Received communication, but does not feel free to give any detail.\nNo light. History begun at Blake Street then completed. Was directed to\ntake another white rose from George Howard's grave, and give it personally\nto his daughter (unmarried\u2014living at Hart Hall), and to remark her likeness\nto him.

The proceedings of the ghost, it\nwill be remarked, are vienx jen, and such as we seldom meet in modern\nscience. The tale was told to me orally, last night (October 16th) by a\ngentleman whom I shall call Dr. Ferrier. He is connected, as trustee, with\nthe haunted house. To-day he brought me his narrative written out partly\n\f554 F. W. H. Myers.\nby himself, partly by Mrs. Ferrier, and he added some facts vird voce. Here\nbegins his M.S. with all names altered. A. L.\nStatement by Dr. Ferrier.\nMrs. Elizabeth Blackburn died at 5 a.m., on December 22nd, 1878, in 6,\nBlake-street, into which she had moved only a few days previously. Her\ndisease was chronic diarrhoea of long standing. Her children stayed on in\nthe house till the eldest girl married Mr. Appleby in 1880. The eldest son\ninformed me that they frequently heard strange noises in the house during\nthe night. The house was empty for a time, then tenanted for five years,\nduring which no noises are reported. The house again was empty till Lady\nDay, 1888, when the present occupier, Mr. Buckley, entered. His mother\nand two sisters, on their entry, were much alarmed by sounds as if of heavy\nsteps on the stair-case, which is of stone. This lasted for three years, but\nwas never heard by Mr. Buckley. A few months after the family entered\nwater burst out in the front area, from the breaking of a water main.1\nAbout two years after the affair of the main, Miss Buckley was in the attic,\nkneeling by a trunk, when she felt some water \" switched \" at her. She\nthought it was a practical joke of her brother's, but he was not in the room.\nA small pool of water was on the floor where she stood, and the wall beyond\nwas sprinkled. Soon after, as Mr. Buckley went upstairs in the dark, carry\ning an ink bottle and some pens, he found his hand wet. He thought it\nmust be ink, but on getting to the light found it was clean water ; there wa\u00ab\na little pool of water on the stair where this occurred, but no sign of damp\non the ceiling above.\nFor almost two years since this occurred no noises have been heard.\nIn October, 1893, a Mrs. Claughton came to stay in the house. She had\nfrequently been a visitor, and, on one occasion, when nursing Mrs. Buckley\n(mere), had heard footsteps coming and going on the stairs. In this last visit\n(October, 1893) she began to hear footsteps and the dragging of a heavy\nweight on the stairs about 1a.m. [October 8th. No footsteps or anything\npeculiar was heard till the Sunday night. Mrs. Claughton went to stay in\nthe house the previous Tuesday.] She was awakened by a chill wind blowing\nacross her face, though window and door were shut, and it was a calm still\nnight. On the night of October 8th and 9th, after hearing the noises and\nfeeling the wind, she opened her eyes, and saw leaning over her the figure of\na woman, who was looking at her intently and very sadly.2 The woman said\nin a distinct voice, \"follow me,\" whereon Mrs. Claughton rose and followed\nher into the next room, the drawing-room.3 She took her bed-room candle\nwhich was flickering in the socket, and, in the drawing-room, paused to\nreplace it by a pink candle from a table. She then saw that the figure\nhad reached the further end of the drawing-room ; the figure turned her\n1 Water is only carried up to the first floor. There ia an unused system of hot air\npipes. The sounds lasted after the main was mended. [Note by A. L.]\n- Mrs Claughton describes the appearance as very emaciated, sad and kindly of\nexpression, the head swathed in a ramchudder shawl. [Note by A. L.]\n8 Mrs. C. 's account ofthis is that the figure passed through the locked door. How\nshe entered herself she does not recollect. [Note by A. L.]\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 555\nhead, said, in a distinct voice, \" to-morrow,\" and vanished. Mrs. Claughton\nreturned to her room, and heard no more that night.l\nThe woman came to her bedside on the following night, and, after making\nher take most solemn oaths of secrecy, [made her a certain communication,\nand asked her to do certain things.] Mrs. C. was to go to a place of which\nshe had never heard, to a house and a man whom the figure described. This\nman would help her in what she had to do, including a nocturnal visit to a\nchurch where she would receive some information.\nThe Buckleys were wakened by the alarum wildly pealed, and found Mrs.\nClaughton in a swoon on her bed. [Mrs. Claughton said she had been asked\nto go to a place, the name of which she had never before heard.] Dr. Ferrier\nrecommended her to consult a postal guide for the name of the place which\nshe did not communicate to him. She did, however, ask Mr. Buckley if he\nhad ever heard of such a place as Meresby (not the real name), and it is as\nobscure as a village can be, and within four to five hours of London.\nMrs. Claughton left the town where these events occurred on October\n11th for London, meaning to visit Meresby as soon as possible. Here my\ninformation ceases, except that her governess in town (after her arrival\nthere), was disturbed all night by moans, laments, and sounds as of an\nelectric machine out of order (October 13th). Mrs. C. had asked Dr. Ferrier\nfor the [date] of Mrs. Blackburn's marriage. He sent her a note from Mrs.\nAppleby, giving place and date.\nMrs. Claughton at once showed Mr. Buckley and Dr. Ferrier that date\nnoted in her diary.\nIn a later letter, dated October 26th, 1893, Mr. Lang writes :\u2014\nThere is now no doubt that Mrs. Claughton did all she says. She went,\non October 14th, to a very remote small place. The parish clerk there and\nthe curate (the rector being off duty from age), corroborate things in written\nstatements.2 She says she reached the place I call \" Meresby \" in the\nevening, went to the clerk named by ghost, and asked for parish registers.\nShe saw these on Sunday (October 15th) after Matins. There she found\nentries (she says) corresponding with those given by ghosts. The curate, of\ncourse, can only say she searched for those names, which I need not give.\nShe expressed satisfaction. She passed some time in the church at 1\u20142\na.m. (after midnight), the clerk remaining outside. She then emerges, all\nhappened as she expected. She asked the clerk to take her to the grave of\n[George Howard,] one of the parties in the register; he died in the same year\n' as ghost ( Mrs. Blackburn). [It was the grave where she went after church in\nthe morning. It was too dark for her to find her way without the clerk's\nguidance.] There she plucked a white rose and went back to bed.\nSo far clerk and curate.\n[Mrs. Claughton has said to no one what happened in the church.] Here\ncomes a curious thing. Originally she said (Dr. Ferrier remembers it) that\nshe saw more than one phantasm, [three persons] on the second night, October\n1 On the following morning she consulted Dr. Ferrier. He advised her to change\nher room, which she disdained as cowardly. He suggested fixing up an electric alarm\nin her room, which was done. [Note by A. L. ]\n2 1 have seen curate's and clerk's reports. [Note by A. L. ]\n\f556 F. W. H. Myers.\n9th, when she rang the alarum. One of these was owner of the said grave.\nThat ghost bade her go and see his daughter, [and that in her face she, Mrs.\nClaughton, would see the likeness to her father.] Mrs. Blackburn only sent\nvague messages of forgiveness, and it was site who insisted on the flower-\nplucking. On Monday, October 16th, Mrs. Claughton called on daughter of\nowner of grave (at Meresby), and gave the ghost's message. She lives some\nway outside of the little village. Mrs. Claughton describes this lady's father\n[to her, and the lady said the description was that of her father.] The clerk\ncorroborates fact of visit to the daughter. Mrs. Claughton returned to town\non the following day. [She travelled up in the same carriage as a lady and\ngentleman and a child, who she afterwards found had been staying at the\nRectory. The child was cold, and Mrs. Claughton lent her a jacket, and\nthen entered into conversation, they saying they had been staying at Meresby\nRectory.] Mrs. Claughton has no natural knowledge of the place or\nparties. [Mrs. Claughton feels relief that she has been able to carry out\nsatisfactorily what she had undertaken,] and is apparently convinced she saw\nphantasms [either in a dream or reality]. ^\nBy the way, spectres throwing water occur in some of your society's\nreports (Proceedings XIX. 189), and in old books. This occurred not to\nMrs. Claughton but to her friends, before her adventure.\nThe clerk of the parish of \" Meresby \" states that Mrs. Claughton\ncorrectly described one of their local ghosts as he was when alive, though\nnobody knows how she even knew of his existence. Neither thia latter\nghost nor Mrs. Blackburn seems to have been known to Mrs. Claughton.\n[Mrs. Claughton was in England in 1878, in the same place, as far as she can\nremember, as where Mrs. Blackburn died, only she did not know her.]\nCopiesfrom tombstones in Meresby Churchyard.\n(1) To teach self-sacrifice and simple faith this stone recalls the sweet\nmemory of Constance, the dearly-loved wife of Thomas Carden ; born\nMay 2nd, 1851 ; died, 17th January, 1891.\n\"And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\"\n(2) Richard Hart, Esq., 15th May, 1745, aged 67 years.\n(3) Marriage.

On Saturday evening, October 14th,\na lady who gave the name of Claughton, after going to several places for\nlodgings, came to my house, accompanied by porter with luggage. I accom\nmodated the lady with lodgings. She told me that she wanted to look at the\nchurch registers, and did I think the curate would come and speak to her at\nmy house. I told her I thought he would, as she would like to see them on\nSunday. The lady then sent note by porter to curate, who was just going\nout to dinner so did not come till about half-past eleven, when lady ha i\nretired to bed. He asked me to apologise to her for not coming before, but\nwould be happy for her to see registers on Sunday morning after service.\nThe lady came to morning service, and afterwards came to vestry and\nasked for registers of Richard Hart and George Howard, also giving descrip\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 557\ntion of George Howard, which was quite correct, and dates of registers also\ncorresponded with those in the lady's journal. I then showed her the tomb\nstone of Richard Hart, and also the grave of George Howard. Curate\nrefusing to assist lady any further, the lady asked me whether I would\naccompany her to the church at twenty minutes past one Monday morning.\nI told her I could not give a decided answer just then, but would do so after\nevening service. Spoke to curate upon the matter after service. He told me\nthat he should not have any more to do with it, but that I could do as I\nliked. I then told the lady I would do as requested. At a quarter to one\nt o'clock I called her. We then proceeded to the church, and after looking\nall around the interior, I left the lady in the church at twenty past one\no'clock in total darkness, locking the door on the outside. At twenty minutes\nto two o'clock, by the lady's request, I gave three slight taps on the door,\nunlocked it, when the lady came out. We then went to grave of George\nHoward, where the lady plucked some roses. We then returned, reaching\nhome at about two o'clock.\n(Signed) Joseph Wright,\nMoresby, October 22nd.

I saw the curate last evening. He showed me a letter\nthat came from a man by the name of Johnson, of Barton, asking for par\nticulars about you1, and also whether I took you to the church on Saturday\nnight or Sunday morning, he put it, but, unfortunately, this letter was sent\nto the vicarage, and, of course, the vicar was not supposed to know anything\nabout it. The curate seemed to be rather annoyed about it going there, as\nit was decided to keep it a secret. Hoping that you arrived home quite safe,\n\u2014I remain yours obediently, Joseph Wright,\nPariah Clerk.\nLetterfrom Mr. Buckley to Mrs. CUmghton.\nDear Mrs. Claughton,\u2014There was a ghost before you came to stay in\nthe house.

There\nwas a pool of water on the floor as well.\nMy sister was alarmed at this, as she knew no one was in the room or on\nthat story with her.

W- Buckley.\nStatement by Mrs. Claughton's governess.\nI was sitting at needlework in the schoolroom last night (Friday,\nOctober 13th,) at about 11 o'clock. Mrs. Claughton was in her room, the\ndoor shut, the servants all in bed. I heard some one crying or rather\nsobbing, very low but very distinctly, as if their heart would break. I\nimmediately thought of Hilda and went half way downstairs when I found\nher door wide open and all perfectly still. I returned to my work, the\nsobbing continued, like a woman's or a girl's voice. I thought it strange\nthat one could hear so distinctly through the walls, but determined it must\nbe from next door and thought no more about it.\nI was awakened from my first sleep by loud moans which seemed to fill\nthe room and come from every part. As soon as I was awake they ceased.\nOddly enough, I did not feel a bit frightened, but made up my mind that it\nwas a sudden gust of wind. I sat right up in bed and listened. All was\nperfectly still, till I heard a very odd sound overhead like some electric\nbattery gone wrong and broken. I thought of thieves, then remembered\nthat the telegraph wires are fixed to this house, but thought it odd I should\nhear them, having the nurseries over my room. I hesitated whether\nI should go round the house and see if all were well, but determined to\ngo to sleep again, as the sound was certainly not that of housebreakers.\nI also thought of a supernatural cause and could find none. I was\nwide awake and sitting up in bed when I heard this strange sound, and\nnot being able to account for it satisfactorily, lay back and went to\nsleep again. All was so perfectly still in the street and everywhere I\nshould imagine it must have been between the hours of one and two.\nI slept soundly and was awakened at least three times more always with\nthese fearful moans, which filled the room, always feeling wide awake\nand each time attributing it to the wind, although when one awoke the\nsounds ceased and there was not a breath of wind to be heard. Towards\nmorning 1 distinctly heard a very, very heavy footstep overhead and\na heavy thud as of somebody moving something very cumbersome and\nheavy. I thought of Richardson and wondered if she had returned\nwithout any one knowing. As I knew the nurseries to be locked and the\nkeys (as I thSn thought) in her keeping, I sat up again and listened. All\nwas perfectly still. I knew I had not been dreaming, and yet could not\naccount for the noise, all being so perfectly still.\nI slept again and heard the servants going down, some hours later, and\nthought no more about my dreams until I saw Miss Claughton after break\nfast. Mrs. Claughton had talked of Spiritualism during breakfast, yet\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 559\nthis did not bring my night's experience to my memory. It only all came\nback link by link when I saw Miss Claughton and told her.\nSaturday, October Uth, 1893. (Signed) Mahib Giraud.\nThe third series of narratives suggesting an unseen protection or\nguidance comes from a witness of whose veracity and memory Mr.\nG. A. Smith, who interviewed him for Mr. Gurney in Florida as long\nago as November, 1886, formed a very high opinion (see Proceedings,\nVol. V., p. 325). Mr. Smith's account, and some other recommenda\ntions received of Mr. Skilton, led Mrs. Sidgwick to print some of his\nexperiences, (lac. cit.) Some subsequent correspondence has confirmed\nthe impression, and although the following incidents are remote and\nuncorroborated, I think that they should be printed here.\nWriting from Daytona, Florida, October 20, 1895, Mr. Skilton\ntells me that the statements sent to Professor James were \" written\ndown along as they occurred.\"\nP. 158.\nMr. Skilton, writing from Jacksonville, Florida, November 10th, 1890,\nsends to Professor James the following additional incidents \" noted down\nin my memorandum.\"\n1. In giving this incident of my life in which I was guided by some very\nmysterious influence beyond my control, I feel as though my life and\nacts had been of some good and benefit to my fellow man. Being sick with\nthe mumps for some time and severe, I was confined to my room about\nthree weeks, but one morning feeling able to go to the R.R. Depot, 1 started\nout ; my folks telling me I must not go away, as it was raining and bad\nweather. However, I went on to the depot and the first train that came\nin was a construction train out picking up iron and ties along the road, and\nI very strangely went off dead-head on the train for a distance of twenty\nmiles where they went on the side track to let the express pass them, as\nthey were nearly due, and a very fast train of about seven cars, and\ndid not make this a stopping place. As this working-train had backed\nin so as to clear the main track, and the switch set for the main track, the\nconductor told the forward breakman to go up to open the switch, meaning\nafter the express had passed ; he then went with the engineer to the\ncarboose car for some purpose, but the brakeman went direct to the switch\nand changed it to the side track, which of course the conductor nor engineer\nknew nothing about. Just about this time I heard the express coming, and\nsaw the switch wrong, and the brakeman standing at it. I tried every way\nin my power to get him to change it, but could not. I then started and ran\nto change it myself, but just before I got to it, I fell down by some means,\nbut got up again and changed the switch just as the engine of the express\nwas coming on to the rails, and saved the terrible collision.\nThe engineer on the express stopped his train, after running by some\ndistance, and, backing up, called on the conductor and engineer to know\nwhat that meant, but they, not having seen it, were in a puzzle to know\n2 r 2\n\f560 F. W. H. Myers.\nwhat was going on ; but after being told what had happened, the question,\ncame up, who changed the switch and saved the train ? I told them I did.\nThey then wanted to know what I was doing on that train. I told them\nI was a dead-head on it ; but for what purpose I did not know, as I ought\nnot to have come away from home that day, as I had been quite sick ; but\nI thought it was all right as I had done a good thing. The engineer on the\nexpress says, \"Yes, you have saved my life and many others,\" and then\nturning to conductor and engineer on the working train said, \" You had\nbetter keep a dead-head on your train all the time.\"\nNow for an explanation of what that brakeman thought he was doing\nwould puzzle the oldest heads that know anything about railroad manage\nment !\nI went home on that working train that night, and felt justified, though\nI had gone away without any purpose ; and many times since, in meeting\nthis engineer of the express, he would say, \" you are the man that saved\nmy life.\"\nThis happened before I had learned the art of railroading, but as for any\nremuneration or favour, I never received as much as a \" thank you \" from the\nR. R. Co. for what I did.\n2. I do not call this a premonition ; you can style it what you think\nproper.\nAs an introduction to it, I would say that I have been engaged a great\npart of my life as a locomotive engineer, and this happened while engaged in\nthat business. I was engaged with two other men one day about two\no'clock p.m. in taking out some evergreen trees from a box car to take home\nand set out ; they were large and heavy ; I had to run the car up on the\nswitch rails to get them out ; but as there was no train due till forty minutes\nI would have plenty of time to get them out, and push the car back out of\nthe way. There had been a great deal of other freight put in the car after\nmine was, so it was necessary to take out some of it before I could get at\nmine. I opened the car door, and a barrel of eggs fell out on the ground,\nand just at that instance I saw a medium-sized person standing at my right\nhand clothed in white with a bright countenance, beaming with intelligence.\nI knew what he wanted in an instant, although he put his hand on my\nshoulder and said, \" Come with me.\" We moved upward, and a little to the\nsouth-east with the speed of lightning, as it were ; I could see the hills,\ntrees, buildings and roads as we went up side by side till they vanished out\nof our sight. As we passed on, this glorious being that was with me told\nme he was going to show me that bright heavenly world. We soon came\nto a world of light and beauty, many thousand times larger than this earth,\nwith at least four times as much light. The beauties of this place were\nbeyond any human being to describe. I was seated by the tree of life on\na square bunch of what appeared to be a green velvet moss, about eighteen\ninches high ; there I saw many thousands spirits clothed in white, and\nsinging the heavenly songs, and I could think of but one verse that I had\never heard that would do justice to this heavenly music, and that is this,\n\" Hark what sweet music, what a song Sounds from the bright, celestial\nthrong ! \" for it was the sweetest song I have ever heard. I here told my\nattendant that it was the first time I had ever been perfectly at rest in my\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 561\nlife. They did not converse by sound, but each knew the other s thoughts at\nthe instant, and conversation was carried on in that way, and also with me.\nAfter viewing the wonderful beauties of the place for some time and the\nthousands of spirits, robed in spotless white, passing through the air, for\nthey did not confine themselves to the surface, but went every direction as\nthey pleased, I wanted to see my dear mother, two sisters, and a child of\nmine that had died some time before this. The request was granted at once,\nbut I was not allowed to converse with them. They were standing in a row\nin front of me, and I looked at them and coolly estimated the distance we\nwere apart at thirty feet, and wondered how these things could be. They\nseemed very much pleased to see me, and I shall never forget how they wel\ncomed me when I first saw them, although no conversation passed. About\nthis time my attendant told me we must go back ; I wished to stay, but he told\nme my time had not come yet, but would in due time, and that I should\nwait with patience. At this we started back, and were soon out of sight\nof that heavenly land. When we came in sight of this world, I saw every\nthing as it looked from a great height, such as trees, buildings, hills, roads,\nand streams, as natural as could be, till we came to the car that I had\nopened the door, and I found myself there in the body, and he vanished\nout of my sight. I spoke then (just as I opened my watch and found it\nhad been just twenty-six minutes that I had been engaged with that\nmysterious one), and said I thought I had left this world for good. One of\nthe men said, \" There is something the matter with you ever since you opened\nthe car door ; we have not been able to get a word out of you,\" and that I\nhad done all the work of taking out everything and putting it back into the\ncar, and one item was eight barrels of flour I had taken off the ground alone\nand put them back in the car, three feet and a half high, with all the ease of\na giant. I told them where I had been and what I had seen, but they had\nBeen no one.\nThis I count the brightest day of my life, and what I saw is worth a life\ntime of hardship and toil. Being in good health, and in my right mind in\nmid-day, while busy about my work, and my mind not more than ordinarily\nengaged on the great subject of eternal life, I consider this a most extra\nordinary incident. I was told by this mysterious person that if we are\ncounted worthy at death, we shall be accompanied to that bright world by\none of those glorious beings, and this is my firm belief.\nA Dream.\n3. Being engaged running a locomotive with a local freight train for some\ntime, and there were several working or construction trains on the same\nroad, and one in particular that was very difficult to run and not get in the\nway of other working trains, which offence would suspend the conductor\nand engineer, or one of them at least ; and what made it still more com\nplicated was that they had to run over several miles of another road where\nthere were many more trains to look after, as both roads ran over the\nsame track. After trying three or four conductors and engineers and all got\ndischarged or suspended for thirty or sixty days, the road master came to\nme to take the engine I was running, and go and try it without a conductor,\nand have charge of a large number of men as gang boss, working the men,\nkeeping their time mileage of the cars loaded and light, conducting the\n\f562 F. W. H. Myers.\ntrain, running the engine, and receiving all telegraph orders, making a\nreport each day of all I had done, and all that transpired\u2014being stationed\nout on the road at a small town.\nAfter running it about two weeks, I dreamed one night that there was\na collision at that station of the fast express with the through freight train,\nand that the engines were terribly broken up and passenger coaches, with\nmany killed and many more badly hurt. When I awoke, it was very vivid\nin my mind, worried me throughout the day, but nothing happened ; but\nthe next morning when I was ready to go, the through freight train was\nlate, and came down, passing the station seven minutes on the express time\n(one of the most reckless things they could have done, as it was in a cut,\nand on a sharp curve where the express always came through at full speed).\nMy engine was standing over on the second side track with its train. Just\nthen I heard the express whistle for the station, \u2014 I saw my dream in an\ninstant, with all its horror, but, not supposing there was any chance to save\nthem, I took a red flag and ran out on the track and stopped the freight by\nmy signals, as I ran down the track towards the express, as it was in the\ncurve. As soon as the engineer saw the flag, he did all in his power to stop.\nThe two engines came within about ten feet of each other, as they stopped.\nNow without any one to have flagged them, there is no telling what\nthe result would have been, as there were nine coaches, with all that could\nstand up inside and out on the platforms, and no one else that could have\nflagged the trains, as they were not there to do it if I had not done it. The\ndream had aroused my mind so thoroughly that I was on the look out for\nanything of the kind to happen ; otherwise I should not have paid any\nattention to them, as I was not in the habit of meddling with other trains\nwhen mine was out of the way. This was looked at by those interested\nthere at that time as a matter of chance, or luck, as some would have it\u2014just\nhappened to be so, but if they [had] known what I did about it and had their\nmind taxed as heavily as I did the day before, they would have thought\ndifferent ; for I practically knew of it more than twenty-four hours before it\ncame, and had it in my power to save it, and did it with joy.\nI attribute this to the power of an unseen agent that worked upon my\nmind so effectually as to entirely avoid the terrible accident that might have\nSent many to their long home.\nHow I Saved a Dreadful Collision.\n4. I was once engaged as engineer on a fast express, and it became\nnecessary to change the time card on the R. R., as they put on another\nexpress train which was to meet the train I ran at the point I took it, and in\nchanging the time they changed some of the most important rules in running\nthe road, and not making them quite as explicit as they should. When the\nfirst day came for us to meet there, the new traindid not come. After wait\ning the usual time for the variation for watches, the conductor gave the signal\nto go, but I shook my head. He stepped into the office and reported me to\nthe superintendent (who was there) immediately, saying he would not have\nan engineer that would not go when he told him to. The superintendent\ncame out and asked what was the matter. I said he had no right to go\naccording to the time-card, but he called me into the office with several\nother men, who all said I was wrong. The superintendent said he had made\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 563\nthe time-card and knew his business. But after parleying fifteen minutes,\nand getting myself in a position to be discharged promptly, and all parties\nbeing in a bad humour, I asked the superintendent to read over the rules that\nrelated to meeting station, which he promptly said he would do, and show\nme where I stood. He picked up a new time-card and began reading the\nrules, but not coming to the one he wanted to, he was some time in getting\nto it, and just using up the time, as I wanted him to, and before he got\nquite to the rule he wanted to show me, I heard the familiar whistle of\nthe fast train up the grade about a mile. I tapped him on the shoulder\n' with my hand and said, \"That settles it.\" I ran out and just succeeded in\nbacking my train down the grade out of the way. I then went to the\nsuperintendent and asked him what he thought about the time-card. He\nsaid, \" You have saved us one of the greatest collisions that was ever had on\na R. R.\" He says, \"I can't see how you could see anything in the time-card\nthat would hold you so against such odds and men of experience, as to\nutterly refuse to go out.\" I told him the time-card was not very plain, and\nwould not have kept me from obeying orders. \" My will was to do just\nwhat you wanted, but there was a very strong impression on my mind that\nthere was wrong in starting, which grew intense as the conductor gave the\nsignal ; it appeared to reach a point just at that time that it would have been\nimpossible to have got me to go.\" Although I was cool and quiet in the\nmidst of derision, I had faith to believe that my impression, come from\nwhat source it would, was able to carry me through, and I determined to\nj follow it at all hazards, and it brought me out in triumph.\nThe superintendent then said, \" For this act, I will never find fault with\nyou hereafter,\"\u2014and he never did. The conductor that evening said, \"You\nare worthy of a pension, I will never dispute you on the rights of trains\nagain. \"\nNow this kind of a glorious informant, or a sure knowing of things not\nyet happened, has been with me all of my railroad life, and has never\nfailed me in any instance, but has saved my life many times.\n5. I was once firing a locomotive that was hauling iron over another road to\nlay its track of. It was a fine new passenger engine, with large driving wheels\nfor making fast time, just from the builder's shop, and I thought I had been\nvery lucky to get so good a situation as to be fireman on so good a locomotive.\nTwo nights before leaving with the train, I dreamed that the engine and\ntrain ran through the shallow cut, and came out on the top of a stone bridge\nvery high, ran across the bridge and turned over down the bank some\nseventy feet into the river. I was stopping with a very intelligent Christian\nfamily, and I told my dream to the lady of the house. She appeared to be\nvery deeply interested in it, and told me I was going to get killed. I told\nher I had an assurance in my dream that I would not get hurt, that I\nhad great faith in. She tried to persuade me not to go out at all with\nthe train, but I did not heed her warning, and when the time came\nto go out with the train, I went. When we had got about fourteen miles\nout, and were running pretty fast down grade through a shallow cut,\nI all at once saw a large number of men on the track which the engineer\ncould not see, as he was near-sighted, but I told him to stop as soon as\npossible, but we soon got so near as to see that the men had taken up\n\f564 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe track and rolled out the large timbers that lay from the stone bridge\noff on the high embankment, making a kind of ditch over two feet deep and\nfifty feet long. But, as it happened, they had got but one of the timbers\nout on one side which made it still worse for turning over the engine.\nThe engineer set about stopping the train with all his might, but to no\npurpose, as the track was wet, and he soon jumped off and left the engine.\nI thought it could be stopped and saved, and I stayed on and reversed the\nengine, and put on all the steam and whistle brakes. By this time I was on\nthe bridge, and no chance to get off. I failed to stop the engine, and it ran\ninto the place dug out, just off the end of the bridge, and turned over on\nthe heavy wall laid up to keep the embankment from washing away. As it\nwas a long way down, it had to make two complete turns to reach the\nbottom. The first time it went over, it blew off the top of the boiler, with\na tremendous explosion. As the wall was as steep as a Gothic roof, I had\nmore than I could do to keep my feet in going down through with the engine,\ntender, and wood jack screws, pinch bars, and tools, all after me, and\nalmost on me. The bottom of the river was a solid rock with six inches of\nwater on it. I got through with but one small scratch.\nI went up and measured the bridge, and found it two hundred feet long,\nwith five arches in it, made of cut stone, and fifty-four feet perpendicular,\nand seventy feet on the slope, where the engine rolled down.\nAs soon as I got up out of the river, I looked back, and saw my dream,\njust as it looked to me when I was dreaming.\nNot being familiar with the road, I could not locate any such a place,\nbut when I came to try the realities of it, I saw the place just as I dreamed\nit, and every part of this dream came true, just as I saw it.\nI went back to my boarding place the same evening, and told the land\nlady that the locomotive had turned over into the river, and was nearly\ndestroyed, but that I was all right.\nThis was my first dream of this kind, which was afterwards repeated four\ntimes more in different places and circumstances, and came out just the same;\nso that I had a knowledge of two days ahead of just what was going to\nhappen each time, by some mysterious agency or guardian spirit. It is my\ncandid belief that this guardian continued with me day and night as long as\nI ran a locomotive, always directing me in the right, where it would have\nbeen possible for me to have done wrong; and where others did wrong and I\nwould suffer by it, I escaped in every instance. In this case, if the flagman\nhad put out his flag before taking up the track, all would have been well.\n6. I give this narrative of my life from an actual occurrence, to show that\nthere is in many cases an unseen agency governing the mind, actions,\nand labours of some, to their own great advantage, and safety of others.\nI was running an engine on a fast night train ; I had been running the\nsame train about five years ; at one point on the road there was an outer\nswitch that we passed after whistling for the station at full speed. I don't\nremember in all that time of slowing up the train in the least, for it, this\nsiding, was used for broken cars and stock cars out of season for using them,\nand usually had from fifteen to thirty cars on it ; at the time I relate, it had\ntwenty-six cars on it. We usually passed it at a speed of fifty miles an hour,\nand sometimes more than that, although we always stopped at the station,\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 565\nwhich was a half mile further on. I never felt any fear as to its safety, but\none night, leaving home, the thought came to my mind that that switch was\nwrong, but I tried to put it off and not think of it, but it disturbed me\nconsiderable.\nWhen the train came for me to take, it was fifty minutes late, and no\ntime to lose for anything along the road. I started, willing to make up all\nthe time I could over my part of the route. But this switch bore heavily on\nmy mind as being wrong, and the nearer I got to it, the stronger the\nimpression, till at last I made up my mind that it would not break up the\nf R. R. Co. to stop and see. I whistled for the station and put on the breaks,\nand stopped the train and as the head light gave a good light for some yards\nahead, I could distinctly see the switch wrong ; I got off and went ahead to\nchange it and found it locked. Just then the conductor had got off the train,\nand wanted to know what I had stopped there for ; I told him I thought I\nwould shut up that switch before I ran over it. He says, \"How did you\nknow it was wrong ? \" I said I did not know it, but have had it on my mind\nall night so far that it was wrong, and thought I would stop and see, to\nsatisfy my curiosity. He said, \" You have done a good thing\u2014saved your\nlife and all the rest of us, besides the engine and train.\"\nNow this circumstance has given me great satisfaction to look back to\nand see how wonderfully my mind was wrought upon by some unseen\nagency that would not let me shake off the impression, but kept enforcing\nit more and more. From this may we not make up our minds that we are\n^many times saved from a dreadful fate or accident ? Such has been my\nexperience many, very many times.\n7. In September, 1859, being an engineer running a fast train on a through\nwestern road, and being at the west end of my route on Saturday night,\nSeptember 3rd, where I arrived about twelve at night ; on retiring I had a\nvery interesting dream, and as I had had two before of the same kind at\ndifferent places which came true to the letter, it made this all the more\ninteresting to me. I dreamed that 1 was running this fast train going west,\nand that it was nearly an hour late, and I was trying to make up all the\ntime I could, and just as I was about half way between two stations,\nwhich were eight miles apart and on the smoothest track on the whole road,\nthe engine ran off on the north side of the track, and turned over in the\nnight, and when it stopped I was sitting on one of the driving wheels with\nmy feet down between the spokes, and in the darkness a person of medium\n'- stature, dressed in white, came down from heaven, a little from a south-east\ndirection, not straight down, with a span of white horses and a black\ncarriage, and took me off the driving wheel of the locomotive as it lay\non its side, and put me in the carriage, and went up a little south-\neasternly from straight up ; this was the end of the dream ; but I awakened\nand it worked my mind very much, so that I slept but little more that\nnight, and during the Sabbath my mind was wonderfully worked upon to\nknow what this meant ; for I had faith to believe it would come to pass.\nI told no one, but it worried me very much. On Monday morning,\nSeptember 5th, I took the fast express back to the other end of my route\nwhere I lived, and where I arrived about 1 p.m. At 9.40 my time came\nto go west again at night. The train was fifty-four minutes late. As usual\n\f566 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe conductor said, \"Make up all you can,\" which was equivalent to\nsaying, \" run as fast as you dare ride. \" I left with all speed, and had not\ntold my wife or family of my dream. When about forty miles out, and\nmaking about as fast time as I ever ran, which was some more than a\nmile a minute, and just at the place of running off in my dream, the engine\nstruck a horse which went under and threw off the forward trucks, which\nvery soon resulted in turning over the engine in the very place I had\ndreamed. Its speed was so great, and on level ground, that it slid over\nfifty feet after it lay on its side. It being one of the darkest nights 1 ever\nsaw, about 11 p.m., it was impossible to do anything. However, I reversed %\nthe engine the moment it left the track, but did not shut off steam. It\nturned over, and when it fetched up and stopped, I found myself sitting on\nthe driving wheel, with my feet down through between the spokes, with my\nunder jaw broken, and three ribs on my left side, and quite a deep gash\ncut on both sides of my face, with the throttle lever broken off eighteen\ninches long, and in my hand, which I had not let goof all the time. But the\nperson dressed in white with a shining countenance beaming with intelli\ngence, I did not see, nor the white horses and black carriage.\nIt was telegraphed to my wife that I was killed, but she would not\nbelieve it.\nI got home the next day at five o'clock in the evening, fully believing\nthere was something in some dreams.\nNow it seems more of a mystery to me that this dream should come true\nto the letter till it came down to the very point where I should see the man y\nin white, with carriage and horses, and have that part left out, than it does\nto have the other part come as dreamed.\nMy mind was so much disturbed by my dream at one time Monday,\nthat I made up my mind not to go out that night, but let some one else try\nit ; but I had no sooner got my mind made up than it was changed by some\nunseen agency, and an assurance given that I had not the least doubt in\nthat I should not be killed or very badly hurt. The all absorbing thought\ncame to my mind that all I needed was faith unwavering, and it came to my\nmind in great strength. I used to at all times, when starting out with my\nengine, commit my life and all into the hands of Him who doeth all things\nwell, nothing doubting, and He never failed me in the greatest hour of need\nand accident many times.\n8. Being once placed in such a position that I would have been cut in\ntwo by a passing train, I will relate how wonderfully I was saved. It\nwas in this way : I was running an express train as engineer, and it was\ncustomary to do a considerable switching of freight cars at each end of the\nroute. As I was at the west end of my run, and had been switching cars\ntill the express was nearly due, and the local freight was just coming in\nthen from the way the express was due, I had a few moments of time,\nand was packing one of the pumps on the locomotive. I was not quite done\nwhen I ran down the track a little to tell the conductor, who was on the\npassenger coach of the freight train, that I wanted to get by him when he\nbacked in on the cross-over track, as it was called, and he said he would let\nme by with my engine. I then asked him what passenger car he had on\nbehind which was just next to the one I stood on. He said it was a six\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 567\nfoot gauge car on our tracks of four foot ten inch gauge. I was going to get\noff his car, just where I was packing the pump, and finish it as soon as\npossible, and run up and get by his train, as my train was about due then.\nAs I rode along up to my engine and was about ready to step off at the very\nplace I wanted to, I looked up and saw about thirty feet high a very\nsingular looking person clothed in white, with a wonderful bright countenance\nbeaming with intelligence passing along in the air, just so that if I got off\nthe car where I intended to I could not see it. I became wonderfully\ninterested, and rode on about forty feet farther, and it went out of my\n' sight in an instant. I got off the train just then which was moving along\nsome faster than a man could walk, but as soon as I struck the ground,\nI saw the situation in an instant. The broad gauge car was passing my\nengine then (which had an outside frame) with a clearance of only one and\na half inches, which would have rolled me in and cut me in two without the\nleast chance to have got away, as I did not see the danger till it was past\u2014\nif I had not seen this person passing along up in the air. It was wonderful\nwith what force this was pointed out to my mind as soon as I got on the\nground, and if I was ever thankful for anything in my life, I was much\nmore for this, knowing my life had been saved by some mysterious agent in\nsuch a wonderful interesting way.\nT told one of my railroad friends about it, and he said it was imagination.\nI told him it was a glorious imagination that would save a man's life that\nway, but that I thought I would be dishonest with myself and more so with\njay deliverer to attribute it to imagination.\nI made a memorandum of it, and said no more about it, feeling it was\nwrong to trifle with such glorious preservation of life by the Providence of\nGod.\nThis has occurred four times with me, saving my life in my railroad\nlife, but at no other time was there any one visible, but their influence\nwas powerful. Let the reader judge for himself the source of this, after\ngiving me credit of telling the simple truth just as it happened with me.\nIt has always been a satisfaction to me to think of this escape, and how\nnicely it turned out.\nMy railroading was all done in Ohio and Indiana.\nSubliminal inference may have operated in some of these cases ;\u2014\nas, for instance, when Mr. Skilton knew that a six-foot gauge car was\non the narrower track.\nNot the least remarkable of these incidents is the condition of\necstacy into which Mr. Skilton describes himself as falling during\nvigorous manual exercise. He writes to me that he has never had\nany trance save this ;\u2014which he regards as \" worth a lifetime of\nhardship and toil.\"\nAs I have elsewhere said, I incline to believe that ecstesy is the\nhighest condition into which a spirit still incarnate can pass. The\nso-called ecstasy of hysteria I regard as merely an instance of the\nimperfect simulations of various psychical states which the disinte\ngrated personality of the hysteric readily affords. True ecstasy I\n\f568 F. W. U. Myers.\nregard as a condition where the centre of consciousness changes from\nthe supraliminal to the subliminal self, and realises the transcendental\nenvironment in place of the material. The reminiscence of such a\nmomentary enlightenment I regard as inevitably confused and coloured\nby pre-existing supraliminal notions. I no more accept Mr. Skilton's\npicture of the unseen world as exact than I accept Swedenborg's ;\nbut I incline to believe that both alike were in truth exalted\ninto an \" interior condition \" where their perception of the Cosmos,\nthough less distinct and intelligible, was wider and profounder than\nour own.\nIn my next case it seems impossible even to suggest any finite mind\nas the source of intelligence.\nP. 144. Dream.\nReceived through the Rev. 0. H. Cope, from Miss I. Young. The\naccount was written in the early part of 1892.\nBritish Institute, 26, Rue de Vienne, Brussels.\nIn the morning of Friday, March 29th, 1889, after being awakened at my\nusual hour for rising, I went to sleep again, and dreamt the following :\u2014 I\nwas staying with & friend, Mrs. O , and it was by the sea-side; the house\noverlooked the sea, the waves nearly washing against the garden walI. Iti\nwas a bright clear day and I was standing close to the wall, watching in the\ndistance two vessels on the sea, one having left the place I was at, and the\nother advancing from the opposite shore. To my surprise I saw that neither\nvessel, as they neared each other, seemed to make room for the other, and\nthen to my horror one dashed into the other, cutting her in half. I saw the\nboiler burst of the injured vessel, throw up fragments and thick black smoke;\nI saw the passengers hurled into the water making frantic attempts to save\nthemselves. I especially noticed hats and other things floating on the water,\nand then suddenly two bodies were washed up at my feet, and I awoke and\nfound it was nearly 8.30 a.m. The dream made a vivid impression on me,\nand I could not shake off the feeling of horror I had experienced all through\nit. That saute afternoon news came from Ostend of a terrible catastrophe\nin the Channel, the two vessels, Princesses Henriette and Josephine,\ncrossing via Ostend and Dover, had come into collision that same morning )\nat 10 a.m.,1 the one had cut the other in half just as I had seen it in my\ndream ; indeed, the circumstances were the same. I knew no one on board,\nbut the lady with whom, in my dream, I was staying, had three relatives on\nboard ; one was drowned and the other two saved. Isarella Young.\nThe friend with whom Miss Young was staying at the time, Mrs. C. E.\nJenkins, writes :\u2014\nI certify that the above-mentioned dream was related to me about an\nhour after she had dreamt it, by Miss Young. jj q\u2022 Jenkins.\n1 Really later in the day, as steamers cross about midday.\u2014C.

G. Young related her dream to me\nabout the collision before we had heard anything of it, and that the news\ncame that afternoon. Meliora G. Jenkins.\n(Hon. Lady Superintendent,\nBritish Institute, Brussels.)\nWe give below some account of the events, as related in the Times.\nFrom the Times, March 30th, 1889 (Saturday) :\u2014\n\"A Channel Packet Missing.\n\" Up to 12 o'clock last night the mail and passenger steamer which left\nOstend for Dover at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, had not arrived. The\nvessel (the Comtesse de Flandre) was due at Dover at 2.30. There was a\nslight fog close in shore, but the Calais boat, which arrived last evening,\nreported that it was tolerably clear out in the Channel. Great anxiety was\nfelt at Dover last night as to the steamer's safety, and signal guns were fired\nat given intervals.\"\nIn the second edition of the Times, same date as above, the following\nappears :\u2014\n\" Foundering of an Ostend Mail Steamer (from Lloyd's).\n\" Lloyd's agent at Ostend telegraphs, under date to-day, 7.30 a.m., that\nthe mail boats the Princess Henriette, from Dover, and the Comtesse de\nFlandre, from Ostend, were in collision yesterday. The Comtesse de\nFlandre sank, and 11 of the crew, including captain and mate, and three\npassengers, were drowned. Mails lost.\n\"The Comtesse de Flandre was a steamer of 500 tons gross, and left\nOstend yesterday morning with mails and passengers for England.\"\nIn the Times, Monday, April 1st, 1889, a fuller account appears, with\nnames of victims, narratives of survivors, &c. Mr. Algernon Osborn, one\nof the saved, gives the time of the collision as half-past one. The Times\naccount is as follows :\u2014\n\"Loss of a Mail Steamer.\n\" A collision of a terrible character occurred in the English Channel on\n, Friday afternoon between two of the regular steamers plying between Dover\nand Ostend. As was announced in the Times on Saturday morning, great\nanxiety was felt at Dover on Friday night when the packet, the Comtesse de\nFlandre, failed to arrive at her appointed time. The packet started from\nOstend at a quarter past 10 on Friday morning for Dover, with 20 passengers\nand 7 bags of mails. At mid-day the Princess Henriette, a larger and faster\nboat than the Comtesse de Flandre, left Dover for Ostend with 15 passengers\non board. The weather was thick at the time, but not so dense as to render\nnavigation very difficult had all possible precautions been taken. At about a\nquarter to 2 in the afternoon, the officers of the Comtesse de Flandre saw the\nPrincess Henriette looming through the mist, and before any effort could be\nmade to avert the impending disaster, the Princess Henriette crashed into\n\f570 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe Comtcsse de Flandre's port sponson, cutting clean through the paddle-\nbox into the engine-room. The fore part of the vessel broke right away and\nsank, tho boilers exploding directly after the collision. The whole affair was\nso terribly sudden that passengers and crew alike were struggling in the\nwater before they had realised fully what had occurred \"\nThe account proceeds to describe the steps taken by the Princess\nHenriette to save life by lowering boats. Four passengers, the captain, the\nmate, five stokers, three engineers, and one sailor, comprise the list of\nmissing.\nI\nIn the next case the time-relation of the vision to the actual facts\nis not quite clear ; but there is distinct premonition as to the meeting\nwith the shipwrecked crew.\nL. 943.\nThe following dream, which evidently made a great impression on the\ndreamer, shows a sufficient amount of correspondence with actual fact both\nin the time at which it occurred and in detail (black man, schooner in distress)\nto suggest that it was in some way caused by these facts\u2014and it adds interest\nto it that it led to the rescue of the distressed men. It is not quite clear how-\nmuch of Captain Scott's narrative was taken from contemporary notes, and\nprobably no further evidence could be obtained as to this now.\nDocument I. \u2014From Bishop Hale. \\\nThe colony of Western Australia (called at the time the Swan River\nSettlement) was founded in 1829. Captain Scott must have gone there very\nshortly after that period.\nIn the year 1848, I being then Archdeacon of Adelaide, went to Western\nAustralia in attendance upon the Bishop of Adelaide. Captain Scott showed\ngreat readiness to assist the Bishop, and both he and I received from him\nmany acts of kindness.\nHe, one day, told me about his dreams and the circumstances connected\ntherewith. He told it all with such animation and such varying expressions\nof face that he gave one the idea that the things he spoke of were passing\nvividly before his mind's eye as he described them.\n1 was, of course, greatly struck by the narrative and said I should like\nvery much indeed to have it in writing. He said at once that I should have J\nit ; he would have the copy of his log, which he had by him, transcribed for\nme. I received the M.S. a few days afterwards.\nHis last illness was a long and wearisome one, and the old man was\npleased when any friend would look in and sit with him for a time. I was\nthen Bishop of the Diocese, and I was aware that the clergyman of his parish\n(Fremantle), Mr. Bostock, was in the habit of sometimes taking his seat by\nthe old man's bedside, in addition to the performance of the usual devotional\nservices.\nI never had upon my own mind the slightest doubt about the truth of the\nnarrative, but I was quite aware that some persons to whom I might chance\nto show it might feel doubtful about it, and it occurred to me that Mr.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 571\nBostock's friendly visits to the old man afforded an excellent opportunity for\ngetting some declaration such as that which he did obtain.\nMarch 9lh, 1892. Mathew B. Hale (Bishop).\nDocument II. \u2014Captain Scott's Account.\n\"June 10th, 1825.\n\"On the night of the 7th of June I dreamed that I saw a schooner, and\napparently water-logged, with several men in her and a black man among\nthem. On the eighth I dreamed the same and got up and started the mate up\n: aloft. I stayed on deck until daylight. On the 9th the same dream occurred.\n-Got up and altered the ship's course, having passed between Guadeloupe and\nAntigua, the day previous, and at 8 p.m. heavy squalls with heavy thunder\nand lightning ; shortened sail. Daylight made all sail, fine pleasant weather.\nOn the 10th, at 8 o'clock, altered the ship's course from W.S. \\V. to S. W. two\npoints for the purpose of ascertaining the true position of the Bird Islands,\nor to see if these really existed (as on my chart it was marked doubtful).\nI was at this time very uneasy in my mind, supposing that something was\ngoing to happen to my ship. I had related my dream to my mate and\npassengers, Don Joseph Sevarra, John Poingestre and Wm. Richenburg,\nEsqrs., merchants at Carthagena, who wrote the circumstances to the\nHumane Society and to their house in London.\n\"On the morning of the 10th, at 9.3 a.m., we were all at breakfast, the\nofficer on deck called down the skylight and said that a squall was coming. I\nimmediately repaired on deck to take in the small sails. On looking astern\n^the ship where the squall was coming from, we saw a boat with a large flag\nflying on an oar, and a man standing up in the bow holding it. I immediately\nhove the ship to and took in all studding and small sails. My men that were\naloft furling royals said that they could see a number of men and that they\nthought it was a pirate. One of the men stated that was just the way that\nhe was taken the year previous in the same seas. My passengers and officers\nthen requested me to keep the ship away, which I did, they stating that if\nthey should turn out to be pirates, I should not recover my insurance for my\nship. I then kept her away under her reef'd sails and went down to\nbreakfast. After my entering my cabin, I felt very uneasy and returned to\nthe state room. Immediately my dream came forcibly in my mind. I then\nput two pistols and my cutlass by my side and went on deck, called all hands i\non deck, and again hove the ship to and desired Mr. Poingestre to take the\nwheel and steer the ship. I then ordered the first officer to lower his boat\ndown and go and see what the boat was. I then ordered the guns to be\nloaded, made sail, and made a tack towards the boats. On my coming up\nwith them, found that my mate had taken the captain and his men out of the\nboat and taken them into his, Captain Jellard's boat having a great quantity\nof water in, very nearly up to the thwarts, also a large shark, and had her\nin tow.\n\"After getting Captain Jellard on board, and his men, who were in a\nvery weak state, not able to speak with the exception of the black man ; from\nhim I got all the particulars, as follows : it appeared that they belonged to\nthe schooner James Hambleton, of Grenada, from America, bound to Grenada,\nand being short of water, having a very long passage through light winds,\nwere going on shore for water on the Island of Saints, it then being calm.\n\f572 F. W. H. Myers.\nAlter leaving their ship a light breeze sprang up and the schooner kept her\nground, but the boat pulling in a different direction and the current running\nso strong that the boat's crew became quite exhausted. That at daylight\nthey had the mortification of seeing the schooner inshore of them as far as\nthey could see from the boat, the boat still drifting further from land and\nship until they lost sight of her altogether. The following day they had a\nvery dreadful time of it ; it blew a heavy gale, with thunder and lightning ;\nthey had to make fast the oars, mast and sail to the painter of the boat, and\nlet the boat drift to break off the sea that was running. During all this time\nthey had no water or anything to eat. The following day was nearly calm,\nvery light winds and a hot scorching sun ; being in the latitude of 16o 21',\nlongitude 63o 14', their sufferings were very great all day. Both captain and\nmen tore their clothes off their backs and poured water on themselves to\nkeep them cool. On the morning that I discovered them the black man\nappealed to his God, saying, ' If God hear black man as well as white man,\npray send me fish or shark for massa to eat, no let him die. ' The all-merciful\nFather heard his prayers and sent him a large shark, which was lying in the\nboat on her being brought alongside, of which they had drunk the blood and\neaten part of the flesh. I immediately knocked in the head of a water\npuncheon and made them a warm bath and put them severally into it for the\npurpose of cooling them and getting some parts of their shirts off their skin\nwhich were sticking to their backs, their skin being all blistered with the sun\nand salt water. I gave them a little tea to moisten their mouths every few\nminutes, until some of them prayed for food and asked for some biscuit, and\ngave them rice water and barley water occasionally. After a good sleep\nCaptain Jellard sent for me below and wished to speak to me. On searching;\nhis pockets to see if the black man had told the truth about his ship, I found\nhis register and manifest of his cargo. This satisfied me all was correct, and\nthat they were not pirates. During our conversation I fyund that I had\nbeen in company with Captain Jellard in St. John's, Newfoundland, in the\nyear 1814, he then commanding a fine schooner called the Catch Me Who Can,\nbelonging to Spuryar and Co. , of Cool.\n\"In a few days they all came round. I gave them up to the British\nConsul at Carthagena and requested him to lose no time to send them on, as\nwe feared that something would be brought against the mate of the schooner,\nCaptain Jellard having all his papers with him. On my arrival in England,\nI found that Captain Jellard only arrived there three days previous to the\nexecution of his mate and remaining three men, they having been tried for\nmurdering their captain and the other three men. Had not the Consul sent\nthem over in the packet to Jamaica and requested the admiral to send them\nup to Grenada with all dispatch, these four poor souls would have lost then-\nlives innocently.

Inquiries have been made through Lloyd's\nShipping Agency and the Board of Trade, but no log dated as far back\nas 1825 can be produced\u2014it was not till 1854 that trading vessels were\ncompelled to render official log-books.\nMy next narrative is from Dr. Wiltse, personally known to\nDr. Hodgson and myself as a careful and conscientious witness.\nP. 151.\nA case of probable primary independent clairvoyance, by Dr. A. S. Wiltse,\nSkiddy, Kansas.\nIf such a phase of clairvoyance can- be found as, independent of\nconscious or unconscious suggestion, attains to a knowledge of the unknown,\nand this without the aid of a second person as the operator, who induces or\nproduces the hypnotic condition, I term this primary independent clairvoy\nance, but if to attain to the knowledge of the unknown, the aid of a second\nperson is required as hypnotiser, then it would be secondary independent\nclairvoyance.\nWith this explanation of my terms, I respectfully submit my nomen\nclature to the judgment of your learned society, and proceed to recite for\nthe benefit of the society the following case of my own experience, the truth\nof the main facts in which can, I think, be substantiated by the gentleman to\nwhom the scenes were described in detail at the moment of their appearance\n%ad who, I think, is still living. Much circumstantial evidence, strongly\ncorroborative in its nature, may also be obtained, I think, by addressing\nany of the parties herein named, although I do not recollect ever talking\nwith them upon the subject, except the last named :\u2014\nMr. Maniphee Haun, Kismet, Morgan Co., Tenn.\nMr. W. T. Howard, Kismet.\nMr. Jas. Bales, Wartburg.\nMr. W. Todd, Wartburg.\nThe last named is the gentleman to whom I described the scenes as they\nwere presented to me ; while the first named is the gentleman who was\npresent when the tragedy happened, and would of course be likely to\nrecollect a large share of the minutie of the affair. The testimony therefore of\nthe two gentlemen is indispensable and should be obtained at once, but I\n. prefer that the society shall obtain this evidence independently of me, as\nthus avoiding any possible appearance of tinkering by me, although I shall\nbe very willing to render any assistance in the matter that I may be able.\nA Vision by Means op Pictures.\nThis incident occurred in Morgan Co., Tennessee, I think in the spring\nof 1878. Mrs. Wiltse and myself had spent the day with her mother and\nstep-father, Mr. and Mrs. Todd. I had passed most of the day with Mr.\nTodd in the field where he was planting corn. We retired early and Mrs.\nWiltse almost immediately fell asleep.\nMr. Todd and myself being wakeful, lay and talked. There was but\none room, in which there was an open fireplace containing fire mostly buried\n2 a\n\f574 F. W. H. Myers.\nup with ashes, a large pine knot having been laid on top of these embers, and\nso nearly buried in ashes as to give about a one candle power of light.\nThe following diagram will give a correct idea of the arrangement of\nthe room, beds, etc :\u2014\nX. Bed\nBed X. W.\nTodd's\nB.\nDoor Door\nE.\nFireplace\nX. Represents the heads of the beds.\nB. The bed occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Todd.\nW. The bed occupied by myself and Mrs. Wiltse, and\nE. The open fireplace. There wereseveral feet of space between the two beds.\nWhile we were talking, I saw a picture slide on to the wall at my feet,\nat such a height as to rest easily in the line of my vision. I called to Mr.\nand Mrs. Todd to cease talking and told them what I saw. The picture was\nsome feet in size each way and remained before me long enough for me to\ndescribe [it] in detail to them. It was a landscape, the main features in which\nwere a river with a large creek emptying into it very nearly at right\nangles. When I had given a full description, the picture disappeared with\na quick movement like that with which it had appeared, but in the opposite\ndirection from which it came. Mr. Todd said \"You have described\nEmerald River and Rock Creek where it empties into it,\"\u2014which I thought\ncorrect, as I was familiar with the two streams.\nWhile we were talking, another picture slid on to the wall in the same\nmanner as the first one. It was the same picture as the first with the\naddition of several open fields and wooded lands along the banks. In one\nof the fields was a log house with its surroundings which I did not recognise.\nThe picture remained stationary until I had described it thoroughly, when\nit disappeared similarly to the first.\nBoth Todd and his wife said I had described the \"Cass Davis house\"\nwhich was about a mile distant, across the river. At this another picture\nslid on to the wall, the very counterpart of the second one, except that a good\nportion of the landscape was left out, but the house was there, the door of\nwhich was closed, and as I announced its appearance, I heard the muffled\nreport of a gun on the inside of the house, and immediately afterwards,\nthe door flew open and a man rushed out seemingly in a great fright.\nAt this point Todd said, \"See here, Doc., are you seeing these things, or\njust playing off a drive on us?\" I assured him that I actually saw,\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 575\nor seemed to see, the things I described, although they did not seem\npossessed of solidity, but were more as if one should breathe over a looking-\nglass, then stand at some distance from it and observe his image ; it would\nlook shadowy and dim.\nIn the meantime the door of the house in the picture had been left open\nso that I could see into the house, where I saw a man staggering toward\nthe door with blood running from his mouth. He reached the door, where\nhe supported himself by leaning against the door-facing, and steadied himself\noff the door-step on to the ground. In so doing, he left the print of his\nhand in blood upon the door-facing.\nAt this point the picture again disappeared and was immediately re\nplaced by another much the same as the other, but in it the dead body\nof the man was lying on the ground some few feet from the door, while\nfrom the field advanced several people, with hoes and mattocks in their hands,\nwho gathered round the body in apparent excitement and consternation,\nwhen the picture vanished and I saw nothing more.\nI asked Todd if he was sure of the house ; he assured me that it bore\nthe exact description I had given. I asked if there was any rumour, or ever\nhad been to his knowledge, of a tragedy having occurred there. \" Not that\nhe had ever heard of.\" I believe I said that \"something of the kind has\noccurred there or else will. If it is past we may never know it ; if it is to\ncome, we may see.\"\nWhen the corn which Todd had planted that day was ready for hoeing, I\nj was with him again in the field a portion of a day, and together we left the\nfield and started to go to Wartburg, the county seat about two miles distant.\nOn the way we met Cam Davis, a quadroon, who asked us if we had heard of\nHenderson Whittaker killing himself. We had not, and he told us that\nduring the (forenoon I think) Whittaker went into the house, where Mr.\nHaun was sitting alone and asked Haun to loan him his rifle to go hunting.\nHaun pointed to the corner where the rifle stood, saying, \" I don't know\nwhether it is loaded or not. \" Whittaker put his mouth over the muzzle to blow\ninto the gun, pushing back the hammer with his foot. The foot slipped offand\nthe gun was discharged into his mouth. Haun ran out into the field for help.\nThe hands came up and I think found the young man dead in the yard. I\nhave also been told that the hand print of blood was left upon the door-\nfacing, but these lesser points can be learned best from parties who lived in\nthe neighbourhood at the time. The main points are absolutely certain. The\ntragedy occurred in the house I had described, and was of substantially\nthe nature I had described from the picture-writing on the wall.\n[Answers to Questions sent to Mr. William Todd, January 15th, 1891.]\n(Be Dr. Wiltse's Vision.)\nQ. 1.

Wiltse having told me of his \"prophetic vision,\" but whether it was\nbefore or after the fulfilment I can't say. However, the facts were about as\nfollows : The young man shot himself in the mouth while attempting to blow\nin the gun ; ball passed out through the back of his neck just in the edge\nof his hair, rupturing some large vein or artery. He fell instantly and was\nunable to utter a word intelligibly. He raised himself up on his hands with\nhis head drooping over, and from his mouth the blood ran profusely, making\na large pool of blood upon the floor. I ran about forty rods from the house\nto call the nearest help, and on returning found the young man lying full\nlength, flat on his face, dead, his hat lying on the doorstep ; the print of his\nhand made on door-casing ; it seemed that he had crawled out upon his\nhands and knees.\nNow the hand-print on the door ; the blood-stained hat on the doorsteps ;\nthe kind of house and its location ; the season of the year when the accident\noccurred, correspond with the Dr.'s vision, if I remember correctly.\nThe tragedy occurred, I think, in the month of July, not far from the\n18th. As to when the Dr. had this vision or dream I don't remember.\nNo. I don't remember thinking of his vision at the time, for, as before\nstated, I don't remember having heard it before, although I might have\nheard ib- Manifhee Haun.\nMr. J. Bales writes to Dr. Hodgson :\u2014\nWartburg, Tenn., March Uth, 1891.\nIn reply to yours of 2\/27, will say that I remember hearing Dr. Wiltse\ntalk of the occurrence you mentioned in regard to the tragedy which\nhappened at the Cass Davis Place. He told me of it before it happened, and\nwhen it did occur he came and asked me if I remembered what he had told me\nabout it before. As to the dates, I can't remember exactly, but it must have\nbeen twelve or fourteen years ago. There was no newspaper published here\nat that time, and there was never any publication of it, so far as I am aware.\nI do not remember the appearance of a bloody hand on the door or\nanywhere else, but there was blood on the house in different places.\nWould have answered you sooner, but I wanted to remember correctly\nbefore writing. Dr. A. S. Wiltse considered a truthful and honest man here.\nJames Bales.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 577\nMr. Howard writes to Dr. Hodgson :\u2014\nKismet, Tenn., March 23rd, 189[1].\nYour enquiry of recent date just received, and will say in reply that Dr.\nWiltse told his vision to Mr. William Todd and his wife, my stepfather and\nmy mother, a short time before the occurrence. I was informed by Mr. Todd\nthat the details in the case were exactly similar to the Dr.'s vision. My\nmother stated the same fact in my hearing, but she is now dead. I under\nstand from different parties that the blood print, &c., were exactly as seen in\nthe vision. Dr. Wiltse was stopping at our house (Mr. Todd's) at the time,\nand, after relating his vision, my stepfather recognised the place described\nas the \"Cass Davis House,\" where the tragedy afterwards occurred. I\nwould refer you to Mr. William Todd for further particulars, as he probably\nremembers the date ; I do not. ip jjoward\nI shall conclude this group with a case where there is again a\nsuggestion of personal guardianship and care. But the facts prefigured\ndo not fall within the life-history of the decedent ; so that if we\nsuppose that it was his spirit which foresaw and informed his niece of\nthe future, we must suppose also that he foresaw what would happen\nto his body after his death. The percipient, whom I have called Lady\nQ., has given me orally a slightly fuller account. An unauthorised\nversion of the main points here to be detailed was compiled shortly\nafter the event.\nP. 189.\nI have been asked to give an account of an experience which was certainly\nthe most remarkable in my life :\u2014a dream which came to me three times\nat long intervals, and which was at last fulfilled.\nMy father died when I was a child ; my mother married again, and I went\nto live with an uncle, who became like a father to me. In the spring of 1882\nI dreamt that my sister and I were sitting in my uncle's drawing-room. In\nmy dream it was a brilliant spring day, and from the window we saw quan\ntities of flowers in the garden, many more than were in fact to be seen from\nthat window. But over the garden there lay a thin covering of snow. I knew\nin my dream that my uncle had been found dead by the side of a certain\nbridle-path about three miles from the house\u2014 a field-road where I had often\nridden with him, and along which he often rode when going to fish in a\nneighbouring lake. I knew that his horse was standing by him, and that he\nwas wearing a dark homespun suit of cloth made from the wool of a herd\nof black sheep which he kept. I knew that his body was being brought\nhome in a waggon with two horses, with hay in the bottom, and that we\nwere waiting for his body to arrive. Then in my dream the waggon came to\nthe door ; and two men well known to me\u2014one a gardener, the other the\nkennel huntsman\u2014helped to carry the body up the stairs, which were rather\nnarrow. My uncle was a very tall and heavy man, and in my dream I saw the\nmen carrying him with difficulty, and his left hand hanging down and striking\nagainst the banisters as the men mounted the stairs. This detail gave me in\nmy dream an unreasonable horror. I could not help painfully thinking, Oh,\nwhy did they not prevent his hand from being bruised in this way 1\n\f578 F. W. H. Myers.\nIn the sadness and horror of this sight I awoke, and I slept no more that\nnight. I had determined not to tell my uncle of the dream ; but in the\nmorning I looked so changed and ill that I could not escape his affectionate\nquestioning ; and at last 1 told him of my vision of him lying dead in that\nfield-road. I had no anxiety about his health. He was a robust man of\nsixty-six, accustomed to hunt his own pack of hounds and to take much\nexercise. He listened to me very kindly, and although he was not himself\nat all alarmed by my dream, he offered me to do anything I liked which\nmight calm my mind. I begged him to promise me never to go alone by\nthat particular road. He promised me that he would always make an excuse\nto have a groom or some one with him ; I remember my compunction at the\nthought of giving him this trouble\u2014and yet I could not help asking for\nhis promise.\nThe impression of the dream grew gradually fainter, but it did not leave\nme ; and I remember that when a little boy came to stay with us some time\nafter, and boy-like drew his stick along the banisters as he went upstairs,\nthe sound brought back the horror of my dream. Two years passed by,\nand the thought of the dream was becoming less frequent, when I dreamt it\nagain with all its details the same as before, and again with the same pro\nfoundly disturbing effect. I told my uncle, and said to him that I felt sure\nthat he had been neglecting his promise, and riding by that field-road alone.\nHe admitted that he had occasionally done so, \"although,\" he said, \"I\nthink I have been very good on the whole.\" He renewed the promise ; and\nagain the impression grew weaker as four years passed by, during which I\nmarried and left his home. In the May of 1888 I was in London, expects\nbig my baby. On the night before I was taken ill, I dreamt the same dream\nagain, but with this variation. Instead of dreaming that I was at my uncle's\nhome with my sister, I knew in my dream that I was lying in bed in our\nLondon house. But from that bedroom, just as from the drawing-room in\nthe former dreams, I seemed to see my uncle lying dead in the same well-\nknown place. And I seemed also to perceive the same scene of the bringing\nhome of the body. Then came a new point. As I lay in bed, a gentleman\ndressed in black, but whose face I could not see, seemed to stand by me and\ntell me that my uncle was dead. I woke in great distress. But as I was ill from\nthen for two days, as soon as the child was born I ceased to dwell on the\ndream\u2014only I felt an overpowering desire to write at once to my uncle my\nself and to tell him that I was getting better. I was not allowed to do this ;\nbut afterwards I managed to write a few lines in pencil unknown to any\none but the nurse. This note reached my uncle two days before his death.\nAs I grew better, I began to wonder greatly at not hearing from my uncle,\nwho generally wrote to me every day. Then my dream came back to me,\nand I was certain that he was ill or dead\u2014but my husband, nurse, and maid\n(all I saw) seemed cheerful as usual. Then one morning my husband said\nmy stop-father wished to see me, and I at once guessed his errand. He\nentered the room dressed in black and stood by my bedside. At once I\nrecognised that this was the figure which I had seen in my dream. I said,\n\" The Colonel is dead\u2014I know all about it\u2014I have dreamt it often.\" And\nas he was unable to speak from emotion, I told him all about it, place, time\nof day (morning), and the clothes my uncle wore.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 579\nThen I thought of that scene on the staircase, which had always remained\nin my mind. I asked if there were any bruises on the hands. \" No bruises,\"\nsaid my step-father, \" either on hands or face. \" Ho thought that I fancied\nthat my uncle had fallen from his horse. Soon afterwards my sister\u2014the\nsister who had been in my dream\u2014came to see me, and brought rue a ring\nwhich my uncle had always worn on his left hand. I was very thankful for\nthis memento of him ; and I told my sister how I had feared that the ring\nwould have been forgotten. \"I only came just in time,\" she said ; \"they\nwere just going to close the coffin.\" \" Was there any bruise on the left\nhand ? \" I asked. At first she said that there was not ; but then she said she\nthought there was a bluish discoloration across the back of the first joints of\nthe fingers. She did not know how it had been caused. When I was well\nenough to travel, I went to my old home ; there I saw my old nurse, who had\nbeen in the house when my uncle died. Her account, added to my step\nfather's, enabled me to realise the events of that day. My uncle had received\nmy pencil note on the Sunday morning, and had been greatly pleased,\nfeeling that the wished-for heir was born, and that I, whom he loved as a\ndaughter, was through my trouble. He had a few friends to lunch with him,\nincluding my step-father, and said that he had seen all that he wished to see\nin life, and could now die happy at any moment. His guests left him in [the]\ngreatest spirits, and two days afterwards he died, and his body had been\nbrought back as I describe, and he had been found half sitting and half\nlyingin that very field-road, where I had three times seen him. He was\ndressed in the same homespun suit in which I had seen him in my dream.\n= The cause of his death had been heart-disease, of whose existence neither I\nnor, I believe, any of those near or dear to him had been aware. He had\nevidently felt faint, and slipped from his horse. The same two men whom I\nhad seen in my dream as helping to carry the body had in fact done so, and\nmy nurse admitted that the left hand knocked against the banisters. She\nseemed afraid lest I should blame the men who carried the body, and did\nnot like to speak of the incident. I do not think that she had seen the\nincident herself ; and I did not like to speak to the men about it. It was\nenough for me that it was on the back of the left hand, as I had see it in my\ndream and as from the arrangement of the staircase it must have been, had it\nbeen caused in the way that I saw. I will add one fact which, although it\nwas purely a matter of my own feeling, made perhaps as much impression\nupon me as anything in this history. I do not think that any daughter\ncould love a'father better than I loved my uncle ; and, as will have been\nseen, the prospect of his death was always a deeply-lying fear. But as soon\nas I knew that all had happened as my dream foretold, I somehow felt that\nall was well ; and the death left me with a sensation of complete acquiescence\nand peace. It may have been noticed that there were two unreal or fan\ntastic points in my original dream :\u2014viz., the multitude of flowers in the\ngarden, and the thin covering of snow. I think that I can throw some\nlight on these points by narrating the only two other impressive dreams\nwhich I have ever had. The first of these two dreams I mentioned to\nothers, and acted upon it. The second I neither mentioned nor acted upon ;\nso that it has no value as evidence, and is really given as helping to explain\nthe symbolism of snow.\n\f580 F. W. H. Myers.\nI had heard from several relations (although I cannot quote definite\ncases), that they had found that dreams of flowers and of snow were followed\nby deaths in our family. This may have suggested that form of symbolism\nto my mind ;\u2014or the same cause, whatever it was, which acted with them\nmay have acted with me. In any case, what happened was as follows. In\n1887 I heard from my step-father that my mother, who had long been an\ninvalid, was seriously worse ; and he asked me when I could go to see her.\nMy mind was therefore occupied with her illness ; but the tone of his letter\nwas not immediately alarming ;\u2014so that we saw no reason for my not attend\ning some races in the neighbourhood, for which we had friends staying. But one\nnight I dreamt a dream\u2014which, though very impressive, was somewhat con\nfused\u2014about my mother seated in a carriage full of jlmeers. I remembered\nthe symbolism ; and I felt assured that my mother was dead or dying. I\nmentioned the dream to my husband and prepared for an immediate summons,\nwhich came directly afterwards. Having all preparations already made, I\nleft immediately and arrived in time to see my mother die. This dream and\nthat of my uncle are the only dreams on which 1 ever acted in any way. The\nsecond dream to which I have alluded was as follows :\u2014In 18\u2014 I saw a\ngentleman whom I knew lyiug dead in a red coat on an open field with snow\non the ground. Beside him knelt his mother,\u2014who was alive and well at the\ntime of the dream. I tried to approach and speak to her ; but she said,\n\" Don't touch me, I have come for him.\" I understood that she had died\nbefore him. Two years later this lady did in fact die, and in two years more\nher son was killed, just as I saw him lying, in a scarlet coat. There was, of\ncourse, no snow on the ground, as it was in late spring ; so I fancy that the\nsnow may have been symbolical both here and in my dream about my uncle.\nI may add that I am not of an imaginative temperament ; and that these are\nthe only incidents in my life which seem to lie outside ordinary explanations.\nMy husband and step-father add their confirmation of the incidents which\nconcern them.\nThe above account is true and accurate in every particular.\nDecember 22nd, 1892. [Signatures of Lord and Lady Q.]\n[Lord Q.'s signature attests (besides his general concurrence with the\naccount) his presence at the interview with Lady Q.'s step-father, as\ndescribed.]\nThe account is correct so far as what happened when I went to London\nto inform Lady Q of her uncle's death, which is all that is within my\nown personal knowledge.\nJanuary 16th, 1893. [Signature of Lady Q.'s step-father.]\nWe have few well-attested cases where any event subsequent to\nhis own death has been intimated to any percipient. Here is one with\nfair attestation.\nP. 153.\nLouise Chandler Moulton in the Arena, 1892.\nIn the Cosmopolitan Magazine for November, an article of my own was\npublished, entitled \"Five Friends\u2014The Story of an Extinct Household.\"\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 581\nIt was a sketch of the last sad years of Dr. Westland Marston and his chil\ndren ; and it contained the account of a very singular spiritualistic prophecy\nas to the succession of deaths by which this household became extinct\u2014a\nprophecy often repeated to me while all the persons mentioned in it were\nstill alive and well. This remarkable instance of what seems like spirit\nforeknowledge made a wide impression, if I am to judge by the numerous\nletters I received on the subject from all parts of the United States and from\nEngland. Among these letters was one in itself so astonishing that I wrote\nto its author for permission to publish it. Here is the letter :\u2014\n64, John Street, Providence, December 5th, 1891.\nMrs. Louise Chandler Moulton.\nDear Madam,\u2014I have just read your article \"Five Friends,\" and the\nsingular fulfilment of the prophecy regarding the death of the Marstons re\ncalls a similar prophecy in my own experience, and its fulfilment, which may\ninterest you.\nI was the medical adviser of the family of Hiram Maxfield, a hotel keeper\nand caterer, widely known throughout New England. They were a very\nhealthy family, seldom ill, any of them, except with some minor ailment.\nOne day I was called to see Mrs. Maxfield at their home, a few miles down\nthe bay. While waiting for the return boat, the eldest daughter, a young\nlady of about 20, came out upon the porch, where I was standing, and said\nthat she wanted to tell me something, but it appeared so foolish to her that\nshe wanted me to say nothing about it to the family. She said that she had\nheard a voice say, distinctly : \"You will die first, then Harry, then father.\"\nShe was alone at the time, and thought that some one must have spoken to\nher from an adjoining room. She went to the door, looked in, saw no one,\nand soon heard the words repeated with the addition, \" And Dr. Anthony\nwill be present in each case.\"\nAll three of the persons mentioned in this prophecy were then appar\nently in perfect health. About two years after\u2014the young lady having\nmarried in the meantime\u2014I was called in to see her. She had been stricken\nwith apoplexy, and died in a few minutes after my arrival. The son, Harry,\nabout this time developed symptoms of consumption ; and with him the end\ncame in about six months. He had been away in another climate, under\nthe care of a physician, but as he was failing rapidly, was brought home. I\nwas sent for and arrived just before he breathed his last.\nAbout a year after this, the father of the family contracted a cold on a\nfishing trip to New Hampshire, which resulted in his death soon after his\nreturn. I was sent for, as usual, and only failed to be present at the moment\nof his death because I stepped out for an instant to send a telephone mes\nsage, and he had breathed his last just before my return. Thus was the pro\nphecy fulfilled. I must add that neither the family nor myself had any\nbelief in spiritualism.\u2014Respectfully yours, -yy g. Anthony M.D.\nIn the case of the Marstons the prophecy, purporting to come from the\nspirit of Mrs. Marston, and to be addressed to the eldest daughter of the\nhousehold, was : \" You will die first, then Nelly, then Philip, and last of all\nyour father ; \" and it was literally fulfilled, as was the one related by Dr.\nAnthony concerning the Maxfields.\n\f582 F. W. H. Myers.\nAsked as regards the date of this incident, Dr. Anthony writes :\u2014\n64, John Street, Providence, May 6th, 1892.\nRichard Hodgson, Esq., \u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I have found the account books\nof which I wrote, and the only visit which I find was made to Mrs. M.\nprevious to the daughter's death, was April 22nd, 1877. So I can fix upon\nthat date definitely, as the date of the prophecy. Her daughter died\nNovember 9th, 1879. Harry died June 29th, 1881, and Mr. Maxfield died\nJuly 2nd, 1884. After the death of the daughter, either the same day, or\nsoon after, I told the prophecy to the lady who is now my wife.\nW. E. Anthony, M.D.\nMay 6th, 1893.\nRichard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I have a distinct recollection that the\nDoctor told me of the singular fulfilment of the prophecy of the death of the\nlady mentioned, soon after it occurred. I think it was on the evening of the\nsame day, that she died. If the date of the death was Sunday, then I am\nquite certain as to time, as I seldom saw him on other evenings.\nMarie L. Anthony.\n[The date of the death, November 9th, 1879, was in fact a Sunday.]\nIn the next case also the speaker points to events in which he will\nno longer share.\nP. 216. Soldier's prophecy.\n[This case was received through the kindness of Mr. Ropes, of Boston,\nwell known as an authority on the American Civil War.]\nJohn R. Davis.\nCincinnati, Ohio, August 26th, 1893.\nMy Dear Mr. Ropes,\u2014Enclosed the story of the soldier's prophecy. I\nsent copy to Captain Ball, to know if it corresponds with his recollection.\nAs I remember Davis, he was barely able to read and write. From the\nregimental descriptive book which I have, I take the following :\u2014\n\" John R. Davis enlisted October 9th, '61. Age, 44 ; occupation, labourer;\nborn in South Wales. Height, five feet, seven. Blue eyes, iron gray hair.\"\nThe story may be of no value, but it is the only really unaccountable thing\nof which I have personal knowledge.\u2014Yours very truly, j\u00a3 q dawes\nIn August, 1863, I was major of the 53rd Ohio Regiment, and in the\nabsence of the other field officers, was in command. The regiment was then\nin the Third Brigade, Fourth Division, 15th Army Corps. It was encamped\nat Messenger's Fort on Black river, about sixteen miles east of Vicksburg,\nMiss. One morning I went to see the Division Commander, General Hugh\nEwing, on some business. As I started away, he told me that he had just\nreceived notice from General Sherman, then Corps Commander, to take the\ndivision to Natchez. I asked if there was reason why I should not speak of\nit. He said there was not, and that the order would probably reach me that\nevening.\nAs I rode into our camp, I noticed in the police detail an old man named\nJohn R. Davis, a private soldier in company E. He appeared to be unwell,\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 583\nand I told the sergeant to relieve him from duty. Thinking to please him\nwith advance news, I asked Davis to sit down in front of my tent, and said to\nhim, \" Well, Davis, we are going to Natohez.\" \" Who is going to Natchez ?\"\nhe replied. \" The regiment is going,\u2014the whole division is going,\" said I.\n\" No,\" answered Davis, \"The division is not going to Natchez; the regi\nment is not going.\" \" How do you know so much ? When did you take com\nmand of the army?\" I said, perhaps a little impatiently. ,' I do not wish to be\ndisrespectful,\" he replied, \" but we are not going to Natchez. I can see the\ntroops marching off the transports at Memphis, and I cannot see any more.\"\nThen, after a pause, he added, \"These things come to me in dreams, and\nthey always come true. \" \" How do you know they are our troops ? \" \"lean\nsee you on the deck pointing.\" \"Where are you?\" \"Iam not there.'\n\"Are you going to get a furlough ? \" \" No, I am going to die.\"\nNo amount of questioning could get anything more from him. In the\nafternoon 1 went to brigade headquarters. Lieut. E. H. Ball, then A.A.A.G.,\nwas an officer in the company Davis belonged to. I told him the story, and\nasked him to detail Davis for some light duty at brigade headquarters.\nLieut. Ball secured the detail at once, and Davis went there the following\nday. The order to go to Natchez was countermanded before it reached the\nregiments. Davis died September 5th, immediately after the battle of\nChickamauga. The Corps 15th was ordered to Chattanooga, via Vicksburgand\nMemphis. I was still commanding the regiment, and was the last of the corps\nto leave Vicksburg, but by good fortune was the first of the division to reach\nMemphis. Landing at the city wharf, I started to go off the boat at the head\n-xi the regiment. The captain of the boat asked me to come up to the cabin\nfor some purpose. As I came to the head of the stairway, I saw the Lieutenant\nColonel of the regiment, who had been for some time at home, on the wharf.\nI went to the guards, and leaning over the rail, pointed to him and called to\nthe adjutant to report the regiment to him. There was (and it at once\noccurred to me) the literal fulfilment of Davis' prophecy. The Division did\nnot go to Natchez, Davis was dead, the troops were marching off the trans\nports at Memphis, I was on deck and pointing. E. C. Dawes.\nCincinnati, Ohio, September 25th, 1893.\nDear Mr. Ropes, \u2014Yours, with copy of letter from the Society of\nPsychical Research, at hand. Captain Ball was in my office to-day. I\nhanded him the letter. He remembers Davis as a man of little education,\nbut intelligent, quick, and nervous in his movements ; and he reminded me\nof a notable event in his career, when Davis got very drunk in Memphis,\nand defied the guard with an empty pistol. He was fond of liquor, though\nseldom under its influence.\nIn August, 1863, the impression in the army of the Tennessee was that\nunless the rebels took the offensive, which we deemed very improbable, we\nshould remain in camp until September or October, and then go to Selma or\nMobile. As I find time, I will look through my letters home that summer\n(most of which I have), and see what I then sent, which will give a clue to\nthe current opinion. I do not think I wrote home about Davis. My people\nknew only three or four persons in our regiment. I went to it a stranger,\nand in my letters I seldom speak of any one.\u2014Yours truly,\nE. C. Dawes.\n\f584 F. W. H. Myers.\nCincinnati, Ohio, October 3th, 1893.\nJohn Ropes, Esq.,\u2014Dear Mr. Ropes,\u2014After the surrender of Vicks-\nburg, and the return to Black river of the forces that under General Sherman\nhad driven Johnston east of Pearl river, an unusually large number of fur\nloughs were granted to officers and men of the army of the Tennessee. This\nwas accepted as an indication that no movement would be made by the army\nduring the month of August, at least. The current opinion was that in Sep\ntember or October, General Banks would be sent to capture Mobile, and that\nthe army of the Tennessee would co-operate by moving directly east through\nMeridian to Selma. The moral of the army was never better. Officers and men. ^\nhad implicit confidence in their ability to defeat any Confederate army that\ncould then be brought to take the field against them. The only suggestion of a\nmovement north, I remember, was that some troops might be sent to capture\nthe large amount of railroad equipment known to have been concentrated\nat Grenada, Miss., and to remain near Grenada while the rolling stock was\ntaken to Memphis. In fact, this was attempted by a small force of cavalry,\nwho destroyed, instead of saving it. E. C. Dawes.\n50, State Street, Boston, October ISth, 1893.\nRichard Hodgson, Esq.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I enclose you a letter from Col.\nE. C. Dawes, dated the 14th inst., and also one from Captain E. H. Ball,\ndated the 12th inst.\nCaptain Ball, you remember, commanded the company in which Davis,\nthe private soldier who prophesied that the regiment was going to Memphis.,\nwas. J. C. Ropes. \\\n48, Laclede Building, St. Louis, Mo., October Uth, 1893.\nDear Mr. Ropes,\u2014Before leaving home Tuesday, I wrote Captain Ball\nas suggested in yours of 5th. I reminded him of something that will\nserve to refresh his memory. Ball was very anxious to get a furlough in\nAugust, '63, to go to his old home in Haverhill, Mass. His first application\nwas refused. After Davis was detailed at Brigade headquarters, Ball\nannoyed the old man a good deal by trying to get him to foretell whether a\nsecond application would be successful. Davis would always reply that he\ndid not know anything about it, that these tilings came to him in dreams,\nand always came true. I hope to find a letter from Captain Ball at home\nto-morrow. E. C. Dawes.\nPortsmouth, Ohio, October 12th. 1893.\nJohn C. Ropes, Esq.,\u2014My Dear Sir,\u2014In answer to yours of the 5th, I\nhave to say that I remember very^well that, some time in August, 1863, Major\nE. C. Dawes, then commanding 53rd Ohio Regiment, came to headquarters.\nThird Brigade, Fourth Division, 15th Army Corps, of which I was temporarily\nA.A.A.G., and told me of a curious prophecy made by John R. Davis, an\nold man - for a soldier,\u2014and a member of my company. Davis predicted\nthat troops would go on transports to Memphis, and that he would die before\nthey went. Major Dawes asked me to give Davis an easy place at brigade\nheadquarters, saying that he was sick and perhaps a little offhis base. I had\nhim detailed, and tried to get him to prophesy for me without success. He\nsaid he could not prophesy, that things came to him in dreams and they\nalways came true, and he did not know anything about them.\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 585\nI went home on leave in September, and did not return to the regiment\nuntil just before the battle of Missionary Ridge.\nDavis did die and the troops did go to Memphis on transports. \u2014Yours\ntruly. E. H. Ball.\nIt will be observed that this soldier's prediction comes nearer than\nany case with which we have yet dealt to the ancient conception of\nprophecy,\u2014a revelation not petty nor personal, but of great issues, and\nfor some lofty end. Such prophecies are apt to be difficult to prove as\nsuch,\u2014to distinguish from the sage's foresight as to the trend and\nstream of things. And, on the other hand, so far as these grave\ncommunications claim a divine inspiration, this is hardly to be\ndistinguished from the subliminal messages of which we have so often\nspoken. It is among two religious bodies widely divergent in dogmatic\nteaching that such celestial promptings have seemed to have most of\ncogency,\u2014in the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages, and among the\nearliest members of the Society of Friends. It is much to be desired\nthat the scattered indications of monition and premonition which\nrecords of this type contain should be collected by some critical though\nsympathetic hand. The early Friends especially presented a character\nwhich cannot be alien to the best humanity of any age. Their com\nbination of sober common-sense with inward openness to illumination,\n\u2014the steady expectancy of their calm untroubled souls,\u2014this is the\ntemper which our inquiry needs, and which other men may surely attain\nin the future as fully as these men in the past.\nI have now given specimens of all the classes of evidence known to\nme which bear on the relation of supernormal phenomena to time, and\nhave endeavoured to throw such light as was possible on each in turn.\nThe result is to me at least in one way of much interest. For these\nphenomena of retrocognition and precognition, covering a wide range,\nand regarded now in a new light, are found to have a close connection\nwith my whole group of previously accepted generalisations,\u2014to lend\nconfirmation to them, and to receive confirmation from them in turn.\nI may be able to make all this clearer\u2014I hope that I shall not\nseem to make it more dogmatic\u2014by a diagrammatic scheme which\nwill at least offer to criticism definite points of attack. But if, instead\nof a plane surface and a few black lines, I could exhibit a transparent\nglobe, varying in density, colour, and luminosity, we should still have\nan absurdly inadequate symbol of that n-dimensional infinitude of\nliving faculty some few of whose properties we dimly discern. Nay,\nscant as it is, the diagram is itself misleading. The opposite direction\nof its lines implies no ultimate divergence ; all alike must be assumed\nto meet at infinity.\n\f\fThe Subliminal Self. 587\nA short description will indicate what I have tried to express by\nthis diagram.\n1. The dark and the dotted circle represent sections of concentric\nspheres ; of which the upper hemispheres represent the Future,\nand the lower the Past. The vertical diameter divides material\nphenomena on the left from mental on the right. The thick line\nAB represents what I have elsewhere called \" the spectrum of\nordinary consciousness \" ; extending from the red end at A, where our\nvoluntary control over the body and our ordinary perceptions of its\nprocesses cease, to the violet end at B, where the range of our higher\nsenses and of our intellect finds its term.\n2. The small thick circle of which AB is a diameter represents that\narea of time past and future which is within the grasp of the empirical\nor supraliminal self,\u2014by recollection of the past or reasoned inference\nas to the future. This is a kind of \" circle of perpetual apparition\";\na small circle of the cosmic sphere, within which (save in sleep, &c.)\nthe stars never set.\n3. The dotted circle indicates the realm of the subliminal Self ;\nemerging into separate consciousness from the World-Soul in which it\nis immersed, much as the dark circle rises into separate consciousness\nout of the dotted circle of the larger Self.\nThe metaphor of a threshold of emergence, however, which the words\nsupraliminal and subliminal imply, is not expressed by the position of\nlines as higher or lower in the plane of my diagram. Rather the small\ncircle, the supraliminal area, must be conceived as subjectively central\nto the larger circle, or area of subliminal perception and control.\n4. The line A'B' represents the spectrum of man's subliminal con\nsciousness at any given moment. It runs along the upper side of the\nthick line AB, because in this diagram Future is above and Past is\nbelow ; and the subliminal consciousness, even if assumed to be acting\nthrough the mediacy of the senses, must needs be always slightly ahead\nof the empirical or organic ; since an appreciable time is consumed in\nthe act of sensation itself, and in the passage from sensation to\nperception. The consequences of this fact were indicated when the\nphenomena of promnesia, or apparent memory of the present moment,\nwere above discussed.\n5. Conformably with what has been said above, and following the\nthick line in the direction of A, the line AA' will represent the exten\nsion of subliminal control over the organism, beyond the limit of em\npirical or voluntary control. This extended power of modifying the\norganism, which we may term hyperboulia, has already met us in\nvarious phenomena of hypnotism or of hysteria ;\u2014for instance, in the\nre-establishment of suppressed secretions.\n\f588 F. W. H. Myers.\n6. Carried on to a still further point, under the guidance of\ndisembodied intelligences, the line A'A\" will indicate that extension\nof will-power beyond the periphery which I regard as the basis of\nsuch supernormal power over matter as I believe to have been\nmanifested through the agency of some few persons. Produced to\ninfinity this line may be supposed to indicate the mysterious connexion\nof Mind and Matter,\u2014the magnum corpus with which the World-\nSoul is mingled in some identity beyond our ken.\n7. Following now the thick line AB in the direction of B, the\nline BB' will represent the extension of subliminal perception, first\nhypersesthetic, using the sense-organs with increasing delicacy ; then\ntelsesthetic, or depending no longer on sense-organs, but on that\ntranscendental receptivity of which telepathy is the commonest type.\n8. Passing on beyond the indefinite limitary circle of the sub\nliminal self, we may take the line B'B\" as symbolizing the commerce\nof man's spirit with the world of unembodied mind, as in prayer or\necstacy. Produced to infinity, the line may indicate the Cosmos in\nits intellectual aspect,\u2014the Mens which mingles with the magnum\ncorpus of the material world.\n9. And now for the relations to Time of the faculties thus\nindicated. The top of this diagram represents the Future, the bottom\nthe Past. The oblique ordinates which start from M\u2014the focus of\nman's consciousness \u2014 represent the pathways along which I think\nthat we have actual evidence of man's access to past and future things.\nThe rectangular ordinates, representing direct intuition of Past and\nFuture, by our own or higher minds, belong to that speculative\nconception of a World-Soul involving both Future and Past of which\nI have already spoken.\n10. Let us next follow the oblique ordinate which starts from M,\nand passes through C and C' to C\". This line represents the physical\nor organic aspect of memory. From M to C we have supraliminal\norganic memory ;\u2014such physical memories, that is to say, as can be\nsummoned up at will. From C to C we have subliminal organic\nmemories, including the whole range from hypnotism to heredity.\nFor heredity itself is in some sort a transmitted memory, and a record\nof all ancestors is implicit in the germ. Following the line from\nC to C\", beyond the limits of the profounder organic personality, we\nmeet the question whether any similar trace, or persistent record of\npast experiences, can inhere also and be discernible in inorganic\nthings.\nThe luminescent pebble glows with the treasured light of long-set\nsuns. And if this delicate and fugitive energy of light be thus\npersistent, who shall imit the influences which may have stored\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 589\nthemselves within the labyrinth of vibrations which constitute the\npebble ?\u2014influences evocable, perhaps, and recognisable when the\nsummons and the perception come.\nIt is conceivable, then, that the line C'C\", prolonged to infinity,\nmight give us a complete history of every infinitely smallest particle in\nthe universe, from infinitely remote time.\n11. And next let us follow the ordinate MDD'D\"\u2014the line which\nrepresents intellectual, as distinguished from organic, memory ; the\nsynthetized and symbolical recollection which is what we consciously\nretain of the Past. From M to D the line thus represents the\nmemory which we habitually employ ; from D to D' it represents the\nhypermnesic, or fuller, but still synthetized and personal memory of\nour past experiences which we have found the subliminal self to possess.\nPassing out at D' from the sphere of the Self, we come to memories\npossessed by other spirits, from which memories it may be possible that\nknowledge passes to incarnate men. Each spirit's memory, like each\nhuman memory, will presumably be unified by a personal synthesis.\nIt will be a subjective or impressionist record of a special segment of\nthe past.\n12. And now between these two types of memory\u2014the memory\nimplicate in Matter, living or dead, and the memory implicate in Mind,\nembodied or disembodied,\u2014I draw a rectangular ordinate MEE'E\" to\nrepresent direct retrocognition, by our own or by higher minds ;\u2014\nsuch persistence of the Past as an object of thought as may inhere\nneither in material traces nor in reminiscence of personal experience.\nWhat has been still may be ; and not merely as trace recognisable\nin matter or as former impression revivable in mind. There may\nbe a self-existent and imprescriptible Cosmorama ; a conservation\nat once of all thought and of all phenomena ; the World-Soul as\nthe Past.\n13. And now passing on to those ordinates which symbolise the\nfuture, let us begin with the oblique ordinate MFF'F\", whose position\non the scheme shows it to indicate organic precognition. The ordinary or\nsupraliminal segment of this line, MF, is represented by a physician's,\nor rather by the patient's own instinctive prognosis. Passing on into\nthe wider circuit of subliminal faculty, the line FF' indicates suggestion,\nself-suggestion,\u2014organic clairvoyance,\u2014the profounder prognosis which\ncorresponds to hyperboulia ; since increased power over the organism\nimplies increased knowledge, and increased knowledge implies increased\nforesight. All are now familiar with the process of setting (so to say)\nthe organic clock to strike at a given hour. But not all psychologists\nhave realised all that is implied in the supraliminal unconsciousness of\nthe suggested subject ; who bears within him the germ of a complex\n\f590 F. W. H. Myers.\nthought or action which to him will seem spontaneous and free ; yet\nwhich will fulfil itself for him as irresistibly as the pang of hunger or\nthe languor of sleep.\nBeyond the circuit of the Self, the line F'F\" denotes spirit-\nprognosis, spirit-suggestion ; the foretelling of predetermined organic\nchanges, including bodily death ; and the recommendation of remedies\nwhich may modify or postpone such changes. There is some evidence\n(as yet, unfortunately, mainly of a private kind) that such advice can\nbe given as from unseen intelligences,\u2014which are not, however, able\nto foresee (any more than an earthly physician can foresee) the\npossible events from outside, o'r changes in the environment, whioh\nmay make the prescriptions of no avail.\n14. And now let us pass on from organic prevision to that great\ngroup of cases which I will provisionally class under the heading of\ntelcesthetic inference, but which depend no doubt on causes far more\nvaried and complex than we can at present fathom.\nWe have already seen that hyperesthesia involves hypermnesia ;\nthat is, when more is perceived more will be remembered. In the same\nmanner hypersesthesia involves what we might call hyper-promethia ;\nthat is, when more is perceived, more will be foreseen. The line MG\nrepresenting ordinary foresight, the line GG' represents the foresight of\nthe subliminal self ; based, as I have said, on hypersesthesia, and also\non the telepathy and telsesthesia into which this hypersesthesia inscrut\nably passes. Nor have we any theoretical limit to what the incarnate\nsoul may thus foresee. In many of our cases there is absolutely no clue\nto the source of precognition ; and we may ascribe all these, if we will,\nto the subliminal self without extraneous aid.\nYet, on the other hand, there are many cases where the agency of\nunembodied spirits is asserted, and with evidence that cannot be\nignored. The line G'G\" represents the foresight of unembodied\nintelligences ; nor can we guess how high may be the communicating\nintelligence, how far-reaching its prefigurement of what for us has\nyet to be.\n15. We are led thus to our last, our boldest conjecture. The line\nfrom M to H\" represents the possibility of a knowledge which comes\nto man from no individuated, or at least from no human source ;\nwhich is no longer inference but the reflection of Reality itself ;\nof the World-Soul as the Future ; of a pre-existent Cosmorama of\ninfinite fates.\nIt is to this last line of reflection that the few concluding paragraphs\nmust be devoted. And first a few words as to the relation of our\nevidence to the problem of Free Will. Here I have a suggestion to\nmake which even in this time-worn controversy is, I think, absolutely\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 591\nnovel. It is that we have now a possibility of making the question\nbetween liberty and determination a matter of actual experiment.\nLet us put that old question in this specific form\u2014\"Is there\nevidence that any power can show me a picture involving my own\n(so-called) voluntary actions in the future, which picture I cannot\nby any effort in the smallest degree hinder from becoming actual\nfact?\"\nFor mere ordinary prevision this would of course be impossible.\nBut we have here certain foreshadowings which depend on no ordinary\nprevision, and which are more wholly outside ourselves than any in\nformation of equally definite character which we can otherwise receive.\nThe scenes or statements thus given in complete detail seem sometimes\nto be fulfilled with equal completeness. But must they, or must any\nof them, inevitably be thus fulfilled 1 Here it is that a possibility of\nexperiment comes in. The experiment indeed cannot be conclusive\neither way. But suppose that\u2014as in some folk-lore story\u2014we were to\nmake vigorous effort to avert some incident, and were yet to find that\nincident fulfil itself, perhaps by dint of that very effort, exactly after\nthe dreaded fashion,\u2014should we not then have some reason to infer\nthat earth-life was not really modifiable by anything which we feel as\nfree-will 1\n-* Assuming such a result of our experiment, analogy would at once\nsuggest a further possibility. For our life on earth would then be seen\nto resemble the experience of the hypnotised subject, fulfilling un\nwittingly in waking hours the suggestions previously made to him in\nthe trance. We should ask whether in our own history some epoch\nmay have existed in which a self-suggestion may have been given\nwhich could similarly dominate our earthly career. Our complex\norganism, the result of a long previous history, is felt to restrict our\nso-called voluntary action within narrow limits ; and if we possess also\na soul independent of the body, it is surely likely that the soul's\nprevious history also\u2014for some previous history any entity so highly\nspecialised as a man's soul must have had\u2014may exercise a determining\ninfluence, even more profound than the organism's influence, upon the\nthoughts and actions of this incarnation. There may, in short, be a\nkind of alternating personality, expressing itself first in an incorporeal\nand then in a corporeal state, in such a way that the incorporeal state\nis the deeper and the more permanent, and that suggestions thence\nderived influence corporeal life, although the empirical consciousness\nwhich governs that life may never know it.\nThis idea, of course, is not new to religion or to philosophy, in\nEast or West, and it has long since been suggested that our earthly\nexistence may be the inevitable sequel of our past eternity ; a pre\ndestined pilgrimage on which our true soul looks with calm content ;\n2 t\n\f592 F. W. H. Myers.\nsince not one of earth's phantom sorrows can find her unwilling or\nstrike her unaware. The soul foretaught, the body forewrought,\u2014\nthese will move onwards as they must and may ; but meanwhile the\nproblem of Liberty and Necessity will no longer be one for earthly ex\nperience to discuss ; it will be lifted into a pre-natal region, among the\nsecrets of the transcendental world.\nAll this must be conceived as possible ; yet I do not think that our\nevidence thus far collected does in fact make for this view of pre\ndetermined earthly fates. Rather we have seen that in many cases\nmonitions have averted incidents which would doubtless have occurred\nhad the percipient received no warning. And where dangers have\nbeen foreshewn and yet not averted, this seems often to have been\nbecause no adequate effort was made to avert them. The problem\nwhich our narratives more urgently suggest is how to reconcile so much\nforeknowledge with so much freedom. I have thought sometimes that\nthis problem of free human wills amid the predictable operations of\nunchanging law may resemble the problem of molecular motion amid\nmolar calm. Clear and stable is for us the diamond ; the dewdrop is\nclear and still ; yet within their tranquil clarity a myriad molecules\njostle in narrow orbits or speed on an uncomputed way. So to \" the\nspectator of all Time and of all Existence \" may the Cosmos be \" as one\nentire and perfect chrysolite ; \" and yet man's petty hopes and\npassions may make endless turmoil among its minutest elements and in\nits infinitesimal grains. Those movements too must be ruled by\nunknown law ; yet on a wide view they will average out, and will\nadmit of predictions fulfilled immutably, and overriding the small Wills\nof men.\nOnce more, and from a different standpoint. Few men have\npondered long on these problems of Past and Future without wonder\ning whether Past or Future be in very truth more than a name\u2014\nwhether we may not be apprehending as a stream of sequence that\nwhich is an ocean of co-existence, and slicing our subjective years and\ncenturies from timeless and absolute things. The precognition dealt\nwith in this chapter, indeed, hardly overpasses the life of the individual\npercipient. Let us keep to that small span, and let us imagine that a\nwhole earth-life is in reality an absolutely instantaneous although an\ninfinitely complex phenomenon. Let us suppose that my transcend\nental self discerns with equal directness and immediacy every element\nof this phenomenon ; but that my empirical self receives each element\nmediately and through media involving different rates of retardation :\njust as I receive the lightning more quickly than the thunder. May\nnot then seventy years intervene between my perceptions of birth and\ndeath as easily as seven seconds between my perceptions of the flash\nand peal 1 And may not some inter-communication of consciousness\n\fThe Subliminal Self. 593\nenable the wider self to call to the narrower, the more central to the\nmore external, \" At such an hour this shock will reach you ! Listen\nfor the nearing roar ! \"\nAnd thinking thus of the Universe as no mere congeries of\nindividual experiences, but as a plenum of infinite knowledge of which\nall souls form part, we come to count less and less upon having to\ndeal exclusively with intelligences individualised like our own. Our\nlimitations of personality may less and less apply to spirits drawing\nmore directly upon the essential reality of things. The definite\nintelligences which have crystallised, so to say, out of the psychical\nvapour may even for us become again partly sublimated, may again\nbe diffused for a moment amid such knowledge as our organisations\ncannot receive except in ecstasy and bewilderment, or retain except in\nvanishing symbol and obscure and earthly sign.\nIf then all these phenomena form part of one great effort by which\nman's soul is striving to know his spiritual environment, and his\nspiritual environment is striving to become known, how little can it\nmatter what the special incident foretold or foreshadowed may be !\nWhat signifies it whether this or that earthly peril be averted, or\nearthly benefit secured,\u2014whether through this or that petty channel\nshall flow some stream of mortal things 1 The prime need of man\nis to know more fully, that he may obey more unhesitatingly, the\nlaws of the world unseen. And how can this great end be attained\nsave by the unfoldment from within, in whatsoever fashion it may be\npossible, of man's transcendental faculty ;\u2014by his recognition of\nhimself as a cosmic being and not a planetary, as not a body but a\nsoul 1 Surely even that special premonition which is sometimes spoken\nof as a thing of terror,\u2014the warning or the promise of earthly death,\u2014\nshould to the wise man sound as a friendly summons, and as a welcome\nhome. Let him remember the Vision which came to Socrates in the\nprison-house ;\u2014then, and then only, showing in an angel's similitude\nthe Providence which till that hour had been but as an impersonal and\ninvisible Voice ;\u2014but now the \" fair and white-robed woman \", while\nfriends offered escape from death, had already spoken of better hope\nthan this, and had given to Achilles' words a more sacred meaning,\u2014\n\" On the third day hence thou comest to Phthia's fertile shore.\"\n\f594 Report of the Hypnotic Committee for 1894-5.\nII.\nREPORT OF THE HYPNOTIC COMMITTEE FOR 1894-5.\nThe Committee comprises the following members :\u2014T. Barkworth,\nJ.P. ; A. W. Barrett, M.B., Chairman ; J. M. Bramwell, M.B. ;\nSt. George Lane-Fox; W. Leaf, Litt.D. ; G. F. Rogers, M.D. ;\nF. Podmore, M.A. ; G. A. Smith; C. L. Tuckey, M.D. ; A. Wallace,\nM.D. ; and E. Westlake, Secretary.\nFrom October 11th, 1894, to June 20th, 1895, 34 meetings were\nheld ; 30 at the Society's rooms, 3 at Finsbury-square, and 1 at\nHampstead. An average of four members attended at each meeting.\nThirty-six youths, all of whom stated that they had not been\npreviously hypnotised, came in reply to advertisements inserted in the\ndaily papers. Ten of these went away without having been tried. Of\nthe remaining 26, 18 were hypnotised, and 8 were unaffected, giving a\ntotal of 70 per cent. hypnotisable. Five were decidedly affected on\nthe first attempt, and others may have been ; in a few cases the\nhypnosis may have been slight. No strict tests were applied as to the\ndegree of hypnosis. The time was mainly occupied in testing for\nthought-transference, with results which could be judged of on their\nown merits, independently of any question as to the genuineness or\ndepth of the hypnosis.\nIt was observed that most if not all the subjects were primarily\nen rapport with all those present, but this condition was easily\nmodified subsequently by suggestion.\nExperiment* in thought-transference vrith a hypnotised subject.\nSixty-one experiments, with 7 operators and 14 subjects, were made\nin guessing playing-cards, the total of cards guessed being 1,173. In\neach experiment, a number of cards, varying from 4 to 52, or 20 on\nthe average, were guessed under practically uniform conditions.\nOf these experiments, 39 were made with one or more members of\nthe Committee as agents (one at least being en rapport with the\nsubject), and one subject as percipient at a time. Usually one member\nonly acted as operator and agent. Occasionally other members, who\nmight or might not be in rapport, would also look at the cards. When\na subject had been once hypnotised, he was sometimes woke and\nre-hypnotised by the next person about to act as agent; at other times\nthe subject was simply put in rapport with the next agent. A total\nof 817 cards were tried, out of which the subjects told correctly 214\n\fReport of the Hypnotic Committee for 1894-5. 595\nsuits, 79 pips, and 19 whole cards.1 The most probable number of\nsuccesses by chance would be 204, 63, and 16 respectively ; the\nnumbers required to prove some cause other than chance being 257,\n95, and 32 respectively.2\nIn four of these experiments, the agents were in contact with the\npercipients while they were guessing 47 cards. The percipients were\ncorrect in 7 suits, 4 pips, and 3 whole cards\u2014a higher result than\nin the guessing without contact. The number of cards tried is, how\never, too small to draw any conclusion from, and as it was desired to\navoid possible sources of error in the experiments, they were not\ncarried further in this direction.\nIn some experiments the card guessed coincided more often with\nthe preceding card (the one last looked at by the agent) than with the\none he was looking at at the time. Thinking that this might perhaps\npoint to the greater efficacy of sub-conscious suggestion, we have\nanalysed the experiments throughout from this point of view, and a\nsummary of the results is given in a foot-note to each group. The\nnumber of successes of this kind\u2014that is, of coincidence of the guess\nwith the card last looked at by the agent\u2014is, except in the last group,\nalways below the most probable number of successes by chance ;\nwhereas the number of real successes\u2014that is, coincidence of the guess\n* with the card looked at by the agent at the time\u2014is always above the\nmost probable number.3\nExperiments in thought-transference with two hypnotised subjects.\nThe remaining 22 experiments were made with two subjects ; the\noperator and one subject acting as agent, and the other subject as\npercipient.\n1 The number of successes in \"suits\" and in \"pips\" include the successes in\n\"whole cards,\" as well as those in \"suits\" or \"pips\" respectively. This is done\nfor convenience of comparison with the most probable number of successes by chance\nin each case.\n2 These are calculated from the formula given by Mr. Sanger in his analysis of\nMrs. Verrall's card experiments in Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXVIII., p. 193. As\nhe shows in his explanation of the method of calculation, the number of trials is\ninsufficient to base any definite conclusions on whenever the number of successes\nrequired to prove some cause other than chance is greater than twice the most\nprobable number of successes. It will be found that in the case of whole cards, any\nseries of less than 800 trials would be insufficient. The number of successes in whole\ncards necessary to prove some cause other than chance is therefore only given in the\ntwo series of 817 and 969.\n3 In the group of experiments already referred to\u2014in which the cards were\nguessed by one percipient at a time-out of a total of 778 preceding cards, 193 suits\ncoincided, 52 pips, and 12 whole cards. The most probable number of successes by\nchance would be 194, 6O, and 15 respectively. The successes were therefore in each\ncase below the most probable number. This, as far as it goes, tends to show that\nunconscious suggestion was inoperative, and to emphasise the results got in guessing\nthe cards looked at at the time.\n\f596 Report of the Hypnotic Committee for 1894-5.\nTwelve of these experiments were made without contact either\nbetween the subjects themselves or between them and the operator.\nThe subjects, having been hypnotised by some member of the Com\nmittee, were seated in chairs about a foot apart and turned either back\nto back or at an angle sufficient not to see one another. A card was\nthen drawn from a pack by the operator, or by another member of\nthe Committee, and placed upright on the sideboard under the south\nbookcase in the library at a height of about three feet from the floor.\nA large black book was usually placed behind the card to form a dark\nbackground. The card was then looked at intently by the operator\nand by one of the hypnotised subjects\u2014the two acting as agents. At\nthe same time the second subject, who was acting as percipient, and\nwho was turned the other way with eyes closed, was told that a card\nwas being looked at. In about a quarter of a minute the percipient\neither named a card of his own accord, or did so on being asked by the\noperator.\nThese twelve experiments comprised a total of 152 cards, out of\nwhich the percipient told correctly 45 suits, 8 pips, and 2 whole cards.\nThe most probable number of successes by chance would be 38, 12,\nand 3 respectively ; the numbers required to prove some cause other\nthan chance being 61 in suits and 26 in pips.\nSummarizing the two foregoing groups in which there was no\ncontact, we have a total of 51 experiments with 969 cards, out of\nwhich the percipients told correctly 259 suits, 87 pips, and 21 whole\ncards.1 The most probable number of successes by chance would be\n242, 75, and 19 respectively; the numbers required to prove some\ncause other than chance being 299, 110, and 37 respectively.\nTen similar experiments were also made in which the subjects were\nin contact with one another and with the operator, usually with joined\nhands, the other arrangements being as before described. The usual\nform of contact was as follows :\u2014The subject-percipient's left hand\nwas placed on the operator-agent's knee ; the subject-agent placed his\nright hand on the subject-percipient's hand, and the operator-agent\nplaced his hand on the top of both. Sometimes the operator held the\nsubject's joined hands in both of his. In the first experiments the\nsubject-agent's right hand was simply placed on the subject-percipient's\nleft arm.\nThese experiments include a total of 204 cards, out of which the\npercipient told correctly 56 suits, 84 pips, and 16 whole cards. The\nmost probable number of successes by chance would be 51, 16, and 4\n1 Out of a total of 919 preceding cards, 222 suits were told correctly, 61 pips, and\n16 whole cards. The most probable number of successes by chance would be 230, 71,\nand 18 respectively. The successes were thus in all cases below chance.\n\fReport of the Hypnotic Committee for 1894-5. 597\nrespectively ; the number required to prove some cause other than\nchance being 77 in suits and 32 in pips.1\nNo code or ordinary process of communication was detected on any\noccasion. In view, however, of (a) the excess in pips being about\n4 times that in suits, (6) the immediate falling off of the results\nwhenever contact was broken, and (c) the proved hyperesthesia of\nthe subject on several occasions, it seems probable that indications\nmay have been given (perhaps unconsciously on one or both sides)\nof a normal nature, such as movements or muscular pressures so slight\nas to have escaped the notice of the experimenters.\nThe experience, therefore, of the Committee with reference to\nthought-transference between the operator and subject, or between the\nhypnotised subjects, is as yet negative. Although the results in several\nof the series exceeded the most probable number of successes by chance,\nthe excess was not very great, and the successes in every case fell short\nof the numbers required to prove some cause other than chance, with\nthe single exception of the pips in the series of 204 trials just men\ntioned, where contact was used.\nThere may, however, be some significance in the fact that the\ncoincidence of the guesses with the \" preceding cards \" was invariably\n\u2014when no contact was used\u2014below the most probable number of\ncoincidences by chance. This seems at least to strengthen the proba\nbility that the actual successes obtained were not all due to chance.\nExperiments with Miss Maud Lancaster.\nDuring the month of June, Miss Maud Lancaster, a professional\nthought-reader and discoverer of hidden articles and stolen property,\nattended on three occasions. The experiments took usually the\nfollowing form :\u2014\nA situation simple in character and dramatic in action, such as a\nmurder or a theft, was rehearsed in Miss Lancaster's absence by the\nCommittee. She then entered the room, was blindfolded, and was told\nthe general nature of the scene. Then stretching out her hands as\nthough feeling in the air, and touching the sitters slightly, she\nidentified the actors and the parts taken by them.\nThe experiments were also varied thus :\u2014A member of the\nCommittee in the sight of his colleagues and in Miss Lancaster's\nabsence, touched a certain point in the room for a few seconds, which\nMiss Lancaster, on being blindfolded, and again introduced, speedily\n1 Out of 194 preceding cards, 60 suits were told correctly, 21 pips, and 4 whole\ncards. The most probable number of successes by chance would be 49, 15, and 4\nrespectively ; the numbers required to prove some cause other than chance being\n74 in suits and 31 in pips.\n\f598 Report of the Hypnotic Committee for 1894-5.\nidentified. She was not in contact with any one who knew what the\nspot was during any part of the time that she was searching for it.\nThe Committee were impressed throughout these experiments by\nthe possibility that Miss Lancaster may have been able to tell from\nthe movements of the sitters whether they approved of her doings.\nSuccess was attained by her only after she had made a variety of\ntentative muscular movements, and had felt the sitters\u2014when\nrequired to identify them. To some of them, at any rate, it seemed\nthat when they were concentrating their thoughts upon the action\nsought for, they might by some sound, by their breathing, or by their\nmovements when touched, have given her indications, although their\nuntrained senses failed to notice it.\nThis conclusion seems warranted by the fact that when Miss\nLancaster was restricted from making muscular movements on her\nown account, as when she was set to name a card known only to one\nor more members of the Committee, she invariably failed.\nMoreover, when she attempted to find a hidden coin, the situation\nof which was known to one only of the Committee, she succeeded\nonly in one out of six trials.\nThis agrees with her own statement that she succeeds best with\nher experiments in the presence of large audiences.\nBefore admitting that thought-transference is operative in her\nexperiments, further investigation is required.\n\fSupplement. 599\nReview.\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEW.\nVHypothise du Magnitisme Animal. By E. Boirac (Nouvelle Revue,\n' October, 1895).\nIn the October number of the NouveUe Revue, M. Boirac has published\nsome interesting and important observations on effects produced by himself\nas hypnotic agent without contact with his subject. They are confined to\nphenomena of apparent attraction produced by movements of his hands on\nthe limbs of the patient. The following abridged account may serve as a\ntype. The subject in this case is a boy of 15, from the Pyrenees, who was in\nM. Boirac's service for six months.\n\"One Sunday afternoon in January, 1893, coming in at 3 o'clock, I found\nthat Jean had gone to lie down. I found him asleep on his back on his bed.\nStanding by the door, at a distance of three metres, I stretched out my hand\ntowards and on a level with his feet. After a minute or two, perhaps loss, I\nJ raised my hand, and, to my amazement, saw his legs rise from the bed and\nfoBow the upward movement of my hand. This was repeated three times\nwith absolute regularity. I called Mme. B., and in her presence repeated\nthe experiment two or three times. Mme. B. suggested to me to try the\neffect of simple thought. I fixed my eyes on his feet, and slowly raised them.\nThe feet followed the movements of my eyes, rising, stopping, and falling\nwith them. Mme. B. took my left hand and with her other did as I had\ndone. She succeeded, like myself ; but as soon as she ceased to touch me,\nshe produced no effects. \"\nWith another subject, Gustave P., similar results were obtained, namely,\nattraction of his limbs by movements of the right hand, under circumstances\nwhich, in M. Boirac's opinion, were sufficient to exclude the hypothesis of\nhyperesthesia as well as of normal vision and verbal suggestion. But in this\ncase, when the left hand was used, instead of attraction or repulsion, the\nsubject said that he felt a violent pricking in the limb pointed at ; when both\nhands were used together, he complained of a \"muddle\" (cj&chis) of the two\nsensations. With the aid of a friend, M. Boirac tried the effect of a copper\nwire, of which he held one bare end, while the other, wrapped round a\nwooden ruler, was presented by his colleague to the subject's body. The\neffect was the same as that of the hand itself, while M. 'Boirac remained in\nthe room and could see what was going on ; but when he tried from the next\nroom, with the door closed between, the characteristic symptoms seem to\nhave given place to a general feeling of malaise and heaviness in the head.\nOn repeating with the earlier subject, Jean, the experiments thus suggested,\nit was found that there was no difference in the action of the right and left\nhands ; both alike produced attraction.\n\f600 ISupplement\nReview.\nM. Boirac is to be congratulated on his good fortune in having hit upon\nsubjects showing this high degree of sensitiveness. We wish we could, from\nexperience, confirm his conviction that \"any one who tries experiments in\nsimilar conditions \" will be able to verify them. We can assure him that it\nis not from want of patience in searching for suitable subjects that the\nHypnotic Committee of the Society have failed in witnessing even remotely\nsimilar results.\nWhen we come to the interpretation of these experiments, we are sorry to\nfind ourselves at issue with ML Boirac. He regards them as pointing to\n\"Animal Magnetism\" as distinct from suggestion. If he means to exclude\nfrom suggestion what we in England call \"Thought-transference \" and\nContinental observers \" Mental Suggestion,\" he is probably right ; though I\nam not entirely satisfied that the conditions of the experiments, which are\nvery imperfectly recorded, are such as to exclude the possibility of \" mind\nreading \" by hyperesthesia. Still, assuming that this possibility has been\nsuccessfully excluded, I do not see that M. Boirac is justified, much less\ncompelled, to have recourse to the term \"Animal Magnetism.\" That has been\ndiscarded on the ground that it suggests all sorts of false, or at least highly\nimprobable, analogies ; and it seems clear that M. Boirac has allowed himself\nto be misled in this very way. It is true that he does not clearly say what he\nmeans by \"Animal Magnetism,\" but such phrases as \"le rayonnement\nmagnetiquo ou uerveux \" raise a very strong suspicion that he looks upon the\ndynamic agency concerned as a physical force, with spatial relations and\nactually analogous to the physical magnetism with which we are acquainted. ^\nWe know far too little to say that it is not so ; but I am not aware of any\nexperiments which tend to prove it, and M. Boirac's seem to me to go certainly\nagainst it. The mere fact that he obtained phenomena of \" attraction \" is\nsurely the most superficial of analogies, when we think of the imitativeness\nwhich is one of the commonest features of deep hypnotic trance. In one case,\nM. Boirac got a sort of polarity bet.veen his hands, but his attempt to verify\nthis on another subject proved that it was not a property of any force\nemanating from himself, but a result of some subconscious interpretation in\nthe mind of the subject. The experiments with the copper wire, if they\nprove anything, show that the force cannot be conducted from one room to\nanother like electricity. And finally, I venture to suggest that if M. Boirac\nwishes to get the ear of men of science, it can only be done by the pub\nlication of exact observations, such as the classical experiments of Gurney.\nM. Boirac may have kept an equally exact record ; if so, it should certainly t\nbe published. But the present article shews no trace of the careful control\nexperiments which might have been suggested in abundance by perusal of the\nwork of the S. P.R. in England, or of Moll in Germany ; and while these are\nabsent, one cannot feel that any substantial advance is likely to come from\npopular publication,\nWalter Leaf.\n\fEdmund Gumey Library. 601\nEDMUND GURNEY LIBRARY.\nSUPPLEMENTARY CATALOGUE, 1895.\nAdditions since the list in \"Proceedings,\" Vol. X.\nPodmobe (Frank, M.A.), Apparitions and Thought-transference :\nAn Examination of the Evidence for Telepathy.
