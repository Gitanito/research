She married there, to a railway network director.\n\nGoldney moved to England in 1933 and undertook training in midwifery at Queen Charlotte\u2019s Hospital. She was a Regional Commissioner in the Women's Voluntary Services and was subsequently awarded the MBE for her work there.\n\nGoldney spoke fluent German and was an accomplished pianist.   Psychical Research\n\nGoldney joined the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1927, having become intrigued with Indian firewalking. She joined its governing council in 1942, served as its secretary from 1949 to1957 and was later appointed a vice-president.\n\nIn addition to her work in the SPR, Goldney worked with Harry Price at his National Laboratory of Psychical Research, assisting with the investigation of such mediums as Rudi Schneider and Helen Duncan, whose trial for witchcraft she attended.\n\nLater she collaborated with Eric Dingwall and Trevor Hall on a critical report of Price\u2019s Borley Rectory investigation.1\n\nWith RG Medhurst, Goldney authored a historical examination of William Crookes\u2019s investigations of Florence Cook and other mediums, defending them against charges of experimental incompetence and gullibility.2 &nbsp;  Soal-Goldney Experiments\n\nGoldney assisted SG Soal in telepathy experiments in 1941-1943 with Basil Shackleton, whose unusually high success rate was later shown to have been achieved by Soal\u2019s covert manipulation of the data. Goldney was not implicated in the deception.3\n\nShe took an interest in telepathy experiments later carried out by Soal with two Welsh boys, investigating claims by a sceptical psychologist that the boys might have signalled by means of an ultrasonic whistle inaudible to adults.4  Works  Books\n\nCrookes and the Spirit World (1972, with RG Medhurst and MR Barrington).
