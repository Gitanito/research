He has been Thorsen Professor of Psychology at the University of Lund Department of Psychology since 2005. Carde\u00f1a is also active in the field of parapsychology, with research interests in shamanism, spirit possession, the influence of altered states on psi performance, and other topics. He has also served the field as an organizational leader, editor and advocate.

His interest in parapsychology was nurtured by both parents, who followed the work of JB Rhine and other researchers of the era. His father was a psychoanalyst, setting the scene for Etzel\u2019s mainstream interests; he also conducted and wrote about his own informal psi research, which Etzel witnessed.1 Carde\u00f1a said in an interview that he was particularly impressed by \u2018a friend of the family who had an uncanny ability to diagnose precisely someone whose name had just been given to her\u2019.2\n\nIn 1981, Carde\u00f1a was granted his license in clinical psychology with highest honours from the prestigious Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. In 1982\u201383, he interned at Wellesley Hospital in Toronto.\n\nIn 1983, he earned one MA in clinical psychology at York University in Toronto, then a second MA and his PhD in personality psychology (supervised by Charles Tart) at the University of California, Davis (in 1985 and 1988 respectively).3\n\nWhile working on his dissertation, he was encouraged by Tart to take an intense summer learning program at the Rhine Research Center (at that time named the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man). Here, he solidified his knowledge of past and ongoing parapsychological research. He also participated in experiments in which he showed some indication of ability in psychokinesis and as a receiver in ganzfeld experiments.4\n\nHe spent the summer of 1990 at Ohio State University as a faculty fellow in psychophysiology, and 1988\u201391 as a postdoctoral fellow and visiting scholar at Stanford.\n\nIn 2019, he took a course from Copenhagen University in the emerging technique of non-invasive transcranial brain stimulation.5 However, his plans to use this in psychokinesis experiments are on hold due to Covid-19.  Career\n\nCarde\u00f1a has held the endowed position Thorsen Professor of Psychology at the University of Lund Department of Psychology since 2005. The duties of the post include research on parapsychology and hypnosis.6\n\nHe also heads the Center for Research on Consciousness and Anomalous Psychology (CERCAP), a group of researchers focusing on anomalous experiences, the neurophenomenology of hypnotic phenomena, high hypnotizability and dissociation, the relation between hypnotizability and performance in psi tasks, and dissociative reactions to trauma.7\n\nHe has served as a professor, associate professor, visiting professor or adjunct at the National Center for Disaster Psychiatry, Uppsala University Hospital (Sweden); Catholic University of Valencia (Spain); Department of Psychology and Anthropology (of which he was Department Chair) and Department of Drama (of which he was Artist-in-Residence), University of Texas-Pan American; Trinity College; Pacific Graduate School of Psychology; Universidad Complutense de Madrid; Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia; University of California, Davis; and several other institutions. He worked at Mexico\u2019s Centros de Integraci\u00f3n Juvenil as a clinical psychologist from September 1978 to March 1980.\n\nCarde\u00f1a has presented at innumerable conferences, served as a peer reviewer for many publications, written reviews of innumerable books and some films, translated abstracts, and supervised many students through their masters and doctorates in psychology. A recipient of several BIAL Foundation grants, he also consults with the Foundation on future meetings and research grants.\n\nHe has served as a consultant on updates to the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the authoritative guide to mental illness diagnosis in much of the world.\n\nCarde\u00f1a has served as editor, guest editor, associate editor and member of editorial boards for many publications, mostly psychological. Most notably in the parapsychology field, he was editor of the Journal of Parapsychology from 2017 to 2020, and preceding that, founding editor of Mindfield: The Bulletin of the Parapsychological Association from 2009 to 2017. During the same period, he served as associate editor for the Journal for Scientific Exploration. He recently launched the open-access, university-based Journal of Anomalous Experience and Cognition.\n\nCarde\u00f1a\u2019s research has been covered in various mainstream media including the New York Times, USA Today, Newsweek, New Yorker magazine, the BBC, The Learning Channel, The Guardian, and Science News.8  Theatre\n\nCarde\u00f1a has a strong side interest in theatre, having worked professionally as an actor, director, and playwright from his time in Mexico to the present. He has been the Artistic Director for the International Theatre of Malm\u00f6 and many of his radio play adaptations are archived in M\u00e9xico National University\u2019s Descarga Cultura.  Parapsychological Research\n\nCarde\u00f1a considers parapsychology to be a natural part of psychology, as anomalous experiences and altered states of consciousness are by definition aspects of consciousness. The importance of parapsychology, he argues, is in questioning the limitations of consciousness that are assumed in materialistic-reductionist models; in agreeing with \u2018a model of a unified continuous aspect of reality\u2019 suggested by some interpretations of quantum mechanics; and finally, in exploring what light the link between ASCs and psi sheds on the nature of consciousness.9\n\nCarde\u00f1a\u2019s major area of interest in parapsychology is factors that can affect performance in psi tasks, particularly hypnotizability, dissociation and ASCs, using the ganzfeld protocol.  Ganzfeld Telepathy\n\nIn 2011, Carde\u00f1a co-published with his graduate student David Marcusson-Clavertz a paper10 hypothesizing that ganzfeld scores would be positively affected by three factors \u2013 belief that one will succeed, reported past psi experiences, and high hypnotizability \u2013 and also that dissociation would moderate the effect of hypnotizability, and alterations in consciousness would be significantly related both to hypnotizability and performance in the task.\n\nPercipient expectation of individual success did moderately correlate with high scoring, as did percipient reporting of prior psi experiences; however, when other factors were controlled for, it was low hypnotizability rather than high that correlated with high psi scores.&nbsp;There was no effect of dissociation on hypnotizability\u2019s effect on scores.\n\nMost notably, there was a strong correlation between experiencing an altered state during the test and high scores for high hypnotizables. The authors write: \u2018Generally, our results may be the clearest evidence until now of a relationship between experiencing an altered state of consciousness and psi-hitting, but only for the select group of high hypnotizables, who are the people more likely to experience such alterations\u2019.11\n\nA successful replication was carried out using only highly hypnotizable subjects, with a larger sample, finding a moderate correlation.12  Other Research\n\nCarde\u00f1a has also studied various aspects of shamanism (including how its practices compare with hypnotism), spirit possession, the relationship between art and psi, the relationship between dissociation, suggestibility and anomalous experiences, meditation and anomalous experiences, the relation between body position and out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, comparing Brazilian Spiritist mediumship and dissociative identity disorder, testing a professional medium, and other anomalous phenomena.13\n\nResearch planned by Carde\u00f1a as of this writing includes using functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity of a subject performing automatic writing and high hypnotizables who can experience automatic writing, as well as subjects undergoing mystical experiences. He also plans to continue researching the ingredients of successful ganzfield sessions by analyzing their content.14  Advocacy\n\nCarde\u00f1a notes the negative influence of sceptic campaigns against parapsychology, decrying their \u2018wrathful and prejudiced intolerance\u2019.  \n\nThe anti-parapsychology movement has been very effective so far in marginalizing the field and exerted a very high cost on those who want to work in the field, with the main exception of Great Britain. The result is that there are preciously few researchers and theoreticians working in the area.15\n\nTo counter this, Carde\u00f1a has expended much effort to try to bring parapsychology into mainstream science by placing parapsychological research papers in mainstream journals and books (see list below), by presenting overviews of the evidence for psi, and by engaging in lively debate with detractors.  Varieties of Anomalous Experience\n\nIn 2000, Carde\u00f1a collaborated with Steven Jay Lynn and Stanley Krippner on a book published by the American Psychological Association, Varieties of Anomalous Experience: Examining the Scientific Evidence (now available on archive.org).16 &nbsp;\u2018Thousands of psychologists on this continent are members, receiving the APA\u2019s journals and publication catalogs\u2019, writes Leonard George in a review.17\n\nThe first of two sections discusses methodological concerns, notably the difficulty of trying to gather introspective data that mostly cannot be produced on demand. The second contains chapters titled \u2018Hallucinatory Experiences\u2019 (by Richard Bentall), \u2018Synaesthesia\u2019 (Lawrence E Marks), \u2018Lucid Dreaming\u2019&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen LaBerge and Jayne Gackenbach), \u2018Out-of-Body Experiences\u2019 (Carlos Alvarado), \u2018Psi-Related Experiences\u2019 (Elisabeth Targ, Marilyn Schlitz, and Harvey J Irwin), \u2018Alien Abduction Experiences\u2019 (Stuart Appelle, Steven Jay Lynn, and Leonard Newman), \u2018Past Life Experiences\u2019 (Antonia Mills and Steven Jay Lynn), \u2018Near-Death Experiences\u2019 (Bruce Greyson), \u2018Anomalous Healing\u2019 (Stanley Krippner) and \u2018Mystical Experience\u2019 (David M Wulff).\n\nIn 2014, Carde\u00f1a, Lynn and Krippner edited the second edition of Varieties of Anomalous Experience,18 a fourteen-year update to the first. It has the same structure, and many of the same authors returned with then-state-of-the-art overviews of their specialties. New authors include Ian Stevenson\u2019s successor Jim B Tucker on past-life experiences.&nbsp;In addition to co-editing, Carde\u00f1a wrote or co-wrote two chapters for the first edition of Varieties and four for the second.  Eminent Scientists\n\nIn 2013, Carde\u00f1a published a list of deceased eminent scientists, along with seminal figures in the the arts and humanities, who engaged in or supported parapsychological research. His aim was to make \u2018it easier for faculty who are given the spiel that parapsychology is pseudoscience and that no \u201creal\u201d scientists take it seriously\u2019.19 The list includes Einstein, Freud, Bell, Marie and Pierre Curie, more than thirty Nobel laureates including those still living, and hundreds of other pre-eminent people.20\n\nAn updated version of the article can be read in the Psi Encyclopedia.\n\n\u2018To give some cover to those who want to work in the field\u2019,21 Carde\u00f1a co-organized a \u2018call for an open, informed study of all aspects of consciousness\u2019 which was published in a mainstream journal in 2014.22 Though he is cited as the sole author, it was also signed by one hundred&nbsp;additional current or past academic notables in the parapsychology field. It was reprinted in Network Review23 and also translated into German and Russian.  Handbook\n\nIn 2015, Carde\u00f1a, John Palmer and Marcusson-Clavertz co-edited Parapsychology: A Handbook for the 21st Century,24 placing it with a mainstream commercial publisher. As described in a review by Caroline Watt, the volume is a successor to the 1977 Handbook of Parapsychology,25 with top specialists in many branches updating the work in their fields, to create \u2018a comprehensive&nbsp;guide to the last few decades of endeavour in parapsychology\u2019. Chapters and authors are summarized in Watt\u2019s review.26  American Psychologist Article\n\nIn 2018, the American Psychologist, the flagship publication of the APA, published a paper by Carde\u00f1a which summarized the evidence produced by experimental parapsychology.27 In the abstract, he restates the point he has made in many other works, that the evidence for psi is \u2018comparable to that for established phenomena in psychology and other disciplines\u2019,28 and substantiates it through the presentation of several parapsychological meta-analyses. He also rebuts common complaints by critics with regard to replicability, small effects and purported poor methodological quality.  Works\n\nCarde\u00f1a has written, co-written, edited and presented about four hundred books, papers and book chapters. A full list of citations can be found on Google Scholar here.
