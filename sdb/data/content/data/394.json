Horsell, Asst.-Secretar}^\r\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read and signed as\r\ncorrect. Fifteen new Members and two Student-Associates were elected ; their names and addresses are given above.\r\nThe 420th Meeting of the Council was held at 31 Tavistock Square,\r\nLondon, W.C. i, at 4\r\np.m. The President in the Chair. There were also\r\npresent: Miss Bosanquet, Mrs Oliver Gatty, Mrs Goldney, Mrs Heywood, Lord Charles Hope, the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E.,\r\nMr W. H. Salter, Dr S. G. Soal and Admiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt ; also\r\nMr West, Research Officer, and Miss E. M. Horsell, Asst.-Secretary.\r\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read and signed\r\nas correct. Seventeen new Members and' one Student-Associate were elected ; their names and addresses are given above.\r\nPRIVATE MEETINGS\r\nThe 190th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library on\r\nSaturday, 9 November 1946, at 3.30 p.m. The President in the Chair.\r\nA paper entitled \" Emanuel Swedenborg : His Life in Two Worlds \" was\r\nread by Dr E. J. Dingwall.\r\nThe 191st Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library on\r\nSaturday, 30 November 1946, at 3.30 p.m. The President in the Chair.\r\nA paper entitled \" The Psi Processes in Normal and Paranormal Psychology \" by Dr R. H. Thouless and Dr B. P. Wiesner was read.\r\nThe 192nd Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library on\r\nThursday, 9 January 1947, at 6.45 p.m., when Mr D. A.- H. Parsons\r\nread a paper on \"A Critical Review of the Published Work on PsychoKinesis\".\r\n4 * Jourfial of Society for Psychical Research ^an.-feb. 1947\r\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1946\r\n1 . Once again the Council are pleased to be\" able to record a very\r\nsubstantial increase in membership of the Society.\r\n2. Research Officer. In May the Council appointed Mr D. J. West\r\nResearch Officer of the Society, with effect from midsummer. Mr West,\r\nwhose work in connection with various branches of research, and also with\r\nthe editorship of the Combined Index for Proceedings and Journal, is well\r\nknown to our members, will devote his full time to the S.P.R. as soon as\r\nhis medical studies are completed. Since his appointment Mr West has\r\nbeen actively engaged in all kinds of research coming within the scope of an Officer of the Society. He is now in residence in the upper part of\r\n31 Tavistock Square. It is hpped that his appointment may help to promote\r\na greater activity in research than has been possible until recently, and\r\nthat in this policy all our members will heartily co-operate.\r\n3. Report of Research Officer. In the field of experimental E.S.P., efforts have been mainly directed towards securing a successful percipient.\r\nVarious subjects have been tested with cards and drawings. Advertisements\r\nhave been inserted in the Press asking for persons confident of their tele- pathic powers. A group of members interested in this work has been\r\nmeeting on Tuesday evenings for the purpose of testing likely subjects.\r\nSo far no positive results have been obtained.\r\nA group telepathic experiment with drawings was carried out in July,\r\nbut no evidence of paranormal faculty was found. A mass experiment with\r\ndrawings was performed on December ist, but the results are not yet known.\r\nMediumistic research has been restricted by the difficulty in procuring\r\nthe services of a satisfactory medium. About a dozen mediums have\r\nallowed themselves to be tested (including a direct voice medium), but\r\nwith one slight exception they gave no evidence of paranormality.\r\nExperiments in psychometry with absent sitters are in progress, Mr\r\nJohn Mayes acting as medium. Each person whose object or letter is \" psychometrised \" is given five readings to annotate, without being told\r\nwhich one was intended for them. In this way it is possible to obtain an\r\nobjective statistical check on the individual appropriateness of the psychometric readings. The results so far have been promising.\r\nCases of spontaneous psychic occurrences have been reported with\r\nslightly increasing frequency. They are all followed up as far as circumstances permit. Although most of them have points of interest, only a small\r\nproportion reach the evidential standard desirable for printing in the\r\nJournal. Some interesting cases of haunting have been investigated. The\r\nCouncil wish to thank several members of the Society for reporting\r\nspontaneous cases or for assisting in their investigation.\r\nInquiries have been initiated into the subjects of paranormal healing\r\nand the Society has been fortunate in securing the co-operation of Mr\r\nHarry Edwards, the well-known psychic healer.\r\nThe Working Group, which is open to all members wishing to take part\r\nin current activities, was re-formed in May, and has been meeting regularly on alternate Thursdays at 6.45 p.m. Meetings of the Group have so far been devoted to informal discussions, talks, telepathy experiments, sittings\r\nwith mediums and demonstrations by a hypnotist and a dowser.\r\nJAN.-FEB. 1947 Annual Report for 1946 5\r\nOwing to limitations of printing, it is not possible to give a full report of\r\nall the investigations carried out by the Society, many of which yield\r\ninconclusive or negative results, but any member wishing further in- formation may, on application, consult some of the detailed accounts\r\ncontained in the Research file.\r\n4. Psycho-kinesis. About a year ago Mr Whately Carington began a\r\nseries of experiments in psycho-kinesis. This subject involves problems\r\nlikely to be of great importance to the Society's work, inasmuch as the\r\nrelation of mental and physical factors appears to be closer than could be\r\ndemonstrated in any other phenomena. Mr Carington is at the same time\r\nengaged on a study of the theoretical aspects of the phenomena which it is hoped will ultimately be published in book form. To enable him to carry on this important work the Council have made him a grant of f^zoo for\r\nthe year.\r\nThe Research Officer and others have been unsuccessful in their\r\nattempts to reproduce Rhine's dice-throwing effects. Mr D. H. Hyde and\r\nMr Denys' Parsons, who both reported some experiments in Proceedings,\r\nhave completed further series with chance results.\r\n5. Publicity. The Pamphlet issued by the Society towards the end of\r\n1945 and mentioned in the last Annual Report has promoted knowledge\r\nof the Society's work in the Press and among the public generally. In\r\nconsequence of favourable notices of the Pamphlet in the Observer for\r\nAugust loth, and in the Guardian and Nature, there was so great a popular\r\ndemand for it that the first issue was rapidly exhausted and a second issue\r\nof 1,000 was printed. This reprint has also sold well. Encouraged by the success of the original Pamphlet the Council are making arrangements for the printing of other pamphlets of about the same size, which will deal rather more fully with particular aspects of the\r\nSociety's history and work. It will be made clear in each of the new\r\npamphlets that while it is issued with the Council's approval, the author\r\nalone is responsible for any opinions expressed in it. The Council receives frequent requests from persons up and down the\r\ncountry to provide lecturers, and these requests are as far as is practicable\r\nmet by sending down some speaker with knowledge of the subject. They\r\nregret that distance, and the many duties that Officers of the Society have\r\nto perform, sometimes make it impossible to comply with these requests.\r\n6. The Questionnaire. The Council wish to express their cordial thanks\r\nto 196 members who were good enough to answer the Questionnaire issued\r\nin February. Mr Parsons and Mrs Sendall have analysed the results for\r\nthe Council and a brief summary of the analysis appears in the Journal\r\nfor December. The Council welcome the suggestions made by members\r\nfor the conduct of the Society's business, several of which they hope to be\r\nable to carry into eftect. The replies to the Questionnaire showed that\r\nthere were many members of the Society who would be glad of advice as\r\nto the conduct of sittings with different types of mediums, and as to the\r\nappreciation and assessment of the results obtained. To meet the wishes\r\nof such members the Council appointed a Committee of persons with\r\nconsiderable experience of sittings, who have drawn up some \" Hints \" as\r\nto the conduct and evaluation of sittings, of which copies can be obtained on request.\r\n6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1947\r\n7. Presidency. Mr Tyrrell was re-elected President of the Society for a second term of office. On October 8th he delivered an Address, \" The\r\nModus Operandi in Paranormal Cognition \", which will shortly be\r\npublished in Proceedings.\r\n8. Endowment Fund. Professor Dodds has been appointed a trustee of\r\nthis Fund in place of the late Mr H. F. Saltmarsh.\r\n9. Donations. The Council wish to acknowledge with the warmest\r\nthanks several donations which have been particularly welcome at a time\r\nwhen all-round increases in costs make the balancing of the Society's\r\nbudget difficult. They wish to make special mention of a most generous\r\ngift of \u00a31,000 from Lord Rayleigh, a former President, and also two\r\ndonations, already acknowledged in the Journal, from American members.\r\n10. Proceedings and Journal. Mrs Salter, who has edited the Proceedings\r\nfor thirty years, for the first few years as Editor but for most of the time as Hon. Editor, having expressed a wish to be relieved of these duties,\r\nMr Tyrrell kindly consented to add the duties of Hon. Editor to those of\r\nPresident. The Council wish to take this opportunity of thanking Mrs\r\nSalter very cordially for her long services.\r\nThe Editorship of the Journal having become vacant through Mr Richmond's death, the Hon.' Secretary agreed to act as Hon. Editor of the\r\nJournal for the time being.\r\n11. Discussion Meetings. As announced in the Journal it is intended\r\nthat during 1947 Discussion Meetings should be held regularly on the\r\nfirst Thursday of every month, and that some of the meetings should be\r\ndevoted to an account of the past work of the Society in various lines. It\r\nis thought that talks of this kind might be helpful to the large number of\r\nnew members of the Society who are not already familiar with the Society's\r\nhistory, and who in consequence find some difficulty in following reports\r\nof research which though recent in time has its roots in past work.\r\n12. Foreign Members. News continues to be received from various parts\r\nof Europe of members of the Society with whom the Society has perforce\r\nbeen out of touch during the years of the war. Every eftort is being made\r\nto establish contact with such members arid to co-operate with them in\r\nresearch wherever practicable, but there are still parts of the Continent to which it is not at present possible to forward the Society's Proceedings and\r\nJournal.\r\n' 13. Memorial to Kenneth Richmond. A Committee was formed to organise the purchase of books in memory of Kenneth Richmond, from\r\nfunds subscribed by members and friends. The members of the Committee are the President, Mrs Richmond, the Hon. Mrs C. H. Gay and Mr D.\r\nParsons. A shelf in the Library has been set aside and an engraved plate\r\nwill be affixed. It was decided that it would be appropriate to choose such\r\nbooks as would help to make up the Library's deficiency in works on\r\npsychology and philosophy. A number have been put on order.\r\n14. Library. During the year 835 books were borrowed by Members\r\nand 74 books were borrowed by the National Central Library for Students.\r\n15. Membership of the Society. 109 new Members and 10 StudentAssociates were elected. The total loss from deaths, resignations, etc., is 28, leaving a net increase of 91 in the total membership, which now\r\nstands at 764. Among the losses by death the Council regret to record\r\nJAN.-FEB. 1947 Annual Report for 1946 7\r\nthe name of Professor W. Macneile Dixon, a member of long standing,\r\nand for some years a member of Council.\r\n16. Publications. Two parts of Proceedings were published during the\r\nyear, the App. to Part 171 and Part 172.\r\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to 12 4\r\nand to members of the Society ^'j'j o 9 ; and ^59 2 o to members and\r\nthe public through the Society's agent in the United States.\r\n17.

Robertson\r\nIn the discussion given here on the possibility of a relation between tele- pathic phenomena and electromagnetic radiation it will be assumed as an\r\nempirical fact of observation that the transmission of impressions and\r\nthoughts from one mind to another can occur in some manner which has\r\nnot yet been related to ordinary sensory perception, although this question\r\nmight still be regarded as controversial.\r\nSir William Crookes in his presidential address to the Society for\r\nPsychical Research in 1897 made the provisional suggestion that electromagnetic radiation from one brain to another might be a possible mode\r\nof telepathic action. In more recent discussions of telepathy, however, any\r\n.8 - ' Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN.-FEB. 1947\r\nsuch possiblity has been dismissed in somewhat definite terms. Thus\r\nW. W. Carington (i) considers telepathy to be a phenomenon outside the\r\nphysical world of matter and energy, and he strongly emphasises the impossibility of it having anything whatever to do with wireless at all or any\r\nother sort of radiation phenomena. Again S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney\r\n(2) remark that adoption of Bergson's theory of memory precludes any\r\nview regarding the telepathic process as a transmission from one brain to another after physical models like electric waves. In support of views of this kind a number of arguments are usually advanced. Thus the intensity of uniformly radiating energy diminishes with\r\nincreasing distance from the source of radiation according to the inverse\r\nsquare law, whereas telepathic communication does not seem to diminish\r\nin the same way. Hence it is argued that telepathy is not associated with\r\nradiant energy. Another difficulty raised against a physical theory is that a code is normally required in transmitting thoughts. In broadcasting, for\r\nexample, the ordinary code of speech, or a morse code miy be used. The\r\nidea of some special coding mechanism in the brain for telepathic trans- mission is considered unreasonable. The question of how a telepathic\r\nmessage reaches the right percipient is frequently raised as a difficulty for\r\nphysical theories. More recently precognition is supposed by some investigators to have finally eliminated the possibility of physical theories.\r\nSometimes experiments on the screening of telepathic subjects are quoted\r\nas evidence against radiation theories.\r\nIt seems possible, however, to express some doubts as to whether these\r\narguments against the possibility of the telepathic process involving the use\r\nof electromagnetic waves do in fact finally settle the question. A number of\r\nobservations might be made in connection with the inverse square law.\r\nWhen it is argued that a radiative theory of telepathy requires a diminution\r\nof telepathic influence with increasing distance, the assumption is made that\r\nthe intensity of the radiation incident on the brain of the percipient is the\r\npredominating factor in stimulating the appropriate telepathic image.\r\nNow a number of physical and biological systems are known where an\r\neffect produced by a certain stimulus does not depend on the size of that\r\nstimulus within very wide limits, provided that it is above a certain\r\nthreshold value. Thus when a single nerve fibre is stimulated the magnitude of the resultant electrical disturbance transmitted along the fibre is independent of the size of the stimulus in this way. Again the energy of\r\nelectrons emitted from a metal exposed to suitable electromagnetic\r\nradiation depends on the frequency of the radiation and not on its intensity.\r\nThis question of telepathy and the inverse square law has been discussed\r\nby B. Hoffmann (3) who considers that the usual arguments against\r\nradiation theories confuse intensity with intelligibility, and goes on to give some examples where a decline in the intensity of radiation according to the inverse square law is not accompanied by any decline in intelligibility.\r\nThe possiblity might also be considered of a receptor mechanism having a response proportional to the logarithm of the magnitude of the stimulus.\r\nThen very large changes in radiation intensity could produce very muchsmaller changes in the size of the response. Finally doubts might perhaps\r\nbe expressed from the experimental viewpoint as to the strength of the\r\nevidence from which it is concluded that telepathic effects do not decline\r\nJAN.-FEB. 1947 Telepathy atid Electromagnetic Waves gf\r\nwith distance. J. B. Rhine (4) in some earlier experiments observed a disappearance of telepathy with several subjects with increasing distance,\r\nbut it is not clear to what extent this was a psychological phenomenon.\r\nOther subjects continued to obtain very high scores with increasing dis- tance. Very high scores of this kind have not, however, been maintained\r\nas the telepathy experiments have become more rigorous, a feature which\r\nmight suggest the possibility of some defects in the earlier experiments.\r\nThe necessity for a code in telepathic transmission does not seem so\r\n' obvious if the process is visualised as the production of a certain complex wave form by the agent, which on interacting with the brain of the percipient produces impressions similar to those responsible for the original wave form. The process would then resemble television broadcasting or\r\nthe making and playing of a gramophone record more closely than communication of ideas with the speech code. What is needed for a direct\r\ntransmission would seem to be a mechanism rather than a code.\r\nThe question as to how a telepathic message reaches the right percipient does not arise as a difficulty for physical theories in the usual ex- perimental investigations on which the case for the occurrence of telepathy\r\nis most frequently based, since the percipient is in general consciously\r\nattempting to receive the message. In spontaneous cases the agent and\r\npercipient are usually very well known to each other and it does not seem\r\ninconceivable that some subtle specific associative relation based on\r\nelectromagnetic waves could develop in such cases. No detailed hypothesis can be advanced in the present state of knowledge, but one might\r\nnote in this connection the very close relation between the emission and\r\nabsorption of electromagnetic radiation exemplified in atomic and molecular spectra. The brain is, of course, enormously complicated compared\r\nwith such systems.\r\nA general association between telepathy and precognition is not by any means clearly apparent in considering the bulk of work on telepathy. In\r\nmost telepathic experiments precognition has not been observed. One\r\nmay note in this connection that W. W. Carington's (5) statistical evaluations of drawings do not always make a clear separation between retro- cognition and precognition considered as two distinct phenomena, and\r\ncertain criticisms of the procedures have been advanced by C. E. Stuart (6)\r\nand others (7). The experiments of S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney (2)\r\nprovide weighty evidence for a psi-faculty, but a number of hypotheses\r\nalternative to that of precognition might be advanced to explain their findings. In view of the large bulk of earlier work of various kinds in which\r\nprecognition was not noted, clearer experimental evidence would seem to be desirable before telepathy and precognition is recognised as being in\r\ngeneral fundamentally associated. Another approach to this question has\r\nbeen made by R. Wilson (8) who has pointed out that a physical mechanism of telepathy might lead to precognition as a result of quantum in- determinancy.\r\nThe effect of screening in telepathic experiments does not seem to have\r\nbeen investigated in a systematic way. In such experiments consideration\r\nwould have to be given to the possibility of leakage of energy through\r\nsmall apertures and to the propagation of electric waves in conducting\r\nmedia (9). A discussion of some relevant points has appeared recently (10).\r\nlo Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1947\r\nIt is very difficult to formulate any physical theory of telepathy except in a very general way. A number of problems of some difficulty present themselves, vi^hich may, however, be clarified to some extent by increased\r\nknowledge of the physics of biological systems. Little seems to be known\r\nabout the emission of electromagnetic radiation as a consequence of cerebral activity, although electrical phenomena in the brain are well known.\r\nIn connection with telepathic reception one might consider questions of\r\nvery specific interactions between radiation and matter, and the possibility\r\nof very small stimuli producing relatively large effects by some magnification process depending on a series of interdependent systems each involving many processes giving over all steady state conditions. The question of the association of sufficient complexity for telepathic images with\r\nsmall radiative stimuli or a small number of quanta may perhaps bear some resemblance to that of the production by the small number of atoms\r\nin the chromatin network of complex order by replication, as recently discussed by A. J. C. Wilson (11) in reviewing some considerations of E.\r\nSchroedinger from the viewpoint of psychical research.\r\nThe discussion given above is confined to interaction between two brains\r\nthrough the intermediary of electromagnetic radiation. It might, however,\r\nbe permissible to speculate on the possibility of some other mode of long\r\nrange physical interactions with very complex systems, a mode not at present known to science. If anything of this kind could be found a new\r\nphysical approach to telepathy would become possible.\r\nTo sum up, it seems that in attempting a rather general discussion of\r\ntelepathic phenomena it is possible to regard the usual arguments against\r\nphysical theories of telepathy as being rather less conclusive than they are usually considered to be, and the theory of electromagnetic radiation\r\nmight be given the status of a working hypothesis to be tested by further\r\nadvances in the study of brain physiology and of telepathic phenomena.\r\nREFERENCES\r\n(1) W.

Several instances of this have\r\nbeen reported, one of the best known being the case of the disturbances at Arensburg, in the Baltic, discussed [Journal, XIII) by Count Solovovo and\r\nothers. Another well-known case is that of the Chase Vault, Christ Church,\r\nBarbados, described by Commander R. T. Gould in his book Oddities.\r\nIn this latter case disturbances were discovered on several occasions when\r\nthe vault was opened between 18 12 and 1820.\r\nIt is curious that Barbados should recently ha\\e provided another\r\ninstance of this not very common phenomenon. It appears from an article by Sir A. Aspinall in The Journal of the Barbados Museiun and Historical\r\nSociety for May, 1945, that some leading Freemasons of Barbados, hearing\r\nthat the vault of Sir Evan AlacGregor, Governor of Barbados, which also\r\ncontained the remains of Alexander Irvine, the founder of Freemasonry- in the island, was to be opened for repairs, met by arrangement in the churchyard on the 24th August, 1943, just as the undertakers were beginning to unseal the vault. Sir A. Aspinall's account proceeds as follows :\r\n\"First of all the stone slabs over the steps leading down to the entrance were removed, and the arched doorway which had been hermetically\r\nsealed by a brick wall built after the burial of the Governor, was revealed.\r\nThen brick by brick the wall was taken down. After a few bricks had\r\nbeen removed the opening disclosed some metal object resting against\r\nthe inner side; then after more had been shifted it was seen that it was\r\nthe end of a large leaden coffin one end of which was propped up against\r\nthe wall, while the other rested on the floor. After the removal of the\r\nlast row of bricks the coffin came to rest on the floor of the vault, lying,\r\nnot parallel to the sides, but askew. It was the only coffin in the vault\r\nand the inscription upon it proved that it was that of Sir Evan MacGregor. It read : [sir evan john murr,\\y m.\\cgregor, bt., [governor\r\nOF BARBADOS, [DIED 14 JUNE 1841. Of Ir\\'ine's coffin there was not the\r\nslightest trace and the visitors came to the conclusion that it must have\r\nbeen made of wood and have fallen to pieces when the Governor was\r\ninterred. But at the far end of the vault, on a stone ledge running the\r\nentire length of the vault, were a skull and some bones\u2014apparentlv all that was left of Alexander Irvine.\r\nGovernor MacGregor's coffin was in perfect condition except for\r\nthree small holes where the lid had been soldered to the sides. It was\r\nnot opened, but a newspaper accoimt of the funeral stated that it enclosed a mahogany coffin covered with crimson velvet. The coffin was very long, as long indeed as the vauh.\r\nThe coffin was reverently replaced in its proper position along the\r\nleft side of the vault, leaving ample room for other coffins. How it came\r\n. ' to be tipped up remains a myster^^ It could not have been originally\r\nplaced in the peculiar position in which it was found, resting against\r\n12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1947\r\nthe inside of the brick wall. It was plain that it must have been shifted\r\nafter the vault had been closed ; but by whom or what? If sufficient\r\nbricks had been removed to permit anyone inside to get out of the vault\r\nthe coffin must have fallen, and it certainly could not have been raised\r\nup on end from the outside into the fantastic position in which it wasfound.\r\nAs was the case at Christ Church, there was not the slightest indication that floods or an earthquake were responsible for the derangement.\r\nHad poltergeists been at work again? Who can say? The whole affair remains a complete mystery.\"\r\nWe are indebted to Mr Charles Cave, one of the oldest members of the\r\nSociety, for calling our attention to this curious case.\r\nOBITUARY\r\nAs we go to press we regret to learn of the death of Sir Ernest Bermett,\r\nwho had been a member of the Society since 1894 and was at the time ofhis death the senior member of the Council to which he was co-opted in\r\n1 90 1. When a young man he became a close friend of the Hon. EverardFeilding, one of the very best investigators of physical phenomena, poltergeists and haunted houses that the Society has ever possessed, and hetook part with Feilding in several enquiries. In 1906 he was elected to Parliament and after that his main interest lay in politics in which he hada long and successful career. When in 1934 a series of talks on psychical\r\nresearch was given by the B.B.C. Sir Ernest Bennett gave the talk on\" Ghosts and Haunted Houses \"which was afterwards printed in the little book \" Inquiry into the Unknown.\" His talk aroused wide interest andresulted in many cases of haunted houses being communicated to him,and formed the basis of the book \" Apparitions and Haunted Houses \"which he published in 1939. The issue of xhe. Journal for December 1946contained a report by him of a poltergeist case which he had investigated\r\nduring the war.\r\nThe Accounts for the year ended 31 December 1946 were not to hand in\r\ntime to be printed in this issue of the Journal : they will be printed in thenext issue.\r\nJOURNAL OF THE\r\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\r\nMarch-April, 1947 Vol. XXXIV\u2014No. 633-634\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPAGE\r\nDiscussion Meetings - - - - - - - 13 New Members\r\nMeetings of the Council - - - - - - - 14\r\nAnnual General Meeting - - - - - - 16\r\nPrivate Meetings - - - - - - - - ly\r\nAnnual Accounts - - - - - - - _ ly\r\nCases : Precognitive Dream - - - - - - 21\r\nVeridical Information given by a medium of matters\r\noutside the sitter's knowledge - - - 22\r\nObituary : W.

Horsell, Assistant-Secretary.\r\nThe Hon. Secretary having read the notice convening the Meeting, read\r\nthe Annual Report which had not been distributed to members before the\r\nMeeting owing to current restrictions on the issue of periodicals. Copies\r\nof the Journal containing the Report and copies of the Annual Accounts were handed round to Members attending the Meeting.\r\nIn moving the adoption of the Report, the Hon. Secretary referred to the\r\nloss which the Society had recently sustained by the death of its senior\r\nmember of Council, Sir Ernest Bennett, and also to the grave illness of\r\nMr Whately Carington. He proposed to send Mrs Carington a letter expressing the good wishes of the Meeting.\r\nHe also read a letter from Mrs Blennerhassett in which she stated her\r\nintention of increasing the Blennerhassett Fund from \u00a31,000 to ^1,500 so\r\nthat the Fund might have an increase rather than suffer diminution owing\r\nto the reduction in the rate of interest. The adoption of the Report was\r\nseconded by Admiral Strutt, and carried unanimously.\r\nThe Hon. Treasurer presented the Accounts, and pointed out that the\r\nSociety was just paying its way, the balance in hand at the end of the year\r\nbeing due to donations which had been received. He moved the adoption\r\nof the Accounts, which was carried unanimously.\r\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for election to membership of the Council other than the six members who retired by\r\nrotation. On the proposal of Mr Salter, seconded by the Rev. C. Drayton\r\nThomas, the following six members were accordingly unanimously\r\nelected : Professor C. D. Broad, Mr Whately Carington, Professor E. R.\r\nDodds, Miss I. Jephson, the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., and\r\nProfessor H. H. Price.\r\nOn the proposal of Admiral Strutt, seconded by Mr. Salter, Messrs. Miall,\r\nSavage, Avery & Co. were re-elected Auditors for the forthcoming year.\r\nMAR.-APR. 1947 Annual Accounts 17\r\nPRIVATE MEETINGS\r\nThe 193rd Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library on\r\nThursday, 6 February 1947, at 6.45 p.m., when Mr W.

Bell, a mem.ber of the Society. The dreamer, Mrs Clark,\r\nand her daughter, Mrs Brown, are near neighbours of Mrs Bell's, whom\r\nshe knows well and describes as reliable and accurate people. Mrs Brown\r\ntold Mrs Bell about the dream, which had occurred on the night of 23-24\r\nDecember 1946, on 27 December, and at Mrs Bell's request she wrote the\r\nfollowing statement and had it confirmed by her mother the same day.\r\n\" On the morning of Christmas Eve, my mother told me of a strange\r\ndream she had had the previous night. She found two German prisoners\r\nin our hall, who said they had been invited out to tea at a certain house in\r\nthe village and when they arrived they were told the lady had gone away.\r\nThey were directed to another house but did not wish to go and wanted to come to us. My mother said that one stooped and also spoke better\r\nEnglish.\r\n\" On Christmas Day, just before tea, I went out for a short walk and\r\nnoticed two German prisoners on the doorstep of a house and wondered if they had been invited there. As I went on I argued with my conscience,\r\nbecause I knew that if they were still there when I returned, I ought to ask\r\nthem to tea, because it was raining and miserable, and I did not want to. To my relief they had gone when I came back, but glancing across the road\r\nI saw them standing there. I immediately went over and invited them in. \" As they entered the hall I remembered the dream and after showing\r\nthem into the dining-room I fetched my mother and jokingly said, ' Your\r\nGermans have arrived.' To my surprise, when she saw them she said,\r\n' They are the identical pair that I saw in my dream.\r\n'\r\n\" signed M. Imrie Brown.\"\r\nMrs Clark added, \" This account is absolutely correct, and several times\r\nduring tea I was quite aware what would happen next. \" signed L. Move Clark.\"\r\nIn answer to further enquiries Mrs Clark sent the following details of her\r\nexperiences during the visit of the Germans.\r\n31;\/- 47\r\n\"... One of the prisoners was taller and stooped a little just as I had\r\nseen him in my dream. The other, short and dark, scarcely spoke\r\nEnglish at all, as his friend explained in my dream and also as soon as they came into our house. Therefore conversation was difficult during tea. As my son-in-law had been stationed in Germany during the war, I suggested he should get some snaps he had taken when there and show the\r\nboys. While he went to another room to get them something seemed to say to me, ' One of these boys, the dark one, comes from there.' Such\r\nproved to be the case. He got very excited when he saw the snaps, and his\r\nfriend interpreted what he was saying. ' It is his home.' Then again, I knew that he would show us his family photos and immediately he drew a small case from his pocket which I had seen before and showed me his wife\r\nand daughter who looked quite familiar to me.\r\n22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1947\r\n\" The ' elated ' feeling certainly was mine though I called it ' excitement ', which lasted long into the night, keeping me from sleep, but\r\nmaking me feel so happy that I found rAyself smiling.\"\r\nA letter from Mrs Bell, enclosing the above account, states that these\r\ndetails were exactly as told her verbally on 27 December. She adds that\r\nMrs Clark has had a number of other similar and more interesting dreams,\r\nbut that she sends this one as she heard it immediately after its occurrence.\r\nIt will be noticed that the dream is not an exact reproduction of what\r\noccurred. This appears to be another case of the fact pointed out by\r\nProfessor H. H. Price in his recent broadcast that extra-sensory perceptions\r\nare \" representative \" rather than photographic reproductions of what\r\nactually occurs. He suggested the possibility that the information is correctly received by the subconscious but gets distorted in the effort to pass it through to consciousness. Success in doing this may cause the \" elation \" mentioned by the percipient. It is of interest that other percipients, particularly Miss Nancy Johnson, have reported similar feelings\r\nof elation during moments of extra-sensory perception.\r\nVERIDICAL INFORMATION GIVEN BY A MEDIUM OF\r\nMATTERS OUTSIDE THE SITTER'S KNOWLEDGE\r\nThe following interesting incident from a sitting with a trance medium is reported by the Hon. Mrs H. Gay, who writes as follows : \" I made an appointment in July 1946 with Mrs Bedford for September\r\n1 8th with the purpose, if possible, of obtaining evidential messages from\r\na friend of mine who had been killed in a motor accident the previous May.\r\n\" Early in August I went to stay with Mr and Mrs B for a couple of\r\nnights who had an old and intimate friend dying in their house. I saw him\r\nfor a few moments and he told me what a comfort it was to him to be there\r\nwith them, but he was too ill to talk much and a few days later he died. \" I was not there when he died and did not hear any details of his death\r\n(beyond the fact that it had been peaceful), nor did I see the B 's until\r\nafter my sitting with Mrs Bedford on September i8th. At this sitting I received no messages at all from the friend who had been killed in the motor\r\naccident, but received the messages given in the enclosed notes, which I took down verbatim in an abbreviated long-hand.\"\r\nIn the account which follows, the sentences printed in italics contain\r\ninformation unknown to Mrs Gay which subsequently proved correct. The comments in inverted commas are those of Mrs B., to whom the\r\nrecord of the sitting was shown.\r\nK. Gay. Sitting with Mrs Bedford\r\nSept. i8th, 1946 Commenis.\r\nYour mother is here.

It seems clear that the income will, in fact, be\r\nincreased. Our readers will appreciate this generous gift to the Fund.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nSir,\u2014On January 7th I saw my son study a plan of London before going\r\nout. On his return he remarked that it might interest me to know that he\r\nhad looked up West Eaton Place for he knew somebody was going to ask\r\nhim where it was while he was out, and he wanted to have the answer\r\nready. This happened as he had foreseen.\r\nProfessor Broad wrote in Philosophy for November, 1944, that the quantitative experiments performed by Dr Soal during the four previous years\r\nprovided \" evidence which is statistically overwhelming for the occurrence,\r\nnot only of telepathy but of precognition \". Dr Soal's evidence does not\r\nstand alone ; nor is Professor Broad the only eminent man to be over- whelmed by it. Professor Broad also said in his Presidential address to the S.P.R. in 1935 :\r\n. \" The degree of belief which it is reasonable to attach to an alleged fact or a proposed theory depends jointly on two factors, viz. : [a) its ante- cedent probability or improbability, and {b) the trustworthiness of the\r\nevidence and the extent to which it seems to exclude all alternatives except\r\nthe one suggested. On precisely similar evidence it would be reasonable to believe much more strongly that an accused man had cheated at cards if one knew him to be a bookmaker than it would be if one knew him to be an Anglican bishop, because the antecedent probability of the alleged event is much greater in the former case than in the latter. Now antecedent\r\nprobability depends very largely on analogy or coherence of the suggested\r\nproposition with what is already known or reasonably believed about the\r\nsubject matter with which it is concerned. Antecedent improbability\r\ndepends very largely on lack of analogy or positive discordance with what\r\nis already known or reasonably believed.\"\r\n26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1947\r\nBefore quantitative experiments proved the existence of E.S.P. to those\r\nwho are wilHng dispassionately to study the evidence, it needed a good\r\ndeal more evidence than would hang a man for the S.P.R. even to label\r\na case well-documented. This was essential when its aim was to prove\r\nthe existence of an antecedently improbable faculty. But the question\r\nDoes it exist.' \" has been answered, except for those who for psychological reasons would not be convinced were the heavens themselves to open. Are not the vital questions today: How, Why, and On what occasions,\r\ndoes it emerge?\r\nI have reason to believe that members are diffident about sending in cases because they understand that the corroboration required must be\r\nwatertight in every case. Consequently a number of cases, which internal\r\nevidence would show to be similar in nature to well-documented cases, are not reported, and valuable cumulative hints as to the nature of E.S.P. may\r\nthus be lost. For in future it is largely from the experiences of the percipients themselves that we shall have to widen our knowledge. Further,\r\na wrong impression of the incidence of the faculty may thereby be created ; private enquiry suggests that this is more widespread than the cases received by the Society indicate.\r\nIn the changed circumstances, would not a statement of policy about\r\nevidence, to include guidance on such points as the following, be of help\r\nto members.?\r\n1. Before the experimental confirmation of precognition, the case quoted above would not have been considered evidential, because my son\r\ndid not tell me of his impression before it was confirmed. Even had he\r\ndone so it would probably still have been classed as a chance coincidence, or we should have been suspected of delusions or collusion. Now that\r\nprecognition is no longer antecedently improbable, is such a case of greater\r\ninterest to the Society.?\r\n2. During his childhood my son produced corroborated evidence of\r\nE.S.P. Does this add to the value of the above case?\r\n3. Before the experimental evidence, had the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nhimself sent us an uncorroborated statement that he had seen the ghost of a\r\nliving friend, we should have been bound to believe any other explanation\r\nof his statement rather than that he had seen what he thought he saw. But now that such ghosts have become respectable \" telepathic hallucinations corresponding to the situation of some other person at the time\",\r\nmay we legitin?ately take a serious interest in the unsupported word of an Archbishop? Does the fact that my son is an accurately minded\r\nmathematical scholar at Cambridge add to the probability that when he\r\nsaid he had known that someone would ask him a certain question, he was\r\nspeaking the truth?\r\n4. It is now widely accepted that telepathic impressions are representative, rather than photographic reproductions, and that they may be of any\r\ndegree of accuracy, or even symbolic. Does not this imply that cases of\r\napparent E.S.P. are of interest even if they do not exactly correspond to the\r\nevent portrayed? Distortions themselves, if studied in sufficient numbers,\r\nshould be instructive.\r\n5. Could members be informed that a wider range of cases would now\r\nbe of interest, but that they would be classified in two categories :\r\nMAR.-APR. 1947 . .\r\n' Review 27\r\nA. With standards of evidence as heretofore. B. First-hand reports of cases of apparent E.S.P. by percipients known\r\nto members of the Society, which may be less well corroborated.\r\nI am aware that this suggestion may bring down upon my head the\r\naccusation of a wish to lower the standards of evidence of the Society. Far\r\nfrom this being the case, I merely want to enquire whether, in view of the\r\nconfirmation of the existence of E.S.P., it may not be as unscientific to ignore less well-documented cases as it would be to accept them uncritically. Also I feel that members need encouragement to send in cases and\r\nguidance as to how to do so. Yours, etc., Rosalind Heywood\r\nSir,\u2014In the early numbers of our Proceedings numerous authenticated\r\naccounts of Apparitions and Ghosts were published. At that time and ever\r\nsince, other accounts often equally well authenticated have appeared in the\r\nJournal. To give two examples there is the case of Samuel Bull, sweep\r\n(Oct. 1932) and that of the Misses Scott (Vol. VI, p. 146 and Vol. IX,\r\np. 298). The former is I think the most striking of all and was investigated on the spot by Lord Balfour and others. The latter is a striking account of an open air haunting. There are a number of others. Owing to their\r\npublication in the Journal none of these are available to the general public.\r\nI suggest that a selection of the best cases should be made and published in a special volume of the Proceedings with any changes of name that may be\r\nnecessary to cover promises of anonymity. This would be of great assist- ance to students of the subject.\r\nYours faithfully, ^ ^^^^^^^ We are grateful to Mr Abdy Collins for his suggestion. There are, as he\r\npoints out, many adequately authenticated cases in the Journal which\r\nmight well be published for the benefit of students of psychical research,\r\neither in a special volume of Proceedings or, perhaps even more usefully, in\r\na separate publication.\r\n\r\nEd.\r\nREVIEW\r\nSome Human Oddities. By E. J. Dingwall. Pp. 198, 12 plates. London;\r\nHome and Van Thai, 1947. 15s. There is much more in Dr Dingwall's latest work than a lurid recital of the doings of six queer people ; he has in fact given us a serious study\r\nin the fantastic. Each chapter presents an unsolved problem. One chapter\r\nis devoted to D. D. Home and another to the levitating saint, Joseph of\r\nCopertino.\r\nThe D. D.. Home mystery is the one which most concerns psychical\r\nresearchers. Dr Dingwall's approach is unusual. He does not attempt the\r\ncustomary detailed analysis and appraisal of seance reports. Instead, he\r\nhas made full use of his erudition in these matters to present the reader\r\nwith a choice and illuminating selection of contemporary observations. One\r\ngets a clear picture of the attitudes of the people with whom Home came in\r\ncontact, and of the conditions in which his seances were conducted.\r\n28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1947\r\nThis chapter contains three fresh contributions to the accepted story of\r\nD. D. Home. The author has unearthed a new report of the famous Ashley\r\nPlace levitation, when Home floated out of one window and in at the next. The account is supposed to have been written by Lord Dunraven himself,\r\nalthough it contradicts the classical version and does not fit in with the\r\nactual configuration of the premises at Ashley Place. The theory is put forward that Home had homosexual tendencies. This would explain the\r\nscandalous rumours which dogged him through life, the mysterious expulsion from France after sittings at the Tuileries and the antipathy felt towards him by Browning and others. The circumstances of the LyonHome case are reviewed, and it is shown that Home was by no means as guilty in that affair as is generally supposed. Mrs Lyon hoped to use the\r\nfamous medium to gain entry to spheres of society where previously she hadbeen snubbed. When she saw that her ambitions were not going to berealised, she thought better of it and reclaimed the money she had settled on Home.\r\nOther sections of the book deserve more than the brief reference whichis all that can be given here. As far as witnesses and signed depositions are concerned, the levitations of St Joseph appear to be the best attested ever, not excluding those of D. D. Home. They occurred often, both in buildings and outside, and in the presence of all sorts of bystanders. The levita- tions took place in broad daylight and were closely observed and commentedupon in great detail. We can only lament with the author that nowadays,\r\nwhen we have the camera to record their feats, \" saints do not seem to fly as they used to do.\"\r\nThe chapter on Deacon Paris is mainly of medico-psychological interest.\r\nIt describes some extraordinary instances of submission to torture bywomen under the influence of religious fanaticism. On reading the chapter on Angel Anna\u2014a disgusting wonder-worker who seems to have stepped\r\nout of the pages of the Neivs of the World\u2014one senses the writer's ownbrutal experience of the seamy side of psychic phenomena. The odioustrade of the psychic charlatan, its revolting associations, the infamy of its accomplices, and the degrading credulity of its supporters, are all broughtout in this unpleasant story.\r\nAltogether, Dr Dingwall is. to be congratulated on producing a bookwhich is as fascinating as its contents are fantastic.

N. M. Tyrrell read\r\na paper on \" The Spontaneous Phenomena of Psychical Research \". On Thursday, i May 1947, at 6.45 p.m., the Research Officer, Dr D J West, opened a discussion on \" The Work of the Society's Research\r\nDepartment \".\r\n32 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli may 1947\r\nSOME RECENT COMMUNICATIONS\r\nRECEIVED THROUGH MISS CUMMINS\r\n[Miss Gibbcs (E.B.G.) has sent us the following account of veridical communications received during 1945 through Miss Geraldine Cummins, whose\r\nmediumship is well known to our members.]\r\nFictitious names of persons and places are used throughout, but the real names have been disclosed to the Hon. Editor.\r\nMiss Cummins spent the greater part of the war years from 1939-1944\r\nin Ireland looking after an invalid mother and doing other rather nerve- wracking work. After the death of her mother in October 1944 she returned\r\nto London in February 1945. She did not seem very well but we had a few\r\npersonal sittings for automatic writing before she returned to Ireland for\r\nthe summer in June of that year.\r\nDuring one of these sittings (March 19th, 1945) the following announce- ment was made by her control, Astor : \" I must tell you there is a stranger here, a quiet grey-haired womanwith a curious force. So I have been compelled to pass on what is her\r\nmessage. She says she died in Kensington. She shows me a foot, that is her surname, I gather. Then a daisy, Yes, Marguerite Foote. She says\r\nshe worked for a long time with an important public man\u2014knew him well.\r\nShe gives the name James. She says she wants to talk to Donald about\r\nJames and that Donald hopes to come to this town in April. If so, she begs\r\nthat you see him for the writing, not to let anything interfere as she has\r\nsomething important to say about James.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" I don't quite follow all this, Astor.\"\r\n\" You may know in April, as Donald is likely to want to see you if he has\r\ntime.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" I grasp whom you mean now.\"\r\n\" That is all about her now. She doesn't seem able to give surnames. She seems to have been over here about three years. She says her message\r\nis important in regard to future events.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" Tell her I will remember and arrange.\"\r\nThe above came as a surprise. I soon realised however to whom tl 3 reference was meant. Later I looked up the name Foote in the telephone\r\ndirectory but could find no one in Kensington likely to fit the name given\r\nin the script.\r\nAfter the sitting Miss Cummins said she recollected something about\r\nDonald X but couldn't remember what, and asked if any allusion had been\r\nmade to him. I answered in the affirmative and enquired if he might be\r\ncoming to London. She replied that she thought it extremely unlikely. I made no reference to the stranger.\r\nDuring Miss Cummins's absence in Ireland, she had given an occasional\r\nsitting to a friend, Donald X. He had been much impressed by, and was\r\nvery interested in, her psychic abilities. Through her he had received\r\ncommunications purporting to come from the mother of a well-known\r\nbusiness man. Thinking there might be some interesting developments, I followed up this trail at the next sitting.\r\nMAY 1947 Communications received through Miss Cummins 33\r\nMarch 25TH 1945, at 25 Jubilee Place, S.W. 3 \" Astor is here ; Am I to call Hilda [my sister-in-law]? She and her\r\nfamily have been together to-day.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" Yes, but I should first like to ask you a few questions.\"\r\n\" I shall try to reply to them.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" You remember the quiet, grey-haired woman stranger, you\r\ndescribed the other day.? \"\r\n\" Yes, she was an interesting woman with a keen brain, extremely quick\r\nbut quiet, like one w^ho had very great self-control and grip of herself.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" Had she spoken before? \"\r\n\" No, she never communicated through my child [i.e. the medium]. In\r\nfact, it was her first visit. She knows Donald X. At least, she had seen him when she was staying with her employer whom she called James. When I asked her who James was, she replied that he was a man of affairs and did not seem to wish to give more information. I said was he in busi- ness and she replied that ' he was a very important business man ' and\r\nsmiled.\"\r\n\" I said what kind of goods did he deal in? \" She said, \" Every kind.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" I wanted to trace her.\"\r\n\" She seems to have had a confidential post with James.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" She said she died in Kensington. Is there nothing more you\r\ncan tell me in this respect? \"\r\n\" She said she died in Kensington and that Donald would know her\r\nand that she did not particularly wish that you should find out who\r\nshe was.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" Well, we will leave it at that.\" \" That was her habit in life\u2014to keep secrets, and so she was always\r\nreserved with strangers.\"\r\nE.B.G. \" I tried to trace her name in a book here, but of course could\r\nnot do so, It was too vague, as she might have died in any house in Kensington.\" ^\r\n\" She did not say she died here. I asked her. She said, ' There is more\r\nthan one Kensington in the world ' and smiled.\"\r\nAt a subsequent sitting the following spontaneous reference to Marguerite\r\nFoote was made.\r\n25, Jubilee Place, Chelsea, S.W. 3 Saturday Afternoon, April 14TH, 1945\r\n_ \" Astor is here. There is near to you the quiet grey-haired lady, but if she\r\nis quiet she is persistent. She has for over a week been pressing me to speak to you about her first message. Her name is Marguerite Foote At\r\nlast I have that clearly from her. She says I gave her message wrongly to you. She had said James is coming over here in April and that she wanted\r\nto speak about James to Donald. She wanted to warn him that James was coming over. I see now that this lady does not belong to this country but\r\nshe is not French. She died in Kensington, New Zealand. She says she\r\nhad retired there because she could not carry on her work any longer\r\n34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY 1947\r\nShe says she knows Sheila took her place lately with James ; but it wasn't\r\nthe same thing. Sheila is very clever but hasn't the experience of course. Do you want me to send this lady away? \" EBG. \" I remembered, and would have asked Mr X to come here in\r\nApril if he had visited this country. But now, as you say the message has\r\nbeen misinterpreted, we can convey it to him. We have not heard that he\r\nis coming here.\"\r\n\" She says she was working for a long time in a confidential position\r\nfor James and that it has given her the greatest joy to see him resting\r\nafter the passage of death. He is with his mother, or rather, she came\r\nto him.\"\r\nEBG. \" Tell her that I will send the message as she wishes.\"\r\n\" Yes, I have told her. She is satisfied.\"\r\nAfter the death of James, Miss Cummins wrote a letter of sympathy to . Mr X. She added something to the effect that, \" A Miss Marguerite Foote\r\nhad called here in March and that she was worried about something\r\nhappening to a friend of his in April. She said she was from Kensington,\r\nN.Z.\" Miss Cummins added that she hesitated to write to Mr X as she\r\nknew nothing whatever about this lady. But she was a nice grey-haired\r\nwoman. Also that she had called again yesterday.\r\nA letter from Mr X was received by Miss Cummins on May ist, 1945. -\r\nIt runs as follows :\r\n(Extract) April 24, 1945.\r\nDublin.\r\n\" Dear Miss Cummins,\r\nThank you so much for your kind letter of sympathy. Millie and I are both grateful for it. What you wrote about Marguerite Foote is most\r\ninteresting and evidential. You may have since learned that she was\r\nJames's confidential secretary for many years and died about two years ago.\r\nWhat is most evidential is that she told you she lived in 'Kensington, N.Z.',\r\nwhich is not generally known ; also the fact that she had white hair, though\r\nrelatively a young woman. How did that come through.? If I could have\r\nexcerpts from the script covering these two episodes, I should be most\r\ngrateful. Obviously, Miss Foote was hoping to get word to James through\r\nyou and me to take care of his health. ... If you come over let us know.\r\nWe not only want to see you but feel that some interesting things might\r\ncome through. Please remember me to Miss Gibbes.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nDonald X.\"\r\nCopy of letter sent by Miss Gibbes to Mr X : May 1st, 1945. \" Dear Mr X,\r\nMiss Cummins has read me extracts from your letter to her concerning\r\nMarguerite Foote. As I am anxious to collect any evidence of survival,\r\nwould you be so good as to let me know a few more details concerning her.?\r\nI take a few questions from the three scripts copies of which I enclose.\r\nYour answers would of course be regarded by us as confidential.\r\nMAY 1947 Communications received through Miss Cummins 35\r\nWas Marguerite \" quiet, grey-haired and with a curious force \"?\r\nDid she \" work for a long time with James and know him well \"?\r\nIn your letter you say she died about two years ago. Astor says about\r\nthree years. But time is often a stumbling block in communications as you\r\nprobably know, so this is near enough.\r\nWould you describe M. Foote as \" an interesting woman with a keen\r\nbram, extremely quick, quiet and self-controlled \" etc. as described.?\r\nShe claims she knows you, or at least had seen you when she was staying with her employer. Is this a fact.? \" A confidential post \" with James. Your letter confirms this. Was she \" reserved with strangers \" and \" persistent\r\nYou affirm that she died in Kensington, N.Z. (A place, the existence of\r\nwhich was utterly unknown to Miss Cummins and myself).\r\nWas she \" unable to carry on her work any longer and so retired \".? Is it a fact that a woman named Sheila took her place with James and\r\nwas It just lately? Is Sheila not quite so efficient as M. F. as indicated?\r\nIs Sheila \" clever but not so experienced \".? The script indicates that she was working for a long time as Secretary.\r\nI note your letter states she was confidential secretary for many years.\r\nIn view of the fact that it v\/as after the announcement of \" James's \" death that Astor wrote he had misinterpreted the original message concerning him, It is interesting to note a few points which would seem to indicate\r\nthat this statement is correct.\r\n1. \" She wants to talk to Donald about James. ... In April.\"\r\n(Communication of March 19)\r\n2. \" not to let anything interfere as she had something important to say about James ... you may know in April.\"\r\n(March 19)\r\n3. Her message \" important in regard to future events \".(March 19)\r\nWith reference to the suggestion in your letter that Miss Cummins may\r\nhave learnt that M. F. was his confidential secretary and died two years ago\r\n1 can assure you that neither Miss Cummins nor I have seen anything of\r\nthe kind. Had we done so, we should have thought immediately of this communicator. In any case it is indicated in script of March 25th that M. b . held ' A confidential post \" with James. Also in script of March 19\r\nthat she worked for a long time with an important public man \". Yours sincerely,\r\nE. B. GiBBES.\"\r\nCopy of letter received from Mr X :\r\n(Personally typed) \"Dear Miss Gibbes : ^\r\n1 As I have written to Miss Cummins I shall be very happy to work\r\nwith you on this matter and give such assistance as I can for I think you\r\nMay loth, 1945.\r\n36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1947\r\nhave an evidential case of the first order. Answering your questions in the\r\norder in which you ask them I should say that : 1. Marguerite Foote could be described quite accurately as a woman\r\nwith a \" curious force \". She was gray haired even while a young woman\r\nand white haired toward the end.\r\n2. She did work for a long time with \" James \" and knew him extremely\r\nwell.\r\n3. I will verify the time of her death. It may have been more than two\r\nyears.\r\n4. She was the kind of woman that could make herself interesting to anyone who interested her and whom she considered worth while. She\r\nnever could have attained the position she held without exceptional\r\nqualities.\r\n5. She knows me well. She was in my friend's household from, I think\r\nit was 1922.\r\n6. Yes, most confidential. I doubt if anything went over his desk that\r\nshe did not know about.\r\n7. She never talked about my friend's aifairs or discussed any public\r\nbusiness to my knowledge.\r\n8. She died in a Wellington suburb. I believe it was Kensington. I will verify this as it is important.\r\n9. Yes, she was unable to carry on for several years before she died.\r\nID. Yes, it is a fact that a woman named Sheila took over and she was\r\nnot so experienced but is clever.\r\nI suggest that you try to obtain from Astor answers to the following\r\nquestions which I shall be able to verify : What illness overtook M. F. ? What was the name that she was known by in her employer's family?\r\nThis would be very evidential.\r\nWhat other nam.e has Sheila? Describe colour of hair, married or single\r\n(I can verify such answers out of my own knowledge). Does Astor know\r\nof any kinsfolk of Sheila who have sent messages through him and Geraldine C. to me for others.\r\nIf M. F. comes again tell her I am very anxious to receive any message\r\nfrom \" James \" who believes in communication.\r\nThe dates and the misinterpretation of Astor's messages are most\r\nsignificant. . . .\r\nI shall be glad to show you the scripts that G. C. obtained with me. They contain some extraordinary things.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nDonald X.\"\r\nNotes of sitting held on the morning of Mav i6th, 1945 at 25 Jubilee\r\nPlace, S.W. 3.\r\n\" Astor comes.\"\r\n' EBG. \" The last time we wrote you said that the lady with grey hair, the\r\nstranger, was around but we had no time then to talk with her. Would she\r\nlike to come now? \"\r\nMAY 1947 Communications received through Miss Cummins 37\r\n\" Yes. I can call her Here she is. She is very interested in you and it is because she knows Donald X. She says that James is with his own people\r\nand that he was delighted too, to catch up on Walter R. whom, he said, had\r\nbeaten him on the post in the journey to this world.\"\r\nEBG. \" Who is Walter R. ? the rest of his name.? \"\r\n\" He said Walter and he were two sick men together and they had a private\r\nbet as to which of them would live the longest. James lost the bet. James\r\nthought he would go first. That is what this lady tells me. Walter R.,\r\nthat was the name.\"\r\nEBG. \" Has she any message she would like to send to Mr X? \"\r\n\" She is delighted to hear you will give a message to Donald. Tell him\r\nshe says, that James is not only happy but so darned glad to be able to think about himself. For the first time for many years he has been able to have a good think about himself.\"\r\nEBG. \" Does she remember if she was called by any special name in James's family.? \"\r\n\" She says she was known by more than one name.\"\r\n(Here followed an attempt to write what looks like O or Q and Chap or Cheep.)\r\n\" I am trying to get her to write it.\" (Another attempt.)\r\nEBG. \" When she first came you gave her name correctly.\" \" She showed me a large daisy and a foot, that's how I got it originally.\r\nShe may give it to Donald later.\" EBG. \" But he knows the nickname so it wouldn't be the same.\"\r\n\" She does not say anything more about that.\"\r\nEBG. \"I wonder if she can remember what other name Sheila had?\r\nand the colour of her hair and if married or single.? \"\r\n\" Wait. I will ask her. She says Sheila's name is Ship\u2014no, it begins like Ship but it isn't a ship.\r\nShipton. That is the name she makes in signs to me.\r\nShipton. It may not be quite correct because the signs are difficult. But\r\nthe special name they called her seemed to begin with the sign C.\"\r\nEBG. \" And was Sheila married.?\"\r\n\" She says Sheila was married, that she is a live wire and has a quick brain\r\nand is very attractive. Her husband, I think, is in the Army. Marguerite\r\npoints to a uniform when she speaks of the husband who has some appointment.\"\r\nEBG. \" Astor, do you know any kinsfolk of Sheila's who have sent\r\nmessages through you and the medium here, to Donald X..? \" (Some names were here given which were later verified by Mr Donald X\r\nas relevant.)\r\n(EBG. \" I wonder if she recollects what illness overtook her?\"\r\n\" She does not know to which illness vou refer. She was very ill at one\r\ntime from anaemia, debility, but I can't hold her longer. ...\"\r\nEBG. \" Tell her I will ask for her again some time Astor. Your child is tired. . . . Goodbye.\"\r\n{Note made after the sitting.)\r\nMiss Cummins is not as strong as she used to be before the war and so the power does not, at present, last so long as formerly.\r\n38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1947\r\nAfter the sitting I asked Miss Cummins if she knew who had been\r\nwriting? She rephed, giving the name of my relative, and then said she\r\n\" saw a woman with grey, silvery hair\u2014pale, at least her face seemed pale\r\nand she looked puzzled or rather, she got the impression that she was\r\npuzzled, as though she didn't quite know what to make of me,\"\u2014\" a Httle suspicious, that's all I got.\" Later she added \" Didn't we have Marguerite back? (yes) that must have been she then.\"\r\nCopy of Letter from Donald X, dated May 25 and received by Miss Gibbes\r\nJune ist 1945 :\r\n\"Dear Miss Gibbes,\r\nI was very much interested in your letter dated May i6th with\r\nenclosures. It only arrived two days ago. The last script is most extra- ordinary and convincing. I can tell you now that everything about Sheila\r\nis correct. (Mr X then verified the names above mentioned.) The success\r\nin getting the name Shipton through makes me suspect the possibility that\r\nM. F. didn't want to have her \" pet name \" come out. Possibly she tried\r\nto write \" cheap \" in protest though I see no reason for it. Perhaps later she will give it so that I won't tell you now. The bit about Walter R. staggered me. See if you can get the nick name\r\nby v\/hich he was generally known to his intimates. The reference is most\r\nevidential. I won't give you the details yet but this was significant.\r\nGive our best to G. [Miss Cummins]. I can quite understand that she\r\nis worn out. Her devotion to her mother during her long and trying illness was extraordinary and the shock of the ending.\r\nIf you get Marguerite again thank her for me and tell her I appreciate\r\nvery much her news of James and that when there is a favourable opportunity I shall pass it on to those to whom it means a great deal. This has developed into a most interesting and evidential research.\r\nPlease keep me in touch with it and I will pass on any useful suggestions\r\nthat occur to me. Yours sincerely,\r\nDonald X.\"\r\nCopy of letter sent to Mr X by E. B. G. :\r\n\"\r\n25, Jubilee Place,\r\nChelsea, S.W. 3. May 215\/, 1945.\r\nDear Mr X,\r\nWe had a short sitting today for a relative. Astor at once wrote as follows : Astor is here. I have a word to say about a previous writing. There was\r\nlittle power near the end of it so I was not able to obtain all the answers\r\nclearly. You asked me to find out the Christian name the family knew and\r\nused for Miss Foote. I think that was the request. I got the name Alice\r\nfrom her in signs. So I presume that was the name required, Alice Foote.\r\nShe made the signs that shaped this name I have written.\r\nMAY 1947 Communications received through Miss Cummins 39\r\n(EBG. Thank you. I think the request was for the name by which she was known in James's family).\r\nThe name of my relative was then announced. And the writing proceeded on other lines.\r\nI hope the above has some meaning to you. Recently we had another\r\ncommunication of a very evidential nature concerning a woman of the\r\nname, Alice. ^ I hope there is no confusion.\r\nAs it happens, I have not shown G. the last script. I told her bits of it but I carefully concealed the fact that there was any suggestion of a request\r\nfor a name. Nor did I tell her that I had sent you the page on which the names were written. She is quite unaware that she had written any.\r\nWith kind regards.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nE.B.G.\"\r\nCopy of letter from Mr X received by EBG. Dated May 30th 1945 :\r\n\" Dear Miss Gibbes,\r\nThanks for your letter of May 21st. I do not know whether \" Alice \" was one of the names of Marguerite Foote or not. Probably it-was not but\r\nI will enquire. Alice is not the name I was hoping to get. How would it be, when opportunity presents itself, to ask whether Marguerite Foote\r\nwished not to tell the name James called her by and which James's family\r\nused in speaking to and of her.\r\nG.C. and Astor are so marvellous in giving names that I suspect that\r\nthere is a holding back on M.F.'s part. . . . I am waiting with interest to see what you get on the subject of Walter R.\r\nThis is one of the most extraordinary bits of evidence that I have ever come across.

June 6ih 1945\r\nDear Mr X,\r\nMany thanks for yours of May 25th and 30th returning page of names belonging to the script. You say the name Shipton is correct. But to whom does it belong.'\r\nI am very interested in what you say about Walter R. In view of the\r\nfact that G. returns to Ireland in a few days, I decided that I would try to get in touch with M. Foote again so as to obtain if possible answers to your\r\nquestions and thus eliminate the influence of the sitter's mind. For you\r\nwill be seeing G. in Dublin shortly. Herewith is the result. From it, do I gather that Walter R.'s name is Robson or is that the nick-name? And\r\nthat he was also at one time a secretary or confidential friend ? You will see\r\nthat M. Foote says Alice was her first name. Can you verify this\u2014Also if she died in Kensington, N.Z.,\u2014if there is such a place?\r\nI shall be glad to hear if the name Pussy conveys anything to your wife?\r\nGeraldine told me her name was Millie in course of conversation a short\r\ntime ago. Would you also let me know if the reference to fire is correct?\r\nAlso, if she has been over a number of years? And also if she talked very\r\nquickly when on earth? This is a small point but may have been a\r\ncharacteristic of the alleged communicator.\r\nIn yours of May 25th you say \" Everything about Sheila is correct.\"\r\nAm I to take it she is a \" live wire \" and has a quick brain and that her\r\nhusband is in the Army and has some appointment?\r\nI asked G. later on, as she said she thought M. F. had been speaking, if she had ever had a Walter R. writing through her to you? She replied in\r\nthe negative so far as she could recollect. She was very anxious to hear if anything of interest had been communicated at enclosed sitting. But\r\nbeyond saying that it was very interesting I thought, I told her nothing as\r\nI didn't want to spoil anything else that might come through her to you by\r\nher previous knowledge of what had been said, etc.\r\nI shall be very intrigued to hear what you think of the enclosed. But it\r\nis unlikely that we have any more sittings before she goes, as she seems\r\nvery tired and her \" power \" does not, alas, last as long as it used. I have\r\nassured her that you are delighted with the results of this experiment and\r\nthat encouraged her. Please forgive typing errors, etc. With kind regards.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nE.B.G.\"\r\n42 Joimial of Society for Psychical Research MAY 1947\r\nCopy of letter from Mr X dated Sunday, June 17th 1945 :\r\n\" Dear Miss Gibbes,\r\nI have been long delayed in answering your last very interesting letter with script enclosed. This is, your letter of June 6th.\r\nShipton is Sheila's married name. She is James's daughter.\r\nWaker R. is Walter Robson. For many years he was James's close\r\nfriend. He died on board ship when on a voyage with James. James\r\nalways called him by a nickname as did all his circle. This I will not tell you yet. The trio might well mean Robson, James and Miss Foote.\r\nThey worked very closely for years. To me this is very evidential. I shall find out whether Marguerite Foote 's first name was Ahce. I did not know\r\nit. \" Pussy \" is my wife's sister, that is correct. My wife is Millie. She,\r\nPussy, was burned to death in her house. There are some details that\r\nmight come through which would be evidential so I shall not say more at present except that she was a very vivacious personality. . . . We expect to see G.C. on the 20th and if she is up to it, I would like to have a short\r\nsitting, not over 15 minutes, as she should not get tired. But if this comes\r\noff, it might be well not to ask any questions regarding the things that have\r\nbeen coming to you. If anything comes, well and good. But since I know\r\nthe answers to several questions, I think it is best to wait until you might\r\ntake it up again. We have got hold of something very good and should be\r\npatient. Don't you think so.''Yours sincerely,\r\nDonald X.\"\r\nFrom enquiries made by Mr X it was ascertained (i) that Marguerite\r\nFoote 's middle name began with A, but it was not ascertained that it was\r\nAlice ; (2) that she was treated at a hospital known as Kensington Hospital,\r\nbut died not at Kensington, N.Z., but in a neighbouring district ; (3) that\r\nJames and Robson both knew they were ill when on the voyage mentioned,\r\nbut that nothing could be ascertained about any bet between them.\r\nFurther investigations in this case were ended after June 20th, 1945,\r\nowing to the severe operation and subsequent long convalescence of Miss\r\nCummins.\r\nSeveral points of interest would seem to emerge from a study of this case. One of the most important is that facts have been given in the automatic\r\nscript which were not only unknown to Miss Cummins and myself, but\r\nalso unknown to Mr X. The latter is the only individual who could\r\nreasonably be regarded as being in possible telepathic communication\r\nwith the automatist while writing these facts. But this hypothesis does not\r\ncover the statement apparently indicating James's death, over three weeks\r\nbefore it occurred.\r\nSo far as we know, we had never heard of Walter Robson. It is of\r\ninterest to note that the characters of both Marguerite Foote and Sheila\r\nShipton are accurately described. As these two women were entire\r\nstrangers to us, it appears that these descriptions could only have been\r\ngiven by someone who knew them both.\u2014\" Astor \"describing Marguerite\r\nand the latter describing Sheila.\r\nMAY 1947 Mass Experiments in tlie Psi Cognition of Drazvings 43\r\nIt is of interest to note that Astor appears to have acted as reporter of\r\nMarguerite's remarks at these sittings. If this is accepted as the manner\r\nin which the communication was conducted, it may explain the discrepancy\r\nbetween fact and statement when Marguerite is alleged to have said she\r\ndied at Kensington, whereas she was in hospital in Kensington and died at another place not far olf. Perhaps readers will agree that this case is the more interesting because\r\nof the illustration in this case, of a very human failing\u2014inaccurate reporting.\r\nWhen analysing evidence one should always compare it with the\r\nbehaviour of human beings. So often the sceptical investigator appears to assume that the hypothetical communicator must be infallible. If he is fallible, that is to say, makes inaccurate statements, then the communicator\r\nis considered by sceptics to be an invention of the medium's subconscious\r\nmind. If he is infallible and makes accurate statements, it is often assumed\r\nthat the subconscious mind of the medium is wholly responsible for the\r\nalleged communication. Cryptacsthesia or invention accounts for all the\r\nphenomena, the communicator is never there!\r\nE. B. GiBBES.\r\nMASS EXPERIMENTS IN THE PSI COGNITION OF\r\nDRAWINGS\r\nBy D. J. West\r\nAcknowledgment\r\nThe experimenter wishes to place on record his great indebtedness to Mr M. T. Hindson, who willingly undertook the laborious task of scoring\r\nall the drawings, and gave unstinted practical help throughout the experiments. Mr Hindson is already known to members of the Society for his\r\nwork in judging drawings in Mr Carington's experiments.\r\nIntroduction\r\nThose who have followed or been engaged upon experiments in psi\r\ncognition are more or less generally agreed (at least on this side of the\r\nAtlantic) that the ability to divine by telepathy or clairvoyance the order of\r\na randomly arranged pack of cards is a rare one. It seemed, when the\r\ncard-guessing campaign was first launched by Ina Jephson, that statistics might reveal a latent faculty in most people. Later work in conjunction\r\nwith Besterman and Soal showed that when adequate precautions were\r\ntaken no results were obtained in tests on groups of unselected percipients. Dr Soal's Herculean labours over many years, as well as many\r\nsporadic unpublished trials, confirm the impression that good cardguessers are a rarity. In earlier days the Americans made the claim that\r\nabout one person in five was a successful card-guesser ; but, judging by\r\nrecent comments in the Editorials of the Journal of Parapsychology, their\r\npresent view is much more conservative.\r\n44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1947\r\nTable\r\nNo. TARGET CONTROL PERCIPIENTS\r\nof\r\ntrial Subject Subject Manning Fletcher Wretich\r\nI Million I Church 2 Cat (2) Bell (2)* -(2)\r\nbell 2 1 umbler 3 World 4 Pear (4) Key (3)* Shape (4)\r\n3 Piano 5 Crown 6 Cube (\u2014\r\n)\r\nLamp- Hat (6)\r\nshade (6) 4 Spectacles 7 Basket 8 Candle (8) Swan (7) Bottle (8)\r\n5 Bath 10 Teapot 9 Book (10) Pillarbox Lamp (9) (9) AD Penny 12 Envelope 1\r\n1\r\nFlower (12) Ship (11) Plate (12)\r\n7 Snake 13 Horse- 14 Teaspoon Bow (13) Book (13)\r\nshoe (13) 0 Electric 15 Weighing 16 Clock (15) Bridge (16) Spoon\r\nlight bulb scales (15)\r\n9 Broom 18 Switch- 17 Caterpillar Shovel (18) Spoon\r\nback (18) (18)\r\n10 Key 20 Hook 19 Bullrushes Window Plate (ig)\r\n(19) (20)\r\nSCORE 5\/9 5\/10 4\/10\r\nTOTAL SCORE : 50 EXPECTATION : 48.5\r\nIn striking contrast to the needs of card-guessing, choice of percipients seems not to matter when drawings are used. Carington concluded from\r\nhis great work in the paranormal cognition of drawings that a degree of\r\npsi capacity existed in the population at large which could be detected by\r\nany conscientious experimenter. The present experiments are an attempt\r\nto demonstrate this generalised psi faculty.\r\nIt was decided not to use Carington's catalogue method of allotting scores based on empirical probabilities. It does not seem beyond dispute\r\nthat Carington's catalogue would be valid for a dilTerent group of percipients working some years later. The passage of time, particularly such\r\nan eventful time as the war years and their aftermath, will inevitably\r\nmake some items more popular and others less so. A simpler method of\r\nassessment, one that took into account general resemblances as well as palpable hits, seemed more appropriate for the proposed demonstration.\r\nThe method used was a variation of the time-honoured \" matchingtechnique \", which has the advantages of essential simplicity and self- evident reliability.\r\nThe First Experiment\r\nA small-scale preliminary test Some weeks previous to the experimental session, twenty objects\r\ncapable of being illustrated were chosen randomly from a dictionary and\r\nMAY 1947 Mass Experiments in the Psi Cognition of Drawings 45\r\nI PERCIPIENTS {continued)\r\n1 Uiiddingtoii dentlClLi levvy EOVgitlCDl i\\eisey\r\nDustbin (2) Pitcher (2) Garden Crown * Tree (i) Tumbler * \u2014 (\u2014\r\n)\r\nseat (2) (2) (2) Trowel (3) Wineglass Teapot Hand- Book (3) Chair (3) Dome\r\n(3) *(4) rail (4) (\u2014\r\n)\r\nFence (5) Candle (6) Ship Pail (5) Cistern (5) Head (5) Cross\r\n(5) (6) Bicycle (7) Cucumber Cherry Parasol Whip (7) Flask (8) Candle\r\n(7) (7) (7) (7) Pencil (9) Glass (9) Cart Book Boxing- Scissors Flower\r\n(10) (10) glove (9) (9) (9) Clothes- Telegraph Table Knife Hammock Pail (12) Shovel\r\nhanger (12) pole (11) (n) .(12) (II) (12)\r\nLoaf (14) Pliers (14) Ring Picture Feather Boat (13) Book\r\n\\ ^4\/\r\nCake (16) Top-hat Shapes Cutlass Sickle (15) Book (16) Fork\r\n(15) (16') \\^ J\/ Saw (18) Plume (18) Boat Flag Gibbet (18) Knife (18) Tele-\r\n(17) (17) phone\r\n(17)\r\nChest of Spoon (19) Shoe Barrel Wheel (20) Wringer Books\r\nDrawers (20) (19) (19) (20) (19)\r\n6\/10 4\/10 4\/10 5\/10 8\/10 6\/10 3\/8\r\nequals palpable hits on one or other of the controls or targets.\r\ndrawn by the experimenter. They were placed in envelopes numbered\r\nI to 20. On 12 July, ten of these envelopes were selected at random (by\r\ntossing a coin) for use as target drawings. The other ten drawings were\r\nused as controls. The target cards v\/ere removed from their envelopes,\r\nscrutinised by the experimenter, and then replaced. This was to ensure\r\nthat the subjects of the target drawings would be more firmly implanted\r\nin his mind than the controls.\r\nThe experiment took place at the Society's rooms on 18 July, 1946.\r\nTen percipients took part and Mr. Denys Parsons acted as invigilator.\r\nD. J. W. acted as agent. He sat in a separate room and concentrated on\r\nthe target drawings one by one. After the attempted transmission of each\r\ndrawing, when all the percipients had recorded their guesses, Mr Parsons\r\nsummoned the agent. D. J. W. then opened one of the controls, and\r\nbrought it and the target drawing into the room, and showed them both\r\nto the percipients. Each percipient was required to try to say which was\r\ncontrol and which was target. The following table shows the subjects of\r\nthe target, control and guess drawings for each of the ten trials performed.\r\nThe numbers represent the choice of the percipients when asked to distinguish between target and control. The scores represent the numbers\r\nof correct choices (p equals h). They are close to chance expectation.\r\nAll the drawings were then given to an independent judge, Mr M. T.\r\nHindson. He was not told which member of each pair of originals was\r\n46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1947\r\nthe control, or which was the target. He scored all the percipients'\r\nattempts against all the originals, both targets and controls, giving three\r\nmarks for a \" palpable hit \", two marks for a \" plausible hit \", and one for\r\na \" resemblance \". The results were as follows :\r\nScore on targets ----- 7\r\nScore on corresponding controls - - 11 Total Score over the other nine controls 54\r\n>) )) )> )i )> 1) targets - 45\r\nThere is no excess score on the targets as opposed to the controls. The\r\nfact that the average score is smaller on the targets and controls not\r\nimmediately in use is no evidence of psi ; it is probably accounted for by\r\nthe fact that in scoring the judge paid rather more attention to the immediate target, and its corresponding control, than to the rest of the drawings.\r\nWe must conclude that in the small number of trials concerned the\r\npercipients showed no appreciable ability to distinguish between target\r\nand control.\r\nThe Second Experiment\r\nThat the First Experiment yielded no detectable psi effect was of no\r\ngreat significance, because it was such a small-scale trial. In the Second\r\nExperiment a much larger number of percipients took part, the target\r\ndrawings were widely spaced in time of exposure, and the scoring system\r\ndid not make use of ambiguous controls.\r\nAbout 200 notices were circulated among S.P.R. members and their\r\nfriends asking for co-operation in an experiment in telepathy. Two drawings were to be exposed in the Society's library, one at 7.30 p.m. and the\r\nother at 8.00 p.m. on Sunday, i December, 1946. No information was\r\ngiven about the nature of the drawings except that they would represent\r\n\" common objects \". Participants in the experiment were requested to send in their impressions on two separate pieces of paper labelled respectively No. I and No. 2. The drawings were chosen by D. J. W. about a week beforehand. He\r\nopened a dictionary and selected at random the first drawable word,\r\nrepeating the process for a second word. Each was illustrated with a rough sketch in ink. The first word chosen was \" Trough \", the second\r\n\" Foot \", and these were written in large capitals on their respective\r\nillustrations. The first drawing showed a gutter-shaped receptacle supported on straight trestle legs, the sort of thing used by animals for drinking purposes. The second drawing depicted an unclad human right\r\nfoot, viewed from the inner side. The two drawings were put away in a private place. No-one was told where they were, or even that they\r\nexisted.\r\nAt 7.30 p.m. on I December, the drawings were taken out and D. J. W.\r\nplaced the first one, the Trough, on the desk in the Society's library. He\r\nsat staring at it leisurely, keeping his mind as blank and restful as possible.\r\nSo as not to allow his attention to wander, he very slowly prepared a tracing of the drawing. At 8.0 p.m. the second drawing wass ubstituted\r\nfor the first and the process repeated. At 8.30 p.m. the drawings were put\r\nMAY 1947 Mass Experiments in the Psi Cognition of Drazvings 47\r\naway again. D. J. W. was alone the whole time, and nobody else saw the\r\ndrawings.\r\nIt was hoped that displacement effects would not be so marked as to prevent percipients distinguishing between two drawings spaced at half- hour intervals. On 2 December, the tracings of the two originals were posted to Mr\r\nM. T. Hindson, who once more kindly consented to act as judge in marking the drawings. Mr Hindson was requested to keep the tracings private,\r\nand in fact no-one else was told what the originals were until all the guesses\r\nhad been received. Mr Hindson himself was not informed of the order\r\nof the originals, that is he did not know while he was marking the drawings\r\nwhether foot or trough was the first original.\r\nSome percipients recorded impressions of more than one object for each\r\noriginal. Where possible these were split and counted as separate guesses\r\nas if they had been received from different percipients. Some percipients\r\nfailed to record any impression for one or other of the originals. For these reasons the guesses were not quite evenly distributed between the two\r\noriginals.\r\nMr Hindson was asked to compare every drawing with both originals,\r\nand to record any resemblance he observed as follows :\r\nPalpable Hits\u2014when the percipient's drawing plainly represented the\r\nsubject of the original.\r\nFair Resemblances\u2014when the drawing is closely connected with the\r\nsubject of the original, e.g. shoe and foot. Faint Resemblances\u2014when there is some detectable association between drawing and original.\r\nMr Hindson's scores are shown in the following table :\r\nTable H\r\nNumber Hits on Target Hits on Target\r\nof Guesses Trough Foot\r\nWhen Target Palpable Hits I 0\r\nFair Resemblances 5\r\nI Aim Was 192 Faint Resemblances 24 0\r\nTotal 30 I Trough Expectation 24.8 1.6\r\nWhen Target\" Palpable Hits 0 0\r\nFair Resemblances 0 2\r\nAim Was > 171 < Faint Resemblances 17 0\r\nTotal 17 2\r\nFoot Expectation 22.2 1.4\r\nThis table shows no significant deviation from chance expectation, but\r\nsuch as it is the deviation is in the right direction.\r\n48 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research may 1947\r\nWhen Mr Hindson had finished scoring tlie drawings, he numbered\r\nthem I to 363, and all markings which indicated the target aim (i.e. first or second guess) were cut away. A record was kept of which was which, but\r\nwhen the second scorer Mr F. W. Masham saw the drawings he was not\r\ntold the target aims. He was shown the originals, but like Mr Hindson he was not informed which was which.\r\nMr Masham was asked to run through all the guesses marking them Tor F according to whether he thought they were more like \" Trough \" or\r\nlike \" Foot \". If he showed a tendency to match the drawings against the\r\noriginal at which they were aimed, that would be evidence of telepathy.\r\nThe actual result was as follows :\r\nTable HI\r\nTarget Aim\r\nT\r\nTarget Aim\r\nF Total\r\nScorer Matched 122 92\r\nT (Expt'n 1 13.2) (Expt'n 100.8) 214\r\nScorer Matched 70 79\r\nF (Expt'n 78.8) (Expt'n 70.2) 149\r\nTotal 192 171 363\r\nX2 eq. 3.54 with one degree of freedom.\r\nWith Yates' correction p is approx. 0.075, which is approaching the\r\nborderline of significance. The result is promising and suggests that a\r\nrepetition would be useful.\r\nIn putting forward an experiment of this type as a demonstration of psi\r\nwe are making one assumption. We have shown that there was a slight excess of associations with \" trough \" appearing as first guess, an excess of associations with foot in the second guesses. We are assuming that\r\nthere is no reason for this sequence to be observed in the absence of a telepathic factor. It does not seem a very big assumption ; for sequence\r\npreferences, while understandable with numbers and cards, are not ex- pected to the same extent in qualitative material. However, it would be\r\npossible to argue somewhat as follows : Most people when asked to make a guess will think of somethingcommonplace. Asked for a second guess they will think of something more abstruse. One might expect an excess of common objects among the\r\nfirst guesses, and a comparative excess of uncommon things in the secondguess. As the figures of the experiment show, the associations of trough were commoner than those of foot. One would therefore expect the\r\ntrough associations to predominate in the first guesses even in the absence\r\nof telepathy.\r\nIn order to answer this objection, we must demonstrate by a control\r\nexperiment that in the absence of trough and foot as originals there is no\r\nMAY 1947 Mass Experiments hi the Psi Cognition of Drawings 49\r\ntendency to draw trough first and foot second. This has in fact been done,\r\nusing as controls the drawings of the Third Experiment (see below) with\r\nthe following result :\r\nTable IV\r\nScoring by M. T.

An experiment of this kind is useful for picking out promising percipients. Some 200 percipients had taken part in the experiment, but only one scored a direct hit. She was Miss P. M. Clark, an Oxford undergraduate, who w'as known to D. J. W. through her success in informal\r\ndrawing experiments with members of the Oxford S.P.R. Miss Clark did\r\nnot actually describe her drawing as a trough. It was in fact a stool with\r\ntrestle legs, but it so closely resembled D. J. W.'s drawing that Mr Hindson\r\nfelt he must regard it as a palpable hit.\r\nThe Third Experiment\r\nThe Second Experiment having yielded a statistically inconclusive\r\nresult, it seemed logical to try a repeat experiment on a larger scale. For\r\nthis purpose, D. J. W. wrote to Mr Rex North of the Sunday Pictorial,\r\n5\u00b0 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may i 947\r\nwho was at the time conducting a series called, \" We Investigate the Unknown \". A description of the Second Experiment was enclosed, and it was suggested to Mr North that he might care to attempt a similar experiment using the readers of his paper as subjects.\r\nOn Sunday, 22 December, 1946, an announcement appeared in the\r\nSunday Pictorial that on Christmas Day, Wednesday, 25 December, 1946, an experiment in thought transmission would be carried out. Two drawings of simple objects would be used. Mr North would concentrate on\r\nthe first drawing from 4.0 to 4.30 p.m., and on the second drawing from\r\n4.45 to 5.15 p.m. Readers were asked to post their guesses to Rex North.\r\nOn Thursday, 2 January, 1947, the drawings were sent to D. J. W. for\r\nstatistical analysis. There were only 298 attempts, a somewhat disappointing response from a paper with so wide a circulation. It is possible that some of the drawings were lost. In a description of the experiment which\r\nappeared in the columns of the Pictorial on Sunday, 5 January, 1947, it was stated that twenty people had chosen \" cat \" for the second drawing.\r\nD. J. W. was able to find only four cats, counting both first and second\r\ndrawings. Moreover, the two guesses which D. J. W. had himself sent in were not returned for scoring.\r\nThe 298 drawings were scored by the same method as was used in the\r\nSecond Experiment, with the following slight modifications :\r\n(1) Composite drawings were not split, but were counted as single\r\nguesses.\r\n(2) The drawings were shuffled so as to separate the two attempts sent\r\nin by each percipient.\r\n(3) The numbers showing target aims were removed from the drawings\r\nbefore being given to the judge, Mr M. T. Hindson.\r\n(4) Mr Masham having left London, the forced matching scoring was\r\nperformed by Mr R. A. Caldwell, another member of the Society.\r\nTable VI\r\nHindson Scores\r\nHits on second\r\nHits on first original original\r\n{Cross within a circle) {Circle on\r\nstraight line)\r\nDrawings aimed Palpable Hits 3 2\r\nat first Fair Resemblances 4\r\n6\r\noriginal Faint Resemblances 4 35\r\n(151 attempts) Total - 1\r\n1\r\n43\r\nExpectation - II. 15 46.11\r\nDrawings aimed Palpable Hits 3 6\r\nat second Fair Resemblances 4\r\n8\r\noriginal Faint Resemblances 4 34\r\n(147 attempts) Total - 1\r\n1\r\n48\r\nExpectation - 10.85 44.89\r\nMAY 1947 Mass Experiments in the Psi Cognition of Drawings 51\r\nTable VII\r\nR.

In these circumstances, it is hardly worth while to perform a cross check control to demonstrate that there is no special sequence preference for cross before\r\ncircle.\r\nThe Fourth Experiment\r\nIt was considered that the completely negative result of the Sunday\r\nPictorial experiment might have been due to the close resemblance\r\nbetween the two originals\u2014both of which contained a circle\u2014which\r\nmitigated against the percipients' chances of distinguishing between\r\nthem.\r\nIn order to test this matter experimentally, the drawings obtained in the\r\nSecond and Third Experiments were shuffled together and renumbered\r\n(i to 661). They were given to a fresh judge (Miss Mountford, a member\r\nof the Society) who was asked to force-match them against either trough\r\nand foot, or circle on a straight line. Miss Mountford was not asked to match any of the drawings against the original cross. This original had\r\nbeen one of those used in the Third Experiment which took place on\r\nChristmas Day, and it was considered that to demonstrate an excess of\r\ncrosses at that time would contribute nothing to the evidence for psi\r\ncognition.\r\nThe great objection to all cross-matchings between separate experiments is the question of topicality. It might be that for some subtle reason circle was more topical on Christmas Day, 1946, than it was on\r\nI December and if this were so it would give rise to a spurious positive\r\neiTect. The result of Miss Mountford's matchings is set out in the table\r\nbelow :\r\n5a Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1947\r\nTable VIII\r\nTarget\r\nTrough and Foot\r\nTarget\r\nCircle\r\nMatched against\r\nTrough & Foot\r\n163 (Expt. 146.6) 104 (Expt. 120.4) 267\r\nMatched against\r\nCircle\r\n200 (Expt. 216.4) 194 (Expt. 177.6) 394\r\n363 298 661\r\neq. 6.97 with i degree of freedom. p<.oi\r\nIt must be noted that this inter-experiment matching is statistically\r\nindependent of the previous matchings.\r\nThe Fifth Experiment\r\nIt was considered that the results of the Second and Fourth Experiments were sufficiently promising to warrant a repetition on a larger scale. Accordingly, all members of the S.P.R. were circularised, and notices were printed in Light, Prediction, The Two Worlds, and Psychic News, to the effect that at 9.0 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. on 7 February, 1947, an experimenter at the S.P.R. rooms would concentrate his thoughts upon the\r\ndrawing of some simple object. The American S.P.R. was also notified,\r\nand altogether a gratifyingly large response was obtained.\r\nThe originals were : No. i at 9.0 p.m. \" Statue \"\u2014portrayed by a Greek\r\nfigure of a naked man ; No. 2 at 9.30 p.m. \" Maze \"\u2014portrayed by a\r\nstraight-line maze of the picture-puzzle variety.\r\nThe scoring procedure was the same as for the Third Experiment,\r\nexcept that Mr Hindson did the forced matchings as well as the scoring by\r\nresemblances. The results are shown in the following table :\r\nTable IX\r\nResemblances to Target Statue\r\nResemblances to Target Maze\r\nAimed Palpable hits\r\nat Fair Resemblances\r\nStatue.

The result of the Second Experiment had\r\nseemed promising, and its statistical significance was apparently con- firmed by the Mountford cross-matchings. It was confidently expected\r\nthat the Fifth Experiment, w-hich was on a much larger scale, would produce highly significant deviations. Instead, it yielded a result in close\r\nagreement with chance expectation.\r\nThe hope that at last a simple repeatable method of demonstrating psi\r\nhad been discovered was quickly dashed. The fact that the most recent\r\nand carefully conducted large-scale experiment failed to confirm previous\r\nresults suggested a possible fallacy in those results. The figures which had seemed so promising were the forced matchings\r\nof Masham and IMountford. In the latter case, it was realised that there was a flaw. When the drawings of the Second and Third Experiments\r\nhad been shuffled together and renumbered it was not possible to eradicate\r\nthe numbers w^hich they had previously received for the purpose of Mr\r\nHindson's scoring. Moreover, the numbers put on for the Second and\r\nThird Experiments were in different colours. Here, then, was a clue\r\nwhich would have enabled Miss Mountford to divide the drawings into\r\ntwo target categories without any reference to supernormal resemblances.\r\nIf she had remembered a statement made to her over the telephone, she\r\nwould have known that the trough and foot experiment had produced some 360 responses. Observing that the red numbers ran from\r\nI to 363, she could have deduced that these drawings were aimed at trough and foot, and consequently the rest were presumably to do with\r\nthe circle. When this possibility w-as put to her. Miss Mountford asserted that any\r\nsuch train of reasoning in her mind must have been unconscious, and she\r\ndid not believe it could have occurred. There is, however, a piece of\r\nevidence to suggest that something of the sort did in fact occur. Besides\r\nforce-matching all the drawings Miss Mountford was asked to note any\r\npositive resemblances to either target. Her scoring of resemblances was\r\nas follows :\r\nTable X\r\nWhen drawing Appreciable Resemblances to : was aimed at : Trough and Foot Circle\r\nTrough & Foot 55 (E-^pt- 57-3) 84 (Expt. 81.7) 139\r\nCircle 65 (Expt. 62.7) 87 (Expt. 89.3) 152\r\nIf a genuine effect in the drawings was the basis of Miss Mountford's\r\nscores it is extraordinary that her markings of appreciable resemblances\r\nshould be in complete agreement wdth chance, and her only significant\r\nmatchings should be on those drawings which bore little or no resemblance\r\nto either target. The most likely explanation is that in the latter case.\r\n54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY 1947\r\nwhen the matchings were only a matter of guesswork, her choice became\r\ninfluenced unconsciously by normal clues in a way that was impossible\r\nwhen she was preoccupied with actual resemblances.\r\nIn the case of the Masham forced matchings, retrospective investigation showed that here, too, normal clues were available. In the Third and\r\nFifth Experiments the cutting of the drawings to conceal the target aim was\r\ndone effectively, either by D. J. W. himself or under his supervision at the\r\nS.P.R. rooms. In the Second Experiment, although the actual numbers\r\nwere cut oft, certain clues still remained. For instance, in many cases, where percipients had put both attempts on the same sheet of paper, it was still possible to distinguish which was the top half of the sheet ; and\r\nthis presumably contained the lirst attempt. D. J. W. picked out seventy\r\ndrawings in which he thought he could tell what the target aim had been.\r\nIn fifty-seven of them he was correct. Mr Masham would have had to guess which target came first, but having\r\ndone so correctly (p eq. -J ) there was then every likelihood of unconscious\r\nbias leading to a spurious result. It is, however, only fair to state that\r\nMr Masham did not appear to have used some of the most obvious clues.\r\nThe Sixth Experiment\r\nIt remains only to recount briefly one final experiment, equally negative\r\nin result, in which Miss P. M. Clark (the percipient who scored the only\r\nhit in the Second Experiment) was tested individually. During a visit to the S.P.R. rooms Miss Clark tried to reproduce ten target drawings which\r\na friend of hers looked at one by one in an adjacent room. Later, Miss\r\nClark tried to reproduce (from a distance of some 100 miles) ten drawings\r\nconcentrated upon by D. J. W. at set times during January and February,\r\n1947.\r\nNo appreciable resemblances were obtained. Pairs of attempts, coupled\r\nwith corresponding pairs of targets, were posted to Mr Masham to see if he could match them correctly. Of ten such pairs he got only six correctly\r\norientated. A similar type of matching score by R. A. Caldwell was also\r\nnegative.\r\nThe final conclusion must therefore be completely negative. In all experiments the results were in agreement with chance expectation, with\r\nthe two comparatively minor exceptions of the Masham and Mountford\r\nmatchings ; and in both these cases there was strong presumptive evidence that unconscious bias was the explanation of the deviations.\r\nIt is important to notice that cross scoring by resemblances between the\r\nSecond and Third Experiments yielded a null result. This shows that\r\ndisplacement effects, causing confusion between drawings used on the same evening, is not the explanation of the failure. Another explanation of the failure is that D. J. W. may be a bad agent.\r\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration that Mr Rex North of the\r\nSunday Pictorial was no more successful, and that in the last mass experiment at the Society a subsidiary agent was used in addition to D. J. W.\r\nMAY 1947 Correspondence 55\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nSir,\u2014Discussions of experiments on psycho-kinesis seem sometimes to assume that psj'cho-kinesis can only be demonstrated if the dice used are unbiassed. This is not the case. If each face is taken as target an equal\r\nnumber of times it can easily be shown by simple algebra that the deviation\r\nfrom mean chance expectation of the total number of hits is independent\r\nof the bias of the dice. Let a, b, c, d, e, \/, be the probabilities of the faces i, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6\r\nrespectively turning up in any one throw. Then a + b + c + d + e +f= i. Suppose that in 6A' throws, during which each face has been aimed at as target N times, one obtains A' hits. If the dice were assumed to be unbiassed the mean chance expectation would be and the deviation from\r\nexpectation would be A' - A'. These values will be exactly the same if the\r\ndice are biassed, for the mean chance expectation of hits on i will be Na,\r\non 2 will be A^^ and so on. The total number of hits expected will be,\r\ntherefore, N x {a + b + c + d + e +f) which equals Nx i. The expected number of hits and, therefore, the deviation of any given score from expectation\r\nwill thus be independent of the bias of the dice if each face is taken as target an equal number of times.\r\nThe variance will not, however, be independent of the bias of the dice. If the dice were unbiassed this would be taken to be 6A^ x 1\/6 x 5\/6 = 5A^\/6\r\n(if 6A' is the number of throws). But if the dice are biassed the variance\r\nwill be different for different target faces, e.g. with i as target it will be\r\nNxax{i -a) = N{a-d^). The variance of the total will be the sum of\r\nthe variances on different target faces, that is, it will be I!N'{a - a^) =\r\nN{Za-Zar). iTa = i, so the total variance is A^ - ATa^. If the dice are unbiassed, this quantity Zd^ becomes 1\/6 and the variance will be 5AV6 as above.\r\nThis correction for bias in the variance is not generally made. This is unimportant for two reasons. The effect of bias is to reduce the variance, so ignoring the correction means that the variance tends to be overestimated\r\nand therefore the significance of any deviation is underestimated which\r\nis an error on the right side. Also the correction required is very small.\r\nFor example, the relative probabilities of falls of the difTerent faces in the\r\nresults shown in Table 2 of \" A large series of PK tests \" by Gibson,\r\nGibson and Rhine in x\\i& Journal of Parapsychology, December 1943, are : 160, -163, -165, -166, -171, and -175. The sum of the squares of these is \u20221668 which makes the true variance -83 3 2 A^ instead of -8333 A' as calculated\r\nby the ordinary formula. The error of rather more than -01% is, of\r\ncourse, altogether negligible.\r\nThat results obtained when each face is target an equal number of times\r\nare independent of the bias of the dice is perhaps sufficiently obvious.\r\nSome of the North Carolina results have, however, been obtained under\r\nconditions in which this equality was not secured. These are commonly\r\ntreated as if this inequality rendered the results necessarily dubious. It\r\nis, however, possible to treat them also by a similar method which renders\r\nthe deviation independent of bias, although the method I suggest has not\r\nbeen used by those who have published such results.\r\n56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY 1947\r\nLet A, B, C, D, E, F be the number of times that the targets i, 2, etc. have been thrown for. If A, B, etc. are unequal and the dice are biassed\r\nit is obvious that the probable total score (Aa + Bb + ttc.) will not be\r\nindependent of a, b, c, etc. But if the scores for each target face are weighted by factors inversely proportional to the number of times that\r\ntarget face has been aimed at, one obtains a new total which will be independent of bias. The weights, for example, could be MlA, MjB, MIC,\r\netc. The chance expected score for face i will then be MIA x Aa = Ma,\r\nand the chance expected total score will be M{a + b + c + etc.) = M. That\r\nis, it will be wholly independent of the bias of the dice. But by thus weighting the scores we have also weighted their variances\r\nand the change of variance must be taken into account in estimating\r\nsignificance. By weighting the score on target i by multiplying by the factor\r\nMIA we have weighted its variance by the factor (MIA)\". Since the original\r\nvariance of throws on target i was A{a - a^), the contribution of its variance\r\nto that of the weighted total score is {MIAYxA{a-a^) = M\\a-a'^)IA.\r\nThe variance of the weighted total will, therefore, be M'^S[{a - a^)IA\\.\r\nTo illustrate this method I will take the data given in table 2 of the\r\narticle by Gibson, Gibson and Rhine referred to above. This was a series\r\nof witnessed experiments by three subjects with a total of 24,132 throws\r\nof 6 dice each showing when worked out in the ordinary way (ignoring\r\nbias) a total deviation of + 1,057, with a critical ratio of 7*46. Examination\r\nof the table shows that subjects most commonly chose to throw for high\r\nfaces and that these were the ones that fell uppermost most often. The\r\nquestion to be decided is whether, on the hypothesis that the high faces\r\nfell uppermost most often as a result of bias, the observed deviation was\r\ndue to the subjects choosing as targets those faces which were favoured by\r\nbias. The exact numbers for scores on each target face are not given in\r\nthe article which gives only average scores, but Professor Rhine has very\r\nkindly sent me the details of exact scores. The results are as follows :\r\nTarget faces 12345 ^ Total\r\nNo. of single\r\ndice throws 24,804 12,816 15,444 9>684 39,168 42,876 144,792\r\nHits 4,098 2,150 2,630 1,656 6,923 7,732 25,189\r\nOne would have preferred to estimate the bias of the dice from all the\r\nfalls (whether hits or not) but since these were not recorded we must\r\nestimate it from the relative values of the percentage of hits on each target\r\nface. It is no objection to this procedure that the relative frequency of hits might be determined by preferential action of PK on some target faces. We are testing the null hypothesis that there is no PK and on this null\r\nhypothesis relative frequencies of fall will be entirely determined by bias. The question at issue is whether these results can be explained on this null\r\nhypothesis, so for testing significance the null hypothesis is assumed.\r\nThe percentages of hits on each target face are : ; ,\r\n16-54 1678 17-04 17-10 17-67 18-04\r\nMAY 1947 Correspondence 57\r\nDividing the values by their total (103-17) gives us the following esti- mates of bias :\r\nThese are the estimated probabilities of each face on a single throw. It will be seen that (as is usually the case) the general direction of the bias\r\nis in favour of the higher numbers.\r\nIn order to weight the score to reduce it to the value it would have had\r\nif each target face has been thrown for an equal number of times we must\r\nmultiply the observed deviations by a weighting factor inversely proportional to the number of throws on that target. The denominator chosen\r\nfor the weighting factors makes no difference to the final result but it will be convenient to make it the average number of single throws per target,\r\ni.e. 24,132. The weighting factors will, therefore, be 24,132\/24,804,\r\n24,132\/12,816, etc. To three decimal places, these weighting factors are :\r\n\u2022973 1-884 1-562 2-495 -616 -563\r\nMultiplying the observed number of hits on each target face by these\r\nfactors we get :\r\nTarget faces i 2345 6 Total\r\nWeighted hits 3,987 4,048 4,109-5 4,127 4,265-5 4,352 24,889\r\nThis weighted total of 24,889 is smaller than the observed total of hits 25,189 since the preponderant influence of the favourite throws of 5 and 6 on which scoring was heaviest has been eliminated. This may be regarded\r\nas the score that would have been obtained if all targets had been aimed at the same number of times and the total number of throws was still 144,792.\r\nIt may be directly compared with the mean chance expectation of onesixth of 144,792 (24,132). The deviation from expectation is +757 (instead of 10,578 as calculated from the unweighted total).\r\nAn exact estimate of significance can be made as suggested earlier by\r\nallowing for the elTects on the variance of the bias and of the different\r\nweighting of the hits on difl^erent faces. For this we need to calculate the quantities {x - x\") where x is the bias\r\nfor each face. We have :\r\nx (bias) -1604 -1627 \"1650 \"1657 \"1714 -1748\r\nx^ -0257 -0265 -0272 -0275 -0294 -0306\r\n{x-x'^) \"1347 -1362 -1378 \"1382 -1420 \"1442\r\nThis must be multiplied by the weighting factor for each target face, i.e. by MlA, MjB, etc. where M is the mean frequency of target faces. This\r\ngives :\r\n(jv - X-) X weighting factor -1311 -2566 -2152 -3448 \"0875 -0812\r\nTotal = 1-1 164\r\nTarget face\r\nEstd. bias \u20221604\r\n123456-1627 -1650 -1657 -1714 '1748\r\nTotal\r\nI -0000\r\n58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may i 947\r\nThis total is the quantity MZ[{a - a\")IA] which muhiplied by M gives the\r\nvariance :\r\nI -1 164 X 24,132 = 26,941.\r\nThe standard deviation will be the square root of this, which is 164. This\r\ngives a critical ratio of 757\/164 = 4-62. This corresponds to a chance\r\nprobability of less than -00001 which, though less impressive than that\r\ncalculated when bias is ignored, is still more than adequately significant.\r\nThe object of this letter is to point out that PK results are not necessarily\r\nvitiated by inequality of target faces and to show how they can then be\r\ntreated in a way that makes the results independent of bias in the dice.\r\nIt remains true, of course, that if the subjects are given free choice of\r\ntarget face, such results might be explained by precognition. F\"or this reason and also because statistical treatment is much simpler, it is to be\r\nhoped that future investigators will adopt the method of equalising target\r\nfaces. Yours faithfully,\r\nR. H. Thouless\r\nMadam,\u2014In my paper \" Attempts to detect clairvoyance and telepathy\r\nwith a mechanical device \" {Proc, XLVIII, 1946, pp. 28-31), I concluded\r\nthat no evidence of Psi faculty was found in 24,000 trials with 44 subjects.\r\nThere was, however, a single isolated significant score. Because of its isolation I did not attach any importance to it, and did not mention it, but on further consideration it seemed worthy of publication.\r\nThe percipient was Basil Shackleton (Soal's \" Mr B.S.\"). Six sessions\r\nunder conditions of pure clairvoyance were conducted, with 175 successes (p=i\/5, expected 176) in the 882 trials. Attention was then turned to conditions which allowed telepathy, i.e. the spy-hole was opened and an\r\nagent was stationed at it. Two hundred trials were made at each session,\r\nand at the fourth session a postcognitive (\u2014i) score of 58 was obtained.\r\n(Postcognitive hits are possible on 199 of the trials). A score as high as\r\nthis would be expected only once in about 757 similar sessions of 200 trials. A correction must be made for the fact that the results were scored in three different ways (i.e. on the target, precognitive, and postcognitive).\r\nThis gives 252 to i. Now the equivalent of 120 sessions were in fact performed so it was almost an even chance that a deviation of this magnitude would be obtained in the course of the experiment.\r\nThere are just two facts in favour of a Psi interpretation, (i) The\r\nhigh score was obtained with a proved sensitive, known to give frequent\r\ndisplacement scores usually precognitive but sometimes postcognitive,\r\n(see Soal and Goldney's report, Proc. , XLVII, 1943, pp. 21-150). Shackleton only contributed 10% of the total trials. (2) I was accustomed to note\r\ndown any remarks made by the percipient during the session. On this occasion at about guess no. 25, Shackleton said : \" I feel I am getting one\r\nbehind all the time.\" Previous scores had not shown a tendency in this\r\ndirection, and the percipient had not made any other remarks about\r\ndeviating from the target.\r\nI\r\nr\r\nMAY 1947 Correspondence 59\r\nFour further sessions under telepathic conditions gave resuks close to chance expectation. The percipient was only told about success or\r\nfailure at the end of each 200, or occasionally 100 guesses.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nDenys Parsons\r\nMadam,\u2014Mrs Heywood's interesting and persuasive letter in the MarchApril number raises a crucial question. Now that many members of the\r\nSociety are convinced that ESP is proved, Mrs Heywood seems to consider exclusion on grounds of evidence no longer necessary. We incline to the opposite view especially if it is intended that such cases should be\r\nprinted in the Journal.\r\nThe respect which the Society's publications have won in the past has\r\nbeen due largely to the policy of printing only the best attested cases. It would be a great pity if acceptance by the Society's Editor could no\r\nlonger be any guarantee of quality. There are as it is plenty of spiritualist\r\njournals ready to supply the demand for less well authenticated cases. We\r\nfeel that the standard of corroboration in material published by the\r\nSociety is already low enough. However convinced one may be that\r\ngenuine cases exist, it can hardly be denied that cases of unconscious\r\nexaggeration, pathological hallucination, faulty memory and hoaxing also\r\nexist. Only by maintaining a consistently high standard of evidence can one hope to eliminate these side effects and avoid mistaking the phsycological for the psychic.\r\nThose contributing cases should make sure they are confirmed in every\r\nway possible. The aid of the Research Officer can now be enlisted in\r\nseeking new cases and following up any sources of independent corroboration.

John Godley of BalHol College, Oxford, for\r\nthe following report of his three prophetic dreams. Mr Godley is well\r\nknown to Mr Parsons, a member of the Council of the Society, to whomthe account was sent in September 1946. The cases are particularly well\r\nsubstantiated. Mr Godley and certain of the witnesses were interviewed\r\nby Mr Richard Wilson, another Council member, who has added some\r\ncomments. The racing details\u2014dates, times and odds\u2014have been checked\r\nby reference to The Times.\r\nHow TO Back Winners\r\n\" On the night of Friday, March 8th 1946, I dreamt w-hat many would\r\nlike to dream\u2014that I was looking at the next day's evening paper. I dreamt that I was looking at the next day's racing results, with all the\r\nwinners and prices written out in full. And in the dream I noticed that\r\ntwo horses had won w'hich I had backed unsuccessfully on their last outing, and I remember being annoyed in the dream because I had missed\r\nthem this time. The names of the horses were Bindal and Juladin ; and\r\nin my dream they both started at 7-1.\r\n\" When I woke up, I remembered the dream, but of all the results I had dreamt I could only remember those two names : Bindal and Juladin.\r\nI thought no more about it till later in the day, when I happened to look\r\nat the morning paper and discovered to my surprise that both these horses were running that very afternoon. I told a number of my friends, who all advised me to back them ; some of them backed them themselves. So,\r\nafter some consideration, I did the same, in singles and in a double.\r\nPerhaps it was foolish to do so ; but I felt it would be even more\r\nfoolish to miss such an opportunity, if by any chance the horses should\r\nwin.\r\n\" Bindal was the first of the two to run. I bought my evening paper,\r\nand the first part of my dream had come true. So I promptly put all my\r\nwinnings on to Juladin, which was running (as in my dream) in the last race ; then I spent an uncomfortable hour or two waiting for a late paper.\r\nWhen at last it came, I somehow felt quite confident that I would win;\r\nand, sure enough, Juladin also had been successful. The two horses had\r\nstarted at 5-4 and 5-2, so that the odds for the double were 7I-1, a figure\r\nvery close to the 7-1 of my dream. My friends and I won over thirty\r\npounds between us.\"\r\nSome further points\r\n\" In the dream, Bindal appeared more or less at the top of the page,\r\nJuladin right at the bottom. This was not as it happened in fact, for\r\nBindal was running in the 2nd or 3rd race at the principal race meeting\r\nand Juladin in the last race at the secondary race meeting.\"\r\n64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\nDream II For a week after this first dream, I slept with paper and pencil beside me. If I dreamt again, I was determined to remember it all. But nothing\r\nhappened. And after a while I forgot the whole incident, and gave up\r\nhope that it would ever happen again. \" But two nights before the Grand National (Wednesday, April 3rd\r\n1946), almost the same thing happened. Again I dreamt that I was\r\nlooking at the racing results. But this time, when I awoke, I could only\r\nremember one of the winners\u2014Tubermore ; and next day there was no\r\nsuch horse running. But on the following day in the first race at Aintree,\r\nthere was a horse called Tuberose ; and the two names were so alike that\r\nI decided to take a chance. With my brother and sister I put on three\r\npounds each way ; and that afternoon Tuberose came in at 100-6.\r\nBetween us we won just over sixty pounds.\r\n\" I had never heard of Tuberose before that day. It was an unconsidered outsider. I have watched its fortunes since, and it has never won\r\nanother race.\"\r\nIn a telephone conversation with the Research Officer, 8th June, 1947, Mr\r\nGodley explained that he was staying at his home in Ireland at the time of\r\nhis second dream. As the papers would not be delivered at his home in\r\ntime for him to find out before the race whether Tubermore was running,\r\nhe rang up the local postmistress, who gave him the information about\r\nTuberose.\r\nDream III \"\r\n'\r\n\" Once again I tried hard to dream more winners. Once again I gave\r\nup all hope of succeeding. Months went by and nothing happened ; then, on the 28th July, 1946, I dreamt again. \" This time it was different. I was in Oxford at tlie time, and in my\r\ndream I went into a certain hotel to ring up my bookmaker. It is my\r\ninvariable habit to get the racing results from the evening paper, when I am interested in them, but on this occasion, in my dream, I decided to get them by contacting my bookie. I was smoking a cigarette, and the\r\ncall-box seemed very stufl^y. When I got through, I said to the man who\r\nanswered me :\r\n' This is Mr Godley. I wonder if you could tell me the\r\nresult of the last race?' And his reply was ' Certainly, sir : Monumentor\r\nat 5-4 '. Then I woke up ; it was two o'clock in the morning and I was\r\nextremely sleepy ; but I managed to persuade myself to get up and write\r\ndown the name so that I should remember it in the morning. When I looked at the paper at breakfast time, I discovered that the favourite for\r\nthe last race that 'day was called Mentores.\r\n\" Again I told my friends, and I again decided to back the horse. The\r\nname, though substantially the same, v\/as different from that in my dream.\r\nI decided that as, in the dream\u201e, I had rung up my bookie, I would have,\r\nin fact, to reproduce the conditions. So at five o'clock I went along to the\r\nhotel, and waited till the result of the race would be known.\r\n\" At ten past five I lit a cigarette. Then I went into the call-box and\r\nput through a call to London. It was very stuffy in the call-box. At last\r\nI got through. - . !\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Forecasts of Horse Races 65\r\n' This is Mr Godley ' I said. ' I wonder if you could tell me the result of the last race?' ' Certainly, sir ' he replied :\r\n' Mentores at 6-4.' Once\r\nagain, everything happened in general as in the dream ; once again I was wrong in the minor details ; but once again I had done it, and though this was a smaller success (my winnings were jTG) it had brought the total profit to my friends and myself well above the hundred mark.\"\r\nFurther Points\r\n\" In the case of Bindal and Juladin, I knew the names previously, but\r\nhad no idea they were running the following day. I had never heard of\r\nTuberose. There is a horse called Tubbermore, whose name I knew\r\nbefore the dream. It ran about seven days after the second dream, and I backed it for luck and it did not win. I had never consciously seen the\r\nname Mentores. There is a horse called Momentun (not very like) whose\r\nname I did not know before. I backed this too, and it didn't win either\r\nin fact it came in last in a big field.\" In answer to the Research Officer's questions, Mr Godley gave the\r\nfollowing additional information : \" The prophetic dreams were no different in character from ordinary\r\ndreams. I am rather spasmodic in having dreams that I can remember\r\nwithout conscious effort, sometimes having a great many, sometimes very\r\nfew.\r\n\" I can recall no previous psychic experiences whatever. There is, on\r\nthe other hand, very strong evidence of psychic faculty on the part of my\r\nMother, who about the time of the 1914-18 war, had a very remarkable\r\nseries of fulfilled (precognitive) dreams. I have had no further racing\r\ndreams.\r\n\" I remember the actual odds because I remember how much money I won. The newspaper was not preserved on each occasion (The odds have\r\nbeen checked by reference to The Times\u2014RW). It is not surprising, for\r\nexample, that I can remember in the second case, that we put on ,^3 each\r\nway and won ^62 los. od., from which it is an easy mathematical operation to discover that the odds were 100-6, etc., etc. I remember the\r\n' dream ' odds because they approximated to the actual odds ... it doesn't seem to me to require a great feat of memory to remember such\r\nthings.\"\r\nFor corroboration of the first dream, the names and addresses were\r\ngiven of six witnesses, four of whom benefited financially. Upwards of\r\ntwenty undergraduates also benefited. A short interview was given by one\r\nof them, Mr M. Pilch, who confirmed that he profited by the precognitive\r\nknowledge. Another, Mr A. Richardson, sent a corroborative account.\r\nExtracts are given below :\r\n\" All that I say in this letter is strictly true, and where I am at all uncertain, I say so. \" One Saturday morning in last Hilary Term, I was speaking to John\r\nGodley outside Holywell Manor where we both lived. He said : 'I'm\r\nfaced with a frightful problem. I had an extraordinary dream last night ; there was a list of horses, and the horse at the top of the list was called\r\n66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jUNE-jULY 1947\r\nBindal and the horse at the bottom of the hst was called Juladin. In my\r\ndream I backed these two horses and they both won, and I won money at odds of 7 to I.'\r\nJohn Godley went on to say :\r\n\" ' Now the extraordinary thing is that, although, of course, I follow\r\nracing, I knew both of these horses existed. I did not know they were\r\nrunning today, and at breakfast I looked in the paper and I found that\r\nBindal is due to run in the 4 o'clock at Wetherby and Juladin in the\r\nI o'clock at Plumpton.' \" (Note : A. R. persuaded John Godley to put ^^i on for him).\r\n\" Later I told several of my friends about the dream, and John Godley\r\ntold various other people, too. I think four other chaps put money on as a result. Altogether at least twenty to thirty people must have known\r\nwhat had happened. As it was, I received ^2 17s. 6d.\u2014los. on each\r\nhorse, and they both won. But I believe that owing to odds shortening, a double on the horses, did produce exactly 7-1 and that John Godley\r\nhimself won at these odds.\r\nIt is the only time I have ever backed a horse, and I know nothing\r\nabout racing.\"\r\nAlan Richardson ,\r\nDream II was substantiated by the following statement made by two\r\nmembers of Mr Godley's family, both of whom benefited :\r\n\" We Certify that (to the best of our knowledge) the attached article\r\n' How TO Back Winners ' (together with the addition ' some further\r\npoints ') is a truthful account of an actual happening.\"\r\nsigned John Godley\r\nWynne Godley\r\nKatharine Komierowska\r\nThe Research Officer also interviewed a person who remembered being\r\ntold about the Tuberose dream before the race was run. Dream III was not so clear, and although John Godley was willing to\r\nrisk money on it himself, he was less ready to involve other people. Mr\r\nGodley mentioned it on one occasion when about six people were present,\r\nbut he did not know their names and none of them has as yet come forward\r\nto corroborate the account.\r\nMr Wilson adds the following comments :\r\nA case of this sort does not prove precognition. It might be telepathy\r\nfrom some people who think that one horse is going to win. This is especially so when the horse is ' held back ' and the odds shorten at the\r\nlast moment.\r\nIn this case, Bindal, Juladin and Mentores were either favourites, or mentioned (in The Times) as possible winners. Tuberose was an outsider.\r\nThere was no last minute shortening of odds.\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Forecasts of Horse Races 67\r\nIn estimating the value of ostensibly supernatural material, care must be\r\nexercised in order to make an unbiassed judgment. The researcher\r\nalways has to exercise judgment at some stage ; in experimental researches,\r\ntwo methods are used to make his judgment unbiassed ; in card-guessing\r\nexperiments, there are only two possibilities\u2014right or wrong\u2014so it is easy\r\nto judge. In drawing experiments, someone who is otherwise not\r\nconnected with the experiment has to do the scoring.\r\nIn spontaneous cases, neither method is possible. Judgment must be\r\nexercised after the case, and without full knowledge of the details. But\r\nthe Godley case goes a long way to meeting this difficulty. The precognitive content was realised and acted upon before its fulfilment. This\r\nis more convincing than cases in which the precognitive content is only\r\nrealised after the event.\r\nResearch Officer's Note\r\nThere can be no shadow of doubt, at any rate in the first two cases, that\r\nMr Godley made the predictions described, and said they were based on\r\ndreams. He made no secret of the matter, and in the first case many\r\nBalliol students benefited, while in the second his own family made the\r\nmost of the forecast. There is, however, one possible normal explanation which does not seem to have been mentioned. Mr Godley studies racing, and presumably\r\nknew a lot about horses. It is not inconceivable that he had picked\r\nup hints at some time. Mr Godley declares that consciously he did not\r\nknow that Bindal and Juladin were running and that he did not even know the name of Tuberose. Even so, there may have been some\r\nsubconscious awareness that these were good horses, in which case the\r\ndreams might have been only an externalisation of this subconscious\r\nconviction.\r\nDr. Thouless points out in connection with this case that while the\r\ncombined odds on the four dream horses amount to the significant figure\r\nof 347 : I , this estimate depends upon the four recorded instances being\r\nthe only horses betted upon as a result of dreams, and not just a selected\r\nsample of those that happen to have won. Mr Godley states that these were all his racing dreams, but it is of course impossible to obtain\r\ncorroborative testimony on the point.\r\nPostscript\r\nAfter this case had gone to press, Mr Godley reported still another\r\ndream. In a statement dated June i8th, 1947, he writes : \" On the night of the 13\/14 June, 1947, I dreamt that I was at a race meeting. I w^as standing near the finishing post when the runners came down towards the finishing post. I recognised the colours of the leading\r\nhorse\u2014or rather of its jockey\u2014to be those of the Gaekwar of Baroda, and\r\nI knew the jockey to be the Australian, E. Britt. Baroda's horse won easily. \" Almost immediately afterwards, in my dream, the bookies were shouting the odds for the next race. There was one horse which was being\r\nheavily backed and was at long odds on. It was called ' The Bogie '. A\r\n68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\nlittle later the next race took place. People began shouting ' The favourite\r\nwins ', ' It's the Bogie ', etc., etc. The horses reached the finishing post,\r\nand The Bogie was an easy winner.\r\n\" On reference to the morning papers when I got up, I at once looked for\r\nany horse that was owned by Baroda and ridden by Britt. N.B.\u2014Britt is Baroda's regular jockey and rides most of his horses. At Lingfield that\r\nafternoon there was only one horse running in the Baroda colours, and\r\nthis was being ridden by Britt. It was called Baroda Squadron. In the\r\nnext race, the 4.30, the forecast favourite was a horse called The Brogue.\r\nThe name seemed similar enough, and I backed them both.\r\n\" Baroda Squadron won by a short head at 11- 10, and The Brogue won\r\nby two lengths at 9-1 on, thus confirming the fact in my dream that the\r\nsecond horse would be at prohibitive odds.\r\n\" I did, in fact, make two mistakes. In my dream, there was a considerable number of runners\u2014ten to fifteen\u2014in the first race. In fact, there were only three\u2014Baroda Squadron started joint favourite with Invasion.\r\nSecondly, in my dream, the Baroda horse won very easily\u2014by three or four\r\nlengths. In fact, it 'was an extremely close race, and my choice only got\r\nthe verdict by a short head.\r\n(Signed) John Godley \"\r\nIn an accompanying letter, Mr Godley described how he had obtained\r\ncorroboration : \" I took the trouble on this occasion to make sure that the whole matter was perfectly evidenced. I told four responsible friends on the morning\r\nof the race, and at 2 o'clock in the afternoon I made out an account of the\r\ndream and signed it. This was witnessed and signed by two independent\r\nwitnesses, including the postmaster at a local post office. It was sealed at 2.30 p.m. and deposited in the post office safe. At 3.45, I rang up the\r\nSunday Pictorial offices and notified them of the dream. The Daily Mirror\r\nsent a reporter to interview me yesterday\u2014vide this morning's edition of\r\nthat paper!\u2014and in his presence the sealed statement was opened and in the presence of the postmaster concerned. This statement is now in the\r\nDaily Mirror offices, but they have promised to return it.\" On June i6th, 1947, an official of the Daily Mirror telephoned the\r\nResearch Officer and confirmed the fact that Mr Godley had notified the\r\nnewspaper at 3.45 p.m. on Saturday, June 14th, that Baroda Squadron\r\nwould win the four o'clock, and The Brogue the four-thirty that day.\r\n(See Daily Mirror for June i8th, 1947.)\r\nIt will be noticed that these two additional forecasts, interesting psychologically, add little to the statistical significance of the combined prediction. Baroda Squadron was a favourite, and The Brogue had the\r\nextraordinary odds of 9 to i in its favour.\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 A Case of Premonition 69\r\nP. 308. A CASE OF PREMONITION\r\nThe following case came to us through Dr Soal to whom the contributor\r\n(here called Mrs Violet Morley) wrote in the first instance. Her letter,\r\ndated 26.11.46, reads as follows :\r\n\" [Some years ago] I had a picture\u2014in my waking consciousness\u2014of my\r\neldest son [Herbert^ dead in the bath. This haunted me so much that I became rather a nuisance to him, for when he was having a bath I made\r\nall sorts of excuses to knock at the bathroom door to see if he wanted\r\nanything. I said nothing to him of the picture I had seen, but I told my\r\nyoungest son \\Peter'\\ at the time, and I used to get him to go to the bath- room door to see if his brother was alright. \" This went on for a couple of years, when Herbert went away. He\r\nreturned for a holiday and it all came into my mind again\u2014the picture was so vivid, I could not get it out of my mind.\r\n\" One evening, he was going to play tennis, and was having a bath before\r\ngoing out. His younger brother, just before going out, wanted to see him,\r\nso he opened the door. . . . For a long time I heard him whistling and\r\nsinging. I was dressed to go out also, but I could not bring myself to leave\r\nhim alone in the house. After a while I heard the water run out of the\r\nbath and waited to hear him singing as usual. But there was no sound,\r\nand as I listened outside the door I heard heavy breathing. I went in and\r\nthere he lay, exactly as I had seen him two years before ; the chain had\r\nbroken off ; (he must have grasped it as he felt himself falling), he was\r\nalmost purple and only the whites of his eyes showed. I had to leave him\r\nalone and run out. ... I stopped a motorist to ask him to fetch a doctor.\r\nThe doctor cam.e, and between us we got him to his room. What had\r\nhappened was that during the night something had gone wrong with the\r\ngeyser\u2014and the bath-room window (which had been open) must have\r\nbeen shut by a draught. Fortunately, though I never thought of carbonmonoxide\u2014the first thing I did was to open all nearby windows and\r\ndoors, otherwise I should also have gone under.\r\n\" Without boring you with further details\u2014with the aid of a bottle of\r\nneat whisky\u2014the doctor brought him round and he is alive and well\r\nto-day.\r\n\" Now wJiat possible explanation can there be for this.' We are an Irish\r\nfamily\u2014my mother was accredited with second sight\u2014and most of us are more or less psychic.\"\r\nMrs. Morley was interviewed at her home by Mr. F. W. Mashan, a member of the Society, who reports as follows :\r\nI stayed about half an hour, during which time Mrs V. Morley introduced her daughter-in-law Mrs Kathleen Morley\u2014wife of her elder son\r\nHerbert. They both seemed convinced of the reality of the pre-vision. \" Mrs V. Morley has had plenty of previous (and subsequent) premonitions most of which, she says, although veridical, are not of evidential\r\nvalue to anyone except herself. In fact, both of them regaled me with\r\nseveral incidents of varying degrees of ' spookiness '.\r\n7\u00b0 Joiiriial of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\n\" They have forgotten the name of the doctor who attended Herbert. \" The incident happened about 14 years ago. [Herbert] was in his\r\ntwenties at the time. She said nothing to him (as he only scoffed at his\r\nmother's psychic stories) but she told lots of other people, particularly her\r\nyounger son [Peter] and Herberfs fiancee (now wife) Kathleen. Mrs\r\nMorley and her daughter-in-law were both reluctant to mention the matter\r\nto Herbert who is apparently very sensitive on the subject. \" There is no doubt in my mind that they are both sincerely convinced\r\nthat this incident occurred. She didn't pass it on to the S.P.R. until she was encouraged to send it to Dr Soal by reading about his work in the\r\npress last year.\"\r\nThis premonition is particularly interesting because of the improbability\r\nof chance fulfilment of such an unusual impression. It is a pity that the\r\ncase was not reported for so long, and that there is no corroboration from\r\nthe main party concerned or from the doctor. It might be suggested that\r\nthe unsatisfactory nature of the geyser gave rise to apprehensions in Mrs Morley's mind, but that would not explain why her apprehensions were all centred upon Herbert.\r\nCASE : VERIDICAL INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH\r\nM. Ill A OUIJA BOARD\r\nWe are indebted for the account which follows to Mrs Grace McCombie\r\nYoung, wife of a member of the Society. The incident happened nine\r\nyears ago, but letters written at the time have been preserved. Mrs Young\r\nwrites as follows :\r\n\" When staying with friends in Ireland, at Belville Park, Cappoquin,\r\nin 1928, Marcelle C. (the daughter of the house) and myself were operating\r\na ouija board and our hostess, Mrs D. C. was taking notes. We obtained\r\nthe following ' communication '\r\n:\r\n' Child dead, June, June.' \" At first I was unable to place this, then I recalled that my first cousin\r\nMuriel M. had had a child named June. Some weeks previously, a cable\r\nhad come from Canada to the child's grandmother, when we were with\r\nher, saying ' June dead, bringing body home '. \" Mrs C. then suggested that we should ask what the child had died\r\nof. This was done, and the board spelled ' Boiling water, boiling\r\nwater '. \" This answer seemed so silly we ceased further operations and nothing more was obtained. \" Subsequently I received a letter from a friend, dated October 12th,\r\nsaying that she had heard from the dead child's aunt what had happened\r\nShe wrote as follows. ' I suppose you have heard what killed Muriel's\r\nlittle girl\u2014falling into a tub of scalding water.'\r\nPLATE 1\r\nTHE POLTERGEIST AT NETHERFIELD\r\nPhotograph of the clock w hich caused\r\nthe \" phenomena \"\r\n\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Veridical Information 71\r\n\" Later and more detailed information showed that the child was about\r\nto be bathed by a nurse who had filled a bath with scalding water, and\r\nfinding it too hot for use, she went to fetch some cold water to cool it. On\r\nher return she found that the unattended child had fallen into the bath\r\nof scalding water, from which she received burns which proved fatal. \" The interest of the ' communication ' appears to lie in the fact that I had not myself at that time any conscious knowledge of the cause of that\r\nchild's death, nor, in so far as I can judge, had any other person in Ireland\r\nany such knowledge, which only subsequently transpired from the receipt\r\nof letters from Canada.\"\r\nIn answer to questions by the Research Officer, Mrs Young wrote again\r\nas follows : \" Most certainly no one in the house where I was staying knew even\r\nof the death of the child. The friends with whom I was staying did not\r\nknow any of my relatives. June's grandmother lived [in another county]. ... I had not met Marcelle C. until a week or so previously. ... So little did I think of the child's death that I had forgotten its name, and Marcelle\r\nC. and I both agreed we knew no one of the name June. It was only on\r\nquestioning the ouija board and it suddenly said ' Muriel ', that [I realised who it was].\"\r\nThe letter mentioned by Mrs Young, which told of the child's death\r\nby scalding, was enclosed with her account. Also enclosed was a letter from Mrs D. C, date 12th October, in which she writes : \" How extraordinary about the little child. I wish I could find the\r\nnotes but fear I burned them at the time. Are you sure it did not say too\r\nthat she fell into boiling water? I seem to remember thinking at the time\r\nthat it was romancing and that the burning was unlikely.\"\r\nIn assessing the value of a case of this kind, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat death by scalding with boiling water is regrettably common among\r\ninfants.\r\nThe following report is sent to us by the King's College Society for\r\nPsychical Research of Durham University.\r\nCASE : THE POLTERGEIST AT NETHERFIELD 1\r\nAllen J. Sharp\r\nDennis B. Cameron\r\nThe first report of \" paranormal \" disturbances at Netherfield appeared\r\nas a front page article in the Northern Echo in July 1946, and was followed\r\n^ For reasons that will be obvious from the account, real names are not used\r\nin this report.\r\n72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\na little later by a shorter article in the Sunday Dispatch. In both cases an\r\nurgent request was made for investigators and in viev\/ of this our treasurer,\r\nMr Cameron, offered his services, and those of the present writer, on behalf\r\nof this Society. The offer being immediately accepted, Friday 19th found\r\nus on our way to the mining village of Netherfield which lies in South\r\nDurham.\r\nTravelling there by bus, our appearance quickly centred upon us the\r\nattention of the other passengers who were more than willing to talk about\r\n\" the ghost house \". A popular theory was that the whole affair was a hoax on the part of the owners in order to secure a new house. It became very obvious that they were not popular in the village, due, we learned later, to their keeping\r\nthemselves aloof. The house was the last in the row, a field on one side and an adjoining\r\ncottage on the other, the houses being built in pairs. There were only\r\nthree rooms, two on the ground floor and one above. The upper room\r\nwas lit by a small window at the front, the roof at the back sloping down\r\nto the level of the floor. Miss C. (aged 43), the owner, had recently undergone a serious operation and was in bed most of the day. This was in the sitting room. The\r\nother two occupants were her sister, Mrs R. (41) and Brenda (21) who\r\nwas Mrs R.'s daughter. Both slept in the room above.\r\nWe were surprised to learn that the knocking had occurred spasmodically for three years, about a year after they took the house. Miss C.\r\nsaid that the noises appeared to come from the ceiling below the bedroom.\r\nWe were led to understand that this \" ceiling \" was merely cardboard\r\npapered over. Above this were the beams holding the floorboards of the\r\nbedroom.\r\nHaving seen us settled in the kitchen the family retired about midnight.\r\nWe had been led to expect the beginning of manifestations about one\r\no'clock. We thought, however, that they were a little early when at 12.20 a.m. two sharp cracks came from the tallboys, due most probably to the room cooling. We were keeping a small fire on through the night but\r\nthe temperature had dropped from 80 to 77\u00b0 F. At 1.15 a.m. Miss C. called us through into the front room. After a moment we heard a knock, faint but quite distinct. It sounded like hollow\r\nwood being struck and indeed appeared to come from the ceiling. The\r\nsound was repeated a few times and we went upstairs to the bedroom.\r\nHere the sound was most deceiving, each tap seeming to originate in a different part of the room. Mr Sharp returned to Miss C. leaving Mr\r\nCameron alone in the bedroom (alone that is apart from its sleeping\r\noccupants). While I talked with Miss C. the knocking became frequent.\r\nShe told me that she suffered from recurring nightmares. This she\r\nadmitted was quite enough to explain the incident reported in the newspapers when she had been dragged downstairs by the \" ghost \". She\r\nlater commented that she had no doubt that the entity was a woman as \" a man would'nt bother to stay awake all night \"! About three o'clock I heard a new sound like feet crossing the floor above on tiptoe. This I presumed to be Mr Cameron, but it subsequently\r\ntranspired that Mr Cameron had not been moving at that time but had\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Poltergeist at Netherfield 73\r\nheard a noise which he described as Hke wire being dragged across the\r\nfloor. We heard the noise again after he had rejoined me downstairs. It was then 4.15 a.m. and quite Ught so we returned to the bedroom.\r\nWe heard more knocks and at 4.55 a.m. another new sound Hke the\r\nrolling of a heavy weight on the floor, the occupants of the room being\r\nunder our observation at the time. One minute later a succession of light\r\ntaps occurred. This appeared to end the performance and at 5.15 a.m., having heard no more, we went outside to photograph the house. Mr\r\nThompson, the owner of the adjoining house (to whom his neighbours in question had not spoken for three years) was just leaving for work and\r\nwe had a short conversation with him. He said that he didn't know\r\nthat we had been staying the night next door. He had never heard the\r\nknocking.\r\nBefore we left we inspected the bedroom and found that the chair by\r\nthe bedside produced a noise when struck not so loud but identical with\r\nthe noises of the night. Being hardly in a position to openly exploit such\r\na suspicious discovery we decided that a second visit was necessary to clinch the case. Upon our second visit three weeks later we determined to exclude all chance of fraud and while leaving the furniture in whatever convenient\r\nposition it may have been placed we arranged to photograph the bedroom\r\nwith cameras operated from any room in the house.\r\nOver supper there were four distinct knocks, and a lively evening was\r\npromised. In accordance with the policy of reducing natural causes to a minimum we asked that the alarm clock which stood on the kitchen\r\nmantelpiece through the day and was taken to the bedroom at night be\r\nleft downstairs.\r\nAbout 1.30 a.m. we were surprised to hear taps in the room beside us, originating, we discovered, from the clock which was standing on the\r\nchair beside us. Having returned it to its usual place in the bedroom\r\n(upon the chair which had excited our suspicion on the first visit) we\r\nreturned downstairs and after a few moments were rewarded with a surprisingly loud knock. By 2.30 a.m. we had not only heard more\r\nknocks but the peculiar footsteps which occasionally preceded them (see\r\nPlate I). The following explanation became at once obvious. The clock spring\r\nreleasing in jerks caused the clock to knock on the chair, a sound magnified\r\ngreatly by the space between floor and ceiling. We at first imagined that\r\nthe clock actually bounced at each knock but later we conjectured that\r\nthe noise originated inside the clock. This might explain why the source\r\nof the sound is not at once apparent. Naturally the \" phenomena \" did\r\nnot begin until the family had retired since it was then that the clock was wound to its fullest, the disturbances ceasing when the spring had released\r\nsufficiently. The footsteps were due to a peculiar ticking which preceded\r\nthe knock. The knocks which we had heard, at supper we were able to produce by placing the clock on the kitchen mantlepiece, and it is by no means inconceivable that the succession of raps at the end of our first visit was not a last effort on the part of the spring which would be about\r\na third unwound. There remains the heavy rolling sound. This cannot\r\nbe attributed even to this clock. We cannot discount the possibility of its\r\n74 Jotimal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\nbeing engineered by Miss C. who was alone in the room below, though by\r\nwhat means I cannot imagine. In our opinion it was probably the result\r\nof some innocent activity by Mr Thompson, who was preparing for work\r\nnext door.\r\nIn correspondence afterwards. Miss C. maintained that noises had\r\ncontinued after removal of the clock, but further investigation was refused,\r\nwhich seems significant. We are quite sure that none of the phenomena\r\nwas paranormal.\r\nA CASE OF APPARENT RETROCOGNITION\r\nThis case was sent to the Society by Mr J. S. Spence in 1940, but owing\r\nto war conditions was not followed up at the time. The Research Officer\r\nhas now been able to get in touch with Mr Spence and he interviewed him\r\non 29 May 1947. Mr Spence has kindly given permission to print the\r\ncase but he points out that his memory of it has become too hazy for him\r\nto give further details, as he could have done when he sent it in. When it occurred he had not read \" An Adventure \" ; on doing so eighteen\r\nmonths later he thought it worth reporting his own case as being of an\r\napparently similar type.\r\nMr Spence 's Statement\r\n*\r\nOn an unusually warm, sunny morning in March 1938, I walked down\r\nto a Devonshire cove, which impressed and elated me by its tranquillity\r\nafter the rush and noise of London. I strolled casually across the beach,\r\nexploring the rocks and pools, towards the end of the headland on the far\r\nside. As I went the atmosphere, which had at first so much appealed\r\nto me, grew heavy and depressing. Eventually, in a little inlet in the\r\nheadland, I came upon a cave which seemed large enough to enter on hands and knees. I felt very much afraid but curiosity drove me\r\ninto it. A few yards down the tunnel I noticed daylight ahead and\r\nafter a further two or three yards I found myself in a vast cave which\r\napparently extended to the further side of the headland as I was only in semi-darkness.\r\nAlthough there was clearly no one in the cave I had an unpleasant\r\nfeeling of being watched and scrambled back to the cove through the\r\nlittle tunnel as quickly as was consistent with self respect. I now sought\r\nand found a little path by which I could clamber up the cliff and once on\r\ntop I set out to climb to the summit of the ridge, less than a quarter of a mile away. I now felt even more depressed and lonely than before and\r\nhad the impression that something was straining at a leash so that one\r\nTO I SORROWMEAD\r\nPARK\r\n- + -+- + - + >+ - + - + _^.,\r\n(Thurs.Vday) > ,f \/cliff PATH ^ '~ ' ^\r\n'\r\n.'

Thursday\r\n76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\ncould almost hear the noise that that something made, trying to break the\r\nbonds. However, I went on slowly, through waistdeep bracken and\r\nbramble. After ten minutes or so I came upon a long old-fashioned type\r\nof wall made of slabs of stone and earth\u2014no mortar. The stone looked\r\nvery fresh and there were no creepers on it. As I passed through a gap,\r\nleft as if for a gate, I noticed that the wall stretched about 80 yards or so over grass, brambles and bracken to the edge of the cliff, which was there\r\nvery high. Almost at right angles to it another wall sloped steeply\r\ndown the hill and disappeared among the scrub and bracken on the\r\nheadland.\r\nI was puzzled why the walls should be there but decided that if I were\r\nnot to be late for lunch I must hurry on to my objective, a point where,\r\naccording to a large scale ordnance map, I would find a solitary tree beside an old gate. On looking ahead I saw neither the tree nor the gate, but a ^ mass of stunted trees, bent by the prevailing wind. The heat was terrific and the stillness awful so I hurried on to get into the shade. As I went\r\nforward the atmosphere became less charged and less tense and for the\r\nfirst time since I had entered the cove about half an hour earlier, I heard\r\na definitely real sound : a seagull flew over my head screaming. Then,\r\nto my surprise, I saw ahead the lone tree and gate and I was also surprised\r\nto find on looking back, that the grass seemed greener and fresher and the\r\nbracken less than when I had passed through it. The wall was apparently\r\nhidden behind the brow of the hill. My head was aching less and I could\r\nbreathe more easily. When I got home I felt astonishingly weary and my\r\nusual good appetite had quite disappeared.\r\nThe next day I decided to set forth on the same walk about the same\r\ntime. The sun was even warmer than the day before but the odd depressing feeling and the strange stillness had gone. On reaching the cove I was surprised to find the tide right up, for the day before it must have\r\nbeen low to enable me to cross the beach to the cave in the headland.\r\nSurely, I thought, the tide cannot alter more than an hour a day. I turned\r\nback and climbed the hill behind towards the summit of the ridge and the\r\nwall. On reaching the top I was amazed to find myself near the edge of a\r\ncliffy, and with no sign of a long new wall, and I thought I must have gone\r\nwrong. There was certainly a very old scrap of wall covered in ivy, with\r\nanother portion leaving it at right angles, but within a few feet it broke\r\noff at the edge of the cliff. My eye then followed the branch wall, expecting to see it disappear in scrub, but it, too, stopped abruptly, very dilapidated, at the edge of the cliff. For a while this puzzled me : then I gave it up and walked on. Almost\r\nat once I was startled to see the lone tree and the gate. I was certain I had\r\nbeen in the same spot the day before and had seen only a mass of bent and\r\nstunted trees and I knew I had seen a long new wall. I came to the\r\nconclusion I must have taken the wrong path and I decided to return the\r\nnext day with a torch and a camera and explore the cave and find the\r\nwall. How I had come to miss my way in such a small area was beyond \u2022 me.\r\nI reached the cove next morning to find the tide fairly full and I could\r\nnot get across to the cave for a couple of hours. I distinctly remembered\r\nthe little inlet in the headland where I had entered the cave at sea level .\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Apparent Retrocognition 77\r\nbut on reaching it there was no cave. I at last found, a few feet up in a\r\npile of shale and hidden by a large boulder, an entrance to what was\r\nobviously a cave, but far smaller than it had been two days before. As a large pile of shale showed signs of collapse and there was hardly room\r\nto wriggle in, I decided not to risk it and walked back to find the path\r\nby which I had climbed the cliff. This was not to be seen, but further\r\nalong I found another which led up on to the headland. Here, to satisfy\r\nmyself as to my whereabouts, I made my way through some bracken and\r\nover a stile to the end of the headland and then returned to where I expected to hnd the top of the path by which I had climbed the first day.\r\nThe place, however, looked impossible to get down and I wondered how\r\nI had ever got up, so I decided to go along the cliff towards Dartmouth.\r\nAs I reached the top of the cliff path the atmosphere became charged and\r\nunfriendly again. I had the same tight feeling across my forehead and\r\nfelt the sweat breaking out. There came that peculiar sensation of something straining at its leash. There was no particular sound to this effect, to which I could have stopped\r\nand listened, and possibly logically explained, but I received the impression, on a much larger scale, as it were, of a cart-horse straining at a wagon-load of bricks which it could not possibly drag.\r\nI moved on mechanically through the ferns, which suddenly seemed to have become waist deep again, and it was with considerable difficulty that\r\nI made any progress.\r\nI had forgotten about the wall until I came to it, in front of me with its new-looking slabs of stone, neatly placed into and against each other.\r\nDown to the left it stretched for some way, over grass and brambles and\r\nbracken to the edge of the cliff. Furthermore, another wall jutted away\r\nfrom it almost at right angles, and sloped sharply down the hill, nearly in\r\nthe direction in which I had come, and disappeared amongst scrubs and\r\nundergrowth somewhere on the headland.\r\nI went up close to the wall and walked a few paces forward. I felt giddy, as if looking from a great height, but in front of me, without any\r\ndoubt, stretched the wall. On an impulse, I pulled out my camera, and\r\nattempted to find an object in the view-finder, but my giddiness increased\r\nand I clicked the shutter with very little care. I put the camera back in my\r\npocket and prepared to move forward (see Plate II).\r\nI had gone only one short pace, when I felt my left foot slip, and\r\ngo down as if in a rabbit-hole. The shock threw me off my balance, and\r\nmy left foot twisted so that I felt my body collapse. As I fell, my hand\r\ngrasped wildly and came into contact with tufts of thick coarse grass, and I held on tight. My body came to rest on my twisted left foot,\r\nwhile my right shot into space. For a few moments everything went\r\nblack.\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, I immediately became aware of two things : the shrieking of the seagulls, and the very dangerous position in which I was. Two small sturdy tufts of grass, and a ledge a few inches wide, on\r\nwhich my left foot lay, had saved me from the rocks below. Almost\r\nimmediately above my head was the broken fragment of an old ivy-covered\r\nwall. For some minutes I clung to the grass and dared not move. When\r\n78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947 some composure returned, I realised the seriousness of the position. With\r\ngreat care I gradually wormed my way to a cautious standing position,\r\nthough the whole of my weight, until I could bring my right foot on to the\r\nledge, had to be thrown on to the damaged left. Then I caught hold\r\nof a large tuft of grass further away from the edge of the cliff, tested\r\nit, and pulled my right leg up and on to the top of the cliff. The left leg\r\nfollowed slowly. I dared not look back, but carefully 1 manoeuvred my\r\nway on to my stomach to a safe position some vards from the top of the\r\ncliff. After a few minutes my mind cleared a little. The atmosphere had\r\nreturned to normal, and the tremendous pressure that I had felt had gone.\r\nI looked to the right. The lone tree and gate were in their proper positions.\r\nOut in front, where the wall had stretched, was nothing but space, but some distance out at sea there was a group of rocks.\r\nThen, as if suddenly becoming aware of my recent escape, I got up and\r\nas quickly as possible set off home. Down the slope towards the cove I suddenly remembered the portion of the wall that had jutted out at right\r\nangles, which had appeared to stretch to the headland, to be lost in\r\nbrambles. So I went out on to the headland and after a long search found\r\nnot far from the edge of the cliff and directly in line with the tumbledown\r\nbit, which could be seen on top of the ridge, a fragment of wall, buried in\r\nthe bramble (see Plate II).\r\nComments sent with Statement by Mr Spence\r\nI visited the cove on three consecutive days : Tuesday, Wednesday and\r\nThursday.\r\nThe Atmosphere\r\nThe atmosphere on the Wednesday was normal, and different from the\r\nTuesday and latter part of the Thursday visit. If I got some glimpse of this corner of the world as it was, possibly\r\ncenturies ago, I must have been under that spell only for certain definite\r\nperiods.\r\nOn the Tuesday I felt the oppression as soon as I reached the beach,\r\nand throughout the period in question, until a short while after I left the ridge, and saw the solitary tree and gate, which had appeared as a mass of stunted trees when I had viewed it from the vicinity of the\r\nwall. The Wednesday was a perfectly normal time, although the weather and\r\ntemperature remained the same. On the Thursday, everything was normal until the moment when I turned from the cliff path, because I didn't think I could get down.\r\nThere is httle doubt that the path had disappeared. Instead of a field I found waist-deep bracken. Conditions in the atmosphere became worse\r\nas I reached the summit, where the pressure was terrific.\r\nPLATE II\r\nPhotograph taken by Mr Spence just before he walked off the chft'-edge\r\nPhotograph of old wall mentioned in Mr Spence 's account and taken by him after his experience\r\nA CASE OF APPARENT RETROCOGNITION\r\nPLATE 111\r\nPSYCHIC PHENOMENA IN INDONESIA\r\nPhotographs of thi- knife-cutting episode in the (iimon-tlispersing Ceremonv\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Apparent Retrocognition 79\r\nThe Tide\r\nThis cannot be explained reasonably. On the Tuesday the tide was\r\nright out, a distance of at least 150 yards, and on the Wednesday and\r\nThursday practically full. As it was the same time every day, this is, according to the laws of the tide, impossible.\r\nOn the Tuesday, high tide at Torquay was 9.34 a.m. and there is a difference of about 30 to 40 minutes a day. I checked this at the time\r\nfrom the tide table in Bradshaw's guide.\r\nThe Cave\r\nThis must have some connection with the rest of the experience.\r\nOn the Tuesday the cave was easily found, but not on the Thursday\r\nwhen it appeared that a landslide had occurred.\r\nThe Path\r\nAlters its situation.\r\nThe Field\r\nBetween the cove and the wall is normally covered in grass and primroses in March, but on the Tuesday and Thursday it was thick bracken.\r\nOn the Wednesday, actually, I had walked a long way round : see route on map.\r\nLone Tree and Gate\r\nThese seemed to appear and disappear quite casually. On the Tuesday,\r\nfrom the wall, I saw only stunted trees. Yet I had to go only a short\r\ndistance before the vision cleared and I saw the tree and gate a little way off. I noted too, on looking back, that the ground looked less withered.\r\nThe Wall\r\nThis subject is the most interesting, because of its weird persistence in\r\nbeing so out of place, and because of its perfect transfiguration.\r\nAlthough, on the Thursday, I thought the old portion lay at the end of\r\nthe new stretch, I could not see because of the brambles.\r\nThe Giddiness\r\nThis was obviously due to looking over the edge of the cliff, although I thought I was looking at a field. It is odd that I walked over a \" ghostly path \" and \" ghostly field \" and these did not disappear, but the wall and field at the edge of the clifl: did.\r\nThe danger must have been so apparent to my sub-conscious mind\r\nthat it broke the spell.\r\nAn important point was the discovery, on the Friday, of a fragment of\r\nwall on the headland at X. Some three weeks later a clifi^ fall occurred,\r\ntaking with it the wall marked X in the map.\r\n8o Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\nNowadays the cove intervenes but it seems obvious that the two pieces\r\nof wall formed one continuous length at one time.\r\nThis case is not evidential. We have to take the narrator's word for\r\nwhat happened, for the experience was a solitary one and corroboration is impossible.\r\nThere was a lapse of some eighteen months before the account was\r\nwritten. However, granting the integrity of the witness, it is very difficult to attribute the supposed experience to a trick of memory or other form of\r\nself-deception. There is the photograph mentioned in the account, and\r\nother photographs of the old wall, which Mr Spence has sent to the\r\nSociety. There is the startling fact that at one stage he attempted to step\r\ninto thin air. Moreover, Mr Spence is quite clear that he checked the state of the\r\ntide at once. He also mentioned the incident to his uncle, with whom he was staying at the time. In a note to the Research Officer dated 3 June\r\n1947 this gentleman says : \" I remember that my nephew\u2014Geofl^rey Spence\u2014did mention something of his strange experience at Man Sands\u2014but it is so long ago that I really cannot remember any details whatsoever. All I can say is that I was somewhat amazed at the time. ...\"\r\nThere is considerable psychological interest in a hallucination so strong\r\nthat it caused the percipient to step oflF a cliffy under the impression that he was walking along a path, while at the same time he felt giddy as if standing on a great height. The behaviour of the tide is most curious. While under\r\nthe influence of the hallucination, it seemed to Mr Spence that the tide was far out and that he was crossing the beach, whereas in fact the tide was in and this would be impossible\r\nThis case has much in common with one which appeared in the Journal\r\n(Vol. XXXH, p. 175) where a man and his wife passed a house with black\r\nand orange sun umbrellas in the garden. When they returned it was not\r\nthere. Here, the visionary house had not existed in the past (though conceivably it might do so in the future) whereas it is a reasonable deduction\r\nfrom the circumstances of Mr Spence's experience that the wall and\r\nheadland had at one time been as he \" saw \" them. Both cases are of a very unusual type.\r\nPSYCHIC PHENOMENA IN INDONESIA\r\nAt a discussion meeting held on Wednesday, 14 May 1947, Mr J. H.\r\nBekker, F. R.A.I. , told of some psychic phenomena he had seen in Indonesia. While the details he gave are not evidential, they present an interest-\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 PsycJiic Phenomena in Indonesia 81\r\ning picture of the beliefs of primitive peoples in regard to psychic matters.\r\nSome extracts from Mr Bekker's talk are given below :\r\nDuring the 18 years I lived among the people of Indonesia, I became\r\nacquainted with their customs, ceremonies and religious beliefs, and came\r\ninto contact with supernormal phenomena associated with trance, hypnotism and demoniacal possession.\r\nThe people of Indonesia (better known as the Dutch East Indies) are not a uniform race. They are of various origins and differ greatly in the\r\nstage of development they have reached.\r\nMahommedan religion prevails on most of these islands although it is intermingled with Hindu and Buddhist ideas, as the first influence was\r\nBuddhist and Hindu, especially in Java, Bali and Sumatra. Then there\r\nare some Christians who, however, retain some pre-Christian superstitions ; the remainder are animistic pagans. Animism expresses an\r\nidea that every object of nature is animated by spirits. These animists\r\nbelieve that souls of departed human beings abide everywhere around\r\nthem.\r\nSome of the animists have the idea of a Superior Being, but they do not\r\ngive him worship. Only the medicine-man knows about him. What the\r\npeople are concerned with are the spirits. Day and night they move in a\r\nspiritualistic atmosphere. There are of course the good and evil spirits,\r\nbut no native knows exactly which are the good ones and which the evil ones, which are to be loved and which feared. Usually the spirits of their\r\nancestors are considered the good ones and the spirits of those who were\r\nenemies or whom they have beheaded are the evil ones. The latter ones\r\nare the most feared. Offerings are made both to the good and the evil\r\nspirits, for the former to attract them and for the latter to keep them away.\r\nMaking offerings is the task of the medicine-man, who is the most important person in the community. He is believed to be the intermediary\r\nbetween the people and the spirits. His assistance is invoked on all occasions. He is the weather-maker, the fortune-teller, he appoints the\r\nlucky days for marriages, house-building, planting, harvesting, but his\r\nmost important task is to cure the sick people in the village. With most of\r\nthe primitive people, sickness is believed to be caused by the evil spirits\r\nin one form or another. The ceremonies connected with the cure of sick\r\npeople are varied and intricate and would require too long a time to describe. I will therefore mention one which I have witnessed on the\r\nisland of Celebes which I last visited in 1938.\r\nThe interior of the island is inhabited by pagan tribes. These people\r\nbelieve that disease is caused by the evil spirits which take temporary\r\npossession of the soul. The exorcism of these spirits is the medicineman's task, for he is believed to have the power to communicate with his\r\nguardian spirits and implore their aid to cure the sick. A striking feature in this ceremony is the medicine-man's demondispersing ministrations. Beginning with the usual drum-beating and\r\nincantations, he tries to cut himself with a knife. If he bleeds, his guardian\r\nspirits have not granted him the power to exorcise the evil spirits, and he\r\nmust wait and try again until he fails to draw blood. When he has accomplished this, he cuts the patients in their legs, arms, shoulders and\r\n82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\nstomachs. The object of cutting the patients is not curative surgery, but\r\nto ascertain whether the patient still has the evil spirits in him. If the\r\nknife draws blood the evil spirit is still present and a further treatment is necessary. The cutting was executed by downward strokes, and by\r\ndrawing across the skin (see Plate III.) Although in many cases the knife\r\ndid not draw blood, and there were no marks on the skin afterwards, it seemed to me that the blows were made with strength and were not halted\r\nbefore they reached their destination. My wife, who was also present,\r\nagrees with these observations.\r\nCharms are many and they are employed for different purposes. They\r\nmay be formulae written in Arabic characters, sometimes text of the\r\nKoran or from romances and folklore. Herbs and plants are also used as charms. All charms are believed to be in connection with the spirit\r\nworld. The people have these charms stuck in their belts as a sort of\r\ntalisman.\r\nCharms also accompany the dead to their grave. One is placed in each\r\ncoffin, and the people believe that by this means they remain in communication with their dead relatives. Graves are therefore held in high\r\nreverence, and the least disturbance or violation of the burial place is regarded as a sacrilege. There is no cemetery in our sense ; graves are dug on the rice-fields, on slopes of hills, on open plains, usually near their\r\nhomes, and marked by oblong stones. It happens sometimes that a very\r\nold grave is so overgrown with vegetation that there is no more trace of a grave, and when this place is cleared and a house built, then trouble is sure to come. And here again I have experienced phenomena which are worth mentioning.\r\nI owned a piece of land high up in the mountains, and apart from a few coconut palms there was nothing else there. As it was much cooler in\r\nthe mountains, I decided to build a week-end bungalow and a laboratory\r\nfor developing my films. A three-foot concrete foundation had to be laid to keep out the damp, and on this foundation the house was built. At last the building was complete, the machinery and apparatus installed, and we\r\nstarted to work. My assistants were Javanese, Malay and vSundanese men. The dark rooms had all been arranged on one side of the building. I told\r\nthe men to develop the films ; and they made a few tests, and showed\r\nthem to me. When I found the tests were good I told them to develop\r\nthe whole film (about 1000 feet). The film was completely ruined after developing. Thinking that the men made some mistakes, although they were quite intelligent, I myself made a few tests which came out well, but\r\nafter developing another 1000 feet the same thing happened again. This\r\nwent on for weeks ; the laboratory was there, but no work could be done.\r\nOne day, on my way back from the mountains to the city, I stopped at a\r\npetrol filling station to get some petrol, where I saw an old acquaintance\r\nof mine whom I knew to be strong in magic power. After we had ex- changed greetings he asked me how I was, as he had not seen me for a long\r\ntime. I told him that I lived more in the mountains than in the city, and\r\ninvited him to come and see me. On the appointed day he came. I must\r\npoint out here that I had told him nothing of the troubles in the laboratory,\r\nand that he was a stranger in this place and never had been there before.\r\nI showed him round the place, and when we came in the vicinity of the\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Psychic Phenomena in Indonesia 83\r\ndark rooms he stopped and looked. Neither of us spoke. When we came\r\ninto my private office we sat down. He looked at me and said, \" There\r\nis something wrong in this building.\" And then I admitted all what\r\nhappened in the last few weeks, and asked him whether he could find out\r\nwhat was wrong. He then asked for a charcoal fire and incense and seven\r\ndifferent kind of flowers. (The number seven seems to have a great\r\nimportance in magic.) He shredded the flowers in his palms, spread his\r\nhands over the fire, and of course murmured some incantations. He then\r\nrevealed that this part of the house where the darkrooms were arranged, was built on graves. I told him that no traces of graves were there when\r\nwe started to build, and if the builders, who were all natives, had noticed\r\nthe graves they would not have proceeded with the work. To cut a long\r\nstory short, we had to break up one corner of the house and the foundation\r\nand after digging down about 5 feet we found skulls and bones which must\r\nhave been there for many years. The sorcerer collected these and buried\r\nthem in another place, which he marked by an oblong stone, so that the\r\nsouls might rest unmolested. Apart from this, offerings had to be made\r\nonce a week on Thursday, for three months. This was done by my\r\nassistants. Once a month at full moon, the sorcerer came to make the\r\nofferings himself. This part of the house has been built up again, and\r\nthere have been no further troubles.\r\nA spirited discussion followed in which Mr Bekker was closely questioned by several members. He gave the following additional information.\r\nThe site on which the laboratory was built was rather sloppy, soft ground, without rocks or stones. There were coconut-trees which grew\r\nin distances of 6 to 10 feet apart. Graves are never placed where coconuttrees grow, because the coconuts are harvested by the natives and the\r\ngraves would be disturbed. According to their heights the coconut-trees were about 50 years old or more, and it would therefore be improbable\r\nthat anybody could guess there were graves there.\r\nThe films which were spoiled I made on my expeditions in Sumatra,\r\nand they dealt with landscapes, ceremonies, dances, and art of the\r\nisland.\r\nAfter two films had been completely ruined I took one part to Kodaks\r\nin Batavia and one part to a Chinese Laboratory in Bandoeng. In both\r\ncases the developing turned out satisfactory.\r\nThis incident took place in 1929, about June or July.\r\nUnaided I made three preliminary tests which were satisfactory, and\r\nafter developing the whole film I found it was ruined.\r\nThe developing tank held 150 litres of liquid. The chemicals were mixed according to the developing formulae, and the entire process had\r\nbeen carried out according to the normal regulations for developing. The\r\ntests had been made in the same tank and in the same liquid.\r\nI do not recall other mishaps in these dark rooms. Apart from developing films nothing else had been done there.\r\nI met the sorcerer who discovered the bones through a friend of mine, a white man, whom the sorcerer once helped. Since that time I have met\r\nhim in Batavia occasionally. He lived in Depok which is near Batavia.\r\n\u00a74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\nI knew him as being of good character and of strong magic power. He\r\nwas about 55 or 60 years old. The petrol filling station was aliout 75 kilometres (46.6 miles) from the\r\nplace where the laboratory was built. The name of the place was\r\nTjitjoeroeg (pronounced Tjitjuruck) between Buitenzorg and Soekaboemi, on the way from Batavia to Bandoeng. Tjitjoeroeg is about 100 kilometres\r\n(62.1 miles) from Batavia. The sorcerer lived in the village Depok which was near the petrol station, i.e. he lived about 77 kilometres (48.7 miles)\r\nfrom the laboratory.\r\nWhen I invited the man to come and visit me, and mentioned the name\r\nof the place Tjitjoeroeg, he did not know where the place was, or how to get there. I had to tell him which train to take, and at which station to get off, and in which direction to walk. I knew the man, and I am sure he would not have pretended that he had never heard of this place if he\r\nhad ever been there.\r\nI told the sorcerer that unless he could prove that there were bones\r\nunder the foundation I would not break up the house. The sorcerer and I, accompanied by one of my servants, whom I ordered to take a shovel and\r\na pick, went to the corner of the laboratory which the sorcerer indicated\r\nto me. Here I told my servant, who had not asked questions, to dig a hole\r\nabout 3 feet square near the concrete. He started to dig. In about\r\nI I hours the hold was some 5 feet deep. The ground was soft, and there were no rocks or roots of any kind. The sorcerer looked intently while my\r\nservant was digging, and suddenly told the servant not to dig further but\r\nonly loosen the earth with a piece of bamboo and remove it with his hands.\r\nAfter a further 15 minutes, I noticed a long greyish piece which looked to me like the fibula and tibia. The servant had not noticed it yet, he worked\r\nonly on the instructions of the sorcerer, and loosened the earth very gently.\r\nA few minutes later the servant noticed the bones of a foot and refused to work further because he was afraid he was doing something wrong.\r\nNeither the sorcerer nor myself could persuade him to dig further. He\r\ngot out from the hole, but I did not allow him to go away but told him to remain with me. The sorcerer himself did the digging. Then he cleared\r\nthe leg and later a hand and arm showed up. The sorcerer told me that\r\nthere were further under the concrete 3 more bodies, making 4\r\naltogether.\r\nI saw the one skeleton, which was just under the place where the\r\ndeveloping tanks stood. This was proof enough for me that this part of\r\nthe building must be broken down.\r\nThe next day, I sent my house-boy to the native builder with a message\r\nto come and see me immediately. When the builder came, I explained to him that a part of the building including the foundation had to be broken\r\ndown, because I wanted to extend the building. Had I revealed to the\r\nbuilder the true reason for the demolition, he would never have started the\r\nwork as he would not have been able to get men to do the work. Later,\r\nwhen we found the skeletons and bones, I told him the true story.\r\nIt may surprise you that there were no cofiins, and I should like to point out here that poor natives are very often buried without a coffin,\r\nwrapped in only a piece of cloth (Saroeng) which they have worn during\r\ntheir lifetime.\r\nI should like to confirm that during the whole digging I stood with my\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Research Officer's Notes 85\r\neyes fixed on the hole and never left for a second. It is impossible that\r\nthe bones had been placed in the hole by someone during the digging,\r\nbecause there were only three of us, the sorcerer, my boy and myself.\r\nWhile the boy was digging the sorcerer and I watched, and when the\r\nsorcerer started to dig, the boy stood next to me, and we two watched.\r\nHad anyone dropped the bones into the hole, I would have seen it, apart\r\nfrom the fact that there were not only single bones but a complete corpse.\r\nRESEARCH OFFICER'S NOTES\r\n\/. The Infra-red Telescope\r\nOne of the many inventions developed during the war is an apparatus\r\nwith which one can \" see in the dark \". There have been several refer- ences to this instrument in the press of recent months. Its use in nighttime manoeuvres, such as tracking criminals, has been enlarged upon,\r\nand many people may have wondered about its application to the seance room. The fact is, there are models of infra-red telescope ideally suited to the\r\ninvestigation of physical phenomena. There has to be a source of infrared radiation in the room, but this can readily be adjusted to give off no\r\nvisible light whatever. An optical device quite similar to an ordinary\r\ntelescope picks up and focusses the infra-red light reflected from objects\r\nand people in the room. The instrument forms an image on a fluorescent\r\nscreen. With a good source of light, every detail of a completely dark\r\nroom can be made as visible as if it were flooded with bright sunlight.\r\nLooking through the instrument one can read the time by the wrist watch\r\nof a person three yards away.\r\nThe significance of this infra-red telescope for psychical investigation can hardly be over-estimated. Physical mediums may sit in inky blackness, but in spite of that handicap their phenomena can be watched and\r\nstudied almost as easily as if they were taking place in broad daylight.\r\nTo the genuine medium this will be a welcome innovation. The disagreeable methods of manual control, the switching on and off of red lights,\r\nthe constant suspicion of something underhanded going on in the dark,\r\nin fact all the unpleasantness and discomfort of the old-fashioned seance can be avoided by the judicious application of this new instrument. The\r\ngenuine medium has everything to gain and nothing to lose by sitting\r\nwith this instrument, and we may look forward with confidence to a much\r\nclearer understanding of physical phenomena in the near future. For\r\nthe fraudulent medium on the other hand, the telescope will be very\r\ndisturbing.\r\nI am pleased to say that the Society is being very kindly lent one of these\r\n86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july i 947\r\ninfra-red telescopes for use in its seance room. Members who are in touch with physical mediums will be able to invite them to come to the\r\nSociety for this new and pleasant form of investigation. There have\r\nalways been some people who, rightly or wrongly, maintain that the\r\nsuspicious and critical attitude of the usual scientific investigator either\r\ninhibits genuine phenomena, or else encourages fraud. With the facilities which will soon be available at the Society, these people will be able to investigate on their own and literally \" see it for themselves \".\r\nIt would of course be possible to use an infra-red telescope without the\r\nmedium being aware of its presence, but such a policy is unnecessary.\r\nNo genuine medium can have any reason to fear the new device. Only\r\nthe fraudulent medium will be put oft, and after all we do not want to waste time with frauds.\r\n\/\/. Offer to Genuine Physical Mediums\r\nSome interested psychical investigators, who wish to remain anonymous,\r\nbut who are known to the Hon. Editor, make the following announcement\r\nto mediums who can produce genuine objective physical phenomena.\r\n\" ;^25o will be given to the first medium who, in response to this notice,\r\ngives sittings in the seance room of the Society for Psychical Research,\r\nand can there produce supernormal physical phenomena which the\r\nSociety's Research Officer can prove to his satisfaction are genuine. This\r\noffer will remain open until Dec. 31st 1947.\"\r\nIt must be made clear that the Council of the Society for Psychical\r\nResearch are not responsible for this offer. While they welcome the\r\nopportunity it gives for investigation, and are willing that the seance room\r\nshould be used, and that their Research Officer should act as arbiter of the\r\ngenuineness of the phenomena, the decision of the Research Officer must\r\nbe regarded as his own personal view. The Society's policy is to express no corporate opinion, and whatever the outcome of the proposed investigation it must not be taken as committing the Council as to the genuineness\r\nor otherwise of any particular medium or mediums.\r\n\/\/\/. Maurice Fogel\r\nSeveral members of the Society have asked me about the stage performer,\r\nMr Maurice Fogel, who claims remarkable telepathic powers. Articles\r\nhave appeared in the press (The Sunday Pictorial, 20 April 1947 ; Everybodys\\ 24 May 1947) describing a telepathy experiment which took place\r\nat the West Cliff Theatre, Clacton-on-Sea on 17 April 1947. According\r\nto the newspaper account, the well-known American experimenter Dr J. B. Rhine was rung up at Duke University by trans-Atlantic telephone. He\r\nwas asked to think of one item from a list of forty simple objects that had\r\nbeen sent to him. Dr Rhine did so, and without knowing his choice, Mr\r\nFogel drew a picture of the right object, which was a boat.\r\nThis was regarded as a great success, and has been written up as an\r\ninstance of genuine telepathic communication. As Dr Rhine's name has\r\nbeen used freely, I think it is only fair that readers of the Journal should\r\nknow his true opinion of the matter. In a letter dated 24 May 1947 he\r\nwrites : . . <\r\nJUNE-JULY 1947 Implications of Psychical Research - 87\r\n\" I suggested the conditions for the transatlantic experiment, but\r\n[Mr Fogel] was very insistent that he wanted to try his own idea. Since\r\nhe was going to pay for the telephone message, and since only a few\r\nminutes of my time would be involved, and especially since he insisted\r\nin his letter that there would be no publicity zvhatever, I decided to let him\r\ngo ahead. . . . \" Under these conditions the test could mean nothing, and I was not\r\nin any way interested in it. For example, he insisted upon knowing which\r\nof his eighteen drawings (which he had sent to us in advance) the sender\r\nhere was looking at, and he refused to tell over the telephone what his\r\nresponse was.\r\n\" The reporters came to see me within an hour of the test ... I naturally\r\ngave them the truth about the situation, and I hope something of this side\r\nof the case came out in the paper over there, if only to keep the good name\r\nof parapsychology from getting mixed up with showmen.\"\r\nMr Fogel gave a demonstration of what he claimed was telepathy at the\r\n500th dinner of the Ghost Club. The performance obviously consisted\r\nof well-known conjuring tricks, and not of genuine telepathy. At the\r\nnext meeting of the Ghost Club, Mr Harry Price, the Chairman, an- nounced that he knew Fogel's performance had been pure conjuring.\r\nIMPLICATIONS OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\r\nFour talks on the implications of psychical research were given on the\r\nB.B.C. Third Programme in April and May. The first, a recording of a previous broadcast by Professor H. H. Price, dealt with the philosophical\r\nimplications of telepathy. Taking telepathy as a proved fact. Professor\r\nPrice drew attention to a number of questions that fact raises as to the\r\nnature of the human mind and its connection with other minds. The\r\nsecond talk, by Professor Broad, discussed the philosophical implications\r\nof precognition. Dr Thouless, the third speaker, tackled the relation of\r\npsychical research to scientific psychology, showing the inadequacy of the\r\npresent relation and looking forward towards a better understanding of the\r\nfindings of psychical research and a time when they will find their place\r\nin a new and more inclusive scientific theory. Finally, Mr Tyrrell, after summarising some of the conclusions of the previous speakers, drew\r\nattention to the experience of poets and other artists, who seem able to draw inspiration from the subliminal self beyond the level of normal\r\nconsciousness. The texts of these talks have been printed in the Listener.\r\n88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june-july 1947\r\nBOOK NOTICE\r\nThe Personality of Man. By G. N. M. Tyrrell.

Grahame Howe spoke on \" Beyond\r\nPsychology \". The 195th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library on\r\nThursday, 3 July 1947, when a paper on \" Experimental Extra-Sensory\r\nPerception \" was read by Mr D. A. H. Parsons.\r\nP. 309 THREE APPARENTLY PRECOGNITIVE DREAMS\r\nThe following accounts of three apparently precognitive dreams are contributed by Mrs C, a member of the Society. The first was written on\r\nJune 4th, 1947. \" My husband is a doctor and last Friday night or during the early hours\r\nof Saturday morning I had a curious dream. In my dream the night bell rang urgently several times. Still in my dream I got out of bed and looked\r\ndown into the street, where I saw drawn up a large cream ambulance.\r\nBehind it were two cars and two men standing on the pavement, and,\r\nlooking up at me, trying apparently to give me a message, was a very sadfaced woman in white. Presently she shook her head sadly and the whole\r\nscene vanished. I told this story to my husband in the morning and to a friend in the afternoon. When I returned in the late evening I found that\r\nmy husband had been called suddenly to see another doctor's patient, who\r\nhad suddenly been taken ill. He came home to 'phone for an ambulance.\r\nShortly afterwards he was called back to the patient, found her dead, the\r\nambulance at the door\u2014which as the woman was dead drove off without\r\nher\u2014and her own doctor with his car. \" The night before last I had another dream. This time I saw a man fall in the street. I was asked by passers-by to help, but I felt a great reluctance. I was asked also to fetch my husband and I felt again a great reluctance to do so. This dream I also told my husband and the same friend\r\nand my daughter of 17. Last night about 1 1 p.m. when I was in bed, nearly\r\nasleep, and my husband was having a bath, I heard footsteps come to the\r\ndoor and the day bell rang. I thought sleepily, ' Bother them, why do\r\nthey come so late ' (my husband very rarely has night calls or callers).\r\nThe night bell then rang twice and very reluctantly I got out of bed and\r\nwent to the speaking-tube. A man's voice told me that his friend, a man,\r\nhad fainted and hurt himself and would my husband come down and stitch\r\nhim up. I felt averse to calling my husband but did so, and when I got\r\ninto bed I remembered my dream. I have never had these kind of dreams\r\nbefore and I think it is a year since my husband was called out to an\r\naccident or sudden death. If you think this of interest I can get the signatures of the people to whom I told the dreams before they came true. \" I can only explain my reluctance to answer the bell or call my husband\r\nby the fact that we had both had a very busy dav and were very tired. \" Signed (Mrs C.).\"\r\nOn 9 June Mrs C. sent the following account of what she classifies as a dream, which caused her to back the Derby winner, despite the fact that\r\n92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept. 1947\r\nthe experts and her friends said that it had no hope of winning, as well as further information about her previous dreams, which had been asked for\r\nby the Research Ofhcer. She wrote :\r\n\" 1 took to bed and placed under my pillow last Tuesday night, the 3rd\r\nof June, a list of the probable Derby runners. About 3 a.m. I awoke to hear the words ' The Turtle ' repeated three times. I put on the light and\r\nlooked at the list of horses and when I came to Pearl Diver I felt that was\r\nthe horse. I looked at all the names of owners, trainers and jockeys but\r\nfound nothing like turtle. I have been abroad and have seen turtles leave\r\ntheir eggs and dive into the sea and I felt here was a possible connection.\r\nThe next morning at breakfast I picked up a magazine which had arrived\r\nwith the morning papers, Illustrated by name, and opened it at a page\r\nshowing Gordon Richards on ' Tudor Minstrel ' with the caption\r\n' Favourites do not always win the Derby '. I turned back a page and there\r\nWas a picture, covering both pages, of turtles and their eggs and young.\r\nThat decided me and I rang up a firm of bookmakers just to prove my\r\nconviction that I had picked the winner. I was not able to persuade more\r\nthan one other person to share this conviction.\r\n\" Regarding your questions. I have been a sleepwalker and a dreamer\r\nof vivid dreams since I was small, but I do not recall any dream of a precognitive character. In fact I have rarely remembered my dreams clearly on waking, but lately I have been making a determined effort to do so. By\r\n' these kind of dreams ' I mean dreams which had anything to do with\r\naccidents or illness, although my husband is a doctor. The name of the\r\npatient who died was Smith. ... I am not aware of any notice appearing\r\nin the paper (there was not an inquest) although there may have been. In\r\nany case this could not have appeared until the Tuesday following, as the\r\ndeath occurred on Saturday night. The man who was hurt was not told of\r\nthe dream. He, like the other patient, was unknown to both of us. I may\r\nsay, incidentally, that my husband is most sceptical and would be the last person to agree that I could dream precognitive dreams until he had\r\nevidence which was unshakeable. He even backed another horse because\r\nhe thought my conviction that Pearl Diver would win was nonsense. I have the bookmaker's account dated 4th June, 1947.\" Signed (Mrs. C).\r\nMrs C's husband sent detailed confirmation of all her statements. The\r\nfriend mentioned. Lady M , wrote : \" I confirm the fact that Mrs\r\nC. told me of the three aforementioned dreams before the events\r\nactually took place.\" Mrs C's daughter wrote : \" I was present on the\r\nmorning of the 3rd June when my mother told Lady Mitchelson of her\r\ndream of the previous night in regard to the man falling, and of her reluctance to help or obtain help. I was having breakfast with my mother\r\nwhen she opened the paper. Illustrated, and heard her exclaim. She told\r\nme of her dream and the connection with the pictures in the paper. This was Wednesday, 4th June.\"\r\nIn answer to a further enquiry Dr C. stated that he had no knowledge of\r\nany previous precognitive dreams by his wife and that he was certain that\r\nhis wife had not previously told him of dreams which had not come true.\r\nSEPT. 1947 Sotne Unusual \" Psychic Phenomena \" 93\r\nA RECENT INVESTIGATION OF SOME UNUSUAL\r\n\" PSYCHIC PHENOMENA \"\r\nThe following account is written in an informal and chatty manner,\r\nbefitting the bizarre nature of the facts to be reported.\r\nEarly last year (1946) I received a letter from a Mr G. A. Emberg, of\r\nVancouver, B.C., telling me of certain psychic experiences of his own,\r\nand asking to be investigated by our American Psychical Institute, of\r\nwhich I am the Director. Mr Emberg was evidently quite sincere, and\r\noffered to pay his own expenses to and from Hollywood, and give any\r\nnumber of sittings gratis. He asked only that his living expenses be paid\r\nwhile here.\r\nMr Emberg stated that he was able to diminish and increase the amount\r\nof light emitted by an ordinary electric light bulb merely by reason of his\r\nown bodily proximity ; and further that he could cause the bulb to become\r\nfilled with beautiful iridescent colours, which varied and floated about,\r\ncloud-like, within it. We could supply our own bulbs, which he did not\r\nwant to touch or handle in any way, and supervise the whole experiment.\r\nTwo types of bulbs were to be used : a 60-watt and a 150-watt ; his only\r\nstipulation being that all bulbs used should be frosted. All this seemed fair enough, and the offer was accepted with thanks.\r\nA number of group sittings were accordingly held, averaging on each\r\noccasion about eight observers. The bulbs were new, purchased by us\r\nthe preceding day. They were screwed into the socket and unscrewed by\r\nmy assistant. Mr Emberg himself did not touch them, but stood at a distance of about three or four feet, rubbing his hands or holding them\r\ntogether. The light itself, of course, fully illuminated the room. The\r\nsmaller bulb was tried first, then the larger one. The results in both cases were very similar, though considerably more striking in the case of the\r\nlarger bulb.\r\nMr Emberg stated first of all that he would dim the light. Some of the\r\nobservers said that they seemed to note a slight diminution in its brilliance ; others that they failed to observe any difference. The general impression was that this was entirely psychological, rather than objective\u2014and later experiments, where a light-meter was employed, confirmed this. . . . The\r\nsitters were then asked to look directly at the bulb without letting their\r\ngaze wander. We did so and, lo and behold! every one of us did see beautiful,\r\niridescent colours shifting and moving about within the bulb. These\r\nwere for the most part pastel shades\u2014blue, green, pink, mauve, etc. We\r\ndescribed these in turn and found that, while this was the case, we saw\r\ndifferent colours in diff'erent parts of the bulb\u2014our impressions did not\r\ntally! The net result of the sitting was to convince us that the phenomenon\r\nwas purely optical, and that no objective colours existed within the bulb\r\nitself. It remained for us to prove this. Further sittings were therefore held, in conjunction with Mr DeWitt\r\nMiller and several friends of his\u2014experts in colour photography. Twentyseven colour photographs were taken, under a variety of conditions, when\r\ncolours were being seen in the bulb by several witnesses. All of these\r\nproved entirely negative : no colours witliin the bulb were registered on\r\n94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept. 1947\r\nany occasion. The purely optical and subjective nature of the observed\r\nphenomena was therefore proved quite conclusively.\r\nMr Emberg had contended from the first that these results could only\r\nbe obtained in his presence. However, experiments in gazing at the bulb\r\nin his absence produced precisely similar results. They were, evidently,\r\nentirely optical.\r\nAnyone who cares to experiment for himself, with frosted bulbs, can\r\ndoubtless obtain the same results. What struck us more than anything\r\nelse, as the result of our experiments, was that we were all so \" dumb\"\r\nthat we had never thought of trying this ourselves beforehand, in order to see what we could observe! We can only plead, by way of excuse, the\r\nnovelty of the experiments and the fact that we had not been fully informed\r\nas to the nature of the \" phenomena \" which we should be called upon to observe. Any of our members can try the experiment, however, and\r\ndoubtless they too will be surprised at the results.\r\n. Hereward Carrington\r\n^ THE APPEAL TO PHYSICAL MEDIUMS\r\nA previous number of the Journal contained a notice of an offer of ^^250\r\nfor a genuine demonstration of physical mediumship given under certain\r\ntest conditions and suliject to the findings of the Research Officer. This\r\noffer was published in Lig\/ii, Prediction and Psychic Truth. Representatives of several societies and institutions which are in touch with mediums\r\nwere also notified, and personal approaches were made to twelve prominent\r\nphysical m.ediuniG directly. Unfortunately, only one medium, Mr Frank\r\nAllen, accepted the invitation to give a demonstration. The Research\r\nOfficer was present at a sitting organised by the Kilburn Society of\r\nPhysical Phenomena at Mr E. Davies' house, on 19 May 1947. At this\r\nsitting, during periods of darkness, apports of flowers were obtained.\r\nMr Allen came to the S.P.R. rooms for a test sitting on 28 May. On this occasion no apports were obtained. An offer of a further sitting was not\r\ntaken up.\r\nThis lack of response is disappointing. Now that the infra-red telescope\r\nis available, and crucial tests are possible without discomfort, it is hoped\r\nthat members who are in touch with physical mediums will encourage\r\nthem to come forward for a demonstration.\r\n:\r\n' OBITUARY\r\nDr Max Dessoir. We regret to have to record the death, last July, of\r\nDr Max Dessoir, the distinguished German psychologist. As far back as 1885, when he vvas eighteen years old, Dessoir was experimenting in\r\nMuscle-reading and Thought-transference, and in the same year he\r\nsubmitted a report on this work to Proceedings (Vol. IV), a supplementary\r\nreport being printed in Vol. V. Soon after this he collaborated with\r\nMoll in experiments in hypnotic rapport. His name appears in the list of Corresponding Mimliers from 1890 onwards. He knew Gurney,\r\nSEPT. 1947 Correspondence 95\r\nMyers and the Sidgwicks well. In 1946 he publislied a book of reminiscences, which was reviewed in the Journal for October-November of that\r\nyear, and a further work. Das Ich, der Traum, der Tod, has just appeared.\r\nDr C. E Stuart. We learn with great regret of the death, on March 23\r\n1947, of Dr C. E. Stuart, the well-known American experimenter.\r\nDr Stuart's interest in psychical research began when he was an undergraduate at Duke University, and his association with the Department of\r\nParapsychology there continued until his death.\r\nWith his passing, we have lost a careful and original experimenter.\r\nWhile he used the card techniques to the full, he will be remembered best\r\nfor his work with drawings. Dr Stuart believed that E.S.P. faculty was\r\nessentially individualistic and that by using \" free material \", in place of\r\nthe hit-or-miss card guesses, personal idiosyncrasies of distortion could be\r\nbetter studied. At the same time, his mathematical turn of mind enabled\r\nhim to devise appropriate statistical methods to deal with the material.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE '\r\nTo the Editor of the Journal.\r\nSir,\u2014Mr J. S. Spence's case of apparent retrocognition, reported in the\r\nlast issue of the Journal, realises a long hoped-for condition. He had a camera and used it at the right moment. The result, shown in the upper\r\nphotograph in Plate 11, proves that his experience had no physical basis. While he saw the wall stretching for some distance over grass, brambles\r\nand bracken to the edge of the cliff, the camera took a photograph of the\r\nclitT extending sheer down from his feet to the beach below. This provides\r\nanother piece of evidence that sensory hallucinations can be as complete\r\nand perfect as normal sense-perception, even to the extent that one can push one's way through hallucinatory bracken and brambles without\r\nhaving any idea that they are not material.\r\nThat a subjectively created environment can be complete is shown by\r\nmuch other evidence. Mrs Curran, of the Patience Worth scripts, described\r\nhow she saw the street-scenes of her stories, smelt the smells, and walked\r\nup to the market-stalls, with every sense of being surrounded by reality.\r\nSimilarly, Mrs. Willett described a subjective scene in which she said that\r\nthe persons she met seemed more real to her than those she knew in ordinary life. In mediumistic trance, the communicator is often represented as holding up the object which is being talked about so that the control can\r\nsee it, obviously creating on the spot a sensory image of the object. And\r\nin the out-of-the-body cases, in which the narrator has nearly died but has\r\nrecovered, he usually seems to have been surrounded by a vividly real environment, which generally behaves in a fluctuating fashion.\r\nGhosts and apparitions (which sometimes include surroundings) are evidently due to a similar cause ; but in these new features begin to appear.\r\nThe imagery interpenetrates normal sense-perception and the state of the\r\npercipient is very close to normal consciousness. This is also characteristic of the present case, of the Boscastle guest-house case, of the MoberlyJourdain case at Versailles and of some others. Such cases are rare :\r\n96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept. 1947\r\nprobably nature has seen to it that they should be, otherwise the danger\r\nwould be extreme, liven as it was, Mr Spenee nearly lost his life. It seems that some people tend to class these latter cases separately and\r\nto think that the percipient has been somehow projected into a physical scene in the past or the future. But when the potential thoroughness of\r\nwhat we call (for want of a better term) \" sensory hallucination \" is realised,\r\nit will be seen that there is no need to split up the evidence. The efficient cause of them all is the psychological machinery which creates hallucinations. The final causes are various and can be normal as well as paranormal. By establishing the astonishing completeness of these sensory\r\nconstructs, psychical research has done a most important piece of work.\r\nWere it not that tlie case occurred too long ago for Mr Spence to feel sure now of remembering the details, one would like to ask him some\r\nfurther questions. When he was walking on the headland and seeing\r\nretrocognitively, the wall and other details of the scene kept in their right\r\nplaces in relation to the physical position of his body. But when he seemed\r\nto be entering the cave, and, presumably, when he seemed to be climbing\r\nthe cliff-path on Tuesday, where was his body ? It cannot then have been\r\nproperly related to what he was seeing, because the tide was up and he\r\ncould not have got to the cave, and the cliff-path did not exist.\r\nIt would be interesting to know from someone staying at Brixham or the\r\nneighbourhood whether there are any legends about Crabrock Point, where\r\nthe incident evidently took place.\r\nYours faithfully;\r\nG. N. M. Tyrrell\r\nSir,\u2014The prediction made in my letter in the March Journal, that I should be suspected of an attempt to lower the standards of the S.P.R.,\r\nhas, alas, come true, for in your May number no less than twelve wellknown researchers sign a letter seeking to avert this calamity. But I do not\r\nquite understand their comments on my questions.\r\nMy letter was based on two assumptions : that we were studying the\r\nlight thrown on the nature of the human being by psychic phenomena,\r\nand that the existence of E.S.P. was accepted by all who had dispassionately\r\nstudied the evidence provided by the combination of experimental cases and spontaneous cases taken as a whole, even if they themselves had had no personal experience of the faculty. My enquiry, therefore, was whether\r\nthe time had come to consider the possibility of a systematic study of the\r\npsychological processes involved, as well as (I fear I too easily assumed\r\nthat I should not be credited with suggesting instead of) collecting as much\r\nmore corroborated evidence as possible of so elusive a phenomenon.\r\nOn these assumptions, for example, the comparison of veridical and\r\nnon-veridical hallucinations (if any particular hallucination can be proved\r\nnon-veridical) would be instructive : so would such a case as Mr Spence's\r\ngeographical hallucination in the June Journal. The remarkable feat of\r\nseparating the psychic from the psychological would not be necessary, and\r\nthe Society would increase the respect it had gained by its industrious col- lection of facts, by going on to study their implications.\r\nBut, if I understand aright, my commentators' words, \" many members\r\nof the Society are convinced that E.S.P. is proved,\" imply that many\r\nSEPT. 1947 Correspondence 97\r\nothers are not so convinced, themselves presumably amongst them. Then\r\nmy assumption was mistaken ; I was proposing to run before we can walk ; we are still seeking for evidence of unproven facts. Yet, if the large\r\nquantity of evidence we have is not good enough, it would seem a Sisyphean\r\nlabour to collect more and more of the same kind. Would it be possible\r\nfor my commentators to help us break out of this vicious circle, by suggesting exactly how much of what evidence would, in their eyes, eliminate\r\nchance coincidence and our other bogies, and also by listing those cases (if\r\nany) in our records for which they do not consider possible an explanation,\r\nother than chance coincidence, for E.S.P. We could then at least visualise our goal and estimate what progress (if any) we had made towards it. May I add a final apology. Assuming E.S.P. to be an established fact in the eyes of serious students, I had tentatively enquired whether we were\r\nin sight of the point where we could consider the character and intelligence\r\nof the percipient as a factor in estimating the value of a case : whether, for\r\ninstance, we might make the same allowance for unconscious exaggeration,\r\npathological hallucination, faulty memory and hoaxing, were the Archbishop of Canterbury to report that he had seen a ghost in his Cathedral,\r\nas we would for his unsupported statement that he had seen a kangaroo.\r\nThis apparently conveyed my willingness to accept as evidence cases found in \" plenty of spiritualist journals \". \" Plenty \" must, I fear, include\r\nthe more popular among them. I hasten to say that such was not my\r\nintention and that I regret having expressed myself so ill. Yours faithfully,\r\nRosalind Heywood\r\nSir,\u2014In the last part of the Proceedings (Vol. XLVIII, pp. 121-163), the\r\nRev. C. Drayton Thomas outlined a new hypothesis for trance communication. It is impossible to deal with all the aspects of the problem he\r\nadvances, the quality of the evidence and the independent existence of the\r\ndirect voice are too complex subjects to be discussed here. It is worth\r\nnoting, that the words of the \" communicators \", assumed to be the\r\nthoughts of people immersed in philosophical ideas, and distorted in\r\ntransmission by the medium, are referred to in the conclusion as facts. The hypothesis, set out on pages 122-123, is on the most superficial analysis,\r\ndivisible into seven major assumptions most of which have little or no clear\r\nevidence to support them. In comparison with these, the additional\r\nhypothesis that the communicators arrive in body and stand 2-3 feet from\r\nthe medium is but an added straw to the burden.\r\nIt is the description of the 'psychic power', however, that needs clarifica- tion. My reading of the paper assumes that the term psychic power is used\r\nsynonymously with emanation. It is given certain physical characteristics,\r\nviz. :\r\n1. It has a definite limit (p. 127) and fluctuates like wind on a windy\r\nday (p. 128).\r\n2. It is moved by draught (p. 129).\r\n3. It can transmit vibrations to Feda which is more easily done in a dry\r\natmosphere (p. 129).\r\n4. Vibrations in the emanation set up vibrations in the air, i.e. sound\r\nwaves (p. 123).\r\n98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept. 1947\r\nThe emanation is also endowed with some not so definite properties.\r\n5. It charges the atmosphere (p. 127).\r\n6. It is the etheric part of the physical body, the ether separating the\r\natoms (p. 130).\r\n7. The etheric body lies within the aura, the power lies within both\r\n(p. 130).\r\nThe author has written a paper in which he has discussed the relationship between the physical world and the \" spirits \". In normal scientific communion, it is customary to use nouns and adjectives in a defined sense known to all. Looked at in that light much of the description becomes\r\nvalueless, even confusing, e.g.^, 6, 7, above. Such words as \" charge \" or\r\n\" vibrations \" mean nothing, I repeat, nothing, unless they are further\r\nqualified.\r\nThe Society, rightly or wrongly, is at the moment concentrating its energies on investigating the border line between the proven and the unproven. Any work that clears the rubble from that line is an advance of\r\nknowledge, any article that blurs it with a mist of meaningless words and\r\nphrases is, I submit, out of place in the Proceedings of our Society.\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nI. P. Williams\r\nREVIEWS\r\nThe Personality of Man. G. N. M. Tyrrell. \" Pelican \" Series. 295 pp.\r\nIS. Nine years ago Mr Tyrrell laid all psychical researchers under a heavy\r\ndebt of gratitude by producing in his Science and Psychical Phenomena\r\nmuch the best survey of their subject that had appeared for a generation.\r\nHe has now repeated his success, with a book on a smaller scale, but for\r\nthat reason more likely to reach a public sadly needing enlightenment as to what psychical research is, and still more, what it is not. In the intervening years much has happened to make desirable, even\r\nurgently necessary, a restatement of the problem of human personality,\r\nwhat it is as a whole, and what it might be. On a proper understanding of\r\nthis rest all hopes of building a world order, and of avoiding yet more\r\n\" wars to end war \". Science and philosophy have both, in Mr Tyrrell's\r\nview, become so specialised as to be unable to grasp the problem as a whole, and he criticises both for leaving out of account ascertained facts of the highest relevance. To the sum total of these facts notable additions\r\nhave been made during the last decade.\r\nWhere are such facts to be found ? Mr Tyrrell deals first with \" the\r\nhigher reaches of personality \" as illustrated by what the poets, musicians\r\nand scientific discoverers have put on record concerning the process of\r\ninspiration, and by the testimony of the mystics of all ages, lands and\r\ncreeds. These two chapters should be compared with the final section of\r\nanother recent \" Pelican \", V. H. Moltram's TJie Physical Basis of Personality, as both books, starting from very different points of view, reach\r\nmuch the same conclusion as to the validity and significance of mystical\r\nexperiences.\r\nSEPT. 1947 Reviews 99\r\nMr Tyrrell then passes to psychical research proper, beginning with a\r\nbrief historical account, followed by a definition of some of the more\r\nimportant terms. It is hard for a psychical researcher to achieve an equal\r\nunderstanding of all the manifold branches of his subject, but Mr Tyrrell\r\nshows an admirable impartiality in his treatment of mental and physical,\r\nspontaneous, mediumistic and experimental phenomena, and of qualitative\r\nand quantitative methods of research.\r\nHe begins his exposition with some instances of telepathy and foreknowledge, and a discussion of their implications. Then follow six chapters (10-15) \u00b0\" \" Psychical Research in the Laboratory \", in which,\r\nafter a brief mention of early experiments, often nowadays unduly\r\nneglected, in telepathy and clairvoyance, the more recent researches of\r\nRhine, Carrington, Soal and Hettinger are in turn lucidly epitomised. The\r\nchapters on cross-correspondences, Mrs Willett and Control-mediumship,\r\nand those on poltergeists and the physical phenomena of the seance-room,\r\ndeal as satisfactorily as the scale of the book permits with matters that call for detailed treatment.\r\nAdmirable as is the atmosphere of philosophic calm in which Mr\r\nTyrrell sets out one after another the principal branches of psychical re- search with comment appropriate to each, still more welcome, to the\r\npresent reviewer at least, is the raising of the controversial temperature\r\nperceptible in the chapter (26) headed \" Attitude to Psychical Research\r\nAre Men of Science Impersonal about Facts ? \" In this and in the two\r\nfollowing chapters a rich assortment of professors are pilloried as they\r\ndeserve. Not all professors of course, but such as are unable to balance a proper belief in the order of the universe, by a willingness, without which\r\nsuch a belief cannot be justified, to accept \" brute facts \", including facts such as telepathy and precognition, \" which at first sight appear to be unattached and unassimilable.\" No better illustration could be found of the\r\ncurious dilemma into which the neglect of psychical research has landed\r\nmany scientists than Mottram's admirable book, already mentioned, in\r\nwhich all the objective facts cited, those of Mendelism, endocrinology, etc. point to a materialist and determinist conclusion, in opposition to which\r\nthe author bravely arrays the subjective experiences of mysticism, without\r\nany hint that there are other objective facts, those of psychical research,\r\nwhich suggest that such a head-on collision is quite unnecessary.\r\nThe chapter (29) entitled \" The Significance of the Whole \" is a vindication of psychical research and its methods with which the reviewer is in\r\nsuch entire agreement that he would like to quote it in full. It is better\r\nhowever that members should read it in its proper place towards the end\r\nof a close-knit exposition, factual and commentative, of the whole subject.\r\nIn the last chapter, \" Psychical Research and Religion,\" Mr Tyrrell,\r\nafter re-stating the difference between psychical research and spiritualism,\r\ndeals with the argument put forward by Dr Inge and others that \" The\r\nkind of immortality which psychical research endeavours (sic) to establish\r\nwould be for him \\i.e. the Platonist, with whom Dr Inge evidently sympathises] the negation of the only immortality which he desires or believes\r\nin \". Why, as Mr Tyrrell pertinently asks, \" negation,\" unless Dr Inge\r\nis infected with \" the philosophy of natural-supernatural dualism \" } The idea of an in4efinite continuance of finite existence is distasteful to\r\nlOO Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept, i 947\r\nmany who appreciate the force of the evidence which psychical research\r\nprovides for survival in some form. The conception of telepathy now\r\nprevalent seems to open the door to the idea of progressively depersonalised survival, and perhaps the gradual \" fading out \" of good\r\n\" communications \" from communicators who have been some time dead \u2014a fact often noted\u2014is a definite piece of evidence, however small, in\r\nsupport of that idea.\r\nW. H. S.\r\nChallenge of the Unknown. Louis K. Anspacher. Current Books, Inc. (New York, 1947). 327 pp. 8 3.75.\r\nDr Anspacher, who is well known in the United States as a lecturer,\r\nstudied philosophy at Columbia University under J. H. Hyslop. In this\r\nway he became initiated into psychical research, which has remained for\r\nhim a life-long interest. He describes his book as \" designed to be a sort of philosophical discussion of the entire domain of psychics \", adding,\r\n\" iVIy aim was not in any sense conclusive. Quite the contrary : my purpose was to be provocative and orientative.\" He is to be warmly congratulated on his success. The lively informality of his style enables him\r\nto convey to the reader with the minimum of difficulty a large mass of fact and reasoned argument.\r\nIn a book covering so wide a field and with so many merits it may seem\r\nungracious to point out a few omissions and errors. Dr Anspacher is so generous in his references to psychical research in this country that it comes as a surprise to find no mention of the Leonard or Willett phenomena, or of the experiments of Dr Soal. Even more curious is it for an American book to ignore W. F. Prince, and, I think, all the recent work of\r\nthe American S.P.R. As to errors, Henry Sidgwick is twice credited with\r\nthe part-authorship of Phantasms of the Living, and is described as of\r\nOxford. In compensation F. C. S. Schiller is given to Cambridge. Geley\r\nis sometimes called Gelet, and appears in the index under both names.

London : Rider, 1947.\r\nIn this interesting work, Dr Thompson gives an account of innumerable\r\nmagical proceedures which have been used through the ages for curing the\r\nsick. They range from spells and incantations, ceremonial rites and\r\nhealing emblems, to the faith cures which can. be witnessed today.\r\nWhile healing methods are as changeable as fashions in clothes, the\r\nbelief that the course of illness is subject to magical influences of one sort or another is pretty universal. This book is written from the point of view\r\nof one more concerned with the historical developments of the belief, than\r\nin how much factual basis there may be. Few would deny that will-power,\r\nfaith, hope and other intangible forces enter into the preservation of health\r\nand the curing of disease, but how these factors operate has yet to be\r\ninvestigated.\r\nD.

Rawcliffe, a member of the Society, for\r\ndrawing attention to an interesting prediction reported in the Revue Inter- nationale de Radiesthesie, (No. 4. Deuxieme Trimestre, 1947).\r\nThe writer of the report, M. Jean Charloteaux, has published a book on\r\nradiesthesia : the art of divination by pendulums and similar methods.\r\nThe account given heiow is a slightly abridged translation of M. Charloteaux' report.]\r\nWe start our story in February, 1941. Since June, 1940, w e had been in\r\nBavaria, huddled behind barbed wire in a P.O.W. camp. To celebrate my\r\nbirthday, on February i ith, my friends presented me with a Swede turnip.\r\nIn return, they suggested that I should predict the date of the end of the\r\nwar. Since they refused to accept my protests and excuses, I got going.\r\n104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1947\r\nI drew a little sketch which Lemaire, an architect in civil life, transferred\r\nto cardboard in Chinese ink. It was a design of concentric circles. The\r\ntwo (outer) circles, of greatest diameter, were divided into 31 compartments, numbered i to 31. Between the second and third circles the 12\r\nmonths of the year were written down. Finally, between the third and\r\nfourth circles were written the years 1940 to 1947.\r\nI started the pendulum gyrating at the centre of the dial. After some\r\nseconds the movements changed to oscillations along the axis 1945-41.\r\nHeld above 1941 the pendulum stopped dead ; but over 1945 it moved\r\nvigorously.\r\n\" Gentlemen, the war will end in 1945!\r\n\" We found the month by the same process. The oscillation indicated\r\nMay-November, the movement gave May. For the day, the choice lay\r\nbetween the 8th and the 24th. The 8th was finally fixed. \" The war will end on May 8th, 1945.\"\r\nEveryone shouted. But a wise man, Commandant Mommens, said he was going to write it down for future verification. I often repeated this\r\nexperiment when my friends asked me, especially on occasions when a military or diplomatic event looked like altering the prediction of the pendulum ; but it never varied. On May 7th 1945, the radio announced that\r\nGermany had surrendered. My friends rushed into my room to congratulate me, saying I was only a day out. Next day the radio announced that\r\nthe official date fixed for the termination of hostilities was May 8th.\r\nThe officers who had taken note of my trials during the years 1941-45,\r\nkindly signed an attestation, giving their names, rank, addresses and the\r\ndate on which the prediction was m.ade known to them.\r\n[Note. The report was followed by a list of names and addresses of 27\r\nBelgian officers, with facsimiles of their signatures. They certified that\r\nthey had all at various times heard of M. Charloteaux' prediction before\r\nits fulfilment. The Research Officer wrote to 13 of the signatories, select- ing those stated to have known of the prediction before 1944. Nine replies\r\n^- were received. Translations of these replies are given below.]\r\n1. Captain Egon : In reply to your letter of Aug. 25, 1947, I wish to state that I signed, some time in 1943, a declaration testifying that, at that date, Lt. Charloteaux had fixed the date for the end of the war. I was a P.O.W. at Prenzlau\r\ncamp, near Berlin. Lt. Charloteaux, an authority on radiesthesia, had the\r\ndeclaration mentioned in the Revue de Radiesthesie signed by some friends.\r\nI cannot recall the exact date fixed, but it would be embodied in the declaration.\r\nM. Charloteaux is the author of a popular book on radiesthesia which I have read with much interest. I confess that I was exceedingly sceptical\r\nabout his statements, but I realise that on this occasion events have served\r\nhim so well that he may be forgiven for some failures on other subjects.\r\n2. Captain-Commandant Mommens :\r\nI have pleasure in informing you that Lt. Jean Charloteaux predicted\r\nthat the war would end on May 8th, 1945, at a radiesthesia sitting held in\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1947 Prediction of Date of End of the War\r\n1941 at a P.O.W. camp (Oflag VIIb) at Eichstatt in Bavaria. A small\r\ngroup of radiesthesists, beginners and others, practised the art, and it was\r\nduring one of our sittings that Charloteaux foretold the date of the end of\r\nthe war. We laughed at him a bit, for we all believed the war would end\r\nsooner. ^\r\n\u2022 - .\r\nt\r\n3. Major Flenry :\r\nI am happy to supply the information asked. I was a P.O.W. in Germany from 1940 to 1945. In 1940 I made acquaintance with Lt Jean\r\nCharloteaux. In the course of our long captivity in the same camps we\r\nbecame very friendly and I was able to help\" him with various pieces of\r\nscientific information which he needed for a book he was preparing. It was published after his return to Belgium.\r\nIn the second half of 1943, on a date I cannot precisely recall, in the course\r\nof conversation at Prenzlau camp, Lt Charloteaux told me he had foretold,\r\nby means of the pendulum, that the war in Europe would end on May 8,\r\n1945. Events confirmed this prediction. Although I cannot remember\r\nthe exact date of this conversation, I am absolutely sure it was earlier than\r\nJanuary, 1944. . . , ,\r\n4. Captain Marcel Boque : In June, 1943, Lt Jean Charloteaux arrived at Oflag IIa Prenzlau,\r\n(where I was) from Oflag Xd. He was questioned, in the room where I was, about the end of the war. He gave the date, May 8, 1945. I made\r\na note of it thinking what a laugh I would have at prediction by radiesthesia if it did not come oft'. To my great astonishment, I had to acknowledge, when the date arrived, that he had hit on the exact day.\r\n5. Captain Raymond Troye : Iwas walking with Lt Jean Charloteaux in the courtyard of the P.O.W.\r\ncamp at Prenzlau in A^ugust, 1943. A comrade came up to us and asked\r\nCharloteaux if it was true that he had foretold that the war would end on May 8, 1945. He replied that the pendulum had indeed indicated that\r\ndate. I scolded Lt Charloteaux for tr^dng to take us all in, but he said he\r\nhad made his enquir}^ perfectlj' seriously. I made a note of what he said,\r\nintending to rub in his mistake later on. But when we came to May 8,\r\n1945, I had to bear witness to the accuracy of the prediction when Lt\r\nCharloteaux reminded me of it.\r\n6. Captain J. Lippens : One day in 1941, while I was walking in the courtyard of P.O.W. camp\r\nVIIb at Eichstatt, I happened to meet Charloteaux. We were both in- terned there and I had known him for a long time. I chaffed him. \" Well,\r\nyou wizard,\" I said, \" can you tell me if we shall be much longer in this\r\ncamp and if the war will soon be over? \" \" Oh, yes,\" he said, \" we are nothing like finished with our exasperating time here, and I can't foresee an end to the war until 1945\u2014Mav 8, to be exact.\" I attached no importance to this date and never asked him how he arrived at it. It was only at the beginning of 1945 that I asked him if he still stuck to that date, and he\r\nsaid he did. After hostilities were over, he hunted me up to get me to sign a statement about the date, which I did without hesitation.\r\nio6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1947\r\n7. Colonel M. Scoky : During the winter of 1942-43, as a P.O.W. at Oflag Xd at Fischbeck, I had Charloteaux as my fellow prisoner in Barrack XI. I knew he was\r\ninterested in radiesthesia and we were not backward in teasing him about\r\nhis rod and his pendulum. One day, when he and his room-mates were\r\ntalking about the end of our captivity, he announced to us that, thanks to\r\nhis paraphernalia in which we entirely disbelieved, he could assure us that\r\nthe war would end on May 8, 1945. On the day of the German surrender,\r\nMay 8, 1945, in the camp at Prenzlau, he reminded me of his prediction,\r\nwhich had gone out of my mind. I signed a statement attesting the fact\r\nof his prediction.\r\n8. Major Vandermeersch : 1 am very glad to confirm the statement made in the Revue Internationale\r\nde Radiesthesie that Lt Charloteaux, in 1943 or 1944, foretold that hostilities would end on May 8, 1945.\r\nThe length of time which has passed and the small amount of importance\r\nI attached to Charloteaux' numerous affirmations, as to which I was very\r\nsceptical, make it impossible for me to give you details of the circumstances\r\nin which he made his prediction. Lt Charloteaux was billeted in the room\r\nof which I was head, so he was one of my daily associates and I paid no more attention to his remarks than to those of the other men in the room.\r\nIt was only on May 8, 1945, when the happy news of the end of the war\r\ncame, that I recalled that Charloteaux had given us that date in advance\r\nand felt that I owed it to him to testify to this fact.\r\n9. Commandant Dungelhoeff :\r\nI have known Lt Charloteaux many years during my captivity in Germany. He used to make experiments in radiesthesia and to teach his\r\nfellow-prisoners the principles and methods. I assisted at\u2014or heard of\r\na lot of experiments that resulted in failures, but some of them were really\r\nsuccessful. Although I don't believe very much in the power of radiesthesia to detect more than is actually in existence, and especially to predict\r\nthe future, I must admit that some months\u2014let us say two or three, or perhaps four\u2014before the end of the war, some fellow-prisoners were\r\nchattering about a roll-call and teasing Lt Charloteaux in a friendly manner\r\nabout his so-called prophecies. Lt Charloteaux answered that in spite of\r\nall that people might say, the war would be ended about the 7th or 8th of\r\nMay. When Germany actually capitulated on that date, Lt Charloteaux\r\nreminded me of that conversation and asked me to be a witness, which I had no reason to refuse.\r\n[There appears to be no doubt that M. Charloteaux made a precise and\r\naccurate prediction of the date of the end of the war several years before it took place. Of the nine witnesses who replied to the Research Officer's\r\nenquiry, two testify to having heard of the prediction in 1941, two in 1942,\r\nfour in \"1943 and one in 1944. The odds against a chance fulfilment would\r\nbe in the order of 1000 to i, or more. A great many predictions about the\r\nend of the war, made by mediums and others, were not borne out by events.\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1947 Reactions of Audience to Experiment with Pendulums 107\r\nM. Charloteaux does not appear to be an infallible diviner ; several of the\r\nwitnesses mention that many of his efforts were unsuccessful. But this case, in which the actual day was repeatedly specified, stands out as re- markable.]\r\nA NOTE ON THE REACTIONS OF AN AUDIENCE TO A\r\nSIMPLE EXPERIMENT WITH PENDULUMS\r\nEric Cuddon ' ~\r\nAt the conclusion of a lecture on Hypnotism at The International Institute\r\nfor Experimental Metaphysics at Walton House, Walton Street, on Thursday, July loth, 1947, I demonstrated the following simple experiment with\r\npendulums in order to show the audience how very easily they could be\r\ndeceived in ascribing to psychic or paranormal causes that which had in\r\nfact a very simple and perfectly normal explanation.\r\nThree clear glass orange squash bottles were displayed upon a large and\r\nfirm table which was provided in the centre with a ground glass inset about\r\na foot square beneath which was an electric light. The bottles which were\r\nplaced upon this inset were therefore fully illuminated from underneath.\r\nIn each bottle, suspended from a hook in the cork, was a length of black\r\ncotton with a further hook attached to the end to form a pendulum. The\r\nlength of each pendulum was different. The bottles were labelled \" A\r\n\" \" B \" and \" C \" by means of marked envelopes stuck to the tops of the\r\ncorks.\r\nWith very little practice it is possible, not only to set any particular pendulum in motion, but also to control the nature and direction of its movements, by means of deliberate pushing with the fingers which rest lightly\r\nupon the table. This can be achieved without any visible motion of the\r\nfingers being discernible.\r\nIf the table used is light and not very firm the pendulums can be set in\r\nmotion by the unconscious impulses given to the fingers by sitters who\r\nconcentrate their attention and desire to move any particular pendulum.\r\nThe fact that the pendulums are of different length, and hence of different\r\nperiodicity, is the reason why only one pendulum will be set in motion at a time ; the impulses which are correct for building up the movement of one pendulum are incorrect i.e. out of phase with each of the others.\r\nBy previous arrangement Dr West and Mr Douglas Craggs had been\r\nbriefed to offer themselves as sitters when a request was made for volunteers and both had practised the art of intentional control of the pendulums\r\nby indiscernible pushing or pressure of the fingers upon the surface of the\r\ntable. The audience was told that they were about to witness an experiment\r\nwhich they might well think was an improvement upon a Planchette. It was suggested that the bottles could be taken to represent my Spirit\r\nGuides as follows: \" A \" = Amenhotep my Egyptian Guide; \"B\" =\r\nBabs, a little girl Guide, and \" C \" = Ching, my Chinese Guide, though I sometimes called him \" I Can Li \" as his answers were often unreliable and\r\nin opposition to the answers of Amenhotep.\r\nio8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1947\r\nThe difference in the lengths of the pendulums was explained by the fact that of course each Guide operated upon a different wave length. Volunteer sitters were then called for and four offered their services i.e. two apart\r\nfrom my Stooges. As each came up to the table I asked their names and\r\nannounced them to the audience. The object of this was to suggest to the\r\naudience that I did not know any of them, otherwise why should it be\r\nnecessary for me to ask their names. At first I sat in the centre with two\r\nsitters upon each side and later left them on their own whilst I pretended to concentrate from several feet away upon the particular Spirit Guide, i.e. pendulum, which it was desired to operate. Upon each occasion the re- quisite pendulum functioned as desired. I then requested someone to ask\r\na question of the pendulums. The question was \" Is this done by Spirits.'\"\r\nAn oscillation would mean Yes ancl a gyration would mean No. Amenhotep answered \" Yes \" but \" I Can Li \" said \" No.\"\r\nIn view of this conflict I told the audience it was up to them to decide\r\nand put to them the following questions and asked them to vote. The\r\nresult was as under : Did the pendulums only appear to move because I hypnotised you into\r\nthinking they did.? Votes : o. Was their movement due to paranormal i.e. psychic means? Votes : 14. Was this due to power of sitters apart from me? Votes : 6. Was this due to power of sitters plus my psychic help? Votes : 8. Was it due to normal means? Votes : 5. By involuntary pushing? Votes : 3. Was it due to intentional deceitful pushing by me alone? Votes : i. Was it due to intentional deceitful pushing by me plus accomplices among\r\nthe sitters? Votes : 2. It should be noted that the last three votes were those of Mrs. Goldney\r\nand two of mv friends from the Magic Circle, all of whom were in the know,\r\nso that in fact not a single person in the audience as such was prepared to vote that it was due to intentional pushing.\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that even after I had explained the whole modus\r\noperandi in the simplest manner there were still two people in the audience, one a woman doctor and the other an apparently intelligent man, who in- sisted that the pendulums could be moved by the power of thought alone\r\nwithout physical contact with the table and were most anxious to attempt\r\nto do so, although I pointed out that I was personally not prepared to waste my time in any such fruitless endeavour and that although I had a very good opinion of myself and my brain power I was not quite so conceited as to anticipate success from such an experiment!\r\nIt is really astonishing to what lengths a desire for something \" psychic \"\r\nwill lead otherwise normal people, and I am beginning to think we should\r\nfound a \" Society for the Investigation of Psychic Seekers.\"\r\nOCT. -NOV. 1947 E.S.P. Tests: A Summary of Results 109\r\nE.S.P. TESTS : A SUMMARY OF RESULTS\r\nD. J. West\r\nExperimenters in this field are often criticised for unfair selection of results. In order to forestall this allegation I am reporting here all the hitherto unpublished tests carried out since Maj' i944) when I first began to keep full records of all trials performed under test conditions.^\r\nResults being: negative, the conditions are not described in detail ; but\r\nit is advisable to have at least a summary of the scores. It is only by recording all results, both negative and positive, that we will ever be able to determine the true frequency of E.S.P. performance. It must be noted,\r\nhowever, that the percipients tested in these experiments were most of\r\nthem specially selected for their reputations as successful telepathic subjects.

It was decided to charge no\r\nsubscription and have no definite membership scheme, but after the first meeting more than 80 undergraduates declared themselves willing to take\r\npart in experiments. A committee of five undergraduates (C. S. O.'D\r\nScott, A. M. Western, J. D. Proctor, J. Painter, and G. Bielstein) was\r\nformed to plan and direct experiments and control the affairs of the Group.\r\nIn the Lent term 1947 Professor Broad was so good as to accept the Presidency of the Group.\r\nDuring the academic year 1946-47 a large amount of experimental work\r\nwas done. Lack of space forbids more than a brief summary of this programme.\r\nI . A large experiment under general (undifferentiated) E.S.P. conditions\r\nin which 54 people contributed 16,650 guesses. A group of agents were all simultaneously presented with a number target and a group of percipients were asked to record their guesses. The experiment was aimed primarily\r\nat finding a percipient. Taken as a whole the results were negative, and it\r\nis probable that if there are any interesting effects in the results they will only be revealed by an elaborate analysis.\r\nt\r\nW\r\nu\r\nD\r\nS\r\nInf.\r\nH25\/25 = H25\/100\r\nR\r\nT\r\nAss.\r\nPC\r\nC\r\n112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1947\r\n2.

In the\r\nhope of encouraging phenomena it was decided to begin with lax conditions.\r\nOne percipient gave very striking results, and the controls were immediately\r\ntightened. His performance then dropped, though remaining just\r\nsignificant (p=:2:-o5), but soon afterwards the experiment had to be stopped\r\nowing to the reluctance of the percipient to continue the work.\r\n4. An experiment suggested by Dr Thouless and reported in detail below, which, although it failed in its object, did include one significant\r\nresult.\r\n5. An experiment aimed at discovering any comparative effects of\r\ndifferent working conditions on performance in E.S.P. Neither overall\r\nevidence for E.S.P. nor differential effects were observed\u2014though the\r\nnumber of guesses obtained was perhaps too small to give an opportunity\r\nfor any paranormal effect to show itself.\r\n6. Two experiments in which encouraging results were obtained and\r\nwhich are to be continued in the coming year. These experiments will be\r\nreported when complete.\r\n7. Some experiments on hypnosis which, though interesting to the\r\npsychologist, were not successful in raising performance in E.S.P.\r\n8. A number of isolated experiments with negative results which are either too short or too trivial to be worth describing. The Group also held\r\nitself in readiness to investigate any reports of local and contemporary\r\nspontaneous phenomena, but none was received.\r\nAll experiments and activities of the Group are fully recorded.\r\nA total of four significant results was therefore obtained in some eight\r\nexperiments, which is a most encouraging conclusion to the year's work.\r\nDuring the year the Group had the good fortune to hear talks from three\r\nmembers of the S.P.R. Council : Dr Thouless, a general introductory talk ; Dr Robertson on \" Is Psychical Research a Branch of Physics? \"\r\n; MrTyrrell on \" The Object of Psychical Research.\"\r\nThe Committee would like to express their thanks to all those who have\r\noffered us their services, in particular to Prof. Broad, Dr Thouless, Dr\r\nDingvv'all and Dr West for their help and advice, and especially to Dr\r\nDingwall, without whose generous financial aid the Group could have\r\nneither begun nor continued to exist. C. S. O'D. Scott\r\nEXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION BY THE CAMBRIDGE\r\nPSYCHICAL RESEARCH GROUP\r\nReport by Dr R. H. Thouless\r\nThe experimental investigation here reported on was carried out by members of the Cambridge Psychical Research Group during the winter of\r\n1946-47. The plan of the experiment was suggested by myself but the ex- periment itself was organised by Mr C. S. O'D. Scott and Mr A. M. Western. The somewhat arduous series of experimental sittings was carried\r\nout by Mr Dodd, Miss Salter, Mr Beale, Mr Ventura, Mr Painter, MrNelder, Mr Macmanus, Mr Smith, Mr Greenhalgh and Miss Braithwaite.\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1947 Cambridge Psychical Research Group 113\r\nThe problem with which it was concerned was that of the relation of\r\nability as percipient to ability as agent in extra-sensory perception. V\/e\r\nhave abundant evidence that different individuals differ in their capacity\r\nto succeed as percipients in experiments on psi cognition ; we are relatively\r\nuncertain to what extent success in such experiments depends on the agent.\r\nThe present experiment was designed to discover the relative importance\r\nof the individual peculiarities of percipient and agent in determining\r\nsuccess in experiments on psi cognition, and to enquire whether there was\r\nany correlation between ability as percipient and ability as agent. Although the results of the experiment were wholly negative, this was not due\r\nto any defect in design or carrying out of the experiment but to the unfortunate fact that (with one possible exception) none of the participants\r\nshowed measurable psi cognitive success. It seems, therefore, worth while\r\nto publish the method of the enquiry in the hope that it may be carried out\r\nin future by someone who has at his disposal a sufficient number of subjects\r\nwho can obtain consistently better than chance results in such experiments.\r\nThere were ten subjects of the experiments, each of whom did six runs\r\nof guesses through a pack of cards with each of the other nine subjects.\r\nFor three of these runs he was acting as agent while the other subject was\r\npercipient, while in the remaining three runs their roles were reversed.\r\nThe cards used were packs of ordinary playing cards from which the twelve\r\ncourt cards had been removed. A guess was counted as a success only if it was completely right (in suit and number). Thus each percipient made\r\n120 guesses with each agent with a mean chance expectation of three right,\r\nand every subject of the experiment acted as both agent and percipient\r\nwith every other subject, making a total number of 1,080 guesses as percipient and acting as agent for an equal number.\r\nThe number of successes obtained in each of these ninety sittings is shown in the following table. The agent and percipient sat in the same room but back to back so that\r\nthe percipient could not be guided by visual clues. An observer sat facing\r\nthe agent across a table. The percipients were not informed as to their success or failure until the whole series of sittings had been completed.\r\nAgents\r\nD Sa Be\r\nPercipients \" V P N M Sm G\r\ni\r\nBr\r\nTotals\r\nD 4 2 3 4 2 3\r\n-> 4 4 29\r\nSa 3 2 6 5 5 4 5 5 3\u00ab\r\nBe 2 0 6 5 5\r\nI 4\r\n2\r\nV 0 0 5 3 5 4 4\r\nI 4 26\r\nP 5 5 2 8 6 2 3 J \/ N 4\r\n-) 2 3 0 4\r\n2 I 3 22\r\nM 4 6 2 3 2 0 2 0 25\r\nSm 2 4 5 4 4 3 4 2 I 29\r\nG I 2 4 3 4\r\n--> 4\r\n2 2 25\r\nBr I 2 2 5 4 4\r\n2 4 3 27\r\nTotals 20 ?6 29 26 34 32 39 26 24 27 283\r\n114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research oct.-nov. 1947\r\nFigures were also obtained for the numbers of hits on the cards one before and one after the target card but, since these also were not significant,\r\nthey are not included in the above table. The mean chance expectations for totals both in columns and rows is 27,\r\nwhile that for the grand total is 270. The observed deviation of + 1 3 in the\r\ngrand total is quite insignificant (C.R. = -8, P = '4). Nor does there seem\r\nto be any indication that this insignificance of total deviation is the result\r\nof a small number of successful subjects having their scores swamped by a\r\nlarger number of unsuccessful ones. It is true that Macmanus as percipient\r\nscores twelve more than mean chance expectation which as a separate score would be significant, but the odds are no more than about two to one against\r\na score of this size occurring once amongst twenty scores. And although\r\ntwo other scores of comparable size are found amongst the agents, this is insuflicient for significance.\r\nThe only real evidence for the results being not wholly chance determined\r\nis from one run through a pack of forty cards with Macmanus as percipient\r\nand Painter as agent in which the score was seven whereas mean chance\r\nexpectation is one. If treated as a single observation the odds against this\r\noccurring by chance would be enormous (P = -000055). is, however, the\r\nselected best of 270 runs, and the likelihood of such a value occurring by\r\nchance at least once in 270 trials is about -015 [i.e. about 65 to i against).\r\nSince neither the grand total nor the separate totals of agents or percipients deviate appreciably from what we should expect by chance, it is extremely unlikely that we should find evidence of the effects we are looking\r\nfor. In the hope, however, that this experiment may be repeated some time\r\nwith more positive material, I will go through the further steps of the enquiry.\r\nI. Proof that agents differ amongst themselves in psi capacity would be\r\nprovided by the observed variance between the agents' totals being significantly greater than that to be expected on the hypothesis that there are only\r\nrandom differences between the totals of agents. It does not seem quite\r\ncorrect to do this by the ordinary method of analysis of variance since the\r\ntable differs from that of the usual form in the fact that there is no principal\r\n, diagonal (since there is no experiment in which the subjects act both as agent and percipient). Nor does it seem satisfactory to calculate the\r\ntheoretical variance from the formula Npq where p = i\/40 and q = 39\/40,\r\nsince this will underestimate the expected variance between agents if subjects are scoring positively. If, however, p is taken as the observed proportion of successes and q as the observed proportion of failures, this for- mula can correctly be used to estimate the expected variance between\r\nagents. In the present case p is 283\/10800 ( = -026) and q is 105 17\/ 10800\r\n( = \u2022974). N (the total number of guesses per agent) is 1080. The ex- pected variance between agents' totals is, therefore, 1080 x -026 x -974 =\r\nThe observed variance is the sum of the squares of the deviations of each\r\nagent's total from the mean of 28-3, divided by the number of degrees of\r\nfreedom which is 9\r\n{i.e. one less than the number of agents). The sum of\r\nthe squares of deviations from the mean is ('7)^ + (97)\" + etc., which comes\r\nto 250. The observed variance between agents is, therefore 250\/9 = 27.8,\r\nwhich is remarkably near to the theoretical value, showing that this set of\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1947 Cambridge Psychical Research Group 115\r\nexperiments gives no evidence of agents differing amongst themselves in\r\nthe scores obtained by them.\r\n2. The problem of the reality of differences between percipients is the same. The expected variance is the same as in the case of agents (27-4).\r\nThe observed variance between percipients is 29-6. Although somewhat\r\nlarger than in the last case, the difference falls far short of significance\r\nsince (by Fisher's tables of variance ratios) the observed variance would\r\nhave to be about twice the expected variance for the diiference to be significant. These results, therefore, also provide no evidence of a real differ- ence between percipients.\r\n3. If it had been found that there was a real difference between agents\r\nand between percipients, the next question would be whether these\r\ndifferences were correlated, i.e. whether a good percipient tended also to be a good agent. Here the product-moment correlation is - -08, which\r\nis (as might be expected) wholly insignificant.\r\nI should like to end by expressing appreciation of the amount of hard\r\nwork on the part of organisers and experimenters which went into these\r\nexperiments, and my regret that this hard work has borne so little fruit. That is liable to happen in experimental work in psychical research. Wemust hope that the time will soon come w\"hen we can improve methods of\r\nexperimenting (by the use of drugs or other means) so that we can get positive results whenever we like. Then we shall have overcome the principal\r\ndifficulty in experimental advance in psychical research.\r\nR. H. Thouless\r\nEXPERIMENTERS' REPORT ON CONDITIONS OF THE\r\nINVESTIGATION\r\nThe forty-five separate sittings involved in the experiment all took place\r\nduring the Lent Term 1947. The problem of organising such a large\r\namount of work during a term largely occupied by academic activities was\r\nnot easy, and it was decided that the experimenters themselves could not\r\nbe present at more than a small proportion of the sittings. Accordingly a sheet of detailed instructions was issued and the subjects were asked to arrange the sittings amongst themselves. These instructions were designed\r\nto secure constancy of conditions and to safeguard against faulty recording\r\nand conscious or unconscious fraud in so far as limited and always variable\r\nfacilities permitted. At least one observer was present at every sitting and\r\ntwenty-eight people took part as observers in the whole series of sittings.\r\nThe instruction sheet is given at the end of this report.\r\nIt was felt, nevertheless, that even if the results had been significant the\r\nnature of the conditions themselves and the doubtful efficacy of written\r\ninstructions to secure their own fulfilment made the experiment inadequate\r\nto provide, in itself, conclusive evidence of paranormality. If positive results had been obtained, therefore, a further test would have been carried\r\nout with some of the more successful pairs of subjects under the most\r\nstringent conditions to eliminate all possibility of spurious success. If\r\nii6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research oct.-nov. 1947\r\nsuccess had continued, it would have been argued that with subjects who\r\nhave demonstrated genuine powers there is Uttle reason for taking a highly\r\nsuspicious and sceptical attitude towards evidence concerning the laws of\r\noperation of these powers. However improbable E.S.P. may be it is scarcely reasonable to take the attitude that, given E.S.P., any characteristic\r\nthat it may be claimed to have is highly improbable. Sceptical criticism\r\nwould be directed against the properly controlled tests, not against the\r\nmain series of sittings. If the controlled tests had failed to give positive\r\nresults the validity of the main series would have been a matter of opinion ; but the experimenters feel bound to state that in that event they personally\r\nwould not feel entirely convinced of the vaUdity of any evidence of paranormality derived from the main series alone.\r\nDetails of exact experimental conditions for each sitting and procedure\r\nto eliminate miscounting etc., were recorded but are not included in this\r\nreport, as the conclusions of the experiment are almost entirely negative.\r\nIt is known that in at least three sittings the conditions were not exactly in\r\naccordance with the instructions. It should perhaps be mentioned that one of these three included the single run between Painter and Macmanus\r\nin which the only evidence in the whole series for anything but chance determined was obtained. During this run the agent and percipient were\r\nfacing one another instead of being back to back, and the percipient was\r\nblindfold.\r\nThe experimenters would like to express their thanks and those of the\r\nGroup to Dr Thouless for his help and advice and for the above report on\r\nthe purpose, method, and conclusions of the experiment.\r\n. ^ C.

Compiled by Miss E. B. Gibbes from the scripts of ^^liss Geraldine Cummins. Rider, London, 1946. 12s. 6d.\r\nThis book is a record of twelve cases of apparent communications from\r\ndeceased persons recorded by Miss Cummins, mainly by \" automatic \"\r\nwriting. Each case has a feature which distinguishes it from the usual type\r\nof spirit communications ; in most of them the communicator was completely unknown to the medium and in several of them to the sitter also,\r\nytt man}'' correct facts were recorded.\r\nThey include the well-known Pearl Tie Pin case, already published in\r\nSir William Barrett's book On the Threshold of the Unseen and Mrs Hester\r\nDowden's Voices from the Void. Miss Cummins was only the sitter and\r\nMrs Dowden used the Ouija Board. Given the facts, it would be interesting if some of our members would suggest a normal explanation of this case. Several of the other cases approach, if they do not reach this standard.\r\nThose of Bob F., Flenry Boyce and Captain J. M. are of special interest\r\nfrom this angle, though from the point of view of a scientific society, there\r\nis insufficient corroboration of the facts and the possibility of selection,\r\nconscious or unconscious, from the original records. Few readers, hov\/ever,\r\nwill not be prepared to accept the good faith of Miss Cummins and Miss\r\nGibbes.\r\nApart from this, the interest of the book lies in the high standard of\r\naccuracy in Miss Cummins' work in such a number of cases, the evidence\r\nof continuing personality in those of T. M., Elizabeth B., and the Ross\r\nsisters, and a picture of the next stage of life very difficult for those with\r\npreconceived notions of \" heaven \" to accept.\r\nTwo features deserve special notice. In the case of Elizabeth B., a rather backward child purporting to send a message to her mother, the first communication was in rather stilted language and seemed to her mother\r\nii8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research oct.-nov. 1947\r\nnot to be at all in character. Later on the wording became quite natural\r\nand typical of the child who said (p. 61) \" I have been helped by someone\r\nhere to speak. The first time he called me he did the speaking for me because I did not know how to write. So I expect you were a bit puzzled by\r\nwhat was said. He tried to say for me what I wanted to say but of course he talked his own way. Now I know what to do.\" This of course referred\r\nto Astor, Miss Cummins' \" guide \" and is evidence in favour of a separate\r\npersonality.\r\nIn another case (T. M.) the communicator explained the possible causes\r\nof error thus : \"I see the words coming on a glass as I think the thought\r\nthey embody. But now and then wrong words get in and the thought is not\r\nalways completed just exactly as I think it.\" This indicates that telepathy\r\nis the modus operandi in this case, as explained by Myers (The Dorr Case,\r\nProc. 191 1\r\n) where he says it is the normal method and consists of the excitation of existing ideas in the medium's mind.\r\nThis is not a book that would convince or even perhaps influence a complete sceptic. Indeed nothing but personal experience ever will. But any\r\nperson with a scientific mind and no strong prejudice and a little knowledge\r\nof the subject will find it well worth study. There cannot be too manybooks of this type and very few are so well presented as this. Miss Gibbes\r\nis well aware of the many pitfalls in her path and the need for accurate\r\nrecording, as well as of the criticisms to which evidence of this kind is ex- posed. She answers as many as she can in advance but in a well balanced manner and without bias. B. A. C.\r\nProblerns in Abnormal Behaviour. Nathaniel Thornton. Pp. 238.\r\nPhiladelphia, 1946.\r\nThis book does not deal with supernormal phenomena, but it is of\r\ninterest to all who need to know something of the complexities of humanpersonality. Many aspects of abnormal psychology are touched upon,\r\nincluding such diverse topics as neurosis, the interpretation of dreams,\r\ninsanity, psycho-analysis, psychological types, hypnotism, narco-analysis,\r\nderangements of the sexual impulse and epilepsy. To do justice to any one\r\nof these subjects would have required several volumes. The present book\r\nis in the nature of a series of fleeting sketches rather than careful expositions.\r\nIt might have been better if the range had been more restricted and the\r\ntreatment more detailed.\r\nNotwithstanding this limitation, it is a useful work, and it will serve as an\r\nintroduction to the many-sided problems of human mentality. The value\r\nof the book is increased by the author's healthy habit of defining terms, as well as his objective attitude to the divergent theories which complicate the\r\nsubject matter. In discussing the genesis of mental abnormality, equal\r\nprominence is given to environmental factors (which determine the form\r\nof a neurosis) and to hereditary and constitutional factors (which determine\r\nthe incidence of insanities and sexual aberrations).\r\nIn the section of the book dealing with sex, it is interesting to note howmany well-known psychical researchers {e.g. Dessoir, Moll, SchrenckNotzing) have been experts in this subject also.\r\n^ D. J. W.\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1947 Correspondence 119\r\nThe Journal of Parapsychology. Vol. XI, no. 2, June 1947.\r\nThis number of The Journal opens with an obituary notice, by the Editor,\r\nof Dr C. E. Stuart whose death this year was a sad loss to American Psychical Research.\r\nJ. M. Bevan compared a group of twelve subjects doing E.S.P. experiments in light and in darkness. They scored above mean chance expectation in light and below in darkness with a significant difference between the scores in the two conditions.\r\nJ.- G. Pratt has made a further analysis of position effects in the record\r\nsheets of P.K. experiments. The usual terminal salience effects are found\r\nwith both high and low aim. Since success was found to an appreciable\r\nextent only at the beginning and end of columns, it seemed that a large part\r\nof the test was contributing little or nothing to the final total, and that it might be w'orth while to design tests in such a way as to eliminate these unprofitable areas. There is an important contribution by the late C. E. Stuart and other\r\nworkers on the relation between E.S.P. results and personality measure- ments of which the most significant finding is that those making \" ex- pansive \" drawings scored more highly in clairvoyant perceptions of\r\ndrawings than did those subjects who made \" compressive \" drawings.\r\nIn view of the importance of such comparisons, it is a pity that a more\r\nadequate statistical technique of comparison is not used. It seems to me\r\nthat the comparison should not be between the total score in the two cases but between the number of individuals scoring respectively above and\r\nbelow chance in the two groups. No figures are given by which one can\r\nestimate whether the difference between the groups would also be significant if determined in this way. In view of the large number of subjects\r\nused (thirty-six expansive and fifty-nine compressive) it seems likely that it would. There is also a discussion by a physicist R. A.. McConnel as to whether such phenomena as P.K. are physical or non-physical.\r\nR. H. T.\r\nLIBRARY NOTICE\r\nThe Council is anxious that the Society's library should include all important books on psychical research and closely related subjects.

There would, of course, be no\r\nquestion of making public the contents of past Journals, which were obtained on the definite assurance that this would not be done.\r\nThe excellent recent issue (June-July), in which this rule was relaxed,\r\nshows, I think, that this policy is popular, and also that it is practical and\r\ndoes not lead to a scarcity of cases.\r\nIt might also be said that the printing in a ^uhWc Journal of cases which,\r\nalthough of some interest, are weak evidentially, would bring the Society\r\ninto disrepute. But if it should be held desirable to include any such cases when further evidence is unobtainable, an editorial note can always be\r\nincluded, pointing out the weaknesses. As this is the exact procedure that was adopted in the above-mentioned issue (a case of apparent retro- cognition), I do not think that this objection can be considered a serious\r\none.Moreover, the Journal is available at the British Museum, and, I believe,\r\nelsewhere. Surely the maintenance of this theoretical privacy is rather\r\nunnecessary.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n; A. M.

A Student\r\nmay be re-elected once, but not more than once. The Studentship is tenab)^ for one year, and the Student will be re- quired to devote a substantial part of the period of his tenure to investigating some problem in Psychical Research. The Student shall not, during\r\nthe tenure of his Studentship, engage in any other occupation to such an\r\nextent as would in the opinion of the Electors interfere with his course of\r\nresearch.\r\nThe Studentship will be of such value, not exceeding \u00a3300, as the Electors may award after considering the nature of the research which the\r\ncandidate proposes to undertake. The emolument will, in general, be paid\r\nhalf-yearly, and the first instalment will be paid on the quarter-day on\r\nwhich the tenure of the Studentship begins.\r\nThe Student shall, during the tenure of his Studentship, pursue to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Electors the course of research proposed by him in his\r\napplication ; provided that such course may be altered with the consent of\r\nthe Electors. The Electors will appoint a Supervisor with whom the\r\nStudent is to keep in regular touch. If the Electors shall report to the\r\nCouncil of Trinity College, Cambridge, that the Student is failing to pursue\r\nhis course of research with due diligence, the Council may, if they think fit, deprive him of his Studentship.\r\nApplications from candidates should be sent to Professor C. D. Broad,\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, before 3 May, 1948. In making his application a candidate should state his qualifications and claims, and his proposed\r\ncourse of research ; he may also submit any work which he has written,\r\npublished or unpublished. No testimonials are required from candidates\r\nwho are graduates of Cambridge University or women students on whom a\r\ntitle of a degree has been conferred by that University. Other candidates\r\nmust submit the names of three referees, and the Electors will not award\r\nthe Studentship to any such candidate until they have had a personal interview with him.\r\nThe election to the Studentship will take place in the Easter Term of\r\n1948, and, if a candidate be elected, his tenure will begin at Michaelmas\r\nfollowing the election. -, . , 31 October, 1947. . - ;\r\n';\r\n124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research DEC. 1947\r\nA VERIFIED REFERENCE IN AUTOMATIC WRITING\r\nIn the March-April, 1947, number of the Journal we printed an account of\r\nthe Hon. Mrs C. H. Gay's sitting with the trance medium, Mrs Bedford, at which information was given connected with the death of a man she knew\r\nslightly. Several facts, previously unknown to Mrs Gay, were verified by\r\nMrs B , in whose house the death occurred.\r\nMrs Gay writes of a further incident, which appears to be connected\r\nwith the same person, as follows : \" Last September Mrs B lent me her house while she and her husband were away. I had a strong inclination on the evening of September\r\n7th to try some automatic writing and I wrote the following sentences :\r\n' No need for more tests, but keys is one. Remind her of keys\u2014to do with\r\nholiday.' I got my husband to initial the script and a fortnight later when I saw Mrs B I asked her if it conveyed anytfiing to her as it was nonsense\r\nto me. She was astonished and amused and said it obviously related to an\r\nincident which had happened fifteen years ago and which she had not\r\nthought of for many years and had certainly never mentioned to me. She\r\nand her husband and this friend had been abroad together for a short holiday and on their return they found that they had all come away with their\r\nhotel bedroom keys in their pockets. They laughed over it a good deal. . . . She found her key in a drawer a long time afterwards.\"\r\nMr C. H. Gay writes : \" I am writing to verify the fact that my wife\r\nwrote the script containing the message for Mrs B ' Remind her of\r\nkeys\u2014to do with holiday'. This was on Sept. 7th, 1947, and I initialled and dated it.\" Mrs B writes : \" Mrs Gay has asked me to corroborate the extract which she sent you from her automatic script of Sept. 7th, 1947,\r\ncontaining a message purporting to come from a friend of mine who died\r\nhere in 1946 and reminding me (as an identity test) of \" Keys to do with a holiday'. The incident was as follows : My husband, this friend and I went abroad for a short holiday together in 1928. On our return journey\r\nwe stayed in Paris for two nights, and when we got back home we found we\r\nhad the keys of the two bedrooms in our pockets. After a long discussion on the difficulties of posting them back because of Customs, etc., we decided to keep them. I found mine in a drawer a few years ago and joked\r\nwith my friend about it. It was a trivial joke and I had certainly never mentioned it to Mrs Gay nor had my husband, and I had not thought of\r\nthe incident for a long time until Mrs Gay asked me in Sept., 1947, if\r\n' keys and a holiday ' in connection with this friend meant anything. Then\r\nI said ' Yes, it did ' and I went to the drawer and showed her the Paris\r\nhotel key.\"\r\nAN UNFULFILLED PRECOGNITIVE DREAM\r\nOn the morning of Oct. 29th, 1947, the Research Officer received the fol- lowing letter from Mr Godley, the gentleman whose racing dreams were\r\nreported in the June-July number of the Journal.\r\n\" Three nights ago my friend Alan Beesley dreamt that Claro had won\r\nDEC. 1947 An Unfulfilled Precognitive Dream\r\nthe Cambridgeshire. This race is being run at Newmarket to-morrow,\r\nWednesday. I was naturally excited by Alan's dream, in view of my own\r\nexperience, and put on a fiver each way for luck.\r\nLast night, I myself dreamt that Claro had won. I dreamt that I was\r\nwalking about Oxford at the time of the race, and then overheard some\r\npeople discussing the result in a shop. I rushed up to them and said, \" Do\r\nyou know what won the Cambridgeshire \" and they replied, \" Yes, Claro\r\nwon, but there were only four runners.\" I realised that I had won a lot of\r\nmoney, and then woke up.\r\nI am perfectly aware that as I had backed the horse before the dream I had\u2014and have\u2014a special interest in it winning, and that the dream is very\r\nlikely to be a perfectly ordinary one, representing what I should like to happen. But just out of interest I am writing to tell you of it, and you\r\nshould receive this on the morning of the race.\"\r\nOn the afternoon on which this letter was received the horse Claro came\r\n7th in a field of 38 with starting odds 15-2. It is a pity that the failure of\r\nthis dream ^premonition breaks Mr Godley's interesting run of successful\r\npredictions. It must be noted, however, that in this case there was not the same feeling of certainty that it would come off.\r\nA CASE OF APPARENT RETROCOGNITION by J. T. Evans.\r\nStatement about a Devonshire Cove\r\nThe statement published in the^oz\/rna\/ for June-July, 1947, on observations\r\nmade in March, 1938, in a Devonshire Cove calls for careful consideration.\r\nIt may be useful to examine the features which seemed abnormal, each one\r\nseparately from the others, to see whether any normal explanation is reasonably acceptable.\r\nIt is unfortunate, first, that eighteen months should have elapsed after the event before the account was committed to paper and, secondly, that seven years more passed before publication became possible, with the\r\nresult that Mr Spence is no longer able to supply further details. In the\r\nfollowing notes an attempt has therefore been made to put forward possible\r\nalternative normal explanations of the various features of the case in the\r\nlight of the facts given in the statement and of such other information as it has proved possible to collect on the site. It will be remembered that Mr Spence visited a Devonshire cove on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in March, 1938, and came to the opinion that during parts of the Tuesday and Thursday visits the local geography, the tides and the atmosphere were abnormal and different from what\r\nthey were on the Wednesday and on the rest of the Tuesday and Thursday\r\nvisits. Mr Spence put forward the hypothesis that during the abnormal\r\nperiods he had been viewing the locality as it was at some period in the past.\r\nThe headings used in the following notes are the same as in the statement.\r\nThe Atmosphere. .\r\n, The changes in the atmosphere evidently made a considerable impression on Mr Spence, but since the experience was wholly personal to him it seems difficult to comment helpfully upon it.\r\n126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nThe Tide.\r\nThe statement says that on the Tuesday the tide was out and Mr Spence was able to enter the cave, but on Wednesday and Thursday at about\r\nthe same time as on Tuesday the tide was in and the cave inlet was under\r\nwater.\r\nThe approach to the inlet in which the cave is situated is cut off at high\r\ntide. On the Tuesday, high tide was recorded as 9.34 a.m. and it is presumed that Mr Spence arrived at the beach some time later in the morning\r\nwhen the tide had fallen some distance. He was able to enter the cave inlet. On the Wednesday, when he arrived at about the same time, the tide was\r\nhigher, since it gained 30 or 40 minutes each day, and the approach to the\r\ninlet was cut off. On the Thursday, the tide was higher still and Mr Spence\r\nhad to wait for it to fall before being able to reach the cave inlet. These conditions are what would normally be expected and no ex- planation would be necessary were it not that the tide is stated to have\r\nbeen \" right out \" oh Tuesday and \" right up \" at about the same time on Wednesday and Thursday.\r\nIt should be noted that (i) the sandy part of the beach at Man Sands is\r\nflat, and 30 or 40 minutes make a considerable difference to the appearance\r\nof the beach ; moreover the sand elsewhere is broader and higher than in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the cave inlet and a large expanse of sand\r\nis exposed not far away at the time when the approach to the cave inlet is\r\nstill under water and thus the tide looks lower elsewhere than at the cave\r\ninlet, and (2) the tide on the Wednesday and Thursday is described variously as being \" right up \", \" fairly full \" and \" practically full \" so that it seems possible that the tidal conditions and the times of arrival were not\r\nobserved with much precision. There seemed no reason at the time whythey should be.\r\nThe hallucinatory explanation requires either that Mr Spence really\r\nwalked across the beach at high tide on Tuesday under the impression that\r\nit was low tide, without even getting his clothes wet, or~else that the whole\r\nTuesday visit was an hallucination. Both these explanations seem more\r\ndifficult to accept than the one suggested above, namely, that his three visits were made round about that state of the tide at which the approach to the cave inlet became uncovered.\r\nThe Cave. - The statement says that the cave was easily found on the Tuesday but\r\nnot on the Thursday when it appeared that a landslide had occurred.\r\nThe cave passing right underneath Crabrock Point at Man Sands, near Brixham, must be known to many people. The north-west opening, in a\r\nlittle inlet at the southern end of Man Sands, is above high water mark but\r\nthe floor of the south-east opening is under water even at low spring tides. In the cliff face above the north-west opening, the one referred to in the\r\nstatement, there is a shatter-zone of loose material from which it is evident\r\nthat falls of shale are not uncommon ; loose shale lies in a large heap on\r\nthe floor of this entrance of the cave and largely obscures it. Mr Spence's\r\nsuggestion that there had been a landslip between the Tuesday andThursday visits is thus quite a likely and a normal one.\r\nDEC. 1947 A Case of Apparent Retrocognition '. 127\r\nThe Path.\r\nThe statement says that Mr Spence clambered up a httle cHff path on the\r\nTuesday but could not find it on the Thursday when he looked for it from\r\nabove.\r\nThere are two rough paths up the cliff at the southern end of Man Sands\r\napproximately in the positions shown on the plan accompanying the state- ment. One of them is not very obvious and having \" clambered up \" it on Tuesday Mr Spence might well have had difficulty in finding it again when\r\nhe approached it from above on Thursday.\r\nThe Field.\r\nThe statement says that in the field between the cove and the wall Mr\r\nSpence found more bracken on Tuesday and Thursday than he did on\r\nWednesday.\r\nOn Tuesday and Thursday the route taken was not far from the cliff edge\r\nand lay through bracken and brambles. On Wednesday the route was\r\ninland and lay over grass. The accompanying reproduction of part of the 1\/2,500 Ordnance Map,\r\n(Sheet No. Devonshire 128,10, Second Edition, 1906,) on which I have\r\nmarked the areas of bracken, brambles, etc., shows that the cliff-side route\r\nmay well have had more bracken and brambles than the inland route and\r\nthere seems nothing abnormal about the varied vegetation.\r\nWhat would seem abnormal is the presence of high bracken at all in\r\nMarch. It may be noted however, that {a) the statement mentions bracken\r\nunder normal conditions (page 77, line 8) and {b) the statement uses the\r\nexpression \" bracken \", \" bramble \", \" scrub \" and \" ferns \" to describe\r\nthe vegetation. It may be therefore that the word \" bracken \" was used in a generic way to cover all such obstructions to progress. In 1947 all these\r\nplants were present as well as gorse, thorn and other bushes.\r\nLone Tree and Gate.\r\nThe statement says that a lone tree and gate were visible from the wall on\r\nthe Wednesday but on the Tuesday merely a mass of stunted trees could be\r\nseen at first and the lone tree and gate appeared as Mr Spence walked on. The ground rises steeply from Man Sands to the old wall and thence to the\r\ntriangulation point (shown as a small triangle on the Ordnance Map) on the\r\nshoulder of the hill and thereafter the ground rises more gently to the gate.\r\nThe gate is not visible from the old wall ; the shoulder of the hill inter- venes. On walking southward from the wall towards the gate the first objects to appear are several stunted, wind-driven trees on and below the\r\nedge of the cliff. Then the gate becomes apparent. On walking southwestward from the wall however the gate is clearly seen, owing to undulations in the surface of the ground, before the stunted trees come into view.\r\nConsidering that the land surface here undulates steeply in two directions so that it is confusing and most difficult to keep accurate account of movements or direction and considering that the statement was written eighteen\r\nmonths after the event, the account of the relative visibility of the gate and\r\nthe stunted trees is surprisingly accurate and it discloses nothing abnormal.\r\nOn one point alone does memory appear to be at fault. The statement\r\n128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nBased upon the Ordnance Survey Map, with the sanction of H.M. Stationery\r\nOffice. This map has been reduced in printing to J- linear, so that the scale as it appears on this page is 1\/7,500.\r\nDEC. 1947 A Case of Apparent Retrocognition ' 129\r\n(page 78, line 12) that the gate is visible from the place where the fall nearly\r\ntook place is not correct ; the shoulder of the hill intervenes.\r\nThe Wall.\r\nThe statement says that on the Tuesday and Thursday the wall seemed\r\nless ivy-covered but longer than it did on Wednesday.\r\nThe position and shape of the old wall are shown on the attached reproduction of part of the i \/2,500 Ordnance Map. On the reproduction, stone\r\nwalls are shown by heavy lines and hedges and wire fences are shown by\r\nlight lines. The apparent change of condition and length of the wall may possibly\r\nhave been due to the following two features, (i) part of the wall is ivycovered, particularly near the point where the fall nearly took place, and\r\npart is free from ivy, (2) the edge of the cliff is not well defined but progressively steepens and the vegetation makes it difficult to see where the steep\r\npart of the cliff begins and where the wall ends.\r\nThe photograph reproduced in Xht Journal is not of a piece of wall on the\r\nheadland, as the statement says, but is of the piece of wall where the fall nearly took place, though on the other side of it. The camera was pointing\r\nnorth ; in the far background may be seen the clifTs beyond Man Sands,\r\nand the headland itself appears in the near background.\r\nThe Giddiness.\r\nThe statement says that on the Thursday Mr Spence thought the wall\r\nextended for some way over grass and brambles and bracken to the edge of\r\nthe cliff but on taking a few paces forward he felt giddy and nearly fell over\r\nthe edge of the cliff. The dense vegetation makes it easy to approach the edge of the cliff near, the wall without realising the danger of falling until one is actually on a steep incline and this may perhaps be what actually occurred in 1938.\r\nConclusion.\r\nThe cumulative effect of these apparently abnormal features must have\r\nbeen impressive to the observer but it is difficult to say, on the information\r\navailable, that the experiences were so unusual as to preclude the possibility of normal explanations.\r\nRECENT CASES OF HAUNTINGS\r\nD. J. West\r\nExcept for the earlier volumes, the Proceedings and Journal contains comparatively few cases of hauntings. This is not through any lack of ghostly\r\nphenomena. Newspapers are always mentioning cases, particularly around\r\nChristmastime. The Society's files contain hundreds of reports, and their\r\nnumber is continually increasing.\r\nThere are definite reasons why so few haunting cases find their way into\r\nS.P.R. publications. In the first place, the Society is often consulted in an\r\nadvisory capacity about haunted houses, and is asked to keep the matter\r\n130 . , Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nconfidential. Owners of houses fear the value of their property may be\r\nlowered, and tenants fear legal action may be taken against them if they\r\ngive their place of residence a bad reputation.\r\nHaunting phenomena are mostly sporadic and lacking in clear-cut veridical features. For instance, the investigator may be told that on a certain\r\nday so and so saw an unexplained figure in a locality supposedly haunted.\r\nUsually it is impossible to establish any definite connection between the\r\nvision and facts about the locality which are unknown to the percipient.\r\nIn the absence of this criterion it is difficult to rule out normal causes. When the percipient is aware that the place has a reputation for haunting,\r\nhis experience may be the result of suggestion. Where this explanation is inapplicable, individual cases can always be explained away by reference to\r\nillusions, non-psychic hallucinations, or real persons mistaken for ghosts.\r\nSince the S.P.R. Journal normally quotes only those cases which present a reasonable \/)rt>Ka\/ac?e case for the supernormal, few haunting reports reach\r\npublication standard.\r\nAlthough these reasons are sound, it still seems a pity that nothing should\r\nbe heard about the many attempts at investigating haunts. Even though no definite conclusions can be reached, the facts concerning hauntings are by no means uninteresting. With the approval of the Hon. Editor, I am\r\nhere breaking with tradition by presenting a digest of illustrative cases taken from recent additions to the files. It must be stressed that these cases\r\nare not put forward as evidence for the supernormal, but merely as illustra- tions of typical haunting reports.\r\nG. 300.\r\nMR KANTOR'S EXPERIENCE\r\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for MarchApril 1947 contained an account by Mr MacKinlay Kantor, a well-known\r\nwriter, of a ghostly experience in a bedroom of a hostel for Americans in\r\nSouth Kensington, London. The story also appeared in the popular\r\nAmerican magazine Esquire.\r\nMr Kantor described how he visited the hostel at a time when everywhere was full with the exception of one small room on the second floor. The landlady seemed rather apologetic about it, and curiously reluctant\r\nto let him have the room. He thought it rather odd that the elderly folk\r\nwho tenanted the place should prefer to live in the third or fourth floor bedrooms when there was an identical room vacant on the second floor,\r\nwith much less stairs to climb to reach it. As Mr Kantor was settling down to sleep, he was disturbed by something\r\nwhich started to pull the bedclothes down towards the foot of the bed. He\r\ngripped the clothes tightly, but was still conscious of the pull, and as soon\r\nas he relaxed his grip the blankets started moving off again. After this, one of the walls of the room became intensely bright, with a whitish luminosity, which gradually increased in brilliancy as it decreased in size. As\r\nthis process went on, a jumble of voices became audible. With a determined effort Mr Kantor pulled the bedclothes over his head. The voices\r\nfaded and eventually he fell asleep. In the morning he thought the landlady gave him a long look as she asked him how he had slept.\r\nIt would be of great interest to know whether anyone else had had\r\nDEC. 1947 Recent Cases of Haunting\r\nsimilar impressions in the same room. The Editor of the American\r\nJournal very kindly supplied the real name and address of the hostel, and a member of the Society made inquiries.\r\nIt was found that the house had changed hands, and was now used to lodge the employees of a large industrial concern. The new manageress said\r\nthat the story of the haunted room was new to her, but she was interested in\r\nit, and readily identified the room from Mr Kantor's description. Although\r\nthis room was now continuously occupied, she had never heard of any\r\nunusual experiences connected with it. The Research Officer wrote to the manageress who was referred to by Mr Kantor. She replied that during the time she was there none of\r\nher guests reported anything out of the ordinary in the room.\r\nIt would seem that Mr Kantor's experience was a subjective one, and\r\nthat he was mistaken in supposing that other people thought there was\r\nsomething wrong with the room. G. 301.\r\nTHE LUTON GHOST\r\nIn October this year the newspapers were full ^ of the story of Mr Key, owner of Woodfield, Weathercock Lane, Woburn Sands, Bedfordshire,\r\nwho had appealed to the Luton Council's Assessment Committee for a reduction of his rates. One of the grounds of his appeal was that the house\r\nhad a reputation for haunting, which lowered its letting value. The case is quoted here as a typical example of what results are obtained from following\r\nup newspaper accounts of haunts.\r\nWoodfield is a fairly large house\u2014about eleven rooms\u2014said to be built on the remains of a 300-year old lodge. In his letters to the Assessment\r\nCommittee Mr Key quoted a legend said to be current in the village. The\r\nstory was that a one-time owner of the house discovered his daughter was\r\nconducting a secret love aff'air with a man of whom he disapproved. One\r\nnight he returned to the house unexpectedly, and finding the pair together,\r\nhe shut them both up in a cupboard and left them to die. Years later,\r\nDick Turpin, the famous highwayman, broke into the house and found the\r\nskeletons in the cupboard. As the price of his silence he demanded the use\r\nof the house as a hide-out. In return he helped remove the skeletons and\r\nbury them in a safer place.\r\nLittle evidence was supplied that the house was actually haunted. It had\r\nbeen occupied by Mr Key's sister until her death, four years previously.\r\nShe had not reported any ghost. Since then the sole occupant had been an\r\nelderly lady. Miss Amy Dickinson, who declared that she had never been\r\ntroubled by a ghost. The only person who could report any \" experience \"\r\nin the house was Miss Doreen Price, a young lady who was evacuated\r\nthere in 1944. Miss Dickinson made her a bed in the drawing-room.\r\nShe woke up in the night and saw hands and arms coming out from the wall\r\nabove her head. She fell asleep, but woke again and once more saw the\r\nhands and arms. She moved to another room and had no further uncanny\r\nexperiences.\r\n* Practically every British newspaper devoted some paragraphs to the case (including the Thnes and Netus of the World), and it also appeared in papers in S. Africa and Canada.\r\n132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nCouncillor H. W. M. Richards, a member of the Assessment Committee, was interested in psychic matters and decided to organise an investigation.\r\nHe contacted the Psychic News and arranged for one of their reporters and\r\nMrs Florence Thompson, a trance medium, to hold a seance in the haunted\r\nhouse.\r\nThe first seance took place on the night of Friday, Sept. 26th, 1947. The\r\nparty included, besides Mr Richards and various newspaper representatives, two local \" amateur investigators \" (Mr A. P. Underwood and MrBrown) and a friend of the medium's (Mr P. Craven). Mrs Thompson\r\nwent into trance and became controlled by what was said to be a distressed\r\nspirit. \" Let me go. Let me go. You are killing me. Don't shoot me.\"\r\nUnfortunately the voice was too incoherent to give any information, but\r\nwhen she came out of trance Mrs Thompson is reported to have said that\r\nshe got the impression of a\r\n\" tied up \" condition and that two lovers were\r\nconcerned.\r\nMr Richards, when questioned by the Research Officer a fortnight later,\r\nsaid that he was impressed by this result, since care was taken not to tell the\r\nmedium anything about the legend of the lovers until the seance was over. Mr Underwood, however, thought that the precautions taken were insuffi- cient to ensure that the medium knew nothing about it. In any case, the\r\nlegend was actually mentioned in the Luton News on Sept. 25th, that is to say before the day of the seance. The paper says : \" The legend is that two\r\nlovers were murdered there in the days of Dick Turpin.\" The medium's\r\nimpressions hardly went beyond this newspaper statement.\r\nA second seance, attended by the Research Officer, was held on Oct. i ith,\r\n1947. There were two medium's present, Mrs Florence Thompson and\r\nMr George Kenneth. By this time both of them were perfectly familiar\r\nwith the details of the legend, and discussed it freely with the company.\r\nThe sitting was held in dim red light. The mediums gave their impressions\r\nwhich included visions of an old man and of a black horse\u2014presumably the\r\nfamous Black Bess. Various members of the circle also reported visionary\r\nexp iriences, but there seemed to be no correlation between them. MrRichards, Mr Brown, the Research Officer and the newspaper reporters saw nothing. It will be seen that neither medium described anything which\r\ncould be verified, and that their impressions all conformed with a dubious\r\nlegend which, by its very nature, was most unlikely to be true. On Oct. 1 6th the Luton Assessment Committee met. Mr Richards\r\ndeclared himself satisfied on the evidence that the house was haunted. TheCommittee pointed, out that the investigations were not carried out at their\r\nrequest. They asked Mr Richards to retire while they came to a decision.\r\nMr Key's appeal was rejected.\r\nIn a case like this it is interesting to notice how ready some people are to assume without evidence a supernormal explanation, and how unwilling\r\nothers are even to consider such a possibility. The objective standpoint of\r\nthe psychical investigator seems foreign to the average individual.\r\nG. 302.\r\nTHE HAUNTING AT S. The centre of attraction in this case was a small cottage, some forty years\r\nold, situated at the end of a terraced row, in a quiet village of Southern\r\nDEC. 1947 Recent Cases of Haunting 133\r\nEngland, here called S. The Hon. Secretary and the Research Officer\r\nvisited S. on Nov. 3rd, 1946, at the suggestion of a local doctor who was\r\ninterested in the haunting.\r\nThe household consisted of Mr and Mrs T. (both about 60 years of age)\r\nand their recently \" demobbed \" son George, aged 24. There were three\r\nmarried daughters living elsewhere\u2014Violet, Margery and Sylvia. Violet,\r\nthe eldest, was about 34 years old. Mr T. was a housepainter, employed by a local firm. The ghost did not\r\ntrouble him because he was deSf and regularly slept through the noises.\r\nHowever, he looked thin and anxious, and gave a history of stomach pain\r\ndue to \" nerves \". Mrs T. seemed a rather hysterical type, highly preoccupied with her\r\nexperiences. Ghosts had followed her about all her life, even before she came to the present haunted house. By all accounts this was a family trait,\r\nfor according to George his maternal grandfather, Mr R., was a man who\r\nwas always looking for something supernatural. Mrs T. told one story\r\n(strongly suggestive of an hysterical reaction) in which she had had a vivid\r\ndream of being thumped on the back. In the morning she felt sore and was\r\ncovered in bruises.\r\nGeorge was not very robust to look at, and had a nervous manner, but he\r\ntalked intelligently about it all. He stated that during the war his unit was\r\nstationed at the famous poltergeist resort Borley Rectory\u2014but nothing\r\nhappened while he was there. George was supposed to have a fairygodfather apparition which appeared to him at moments of crisis. George's\r\nwife had recently left him, and Mrs T. thought that this marital trouble\r\nmight have some connection with the sudden increase in the phenomena\r\ncentred around George.\r\nOther members of the family had similar histories. Violet, when she was twelve years old, was wasting away and was advised to go to a sana- torium. Instead she went to stay with some spiritualists and attended a healing circle. Sylvia was said to have walked and talked in her sleep as a\r\nchild.\r\nSo much for the psychological background, not very good from the\r\ninvestigating standpoint, but perhaps all the better for the ghost.\r\nMr and Mrs T. had moved into the house 32 years ago. They knew the\r\nprevious occupant, but there was no suggestion that the place was haunted.\r\nMrs T. said she had always felt there was some sort of \" influence \" about\r\nthe place. Footsteps were heard in the passage at the side of the house\r\nwhen nobody was there. There were unaccountable noises in the yard.\r\nViolet used to complain when she was young that she could hear people\r\nwalking about on the roof. When she was ten she was terrified by seeing\r\na luminous vapour coming out of the dark lavatory closet. (It must be\r\nexplained that there was no electric light. Downstairs was supplied by gas, upstairs by candles.) One particular bedroom was specially associated with\r\nthe haunt. Mrs T.'s father, Mr R. (now dead), was said to have seen something when he slept there one night. He would never say what it was, but\r\nhe refused to sleep in the house again. Margery said she had seen a luminous cloud coming through the window of this room. Sylvia could not be\r\ninterviewed with her sisters because she was living in America, but she\r\nwrote to the Research Officer describing the footsteps in the passage and\r\n134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nother noises. She also said that she had just entered the haunted bedroom\r\none night when there was a most terrible noise. She screamed and\r\npanicked. To reassure her, her fiance, who was staying in the house,\r\nchanged bedrooms with her, but he saw and heard nothing unusual.\r\nAlthough there seem to have been a great many incidents of this kind,\r\nspread over the years, it would be profitless to pursue them. We have no means of knowing whether they were normal events, such as noises from\r\nnext door, lights from outside, disturbances by animals, etc., which were\r\nmisinterpreted owing to the nervous disposition and vivid imaginations of\r\nthe occupants. More significant were the recent happenings, which fol- lowed upon George's return from the Forces. They seemed to be getting\r\nsteadily worse. On the night of Oct. 20th, George was thoroughly unnerved when two candles, which he had in his bedroom while undressing, were repeatedly extinguished as if by the pinch of an unseen hand.\r\nThe night following, Mr K., a working man aged 26, slept with George\r\nto see if he too would meet the ghost. Just before ii.o p.m. they both\r\nheard a scratching near the window of the bedroom. George switched on a\r\ntorch, and both men saw that the cloth on a bedside table had been pulled,\r\nand some articles on the table displaced. A brush was hanging half over\r\nthe edge, and the cloth was seen to be still waving when the torchlight\r\nshone upon it. There was no cat in the house. The Research Officer\r\ninterviewed Mr K., who was a very down-to-earth type, but deeply\r\nimpressed by the ghostly experience.\r\nBy this time the family were becoming too frightened to sleep in the\r\nhouse, and formed the habit of staying with nearby relatives overnight.\r\nOn Oct. 30th, Mr J., a sceptical relative, accompanied by Mr W. senior and\r\nMr W. junior, decided to spend an all night vigil in the haunted bedroom.\r\nAt 1 1.45 p.m. they heard heavy footsteps approaching the back door (which was unlocked) and then there was a roaring sound as if someone had come\r\nin and lit the gas. Through the frosted glass panels in the door of the\r\nhaunted room, which overlooked the stairs, they saw a blue light which greW\r\nstronger, as if ascending the stairs. They opened the door, but immediately all was quiet and there was no light. They rushed downstairs with\r\ntheir torches on, but no one was about and they were sure no one could have\r\nhad time to escape. Mr J. and Mr W. senior were interviewed by the\r\nResearch Officer. Both were sensible witnesses, who appeared to have\r\nthought of most of the ordinary explanations, including a practical joke,\r\nbut without being able to account for their experience.\r\nMrs T. said that she also had heard footsteps approaching the back door\r\nat night, followed by a light coming up the stairs. Unfortunately Mrs T.\r\ndid not seem a reliable witness, and while her experiences were many and\r\nvaried, the Research Officer could find no evidence of her having described\r\nthis particular phenomenon before she heard Mr J's story.\r\nTwo nights later the landlord and some friends spent a night in the house,\r\nbut nothing happened. On Nov. 3rd the Research Officer spent a night\r\nthere with George\u2014the most haunted member of the family. In spite of\r\nMrs T's assurance that she could feel \" it's \" presence, and her reluctance\r\nto leave them alone at \" it's \" mercy, neither of them experienced anything\r\nthat night.\r\nLater, in November a group of leading spiritualists paid a visit to the\r\nDEC. 1947 Recent Cases of Haunting 135\r\ncottage, accompanied by a well-known trance medium. After the occupants had been questioned about their experiences, the medium went into\r\ntrance, and his guide explained that the disturbances were due to an elderly\r\nlady in spirit. She had once lived in the place and had been suffocated in\r\nthe haunted bedroom by a feather pillow. Her spirit still lingered because\r\nshe did not realise she was dead.\r\nMrs T. was very frightened at all this. Afterwards she also went into an\r\napparent trance, and said she was the spirit of Eileen Stanley of Waterlane\r\nand that her brother had been murdered in 1886 and his body buried under\r\nthe hearth. Waterlane was a place nearby where Mrs T. had lived as a girl.\r\n1886 was long before the cottage was built. George says he took up the\r\nfloorboards to try to find the body under the hearth, but without success. At the end of November a party of R.A.F. men had a night's watch in\r\nthe house. Only one of them encountered the ghost, he felt \" the Thing\r\ncoming up as if it were reaching out towards (him) and a peculiar but very\r\npowerful sensation spread over (his) chest and arms \". On Dec. 14th, 1946, Dr A. J. B. Robertson and a medical student stayed\r\nthere for a night, but without any experience. Dr Robertson reported : \" The only new phenomena of note reported was a supposed ghostly strangling of George when upstairs followed by him being pushed downstairs,\r\nwhere he was caught by (Mr J.). Actually the matter, I think, reduces to George passing out on top of the stairs and falling back down them. Hewas revived in a few minutes.\"\r\nFinally the T. family left the house altogether, having been told by the\r\nlocal authorities that it would be requisitioned if they continued sleeping\r\nelsewhere. On Sept. 25th, 1947, a year later, a letter was received from the\r\nnew tenant saying : \" I am now the occupier of this house, and have been for the past four\r\nmonths, during which time neither I nor my wife have either seen or heard\r\nanything unusual.\"\r\nWhatever view one takes of the nature of the happenings in this so-called\r\nhaunted house, it is clear that in this case, as in many others, the causes are bound up with the personal psychology of the family concerned, rather\r\nthan with the house itself. In ten old cases of haunted houses followed up\r\nrecently by the Research Officer, not one survived a change of occupant.\r\nAnother point brought out by this case is the unreliability of mediumistic impressions in connection with haunted houses. In both this and the\r\npreceding case a medium was called in, but it is very doubtful if the people were made any the wiser for it. G. 303. \" \u2022 . THE HAUNTING OF R GRANGE\r\nThe following report, sent to us in September, 1947, comes from Mr A.\r\nJ. Sharp of the Durham University S.P.R.\r\nR is a village in Wharfedale on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors.\r\nThe Grange is a solidly built stone house dating to about 1500. The\r\npresent porch bears the date 1672 but the original doorway which can still be seen is considered to be much older. Among remarkable features of the\r\nhouse are two hanging stones on the gable end and numerous devices\r\nchiselled on the stones and above the windows as a protection against\r\n136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research DEC. 1947\r\nwitches. The house is now divided into two, the larger part which includes\r\nthe porch being owned by Mr L , and the smaller part by Mr F . In the larger part, the ground floor consists of a living-room from which\r\na kitchen passage and staircase lead off. The passage leading to the back\r\ndoor (the porch is at present bricked off) also gives access to two store rooms beyond, one of which is a large empty room containing the cellar staircase and having a connecting door with the living-room. The upper\r\nfloor has a landing leading to two bedrooms, a bathroom and a large sittingroom (formerly a bedroom) which leads to a small bedroom above\"' the\r\nporch. This has been dubbed the haunted room, though the reason seems\r\nobscure. The cellars are peculiar. The staircase leads into the larger of\r\ntwo, the walls being fitted with stone wine bins and illumination formerly\r\nprovided by a window below ground level opening onto a path which is now flagged over. There is also a small well now little more than a sump.\r\nThe smaller cellar also has a window leading onto a short earth-walled\r\npassage and coming up in the front garden.\r\nThe statements of Mr and Mrs L . Mr and Mrs L with their son and two daughters, then very young,\r\nmoved into the house in September, 1938. Their neighbour then, a Mrs\r\nR , warned them that the place was certainly haunted. The first floor sitting-room was then used as a bedroom and seemed to form the centre of\r\nactivity. Frequently during the night a shufiiing sound would be heard\r\napproaching the door, then a noise which Mrs L described as like a great heap of clothes falling from the door onto the floor inside the bed- room. On investigation nothing was ever seen to account for the sounds.\r\nThe door of the haunted room, which I am satisfied can be securely latched\r\nwithout danger of springing open, was frequently opened during the night.\r\nOne of the most unusual phenomena was the sound of footsteps within the\r\nbedroom, accompanied by the springing up and down of the floorboards,\r\nwhich would be produced by someone walking across them (they are a narrow variety easily depressed).\r\nThese phenomena ceased in July, 1942, (when the room was vacated\r\nas a bedroom), with the exception of the unlatching of the door which\r\nhas occurred in recent months. The haunted room now being occupied by\r\nthe eldest daughter.\r\nA frequent occurrence was the appearance of smoke issuing from the\r\nceiling, but this was discovered to be due to a leakage in one of the flues. A pecuHar incident happened in September, ,,1939 (September seems to have been the period when phenomena were at their best). Mrs L\r\nwas alone in the living-room, and her eldest daughter sleeping upstairs,\r\nthe handle of the door leading to the cellar turned and the door opened.\r\nA moment later it closed, reopened, and closed again. There was a violent\r\nnoise on the outer door and the latch of the passage door lifted, the door\r\nswinging open. At this Mrs L fled upstairs quite terrified and woke\r\nher daughter. Together they searched the house but everything seemed\r\nnormal.\r\nThis statement I collected on my first visit on July, 24th 1947, but having\r\nonly an evening at my disposal I did not interview the F s until my\r\nsecond visit on August 7th.\r\nDEC. 1947 Recent Cases of Haunting 137\r\nThey had been in residence only a short time and had experienced\r\nnothing. The arrangement of this part of the house is therefore irrelevant.\r\nThe history of the house is again of little importance though it is once supposed to have been a nunnery and there are tales in the village of\r\nencounters with a \" white lady \" though no one will swear to have seen her.\r\nI communicated with Mrs R , who now lives in the south of England,\r\nand she sent me a statement from which I again take extracts.\r\nStatement of Mrs R . The one experience which could not be explained occurred on August\r\nBank Holiday of 1928 (or 9). The noise which sounded like the swishing of\r\nclothes was heard by both Mr and Mrs R who got up and made a\r\nsearch, finding nothing. Nothing more was thought about the incident\r\nuntil an old resident asked if they had never seen anything. On being\r\nasked what, he said that a woman was supposed to walk the yard from the\r\nbarn. An old tale with which Mrs R became acquainted was that a\r\nface could be seen at the round window above the porch if looked for by\r\nanyone standing at the end of the drive. Mrs R 's sister who, on one\r\noccasion, slept several nights in the room over the porch vowed that her\r\ndoor was opened every night after she had gone to sleep.\r\nIn further correspondence Mr Sharp remarked : \" Regrettably enough the phenomena are clearly past their best. . . . The unlatching of the door is the only incident which has happened for\r\nseveral weeks. . . . An all night vigil ... I hardly thought worth while . . . The case might have been a classic if only someone had kept a diary.\"\r\nThe report is perhaps the most typical of the cases quoted. It illustrates the infrequent and vague nature of the phenomena, which always seem to elude the investigator's grasp. There are literally hundreds of cases just\r\nlike it. G. 304.\r\nA POLTERGEIST AT AN INN\r\nTo complete this little round of cases, here is a poltergeist. The opening\r\nletter came from a neighbour, and read as follows :\r\nJune 1 6th, 1947.\r\nDear Sir,\r\nI am writing to inform you of what I consider to be genuine poltergeist phenomena at an inn in this town.\r\nThere are all the usual symptoms, including drawers being turned out on\r\nthe floor, things being moved from place to place or lost, saucepans flung\r\nfrom a dresser and so on.\r\nI feel certain of the honesty of the people concerned, who have called in\r\nthe police, being obviously ignorant of the real cause. ... The Research Officer visited the inn on June 28th, 1947. The family\r\nconsisted of Mr and Mrs E., in late middle age, and a son aged 16, who\r\nlooked younger. According to neighbours, this boy was \" highly strung\r\n\" and \" not quite normal \". There was also a married daughter, but she did\r\nnot live in the house.\r\nFor the past month a supposed poltergeist had ransacked the bedrooms\r\n138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nseveral times a week. Clothes were thrown about, the contents of drawers\r\nscattered, rugs turned upside down, etc., etc. These disturbances went on\r\nduring the day at times when the bedrooms were unoccupied.\r\nOn arrival, the Research Officer was shown upstairs where one of the rooms had been preserved for his inspection in a state of chaos from the\r\nprevious day's activity. The wardrobe was open, clothes hangers un- hooked and clothes scattered about the floor. Drawers were open and loose\r\narticles from them and from around the room, including floor coverings, were all awry. The total efi\"ect was as if someone had rushed round the\r\nroom grabbing everything they could lay hands on in a deliberate attempt\r\nto disarrange everything without doing any real harm.\r\nClose questioning of members of the family revealed the following\r\ninteresting facts :\r\n(1) The whole family pleaded ignorance of poltergeist cases, having\r\nnever read or talked about such matters before the present outbreak.\r\n(2) Nothing was ever damaged by the poltergeist.\r\n(3) The boy was the only person to claim to have seen the phenomena in\r\nprogress, the other people in the house saw only the after-effects. He told\r\nthe Research Officer that only the day before he had gone into his room and\r\nthe wardrobe had opened of its own accord and the contents had flown out\r\nin his face.\r\n(4) The parents thought that the phenomena could not be the boy playing pranks, because once or twice they had occurred at times when he could\r\nnot have been responsible for them. However, further questioning showed\r\nthat there was no real basis for this belief.\r\n(5) Mrs E. was worried both by the happenings and by the suspicion\r\nattaching to her son. Mr E. did not seem to mind, he remarked that it was\r\ngood for trade. The boy was said to be terrified by it all, but he obviously\r\nenjoyed telling his experiences.\r\nThe Research Officer suggested locking the bedrooms during the day by\r\nway of experiment. This was agreed to, but was never carried out. After\r\nhis visit, the phenomena seemed to fade away and nothing has happened\r\nsince.\r\nThere are scores of cases just like this\u2014a peculiar boy or girl in the house,\r\nwith every indication that he or she is the source of the supposed \" phenomena \".^ A very similar case, in which the central figure was a little\r\ngirl, was investigated in March, 1947. The \" phenomena \" consisted of\r\nnoises at night around the little girl's bed. The parents naively ex- plained that they were more forcible in the dark. The child was an impish,\r\nprecocious creature, who probably produced the noises with her feet on\r\nthe bed-rail. The phenomena disappeared with the arrival of the investigators, and so far as is known have not recurred.\r\nThe interesting points about these cases are not so much how the phenomena are produced\u2014which is usually only too obvious, but why they should occur at all and why they should always indulge in noises and throwing\r\nthings about. Possibly discontent, boredom or frustrated urges provide\r\nthe initial stimulus, and newspaper stories or sheer animal spirits guide the\r\npattern of the \" phenomena \".\r\n* In 1935, a shop in the same small town was the centre of similar disturbances,\r\nalso apparently connected with the presence of a boy.\r\nDEC. 1947 Correspondence 139\r\nCORRESPONDENCE . To the Editor of the Journal.\r\nSir,\u2014In recent letters to the Journal Mrs Heywood has suggested that\r\nwe should pay more attention to those less well corroborated cases of\r\npurported psi in the belief that such an approach would further aid the\r\nelucidation of the various factors involved.\r\nSuch an attitude is surely unwise. As a Society we have obligations to science as a whole ; and if one of the aims of the S.P.R. is to convince the\r\nscientific world of the validity and importance of our subject, it is essential\r\nto adhere to scientific standards. It is to be regretted that many of the cases reported in the Journal fall far short of this requirement. If it is the\r\nSociety's policy to be less than scientific then it would be advisable to acknowledge it openly.\r\nAssuming, however, that such is not the case, to put in evidence the\r\ncharacter of the percipient as Mrs Heywood has suggested, is, basically, an unsound principle to work on. If the evidence so far collected lacks full conviction it is very largely on account of this tendency to include in our\r\npublications cases not up to the requisite standards of evidence. Unfortunately we cannot assess personal integrity by scientific methods. And even\r\nsupposing that we could, owing to the subjective nature of the subject,\r\npersonal integrity is no guarantee of accuracy in a psychical narrative.\r\nMrs Heywood asks : \" How much of what evidence would . . . eliminate\r\nchance coincidence and our other bogies ... ? \" This question is symptomatic of the tendency towards muddled thinking into which too many have\r\nfallen in the past. What we need are thoroughly authenticated cases for which\r\nan explanation by chance coincidence, or any other normal means, would\r\nbe a logical improbability. Mrs Heywood's question lacks relevance as it stands and is virtually unanswerable.\r\nIt is only by studying and analysing material of whose validity we are not\r\nin doubt that we shall be encouraged to work out a sound theoretical\r\nbasis of which psychical research is so much in need. And without some\r\nkind of general induction of this nature we shall add little to knowledge of\r\nthe conditions which govern the occurrence of psi.\r\nThe fact is that psychical research already suffers enough from drawbacks which are absent in other sciences ; the inability to reproduce exact\r\nexperimental conditions, the lack of a proven working hypothesis, the necessity of largely relying on the evidence of untrained observers\u2014to relax the\r\nstandards of evidence in apparent cases of psi phenomena in addition to the\r\nabove, is to abandon all pretence of scientific aim and method.\r\nThere are a number of people who are convinced that psi phenomena are not amenable to scientific method. From among these Mrs Heywood will draw a large measure of support. This attitude I believe to be a cardinal\r\nerror, and in a new treatise now in preparation I aim to demonstrate this\r\nbeyond further argument. In the conviction that one day psychical re- search will rank among the accepted branches of science I must deplore\r\nMrs Heywood's attitude as short-sighted and deleterious to the Society's\r\nbest interests. - v . Yours etc., D. H. Rawclifee.\r\n140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nSir,\u2014I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Mr Rawcliffe's letter,\r\nthough I have little to add to my previous enquiries, which were made\r\nsimply in the hope of clearing up an apparently illogical situation. The\r\nattitude that the facts have not as yet proved E.S.P. is intelligible ; so is the\r\nattitude that they have. What seems odd is the attitude that, while accepting E.S.P., spontaneous cases of it must still be assessed on the presupposition that it is not only non-proven, but so inherently impossible that the\r\nassumption that the reports of many reliable (on other subjects) percipients\r\nmay be founded on fact is inadmissable ; they must be ignored.\r\nThe news of Mr RawcliflFe's forthcoming, clarifying treatise is welcome,\r\nbut may I humbly protest against his assumption that I do not think E.S.P.\r\nin any way amenable to scientific experiment. In the light of Dr Rhine's\r\nand Dr Soal's experiments alone, this would be absurd. But can the living\r\nbeing give up all its secrets in the laboratory or the information gained by\r\nthe methods of the physical sciences applied to biological phenomena be more than partial ? Is it possible, for example, to vary one factor only\r\nwhen studying a living cell, far less when the subject is a complicated rela- tionship between two elaborate human beings ?\r\nI heartily agree that we want more and more authenticated cases which\r\ncannot be explained by chance coincidence. But to-day all simple cases seem to fall under this ban and nature is reluctant to supply complicated ones in quantity. Must we then do no more than rest in the hope that one day cases of psi will be so common that, as with the equally subjective\r\nphenomena of dreams, we shall dare to assume their existence ? Yours etc., Rosalind Heywood.\r\nSir,\u2014I agree strongly with Mrs Heywood about the necessity for stating a\r\ndefinite standard to which it would be necessary to attain to prove, beyond\r\nany doubt, that E.S.P. exists. The lack of any clear idea about this has\r\nbeen a source of great confusion and inefficiency in psychical research.\r\nExperimenters have had to formulate their own standards and, in the\r\nabsence of adequate discussion, have sometimes fixed them at unreasonably\r\nsevere or lenient levels. Some, even, have simply not considered the\r\nmatter, and have collected \" evidence \" in a fit of blind acquisitiveness,\r\nwithout any idea of what sort of evidence is needed. I suggest that this\r\nlack is a partial explanation of the wide differences of opinion as to the interpretation of evidence which have sometimes led to dark suspicions that the\r\nopponents' views were better considered as psychological curiosities than as opinions to be treated seriously.\r\nDuring the last 65 years an enormous amount of energy has been ex- pended on psychical research. Yet, despite this industrious and admirable\r\nactivity, E.S.P. (to say nothing of other phenomena of psychical research)\r\nremains, in the eyes of many investigators, unproved. Faced with this\r\nremarkable fact it is not surprising that many people should feel, as Mrs\r\nHeywood evidently feels, that these investigators are perhaps unreasonably\r\nprejudiced, that, in trying to satisfy them, the Society is pouring its work\r\ndown a bottomless well, and that whatever the evidence produced it will never be enough to convince the sceptics. Yet such an attitude, though\r\nnatural at a first glance at the facts, cannot be sustained against criticism ;\r\nDEC. 1947 Correspondence 141\r\nfor there are definite standards which would satisfy the sceptical as to the\r\nexistence of E.S.P., and many who are familiar with all the Society's work\r\nare convinced that these standards have never yet been reached. Moreover\r\nthe standards, though severe, are not impractically severe, and it is not\r\naltogether surprising that the sceptic finds his scepticism increasing when\r\nhe considers that, despite the enormous quantity of the evidence there is\r\nstill, after 65 years, considerable doubt as to whether they have been\r\nattained.\r\nThe evidence which I would tentatively suggest as sufficient to convince\r\nany reasonable person of the existence of E.S.P. is as follows : Expermental Evidence.\r\n1. All means of normal communication, however indirect, between the\r\npercipient and any person (e.g. agent, observer, etc.) who knows the target,\r\nand any means of normal perception or deduction of the target by the percipient must be rigidly excluded until after the guess is made.\r\n2. As soon as such normal communication, perception, or deduction is made possible, all means of alteration of the recorded targets or guesses\r\nmust be rigidly excluded at least until the guesses have been scored and\r\nchecked in the presence of at least one independent observer.\r\n3. The experiments must show success in the presence of several independent observers. Within reason, a request to be permitted to attend an experiment as observer must not be refused.\r\n4. The results must be estimated by a reliable statistical method and\r\nshould give antichance odds greater than a million to one.\r\n5. Fraud or error, conscious or unconscious, may be excluded in two\r\nways only :\r\n{a) by physical impossibility.\r\n(b) by repetition of the experiment according to the following rules : If there is a physically possible normal explanation involving fraud\r\nor error on the part of one experimenter, the experiment must be\r\nrepeatable by (almost) any experimenter at will. If at least two\r\nexperimenters would have to be involved in such fraud or error, the\r\nexperiment must be repeated by two further independent sets of\r\nexperimenters. '\r\n. 6. All relevant details must be reported.\r\nThese are not completely rigid standards. If, say, there were collateral evidence throwing doubt on the reliability of the experimenters, they might\r\nbe inadequate. It is not necessary to describe how these standards can in\r\npractice be attained : the experiments of Soal and Goldney exemplify the\r\ntype of technique that must be used. It is solely because these experiments stand alone as an isolated piece of work as yet unrepeated by other\r\nexperimenters that I do not consider it unreasonable to refuse to accept\r\nthem as entirely conclusive proof of E.S.P. (see 5\r\n{b) above).\r\nSpontaneous Evidence.\r\nI . All means of normal perception or deduction by the percipient of the\r\nfact or event perceived and all means of normal communication of the fact or event to the percipient must be impossible until the percipient's observation has been recorded and placed in the Society's files. (Other reliable\r\n142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nhands would be permissible, e.g. a bank or Post Office safe, provided one\r\ncould be sure that the case would be reported even if the result was negative.)\r\n2. Any possibility of the percipient himself causing the observed fact or event to occur must be excluded.\r\n3. The coincidence must remain striking even after allowance has been\r\nmade for selection of the experience from similar experiences both of the same percipient and of other percipients.\r\n4. At least three such cases must be on record.\r\n5. All relevant details must be reported.\r\nIt is recognised that condition i (Spontaneous Cases) is in normal cases not easy to satisfy ; but in precognitive cases the requirement is surely very\r\nreasonable, and might well be expected to have been fulfilled by now (with\r\n2, 3 and 5) at least once in the Society's experience.\r\nIn conclusion, may I insist that, however unreasonable the sceptic may\r\nappear to some, he is not usually in reality the utter and immoveable\r\ndiehard he may seem. Good evidence he will accept : the standards\r\nare definite, he is only waiting for them to be reached. Now that telepathy\r\nhas become an everyday word and books on E.S.P. are on sale in every book\r\nshop it is easy to forget that we are concerned with a phenomenon which\r\nseems to contradict utterly the very bases of a system of knowledge that has\r\nbeen checked and rechecked a thousand times in a thousand different ways\r\nand never, outside the rare and dubious phenomena of our subject, been\r\nfound wanting. Is it unreasonable to ask for sound evidence ?\r\n, Yours faithfully,\r\n\u2022 J. D. Proctor\r\nSir,\u2014Since writing to you I have read with great appreciation Mr Proctor's open-minded and constructive letter. Of course the sceptic has the\r\nright to consider the evidence for E.S.P. inadequate, but Mr Proctor has\r\ncaused me tentatively to wonder whether the sceptic's grounds are entirely\r\nlogical. He says that E.S.P. contradicts the bases of a system of knowledge\r\nwhich has been checked and rechecked. But, ultimately, are causality and\r\nthe uniformity of nature more than assumptions : are we sure that this\r\nsystem is more than a description of the relatedness of our sensory perceptions ? And is not the system itself behaving in a very peculiar manner }\r\nIt is a far cry from Dr Johnson's stone to Eddington's statements that\r\nelementary particles of physics are not objective units and that \" it is pertinent to remember that the concept of substance has disappeared from\r\nfundamental physics \". If we cannot fit extra sensory perception into the\r\nframe of thought moulded by sensory perception should we perhaps consider the possible limitations of the frame\r\nMany of us have accepted the experimental evidence for E.S.P. on the\r\nauthority of Professors Broad and Price, Dr Thouless, and others, not\r\nhaving the technical knowledge to assess it ourselves. But I think it the\r\nduty of some of us occasionally to have the courage to state that we have a bias in its favour, created by personal experiences, which make it as great a mental acrobatic feat for us to deny E.S.P. as for others without those\r\nexperiences to accept it. I have listed six of my immediate family and seven\r\nDEC. 1947 Correspondence 143\r\nclose friends whose repeated experiences tally so closely with my own that\r\nwe can talk about them intelligibly to one another. In some cases they were\r\nacted upon and corroborated to our satisfaction, for we accepted the integrity of the corroborator, but they are of course quite unevidential to others\r\nif corroborators are always suspect. (It is sobering to think of the quantity\r\nof evidence for hoaxing, collusion, misrepresentation and so forth which\r\nmay be contained in the records of the S.P.R.)\r\nI get the impression that the sceptic feels that the integrity and competence of the investigator into E.S.P. must be doubted to an extent greater\r\nthan if the same investigator were tackling another subject. But even so, can we ever get away from assumptions of integrity ? In \" Thoughts\r\nThrough Space \" it is recorded that Sir Hubert Wilkins' percipient posted\r\nhis remarkable, apparently telepathic impressions to three eminent men,\r\nthe same evening they were received, Sir Hubert being somewhere round\r\nthe North Pole at the time. But the postmark will have been on the envelope, not the report, so the sceptic must presumably consider that the three\r\neminent men agreed to substitute later another report, based on Sir\r\nHubert's own diary, rather than that telepathy occurred. Dare we assume\r\nthat the officers of the S.P.R. would not do the same And on this grave\r\nnote of doubt may I, Sir, finally retire from this correspondence ? Yours etc., Rosalind Heywood.\r\nSir,\u2014Since the publication in the May, 1947, issue of Xhe^ Journal oixht case of \" Margaret Foote \" received through Geraldine Cummins, further\r\nvaluable corroboration has come to hand. It will be recalled that, at the\r\ntime of writing, Mr \" Donald X.\" was unable to verify that the second name\r\nof the alleged communicator was Alice (page 42). Moreover, he was informed by an old friend of \" Marguerite's \" that she did not die as stated by\r\nAstor, in Kensington, N.Z. but in a neighbouring district. On July 31st, 1947, \" Mr X \" wrote : \" Tell Geraldine that I have found\r\nout that \" Marguerite Foote \" did die in Kensington, N.Z.\u2014the Kensington Marine Hospital it was, but in Kensington. Also, her middle name\r\nwas Alice which I did not know and at first could not verify. ...\"\r\nIn this case, the memory of the alleged communicator was more accurate\r\nthan that of an intimate friend still in the flesh. Yours faithfully, E. B. GiBBES\r\nP.S. May I take this opportunity of correcting a small error which crept\r\ninto the account published in the Journal, page 34. In the letter from\r\nMr \" X \" it is stated that \" Marguerite \" lived in Kensington, N.Z.\r\nwhereas, the word should have been died there.\r\nSir,\u2014I noticed recently that in some of my dreams (which I am in the\r\nhabit of recording) my second name, Francis, is used, the context in each\r\ncase making it clear that the reference is to myself.\r\nIn the \" A.G.P.\" multiple personality case, reported by T. W. Mitchell\r\n{Proc. XXVI), the second name, Geraldine, was \" forgotten \" by the\r\n144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec. 1947\r\nprimary personality, and also by the secondary, \" Amelia,\" but remembered by the tertiary \" Amelia Geraldine \". Writing in the Journal, Miss H. A. Dallas (July, 1929, and Nov., 1932)\r\nand the Baroness de Kerkucs (Jan., 1933) both refer to cases in which\r\nmediums have described persons (otherwise clearly identified) by their\r\nsecond names.\r\nAll this seems to indicate that the second name, little used in ordinary\r\nlife, is sometimes appropriated by the subconscious mind. In the mediumistic cases, this slightly strengthens the hypothesis of telepathy (which, as\r\nis generally agreed, takes place between subconscious and subconscious) as against chance coincidence of names, on the one hand, and, on the other, a spirit-message from anything corresponding to the conscious mind of a living person.\r\nHowever, the evidence is scanty. I should be very glad to hear of any\r\nother cases known to your readers.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n. G. F. Dalton\r\nOBITUARY NOTICE\r\nAs we go to press we learn with deepest regret of the sudden death on December 13th of Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S., President of the Society, 1937-\r\n1938 and a generous donor to our funds.

I, on Tuesday, 25 November 1947, at 3 p.m. The President,\r\nMr W. H. Salter, in the Chair. The Minutes of the last Meeting of the\r\nCouncil were read and signed as correct. Thirty new Members and two\r\nStudent-Associates were elected ; their names and addresses are given\r\nabove.\r\nThe 432nd Meeting of the Council was held at 31 Tavistock Square London, W.C. I, on Wednesday, 17 December 1947, at 5 p.m. The President,\r\nMr W. H. Salter, in the Chair. The Minutes of the last Meeting of the\r\nCouncil were read and signed as correct. Twelve new Members were\r\nelected ; their names and addresses are given above.\r\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1947\r\n1 . The Council are again gratified to record a large increase in the membership of the Society. The number of new Members (166) and StudentAssociates (9) is much the largest for many years.\r\n2. On the completion of his first year of work as Research Officer, the\r\nCouncil confirmed Dr West in that position. He reports as follows : The year has been more notable for the number of explorations carried\r\nout, than for the wealth of positive results. As explained in an appeal to members in the Journal for Oct. -Nov. 1946, the great barrier to research\r\nat present is the scarcity of good material for investigation, a difficulty from\r\nwhich it is believed other societies engaged in psychical investigation are\r\nalso suffering.\r\nE.S.P. experiments, both qualitive and quantitative, have been pursued\r\nsteadily throughout the year. The results of some of these experiments\r\nhave been summarised in the Oct. -Nov. Journal, and more have been\r\ncompleted since. The majority of the experiments have been carried out\r\nwith persons professing ability in the particular direction tested, but so far\r\n148 ' Journal of Society for Psychical Resem-ch JAN. 1948\r\nonly one individual has shown any promise. This person does not appear\r\nto be successful with cards, but is apparently able to locate a small object\r\nplaced inside one of a number of similar closed boxes. Further tests are in\r\nprogress, and are showing great promise.\r\nA small series of E.S.P. tests has been carried out on subjects in the\r\nhypnotic trance. So far as they go, these tests seem to confirm the theory\r\nthat psi faculties cannot be made to manifest by hypnosis if they are not\r\ndemonstrable when the subject is in a normal condition.\r\nThe mass telepathy tests with drawings, completed early in the year, were reported in the Journal for May. The results were entirely null. Recently, some of these drawings were divided\u2014in a rough and preliminary manner\u2014into categories of bold, expansive drawings and niggling\r\ncompressive types. The preliminary experiment tended to give some slight\r\nconfirmation of the Duke University experimenters' claims that expansive\r\nand compressive drawings score significantly differently. The question\r\nis being investigated further, and the services of an independent judge have\r\nbeen secured who will score the drawings from a psychological point of\r\nview. With the death of Mr Whately Carington, the original drawings from\r\nall his experiments have been deposited with the Society by Mrs Carington.\r\nIf this line of investigation continues promising, we shall have ample\r\nmaterial to work on. Very recently the Duke University experimenters have introduced a new\r\nmethod of assessing displacement,^ measuring the consistency of the direction [i.e. +1 or - i) of the greater displacement in the run. This test,\r\napplied to recent E.S.P. scores from S.P.R. experiments produced null\r\nresults. There is little to report of positive interest in connection with mental\r\nmediums. Enquiry in several quarters shows that there is at present a very\r\nexceptional scarcity of good mediums. Various clairvoyant and trance\r\nmediums have either come to the Society's rooms, or been visited by its representatives, but without any striking results. Assessment of the work\r\nof these mediums is made difficult by the vagueness of their statements.\r\nThis has been especially noticeable when proxy sittings have been attempted\r\nand the mediums have not had the guidance of the age, sex and general\r\nappearance of the sitter. Psychometry experiments, begun with Mr Mayes in 1946, have been\r\ncontinued throughout the year, and some fifteen mediums have been tested.\r\nAlthough no evidence of veridical psychic impressions has so far been\r\nobtained in these experiments, they have been most useful and instructive\r\nin other ways, particularly in bringing into sharp relief the many problems\r\nconnected with annotating and assessing sittings. Mainly through the\r\neffctfts of Mr M. T. Hindson, there has been prepared a catalogue of\r\nmediumistic statements in which the items are classified according to\r\ntopics, e.g. description of character, descriptions of personal appearance,\r\netc. This catalogue will be made use of in the assessment of future proxy\r\nsittings.\r\nThe main developments in connection with physical mediums have been\r\nthe acquisition of an infra-red image convertor (which enables the investiSee Dr. Thouless's review of The Journal of Parapsychology for Sept. 1947,\r\nwhich appears later in this issue.\r\nJAN. 1948 Annual Report of the Council 149\r\ngator to watch the activities of a medium at a dark seance), and the offer\r\nby a group of interested S.P.R. members\u2014of a prize of ^^250 for a demonstration of genuine physical phenomena. No physical phenomena have\r\nbeen produced in response to this offer, which closed on December 31. A\r\nreport on the matter will appear in the Journal.\r\nMany interesting spontaneous cases have been investigated during the\r\nyear. A few of these have been reported in Xht Journal, and the December\r\nnumber contained reports of some recent hauntings. It is of course\r\nimpossible to give full reports of all the investigations, but detailed records\r\nare kept in the Research files and can be consulted by any member on\r\napplication.\r\nDuring the year the Society secured the cooperation of Mass Observation, the well-known organisation which specialises in the collection of\r\nvital statistics. In November, a questionnaire was posted to 1500 people,\r\nmembers of a panel of voluntary helpers from this organisation, which \u2022 asked for details of any personal experiences of a psychic nature. The\r\nquestion which headed the form was the same as the question which was\r\nasked in the Census of Hallucinations carried out by the Society in its early\r\nyears. (See Proceedings, Vol. X). The response has been most gratifying,\r\nand a more detailed report will appear in due course.'\r\nIt had been hoped, [vide last Annual Report), to investigate thoroughly\r\nthe alleged powers of Mr Harry Edwards, the well-known psychic healer.\r\nThe Research Officer suggested that arrangements should be made for \" a doctor on the spot to examine the patients \". This suggestion was declined\r\nby Mr Edwards, who wrote : \" In my opinion it would be necessary to have several groups under close\r\nobservation so that the findings of the groups could be compared. Myreason for this is that, like investigations into physical phenomena, no one group will accept the evidence of another but wish to make their particular\r\ntests. This difficulty will be more so with psychic healings, and will need the\r\ncooperation of specialists in the class of disease investigated. ... For example, if we could get the staffs of hospitals specialising in a stated\r\ndisease-family to submit a number of their cases and observe results. This\r\ncould be taken with several hospitals ...\"\r\nAs the facilities required by Mr Edwards, although admirable in themselves, went far beyond what was available to the Society (or, for that matter,\r\nbeyond what is available to the majority of medical research workers), it had to be pointed out to Mr Edwards that we were unable to comply with\r\nthese requirements, and investigation was discontinued. The British\r\nMedical Association, which was informed of the position, did not consider\r\nit proper to take any official notice of the matter, and thought that MrEdwards should be left to his own devices.\r\nOf five patients who were under our supervision while being treated by \u2022 Mr Edwards, no one showed any improvement.\r\nAt those of his demonstrations attended by the Research Officer or other\r\nS.P.R. representatives nothing suggestive of a paranormal effect occurred.\r\nAttempts to follow up some of the accounts of \" miracle \" cures which\r\noften appear in the psychic press have likewise produced no real evidence\r\nfor the paranormal. Details are on record in the files.\r\n150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN. 1948\r\nWhile for the moment there is a regrettable dearth of positive results to report, general interest in psychical research seems to be everywhere\r\nincreasing, and the enthusiasm shown by members of the Society is a great\r\nencouragement. As workers multiply and our contacts expand, so we may\r\nlook forward to a proportionate rise in interesting results.\r\n3. Other pieces of research carried out by members include the following : Dr Soal and his group have continued their experiments with Mrs\r\nGloria Stewart of Richmond. A preliminary report of some of the results\r\nobtained will appear in his Myers Memorial Lecture, shortly to be published.\r\nThe Council has printed a leaflet. Hints on Sitting with Mediums, which\r\nis available to interested members on application.\r\nDr Soal has compiled a note on the procedure advisable in experimental\r\ntelepathy, of which some copies have been multigraphed and can be\r\nborrowed by members intending, as it is hoped many will, to engage in\r\nthis form of research.\r\nThe Cambridge University Psychical Research Society, a report of whose\r\nactivities appeared in the Journal for October-November, is continuing\r\nwith an ambitious programme of research. A preliminary series of tele- pathy tests using drawings has just been completed. They were longdistance postal experiments carried out between Cambridge and a group of\r\npercipients under the direction of Dr Tanagra, working in Athens. Other\r\nrecent work includes some \" single trial \" experiments, designed to take\r\nmaximum advantage of the comparatively high degree of success that seems often to be associated with the very beginning of a series of card\r\nguesses.\r\nAlso doing active work is a Psychical Research Society at King's College,\r\nDurham. Two cases of haunting investigated by this group have been\r\nreported in the Journal during the year, and we look forward to further\r\ncontributions.\r\n4. Publicity. The second issue of the Pamphlet descriptive of the\r\nSociety's work, and originally printed in 1945, having been exhausted, a further 2,500 copies are being printed.\r\nAnother pamphlet, entitled Telepathy and Allied Phenomena by Mrs\r\nHeywood, with a section on experimental E.S.P. by Dr Soal, is in the Press,\r\nand will shortly be issued. An Outline of the Society's history by the\r\nPresident is also in the Press. Pamphlets on physical phenomena by Mrs Goldney, and on the mediumship of Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard by Mrs Salter and Rev. C. Drayton\r\nThomas are also in preparation.\r\nThe Council decided to hold in the Autumn four public lectures, particulars of which are given under paragraph 15. The lectures were well\r\nattended. As they were likely to raise many points of interest, it was\r\ndecided to hold a public Discussion Meeting at Caxton Hall in January at which questions could be asked, and general discussion would be invited.\r\nMembers of the Society have given lectures before various organisations,\r\nincluding the Societies for Psychical Research at Oxford, Cambridge, and\r\nDurham Universities and at a recently formed Society in Manchester, to which our Council wishes every success.\r\nJAN. 1948 Annual Report of the Council\r\nNumerous requests reach the Society from all parts of the country to provide lecturers, and the Council endeavours to meet them as far as practicable.\r\n5. Changes on the Council. At the last Annual General Meeting the\r\nHon. Secretary reported with great regret the very serious illness of MrWhately Carington, who was a Council member of very long standing, and\r\nhad made distinguished contributions both to our research work and to the\r\nliterature of the subject. From this illness he never recovered, and by his\r\ndeath on March loth the Council suffered a grievous loss. To fill the vacancy thus created among the elected members the Council\r\nappointed Mr Parsons, and to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Sir\r\nErnest Bennett, recorded in the Journal for January-Februaiy, they\r\nappointed Miss Bosanquet.\r\nBrigadier Firebrace, Dr A. J. B. Robertson, Mr R. Wilson and Professor\r\nF. J. M. Stratton have been co-opted to the Council.\r\n6. Presidency. Mr W. H. Salter was elected President for 1947.\r\n7. Myers Memorial Lecture. Dr S. G. Soal was appointed to deliver the\r\nNinth Lecture in this series. He chose for his subject \" The Experimental\r\nSituation in Psychical Research \". The Lecture v\/hich will shortly be\r\npublished, was delivered at Caxton Hall on the 21st November. The\r\nCouncil are glad to learn that the Central Research Fund of London University has awarded a grant of \u00a370 to Dr Soal for the continuation of his\r\nresearch work, as described in his Lecture, and for the purchase of apparatus.\r\n8. The Journal. During the current year Miss Bosanquet kindly under- . took the post of Hon. Editor, notwithstanding her many other duties. Toher, and to Mrs Hejrvvood who has assisted her, the Council wish to record\r\ntheir thanks.\r\nSix numbers of Journal \u2022wtre issued, one being a \" public \" number.\r\nThe Council hope to issue more \" public \" numbers in future, but rather\r\ndifferent contents are needed in an issue intended for the public from what\r\nare suitable for private circulation among our members. This means a good deal of planning, and for the present the Council think that the form\r\nof literature most likely to interest readers, whom our Proceedings may not\r\nreach, consists of the Pamphlets referred to in paragraph 4 above.\r\n9. Donations. The Council wish to acknowledge with the warmest\r\nthanks a further generous donation of ;\u00a3500 from Mrs Blennerhassett to the\r\nfund that bears her name.\r\n10. Library. The Council feel that the Society's financial position, if the savings made during the war are taken into account, justifies them in\r\nmaking an efl^ort to increase the number of books on the shelves, but at the\r\npresent time books suitable for the Library are hard to obtain.\r\nWe are glad to note a substantial increase in the number of books borrowed by Members from the Library, the total number of books lent during\r\nthe year being 1,188.\r\n11. The Combined Index. The Council congratulate Dr West on having\r\ncompleted the compilation of a Combined Index for our Proceedings and\r\nJournal since 191 3, when the last volume of the index was issued. The\r\nnew volume has been badly needed for a long time, but its issue has been\r\nheld up for various reasons : it is now in the Press. The- Council wish to\r\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research JAN. 1948\r\nthank Mr M. T. Hindson, Miss Watkins and others for help in checking\r\nthe index before it was sent to the printers.\r\n12. Obituary. In addition to Sir Ernest Bennett and Mr Carington, the\r\nSociety has lost by death Dr Nicholas Murray Butler, and Professor Max\r\nDessoir, the two Senior Corresponding Members, and Lord Rayleigh,\r\nPresident, 1937-1938.\r\n13. Membership of the Society. During the year 166 new Members and\r\n9 Student-Associates were elected. The total loss in members from deaths,\r\nresignations and other causes, including 15 members resident in various\r\nparts of Europe before the war with whom the Society has not been able to establish contact since the war ended, was 57 Members and 14 Associates,\r\nleaving a net increase of 105 in the total membership, which now stands at 869.\r\n14. Publications. One Part of Proceedings was published during the\r\nyear. Part 173. Six numbers of the Journal, were issued, including one\r\navailable for sale to the public. \u00ab The Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to ^83 178 and to members of the Society \u00a31^2 3 10 ; and \u00a335 o 6 to members and the\r\npublic through the Society's agent in the United States.\r\n15.

The offer closed on December 31st 1947.\r\nThe Council of the Society very kindly agreed to lend the services of\r\ntheir Research Officer as final arbiter of the genuineness of the phenomena,\r\nand to allow their seance room and infra-red telsecope to be used for the\r\npurposes of the investigation. The Council must not, however, be held\r\nresponsible for any opinions expressed in the following account, which is in fact the report of an entirely independent and private investigation.\r\nA notice of the prize offer appeared in the Journal for June-July 1947,\r\nand wide publicity was given to the matter in the psychic press. ^ Representatives of several spiritualist institutions who employ mediums (such as the\r\nLondon Spiritualist Alliance, the Marylebone Spiritualist Association and\r\nthe Institute of Paranormal Psychology) were notified by letter. Various\r\nprominent mediums were approached personally.\r\nIn spite of this widespread appeal, by the time the closing date arrived\r\nonly three mediums had responded, and none had succeeded in producingany phenomena.\r\nThis result lends strong support to the arguments of those persons whocontend that the claims of contemporary physical mediums and their\r\nsupporters are founded upon fraud and malobservation. It cannot be\r\nargued that the test prevented the phenomena, since the mediums were\r\nallowed to sit uncontrolled and in their own conditions. It really seems as\r\nif the presence of the infra-red telescope, which obviates the cruder types\r\nof fraud, puts paid to the mediums' whole performance.\r\nIt is instructive to note the reasons given by some prominent mediums\r\nfor declining to take up the offer. Mrs Estelle Roberts (clairvoyante and direct voice medium) wrote : \" I am not interested in your offer of a prize for any demonstration of what\r\nI believe to be a religious belief.\"\r\nMr Ronald Strong (direct voice and materialisation) and Mr Charles\r\nBasham (materialisation) both appeared to agree to investigation, but\r\nalthough frequently prompted, neither was ever able to fix a date.\r\nMr Ronald Cockersell (direct voice and materialisation) said he was not\r\ninterested in convincing S.P.R. investigators. Genuine phenomena could\r\nnot be guaranteed like \" a hen laying an egg \". Arnold Clare (direct voice) said he had periods when he could get no phenomena, and we had asked him at such a time.\r\n^ Notices appeared in Light, Prediction, Psychic Truth, Psychic News and The\r\nJournal of Experimental Metaphysics.\r\n^54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan. 1948\r\nHunter Selkirk and Alec Harris (materialisation) did not reply to our\r\nletters. Leslie Flint (direct voice) had to think it over, but never came to a\r\ndecision.\r\nMrs Helen Duncan (materialisation) was very definite in her refusal,\r\nsaying that she would not sit at the S.P.R., \" for a million \". Arthur Phillips (materialisation) was considering the offer when he was\r\nexposed by other investigators, who captured a false beard. ( See Psychic\r\nNews 2 August 1947.)\r\nAs mentioned in the interim announcement in the September Journal,\r\nMr Frank Allen, an apport medium, was the first to take up the offer. On 19 May 1947 the Research Officer was present at Mr Allen's house\r\ncircle, at which, during periods of complete darkness, \" apports \" of\r\nflowers were obtained. The only noteworthy feature of the sitting was that\r\ntowards the end, Mrs Davies, wife of the medium's manager, remarked that\r\nMr X was the only sitter who had not received any flowers, and suggested\r\nto a neighbour that she let him have some of hers. This incident took place\r\nbefore the \" guide \" announced that there would be no more flowers.\r\nOn 28 May, Mr Allen came to the S.P.R. accompanied by three friends.\r\nBefore entering the seance room they were asked to step out of their own\r\nclothes into garments prepared by the investigators. In these circumstances no \" apports \" were produced, and an ofl'er of further sittings v\/as\r\nnot taken up.\r\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and negotiation on the part of an enthusiastic member of the Society, Mrs D. M. Seccombe, a direct voice medium,\r\nwas prevailed upon to give us some sittings. To the first of these, on 25\r\nAugust 1947, the medium came unaccompanied. She went into an alleged\r\ntrance and her \" control \" spoke, but there was no direct voice and no\r\nphysical eftects were produced. The only point of interest was that the\r\nmedium was seen (through the telescope) to lean over and whisper behind\r\nthe necks of adjacent sitters. The speeches made by the \" controls \" were\r\nchildish and without any evidential value. Mrs Seccombe came on three\r\nother occasions, (28 August, 30 October and i November) each time\r\naccompanied by some of her own friends, but no physical phenomena\r\noccurred. The m.edium's friends said they could see various spirit lights\r\nand luminous shapes which were not seen by the rest \"of the sitters. The\r\ntelescope was switched off at times to make sure that it was not the cause\r\nof the lack of phenomena.\r\nThe third medium, Mr William Roy, after a preliminary visit to inspect\r\nthe infra-red telescope, came for a sitting on 13 October 1947. He was to bring with him his own circle of sitters, but on the day of the sitting he\r\ninformed us that they declined to accompany him. Mr Roy went into an\r\nalleged trance and the \" control \" spoke, but no physical phenomena\r\noccurred. Mr Roy declared himself satisfied with the conditions at the time,\r\nand agreed to come again a fortnight later. However, he later cancelled\r\nthis appointment, on the plea of another engagement, and failed to give an\r\nalternative date. On 12 December he was reminded by letter that the ofl^er closed on 31 December. He replied that neither time-limits nor Prize\r\nMoney interested him, but gave one to understand that he might offer himself to the S.P.R. for investigation in 1948.\r\nJAN. 1948 Coincidence or Precognition? - 155\r\nCOINCIDENCE OR PRECOGNITION?\r\nThe following statements provided by two members of the Society are examples of a kind of experience which appears to be not uncommon in\r\nconnection with unarranged and unexpected meetings with friends. Neither\r\nof the contributors suggest that coincidence is ruled out, but the cases are\r\nat least sufficiently interesting to be put on record. . -\r\nCase I. Mr Eric Cuddon's Experiences\r\nIn June, 1940, when serving in the R.A.F., I was stationed at Plymouth\r\nand there met an old friend, Geoffrey Holt, who was serving in the Army.\r\nI left Plymouth in July, 1940, and did not see or hear from Holt again until\r\nthe following incident : In February, 1942, I was staying in London with my wife on 48 hours'\r\nleave and we went to tea at Fortnum & Mason's. We sat at a table just\r\noutside the entrance doorway to the large inner tea room. I suddenly\r\nremarked that I wondered what had become of Geoffrey Holt from whomwe had not heard since I saw him in Plymouth in 1940. About two minutes\r\nlater a voice said, \" Hello Eric \". I looked up to see Holt standing before me. I was so astonished that for a moment I was speechless. He had\r\nbeen having tea far inside the inner room where I could neither have seen him nor heard his voice.\r\nThis incident much impressed me although on this occasion I attributed\r\nit to pure coincidence. \u2014\r\nI did not hear from him again until the following incident occurred : In June, 1943, my wife and I arranged to spend 14 days' leave exploring\r\nthe River Thames by punt and steamer, and stayed at the Grove Hall\r\nHotel, Twyford. A few days before leaving, during a night duty at myRadar Station at Cricklade, Wilts, I had recounted the incident above\r\ndescribed, at Fortnum & Masons', to my Radar Operators and stated that I should not be in the least surprised if I again met Geoffrey Holt during\r\nmy coming leave on the River.\r\nOn a Sunday morning during that leave we took a steamer from Henley\r\nto Maidenhead in company with my cousin, Richard Cuddon, and his\r\nwife, and when the steamer was in Hurley Lock I looked over the side. There, in a punt, was Geoffrey Holt and his wife. They were staying at the\r\nCompleat Angler Hotel, Marlow, on their honeymoon. Having arranged\r\na further meeting, I reboarded the steamer and immediately announced to my wife and my cousin and his wife my conviction that we should meet\r\nMaureen King at Maidenhead. As will be seen from the accompanying\r\nstatements, this prediction proved correct. At the time I made the prediction, I said : \" I can't think why on earth I should say that.\" The last time we had heard from this old friend, whose married name was and is \" de Carteret \", was about a year previously, when she was living near her\r\nhusband's Air Force Station in Lincolnshire. Geoffrey Holt and Mrs de\r\nCarteret had never met and there was absolutely nothing in the way of\r\nassociation of ideas which could have made me think of Mrs de Carteret\r\nthrough having met Geoffrey Holt.\r\nEric Cuddon\r\n156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN. 1948\r\nMrs Eric Cuddon writes : \" I corroborate the incidents in February, 1943, and June, 1943, referred\r\nto by my husband in the above statements, except his alleged statements to\r\nhis Radar Operators when I was not present.\"\r\nMr Hugh Richard Cuddon writes ; \" On a Sunday in June, 1943, my wife and I were in the company of my\r\ncousin, Eric Cuddon, and his wife, Doris, on a pleasure steamer sailing from\r\nHenley to Maidenhead. During this excursion, whilst the steamer was\r\nwaiting at a river lock, Eric saw and greeted a friend of his who was in a smaller craft nearby. At about this time during the journey Eric stated\r\nthat he felt sure we should also meet that day a certain Maureen King\u2014a\r\nperson then unknown to me. We continued our journey and disembarked at Maidenhead, and all four\r\nin company walked along the riverside roadway. On reaching a restaurant,\r\nthe name of which I do not remember although I have some recollection of\r\nits external appearance, Eric and Doris exclaimed their surprise at seeing\r\ntwo ladies seated on a terrace in front of the restaurant. From the introductions which followed I learned that one of these ladies was Mrs de Carteret. It was only during the conversation which followed that I learned\r\nfurther that Mrs de Carteret's maiden name was King and that she was in\r\nfact the Maureen King whom Eric had expressed his certainty that we\r\nshould meet.\"\r\nMrs H. R. Cuddon writes : \" I well remember the events described above and completely agree with\r\nwhat my husband has written.\"\r\nMrs de Carteret writes : \" I am the wife of Philip de Carteret and I have been a personal friend of\r\nEric Cuddon for many years. My maiden name was King.\r\nI well remember a Sunday in June, 1943. I was at the time doing War\r\nwork in a factory at Maidenhead and was spending the day with my mother,\r\nwho was staying at the hotel facing the river near Boulter's Lock. At about\r\n4 p.m. I was surprised to see Eric and his wife, who called to me from the\r\nroad as I was sitting in the front garden with my mother. He was in company with another man and woman whom he introduced as his cousin and\r\nhis cousin's wife, Richard and Betty Cuddon. They stated that Eric had\r\nannounced his conviction that they would see me at Maidenhead when on\r\nboard a steamer in Hurley Lock earlier in the afternoon.\r\nThe last time I had written to or otherwise communicated with Eric or his wife was about a year previously when I was living in Lincolnshire near my husband's Air Force Station. Neither my mother nor I had been\r\nthinking of the Cuddons that day.\"\r\nMrs King writes : \" I clearly remember the incident mentioned above and corroborate the\r\nstatement signed by my daughter.\"\r\nJAN. 1948 An Apparently Precognitive Dream 157\r\nCase II. A Small Boy's Enquiries\r\nThe account which follows is of interest as being similar in kind to the\r\npreceding case, but unfortunately the circumstances are such that full corro- boration and investigation of details is impossible. The account is written\r\nby a member of the Society who knew the people concerned very well. The X family had two little boys of 6 and 3 years old. They also had a\r\nfriend, Y, who knew the children quite well, though he did not often see them. He had an unfortunate habit of going off, at irregular intervals, ondrinking bouts ; and his mother, who was also a friend of the X family,\r\nused, when he had been away too long, to ring up Mr X and ask him to have a look for her son in his usual haunts, and see if he was all right. Onthese occasions he was usually brought back to the X household, given\r\nblack coffee and aspirin, and put to sleep on the drawing room sofa before\r\nbeing sent off to his family in a state of rather pink-eyed sobriety next\r\nmorning. The X children used to see him at breakfast.\r\nThis state of affairs went on at intervals for two years. After a time MrsX began to notice that whenever the younger boy said, \" Where's Mr Y?We haven't seen him for a long time\", Mr Y's mother would ring up that same evening ; and in due course Mr Y himself would be retrieved. MrsX even took to getting out the spare blankets in readiness for her guest\r\nwhen the little boy made this enquiry.\r\nMrs X writes : \"I fully corroborate all the statements in the above\r\naccount.\"\r\nAN APPARENTLY PRECOGNITIVE DREAM\r\nThis case, sent to us by Mr H. Ballard Thomas, was accompanied by the\r\nfollowing letter : Dear Sir,\r\nI am not in a position to corroborate directly any of the facts recorded in the accompanying statement, but since it is largely at my suggestion that Mr Ballard Thomas has written his account I am glad to be\r\nable to say something about two of the persons concerned, Mr Thomashimself and Mr Bernard Spurry.\r\nBoth of these are students in the department in which I lecture ; I knowboth well, and my acquaintance with Mr Thomas in particular goes well\r\nbeyond the usual contact between teacher and student. I can testify to the\r\ncomplete integrity and the intellectual ability of both these men. Both are Ordinands of the Church in ^Vales, and both rank among the best of the\r\nstudents at present studying Philosophy in this College. Neither can be\r\nsuspected of anything in the nature of wilful mis-statement, and both have -the ability and temperament necessary to guard against unintentional error.\r\nI have not the slightest doubt that the accomipanying account is as accurate\r\na record of actual events as such a statement, which inevitably depends\r\nlargely on memory, can well be.\r\nI shall of coarse be pleased to answer any questions you may care to ask\r\nin this matter, if these are within my power to deal with.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nGeorge E. Hughes, Lecturer in Philosophy,\r\nUniversity College of South Wales and Monmouthshire.\r\n158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN. 1948\r\nMr Ballard Thomas's Account\r\nDuring the summer of 1946 I was in retreat at an English convent. In\r\nthe middle of the night of the 28th of August I awoke suddenly following\r\na very vivid dream. (I recall the date well for two reasons : (a) I made a. brief reference to it in my diary {b) The following day was the Feast of the\r\nBeheading of St John the Baptist, i.e. the 29th.) The exact details of the\r\ndream ^vvere not very clear but a few points remained in my mind, viz. that\r\nit occurred in a strange building (possibly a church) that it involved some\r\nfriends of mine whom I could recognise (a young deacon I knew\u2014Rev.\r\nBruce Davies and two fellow ordinands of mine\u2014T. Douglas Harris,\r\nBernard D. A. Spurry) ; that some confusion existed over the \" ordination \" of a priest of whom I had previously heard. It was the vividness of\r\nthe dream that impressed me most, and I felt sure that if those circumstances would ever actually occur I would be able to recognise them\r\nimmediately. I made a brief mention of the fact to an aunt of mine who\r\nwas residing at the Convent at the same time and also the Sister Joyce\r\nHilda. I wrote in my diary : \"I wonder if anything will come of this queer\r\ndreatn about \" ordination and Bruce \".\r\nIt was on Advent Sunday following, i December 1946, that the event,\r\noccurred again, but this time in actual fact. I went with my friend\r\nBernard Spurry to St Luke's Church, Canton, Cardiff (where the Rev.\r\nBruce Davies is a curate) to attend a Sung Mass at 1 1 a.m. On arrival at the church we were joined by T. Douglas Harris (N.B. we had not previously arranged to meet there). When the service was over, the three of us waited in the porch to see Mr Davies. He joined us there and in a few\r\nminutes I realised that a situation which was already familiar to me was\r\nforming itself about me. The group in the porch now consisted of the\r\nfollowing people : Rev. Bruce Davies, T. D. Harris, B. D. A. Spurry, Rev.\r\nFr Reid (Vicar), Mrs Reid (his mother), Mr Williams, an ordinand from\r\nSt Michael's College, Llandaff. (These three last-named people I had\r\nnever met before, but I was absolutely sure that I had seen them\u2014in a dream.) The conversation turned to the subject of a priest whom I knew\r\nwho was being transferred to another parish. I was absolutely certain then\r\nthat this was the dream which I had had before\u2014though I could not quite\r\nremember when at that moment. In a flash I was aware of the way in\r\nwhich the conversation would develop and the most urgent thing in my\r\nmind was the fore-knowledge that in the discussion that would follow the\r\nMr Williams (whom I had not previously met) would refer to the \" ordination \" of this priest in mistake for his \" induction \". I felt sure that I would like to break the spell (if it may be so termed) by making some\r\ndeliberately irrelevant remark myself, but I found that for some reason which I will in no way attempt to explain I was quite unable to say or do a\r\nthing. It felt like some kind of mental paralysis, and I admit that I did feel quite alarmed at the whole affair. The conversation developed exactly as\r\nI \" knew \" it would, and immediately the mistake which I had already\r\nanticipated had actually been made, it was as if the entire \" set-up \" '\r\nfaded away and resolved itself into ordinary existence once again. On the\r\nway home I told Bernard Spurry of what had happened and also checked\r\nup in my diary the date of the actual dream.\r\nJAN. 1948 An Apparently Precognitive Dream \" 159\r\nObservations. \"\r\n1 . Although previously I had been unable to recall the actual details of\r\nthe dream, immediately the correct setting was built up around me I was\r\nable to tell quite clearly the exact things that would happen, though I was\r\nquite powerless to change that course of events.\r\n2. The dream itself was one of unusual force, because whereas I amconscious of having dreamt most nights I am never awakened by them.\r\n3. The only other time on which I have experienced a thing of this kind was when as a boy at school I dreamt a Geometry lesson so vividly that the\r\nfollowing day I w^as able to forestall the master with an irrelevant remark\r\nhe was about to make\u2014to his great consternation of course. The incident\r\nis now too long ago to be recalled in detail.\r\nI hereby declare that this is as true and accurate an account of the\r\nincident as I am able to recall. (Signed)\r\n>\r\n- H. Ballard Thomas\r\nThe following corroborative statements were enclosed :\r\nI hereby declare that I was present at St Luke's Church canton on the\r\noccasion referred to above, and that the meeting mentioned did take place.\r\nI have no recollection, however, of the Rev. Fr Reid's being there, but this\r\nmay be due to lapse of memory. On the way home Mr Thomas did mention the experience he had had.\r\nSigned,\r\n. Bernard D. A. Spurry\r\n\u2022 ID November 1947\r\nI hereby declare that I have seen the diar}- entry referred to above and\r\nthat the statement made is correct.(signed)\r\nPhilip A. C. Bowman\r\nMr Thomas added : \" Sister Joyce Hilda is unable to recollect my having told her [about the\r\ndream] although she says I may well. have done [so].\"\r\nResearch Officer's Comment.\r\nThis interesting case might have a normal explanation. The dream as remembered before the event was to the effect that Mr Thomas and three\r\nfriends would be having a conversation in a strange building on the subject\r\nof \" ordination \". This actually happened some three months later. In\r\nview of this lapse of time, and the commonplace circumstances of the premonition, chance coincidence would give a reasonable explanation.\r\nWhile the dream was apparently being fulfilled, Mr Thomas recollected\r\na lot more details, and had a definite feeling that he knew what was going\r\nto happen next, although something seemed to prevent him from speaking\r\nup. This could have been an example of the very common illusion of\r\ndeja vu, in which the mechanism of recognition is not working properly,\r\nand the subject experiences a false sensation of reliving something which\r\ni6o Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan. 1948\r\nhas happened once before. The sHght chance resemblance of the actual\r\nsituation to the circumstances of the dream may have been the precipitating cause of the illusion. Although the experience of deja vu is generally regarded as illusory, so\r\nfar as I know it has never been investigated with a view to detecting any\r\ntrue precognitive element. In view of this and similar cases, such an\r\ninvestigation might be well worth while. If there are any members of the\r\nSociety who frequently have this feeling of deja vu, would they please get\r\nin touch with me.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nSir,\u2014While we acknowledge the entertainment value of the account in the\r\nNovember Journal of Mr Cuddon's experiment with pendulums, we are puzzled as to what it is supposed to prove. In his last two paragraphs, Mr\r\nCuddon seems to suggest the absurd idea that he has proved that the pendulums could not be moved by the power of thought alone. That they\r\ncould not is what any sensible person would expect, but, whether this is the\r\ncase or not is plainly not proved by Mr Cuddon's experiment. The fact that I might be able to convince a sufficiently credulous audience that I was\r\nbalancing a pencil on my finger tip when in reality I had stuck it there with\r\na piece of cobbler's wax would not prove that no one could balance a pencil on his finger tip. Perhaps Mr Cuddon's woman doctor and \" apparently\r\nintelligent man \" knew of Dr Winther's experiments in which movement\r\nof pendulums \" by the power of thought alone \" apparently takes place.\r\nThere seems no logical reason why their opinions should have been altered\r\nby Mr Cuddon's demonstration.\r\nOn the other hand Mr Cuddon does seem to have succeeded in demonstrating that if you make false statements to people some of them will believe you. We have no doubt that this is true although perhaps not\r\naltogether novel. It would seem that the majority of Mr Cuddon's audi- ence had a mistaken opinion as to the relative likelihood of two improbabilities : (i) that the pendulums were moved by spirits, (ii) that the experimenter, the Research Officer of the Society and other persons taking part were deceiving the audience. One may also conclude that, if pressed to do\r\nso, many people will form positive opinions on insufficient grounds. The\r\nevidence for this is indeed wider than Mr Cuddon seems to realise since\r\nthose who concluded that the movement of the pendulums was due to pushing (voluntary or involuntary) had also formed a positive opinion on\r\ninsufficient grounds since the conditions of the experiment were not such\r\nas to enable an onlooker to determine what was the cause of movement of\r\nthe pendulums. The right answer to Mr Cuddon's question was obviously\r\n\" I don't know \", but apparently the audience were not allowed to give this answer. Yours faithfully,\r\nR. H. Thouless\r\nB. P. WiESNER\r\nJAN. 1948 Correspondence 161\r\nSir,\u2014I thoroughly enjoyed reading the trenchant criticism by Drs\r\nThouless and Wiesner of my Report in the last issue of a simple experiment\r\nwith Pendulums demonstrated to a small audience at the headquarters of a now unhappily defunct Society.\r\nI regard it as a compliment that men so eminent in the field of Psychic\r\nResearch should have thought so trivial a matter worthy of such incisive\r\nanalysis and I trust they will not regard it as presumptuous on my part when\r\nI say that I am in complete accord with their observations with regard to the negative result of the demonstration insofar as any matter of proof is involved.\r\nI am also most happy to resolve their puzzlement\u2014the demonstration was never intended to prove anything and hence it is scarcely surprising\r\nthat, when my Report is subjected to the searching analysis of scientific method, it is found that in fact nothing was proved. It is rather like using an Atom Bomb to destroy a Doll's House!\r\nWhat I did set out to do and what I believe I successfully accomplished was to impress upon my audience the need for the greatest caution before\r\nattributing to a paranormal cause that which might be due to a normal\r\ncause. In this connexion I wanted them to realise that they should employ their\r\ncritical faculties to the same extent when they had complete confidence in\r\nthe demonstrator as when he might be unknown to them.\r\nIncidentally I think it would be more accurate to describe the statements\r\nwhich I made to the audience as \" misleading \" rather than \" false \" though no doubt the moralist would equally condemn both.\r\nIf my recollection is accurate I believe some persons abstained from\r\nvoting so some of them at least mav have come to a correct decision, namely,\r\n\" I don't know.\"\r\nIt should be made clear that Dr West was assisting me as a personal\r\nfriend and not in his official capacity as Research Officer of the Society for\r\nPsychical Research.\r\nFinally, may I venture to express the hope that neither Dr Wiesner nor Dr Thouless may ever be misled to conclude, through misplaced belief in\r\nthe lack of guile of a person whom they may be investigating for the purpose of establishing evidence of paranormal cognition, that such powers are exhibited by such person when, if they v\/ere to apply the same searching\r\nand valuable analysis as they have honoured me by directing towards myReport they might be led to a different conclusion.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nEric Cuddon\r\nSir,\u2014Mr Cuddon's experiment with an audience which was decribed\r\nin the November issue, was not designed to prove anything in connection with the movement of pendulums, but was designed to bring home\r\nto his audience, by a vivid and telling little demonstration, a lack of balanced judgment in those who glibly postulated the paranormal at work.\r\nNeither w'as there any question of real deception, since the audience was expressly given alternatives to select from, one of which was that the\r\nmovement of the pendulums was caused by the table being pushed by MrCuddon and his accomplices. Some \" stage misdirection \" was immedi-\r\nl62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN. 1948\r\nately resolved when the demonstration had effected its object, and the\r\naudience was given the facts. Of course, \" I don't know \" was the final answer to Mr Cuddon's question, as Drs Thouless and Wiesner say. But the audience had been asked\r\nto state what they thought was the cause of the pendulums' movements.\r\nWhat were the facts? How should the audience have argued? Surely, as follows :\r\n(1) They knew nothing about the movement of pendulums (it is safe to hazard this for the majority of those present on that occasion).\r\n(2) They were not controlling the experiment and therefore could not be\r\nsure of the experimental conditions.\r\n(3) Normal pushing by the experimenters was one possibility expressly\r\nsuggested to them.\r\n(4) Mr Cuddon had never, to their knowledge, been credited with paranormal powers before, nor had his helpers.\r\n(5) Paranormal faculty is very, very rare. (6) Even when it is possessed, one cannot produce it on any given\r\noccasion, still less at a given moment of time.\r\nThese considerations, particularly the last two, should obviously have\r\nled the audience to postulate a normal explanation in preference to psi, as the answer to Mr Cuddon's question. Instead, a majority of those voting\r\nshowed a readiness to accept the hypothesis of movement of pendulums by\r\nSpirit Guides as easily as if this were a recognised everyday occurrence, and\r\nthey thus displayed an entire lack of balanced judgment.\r\nI am astonished that Drs Thouless and Wiesner should allude to Dr\r\nWinther's experiments as ones in which the movement of pendulums by\r\nthe power of thought alone \" apparently takes place \". There have been\r\nnone, I think, to which very serious consideration should be given, i.e., none\r\nreaching the standard of experimental conditions required in the past by\r\nour Society. Furthermore, reports have lately reached this Society from a responsible quarter repudiating Dr Winther's views and questioning the\r\nbona fides of the medium with whom his pendulum experiments took place.\r\nKnowledge of his experiments should not for a moment be allowed to weigh in the balance such considerations as those enumerated above.\r\nIf v\/e can consider that the existence of paranormal faculty has been demonstrated, at least let us always bear in mind that its demonstrable occur- rence is exceedingly rare (in this country at least!) and that only when all normal possibilities have been exhaustively excluded is it proper to postulate the paranormal\u2014not only on paper but in one's own mind. To allow\r\noneself to drift into an undiscriminating attitude of mind and to proceed as\r\nif normal or paranormal explanations were equally possible, not only\r\nrelaxes the mental discipline which is so vitally necessary in psychical\r\nresearch, but discredits the psychical researcher's reports of those very\r\nrare occasions when, it would seem, experimental conditions were all that\r\ncould be desired and all possible normal explanations failed to account for\r\nthe phenomena observed.\r\nYours etc.,\r\n\u2022 K. M. GOLDNEY\r\nJAN. 1948 Correspondence 163\r\nSir,\u2014I have read with interest the letters contributed to the DecemberJournal by Mrs Heywood, Mr RawclifFe and Mr Proctor. It is my belief\r\nhowever that Mr Proctor is wrong in supposing that scientific men as a whole are prepared to accept telepathy on the strength of a few watertight experiments. According to his predisposition to believe or the\r\nreverse an individual scientist might be convinced by seeing such an\r\nexperiment or on the other hand suspect that he had been hoaxed by a party of tricksters or conjurors.\r\nIt is, I submit, not the \"perfect \" experiment that science is waiting for but\r\nthe winning of experimental control over the phenomena which will enable\r\nalmost anyone to carry out a successful experiment in telepathy. Until\r\nthis stage is reached I feel certain that telepathy will remain a dubious\r\nand unwelcome intruder into the scientific domxain no matter how manyfraud-proof and fool-proof experiments we devise. Psychical researchers,\r\ntherefore, instead of organising fraud-proof experiments, would do a\r\nbetter service to their subject by making concentrated efforts to discover\r\nwhat are the essential bodily and psychological conditions which favour\r\nthe emergence of the telepathic impression. Above all we want research\r\ninto the personality factors which are associated with possessors of the\r\npsychic gift. We require reliable psychological tests which will enable\r\nus to separate the psychics from the non-psychics. The work initiated\r\nby Dr Humphrey in this connection may prove more important than all the water-tight experiments. If successful, it will need no other justification than the results themselves and the increased experimental control\r\nthese results may give us over the extra-sensoiy faculty.\r\nOnce we are able to tell the scientist how to demonstrate telepathy for\r\nhimself we need bother no more about witnesses and fool-proof tests. Let us get hold of the right end of the stick and aim at the right objectives.\r\nMr Proctor's ciiteria for accepting or rejecting experimental evidence\r\nwhile of value seem to me somewhat dogrnatic and narrow. For instance,\r\nhe requires odds against chance of \" a million to one \". On that estimate\r\nMr Whately Carington's picture-guessing experim.ent would surely suffer\r\nrejection at Mr Proctor's hands, slice the odds only amounted to a few\r\nthousands to one. Even the sceptical Coover admitted that odds of fifty\r\nthousand to one would satisfy him as evidence for telepathy. (And\r\ncuriously Professor (now Sir Cyril) Burt demonstrated quite clearly that an \" over all \" estimate of Coover's card-guessing experiments did provide\r\nodds against chance of about fifty thousand to one!)\r\nOn the other hand a distinguished mathematician known to me as a hard-bitten materialist remarked a few weeks ago that \" even though Soal\r\nhas obtained odds of lo^s to i against chance he is not justified in claiming\r\nthat the effects are not due to chance. However great the odds, chance\r\nmay have produced the results.\" And logically of course I am not\r\njustified. The mere fact that we possess no better criterion than a statistical one should be an incentive towards getting more experimental\r\ncontrol.\r\nMr Proctor seems to treat the phenomenon of extra-sensory cognition\r\nas if it were an ordinary physical phenomenon ; Mrs Heywood does not\r\nfall into this error. Mr Proctor apparently assumes that if telepathic\r\nphenomena occur in the presence of A, B, C and the sensitive S they ought\r\n164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN. 1948\r\nto occur in the presence of D, E, F and S. If telepathy were a pliysical or even a conscious mental phenomenon the assumption would probably\r\nbe justified. But everything seems to point to the assumption that tele- pathy is due to the collaboration of two or more subconscious minds. We\r\ndo not know enough about the influence which the minds of the observers\r\nhave on the production of telepathy to justify the assumption that given S\r\nit does not matter who A, B, C are. In demanding that it should be possible to obtain results with \" almost any experimenter \" Mr Proctor may\r\nbe asking for what is impossible in our present state of ignorance.\r\nTelepathy may well depend upon delicate psychological adjustments\r\nwhich may be upset when there is a too sudden or radical change in the\r\npersonnel. Again it is the almost universal experience of investigators\r\nthat even the best telepathic subjects fall off in their performance after a longer or shorter period and often appear to lose their faculty altogether.\r\nProfessor Chester Kellogg argued that a man who has learned to play the\r\nviolin does not suddenly and mysteriously lose his skill ; therefore if a telepathic percipient suddenly loses his power there must be something\r\nfishy about it. But the analogy between a consciously acquired skill and a faculty like telepathy that is not under conscious control may be altogether\r\nmisleading and the comparison may not be justified. Instead of dictating\r\nto Nature it would be wiser to seek patiently to understand her ways.\r\nInstead of bemoaning the fact that extra-sensory phenomena do not fulfil our expectations based on our experience of sensory phenomena let us\r\ntry to discover what laws they do obey. But if we concentrate all our\r\nenergies in trying to convince sceptics who do not want to be convinced\r\nof the existence of E.S.P. we shall succeed neither in converting the\r\nsceptics nor in making the discoveries essential for future progress.\r\nIn conclusion we must not insist that because one sensitive has produced\r\na particular type of phenomena another can be found who is able to produce almost identical results. Each psychic may have his own pattern\r\nand as Dr Osty once remarked there may be as many kinds of telepathy\r\nas there are telepathic subjects. Basil Shackleton produced certain displacement phenomena of a special type. It is true that so far no sensitive\r\nhas produced quite the same effects but nevertheless both backward and\r\nforward displacement have been observed both in this country and in\r\nAmerica. C. E. Stuart found highly significant evidence af backward and\r\nforward displacement in his picture-guessing tests. In a letter to Nature\r\nabout two years ago Mr Arthur T. Oram published a brief account of a highly significant (-1) displacement (precognitive) which he found in experiments with playing cards. At the time of publication Mr. Oram\r\nwas unaware of the experiments of Mrs Goldney and myself. Mr Proctor\r\ntherefore is in error in supposing that there has been no independent\r\nverification of the phenomenon of displacement.\r\nI heartily agree with Mr Rawcliffe that certain papers and articles published of late years in both the Journal and the Proceedings are not\r\nlikely to enhance our reputation in the eyes of the scientific world. For\r\nthe Society to alternate pieces of sound investigation with papers of a wretchedly inferior quality is, I believe, a harmful policy.\r\nYours, etc. S. G. SOAL\r\nJ.\\N. 1948 Reviews\r\nREVIEWS\r\nThe Journal of Parapsychology, No. 3, Vol. XL, September 1947.\r\nThe Editorial by Dr Rhine gives a short account of the excursion into\r\nparapsycholog)' made by the late Dr Pierre Janet in 1885-6.\r\nMiss Betty Humphrey has an account of an experiment in which two\r\ndifferent sets of dice were thrown simultaneously with the aim that one set should give a high score on the one face while the other should give a low\r\nscore on that face. The necessary precautions against bias were taken and\r\na significant difference was found between the scores of the two sets suggesting that the subject could score in both directions at once. Apparently,\r\nhowever, the experimenter allowed herself some freedom in deciding\r\nwhich aim to adopt in each series of experiments since she speaks of deciding in advance which series she would work on. This freedom seems an\r\nobjectionable feature of experimental design since positive results may be\r\ndue to precognition.\r\nAn interesting review\" of the evidence for dowsing by Miss MacMahan\r\ncomes to the conclusion that the evidence for extra-sensory capacity\r\namongst some people for detecting hidden objects and water is strong,\r\nalthough the author considers that further rigorous scientific tests are\r\nnecessar}' before this can be considered an established fact. There is a further discussion by Dr Pratt of the restricted area of a PK.\r\nseries in which positive results are obtained, with the important practical\r\nimplication that it may be possible to design series in such a way as to reduce the part in which positive results are obtained. There are indications that the optimal design from this point of view may not be the same\r\nfor different subjects.\r\nIn the last article of this number of the Journal, Edward Bindrim develops a new method of detecting displacement effects. Whately Carington and Soal have reported cases where failure to hit the target card in\r\nE.S.P. experiments is accompanied by a significant tendency to hit some\r\nother card such as the one ahead. Bindrim is concerned with cases where\r\nthere is neither a significant tendency to hit the target card nor the one\r\nahead, yet some psi effect is indicated by the fact that in both halves of each\r\nset of twenty-five guesses there is evidence of a tendency to displacement\r\nin the same direction. While the significance is not high, there is enough\r\nto provide strong evidence of a real relationship between direction of displacement in two halves of series of guesses through a pack which is deserving of attention as one of the directions in which a psi effect may be found\r\nin series of card guesses in which there is no significance in the total score. R. H. T.\r\nThe Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus, Translated Edited and Interpreted.\r\nBy Henry C. Roberts. New York 1947 (Crown Publishers).\r\nMichel de Notredame was born at St. Remi in Provence in 1503. He\r\nstudied philosophy and the humanities at Avignon, and took a medical\r\ndegree at ]\\Iontpelier in 1 529. At Aix and Lyons he worked conscientiously\r\nduring an epidemic of plague.\r\nIn 1555 he published, at Lyons, under the pseudonym of Nostradamus,\r\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research jan. 1948\r\na book of rhymed prophecies entitled Centuries, which soon secured him\r\nthe notice of Catherine de Medici. In 1558 he pubhshed an enlarged\r\nedition, dedicated to the King of France. The early fulfilment, or seeming\r\nfulfilment of some of his predictions, brought him augmented fame ; Charles IX named him physician in ordinary, and his reputation remained\r\nhigh to the day of his death in 1566.\r\nFrom the time of the publication of the Centuries, in 1555, up to the\r\npresent age, an enormous literature has gathered upon the subject of\r\nNostradamus's prognostications. In 1605 the complete text of his quatrains was collected, based upon the Lyons edition of 1568, and this 1605\r\ntext is in the possession of the British Museum, together with earlier but\r\nincomplete editions. In 1672 an English translation was made by Theophilus de Garencieres, and printed in London, with interpretations supplied\r\nby the translator.^ It is at this point that the \" higher criticism \" of\r\nNostradamus may be said to begin.\r\nTwo hundred and seventy-five years later, Mr H. C. Roberts, of New\r\nYork, discovered that no complete \" English edition \" (by which he probbably means no complete text with English translation) had been published in the intervening years. Having procured a copy of the 1672 text, \" at an almost prohibitive price \", he has reproduced it, and published it with his own translation and interpretations. This edition will be referred\r\nto as the 1947 text. The value of Nostradamus to the psychical researcher lies in the possibility that he may have been a precognitive percipient, and, if we are to form a sound judgment upon this question, an accurate text is a sine qua\r\nnon. Apart from one or two inaccuracies, for which the printer may well\r\nhave been responsible,'^ Mr Robert's reproduction of the 1672 text is impeccable, but what he could not possibly have known (since the text of\r\n1605 was not available to him) is that the 1672 text is itself far from infallible ; and thereby hangs a tale. In the reliable edition of 1605, we read :\r\n[X, 40.] Le jeune nay au regne Britannique,\r\nQu'aura le pere mourant recommande,\r\nIcelny mort lonole donra topique,\r\nEt a son fils le Regne demande.\r\nBy 1672 LONOLE has become Londre, and Mr Roberts, of course, claims\r\nthe prophecy for the abdication of Edward VIII. Let us examine another\r\ninstance. The prophecy which made the reputation of Nostradamus, ran :\r\n[I, 35.] Le lion jeune le vieux surmontera,\r\nEn champ bellique par singulier duelle.\r\nDans cage d'or les yeux lui crevera ; Deux classes une ; puis mourir mort cruelle.\r\nIn fact, a young Scottish knight, in tournament with Henry II, accidentally put out his eye and pierced his brain ; and, by 1672, \" les yeux.\"\r\n1 This text is to be found in the Library of the S.P.R. It is unreliable.\r\n2 E.g.\u2014\" La parte solus \" for \" le part solus \"; \" La jeune nay \" for \" le jeune\r\nnay \". In each case the meaning is altered.\r\nJAN. 1948 Reviews 167\r\naccordingly became \" I'cril \", while \" classes \" turned into \" playes \"\r\nConsequently, anyone reading the text of 1947, which, as we have seen, is based upon that of 1672, will take a rosier view of the great prophet than his\r\nown words warrant.\r\nIf this were the only fault that could be found in the text of 1947, we\r\ncould hold Mr Roberts almost guiltless, since 1672 was the only source he was able to consult. There is, however, another requisite, at least for those\r\nwho are unable to read i6th century French ; and that is an accurate\r\ntranslation. In this respect, in a few instances, Mr Roberts errs badly. He\r\ntranslates \" alus \", a meaningless word, as \" All U.S.\", and here, surely,\r\nhe confuses translation with interpretation. Another example of fanciful\r\ntranslation lies in his rendering of \" Raypoz \" by \" positive ray \".\r\nIf his translation is occasionally influenced by his imagination, his interpretations are the sport of vagrant fancy. The ambassador who was sent\r\nin the small ship and repulsed by unknown men is, of course, Hess ; the \u00bbgreat lion, pulled down by Caesarous forces, is, of course, Winston Churchill. The notes abound with references to Hitler, Mussolini, the blitz,\r\nand the atomic bomb. If a reader of the text of 1605 might well wonder\r\n\" whether there is anything in all this \", a reader of the interpretative notes\r\nof 1947 might be excused for believing that Nostradamus was the greatest\r\nprophet who had ever lived, or was ever likely to live. To the errors of a vitiated text are superadded those of a fanciful translation ; and both\r\nsets are, as it were, subsumed and glorified in a fantastic interpretation.\r\nIt is fatally easy to make a prediction fit the facts. In Mercure de France,\r\nof 15 December 1932, there was an amusing example, couched in that faint\r\nirony of which the French are masters, of how prophecies can be made to correspond with later events. The writer quotes a mediaeval prophecy to the effect that, if Christmas day falls on a Friday, children will die, there\r\nwill be battles between Christians, pilgrimages will come to a bad end, and\r\ngreat terrors will threaten princes, all in the following year. He points\r\nout that, in 193 1, Christmas day did in fact fall on a Friday, and that, in\r\n1932, infant mortality increased and President Doumer was assassinated.\r\nHe suggests that the fights between \" Christians \" may apply to the SouthAmerican war, and that the unfortunate fate of pilgrimages may, in modern\r\ntimes, find a counterpart in fatalities among pedestrians, caused by automobiles.\r\nIt is precisely this kind of reasoning of which Mr Roberts is guilty.\r\nSince the whole subject of precognition is still sub judice, we should do well\r\nto bear his technique in mind in our appraisal of dreams\u2014and statistics ; for the object of this review is to point a moral, where others have seen fit to adorn a tale. B. S.\r\n'Dr Mesmer. Nora Wydenbruck. London (Westhouse), 1947.\r\nA lively inaginative reconstruction of episodes in the career of the cele- brated Dr Mesmer, based on facts and written like a novel. It reminds us\r\nthat Mesmer was a brilliant pioneer in the art of cure by suggestion.\r\nAlthough not without failings, he was no charlatan but an enthusiast who\r\nsuftered for his convictions. It is hard for the psychical researcher to doubt\r\nthat in the course of his work Mesmer witnessed phenomena of a tvpe with\r\n1 68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN. 1948\r\nwhich we are familiar today. These led him to the conclusion, published\r\nin 1799 at the age of 65, that man possesses \" an interior sense which is in\r\nconnection with the whole of the universe and which might be considered\r\nas an extension of sight \", and that he is gifted with \" a sensitivity by which\r\nhe can be en rapport with the beings who surround him, even at great\r\ndistances ...\"\r\nMesmer's theories of animal magnetism and the universal fluid were\r\nformulated within the mental framework of his time and will be read with a smile by the scientist of today ; but they may be a useful reminder that\r\nattempts to bring the facts of psychical research within the mental framework created by rationalist dogma may cause equal amusement to the\r\nscientist of tomorrow. The book also reminds us of the fascinating question as to whether the remarkable cures of a Mesmer, a Coue or a psychic\r\nhealer are due solely to suggestion, or whether, as is claimed by some,\r\ntransference of an unknown factor can on occasion take place from specially\r\nendowed agents to their patients. * .\r\n\" R.

H. Salter, in the Chair. The Minutes of the last Meeting of the\r\nCouncil were read and signed as correct. Twenty new Members were\r\nelected ; their names and addresses are given above.\r\nMEETING OF THE SOCIETY\r\nThe 197th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Society's Rooms\r\non Thursday, 22 January 1948, at 6 p.m., when a paper on \" Hand-writing\r\nin Automatic Script \" was read by Mr James Leigh.\r\nEMERGENCE OF AN APPARENTLY PSEUDOCOMMUNICATOR\r\nWe are indebted to Mrs Frank Heywood for the following account of an\r\ninteresting sitting with Mrs Edith Thomson, a well-known trance medium.\r\nI arranged a sitting with Mrs Thomson on July 7th, 1947, in the hopes\r\nof getting information about a German friend, a Silesian landowner, of\r\nwhose fate I knew nothing. I thought it probable that a person of his\r\nintegrity had got into trouble with the Nazis or had been killed or deported\r\nby the Russians ; and the sitting might be useful evidentially if it produced\r\ninformation subsequently confirmed. Mrs Thomson did not know me\r\nand the only people in England who had any links with my friendship with\r\nthe German, eleven years ago in America, were my husband and my two\r\nsons, who were children at the time. Of the two other foreigners mentioned\r\nby Mrs Thomson during the sitting, I know nobody in England who has ever heard of one, and only one person, my family apart, of the other. Myfamily was away from London at the time of the sitting and did not know\r\nI was having it. Normal leakage seems incredible, and it is hard to imagine\r\nhow Mrs Thomson could have got the names she did otherwise than by\r\nE.S.P.\r\nThe sitting was a long one and I only took notes of salient points. The\r\nostensible control said that there were a young man and a girl present.\r\nThe young man was Robert and he had passed owing to chest trouble.\r\nHere the medium coughed painfully. I was not encouraging, for myfriend's name was not Robert, though like it\u2014I will call him Rupert\u2014and\r\nit was not until later that I remembered that a cousin of mine, called Robert,\r\nhad died of T.B. after being wounded in Libya. I had not thought of him\r\nfor a long time.\r\nThe medium soon began to talk as if Rupert himself were communicating directly and her remarks were reasonably in character. For instance\r\n\" Rupert \" said that at last he had time for contemplation. I had always\r\nlooked upon him as a natural contemplative. He talked about time as we\r\n176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research FEB. 1948\r\nknow it being an illusion. I had recently been pondering a good deal on\r\nthis subject. At one point the control interpolated, \" Robin \", in a tentative way. After more conversation I said, \" You must remember, Rupert,\r\nthat \/ cannot see you.'' This aroused a burst of most genuine-seeming\r\nemotion on the part of \" Rupert \", who said I had reminded him that it was not altogether himself talking to me. He was apparently so upset that\r\nthe control took over, saying that he must rest. The control then remarked\r\nthat I had a letter from \" Rupert \" in my bag, which was correct, for I had\r\nbrought, though not produced, an old letter, in case it might be psychometrically useful. It talked more about him, saying correctly that he was\r\ninterested in music and so on, and later that his passing had been swift.\r\nThen it said, \" The name is R\u2014there's a P\u2014Rupert,\" with no help whatever from me. After more transmission of remarks from \" Rupert \" the\r\ncontrol said, \" Stefan\u2014he might be called a rebel\u2014against tyranny.\r\nThat's what got him into trouble.\" This is an only too apt description of\r\na Hungarian- Italian friend of mine. His rebellion against tyranny got him\r\ninto Dachau. I know him as Istvan, but his Italian relations have written\r\nto me about him as Stefano. I had not heard from him for some weeks\r\nand he was not in my conscious mind.\r\nThe control then gave a description of \" Rupert's \" appearance which\r\nI did not recognise. He tried to laugh this off with another description,\r\nalso incorrect, and then suddenly asked me if I remembered our walks by\r\nthe river. At first I said \" No \", but a moment later I did remember that\r\nwe had been for many such walks by the Potomac. \" Rupert \" seemed\r\ndistressed that I did not remember and reminded me of walking the plank.\r\nThis was an apt allusion to- an occasion when \" Rupert\", a good mountaineer, had tried to persuade me to cross a high acqueduct, two bricks\r\nwide or thereabouts, over a frozen river, an incident far from my conscious\r\nmind. He then reminded me of the wall round my garden, to which I replied that there was no wall., \" Protection then,\" he said, which was also\r\napplicable in a particular way to the time I knew him, for I planted a hedge\r\nround my little garden in Washington, in which he took an interest. The\r\nhedge had caused quite a sensation, because Americans do not enclose their\r\ngardens. He also mentioned having spilt something on my carpet. This\r\nI could not and cannot remember. He added that it did not seem much\r\ngood trying to produce evidence if I did not remember anything.\r\nSuddenly, apropos of nothing, the control said, \" How is Poppet? \" This had no meaning for me until I remembered, but did not say, that I sometimes laughingly call my husband, \" Poppet \". Shortly afterwards\r\nthe control said, with evident satisfaction, \" Frank is Poppet.\" I had mentioned my husband earlier, as this gave away nothing not easily known to Mrs\r\nThomson had she previously done any detective work about me. I had\r\nnot mentioned \" Poppet \"; the casual joke could not have been further\r\nfrom my conscious mind. A little later the control said, gropingly \" Grace \u2014Cicely\u2014Natalie.\" To arrive at Natalie was a surprise to me, for it was\r\nthe name of an American friend, killed in an aircrash in 1937, known to none of my friends in England, except my husband, and of whom I had\r\nscarcely thought for years. Rupert had known her and the control said\r\nshe was the girl \" Rupert \" was with.\r\nAfter a little more talk about the horror of war, how \" Rupert \" felt after\r\nFEB. 1948 Correspondence 177\r\nhis death and so on, the control said, \" P\u2014that's the surname.\" Rupert's surname does begin with P. Later the control said that he seemed to have\r\ndied further away than Europe, which did not surprise me as I feared he\r\nmight have been deported to Siberia.\r\nAfter the sitting I had a chat with Mrs Thomson, who seemed to be a person of real integrity and to have no conscious knowledge of what had\r\ntaken place at it. Some time before, I had set going enquiries through the Control Commission in Berlin and other sources as to Rupert's fate, but had been told\r\nthat there was no trace of him. Some weeks after I heard that he had been\r\ntraced to a neutral country, having escaped both Nazis and Russians, and\r\nthat he was happily married. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the\r\nmedium, while in trance, built up a communicator from genuine telepathic\r\ninformation from my mind : some of it was what I consciouslv feared\r\nmight have happened, but more, such as the correct names and facts\u2014\u2022\r\nRobert, who had died of T.B. ; Natalie ; Stefan the rebel ; Poppet, and\r\nso on\u2014were in my subconscious mind. None of these was in anv way\r\ngiven away to the medium by anything I said or did.\r\nIf Rupert had in fact died and I had received information of his death\r\nsubsequently to the sitting, I should have had to assess it as without watertight evidence of survival, but as containing :\r\n{a) A fair amount of evidence of character.\r\n{b) A knowledge of past events.\r\n(<-) An account of Rupert's reactions to the war and after death in\r\nkeeping with what I should have expected of him. (These are not given above.)\r\n{d) Attempts to give evidence of identity.\r\nReflection on the sitting in the light of subsequent knowledge suggests\r\nthat the ostensible control was skilfully using a much-practised technique\r\nin building up the desired character, and particularly in providing items\r\npopular with sitters, from telepathic clues. I had the curious impression\r\nthat the control, whoever or whatever it may have been, was itself con- vinced of the authenticity of \" Rupert \", its own apparent creation.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nBoRLEY Rectory\r\nDear Sir,\u2014Was Borley Rectory the most haunted house in England?\r\nThe recent reprint of The End of Borley Rectory raises the question once\r\nagain and, as it seems to me, an unfavourable answer must be given.\r\nMr Price's two books The Most Haunted House in England and The End\r\nof Borley Rectory are not serious contributions to the subject of haunting.\r\nThey are written in a popular style in the tradition of the best ghost stories. One has only to look at the chapter headings to realise this : \"A Night of\r\nMiracles \", \" ' Moving Day ' and a Golden Apport \", \" The Enchanted\r\n178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research FEB. 1948\r\n' Tea Garden \"', \" ' Truth ' at the Bottom of a Well? \", etc. ' One does\r\nnot expect accuracy of statement with such a style and neither does one\r\nfind it. Here are a few criticisms among many which could be made.\r\nThe' observers. Most of the observers nominated by Mr Price were\r\nunacquainted with psychical research. He appears to consider this desirable for he writes, \" I wanted independent evidence from intelligent, competent, and cultured strangers who were not spiritualists ; and if they knew\r\nnothing about psychical research, so much the better.\" There may have\r\nbeen something to say for this attitude sixty or seventy years ago when to\r\nshow any interest in this subject might have rendered one suspect. At the\r\npresent time, however, when psychical research is recognised at Universities both in England and America such an attitude is out of date. One has\r\nonly to think of the outcry there would be if the opportunity of investigating some rare phenomena in any other subject was thrown away by inviting \" cultured strangers \" to investigate instead of those who had studied the\r\nsubject. It is to be hoped that other investigators will not follow Mr\r\nPrice's example in this matter.\r\nThe phantom nun. The principal witnesses to the appearance of the\r\n\" nun \" were the Misses Bull and a carpenter named Cartwright. No\r\nattempt, however, appears to have been made to have obtained signed\r\nstatements from them or even to give the reader a verbatim report of what\r\nthey said. In the case of the Misses Bull, Mr Price states that his account \" is a composite report, from notes, composed from information given to my\r\nsecretary and me on June 13, 1929 ; from another interview, over a cup of\r\ntea, that Mr Sidney H. Glanville and I had with the ladies on Wednesday,\r\nMarch 29, 1939 ; and from notes that Mr Glanville made when he met\r\nMiss Ethel Bull and her sister at Pinner on June 25, 1938.\"\r\nIn estimating the value of the evidence given by Miss Ethel Bull it must\r\nbe remembered that she also told Mr Price that some of the coffins in the\r\ncrypt of Borley Church had several times been mysteriously moved from\r\ntheir prescribed positions. Investigations, however, carried out in 1943\r\nwith the help of the Rector and a firm of masons failed to reveal any trace of a crypt.\r\nMr Cartwright's account of how he saw the \" nun \" four times in two\r\nweeks was obtained \" over a pint of ale at the ' White Horse '.\" W^ere the Misses Bull and Mr Cartwright ever given the opportunity of\r\napproving the summary which Mr Price has given of their accounts.' We\r\nare not told, but in any case stories obtained \" over a cup of tea \" and\r\n\" over a pint of ale \" can hardly be taken seriously.\r\nThe wall messages. These were messages, partly incoherent, which\r\nappeared written on the walls during the tenancy of the Rev. and Mrs\r\nFoyster. No one saw them appear and no one admitted to having written\r\nthem. It was therefore assumed that they had been supernormally produced. Surely rather inadequate grounds for such an assumption!\r\nThese wall messages are not, of course, unique in the annals of psychical research. Similar phenomena were recorded in \" The Great\r\nAmherst Mystery \" when \" Esther Cox you are mine to kill \" was once\r\ninscribed on one of the walls. Dr Prince, however, after a lengthy study\r\nof the case {Proceedings American S.P.R., Vol. XIII, pages 89 to 130)\r\nFEB. 1948 Correspotidence 179\r\nshowed that they were written by Esther Cox herself, unknowingly, while\r\nin a state of dissociation.\r\nPossibly the Borley messages were written by Mrs Foyster while in a\r\nsimilar state of dissociation. She was in poor health,\u2014several times we\r\nare told she was ill in bed and once collapsed for no apparent reason in the arms of Dom Richard Whitehouse,\u2014and the curious way she had of\r\ndotting the i in her christian name by means of a downward dash instead of\r\na dot is reproduced in the photograph of the wall message beginning\r\n\" Marianne at get help. . . .\" This photograph also shows Mrs Foyster's\r\nnormal handwriting.\r\nMr Price states that the wall markings continued to appear after the\r\nFoysters had left and during the period his obser\\ ers were in the house.\r\nThese markings, however, were nothing like the messages, being mainly\r\nfaint \" squiggles \". As each \" squiggle \" was found it was ringed with\r\nchalk and dated. There is, however, nothing to prove that it was not there\r\nall the time but unnoticed in spite of some observers being practically\r\ncertain it was not there during a previous search. Faint \" squiggles \"\r\nunnoticeable with the light in one direction may become apparent both\r\nvisually and photographically at another period of the day when the light comes from a different angle.\r\nMr Price microscopically examined some of the material with which the\r\n\" Marianne \" messages were written and found it was indistinguishable\r\nfrom pencil lead. Did he examine the \" squiggles \" in like manner or were they merely slight cracks in the plaster?\r\nPossibly some of Mr Price's observers were not above pulling his leg.\r\nThe disadvantage of employing even \" cultured strangers \" becomes painfully apparent when one is asked to accept on their word phenomena which\r\nare contrary to all normal experience.\r\nThe seances. Mediums of proved ability might have had something\r\ninteresting to say about the Borley haunting, but during Mr Price's many\r\nyears of investigation he does not mention having asked even one well\r\nknown medium to visit the Rectory. Instead, many pages are devoted to recording in detail inexperienced attempts at table turning at which answers\r\ngenerally only \" Yes \" or \" No \" were given to leading questions. It is hardly necessary to say that when table-turning phenomena are so weak\r\nsupernormal information is not to be expected. Even Mr Price admits\r\nthat much of the information is contradictory, yet it is on such data to- gether with some equally unsatisfactory planchette messages that the\r\nphantom \" nun \" is identified as the \" Marie Lairre \" of the seance messages and a highly improbable story of intrigue and murder is evolved..\r\nThis makes exciting reading but there is no reason to suppose that it corres- ponds in any way with the real history of Borley.\r\nProbably the most important planchette message was that recorded by\r\nMr Price in Chapter 27 of The Most Haunted House in England. He\r\nwrites, \" One startling piece of information or prediction\u2014fulfilled to the\r\nletter\r\n\r\nwas obtained at a planchette seance at Streatham.\" This message was obtained on March 27, 1938, and the relevant part was as follows : \" Sunex Amures and one of his men (indistinct) mean to burn the\r\nRECTORY tonight at 9 o'clock end of the haunting. . . .\" Later it was asked,. \" In which room will the fire start.^\" \" and answered, \" Over the hall.\" .\u2022\r\ni8o Journal of Society for Psychical Research FEB. 1948\r\nIn actual fact the fire was not caused supernormally but by a pile of books\r\nwhich Capt. Gregson was dusting falHng on to a lamp and upsetting it, the\r\nfire did not occur on March 27th at 9 o'clock but February 27th at midnight and the haunting did not end with the fire but according to reports\r\ncontinued long after it. Also the lamp was overturned in the main hall and consequently the fire must have started there and not in the room over\r\nthe hall. If this is what M\u00bbPrice calls a literal fulfilment, of what value are his\r\nother statements which cannot be checked by the reader?\r\nIt is, of course, a difficult matter to investigate h haunted house and it is easy to criticise. These criticisms, however, are only put forward in the\r\nhope that they will be adequately answered and the case strengthened for\r\ntaking the Borley haunting seriously.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\u2022 \u2022 B. NiSBET.\r\nThe Alleged Thermal Phenomenon at Borley\r\nDear Sir,\u2014\" Visit 14 \" in the report of the Cambridge Commission on\r\nBorley included a series of readings taken from two thermometers, which on first scrutiny seemed quantitative e^idence for the existence of a \" cold\r\nspot \". The arrangement was as follows : Thermometer A was secured\r\nin a test tube by means of a rubber stopper \" and placed as far as possible on the cold spot \". (This had been reconstructed after the fire, by laying a plank from wall to wall.) Thermometer B was \" freely exposed \" the\r\nbulb \" resting on the wood \". Readings were taken between i.oo a.m. and 3.00 a.m. at ten minute intervals, and while thermometer 5 remained\r\nsteady at 65-1\u00b0 F., thermometer A fell from 60-2\u00b0 to 54-0\u00b0 F., a fall (including the original discrepancy) of ii-i\u00b0. The conclusion was that\r\nheat was being selectively withdrawn from the region im.mediately sur- rounding the enclosed thermometer\u2014an attractive proposition in the light\r\nof the \" heat to energy \" theory of poltergeist manifestations.\r\nI was struck, however, by the fact that the figures gave no indication of\r\nthe changes which had given rise to the initial difference of 4-9\u00b0 F. There\r\nwere two possibilities. Either the process of selective heat withdrawal had\r\nalready been manifesting itself, or cooling was taking place at a different rate above and below the plank. In the latter case, it seemed probable that\r\nthe surface temperature of the wood might be affecting the reading of\r\nthermometer B. Since the day temperature of the air and consequently\r\nthat of the wood was no doubt higher than 65-1\u00b0, cooling at the surface\r\nwould result in heat being conducted from the centre of the plank to the\r\nsurface. It was conceivable, therefore, that a point would be reached\r\nwhere the rate of withdrawal of heat from the surface due to the falling air temperature was just equal to the amount of heat being conducted to the\r\nsurface from the warmer interior. At this point the thermometer B\r\nwould remain steady, but thermometer A would continue to fall. In order to verify this hypothesis, I attempted as far as possible to recreate the conditions in the laboratory. An enclosed thermometer and\r\nanother resting on a block of wood 2\" x 2\" were set up in a reasonably\r\ndraught-proof situation. The air temperature was 58-0\u00b0 F.

The block was heated separately, the surface\r\ntemperature being 65-0\u00b0 and the internal temperature 67\u00b0. Readings were\r\nthen taken at five minute intervals and the results graphed as shown.\r\nFrom this it can be seen that a series of readings taken over a period ABwould approximate to the Borley \" phenomenon \". The duration of this state of equilibrium would, of course, be determined by the rate of cooling\r\nof the air, but might well last over two hours. A quantitative proof would\r\nrequire the equating of the rate of heat removal at the surface with the rate of conduction in the block. One would require to know however, how far the thermometer on the wood was afiected by the surface temperature.\r\nI think, however, that clearly this is, regretfully enough, the true explanation of the phenomenon.\r\nAllen J. Sharp.\r\nSir, \u2014In connection with the Research Officer's remarks on Mr Ballard\r\nThomas's dream, it may be of interest to point out that J. W. Dunne, in\r\nAn Experiment witJi Time, suggested that the deja vu sensation might be due\r\nto precognition.\r\nA graduated series can be traced. First there is the fully-remembered\r\nprecognitive dream ; next come cases like Mr Ballard Thomas's, in which\r\nforgotten details of the dream are recalled by the event ; then others like those of Hone and Shelley (quoted by Andrew Lang in Dreams and\r\nGhosts) in which the very existence of the dream is forgotten until the\r\nevent occurs. Finally, in the typical deja vu experience there is no memory\r\nof a dream at all ; but the other cases suggest that there may have been a dream for all that.\r\nI do not suggest, however, that this explanation applies to all cases. In\r\nthe few instances in which I have experienced the deja vu sensation, it has\r\nusually been immediately preceded by a period of abstraction. The\r\nprecognition may have occurred during this period.\r\nFinally, there are cases in which the sensation continues for long periods.\r\nThese seem to be pathological ; but even here it is as difficult to prove that\r\nthe feeling is an illusion as to prove that it is due to precognition.\r\nMr Eric Cuddon's case, reported in the same number of the Journal, is of a type closely allied to deja vu and almost equally common. It occurs\r\nin two forms : (i) The subject is walking along the street, thinking of\r\nnothing in particular, when the thought of his friend X comes into his\r\nhead ; soon afterwards he meets X. (2) Without any previous thought of\r\nX, he looks up and sees him walking towards him. A moment later he\r\nrealises that it is not X at all but a total stranger, only vaguely like him.\r\nHe walks on, and meets the real X round the next corner. Remove the stranger who acted as a poitit de repere in the second form,\r\nand you have a full-blown doppelganger hallucination ; but this is of course much rarer. Yours faithfully,\r\nG. F. Dalton.\r\nFEB. 1948 Review \" 183\r\nREVIEW\r\nThe Reach of the Mind. By J. B. Rhine. (Published by William Sloane\r\nAssociates, Inc., New York, 1947.)\r\nIt is not easy to write entertainingly about statistical experiments in\r\nextra-sensory cognition or psychokinesis unless one has a theory to ex- pound, in which case, as in Mr Carington's Telepathy, one can pack a rather dull summary of the card-guessing and dice-throwing results into a few preliminary pages and then proceed to the theory and its more picturesque implications. So far as I can judge Dr Rhine has no theory\r\nwhich covers the field of psychical phenomena, but in spite of this handicap\r\nhe has written a very interesting book. The aim, apparently, is to provide\r\nthe intelligent but non-technical reader with a fairly complete survey of the\r\nresearch into Clairvoyance, Precognition, Telepathy and Psychokinesis\r\nthat has been carried out at Duke University and elsewhere since about\r\nthe year 1932. Considered as a piece of exposition the book is a great\r\nadvance on New Frontiers of the Mind and the last three chapters on the\r\nimplications of the research are I think the best in the book.\r\nIt is of course extremely difficult for an Englishman who has had no\r\npersonal contact with any of the experimenters or witnessed any of the\r\nexperiments to form a sound estimate of the true value of the vast volume\r\nof research that has been turned out by Duke Univeristy and other U.S.A.\r\ninstitutions during the past fifteen years.\r\nThe precautions taken, as described in a report, may sound impressive\r\nbut vital details may have been suppressed which, had they been mentioned,\r\nmight reveal only too clearly loop-holes for fraud on the part of someone\r\nconcerned in the tests. We do know that positive results in card-guessing\r\nand dice-throwing have been reported in America on a scale for which\r\nthere is no parallel in this country. Apart from one or two borderline cases, the only persons in England who have obtained positive results in cardguessing (or a similar technique) under reasonably good conditions are Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell and myself. A considerable number of young men\r\nboth in London and Cambridge have been experimenting assiduously for\r\nmonths and years without a gleam of success. It can hardly be that they\r\nare all \" bad experimenters \". If the American claims are all genuine we\r\nshould be forced to assume that the psychic faculty is extremely rare in\r\nEngland compared with America.\r\nLet us look at a few of these American claims. It is reported that Miss\r\nMargaret Pegram and a Miss Price tested the inmates of a school for the\r\nblind and found that \" about one out of every three of the inmates scored\r\nsignificantly above chance \"\r\n(p. 137). Is this really credible? It is further\r\nreported that this same Miss Pegram watched a little girl called Lillian\r\nachieve a perfect score of 25 correct hits with a pack of Zener cards (p. 147). We are told also that Miss Pegram was the first person outside of Duke\r\nUniversity to obtain positive results in the dice-throwing experiments\r\n(p. 102). Miss Pegram must be a very remarkable person. . .\r\n184 ' Journal of Society for Psychical Research FEB. 1948\r\nDr Rhine makes no less than seven references to the unwitnessed experiments of B. F. Riess with a girl whose name is not even given and whose\r\nwhereabouts does not seem to be known. According to Riess this girl,\r\nsitting in a house a quarter of a mile away, guessed 20 cards right out of 25\r\nand performed this feat over a score of times. Her average per 25 was i&\r\nover a series of 74 runs. Then we are told she had a nervous breakdown, was treated for hyperthyroidism, lost her powers completely and disappeared into the unknown.\r\nI can find no mention of the telepathic horse which pranced in the pages\r\nof Extra-Sensory Perception.\r\nThe unfortunate effect which these and similar stories have upon\r\nBritish psychologists and men of science is to make them suspicious of the\r\nwhole American bag of tricks. This is a pity, for I feel convinced that some\r\nof the work in extra-sensory perception done at Duke Univeristy under\r\nDr Rhine and at Columbia under Dr Gardner Murphy is essentially sound\r\nand of real importance.\r\nIt cannot however be denied that at Duke University there has been a\r\nradical change in the experimental situation since 1934. Round about that\r\nyear Dr Rhine reported on the feats of numerous high-scoring subjects, all discovered apparently within the narrow precincts of Duke University.\r\nIf these subjects have petered out, surely in thirteen years similar individuals ought to have been forthcoming? Where are the successors of Miss\r\nMay Turner who, in a telepathy experiment at a distance of 250 miles from\r\nMiss Ounbey, the agent, obtained scores of 19, 16, 16 ; of Hubert Pearce,\r\nwho made not only an average of 9 hits per run over 30 runs but who also\r\nachieved a \" perfect score \" of 25 correct hits in 25 trials ; of Unzmayer,\r\nwho reached a score of 18, and the rest.'' For many years now the Duke University E.S.P. investigations have\r\nbeen carried out with groups of apparently quite ordinary or unselected\r\npersons. But even these groups in America behave differently from the\r\ngroups investigated by English experimenters who generally obtain only\r\nchance results. Nearly all the card-guessing experiments with groups at Duke University or the City of New York Colleges produce some sort of\r\npositive result even if the odds against chance are only 100 to i. These extraordinary discrepancies between conditions in this country^\r\nand America are causing serious disquiet among the younger members of\r\nthe Society for Psychical Research who are asking why it is they are unable\r\nto obtain these wonderful results. They are asking whether the remarkable feats described in Extra-Sensory Perception were due in part to the\r\ngeneral slackness of experimental conditions which prevailed around 1934\r\nand which may have allowed some subjects to learn the cards from their\r\nbacks and others to practise deliberate fraud.\r\nThe three most remarkable chapters in Dr Rhine's book are devoted to the Psychokinesis (P.K.) experiments which appear to have originated in\r\nRhine's own family. As everyone knows, the experiments claim that\r\ncertain persons by a mere act of will can overcome the inertia of a falling\r\ndie and cause it to land with an assigned face upwards more often than,\r\nchance would predict. The mysterious force exerted on the die during its\r\nfall is, Dr Rhine emphatically avers, a non-physical force. It is noti- physical and yet acts on matter\u2014which sounds a contradiction of terms.\r\nFEB. 1948 Review\r\nIt does not obey the laws of mechanics and yet, in order to produce the\r\neffects it does, it must initiate changes in the angular momentum of the die\r\nat definite points in space and time. Further, it must be under the control\r\nof some intelligence\u2014an intelligence that must be capable of performing\r\nthe most elaborate calculations in an interval of about half a second or less. Unlike any other force of which we have any experience it is more successful in influencing 96 dice thrown together than a single die. It has more\r\neffect on heavy metal dice than light wooden ones. It will sometimes produce stronger effects when the operator stands 25 feet away from the\r\nfalling die than when he is quite close to it. And yet though the force\r\npossesses all these extraordinary properties it seems -incapable of moving a\r\ndelicately suspended needle or of influencing any delicate physical instrument. Apparently it can only be registered by some dubious and obscure\r\nstatistical effects observed when a die is clumsily shaken in a cup or allowed\r\nto fall in a rotating cage.\r\nMoreover, Dr Rhine's telekinesis appears to be of a totally different\r\nvariety from that observed, say, with Rudi Schneider. Where are the tele- plastic structures reported by all the earlier investigators? Where are the\r\n\" mushroom-headed cantilevers \" of Crawford \" packed with matter in a form unknown to science \"? Where is the \" emanation \" of Osty that\r\ninterfered with a beam of infra-red rays? Are there no teleplastic \" fingers '\\ pinching the die in mid-air that Dr Rhine can photograph ? How is it that\r\ndarkness is not necessary to obtain the phenomenon?\r\nUntil Dr Rhine provides a satisfactory answer to these enquiries I am\r\nafraid that for most men of science, as for the present reviewer, psychokinesis a la Rhine will remain res addiibitate\r\n.\r\nDr Rhine's account of the criticism which E.S.P. research in America\r\nhas had to meet and overcome makes rather ludicrous reading. There was,\r\nfirst, he tells us the \" mathematical criticism \" followed by the \" criticism\r\nof experimental methods \". Neither ought ever to have arisen. When I commenced my own experiments in ^934 it was perfectly obvious to me\r\nthat in order to apply the Binomial distribution formulae I must first of all obtain a mathematically random sequence of card symbols. It was equally\r\nobvious that experiments in which the guesser had the slightest opportunity\r\nfor\r\n'\r\n' learning ' ' the cards from their backs or edges were of no value whatever.\r\nYet, strange to say, the Duke experimenters seem to have fallen into pitfalls\r\nthat an intelligent schoolboy would have avoided. Cards which could be\r\nidentified by the impressions showing through the backs, others in which\r\nthere were variations in the design at the edges, packs of cards in which the\r\n\" rectangle \" cards were cut to a different size from the rest\u2014some of these\r\nthings Dr Rhine plausibly tries to explain away in the present book, but for\r\nthose who know something of the actual facts his explanations do not cut\r\nmuch ice. The book is in fact Dr Rhine's version of the development of the E.S.P.\r\ncult in America. Whether we in England will ever be given a different\r\nversion I do not know, but Dr Rhine's book certainly merits the word\r\n\" remarkable \" in more senses than one.\r\nS. G.

J. West\r\nIn 1890, when the Society carried out a large-scale Census of Hallucinations, the investigators came to the surprising conclusion that ten per cent\r\nof those questioned had at some time in their lives experienced at least one hallucination not accounted for by illness, intoxication, or any of the\r\ncommonly recognised causes. In other words it would seem that, contrary\r\nto popular belief, sporadic hallucinations were quite common to ordinary\r\npeople in a normal state of health. This finding was of interest to psychical\r\nresearchers, because it is among cases of hallucinations of the sane that one must search for the so-called veridical experiences, those thoughts\r\nwhich come to the mind from outside through the agency of telepathy or other paranormal processes. In fact, the Census investigators quoted\r\nfrom among their cases scores of examples of apparently paranormal\r\nhallucinations.\r\nCircumstances have changed since 1890. There have been many\r\nreferences in the S.P.R. Journal to the fact that nowadays cases of\r\napparitions or other kinds of veridical hallucination are reported far less frequently. It has been suggested that the increased tempo of life, and\r\nthe material preoccupations of the present age, are inimical to such\r\nexperiences. The question has been asked whether, if another Census\r\nwere undertaken today, we would find as many people reporting\r\nhallucinations.\r\nThe present investigation, while in no sense a repetition in kind or in magnitude of the 1890 Census, was intended to explore this question.\r\nThe Society were fortunate in securing the co-operation of \" MassObservation \", an organisation which has carried out many questionnaire\r\ninvestigations. It provides a national panel of voluntary helpers, who\r\n1 88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nassist by answering and getting their friends to answer questionnaire forms\r\nsent to them by post. In this case all members of the panel were asked to answer the same questions as had been put in the 1890 Census.\r\nIt is not suggested that this panel is a random selection from the whole\r\npopulation. Obviously people with leisure, intellectual inclinations, and\r\nan interest in social questions, will be in a majority. However, the\r\nprevious Census was carried out among a substantially similar class of\r\npeople, so purely for comparative purposes the panel might be preferable\r\nto a random sample ; but one must always bear in mind the possibility\r\nthat, if the rather more stolid labouring classes had been proportionately\r\nrepresented, there might have been a reduction in the number of\r\nhallucinations reported.\r\nThe average age of the people replying to the present questionnaire was very close to the 1890 figure.\r\nThe questionnaire form as sent out to the panel is reproduced below :\r\n\u2022 Directive for October\/November, 1947\r\nSpecial Job\r\nI . Have you ever, when believing yourself to be completely awake, had\r\na vivid impression of seeing or being touched by a living being or inanimate\r\nobject, or of hearing a voice ; which impression, so far as you could\r\ndiscover, was not due to any external physical cause?\r\nIf you have had any hallucination, would you please answer the following\r\nquestions and then describe the experience in your own way asfully as possible.\r\n(a) Did the hallucination take the form of\r\n:\r\ni. Something seen\r\nii. Something heard\r\niii. Something touching you\r\n. iv. Some other kind of experience.\r\n(b) If something v\/as seen, was it a human figure? If so, was it someone you recognised?\r\n(c) If something was heard, was it a human voice? If so, did you\r\nrecognise the voice?\r\n(d) If the hallucination took the form of the appearance or voice of someone known to you, did anything happen to this person about the\r\ntime of your experience ?\r\n(e) When did the experience occur? How many months or years ago?\r\n(\/) Have you had more than one hallucination? If so, how many?'\r\nIf you have had more than one, please answer the questions separately\r\nfor each case. If you have had more than three, please describe only the\r\nlast three that you can remember.\r\nFifty years ago a Census of Hallucinations was carried out by the\r\nSociety of Psychical Research asking the questions above; to a sample\r\nthat was apparently very similar to that of our present Panel. We are now working with them in an attempt to bring this up ,to date. The\r\nsurvey is of particular interest to us as the first comparative question that\r\nwe have been able to ask covering such a long period.\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Questionnaire on Hallucinations 189\r\nThe question is not dissimilar to one that we asked about a year ago.\r\nIf, in answering that, some of you described any personal experiences,\r\nplease repeat them in as much detail as possible. We are sorry about this\r\nrepetition but feel strongly that it is necessary.\r\nPlease answer this question on a separate piece of paper from the\r\nremainder of the Directive answers. It is MOST IMPORTANT that if you have never had anything in the nature of an hallucination, you should\r\nstill put your name or index number on a sheet of paper and write simply\r\n\" No \". The negative results of this survey are as important as the\r\npositive ones. The results of this survey will be summarised by the Society for\r\nPsychical Research and everybody who replies\u2014even in the negative\r\n\r\nwill receive a copy of this summary.\r\n2. Will you please ask three of your friends at random this question\r\nand get them to WRITE DOWN their replies, putting at the top of the\r\nsheet simply their sex, approximate age, and their occupation?\r\nOnce again it is MOST IMPORTANT that negative replies should be\r\nsent in in exactly the same way as positive ones.\r\nIn the original Census, people were interviewed viva voce by collectors\r\nappointed for the purpose. Consequently doubtful matters could be\r\nexplained directly and necessary details obtained on the spot. This\r\nquestionnaire depended entirely on answers sent by post. The MassObservation officials thought that the instructions were clear enough for\r\nmost people to follow without difficulty. In point of fact, although the\r\nmajority of correspondents appeared to get the right idea, there were very\r\nmany misunderstandings which detracted greatly from the accuracy of\r\nthe result. It would seem from this exploratory investigation that an unsupplemented questionnaire is unsuitable for obtaining information\r\nabout hallucinations, upon which topic many people's ideas are confused\r\nand misconceptions are frequent.^\r\nThe most important mistake which people made was in seeking only\r\npositive replies. In spite of statements explaining that negative replies were equally important, one kept coming across such comments as : \" The only person I could find who had had any experience of the kind was . . . etc.\" Other people thought we were only interested in definitely\r\nsupernormal experiences, and returned accounts of seances, dreams,\r\npremonitions and the like, without reference to hallucinations. A few\r\npeople took a strong dislike to the word \"hallucination \", and regarded\r\nthe question as almost insulting.\r\nThere were so many borderline cases that it proved a difficult matter\r\nto decide how many people had actually had an hallucination. Even\r\nwhen the answer was definitely in the affirmative, the details supplied\r\nsometimes cast doubt upon the matter. Some cases were clearly nothing more than dreams, fanciful imaginings, mental impressions or illusions. Arbitrary decisions had to be made occasionally, but the rules laid down\r\nin the previous Census were followed as far as possible. For instance, all\r\nThese drawbacks are inherent in the method. They cast no reflection upon\r\nMass-Observation who conducted the inquiry with admirable care and\r\nthoroughness.\r\n190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\ndreams and experiences when percipients were not fully awake, whether\r\nveridical or not, were excluded. So were any hallucinations resulting\r\nfrom drugs, anaesthetics, delirium or coma.

Moods and emotions, feelings of\r\n\" evil \" and of \" a presence \" were not regarded as hallucinations. The\r\n^ We are greatly indebted to Mr J. Fraser Nicol, a member of the Society, for\r\nhis able assistance in listing and classifying the material from which the tables in\r\nthis paper were prepared.\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Questionnaire on Hallucinations 191\r\nfrequently reported sensation of having lived through a situation before\r\n(the well-known illusion of deja vu) was also excluded.\r\nOn this basis it was estimated that out of 1,519 who replied, about 217, or 14-3 per cent, had experienced one or more hallucinations. In the 1890\r\nCensus out of 17,000 people, 1,684 9\"9 P^i\" ^^^^ had had hallucinations.\r\nWe see at once that there is no evidence for the suggestion that the\r\nfrequency of hallucinations is declining. In fact the percentage is higher\r\nnow than it was in 1890. This discrepancy is probably spurious, due\r\nmainly to the marked tendency to select positive answers. Another factor\r\nmay have tended to exaggerate the percentage in the present instance : the investigation being conducted entirely by correspondence, there was\r\nnot the same opportunity to clear up doubtful points. The probability\r\nis that many more borderland cases would have been rejected had further\r\ndetails been forthcoming. Moreover, on looking through the cases a second time, it seems that in the present count borderland cases were\r\ntreated more leniently and included more readily than in the 1890\r\ninvestigation.\r\nApart from the high percentage of affirmative replies, there were other\r\ngood reasons for concluding that people had not changed much in their\r\nliability to hallucinations. Consider the following table (I), in which\r\nthe hallucinations are classified according to what is seen or felt. The\r\nfigures of the present investigation are arranged side by side with those\r\nfrom the old Census, and the close similarity is at once apparent. In\r\nboth cases most of the hallucinations took the form of a realistic human\r\npresence or phantasm. Of these, the majority were \" seen \" as human\r\nfigures, although there were a good many that were only \" heard \" as voices. Contrary to what one might expect from the popular belief that\r\nphantasms are spirits of the dead, the majority were of living people.\r\nNon-human phantoms, religious fantasies, and visions depicting complete\r\nscenes were all quite rare.\r\nTable II\r\n(Classification a-ccording to senses affected)\r\nDate of\r\nInvesti- gation\r\nVisual\r\nVisual combined with\r\nauditory a?idl or tactile\r\nAuditory\r\n(vocal) Tactile\r\nAuditory\r\nand\r\ntactile\r\nNo. of Cases\r\nsufficietitly described for\r\nclassification\r\n1948\r\n(48-0%)\r\n27\r\n(8-4%)\r\n102\r\n(317%)\r\n33\r\n(io-3%)\r\n5\r\n.(1-6%)\r\n321\r\n(100%)\r\n1890\r\n1053\r\n(54-8%)\r\n222\r\n(\"6%)\r\n493\r\n(25-6%)\r\n137\r\n(7-1%)\r\n17\r\n(0-9%\r\n1922\r\n(100%)\r\nIn Table II the hallucinations are classified differently, this time\r\naccording to the sense or senses affected. Smells and unaccompanied\r\nnon-vocal noises do not figure in the table, because they were excluded\r\nfrom the count. Again the similarity between the present percentages\r\n192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nand those in the 1890 Census is very great. Over half were mainly visual,\r\nrather less than a third vocal. In only ten per cent of cases was more than one sense affected, that is the phantasms were usually either seen or heard,\r\nbut not both. One slight difference between the results of the two\r\ninvestigations was in the proportion of people who said they had had more than one hallucination. In 1890 it was 25-4 per cent, in 1948 it was 38-7 per cent. A possible factor contributing to this difference was\r\nthat borderland cases were often of the multiple variety, and as the 1890\r\ninvestigators had been rather more strict in excluding doubtful cases, they might have rejected a higher proportion of multiple cases. Here is a fairly typical case taken from the replies : Female. Age 36. Laboratory stezvard.\r\n(a) Som.ething seen.\r\n(b) A human figure, recognised.\r\n(c) -\r\n(d) No [correspondence with any particular event].\r\n(e) [It took place] about five years [ago].\r\n(\/) No, not more than one [hallucination]. \" The experience occurred about five years ago, and is the only one\r\nI have had which could be counted as a genuine hallucination, though I have had various ' odd ' telepathic experiences.\r\n\" I awoke sometime during the night, and felt that som^eone was near me\u2014I think a slight movement, a breath or a rustle, may have wakened\r\nme\u2014and when I opened my eyes I saw a small woman leaning over me\r\nlooking into my face. I sat up in bed in a fright, and she drew back and\r\nv\/alked quickly down to the foot of the bed, where she was hidden from\r\nview. It was a moonlit night and light enough for me to see her. The\r\nodd thing was, that I knew quite certainly that the woman was my grandma,\r\nthough she did not look very much like my remembrance of her ; her\r\nbuild, general shape and size and movement, were the same, but she\r\nlooked a good deal younger than she had done during the time I knew\r\nher. Slie had died a couple of years previously at the age of ninety, and\r\nI had had no particular reason to remember her on that night. My\r\ngeneral impression was of a lively curiosity on her part, which would fit in very well with her general attitude in life.\" In this particular example, the phantom was associated with a dead\r\nwoman, and consequently might be interpreted by some people as a spirit\r\nvisitation, but this was not a feature of the m.ajority of the cases. Points\r\nto notice are that it was an isolated hallucination occurring spontaneously\r\nwithout any known cause or expectation, and recognised afterwards by\r\nthe percipient as a subjective experience. These characteristics contrast\r\nmarkedly with the hallucinations of psychosis, which are as a rule multiple\r\nand in which the patient often lacks the insight to realise the subjective\r\nnature of the experience, attributing it instead to some delusory external\r\ncause, such as waves of wireless or telepathy acting from a distance. The\r\nexample quoted, in common with nearly all the hallucinations reported\r\nby sane persons, lacks the personal element found in most psychotic\r\nhallucinations. The phantom appears as something casual and unrelated\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Questionnaire on Hallucinations 193\r\nto the percipient's personal life ; whereas in psychotics the hallucination\r\nis usually a vehicle of delusory ideas or complexes characteristic of the\r\npsychology of the individual patient.\r\nOne fact which emerged very clearly from the figures was that there was a marked difference between the sexes in respect of the frequency of\r\nreported hallucinations. Consider the following table (HI).\r\nTable III\u20141948 Questionnaire\r\nNo. of persons claiming to have\r\nhad an hallucination.\r\nMale Female Unspecified Total\r\n72\r\n(112-92)\r\n138\r\n(97-08)\r\n7 217\r\nNo. of persons claiming not to have had an hallucination.\r\n655\r\n(614-08)\r\n487\r\n(527-92)\r\n160 1,302\r\nTotal 727 625 167 1-519\r\nOf those persons who had not had an hallucination the majority were\r\nmale. Of those who had had hallucinations there were nearly twice as many women as men. Statistically the difference is unquestionably\r\nsignificant. In the four main cells of the table the expected distribution\r\nof males and females is given in brackets, x- works out at 39-98 with one\r\ndegree of freedom. The anti-chance odds exceed 109 to i. A precisely similar effect had been observed in the 1890 Census, as shown below (IV) : Table IV\u20141S90 Census\r\nMale Female\r\nPositive replies 655 1,029\r\nNegative replies 7-717 7>599\r\nAgain we see that of those who gave negative replies, males were in the majority, but of those who claimed hallucinations, females greatly\r\nexceeded males. This correlation with sex was further demonstrated by\r\nan analysis of those who replied that they had had more than one\r\nhallucination : Table V\r\nNo. of persons who said they had\r\nhad only one hallucination\r\nMale Female Unspecified Total\r\n49 78 6 133\r\nNo. of persons who said they had\r\nhad more than one hallucination\r\n23 60 I 84\r\nTable V shows that whereas there were nearly twice as many females\r\nas males among those who had had only one hallucination, there were\r\n194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nnearly three times as many among those who had had more than one. Thus the sex bias towards females was significantly more marked with\r\nthose who had had multiple hallucinations than with those who had\r\nexperienced only one. Perhaps, after all, this is what one would expect\r\nfrom the common observation that women are more imaginative than men.\r\nIt is generally accepted that hallucinations such as are described in this\r\nquestionnaire are subjective experiences, constructed in the mind of the\r\nperson who sees them. The evidence for this view is fairly conclusive,\r\nbut a consideration of the pros and cons is outside our present scope.\r\nPoints to notice in favour of the subjectivity of the phantasms are that\r\nusually only one individual is affected, and usually only one sense, either\r\nvision or hearing. Furthermore, there is among the phantasms every\r\ngradation of realism from what are recognised immediately as mental\r\n\" impressions \", through semi-exteriorised shadowy visions, to apparitions\r\nso life-like that the percipient can hardly believe he is not encountering\r\na real person.\r\nStrictly speaking, hallucinations come into the domain of psychical\r\nresearch only when they convey information unknown to the percipient.\r\nSo far as is known this so-called veridical variety is in every respect the same as an ordinary hallucination, except that the ideas in the percipient's\r\nmind which form the basis of the phantasms are obtained by paranormal\r\ncognition.\r\nIn about eleven per cent of the cases reported, the percipients considered\r\nthat their experience corresponded with some external event, or in other\r\nwords was \" veridical \". Here is a typical example which came from a housewife aged sixty-eight : \" About twenty-five years ago, I was busy sweeping the hearth, when\r\nI distinctly heard my mother's voice call my name. At the time she was\r\n150 miles away from me. A few days afterwards I had news that an\r\naunt of mine had passed away, almost at the identical moment. So far,\r\nthis is the only hallucination I have experienced.\"\r\nIn the 1890 Census an attempt was made to show that these veridical cases were too numerous to be accounted for by chance coincidence and\r\nother normal explanations. The arguments employed have since been\r\nseverely criticised, but that need not concern us here since the figures\r\nof the present investigation were too small to admit of any valid assessment.\r\nThe only feasible method of procedure in this investigation was to consider the cases individually. It was apparent from inspection that the\r\nmost striking of the veridical cases were usually those most remote in\r\ntime, or reported at second-hand. Doubtless this was due to unwitting\r\nexaggeration, an effect which was well marked in the 1890 Census. However, there were a dozen or so cases which showed promise, and these were followed up, but not one could be sufficiently corroborated to bring\r\nit up to the standard of the average case printed in the Journal. Here is just one example which is fairly representative :\r\nMale, 30. Physical Training Officer. \" Sometime in 1940 a pilot's friend, also a pilot, was on night \" circuit\r\nand bumps \": the pilot had gone to bed at his usual time (about 11) and some time later he was awakened by his friend (who shared the room)\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Questionnaire on Hallucinations 195\r\ncoming in and switching on the Ught. The pilot looked at his watch and saw that it was just after midnight ; he inquired, \" Finished early? \" to which his friend replied, \" Yes \". The pilot turned over and went back\r\nto sleep. He discovered next morning that his friend had been killed in an aircraft accident just about the time he woke up.\"\r\nIn response to the Research Officer's questions, the following additional\r\ninformation was received :\r\nI T^th January, 1948\r\n\" Dear Sir,\r\nPlease accept my apologies for not answering your letter of 23rd\r\nDecember, 1947, before. I am afraid I cannot amplify my reply to the\r\nrecent Mass Observation directive on hallucinations very much as I lost touch Vvith the pilot, who told me of his experiences, some years ago.\r\nThe best answers I can give to your main queries are :\r\n(a) No, the dead man had been engaged on local night flying, not\r\noperations.\r\n(b) It is possible that the whole experience had been a dream, but\r\nfrom the way my friend told it to me, I do not think so.\r\n(c) I do not know [whether anyone was told of the experience before news of the death became known].\r\n(d) I do not know [whether anyone was told about the incident soon\r\nafter it happened].\r\n(e) It is possible that mistaken identity had occurred, but again, I do\r\nnot think so.\r\nI am sorry that I cannot help you more, but the reason why I included\r\nthis account in the directive was the very vivid impression left in my mind\r\nwhen I heard it, and the belief that my friend was telling the truth.\"\r\nThe best veridical case was the following. It was sent by a woman\r\ncorrespondent. No corroboration is available. \" One night about twelve years ago I was in bed, but wide awake, v\/ith an electric light still on over the bed. I was reading when suddenly a figure floated over me about a foot above my head. She was wearing a white, long-sleeved night-dress, and her hair looked as brilliantly red as it really was. I reached up and stroked her face, which felt just like any\r\nother face. The figure at once faded away.\r\n\" This friend was not ill to my knowledge. . . . She died that night.\"\r\nIn answer to the Research Officer's questions, the lady replied as follows :\r\n(1) \" Yes. I know all about death wraiths. I read Myers and Flammarion many years ago, and always keep in touch with these subjects.\r\nI certainly thought it meant my friend's death. I was about thirty-eight.\r\n(2) \" I told my mother next morning, but no one else. (She is since\r\ndead.) Curiously enough it was not a very mtimate friend. She was a woman who had impressed me very much as a child. For some years we\r\nhad not been in close touch, and I can never understand why it was to me she appeared.\r\n(3) \" I am quite certain it was not a dream. I always read for an hour\r\nabout three o'clock in the morning. The electric light was on and I was\r\n196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nfully awake. I never have any tactile sense in dreams. I still remember\r\nthe \" feel \" of stroking her face as she floated above me.\r\n\" My grandfather is supposed to have been highly psychic, particularly\r\nin dreams of premonition. He died before I was born, so I have only\r\nfamily tradition to go by. \" 1 had, forty years ago, a very intense impression of my father, but I have never called this anything beyond a dream as I was on the edge of\r\nsleep. He appeared to me three months after his death in great misery\r\nand worry about his affairs, and begging for three months more on earth\r\nto put things straight. I did not then know that occultists say that those\r\nwho die exhausted take three months to awake.\r\n\" I am not psychic in general affairs. I have often tried to get some\r\nim.pression at such places as Glastonbury, but without success.\"\r\nTo sum up, this small-scale investigation has been sufficient to provide\r\na strong indication that among the class of people questioned there has\r\nbeen no diminution in the frequency, and no substantial change in the\r\ncharacter, of sporadic hallucinations since the census of fifty-eight years\r\nago. Among those prone to hallucinations during health, there is a definite\r\npreponderance of females. Hallucinations believed to be veridical are a\r\ndistinct minority, claimed by less than two per cent of all who answered\r\nthe question. Much rarer still are veridical hallucinations which the\r\npercipient is able to substantiate. Not one such was found in the whole of\r\nthe three hundred and more hallucinations reoorted. - .\r\nFAMILY TELEPATHY\r\nBy G. N. M. Tyrrell\r\nIs telepathy common or rare? In spite of sixty-five years of psychical\r\nresearch, this question is not easy to answer. The Census of Hallucinations, carried out by the S.P.R. during the last decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, showed that about ten per cent of the population of Great Britain\r\nexperience, or at that time experienced, sensory hallucinations while in\r\nthe waking state. But this does not help us to estimate the frequency of\r\ntelepathy ; for the sensory hallucination is only one of the forms in which\r\ntelepathy expresses itself. Also many hallucinations occur which have\r\nnothing to do with telepathy at all. Even if Ave were to search the archives of the S.P.R. and to count\r\nevery spontaneous case of ostensible telepathy, we should still be unable\r\nto answer the question ; for all we should then know would be how many\r\ncases had reached the S.P.R. during a particular period, and had succeeded\r\nin attaining the evidential standard set for validity. Since few people\r\ntake the precautions which make a case evidentially valid, it is obvious to common-sense that the accepted cases can form only a small proportion\r\nof the whole.\r\nIs there any way by which we can form a rough idea of the frequency\r\nwith which telepathy takes place in ordinary life? Many people interested\r\nin psychical research must have noticed that a large proportion of those\r\nthey meet have either themselves had experiences which seem to be\r\ntelepathic, or know others who have. But this is vague testimony, too\r\nuncertain to support a solid conclusion. Can we use the large mass of\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Family Telepathy 197\r\nofficially infra-valid testimony as a basis on which to form a more concrete\r\njudgment?\r\nOpinion on this matter is likely to be divided. Some will say that,\r\nquite clearly, the spontaneous and experimental evidence which is officially valid is all v\/e have to go on, and outside that, there is nothing on which we can base any sure inference. Every case which does not\r\nreach the official standard may have a normal explanation, and therefore\r\nmust be assumed to be a normal happening. The widespread repoi'ts of\r\nwhat appears to be telepathy must be dismissed, and it must be admitted\r\nthat we do not know whether telepathy is the daily companion of tens of\r\nthousands of people or not. Others will take a different view. Surely, they will argue, the standard\r\nset for official validity is arbitrary. Do you ask us to believe that this\r\narbitrary standard happens to coincide with the line marking off cases of real telepathy from cases which look just like telepathy, but are actually\r\nnormal happenings in disguise? It is perfectly evident to com.mon-sense\r\nthat it is only a difference in the degree of care or laxity in recording the\r\ncases which causes some to fall on one side of the official line and some\r\non the other. Many of those which were carelessly recorded niust I'lave been genuine cases ; and it is perfectly legitimate to draw the conclusion\r\nthat telepathy occurs much more frequently than the official examples\r\nindicate.\r\nHow are we to meet this dilemma? Shall v\/e use the second argument\r\nto grant validity to some of the unofficial cases? That would mean\r\nlowering the official standard of evidence. Or shall we, using the first argument, admit that the frequency with which telepathy occurs is an\r\ninsoluble problem? That would be to fly in the face of common-sense.\r\nI would suggest that the dilemma arises from the fact that we have\r\nbrought to bear on the problems of psychical research a spirit and a method which is too exclusively analytical. Most emphatically, I should\r\nsay, we must 7iot lower the standard of official evidence. There is no need\r\nto do so. But, while collecting evidence of the official type, we should\r\nalso busy ourselves with field-observation.\r\nBy the use of the quantitative type of experiment, in which the chancefactor is mathematically dealt with, the investigator hopes to be absolved\r\nfrom the onus of making a personal judgment regarding the probability\r\nor improbability of the phenomena. But this personal judgment cannot\r\nbe evaded. It is the central factor affecting the assessment of evidence\r\nthroughout the subject, whether of the quantitative or qualitative kind.\r\nIt is, for example, quite evident that, in spite of the probability-hgure\r\nattaching to a quantitative experiment, the result is not regarded uniformly\r\nby everyone. Assessment of quantitative experiments varies enormously.\r\nIf a critic who regards the paranormal explanation of an experiment as highly improbable cannot explain it by chance, he merely shifts the\r\nexplanation on to something else. It is possible to explain almost anything\r\naway by suggesting improbable hypotheses. If it is pointed out to the\r\ncritic that the normal hypothesis he suggests is improbable, he merely\r\nsays that the paranormal explanation is more improbable. So we come to the crucial factor in the end, which is the critic's personal estimate of the\r\ndegree of improbability attaching to the paranormal hypothesis.\r\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nIt is therefore useless to ignore evidence of the paranormal which has no probability-figure attached to it in the hope that by so doing we shall make sure and certain progress. The personal assessment is inevitable.\r\nThe field of public certainty, or even of public unanimity is, in psychical\r\nresearch, very small indeed.\r\nField-observation involves personal judgment ; but, since that is inevitable in any case, we may as well secure the benefit it offers of giving us sound ideas about the nature of E.S.P. For this purpose the following\r\nexamples of admittedly sub-valid occurrences in E.S.P. are submitted to the judgment of readers of the Journal. They give a picture of the way\r\nin which telepathy, or E.S.P., works in ordinary life, for those who think\r\nthe paranormal explanation probable ; and of the way in which normal\r\noccurrences disguise themselves as paranormal occurrences for those who\r\nthink the paranormal explanation improbable. They are offered, not as an attempt to smuggle black sheep into the official fold, but as a sample of\r\nthe natural background which psychical research offers for field-observaation. They are exceedingly trivial. So is a wisp of smoke from a supposedly extinct volcano ; but both can be significant.\r\nThe cases are provided by Mrs Frank Heywood (the original instigator\r\nof this article) ; Miss Theodora Bosanquet, with a short instance by a friend of hers ; Mrs Renee Tickell, and Miss G. M. Johnson. These\r\nladies were not selected on account of their experiences. They are a group\r\nof friends interested in psychical research : and such interest does not\r\nguarantee more telepathic experiences than fall to the lot of others ; nor\r\ndoes it guarantee that the immediate friends of the group will have more. However, it should be allowed that within a group of friends some selection on account of experiences did take place, and that therefore the group is not quite on a par with one selected at random. For those who think that\r\nthese cases should be allowed some cogency as evidence, this fact should\r\nbe allowed for. But if we suppose that the group has ten times the\r\nquantity of telepathic experience that would fall to the lot of a group\r\nrandomly chosen, the indication would still be that telepathy is a widespread and fairly common factor at work in daily life. Mrs Heywood says : \" My husband met a man in London who\r\nexpounded to him the theory that by concentrated attention one could\r\nimprove the circulation and so warm cold feet. This my husband\r\npractised during the day. On his return to the country I said to him,\r\nbefore he mentioned it : 'I cannot think what has happened to my feet,\r\nwhich are usually so cold ; they have been burning hot.' \"\r\n\" One foggy evening in the country during the war black-out I had a strong impulse to go to the station to meet my husband, as I felt he had\r\nno torch. My mother tried energetically to dissuade me on account of\r\nthe bad weather, and knowing that my husband always carried his torch.\r\nBut the impulse was too strong and I walked twenty minutes through the\r\nnight in a November fog. On his arrival, my husband said :\r\n' I am glad\r\nto see you ; my torch gave out as I left the Ministry.' I hailed a car a moment later, which gave us a lift, so that my torch was not needed.\"\r\n\" A master at Eton had promised to let me know if a vacancy in a good\r\nhouse should crop up for my son. He wrote me that an excellent vacancy\r\nhad unexpectedly occurred, which he advised me to accept at once. But\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Family Telepathy ' - 199\r\nI had a strong impulse to write to a friend of my childhood whom I had\r\nonly seen three or four times since the 19 14 war, and with whom I was\r\nquite out of touch, and ask his opinion. I knew his boys were at Eton,\r\nbut I did not know in which house. A long reply came that the vacancy\r\nhad occurred because he had removed his boy from that house\u2014and\r\ngiving me good reasons why I should not send my boy there. I remember\r\nfeeling a great reluctance to do so absurd a thing as write to him about\r\nit.\"\" In the autumn of 1944 I was about to furnish a house I had taken in\r\nLondon when I had a strong impulse to ask the Tyrrells to come and live in it for a time\u2014this although I had no reason to suppose that they would\r\nhave any wish to leave their house at Worthing. I did so and they replied\r\nthat they had unexpectedly to vacate their house, had nowhere to go, and\r\nwould be glad to come.\"\r\nIn the next case there is an experimental element. It is by no means\r\nthe only case in which Col. and Mrs Heywood have used their telepathic\r\nlinkage deliberately on specific occasions.\r\nCol. Heywood noted the case immediately after its occurrence as follows : \"I was travelling from Brussels to London when I realised that\r\nthe train would reach Victoria an hour earlier than a telegram I had sent\r\nmy wife would lead her to believe. I realised when already in the train\r\nat Folkestone harbour that if there were no porters at Victoria I should\r\nhave difficulty in getting my four pieces of luggage to a taxi. I hoped,\r\ntherefore, that my wife would ring up the Southern Railway to ask\r\nwhether the train would be late. She would then be told that I would be\r\ndue in at 1900 hours ; she would meet me and she would then carry the\r\nsmall things while I carried my two heavy bags. As we have many a time successfully practised telepathy, I tried to send her a message to\r\nthis effect. I repeated it several times during the journey.\"\r\nMrs Heywood noted down her part of the incident at the time as follows : \" On Sunday, November iith, 1945, my husband telegraphed\r\nthat he expected to return from Belgium on the following Wednesday,\r\narriving at Victoria at 8 p.m. It did not occur to me to meet him as I thought his train would probably be very late, and at 6.30, too tired to\r\nread, I lay down on my bed for a short rest. A few minutes later the\r\nfeeling of my husband's arrival ' flowed in ' upon me. I cannot think\r\nof a better expression. I felt : Of course I must meet him ; he may have\r\na lot of things to carry and be unable to get a porter. I must ring up at once to see what time the train will arrive. \" Very reluctantly, almost recalcitrantly, I got up and did so, to learn\r\nthat the train was due, net at 8 but at 7 p.m. I flung on my clothes and\r\nhurried out of the house, saying to some friends who were downstairs, ' I must go and meet Frank and carry things for him.'\r\nOn reaching the station, I engaged a porter before the train was in.\r\nI thought on the way that my behaviour was somewhat illogical, for my\r\nhusband would need a taxi and I saw no reason why he should not find a\r\nporter. So I asked as we met, ' Did you send me a message? ' He replied,\r\n' Yes! ' \" The \" friends downstairs \" to whom Mrs Heywood refers were Mrs\r\nTyrrell and Miss Johnson. They both signed a statement saying that\r\n200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nthey remembered that she spoke to them as above as she hurried off to the\r\nstation. This case is there well attested.\r\nCases of this kind occur to Mrs Heywood at fairly regular intervals.\r\nMiss Bosanquet writes as an observer rather than as an experimenter.\r\nIn one case, she says : \" Mr and Mrs B. D. lived in Devonshire. They\r\nhad a cook who had been with them for several years and seemed to them\r\nto possess something they called ' second sight'. She often seemed to know more than was easily accountable for by normal channels of information. She was a bit of a character and was well-known to all Mrs B. D.'s\r\nfamily circle of brothers and sisters. Her name v\/as Ellen C.\r\n\" One morning, while Mrs B. D. was talking to Ellen in the kitchen,\r\nthey saw the garden gate opened by a messenger-boy carrying a telegram.\r\nEllen said at once :\r\n' Mr W. is dead and that's a warning telegram.' Mr\r\nW. was Mrs B. D.'s eldest brother. He lived, with another brother, in the Isle of Wight. When she opened the telegram, she read :\r\n' W.\r\nseriously ill. V\/riting. R.' W. was, in fact, dead when the telegram was\r\nsent. He had not been known to be at all seriously ill and the brother he\r\nlived with, R., had not thought it necessary to let anyone know that W.\r\nwas ill. He thought it was quite a slight, passing malady. W.'s sudden\r\ndeath came to him as a great shock.\" This is only one of several cases of\r\napparent E.S.P. which Ellen experienced.\r\nThe next case apparently involves precognition. It is prefaced by the\r\nfollowing note : \" Miss Annie New, the percipient dreamer, sleeps in a room on the fourth fioor of Keyes House, Dolphin Square, S.W.i. Lady\r\nRhondda, who seems to have been the agent, lives in a flat on the other\r\nside of the Keyes House block and a floor higher\u2014503 Keyes House.\"\r\nThen follows the incident : \" On the morning of Tuesday, April 30, 1946,\r\nLady Rhondda was disturbed some time between 6.30 and 6.45 a.m. by a loud noise made by a man hammering on the roof of a block to the north\r\n(Rodney House). Looking out of her v\/indow she could see the man at work with his large hammer. At 6.45 she left her bedroom and went into\r\nthe sitting-room next door where she telephoned to the porter about the\r\nterrible lot of noise which was going on. Then she went back to bed.\r\n\" Miss New, who is Lady Rhondda's housekeeper, came up to No. 503\r\nat about 7.30. Nobody said anything to her about the hammering until\r\nafter breakfast. Then Lady Rhondda said : ' There was a man on the\r\nroof hammerirg and making the most awful noise at a quarter to seven.' \" Miss New said at once :\r\n' Oh, I dreamt that you were telephoning to the management about a noise on the roof.' Lady Rhondda had not\r\nmentioned telephoning, and Miss New said she hadn't heard any hammering herself (her room faces another way). Asked what time the dream\r\nhad cccurred. Miss New said it must have been between four and six. She said she v\/ent to sleep again afterwards.\r\n\" Subsequently, in the evening, Miss New said she had been thinking more about the dream and thought that what she heard (in a state described\r\nas half-awake and half-asleep) was not exactly a telephone conversation\r\nbut Lady Rhondda's voice sounding from the loud speaker of the radio\r\nset in her bedroom (Miss New's bedroom) talking about the awful sound\r\non the roof. She put the time as definitely very near six o'clock.\" This\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Family Telepathy 201\r\nstatement was signed by Lady Rhondda and Miss New on May 3rd, and\r\ncorroborated by Miss Bosanquet.\r\nThe next case is contained in an extract from a letter from a friend, Miss\r\nM.A., to Miss Bosanquet, dated July 14th, 1946 : \"For sometime I have been\r\ntrying to get some pale grey paint for my staircase. After bothering\r\neveryone for it for months, I gave up and decided to live with spotty\r\nstairs until times grew better. Then about a month ago, I began to\r\n' remember ' that I ought to ' go to Colchester to buy some paint '. In\r\nvain I pointed out to myself that paint was unobtainable ; this item kept\r\npopping up on the ' things I must do ' list in my mind. I go to Colchester\r\nabout tvs'ice a year : it is a set-out requiring hired cars and Christina.\r\nHowever, so strong was the impulse that I roused myself and went about\r\na fortnight ago, although I had no real errand. I went at once to the\r\npaint-shop and asked for some creaw. paint. (I had given up looking for\r\ngrey, you see. Cream we always need anyhow.) There was none, of\r\ncourse, and I was just coming out feeling vaguely surprised when I noticed\r\na huge tin standing all by itself on the empty paint-shelves. I looked at\r\nit and found it was a gallon (the amount I needed) of grey paint of the shade\r\nI wanted. I asked if I could have it, and they said ' Yes '. \" This case might be assigned to telepathy or to clairvoyance ; but it suggests rather an unclassifiable ability to acquire knowledge of a general\r\nsituation, of which I have come across many examples.\r\nThe next case has much more the appearance of being telepathy in\r\nthe narrower sense of thought-transference, though probably we should\r\nbe very careful how we trust appearances.\r\nSir Alan Moore, a member of the Society, received a letter written by\r\nhis sister, Mrs Pryor, M.B.E., on January 9th, 1948, reporting an example\r\nof apparent telepathic communication between herself and her husband,\r\nCol. W. M. Pryor, J.P., D.S.O. Col. and Mrs Pryor live at Hitchin.\r\nShe v\/rote : \" Last night we had a perfect example of telepathy. There\r\nis going to be a\r\n' Brains Trust ' next week in the village hall and Jack is taking part. Last night we {i.e. Jack and I) were trying to think of some\r\nquestions and had thought of a few which I had written down. I had\r\njust written down the last, ' Why does a horse get up front legs first, etc.?\r\n' and we were both silent, thinking hard. I was staring into the fire and\r\nmy thoughts went like this : ' A burnt child dreads the fire\u2014is pain\r\ntherefore useful? ' As I opened my mouth to speak. Jack said ' Is pain\r\nuseful? ' I gave you the previous question to show that the ' pain ' one was not suggested by it. . . .\"\r\nMrs Tickell writes : \" Telepathy between children and their parents,\r\nand more particularly their mothers, has rarely been discussed ; partly\r\nbecause both parties are apt to take it very much for granted, partly\r\nbecause the conscious and articulate member of the partnership is usually\r\nso busy that she has no time to note what is happening except in terms of,\r\n' Well, isn't that odd? ' and partly because it is almost impossible to subject to laboratory tests. \" In the note that follows, this last difficulty has not been overcome. They are the outcome of ' field-naturalist ', day-to-day observations,\r\n202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\ngeneral and particular, and their evidential value is nil. It is probable\r\nthat most mothers, if their attention vrere drawn to the matter, could\r\nproduce much material of the same kind. \" In general, the first startling fact to be recorded is the extraordinary\r\nand frequently maddening sensitiveness of even very young babies to the\r\npsychological ' atmosphere ' of their surroundings. This is not entirely\r\ndue to the fact that tension or placidity in the mother may affect her milk,\r\nand so react on the child's temperament through its digestion, for it can be seen in bottle-fed infants, and even in those brought up by nurses. \" Thus a mother who is harassed, tired and anxious will in most cases find her mood reflected and her burden increased by a jumpy, sleepless\r\nand fretful baby who will react in the same way to family discussion,\r\nhowever distantly and inaudibly conducted and smilingly dissembled. . . . \" At an older stage, when verbal communication with children becomes\r\npossible, they will often be found to react more vividly to what parents\r\nthink than to what they say, and it is dangerous, out shopping or in public\r\nplaces, to allow oneself to think of topics or situations one does not want\r\ndiscussed, otherwise the most embarrassing queries can be made. ' Why\r\nis that woman not keeping her place in the queue? ' Or, apropos of a negro, ' Is it very dirty in Africa? ' and so on. A quick interior switch- over to thoughts of summer holidays or Christmas crackers or even the\r\nimminence of the next sweet-ration period will usually forestall this. \" As to detailed instances, I should like to cite five. (1) \"A mother was sorting the laundry in her bedroom, out of which\r\nthe nursery opened. In the nursery, out of sight but not out of hearing, was her five-year-old daughter J. There were no mirrors and no dark\r\nreflecting pictures there. In the laundry basket there were a number of\r\ncoloured handkerchiefs, red, blue, green, pink and yellow. These were\r\nbeing allotted to various piles when J. was heard to remark, ' That's a pretty green one.' Her mother, rather surprised, for she ivas dealing out\r\na green one, asked the child to ' guess ' what was coming next. To her\r\namazement J. guessed a whole series absolutely correctly as her mother\r\nlooked at them still in the blue tissue paper of the laundry basket. It was\r\nimpossible for J. to see them.\r\n(2) \"I was sitting one day in a meadow, along one side of which flowed\r\nthe river Windrush, first as a mill pond and then, after a strong waterfall, as a quick stream. With me were my two elder sons, then one and three\r\nand a half years old. We were a good 1 50 yards from the river, and I had\r\nwarned the bigger boy, who was generally sensible about danger, not to go near it. I was rolling the baby one over in the grass, and his brother\r\nwas, as I thought, picking daisies for a wreath close by. Suddenly, as if an arm had pulled me, I felt I must turn round ; I did so, and saw the\r\nbig boy three quarters of the way to the waterfall. He had turned round\r\nand was staring fixedly at me with a mixture of defiance and hope that he\r\nwould not be observed. I suppose his defiance had ' got through ' to me\r\nsomehow and made me aware that something was wrong. I rushed after\r\nhim\u2014and he, of course, ran on as fast as his legs could carry him\u2014and\r\ngot up with him before he reached the edge. \" Incidentally, a pretty demonstration of telepathy can be given by two\r\npeople in any large place where a crowd is dining, particularly in schools\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Family Telepathy 203\r\nor colleges, by staring at the back of whoever it is desired to rouse, and\r\nwatching how soon she turns round. (I say ' she ' because I have only\r\ntried it in a girls' school and a women's college. I think men may not be\r\nso easily moved.)\r\n(3) \"I was talking to my youngest son, aged four and a half, and telling\r\nhim why a certain school was called ' Arnold House ': he thought\r\n' Arnold ' a funny name. I explained that Dr Arnold had altered English\r\nschools a great deal and that he had had a school of his own, whose name\r\nI could not at the moment remember. I went on dressing him, and had\r\nforgotten our conversation when he said :\r\n' What did you say about some- where called Ruggy? ' I said I hadn't mentioned anywhere called Ruggy,\r\nand that I'd never heard the name. He looked much puzzled and went\r\non saying Ruggy to himself. Then I remembered we had spoken of Dr\r\nArnold and said, ' Is it where Dr Arnold taught? Do you mean Rugby? ' He looked very much relieved and said, ' Yes, that's right, Rugby.' I had\r\nnot consciously thought of Rugby at all.\r\n(4) \" A boy, aged twelve, was away at school during a period of acute\r\nfamily anxiety, of which it was impossible for him to have known.\r\nThroughout its duration, however, he was reported by his headmaster to be agitated, jumpy, tearful, and finding concentration very difficult. On\r\nthe same day that the anxiety ended, he changed completely and become\r\nhis usual cheerful, lively, interested self, and remained so.\r\n(5) \" A Si\"^!' whose mother suffered badly from irregular migraine,\r\nusually knew, whenever she was away from her, when these attacks were coming on ; this between the ages of ten and twenty. Before that, she was seldom parted from her ; and afterwards the migraine began to improve. (Curiously enough, with its disappearance there disappeared\r\nalso the mother's faculty for extra-sensory perception.)\"\r\nMiss Johnson's cases of \" family telepathy \" are so many that it is diffi- cult to choose among them. Often they appear to possess an element of\r\nprecognition ; and they do not give the impression that \" telepathy \" is the right, or at any rate the comprehensive term for them. The faculty\r\nappears to be one of acquiring information of any kind if it is required for a particular purpose. There is often no indication that the source of the\r\ninformation is any particular person's mind.\r\nOne trivial incident is the following : On the i'.nd November, 1947, Airs Tyrrell, Miss Johnson and myself were to visit some people living about six miles away, whom we had never\r\nseen before. While dressing. Miss Johnson was about to put on a chain\r\nbracelet when she saw in a mental picture, visually, though, as she\r\ndescribes it, \" at the back of her mind \", a lady whose appearance and\r\ndress she noted, wearing a bracelet exactly like her own. So strong was\r\nthis impression that she did not put her bracelet on. When we arrived\r\nat the house, the hostess appeared, and was at once recognised by Miss\r\nJohnson as the lady of her visual picture, both by her dress and personal\r\nappearance. She was wearing a bracelet extremely like Miss Johnson's.\r\nNone of us had ever seen any member of this family before. We had been\r\nintroduced to them by letter by someone who had never described the\r\npersonal appearance of any of them. Later, on comparing notes, it was\r\n204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nfound that at almost the exact time when Miss Johnson had her visual\r\nimpression, the hostess was putting her bracelet on. In October, 1944, while helping Mrs Heywood to stock her house in\r\nLondon with domestic amenities. Miss Johnson tried to obtain a pail and\r\nsink-strainer. These articles were very scarce at that date, and she had\r\ntried for them in vain. In particular, Peter Jones said they had none and were not expecting any. Next morning Miss Johnson woke up seeing\r\na visual image \" in the back of her mind \" of a green pail and sink-strainer,\r\naccompanied by a feeling that they were to be had at Peter Jones. She\r\nwent there as early as possible and said to the assistant that she believed\r\nthey had some green pails and sink-strainers now in stock. There were none on view, and the shop-assistant asked her how she knew. They\r\nwere, he said, at the time being unpacked behind the scenes, having arrived\r\nunexpectedly the previous evening. I am told that ladies will appreciate\r\nthe importance of the fact that these articles were green ; for green pails\r\nand strainers were at that time extremelv rare, those that were available\r\nbeing usually white.\r\nWith Miss Johnson, incidents of this kind happen regularly. That they\r\nshould be largely concerned with shopping and food during austerity\r\ntimes is probably due to the fact that the faculty responds to interest or\r\nnecessity. Few of these cases could be made formally evidential because\r\nthe experience, when it occurs, is \"at the back of the mind \", and Miss\r\nJohnson finds it extremely difficult to put it into words, either orally or\r\nin writing, before the event which verifies it has taken place or become\r\nknown. The verification of the event, by supplying corroboration through\r\nthe senses and the brain, appears to remove this inhibition, but of course\r\ntoo late. She does not find the same difficulty, however, in acting on the\r\nexperience that she does in putting it into words.\r\nThe situation with regard to these cases is in one way ironical. Although\r\nmost of them do not constitute formal evidence for telepathy, many of\r\nthem are veiy useful. The above examples show that most of Mrs\r\nHeywood's are ; Miss Johnson's certainly are, as I can personally testify ; Miss M. A.'s experience was, and so was Mrs Tickell's case beside the\r\nV\/indrush. It used to be said by some critics that the acid test of the\r\nparanorm.al is the pragmatic one. Show that you can make use of the\r\nevidence, said this school of critics, and you need not be quite so fussy\r\nabout evidential standards.\r\nWhat form will criticism take now? We have a steady flow of minor\r\ncases which are unquestionably useful. Will the former argument of the\r\ncritics be reversed? Will it now be said that utility is no criterion of\r\nthe validity of evidence ; that all these minor cases are evidentially faulty\r\nbecause some normal explanation or other could be fitted to each, and\r\nthat therefore all the cases are disposed of. Well, in any case, I know of one family at least which will continue to make use of Family Telepathy\u2014whether it exists or not!\r\n(Miss G. M. Johnson, the percipient member of Mr Tyrrell's household, has provided the interesting note on her own kind of experience\r\ngiven below :)\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Family Telepathy ' \u2022 205\r\nSir,\u2014As one who knows something of Family Telepathy from the\r\nproducer's end, may I add some remarks about the above article? These,\r\nof course, apply to my own experience only.\r\nAt the meeting at Caxton Hall on January 30th, the question was raised\r\nwhy sensitives' cases have recently been so scarce. It seems to me as one reason for this that the faculty follows the chief occupation of life and goes where the interest is fixed. This means that in austerity times,\r\nit finds its outlet in shopping and practical things.\r\nMy own facultv has in no way diminished ; which makes me wonder\r\nwhether it has in the case of others. But I do find that it can be overlaid\r\nby worry, anxiety, a feeling of insecurity and so on. The harassed life one leads now-a-days has the effect of interfering with its natural\r\nactivities.\r\nI have always found that the most important condition for success is the personal relation between the subject and the investigator. Without\r\ncomplete understanding and confidence on both sides, the faculty is apt\r\nto subside. The relation is very delicate. The slightest thing wrong will spoil everything. The existence of the right relation between Mr Tyrrell\r\nand myself was, I am sure, the condition which secured my success in the\r\nE.S.P. experiments we made on the electrical machine, before Dr Soal\r\nand Mr Whately Carington obtained their results with cards and drawings.\r\nI have been surprised when listening to discussions on why it was that\r\nProf. Rhine obtained his results so much more easily than did British\r\ninvestigators, that no one seemed to realise how all-important this relation\r\nis. The suggestion made by Professor Broad at the Caxton Hall meeting,\r\nthat British and American subjects should be interchanged would, I feel sure, if it could be carried out, demonstrate this clearly.\r\nIn my own case (it may be different with others) E.S.P. usually comes\r\nto me in the form of an internal conviction (and by \" internal \" I mean\r\nthat it has not properly entered into my consciousness). I just know, in\r\nthis internal Avay, that such and such an event has happened or is going to happen ; or that suc'n and such a thing must be done. Sometimes these\r\nfeelings are accompanied by an internal image of a visual kind. This\r\ndiffers from the images of imagination, which I can often see very vividly,\r\npartly on account of a different feeling which comes with it. It is a distinctive feeling which marks it off from imagination ; though it is almost\r\nimpossible to say in words what the feeling is. Partlv, also, the image\r\nwhich goes with E.S.P. is less on the surface than the image which goes\r\nwith imagination.\r\nWhen these convictions come to me, I find that it is very much easier to act on them than to put them into words. For this reason I cannot\r\noften make my cases evidential for the public.\r\nG. M. Johnson\r\nTwo Experiences\r\n(The following account of two experiences has been received from Miss\r\nValentine Ackland, a member of the Society. They appear to fit well into\r\nthe general frame of Family Telepathy and add further illustration to Mr Tyrrell's article.)\r\n2o6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAR.-APR. 1948\r\nIn a latter dated February 4th, 1948, Miss Valentine Ackland writes : \" I have had two experiences of precognition which I would like to put on record ; both can be vouched for, I think, satisfactorily. \" The first happened in 1930 or early 1931 (I could find the exact date\r\nby looking up the files of the Daily Express). \" I had dreamed, during the night, that my mother walked in to the large\r\nstudio in which I then lived (2 Queensborough Studios, W.2). She was\r\ncarrying a newspaper in her hand and had a certain expression on her face\r\nwhich her family irreverently calls ' her death-face ' (an expression of\r\ncommiseration and anticipation). She said as she came into the room (in\r\nmy dream), ' I'm afraid it will be rather a shock to you, darling\u2014poor\r\nStephen Tomlin is dead\u2014he has been killed in an aeroplane accident!\r\n' \" Directly I woke I told this to Sylvia Warner, who was staying with\r\nme at the time and who also knew Stephen Tomlin.\r\n\" Within half-an-hour or so my mother knocked at the door and came\r\nin : my dream was exactly repeated in every detail, except that the dead\r\nyoung man was not Stephen Tomlin (whom I only knew slightly) but\r\nhis brother Garrow, whom I knew very well. \" Another example happened about two to three months ago, and was\r\nnot a dream-experience.\r\n\" I left the house to go out shopping. The morning post had arrived\r\nbefore I left. While I was out I suddenly thought with annoyance that a\r\nletter had come from Janet Machen and I had forgotten to read it. I could not remember where I had left it, either. \" Returning at lunch-time I went straight into the room where Sylvia\r\nWarner was (she shares my house) and said, ' Did you find a letter from\r\nJanet anywhere.' I forgot to read it before I left this morning\u2014.' \" I thought her face expressed alarm and dismay, and then she said,\r\n' After you had gone the postman came back again and brought a letter from Janet to you which he had forgotten to deliver\u2014it's in the hall at this moment.'\r\n\" The letter was quite unimportant and I had no particular reason to be expecting one from her, nor any kind of urgent interest in it. \" I have had very many other similar experiences, but not as sharplydefined as the two I have related. I think many people have them\u2014\u2022\r\nusually in the form of ' prophetic ' dreams, or dreads, or ' hunches '. Mostly, mine are rather impersonal and do not seem to be related to fear or disaster (I know the first experience described here seems to belie this).\r\nBut I do not want to take up time and space by telling a great many, often\r\nuncorroborated, stories.\"\r\nThese statements are corroborated by Miss Sylvia Townsend Warner,\r\nwho writes : \"I have read both these accounts carefully. I have a very\r\ndefinite recollection of both occasions, and I confirm that Valentine\r\nAckland's narrative is exactly true to what occurred.\"\r\n\" OUT-OF-THE-BODY \" EXPERIENCE\r\nThe following account was sent to the Research Officer in November,\r\n1947, by a correspondent who does not want his name mentioned. He\r\nwrites as follows :\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 \" Out-of-the-Body \" Experience . 207\r\n\" I have described below an experience which I have always intended\r\nsending to the Society for Psychical Research, but have hitherto neglected\r\nto do so. The incident took place on August 3rd, 1944, near Saint Charles\r\nde Percy in Normandy. I was an armoured car officer engaged in medium\r\nand long range reconnaissance work with the 21st Army Group. At\r\nabout 2.30 p.m. on the above-named day I was in a small armoured scout\r\ncar which received a direct hit from a German anti-tank gun. Our car, which' was full of various explosives, grenades, phosphorus bombs, etc.,\r\nblew up. I might mention that it was stationary at the time, having just\r\nhalted. The force of the explosion threw me about twenty feet away\r\nfrom the car and over a five-foot hedge. My clothes, etc., were on fire,\r\nand there were various pieces of phosphorus sticking to me which were\r\nalso burning. Now my immediate reaction to the explosion, which\r\nappeared to me from the middle of it like a great white cold sheet, with a strong smell of cordite, was (naturally enough) fear. I imagined for a split\r\nsecond that I had gone to hell, and I quickly tried to recollect some\r\nparticular vice which might have been my qualification. It is interesting\r\nto notice that I did not see any rapid ' trailer ' of my past life as, I believe,\r\ndrowning persons report. All this took a fraction of a second, and the\r\nnext experience was definitely unusual. I was conscious of being two\r\npersons\u2014one, lying on the ground in a field where I had fallen from the\r\nblast, my clothes, etc., on fire, and waving my limbs about wildly, at the same time uttering moans and gibbering with fear\u2014I was quite conscious\r\nof both making these sounds, and at the same time hearing them as though coming from another person. The other ' me ' was fioating up\r\nin the air, about twenty feet from the ground, from which position I could\r\nsee not only my other self on the ground, but also the hedge, the road,\r\nand the car which was surrounded by smoke and burning fiercely. I remember quite distinctly telling myself :\r\n' It's no use gibbering like that\u2014roll over and over to put the flames out.' This my ground body\r\neventually did, rolling over into a ditch under the hedge where there was\r\na slight amount of water. The flames went out, and at this stage I suddenly\r\nbecame one person again. \" Of course, the aerial viewpoint can be explained up to a point as a\r\n' photograph ' taken subconsciously as I was passing over the hedge as\r\na result of the blast. This, however, does not explain the fact that I saw\r\n' myself ' on the ground quite clearly and for what seemed a long time,\r\nthough it could not have been more than a minute or so. Naturally there can be no witnesses as to this, and the fact that I have\r\ntold the occurrence to a number of people since might have led me to exaggeration of those details\u2014though I do not think that is the case.\r\nI can still remember all the details quite clearly as they happened at the\r\ntime.\"\r\nIn answer to questions put to him by the Research Officer the gentleman\r\nwrote again as follows : - _\r\n-\r\n\" While I cannot remember definitely having read of a similar case, I must\r\nsay that I have always been interested in psychical phenomena, and had\r\nread a number of books on the subject before the incident in Normandy,\r\nincluding Fifty Years of Psychical Research. Nevertheless I did not.\r\n208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAR.-APR. 1948\r\nindeed I do not, correlate my own experience with any that I can remember reading, though quite possibly I have read of such happenings,\r\nwhich may have unconsciously influenced my own interpretation of it. There is, however, one similar experience which I remember reading\r\nbefore the incident, and which made a certain impression upon me\u2014it was in an autobiographical travel book by a fairly well-known person\r\n(though I cannot recall the name, which, in itself, is no doubt significant).\r\nThis man travelled in Egypt investigating the powers of various mystics\r\nand holy men\u2014among his m^any interesting experiences was one in which\r\nhe spent the night in the inner chamber of the Great Pyramid of\r\nCheops(.'') or som.e such pyramid. He describes a dream or a vision in\r\nwhich he said he seemed to leave his body and float some twenty feet above it, though while he was so doing he was attached to it by a thin\r\nwhite(?) cord. I remember no such cord, though a curious characteristic\r\nof my experience was that at one time I seemed to be able to see the scene from a number of different viewpoints all at the same time. That is to\r\nsay, while I was floating above my body, I was conscious of doing so, and\r\nof the view about me including my own body on the ground, yet I was\r\nalso conscious of a much weaker (to use an inapt adjective) comprehension,\r\nand that was from the side, where I could make out both the ground body\r\nand also the airborne body, though that may well be due to efforts to\r\nvisualise the whole scene afterwards. The body on the ground was only\r\nconscious of the flames, and of the ui^gency of the moment.\r\n\" I was fully conscious of everything once I had landed in the field,\r\nthough I do not remember passing over the intervening hedge (some\r\nfour to five feet high). While floating in the air I was quite v\/ell aware of\r\nthe fact that the ground body was my own\u2014one moment I was above it, watching it and trying to help it by giving advice {i.e. roll over and over\r\nit's no use gibbering, etc.), the next I was the body on the ground, very\r\nvery frightened but quite in possession of my senses. I do not remember\r\nhow I got down again\u2014it must be realised that the whole incident was\r\nvery swift indeed.\r\n\"As to pain, though I was gibbering, it was more with fear\u2014I cannot\r\nrecall, any intense pain. The burns comprised petrol and phosphorus\r\nburns to both hands, forearms, face and head, and back. I was given\r\nmorphia, penicillin, plasma and all the usual impedimenta in the field hospitals\u2014skin grafts to my hand were made in England\u2014it took about\r\nsix months for everything to heal over again. \" I did not tell anyone of my experiences for about a year\u2014I spent most\r\nof my convalescence in the Wye Valley wandering about the Dean Forest\r\nin the daytime and arguing about philosophy in the night-time. \" I have no objection to quotation of this incident, though I should\r\nprefer that my name was not mentioned. I should like to emphasise that\r\nthough all I have written I believe to be a true statement of what I felt and\/or imagined at the time, the possibility of exaggeration, rationalisation,\r\netc., must not be overlooked, and I regret that I have no means of checking on the veracity of it, even to my own satisfaction.\"\r\nWhile it is impossible to obtain corroboration of an individual experience\r\nof this kind, one can compare the account with independent descriptions\r\nby other people who have been through similar experiences. The present\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 \" Oiit-of-the-Body \" Experience 209\r\ncase calls to mind many instances in which, during times of stress or\r\nillness, a person has had the feeling of being apart from his body and\r\nlooking down on the scene from a detached point of view. Very few of\r\nthose cases are recorded as clearly and fully as the one just quoted, but\r\nit may be of interest to mention one or two for purposes of comparison.\r\nThe next case is taken from a letter from Bombay, dated July 12th,\r\n1945, and addressed to the late Mr Kenneth Richmond. Mr Richmond\r\ngave the following details about the correspondent : \" He is a healthy man of about thirty. 1 have known him for fourteen\r\nyears and should say that he had no tendency to dissociation in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, and he has shown himself notably level-headed under\r\nconsiderable dangers and stresses. He was in excellent health before this very sudden attack of high fever.\"\r\nThe letter reads as follows : \"... I worked up a tem.perature of 105-2 in a matter of two hours and\r\nbefore I knew it I v\/as in hospital. Looking back on it, it was very\r\ninteresting. It seems I was only unconscious for ten minutes, the rest of the time I remember. All the time while my temperature was high some part of me stood by my bed and watched the rest of me. It was\r\nbad enough to require two male nurses to hold me on my bed and there\r\nI was, watching myself raving and struggling, and thinking that I never\r\nrealised dying was going to be so undignified. And I remember saying\r\nto myself, ' Pull yourself together\u2014you look a damn fool out of control\r\nas you are noyv.' And I remember pulling myself together for all I was\r\nworth, and yet my body just wouldn't keep still. And then the rigor\r\nstarted setting in and the Caryl by my bedside became really scared\r\nbecause it was nothing short of frightening to watch death start in your\r\nfingertips and gradually work his way up your arms and stop at the\r\nelbows, repeat the same thing from toes to knees and then start on your\r\njaw. After that I fell asleep and then the whole thing settled down to the disgusting anti-climax of dysentery. But for a couple of hours I was\r\nquite an interesting patient.\"\r\nAlthough no precise dates are given, it would appear that this description was v\/ritten fairly soon after the illness took place. This is an important\r\npoint, because dream-like experiences are as a rule not remembered in\r\ndetail, and the memory of them becomes less and less reliable as the\r\nmonths go by.\r\nThe next letter v\/as addressed to Dr Hugh Phillip (pseudonym) following\r\na broadcast talk in 1944 in which he mentioned a simdlar experience:\r\nJune sth, 1944\r\nDear Sir,\u2014Your postscript on Sunday, June 4th, was of interest to me in this way\u2014six years ago I had pneumonia and pleurisy combined,\r\ncaught owing to a chill out shooting. I had two nurses, and I remember\r\nthe doctor saying (whilst in my room) that he could do no more and I must\r\nfight it out myself. I cannot think I was supposed to hear this aside.\r\nWith what strength I had, I pinched myself and said \" You shall get\r\nbetter \". Now this w^as the crisis. I feel quite certain that I left my body.\r\nI felt it getting heavier and heavier and sinking into the bed. I was\r\nsitting on top of a high wardrobe near the door looking down on my bed\r\n2IO Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nat myself, and the nurse sitting by me. I was disgusted at my unshaven\r\nappearance. I saw everything in the room\u2014the mirror on the dressing\r\ntable and all small details. Fear was absent entirely. The next thing\r\nI remember was my nurse holding my hand and shortly afterwards heard\r\nher say, \" The crisis has passed.\"\r\nSome time after all this, I told the nurse what had happened to me,\r\ndescribed what she was doing at the time and the details of the room. She said I was given up and that it was because I was delirious.\r\nNo, I was dead for that time, but made myself go back.\r\nMy family did not quite believe all this and your talk last night has\r\nmade them change their minds. Hoping this will not bore you.\u2014Yours\r\nsincerely, (Colonel).\r\nThe next letter also was one of those sent to Dr HugJi Phillip after his\r\nbroadcast. In this case there was a great lapse of time between the event\r\nand its narration : <v ^ 7 jime 20th, 1944\r\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of the 20th arrived safely and I will repeat the story\r\nI wrote you on June 4th. As then, I must again ask you to forgive any\r\nmedical inaccuracies\u2014I am not a medical man and may well be wrong in some medical terms. I am drawing on a memory thirty-one years old.\r\nI was stationed in Aden in 19 13 and was seriously ill with dysentery.\r\nI got to the stage of having to be lifted from side to side as I was too weak\r\nto move myself in bed. From the instructions I heard the M.O. give\r\nthe orderlies (v\/e had no nurses in Aden then) I gathered that a collapse was expected and that in the event of that occurrence I was to be given a\r\nsaline injection via the rectum.\r\nShortly afterwards, I found myself lying parallel to the bed, about three or four feet above it and face downwards. Below me I saw my body and\r\nwitnessed the giving of the rectal injection. I listened to all the conversation of the two orderlies and of a strange M.O. who was directing affairs and was indeed a very interested spectator of the whole business. I remember well that the saline came from an enamel kind of vessel which was connected to a rubber tube\u2014the vessel being held up at arms' length\r\nby an orderly.\r\nI found myself next back in bed, feeling much better. I told my story\r\nto the orderlies who were quite sceptical. I particularly enquired about\r\nthe strange M.O. I found there had been one, he was en route for\r\nBombay, I think, and had called at the hospital in time to help. I never saw him again.\r\nI have always been convinced that my spirit (or soul if you will) had\r\nactually left my body but returned as a result of the injection. When\r\nkindred subjects have cropped up I have told friends of my experience.\r\nThey have listened in a tolerant fashion but I have always felt that my story was really being received \" with nods and becks and wreathed smiles \". You may imagine then how delighted I was to hear you narrate an almost\r\nsimilar experience\u2014and I sat down immediately and wrote to you. . . . On reading the above I find I have omitted to mention that the orderlies\r\nsaid I couldn't possibly have any knowledge of the matter as I was quite\r\nunconscious before and after the operation.\r\nI hope the story will be of some interest to you.\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Reviews 211\r\nFinally, here is a case sent to the Research Officer in 1946 by a lady\r\nmember of the Society. She writes : \" Some years ago my husband developed appendicitis for which he was\r\noperated on. He was on the point of recovery when a curious experience came his way.\r\n\" After I had had tea with my husband in the afternoon, the doctor, a\r\nlocal practitioner, who was in attendance and went daily to see my\r\nhusband, telephoned me to go with him to the hospital that evening. He\r\nsaid that quite suddenly my husband had collapsed, that although, through\r\ngreat presence of mind, the nurses had managed to revive him, he was\r\nstill in danger. It would appear that an embolism was suspected. \" On my arrival at the hospital\u2014Hampstead General\u2014we were then\r\nliving at Hendon, the Sister in charge told me that I could go into my\r\nhusband's room on condition that I did not say much to him as he could\r\nonly speak in a whisper and was still not out of danger. She said she had\r\nnever seen so complete a collapse followed by a revival, although she\r\ncould not yet say whether he would recover. He had been given oxygen\r\nbut his breathing was still bad.\r\n\" My husband said with difficulty and in a whisper : ' Did they tell you\r\nwhat happened? ' I said I merely understood that he had fainted. My\r\nhusband said, ' Oh, it was quite pleasant\u2014the nurses were washing me\r\nwhen I suddenly felt myself floating outside the hospital, thinking of\r\nnothing in particular\u2014but merely feeling very happy. The next thing\r\nI knew was that I was being \" pulled back \", with nurses round my bed\r\nlooking very worried, and being given oxygen.'\r\n\" My husband was not the slightest bit interested in psychical research,\r\nhad never, and still has never read on the subject. He is a graduate of\r\nLondon University\u2014his subject being Economics.\"\r\nREVIEWS\r\nTelepathy and Medical Psychology. By Jan Ehrenwald. London, 1948.\r\n(Allen and Unwin. 12s. 6d. net.)\r\nMany psychical investigators have felt the need for a bold speculative\r\ntheory which will make some sense of our scattered and baffling observations and provide some guidance for our researches. Dr Ehrenwald has\r\nput forward such a theory based on the principles of abnormal psychology.\r\nWhether or no we agree with Dr Ehrenwald's views, they deserve the\r\nclosest attention, for he is one of the few modern psychiatrists who has an\r\nintimate knowledge of both psychical research and the several schools of\r\npsycho-analysis.\r\nAfter an analysis of many typical examples, Dr Ehrenwald describes\r\nwhat he considers the important conditioning factors in the occurrence of\r\ntelepathy. In the agent, thoughts associated with emotional stress, and\r\nthoughts totally or partially repressed are the ones most readily \" trans- mitted \" by telepathy. Physiological as well as psychological crises in\r\nthe agent, by releasing activity from primitive strata of the central nervous\r\nsystem, may also favour thought transmission. This would explain the\r\n212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1948\r\nfrequency with which telepathic incidents are reported in connection with\r\nsudden or violent death.\r\nIn the percipient, the main determining factor is a deficiency of some\r\nmental (or sometimes phj'siological) function, for which the telepathic\r\nfaculty acts as a form of compensation. Favoured states for telepathic\r\npercipiency are dreams, disabilities of sense perception, hysterical dissociation (as in mediumistic trance), neurosis, and developing schizophrenia,\r\nespecially the variety accompanied by paranoid delusions.\r\nFrom these observations, Dr Ehrenwald is inclined to favour the idea\r\nthat telepathy is a primitive function, whereby unconscious strata of the\r\nmind become aware, in a vague way, of the content of another's thought.\r\nThe theory has much in common with Carington's \" Common Subconscious \", but Dr Ehrenwald envisages the individual personality being\r\nbuilt up, as it were, in opposition to the communal tendencies. Telepathic\r\ncommunion has a negative survival value and is more repressed where the\r\nindividual personality is better developed and integrated. In the\r\ninsanities, the personality is overwhelmed by an uncontrollable influx of\r\nmaterial from its own and other people's unconscious. The commonly\r\nobserved regression to primitive modes of thought in schizophrenia is, in\r\nDr Ehrenwald's opinion, accompanied by an equally primitive susceptibility to chaotic telepathic influences.\r\nThis thesis, here very inadequately sketched, forms a bold and\r\nfascinating conjecture. Flow near to the truth it comes we cannot judge\r\nuntil many more facts are avilable. We can, however, observe thstt the\r\nargument proceeds in steps, some of which are open to many doubts.\r\nFirstly, Dr Ehrenwald's theory relies upon information derived from\r\nspontaneous cases. But he takes pains to point out repeatedly that these\r\nincidents are incomparably lower in evidential value than the statistically\r\nassessed card-guessing experiments which have established the existence\r\nof telepathy. One gets the impression that if these card-guessing experiments had not shown a telepathic effect, Dr Ehrenwald would have\r\nwritten off the spontaneous cases as freaks of coincidence and misreporting.\r\nAs it is, he is able to accept them wholeheartedly, and bases his arguments on the analysis of individual incident\r\nThere is an obvious objection to this procedure. On the grounds of\r\nDr Ehrenwald's own statements, neither he nor anyone else can judge\r\nwith certainty what proportion of spontaneous \" psychic \" incidents are\r\nreally due to coincidence and other normal causes. If the card-guessing\r\nexperiments in this country could be taken as a guide, telepathy would be\r\nrare indeed. It may be that telepathy in the real life situation is common,\r\nbut in the absence of any yardstick, and in a field where individual judgments differ radically, it is impossible to be sure. In these circumstances,\r\ntheories based upon individual cases, which may or may not be psychic,\r\nare necessarily speculative, and require further confirmation.\r\nDr Ehrenwald's catalogue of conditions favouring telepathy must not\r\nbe accepted unquestioningly. He repeats the well-known claim that a\r\ncrisis in the agent, especially death, precipitates telepathic transmission.\r\nWhile it is perfectly true that crisis cases are a very common form of\r\nevidence for spontaneous telepathy, this is not in itself a proof that crisis conditions are a causal factor. It may be that trivial thoughts and events\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Reviews 213\r\nare just as commonly transmitted by telepathy, but because they are less striking and less \" evidential \" than crisis cases, they pass unnoticed and\r\nunreported. In a lesser degree, the same criticism is applicable to all the\r\nalleged favourable factors cited by Dr Ehrenwald. A case accompanied\r\nby emotional stress, or an abnormal condition in the percipient, is far more likely to attract attention than the effect of a stray thought entering\r\nthe mind of a normal person engaged on routine pursuits.\r\nAs evidence for his theory, Dr Ehrenwald brings forward the observation that the apparent phenomenon of telepathy is commonest in the\r\nabnormal percipient. He points out that belief in the \" omnipotence of\r\nthought \" is a feature common to the savage, the neurotic, the hysteric\r\nand the paranoid schizophrenic. But these are the very people whose\r\ntestimony is most open to suspicion. To some it will seem more than\r\nlikely that the frequency of psychic claims among these classes is evidence\r\nof nothing more than their unrehability.\r\nThese are all semi-theoretical objections. More important for a fair appraisal of Dr Ehrenwald's views is a consideration of the factual evidence\r\nwhich he quotes in their support. Herein, unfortunately, lies the weakest\r\nportion of the book. In Chapter II Dr Ehrenwald gives a highly\r\ncritical survey of the evidence for psychic phenomena. Paranormal\r\ncognition is almost the only phenomenon he will accept. He is not\r\nconcerned with the \" curious collection of manifestations, mental and\r\nphysical, which is put on show in the spiritualistic seance room for\r\nappropriate fees \". Spiritualism he describes as like \" a submerged\r\nprehistoric continent projecting into the world of today : a strange\r\nsample of primitive mentality \". The mediumistic trance is, in his view, an abnormal state in which the medium is particularly susceptible to telepathy from the sitter. \" The trance may work like a magic mirror, as\r\nit were, reflecting the lingering hopes and forlorn memories of those\r\nlooking into it . . . both the medium and the sitters are at complete liberty\r\nto indulge in their collective wish-dreams and phantasies, canalised by\r\nthe traditional spiritualist faith.\" Mrs Willett's famous descriptions of the\r\nnext world are in Dr Ehrenv\/ald's view hysterical hallucinations, coloured\r\nby ideas telepathically derived from the mind of the sitter, Lord Balfour.\r\nIn striking contrast to his sceptical attitude to the phenomena which he\r\ndisbelieves, the author accepts incidents as evidence of telepathy on what\r\none would imagine would be for him totally insufficient grounds. His\r\nchief example of telepathy compensating for a physiological disability is Prof. Neureiter's famous case of the backward girl, Ilga K. This girl was said to suft'er from word blindness. She could understand single\r\nletters, and could write sentences herself, but she was unable to read\r\nwords or phrases. Her mother and teacher discovered that if they read\r\nsomething to themselves, Ilga could then say what it was, apparently by\r\nreading their thoughts. Dr Ehrenwald appears to accept Neureiter's\r\nthought-reading interpretation without question. No mention is made of\r\nthe numerous later investigations of Ilga K. which showed that most, if not all, her phenomena were due to the picking up of auditory clues from\r\nher mother. In his very judicial summary of the case,^ Hans Bender\r\n^ \" The Case of Ilga K. \" by Hans Bender, Journal of Parapsychology (1938)\r\nII, pp. 5-22.\r\n214 ' Journal of Society for Psychical Research u.k'R.-hVR. 1948\r\nconcludes that \" Many as the unsolved problems of this case may be, it must no longer be cited as an example of genuine thought transference\r\nwhich has unavoidably occurred in consequence of v. Neureiter's report \". Few investigators will feel able to follow Dr Ehrenwald in his complete\r\ndisregard of this finding.\r\nIt is an important part of Dr Ehrenwald's theory that paranoia and\r\nschizophrenia are accompanied by a heightening of telepathic suceptibility.\r\nHe makes the striking suggestion that the characteristic delusions of\r\npersecution, and of mental influence from a distance, may contain an\r\nelement of genuine telepathy. He quotes the instance (p. 126) of a fellow\r\nmedical student named Leon who developed paranoid schizophrenia and\r\nbecame convinced that the writer was torturing him with telepathic\r\ninfluences. Dr Ehrenwald thinks there was some truth in Leon's belief,\r\nfor it was a fact that the author harboured mixed feelings towards him.\r\nSurely in these circumstances a simpler explanation than telepathy would\r\naccount for Leon focussing his persecutory ideas upon Dr Ehrenwald ; they were friends and it is reasonable to suppose that during social inter- course Leon detected the \" mixed feelings \" by perfectly normal means.^\r\nIn another case (p. 143) Dr Ehrenwald is accused by a schizophrenic\r\npatient of being responsible for the condition of a woman who had injured ^ herself trying to break out of hospital. The author thinks this may be\r\ndue to the schizophrenic sensing the thought at the back of his mind that\r\nhe had mishandled the woman. Presumably the author has quoted the\r\nmost cogent cases in his book, but if these are the best he can produce\r\nafter years of experience in mental hospitals, one may doubt whether the\r\ninsane >really do display apparent telepathy more frequently than the\r\nuncertified.\r\nDr Ehrenwald's enthusiasm for the telepathic hypothesis leads him to postulate a telepathic mechanism in situations where one would normally\r\nnot have considered it. He instances the fact (which laymen have long\r\nsuspected) that dreams often follow the pattern of the particular school\r\nof thought to which the patient's analyst happens to belong. He quotes\r\nthe example of John Layard's book The Lady of the Hare in which, by\r\nher dreams the \" patient seems to confirm all the claims of analytic\r\npsychology and in particular all the theories held by the author of the book.\r\n. . . No one but Layard himself could have possibly arrived at such an\r\ningenious reading of the case. The reason is obvious, the dreams dreamt\r\nby the Lady of the Hare are the joint product of the patient's and the\r\nanalyst's unconscious \"\r\n(p. loi). Most people would say that these cases were due partly to subtle suggestions passing from analyst to patient,\r\nwhereby the dreamer is made to accept the analyst's point of view and\r\ndream accordingly, and partly to the well-known tendency in recording\r\nand interpreting dreams to bring out only those points which fit in with a preconceived theory. Dr Ehrenwald postulates the additional factor of\r\ntelepathic rapport, and he thinks the same factor may account for the\r\ntendency of hypnotic subjects and hysterics to behave in conformity with\r\nthe ideas of their particular investigator. Strong evidence against this\r\ntelepathic theory is that in every case of this kind that has been investigated\r\nthoroughly it has been found that in the absence of normal clues and\r\n^ Precisely the same criticism applies to the case of Mr P. quoted on p. 128.\r\nMAR.-APR. 1948 Reviews 215\r\nsuggestive influences the investigator's ideas no longer affect the subject.\r\nSuch was the case in the so-called Reichenbach phenomena (detecting\r\nthe polarity of a magnet by alleged visible emanations), and in Dr Alrutz's\r\nobservations supporting the fluidic theory of mesmerism, which were\r\ninvestigated by Dr Thouless. If the psycho-analytical situation could be\r\ninvestigated with equal rigour, the same result would probably be obtained.\r\nTowards the end of the book, Dr Ehrenwald gives interesting psychiatric sketches of two subjects believed to possess psychic faculty. Two\r\ncases are not enough to draw any definite conclusion, but the author is right in placing them on record. The first is the famous medium, Mrs\r\nEileen Garrett, about whose supposed psychic faculties there are wide\r\ndifferences of opinion.^ The second is an anonymous card-guesser, Mr\r\n\" Scott \". Dr Ehrenwald has been kind enough to give me the real name\r\nof the percipient so that I could look up the reports on his work. I have no hesitation in saying that in this case the evidence for genuine psychic\r\npowers is extremely good.\r\nTo wind up this already too lengthy review, it must be pointed out that\r\nDr Ehrenwald's thesis may have hit the nail on the head, even though some of his supporting evidence is not always sound. Only time will tell whether the author's fate is to be cast into the limbo of forgotten\r\ntheorists, or hailed as a great thinker whose breadth of vision outshone\r\nhis contemporaries. Of one thing we may be sure, if Dr Ehrenwald's\r\nideas are something of an innovation to the psychical researcher,\r\nthey will seem even more startling to his colleagues of the orthodox\r\npsychiatric world.\r\n' D.

West\r\nThere are two main theories of dowsing, the physical and the psychical.\r\nExponents of the former point of view maintain that the process is a mechanical one. Water, metals and other things are detected by virtue\r\nof their physical properties. Emanations of one kind or another, which\r\nare given off by these substances, are supposed to affect the neuro-muscular\r\nmechanism of the diviner and result in the twitching of a rod held in the\r\nhand.\r\nAccording to the psychical theory, the process is a mental one. Movements of the divining rod are produced by subconscious muscular action,\r\nexactly as in the case of a planchette. When the responses occur at the\r\nright places, and the dowser had no normal knowledge of the whereabouts\r\nof what he was searching for, this is accounted for by paranormal\r\ncognition. A point strongly favouring the psychical theory is the fact that\r\nmovements of the rod or pendulum often follow the ideas and impressions\r\nof the diviner, rather than the true location of the object. The following\r\nexperiments illustrate this principle :\r\nOn November 28th, 1946, Mr John Higgins, a professional dowser,\r\nattended at the Society's rooms to demonstrate his powers. He claimed\r\nthat by using the appropriate twigs, he could successfully locate minerals,\r\ncoins, buried human remains and the site of disease as well as underground\r\nwater.\r\nEighteen similar wooden pill-boxes were provided. In one of them\r\nthere had been placed, prior to the experiment, a small piece of copper.\r\nNo one present knew which box had contained the metal. The boxes were spread over a large table, and Mr Higgins held his twig over each in turn. Over one particular box there was a marked response. This box was opened but it did not contain the copper. A further attempt was also\r\nwrong. The boxes were then all opened and the copper located. They\r\nwere taken to another room, shuffled in the dark, and one of them was\r\nloaded with a farthing. The boxes were again spread on the table, MrHiggins made his choice as before but was wrong once again. The boxes were reshuffled and one was again loaded with a farthing. They were\r\ntaken outside into the road, as Mr Higgins said he was much more successful when standing on damp ground. However, for the fourth time his\r\nchoice was wrong.\r\nMr Higgins then put a coin under one of the boxes and held his twig\r\nover it. There was no movement. He said that this showed that it was\r\nthe wood of the boxes which was causing his failures. He did not explain\r\nwhy, if this were so, definite movements were obtained over some of the\r\nboxes.\r\nMr Higgins then asked D. J. W. to hold out in front of him both fists clenched, with a copper coin in one. In these circumstances he was able\r\nto locate the coin successfully. He did this about five times in succession.\r\nD. J. W. then went out of the room, returning with his hands in his pockets, one hand containing a coin. While Mr Higgins was moving\r\nMAY 1948 Some Experiments in Divining 221\r\nround with his twig, D. J. W. carefully looked down with closed eyes so\r\nthat he could not tell which pocket the twig was indicating. This\r\nexperiment was performed twice and each time Mr Higgins was wrong.\r\nAs a last experiment Mr Higgins was sent out of the room. Eight people\r\npresent held out their clenched fists. One of the eight held a coin in one\r\nhand. Mr Higgins was brought back and asked to find the coin. When\r\nhe came to the hand containing the coin there were violent movements of\r\nhis twig, but he was not sufficiently confident to make a definite choice.\r\nThe last set of experiments strongly suggest that Mr Higgins, like other\r\ndowsers, was successful only when people present knew the location of\r\nthe coin and were in a position to give away normal indicia.\r\nSome rather similar experiments were carried out on April ist, 1948.\r\nD. J. W. was invited to witness the work of a well-known amateur dowser,\r\nMiss O. The house where the experiments took place was well supplied\r\nwith water-pipes, and the dowser began by strolling around the house\r\nand grounds finding water about everywhere. She then agreed to do some\r\ndowsing over teacups. A row of five cups was provided, one of which was filled with salt water. All five were covered over with saucers, and\r\nMiss O. was asked to try and locate the full cup. She obtained a strong\r\nreaction over the first cup, but not the others. Told that this was wrong,\r\nshe then got a reaction over another cup, but this was wrong too. Miss O. thought it might be the fact that the cups were covered over which caused the failures. D. J. W. therefore arranged another five cups\r\nwithout saucers, four containing plain water and one containing salt water, indistinguishable from the others in appearance. Miss O. was\r\ngiven a cup which she was told was plain water, to make sure that this\r\nwould give no reaction. Miss O. then dowsed over the five cups one by\r\none. Once again a reaction was obtained over a particular cup, but it was the wrong one. When she was told which was the right cup, she\r\ntried again, and this time got a reaction where previously she had none.\r\nClearly this was due to knowledge of the true location, and not to a mechanical response. . - ,\r\nNot all dowsers use twigs or pendulums. Some people say they can\r\nfeel \" vibrations \" directly. Such was the case with Dr X., who contacted\r\nthe Society recently, and v\/ho had a young lady assistant who was said to be able to detect \" vibrations \" from the hum^an body. These vibrations were supposed to have a focal point or critical distance, which would alter according to the subject's state of health. It would also alter if the\r\nsubject held in the hands bacterial culture of an organism with which he was infected.\r\nDr X.'s assistant discovered a culture which she said aitected the\r\nvibrations from D. J. W. The experiment was then tried of having\r\nD. J. W. hold behind his back sometimes this active culture and sometimes one v\/hich had no efi^ect. The lady moved her hand about to feel the vibrations. In these circumstances she was unable to distinguish\r\nbetween the active culture and the control culture. At a similar experiment at the Society's rooms on March nth, 1948, the lady tried to pick\r\nout two active cultures from amongst ten controls. Both her choices\r\n222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1948 were wrong. When the experiment was repeated with the labels of the\r\ncultures in view, she was right both times.\r\nIf the effects were really due to the physical causes to which they were\r\nattributed, it is extraordinary that they should be so often detected wrongly\r\nwhen the diviner was shut off from normal clues.\r\n. AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO LOCATE\r\nWATER BY DIVINATION\r\n- By Allen J. Sharp and Denis B. Cameron\r\nIn an effort to establish with reasonable certainty the existence of waterdivining as such, the present authors organised on behalf of the King's\r\nCollege Society for Psychical Research a field test which took place on\r\nthe afternoon of April 7th, 1948, near the village of Matfen in Northumberland.\r\nThe site was carefully chosen, being a field of about 1\r\n1 1 acres, across which, at a depth averaging 23 feet, was a concrete tunnel, 6 feet in diameter, carrying almost 10 million gallons of water a day, from the\r\nNorthumbrian reservoirs to Newcastle. The tunnel had been driven\r\nthrough all the way and therefore showed no surface indications of its presence, nor did it follow the lines of natural drainage and could not\r\ntherefore be predicted from any geological considerations. The outlet was completely obscured by some 200 yards of plantation, the only other\r\nsurface marker being an air shaft, situated in another plantation more than\r\nhalf a mile away and itself largely obscured by nearer trees. The two persons knowing the location of the tunnel on the map were\r\nunable to fix its position in the field with complete accuracy. The\r\nonly maps in existence apart from that which had been prepared by\r\nus were in the hands of the chief engineer of the Newcastle and Gateshead\r\nWater Company, Mr S. Barrett. We engaged for the occasion two professional diviners. The first was Mr T. W. Davison of Coanwood, near Haltwhistle, a well-known local dowser who had had some success in informal experiments in coin lo- cation with the authors of the present report. We took him with us from\r\nNewcastle and not until we had almost reached Matfen was he informed\r\nof our destination. The party assembled at one corner of the field and\r\nthe diviner was set off along a diagonal having been told that at some\r\npoint he would cross the tunnel. He was accompanied by Dr D. J. West, Research Officer of the S.P.R., a photographer, and one of our\r\nsurveyors carrying pegs to mark the points which he indicated. The rest of the party, which included Dr Robertson of the Geological Survey of\r\nGreat Britain, Professors Poole and Hickling of King's College, Newcastle, heads of the departments of Mining and Geology respectively, and\r\nrepresentatives of the press, followed at a discreet distance. Having fixed\r\nhis first point the diviner then marked out what he believed to be the course of the tunnel. The position of the pegs was immediately fixed by\r\nthe surveyors, the first diviner taken from the field and the ground cleared\r\nbefore the arrival of our second diviner. He, Mr M. Watson of Greyside\r\nnear Hexham, had been instructed by letter the previous day to take a bus\r\nMAY 1948 Unsuccessful Attempt to Locate Water 223\r\nto a nearby village where our car would meet him and bring him to the\r\nsite.The procedure was much the same as before and having completed his\r\ntest, Mr Watson returned immediately to Hexham. Mr Davison had,\r\nhowever, pointed out that he had never attempted to find a tunnel before\r\nand while from the outset he made no claims in this direction, he guaranteed\r\nto find any pipeline. As there were none in the immediate vicinit}' of\r\nMatfen we had arranged in the event of his not finding the tunnel to mo\\'e\r\nthe whole party to a nearby waterworks at Whittle Dene.\r\nIt should be remarked that at this stage of the test while the diviners'\r\nlocations had not been accurately plotted they were sufficiently far wrong\r\nto be obviously incorrect.\r\nAt the waterworks we used a further six locations, the details of which\r\nwe do not consider of sufficient importance to record here in view of the\r\ndiviner's continued failure. On two occasions he was within a yard of\r\nthe correct location but we believe that this was well within the\r\nrange of chance coincidence.\r\nIt may, however, be of interest to add that a member of the part)-,\r\nMr Alec Mapletoft, a civil engineer and himself an amateur diviner,\r\nworking independently under the super\\'ision of Dr Robertson and\r\nMr Barrett, obtained reactions with his twig over the identical spots\r\nindicated by Mr Davison. On the occasions when he knew the spot to have been previously selected the effect was probably pure suggestion,\r\nbut on certain occasions he could not have seen the diviner and the pegs\r\nhad already been removed. We do not consider this to be of evidential\r\nimportance as the fact did not come to the knowledge of the authors of\r\nthis report until after the test. In conclusion, therefore, the following points seem outstanding. Both\r\ndiviners completely failed to find a large tunnel carrying a very considerable\r\namount of water. One was equally unsuccessful on a number of pipe\r\nlines varying from 12 inches to 33 inches in diameter.\r\nOne feels bound to ask the question, \" Was this failure due to the fact that the precautions which we took and the site which we chose eliminated\r\nall possible clues?\"\r\nA NOTE ON THE MASS-OBSERVATION QUESTIONNAIRE ONHALLUCINATIONS\r\nBy D. J. West\r\nIn the report which appeared in the March-April issue of the Journal it was pointed out that the figure given for the percentage of persons who\r\nhad experienced hallucinations was probably exaggerated, due to a ten- dency to select for questioning people who would be likely to give positive answers.\r\nProfessor Dodds has suggested that an indication of the extent of this error could be obtained by comparing the frequency of positive replies\r\namong the members of the Mass-Observation panel with the frequency\r\namong friends of panel members. If the latter frequency were dis-\r\n224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY 1948\r\nproportionately large it would suggest that panel members had picked out\r\nfriends who were more likely to answer \" yes \" than \" no \". The comparison has been made, with the following result :\r\nNumber of persons claiming\r\nhallucinations\r\nNumber of persons\r\ndisclaiming\r\nhallucinations\r\nMembers of\r\npanel 93 397\r\n(total 490)\r\nFriends of\r\npanel members\r\n(total 1029)\r\n124 905\r\nClearly, there is a higher percentage of affirmative answers among the\r\npanel members than among those whose replies came second-hand, which\r\nis contrary to what one would expect if there were a positive selection\r\nfactor. This result does not prove that the questionnaire has not overestimated\r\nthe frequency of hallucinations. It may be that there was a selection\r\nfactor among the panel members themselves. It is possible that many of\r\nthose who had had no hallucinations did not reply at all. Several features may have contributed to the production of a relatively\r\nhigh frequency of negative replies among the panel's friends. For instance,\r\nthey may not have had the same interest in the questionnaire, and have\r\nanswered more carelessly, without trying to recollect experiences of long\r\nago. Among them were a few groups of people, e.g. lecture classes, every\r\nmember of which returned a negative reply. These replies may have been\r\ninfluenced by the attitude of the questioner.\r\nThe questionnaire result was intended only as a very rough estimate.\r\nThe errors were numerous, but on the whole they tended to cancel each\r\nother out. I fancy that if a larger-scale census were taken by the British\r\nInstitute of Public Opinion, for example, the result would not be very\r\ndiff'erent.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nRandom Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments\r\nSir,\u2014An uninformed reader might easily draw from the article by Mr\r\nWilson in the last number of Proceedings and from Dr Soal's review of\r\nRhine's new book in the Journal the erroneous conclusion that the only\r\nvalid method of testing extra-sensory perception is by the use of a randomised pack of cards or series of numbers, and that all tests done with\r\npacks such as those used by Rhine and his associates with a fixed number\r\nof each kind of card in the pack are necessarily invalid. On the contrary,\r\nany kind of original material can give valid results if it is assessed by\r\ncorrect methods ; what one must avoid is error due to the use of a\r\nMAY 1948 CoiTcspondence 225\r\nmethod of assessment assuming a distribution different from that actuallv\r\nemployed.\r\nDr Soal points out that, in order to employ the binomial distribution\r\nformula, one must obtain a mathematically random sequence of card\r\nsymbols. Perhaps he assumes rather more statistical knowledge in his\r\nreaders than many of them have when he omits to mention : (i) that this\r\nnecessity arises only in connection with the variance and not with the\r\nmean chance expectation which will be exactly five in a Zener (5 \u2022-.5) pack (although not necessarily in a randomised pack), (2) that the error in\r\ncalculating the variance for a (5 5) pack from the binomial formula will be in the direction of over-estimating the variance and consequently of\r\nunder-estimating the significance of any deviation, so the validity of any\r\nresult found significant by this method will not be affected, (3) that such\r\nerror will only occur if the subjects deviate widely from equal guesses of\r\nthe symbols and in practice is found to be veiy small (in my Glasgow\r\nrepetition in 1939 of Rhine's experiments\r\n\r\nProceedings, xlv, Part 159\r\nI found a standard error of 1-93 which does not differ significantly from\r\nthe value of 2-00 expected from the binomial distribution) and, (4) that if\r\nit were important to avoid this error, this could easily be done either by\r\nusing the empirical variance or by calculating the variance theoretically\r\nby a more complex method which took into account the actual distribution\r\nof the subject's guesses. Since the direction of error is such that it might\r\nlead one (if it were of appreciable size) to miss a real effect but not to conclude that there was a real effect when really there was none, it is understandable that those who have used non-randomised packs have\r\nused the variance based on the binomial distribution. This in no way\r\naffects the validity of their results. Mr Wilson seems to go further since he says that, for the statistics to be valid, the probability of any event occurring must be independent of\r\nany previous events. Taken in its context this seems to imply that even\r\nthe mean chance expectation will not be five with a Zener pack of finite\r\nsize. This is plainly wrong. The chance expectation may not be five with a randomised pack, hence the necessity for the use of Stevens'\r\nmethod, but the necessity does not arise if there are five of each symbol in\r\nthe pack since the mean chance expectation is then always five and is unaffected by how the subject distributes his guesses over the five symbols.\r\nIt is necessary, of course, that the subject should not be told his successes, but this is never done now. The method originated by Soal of having randomised packs may have\r\nadvantages which outweigh its inconveniences. Mr Wilson's ingenious\r\nmachine may also have advantages, but I think it is a mistake to commend\r\nwhat may be a real improvement in method by exaggerating the defects of\r\nother simpler methods. This is certainly done when it is suggested that\r\nthe statistics used in these simpler methods are invalid.\r\nYours etc.,\r\n, . \" R. H. Thouless\r\n226 \/ I- Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1948\r\nResult of the Prize Offer to Physical Mediums\r\nSir,\u2014I am prompted by the notes on \" The Result of the Prize Offer\r\nto Physical Mediums \" in the January issue of the Journal to voice some\r\nof my misgivings over methods and conditions of research.\r\nIf we read this report, we get an impression that alleged physical\r\nmediums are either afraid of being investigated, or else that they are too\r\nsuperior to condescend. Actually, I suggest, they may be using commonsense in refusing, in some cases, to be lured into a completely false position.\r\nGranted that there may be some deliberate and conscious frauds\r\namong them, as well as some others who may be unconscious of their\r\ntrickery. But there are in fact very few mediums, if any, in this country,\r\nwho can produce genuine physical phenomena even under the best\r\nconditions. It is quite another matter, and merely adding to the uncertainties of their exhibitions, to put them under test conditions. It is obviously absurd to make the claim that the mediums are \" allowed to\r\nsit uncontrolled and under their own conditions \". A smattering of\r\npsychological understanding shows that this is not so. For even if the\r\nmedium is not stripped and searched, and is allowed to sit in his own\r\nrooms, there are matters involved which should be quite obvious to the\r\nmerest beginner in psychological and psychical studies. For instance,\r\nhow can it be said that the conditions are of the medium's own making,\r\nwhen he knows he is under test? Consciously, he may accept the test. But this does not mean that he is not nervous and tense under the surface,\r\nhence, in a condition which will make dissociation into trance more diffi- cult, and tend to inhibit the occurrence of phenomena. And this must\r\nipso facto hold good even when the crudities of infra-red telescopes and\r\nthe like are not used.\r\nThen there is the state of mind of the investigator himself : a thing\r\nwhich many sensitive people complain of. For if a person be psychically\r\nsensitive, he must be affected by this. And unless the investigator is thoroughly well trained in self-awareness, and unless he has the truly open\r\nmind only to be found among few people, it is quite natural that the\r\nmedium should shy away from the kind of mental pressure to which he\r\nfinds himself being submitted.\r\nThis may make it appear as if I were defending the medium and\r\ndecrying the critical attitude. This is not so. But what I am trying to say\r\nis that the non-occurrence of phenomena may be due, not to any failure of\r\nthe medium, but to the failure of the investigator to pay enough attention\r\nto the conditions he himself creates. Hence we have a self-cancelling\r\nsystem in which positive results would be surprising.\r\nIn short, the medium who refuses to be investigated may in fact show\r\nmore understanding of psvchic matters than either those who lend themselves to it, or than the investigator himself.\r\nThen there is another matter which worries me, and that is the casual\r\nway in which some research workers rush in where angels would rightly\r\nfear to tread, considering the damage which may result from their\r\ninvestigations. I recently had a letter asking me to send in the names of\r\nany people who might be willing to be hypnotised for investigation\r\npurposes. I firmly but, I hope, politely declined, giving my reasons for\r\nMAY 1948 Correspondence 227\r\nthis\u2014such reasons as are well-known to people versed in psychopathology\r\nand psychiatry, but apparently not to the investigator in question. I share the view of Dr William Brown among others, that hypnosis is a therapeutic method to be used only in a few cases for which it is suitable\r\nand for which other methods are unsuccessful. The test, anyhow, is whether the patient becomes more integrated, and hence less easy to hypnotise each time. I therefore consider it unethical to hypnotise\r\npeople merely to satisfy one's curiosity. For hypnosis is like surgery :\r\nit may have to be used for therapeutic ends. But, like surgery, it does\r\nharm to the patient : it dissociates him. If a person can be hypnotised,\r\nhe must be of the type which dissociates easily. Hence, hypnosis is likely to make active, or to aggravate, latent hysteria. The excuse that the victim\r\nlends himself willingly is not valid, for the simple reason that he does not\r\nrealise what is being done to him, and is probably, by the xtry nature of\r\nhis make-up, unconscious of the results on himself. IVIoreover, he probably\r\ntakes it for granted that the person who makes use of him would not do\r\nanything harmful to him.\r\nThese are examples of matters which lead either to waste of time and\r\nenergy or else to unjustifiable damage to people. And both are based on\r\nlack of psychological understanding. I contend that no person should\r\nventure beyond the outermost fringes of experimental psychical research\r\n{i.e. experiments in precognition, etc., under normal conditions and in\r\nfull consciousness) without a very thorough groundwork in psychopathology. -\"Vnd even further, I should not consider a person either\r\nuseful or safe in this field unless he himself were very thoroughly aware\r\nof himself and had undergone a course of self-analysis under the tuition\r\nof a reputable psychotherapist.\r\nYours etc.,\r\nLaurence J. Bendit, M.D., D.P.M.\r\nSir,\u2014I am obliged to Dr Bendit for letting me see his letter. He\r\nsuggests that the failure of the physical mediums to produce results in\r\nrecent seances at the Society's headquarters may be due to the attitude of\r\nthe investigator. Other members have formed a similar opinion. Mrs\r\nRichmond, writing to me with reference to Mrs Seccombe, one of the\r\nmediums tested, says : \" I am glad you did not know I was a friend [of Mrs Seccombe], as you would then have kindly let me know what was going forward, and l think, as her friend, I would have had to advise her not to come as it was\r\na foregone conclusion that no results of a satisfactorv nature would result. \" 1 would like to try and explain that statement. I know you are\r\nperfectly sincere, consciously, in your desire to find out the truth, and get\r\nresults, if they are to be got\u2014but it seems more than likely that you will never get any results till you become aware of your very strong unconscious\r\ndesire not to get any. This, of course, can influence results whether you\r\nare actually present or not. You are conducting the experiments, so vour\r\nunconscious will affect the mediums, in a telepathic way, whether in the\r\nroom with them or not. \" You know how useless it is trying to make a Fascist or anti-Semitic\r\n228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1948\r\nperson see reason, consciously ; their prejudice is so strong, it is like trying to argue with a gramophone record\u2014you simply can't make them\r\nsee. Well, it seems something of this order happens unconsciously\r\nbetween mediums and many Research Officers, and nothing happens.\r\nIn neither case, no results! PerJiaps, in both cases, there is a slight negative\r\nresult in that antagonism is aroused. I know I felt definitely hostile when\r\ndiscussing Jews with a confirmed anti-Semite. But luckily unconscious\r\nprocesses are not obvious and I'm sure you and Mrs Seccombe parted in\r\na most friendly manner.\r\n\" I hope you Vv^on't mind my frankness. I can't help feeling that some members will get ' fed up ' if our Research Officer never gets a;iy results.\r\nIt all seems such waste of time and money.\" . '\r\n;\r\nI do not think that in the case of physical mediums these conclusions\r\nare justified by the facts. Mr William Roy, one of the mediums in\r\nquestion, produced considerable trumpet movements and \" voices \" at a seance at the International Institute for Experimental Metaphysics at which I was present. The circle there contained a much higher proportion of sceptically-minded persons than the circle with which Mr Roy\r\nsat at the Society. The same medium has been able to give public\r\ndemonstrations of the \" direct voice \" from inside a dark cabinet on the\r\ntheatre stage. The audience at these performances must sometimes contain people who are really antagonistic, but the \" trance state \" comes\r\nand the \" voices \" are heard promptly and infallibly.\r\nThe precautions taken by the investigators, not their state of mind, is the cause of the stoppage of \" phenomena \". Dr Bendit further suggests that the mere taking of precautions, and the\r\nfact that the medium knows he is under test, may be suflicient to prevent\r\nany result. If this were true, it would be impossible to investigate\r\nphysical mediums at all, except by introducing tests surreptitiously, a procedure that would be open to the criticism that it involved deceiving\r\nand trapping the medium. Dr Bendit suggests no alternative. Fortunately,\r\nI don't think the proposition is true. Those mediums who have had the\r\nbest claim to paranormal physical powers have been able to withstand all kinds of tests. Rudi Schneider, for instance, cheerfully submitted to endless appliances and precautions without his phenomena being inhibited.\r\nHe also sat happily with many sceptics, although his control objected to Dr William Brown who, apparently, is one of those Dr Bendit would\r\nhave thought most suitable.\r\nOf course, it would be senseless not to try to put mediums at their ease and adjust the conditions of the seance to what they like best. I fully\r\nagree, and this is always done. Mediums who visit the Society are invariably treated as privileged guests, their comfort and refreshment is a first consideration, and everything possible is done to promote a friendly\r\natmosphere. I do not think that conscientious and sincere investigators\r\nneed do more than this. The more subtle influences postulated by Dr\r\nBendit and Mrs Richmond may be no more than subtle excuses to escape\r\nthe obvious fact that the physical medium cannot substantiate his claims.\r\nDr Bendit says there are few mediums, if any, in this country, who\r\ncan produce genuine physical phenomena. Does this mean he believes\r\nAL\\Y 1948 Correspondence 229\r\nthe numerous physical mediums who give seances in London and in spirituaUst circles all over the country- are fraudulent? If so, I would\r\nsubmit that if Dr Bendit were investigating he would be just as likely to subject a medium to adverse \" mental pressure \" as any of those who\r\nwere present at the S.P.R. sittings.\r\nWhile on the subject of the investigation of Air Roy and other\r\nphysical mediums, I should like to take this opportunity to correct an\r\nextraordinary rumour which several people tell me they have heard in\r\nspiritualist circles. According to this rumour, Air Roy was stripped and\r\nshaved and generally treated very unsympathetically. It is said that there\r\nAvas an interruption in the middle of the sitting and that he sustained\r\ninjury.\r\nThe facts are these : Mr Roy was neither stripped nor searched, but\r\ncame in and sat down in his ordinary clothes. Two spiritualists from\r\nLeeds who wanted to make enquiries were admitted by the caretaker and\r\nwere show^n into a room next door to the seance room. Hearing a seance\r\nbeginning, and wanting ver\\' much to attend it, thev tapped on the door.\r\nI said, \" Go away, we are engaged.\" The medium was not yet in a\r\ntrance. That is all. Later, during the seance. Air Roy slumped forward\r\nolf his chair on to the ground. He said afterwards a chair with arms would have prevented this, but at the com.mencement, when he was\r\nasked if there was anything he wanted, he made no request of this kind.\r\nHe told us at the time that apart from this the conditions had been\r\nperfectly satisfactor}\".\r\nThe second part of Dr Bendit's letter refers to my recent appeal for\r\nvolunteers to be hypnotised for investigation purposes. Admittedly, the\r\nindiscriminate use of hypnotic suggestion with persons with an abnormal\r\ntendency to dissociation would be most reprehensible, but the present\r\nexperiments are being conducted by persons with psychological training,\r\nand such obvious mistakes would be avoided.\r\nDr Bendit's point seems to be that all hypnosis is dangerous, and that\r\nit is unethical to employ it except for therapeutic purposes. I do not\r\nagree, and neither would a great many psychiatrists. Investigations in\r\nnon-therapeutic hypnotism have been conducted at the Alaudsley hospital\r\nand elsewhere by psychiatrists themselves. There is a vast literature on\r\nhypnotism, much of it vv ritten by psychologists and psychotherapists, but one would need to look very far before finding a statement of Dr Bendit's\r\nopinion on the harmfulness of hypnosis.\r\nHypnotism as a subject for investigation is laid down as falling within\r\nthe province of the Society's work. I venture to suggest that, had it not\r\nbeen for the experiments of Edmund Gurney and other investigators into\r\nhypnotism, which were certainly not motivated bv idle \" curiosity \",\r\nmuch of the psychopathology which Dr Bendit finds so useful w'ould not\r\nhave come into being.\r\nI agree that training in psychology- is essential for a psychical researcher.\r\nDr Bendit goes further and urges a course of analysis. Here, perhaps, he\r\nshows the specialist's partiality for his own particular branch of work.\r\nFrom meeting and discussing with people who have subjected themselves\r\n23\u00b0 Journal of Society fw Psychical Research may 1948\r\nto one school of analyst or another, I am not convinced that they always\r\ncome out of their experience better able to deal with .psychological matters.\r\n. . Yours etc.,\r\n, '\r\n. D. J. West\r\nA Significant Book Test\r\nSir,\u2014Having read the account in the December Proceedings by the\r\nRev. C. Drayton Thomas, I am by no means convinced of its being \" A\r\nSignificant Book Test \". While it might reasonably be called remarkable,\r\nits apparent significance is obviously due to the presentation rather than\r\nto the evidence, which, I believe, is in fact purely general.\r\nThe Loose Page\r\nFeda states, \" There used to be something kept in the book that could\r\nbe slipped in and out.\" The medium already knew that the book had\r\nmarginal notes, and it would be safe to say that in nine cases out of ten,\r\nsuch a book would also have been used as a depository for letters and\r\nclippings. At a subsequent sitting Feda adds, \" There was a loose page,\r\nand he thinks it was not quite the same size as the other pages. There\r\nwas a dissimilarity, and was it not of a difi^erent texture, a different class\r\nof paper too?\u2014It was just placed in, but did not really belong to it. If\r\nyou felt its surface you would know at once that it was not really part of\r\nthe book.\" All this information is merely inferential upon the previous\r\nassumption that the book contained a letter or cutting.\r\nFeda continues, \" Has it got creased or folded? \" This would be\r\ngenerally applicable particularly in the case of a letter. Now we come to the \" important \" passage, \" He says lines going the opposite way to the\r\nbook, . . .\" If we consider this for a moment it is quite obvious. Since\r\nthe most popular size of paper is quarto, which will not go flat into the\r\naverage book, it is usual to fold it longways and insert it with the writing\r\nopposite to the direction of the type.\r\nFeda also states, \" I wondered whether he had numbered the page ; for there is something in his mind about a number. He thinks that when\r\nyou look at it you will say ' I wonder why this was put in here '.\" Many\r\npeople number the pages of a letter, and it is also conceivable that a\r\ncutting would be numbered on the spot as a reference for future insertion.\r\nNow Feda says, \" There should be something on it which is not strictly\r\nconnected with the book. Something is, but something is not.\" This\r\nwould be a safe prediction in the case of a cutting, as the opposite side\r\nwould probably be quite irrelevant. With a letter the chances would be\r\nfairly even.\r\nThe Coloured Sheets .\r\n\u2022\r\n'\r\nFeda says, \" Inside the book are two coloured sheets, as if the paper was either of two qualities, or faded and tinted a little ; on opening\r\nthe book you distinctly see this deeper shade.\" Most books published\r\nabout this period, and especially collections of poems, have coloured\r\nflyleaves, . . . .\r\nMAY 1948 Correspondence 231\r\nThe Proximity to Tennyson\r\nFeda, \" Tennyson, has it been put near the works of Tennyson, or has\r\nAunt been thinking a good deal of Tennyson lately ? \" Tennyson\r\nbeing a standard work would be most likely to occur in a collection of\r\nbooks including Bvron. On my own book shelves the two stand only a few inches apart.\r\nThe Illustrations\r\nFeda : \" Uncle Alfred has an idea that this book has illustrations ; he\r\nremembers some of them. Byrons are not usuall} illustrated.\" The\r\nlatter remark is not strictly true. Most collections of poems at least bear\r\na frontispiece.\r\nTo test the points which I have made I selected at random a rather\r\nantiquated manual of geology which I recollected as having marginal\r\nnotes. Following the points set out by the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas :\r\n1 . The volume had two pages of a colour different from the rest (blue\r\nflyleaves), also illustrations (hardly a fair comparison in this instance)\r\nand a special inserted page (a cutting on limestone formation).\r\n2. One page was of a size different from those of the book and of\r\nanother texture (the cutting).\r\n3. It had been creased or folded.\r\n4. Some of the writing ran in a direction other than that of the book (a\r\nnote had been pencilled along the margin of the cutting) and,\r\n5. alluded to a subject not strictly connected with geology (some\r\nmathematical problems on the opposite side of the cutting).\r\n6. There was a number on this page (a reference for insertion).\r\nHad the information been spontaneous it might have been counted\r\nsignificant, but it must be remembered that the medium had almost three\r\nweeks in which to think out these apparently evidential but actually\r\nobvious facts. Yours etc., Allen J. Sharp\r\nEmergence of a Pseudo-Personality\r\nSir,\u2014In the Journal for February last, Mrs Heywood describes a\r\nsitting with the trance medium Edith Thompson. Her account deserves\r\ncareful study, for in the space of two and a half pages she has given us\r\ninstructive illustrations of almost all the known defects of reports on\r\nsittings with mediums.\r\nMrs Heywood arranged the sitting in order to try to obtain information\r\nabout a German friend called Rupert, from whom she had not heard\r\nsince the war. The medium gave some messages which seemed to come\r\nfrom this friend. Some attempts were made to give the name of the\r\ncommunicator. First the name \" Robin \" was tentatively put forward.\r\nLater the control said \" The name is R\u2014there's a P\u2014Rupert\". Mrs\r\nHeywood remarks that this was with \" no help whatever from me \",\r\nalthough ten lines previously she reported that she used the words \" You\r\nmust remember, Rupert, that I cannot see you \".\r\n232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY 1948\r\nDoubtless this astonishing lapse was a slip of the pen, which Mrs\r\nHeywood overlooked ; but a similar slip of the tongue during the course of the sitting might just as easily have passed unnoticed. It does not so much matter how such m.istakes arise : that they do arise at all is in itself sufficient to make the rest of the materia! suspect. In this particular case we are fortunate to be able to detect the error ; but one can hardly dare\r\nto wonder how many similar but undetectable errors may remain hidden\r\nin such a report.\r\nMrs Heywood says the sitting was a long one and she only noted the\r\nsalient points. It is, therefore, a fair assumption that there were many\r\nitems not quoted which the sitter did not place. This fact alone takes\r\nawa) from the report all its value as a piece of scientific evidence. Every\r\ninvestigator knows that it is the small details of a sitting, the unobtrusive\r\nsteps, leading up to the main successes, which are most revealing. What at the time seem salient points are not necessarily representative of the sitting as a whole. It is impossible to judge selected statements removed from\r\ntheir context. Let us examine the points noted bv Mrs Heywood, and see how many\r\nof them appear by common sense standards to be indisputably paranormal. First there is the statement about a young man, Robert, who\r\npassed over as a result of chest trouble. But this is nothing unusual : I know someone who fits that description\u2014except that he was not particularly young when he died.\r\nThe name \" Rupert \" did not come as a iirst shot. Robin was the first attempt. Maybe there was something in the way the sitter rece!\\\"ed this\r\nname that told the medium she was somewhere near the mark, so that she\r\ncame out with R\u2014P\u2014Rupert as a likely guess. The communicator\r\nremarked that he had time for contemplation in the next world and talked\r\nabout time being an illusion : but these are commonplaces in spirit\r\nphilosophy and not evidence of identity. That the sitter had a letter from\r\nthe communicator in her handbag would be likely to be true of a high\r\npercentage of ladies who come to consult a medium. A wall or protection\r\nround a garden (it is Mrs Heywood, not Mrs Thompson, who puts the\r\ngarden in the U.S.A.), walks by the river and being fond of music are all so common that even in combination they add little or nothing to the\r\nevidence. The description of Rupert's personal appearance and his\r\nmanner of death were both wrong. The point about something spilt on a carpet was not placed.\r\nThe reference to walking a plank is the first interesting item ; it recalled\r\nto Mrs Heywood an incident in which the phrase would be reasonably\r\napplicable. Of course we can all place situations of this kind, but not\r\nperhaps with a particular friend taken at random. It is noticeable,\r\nhowever, that this statement was preceded by the item about walks by a\r\nriver. The fact that the sitter had not refused the preliminary statement\r\nmade the second item less improbable. This item and the allusion to the\r\nletter P in the surname are about the most specific, but selected from a \" long sitting \" they are utterly inconclusive. \u2022 \" Stefan, a rebel against tyranny \" was a reasonable guess after Mrs\r\nHeywood had acknowledged some foreign associations. The description\r\nfitted the man Mrs Heywood had in mind particularly well, but this point\r\nM.W' 1948 Correspondence 233\r\nhas little value when the medium's statement would have been true to some extent (and would no doubt have been marked successful) for\r\nalmost all Europeans with English friends.\r\nThe names \" Grace, Cicely, and Natalie \", said gropingly, of which the\r\nlast happened to fit, are of little interest except, perhaps, to show how\r\nmediums fit their guesses to the type of sitter they are dealing with. A\r\ndifferent class of sitter would probably have had something more like \" Mary, Doris, Joan \". Presumably Mrs Heywood assented to the name\r\nNatalie, after which the medium felt confident enough to assert that she was \" with Rupert \". Nowhere does Mrs Heywood tell us whether the sitting was booked\r\nanonymously, or whether it was her first sitting, or whether in her\r\nconversation with the medium she mentioned that she travelled about\r\nEurope. Mrs Heywood does admit that she mentioned her husband, and\r\ntowards the end of the sitting the medium came out with the name\r\n\" Poppet \" and later with the statement \" Frank (the husband) is Poppet \". Now Poppet is not a very uncommon nickname. It so happens that I know a lady who calls her husband by that name. Once Mrs Heywood\r\nhad acknowledged Poppet, it was a reasonable chance that it referred to her husband. The item would be stronger if we could be assured that\r\nPoppet was a name genuine^ associated by Mrs Heywood with her\r\nhusband (not just something she happened to call him on an odd occasion)\r\nand that Mrs Thompson had never seen her with her husband and heard\r\nthe name in conversation.\r\nAlthough the sitting might be held to justify further investigation, Mrs\r\nHeywood's enthusiasm and the discussion of whether the mechanism was\r\ntelepathic or spiritistic seem premature. Some of Mrs Thompson's other\r\nsittings have had discouraging results. If there is something about Mrs\r\nHeywood which precipitates good results in an otherwise unsuccessful\r\nmedium, she W'ould be doing psychical research a service if next time she\r\ntook with her an expert notetaker.\r\nMrs Heywood concludes that \"Normal leakage seems incredible, and\r\nit is hard to imagine how Mrs Thompson could have got the names she\r\ndid otherwise than by E.S.P.\" Unfortunately for me I have a more\r\nvivid imagination than Mrs Heywood in this respect. Throughout this\r\nreport there is not the slightest attempt to make clear the points which\r\nare needed before it is possible to judge whether leakage was possible.\r\nEven more regrettable\u2014and surprising for a researcher of her standing\r\nMrs Heywood does not appear even to recognise that these points are\r\nrelevant. \" Evidence \" of this sort almost makes one despair of psychical\r\nresearch. What is the use of collecting year after year, volumes of\r\nmaterial, criticising it, scrutinising it, even subjecting it to statistical analysis, writing reports, articles and books about it, and running a large\r\nsociety for the purpose of investigating it, if the material itself is to be\r\npresented in such a slip-shod way as to give it no more value than a newspaper report?\r\nIn her recent correspondence in the Journal, Mrs Heywood asked for a lov\/ering of the standards of evidence demanded for publication of cases by the Society, with the reservation that the Editor should insert a footnote\r\nexplaining that these cases should not be considered as evidence for the\r\n^34 .\r\n' Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1948\r\nparanormal. To the naive reader this must have seemed harmless enough.\r\nPerhaps now he will realise what are the real issues involved. If, while\r\nthe Society's publications still demand a\r\n\" high \" standard, \" cases \" like Mrs Heywood's experience with Mrs Thompson can be included without\r\ncomment from the Editor, what is to become of our reputation as a scientific body if even these miserable standards are to be lowered still further?\r\nI urge you, Sir, far from lowering the standards, to raise them far\r\nabove their present level, until they are as high as, or higher than, the\r\nstandards of an ordinary scientific journal. The prestige of the Society\r\nis at stake. Yours etc.,\r\nJ. D. Proctor\r\nSir,\u2014Thank you for Mr Proctor's letter. I have handed him my head on a platter by the idiotic insertion of the name, Rupert, which he quotes\r\nfrom my report of a sitting with Mrs Thompson. I deserve his castigation\r\nand am only grateful that he suggests it may have been a slip of the pen.\r\nThis, as it was not in my notes, I dare to hope it was. It may well raise doubts in his mind about other points. I realise that I over-condensed\r\nwhat was intended to be a negative report. I did not, for instance, think\r\nthat the words \" Mrs Thompson, did not know me \" could suggest that\r\nshe might have had the opportunity to do anticipatory sleuthwork or to have heard me call my husband by his pet name in the family circle. I can, fortunately, at least assure him that the sitting\u2014my first\u2014was booked\r\nanonymously at the L.S.A. Mrs Thompson did not know whether to expect a man or a woman. She had never met me or my husband.\r\nI went accompanied by a member of the S.P.R. Council as notetaker,\r\nbut we learned on arrival that the control was temperamental about unfamiliar notetakers. Having reacted to strangers that way myself in myslight experience as a sensitive, I think the assumption mistaken that such\r\nan attitude must be due to fraudulent intentions. I therefore decided\r\nsimply to make friendly contact at the sitting, and attempt another, with an agreed-upon notetaker, later on. I did not report these details as mymotive was neither enthusiasm, the desire to produce scientific evidence, nor to suggest the possibility of spiritistic mechanism. It was simply to show once more how a sitting, which might have appeared suggestive of\r\nidentity to the average sitter, though naturally not to anyone of MrProctor's standards, contained in fact no more than a build-up of a pseudopersonality. I found it interesting that this build-up was partly achieved\r\nby the exercise of apparent E.S.P. but whether the control got its information by deduction, sleuth work or E.S.P. was not the point I was trying to bring out. This was a warning, which I had hoped to dramatise by\r\nmaking known only at the end the fact that \" Rupert \" was a fake, since\r\nRupert was still flourishing in this world. So ill did I succeed that MrProctor apparently got the impression that I was offering naive evidence\r\nof the \" unproven \" faculty of E.S.P. This was not so. Forty years\r\nexperience of the faculty in myself, corroborated evidence of it in myfriends, the printed evidence which tallies with our experiences, and the\r\ndeductions drawn from it by scientifically eminent men, have convinced\r\nme, not only that it is a proven fact, but that anyone who denies it either\r\nMAY 1948 Correspondence 235\r\nhas his judgment impaired by emotional bias, or, as Professor Broad says, has not read the evidence. I therefore do not think it necessary to try\r\nand re-prove it every time I refer to it, for the benefit of people who\r\nappear to have come to rest on the science of fifty years ago and whose\r\nviews in any case are unhkely to be afi\"ected by further evidence. This,\r\nnaturally, does not lessen my desire for repeatable evidence, by means of\r\nwhich to study the nature of a faculty which is, particularly for those who\r\nhave never experienced it, maddeningly elusive.\r\nMr Proctor seeks to examine whether any individual point was\r\n\" indisputably paranormal \". (Is E.S.P. still paranormal? Are we sure we are asking the right questions.-' As Professor H. H. Price says : \"... We may have to . . . puzzle ourselves, not about extra sensory\r\nperception but rather about normal sense perception, treating it, not as normal but rather as a sub-normal and biologically explicable limitation\r\nimposed upon an inherent and aboriginal omniscience.\") But surely any\r\nindividual point might have been chance coincidence.? It is taken\r\ntogether, and E.S.P. being an accepted fact, that I find it less strain on my\r\nimagination to attribute them to E.S.P. than to sleuthwork about an unknown sitter, .several chance coincidences, or information I consider\r\nI did not give the medium. My slip fully entitles Mr Proctor to doubt my\r\nreliability. It does not affect the point that it is unreasonable always to assume an accepted faculty to be a less probable explanation than a series\r\nof remarkable coincidences.\r\nTwo points puzzle me. On what principle does Mr Proctor deduce\r\nthat my friends are more likely to be called Cicely, Grace or Natalie, than\r\nMary, Doris or Joan.? As it happens I have three friends called Mary,\r\none, Doris and one, Joan ; but none called Grace or Cicely. And why\r\ndoes he say in one sentence that some of Mrs Thompson's sittings have\r\nbeen discouraging and in the next that she is an unsuccessful medium.?\r\nTo demand 100 per cent, success in any line of life seems a little exacting.\r\nI would like to thank Mr Proctor for his valuable scrutiny, criticism and\r\nanalysis of my little report, from which I have learnt much. I hope he\r\nwill soon give us some reports of experimental work and of sittings\r\nconducted by himself, as they would, I feel, even if the results have all been negative, help to raise our standards of work.\r\nYours etc., Rosalind Heywood\r\nThe Pendulum Experiment \u2022\r\nSir,\u2014We welcome Mr Cuddon's repudiation of the intention to prove\r\nanything by the pendulum experiment reported in the October-November\r\nnumber of this Journal. We seem, however, not to have succeeded in making clear the exact point of our criticism. The implication that he\r\nhad proved that pendulums could not be moved by psychic force was\r\ncontained in the last paragraph but one of his Report, in which he finds it \" remarkable \" that even after he had explained how the trick was done\r\n\" there were still two people in the audience . . . who insisted that the\r\npendulums could be moved by the power of thought alone \". Not, be it noted, that Mr Cuddon had so moved them but that they could be. Why\r\n236 \u2022 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY 1948\r\nshould Mr Cuddon iind this remarkable unless he thought that his experiment and its explanation had disproved this possibility? He now disclaims this implication. Our modest effort to obtain clarification of his\r\nmeaning is justified by this recantation. It is worth taking some trouble\r\nto find out exactly what an experiment proves. We have no quarrel with\r\nMr Cuddon's position as stated in his letter ; obviously his sitters were\r\ntoo easily convinced of the paranormal origin of the movements.\r\nThere seems in the last paragraph of Mr Cuddon's letter to be some\r\nmisunderstanding of the typical experimental situation. In no properly\r\ndesigned experiment is it necessary to assume the good faith of the subject\r\nand, in fact, one does not do so. Where one has the right to assume good\r\nfaith is in the reports made by other experimenters ; that is necessary\r\nunless each of us is to draw conclusions only from his own work. One's\r\nmind must, of course, remain open to the possibility in a particular case of a conspiracy to deceive, and one makes the best judgment one can,\r\nbased cn the scientific standing of the experimenter, his previous record\r\nas to honesty and reliability, our own judgment as to the adequacy of his\r\nmethods, etc. In accepting the truthfulness of Mr Cuddon's original\r\nstatement that the pendulums were moved paranormally, the audience were only treating his statements as one normally can those of a reputable\r\nexperimenter. In their defence it must be remembered that they had very\r\nlittle to base tlieir opinions on except those statements ; the experiment\r\nitself was obviously not performed under critical conditions but the\r\naudience were not asked whether they thought the experiment they had\r\nseen proved that the pendulums had been m.oved paranormally.\r\nMrs Goldney's astonishment at our reference to Dr Winther's work\r\nseems misplaced. We suggested that the ' two people who remained\r\nunconvinced that the pendulums could not be moved by thought alone\r\nmay have been influenced by their knowledge of Dr Winther's experiments. Why not? They may not have shared Mrs Goldney's poor\r\nopinion of Dr Winther's experimental conditions. They may not even\r\nhave heard of the rumour to which Mrs Goklney refers. Or they may have\r\nheard of it and have had sufficient critical judgment to be unconvinced by\r\na condemnation of his work from anonymous \" responsible quarters \" on\r\ngrounds unspecified. Credulity has its limits and this may have sounded to them too much like the war-time evidence of \" my aunt's charwoman v\/ho\r\nknovv's someone who works in the office of someone high up who says . . . \". We also find ourselves unable to agree with the further argument of\r\nMrs Goldney that there is a mental discipline of psychical researchers\r\nwhich should have enabled the audience in the absence of evidence to have been certain that the pendulums were not moved by \" psychic\r\nforce \". This argument seems to depend on the obviously erroneous assumptions that if the demonstrable occurrence of psychic phenomena is rare then psychic phenomena must be rare, and that if two explanations\r\nare possible but of unequal probability then one can be certain that the more probable is the true one. Both assumptions seem opposed to common sense. Undoubtedly one cannot be certain of a paranormal\r\nexplanation unless all normal possibilities of explanation are excluded, but\r\nneither can one be certain of a normal explanation unless the possibility\r\nof a paranormal explanation can be excluded. '\r\nMAY 1948 Correspondence 237\r\nThe true mental discipline of the psychical researcher would keep his\r\nmind open where Mrs Goldney's rules would close it. Unjustified\r\ncertainty in denying the paranormal is no more the road to truth than\r\nunjustified certainty in affirming it. In other words, psychical researchers\r\nmust use their common sense and make the best judgments they can when evidence is incomplete, and must hold the opinions based on those\r\njudgments with no more and no less certainty that the evidence warrants.\r\nYours etc.,\r\n\u2022 R. H. Thouless\r\n. - B. P. WiESNER\r\nSir,\u2014I cannot understand why Drs Thouless and Wiesner should\r\nrepeatedly imply that my argument concerned \" certainty \" that the\r\npendulums were not moved by psychic force. For I specificallv wrote in my earlier letter (January issue) \" Mr Cuddon's experiment was not\r\ndesigned to prove anything in connection with the movement of\r\npendulums \", and \" Of course ' I don't know ' was the final answer to Mr Cuddon's question, but the audience had been asked to state what\r\nthey thought (italics in original) was the cause of the pendulums' move- ment \". Nowhere in my earlier letter do I use the word \" certainty \", or anywhere imply certainty ; yet Drs Thouless and Wiesner use this word\r\nand impute this as my meaning five times in a few lines. This repeated\r\ndistortion of what I said confuses the issue and does not help readers to assess the value of opposing viewpoints.\r\nI must maintain my argument that, demonstrable psi being as rare as\r\nit is, one should \" postulate a normal explanation in preference to psi''\r\nwhen invited to make a choice in an uncontrolled experiment\u2014let alone\r\nin the obviously music-hall setting purposely staged by Mr Cuddon for an informal occasion. If Drs Thouless and Wiesner do not agree with\r\nwhat I consider to be a disciplined and common-sense attitude, then we\r\nmust agree to differ. Further, in their criticism of Mr Cuddon, they continue to overlook\r\nthe point I made in my last letter ; that there was no question of real deception of the audience, since they were expressly given alternatives\r\nfrom which to select, one of which was that the movement of the\r\npendulums was caused by the table being pushed by Mr Cuddon and his\r\naccomplices.\r\nYours etc., K. M. GOLDNEY\r\nREVIEW\r\nThe Kingdom of the Lost. By J. A. H. Ogdon. (London : The\r\nBodley Head. 1947.)\r\nMr Howard Ogdon, a teacher by profession and a graduate of London\r\nUniversity, is plainly a man of wide reading and culture, with a gift for\r\nclear exposition and vivid description. His book is the true story of a\r\ncertifieci schizophrenic patient who escapes from a mental hospital and\r\nrecovers his sanity outside. The manifestations of the disease\u2014depres-\r\n238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may i 948\r\nsions, delusions, obsessions, etc.\u2014are recounted as personal experiences.\r\nIn this form they make far more fascinating reading than the dry catalogue\r\nof symptoms to be found in the average textbook.\r\nConditions in a typical County Mental Hospital, considered from the\r\npatient's point of view, are shown to be in need of reform. In this section\r\nof the book the carefully factual tone, and the writer's obvious understatement of his grievances, carry considerable conviction.\r\nMr Ogdon is a believer in the widespread influence of telepathy, and\r\nhis account includes several psychic episodes which might well have been\r\nadded to the illustrations in Dr Ehrenwald's Telepathy and Medical\r\nPsychology} For example, the writer describes how one Sunday evening\r\nwhile listening to some church bells, he had an almost irresistible impulse\r\nto throw himself out of an attic window. Later that same evening someone\r\ncalled and said that one of the bell-ringers had killed himself by jumping\r\noff a bridge. In another instance quoted by the writer there was a sudden\r\nepidemic of attempted escapes at the time he was secretly planning his own\r\nget-away, and he felt sure this must be due to his own telepathic influence on the other patients. Against this theory must be set the admitted fact that a feeling of being able to influence others from a distance was one of\r\nthe delusions of his disease.\r\nMr Ogdon claims to have noticed other strange powers in himself and\r\nother patients. There was the man who, without appearing to consult\r\na clock, had a fit of shouting every day at precisely the same time. As a\r\nresult of a lunatic impulse Mr Ogdon himself several times knocked off a patient's hat with a cricket ball, a feat which would have been impossible\r\nfor him in a normal state of health.\r\nWhen the time came for his great escape, Mr Ogdon gave up his plans\r\nfor a nocturnal break-away. Instead he merely strolled straight out of the\r\nplace without being challenged by anyone. He attributes the success of\r\nthis technique to Yoga exercises which he believes rendered him unnoticeable to observers. Sceptical readers may prefer to believe it was\r\nthe sheer brazenness of his behaviour which prevented anyone accosting\r\nhim, and may classify his alleged invisibility as one of those delusions\r\nwhich, he tells us, sometimes persist as isolated features after the mind as\r\na whole has recovered. D. J. West\r\nOBITUARY : MR HARRY PRICE\r\nTo the general public no one engaged in psychical research was. better\r\nknown than Mr Harry Price, whose death was recorded in the press on March 30th. Mr Price, who had since his boyhood kept up a keen interest\r\nin psychical matters, joined the Society in 1920, and shortly afterwards\r\nbecame prominent in the Society by his exposure of Mr William Hope,\r\nthe \" spirit \" photographer, reported in the Journal for May 1922. Conan\r\nDoyle took up the cudgels on behalf of Hope, and for a time the\r\ncontroversy over \" The Crew Circle \" tended to obscure more important\r\ndevelopments in psychical research.\r\nMr Price was by temperament essentially a free-lance, and acting as such he was able to pursue methods of investigation and publicity which\r\n^Reviewed in the Journal for March-April, 1948.\r\nMAY 1948 ~ Obituary 239\r\nwould have been incompatible with work conducted luidcr the auspices of an old-established Society. One need only mention the entertaining\r\nepisode of the Brocken related in Confessions of a Gliost-liiDiter. It would, however, be unfair to Mr Price to suggest that all his investigations were of this nature, lie had a very genuine interest in the physical\r\nphenomena of the seance room and in poltergeists, and his knowledge of\r\nconjuring and his skill in devising and working various systems of\r\nmechanical control made him formidable to the fraudulent medium. The\r\nresults of his investigations were presented to the public in a series of\r\narticles in the Bulletins of the National Laboratory for Psychical\r\nInvestigation (later the London LTniversity Council for Psychical\r\nInvestigation) and in various books, all of which were admirably produced\r\nand illustrated by photographs of a very high order. By these publications,\r\nby his lectures, and by his close contact with officials of the B.B.C., he\r\nsucceeded in interesting in the particular aspects of psychical research\r\nwith which he was most conversant a very large public to whom a more\r\nphilosophic approach to the central problems of our subject would have\r\nmade no appeal. His handling of the Borley Rectory affair is a good\r\nexample both of his qualities and his defects as a free-lance investigator.\r\nTo one side of the account must be set his enterprise in obtaining for a time exclusive control of the site, and his diligence both in enquiring into\r\nthe long and curious history of the haunt and in paying numerous visits to Borley during the later periods of its occurrence. On the other side\r\nmust be set his unwillingness to invite other experts in psychical research\r\nto participate in the investigation. It is possible that an approach to the\r\nproblem more in accordance with the methods of our Society might have\r\nproduced results not less interesting and far more conclusive.\r\nHe rendered an important service to psychical research in putting other\r\ninvestigators in touch with prominent mediums an3 sensitives, and by\r\ninviting them to seances he gave many of them their first practical experi- ence of that side of our subject.

There has long been a need for a periodical which will make available, in a non-technical manner but in a scientific spirit, the\r\nresults of the work of specialists in this department of research. It is to be hoped that many readers oi Enquiry may be led to take a deeper interest\r\nin psychical research and its implications and to carry their enquiries\r\nfurther by making use of the facilities and resources of the Society.\r\nThe April issue of Enquiry has a distinguished list of contributors,\r\nincluding G.

Correspondence and book reviews are therefore brought up to date in this number,\r\nand the next will be a ' public ' number in which no letters will be\r\nprinted. It is possible that a further public number may be issued\r\nbefore the end of the year.\r\nThe Editor would like to take this opportunity of asking correspondents\r\nto keep their letters as short as possible.\r\n242 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research june-july 1948\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nThe Reach of the Mind\r\nSome Comments on Dr Soal's Review\r\nSir,\u2014I am amazed that the review of The Reach of the Mind in the\r\nJournal for February 1948 could be written by one wh\u00a9 has made such a briUiant contribution to the experimental literature of E.S.P., and that\r\nit should appear in the Journal of the Society whose honourable history\r\nestablishes the claim of the British to a position of pre-eminence in the\r\nnew science of the human mind.\r\nI will not engage in a point-by-point discussion of this review. The\r\nbook can speak for itself and certainly not one of our members will wish\r\nto miss it. Nor will I argue the reviewer's interpretation of the early\r\nhistory of the Duke work, although I am familiar in some detail with that\r\nhistory and I disagree with his interpretation. I would like to attempt\r\nsomething more constructive than rebuttal. The reviewer asks several\r\nquestions, and these with profit might be answered.\r\nAt first glance it is curiously suggestive that there have been no high\r\nscoring subjects reported in recent years. Upon further thought it is entirely reasonable. The high score results obtained in the 1930's have\r\nnot been duplicated in the present decade for at least these reasons : the\r\nsearch for outstanding subjects has not been a primary objective and\r\nsuccess in simple card-calling experiments has not been even a secondary\r\nobjective among the senior workers in the U.S.A. since before the war. After the symposium on E.S.P. held by the American Psychological\r\nAssociation in 1938 at which there was no effective criticism of the welldone experiments, it became clear that mere card-calling could not\r\nconvince most psychologists of the reality of E.S.P. Card-calling experiments demonstrate an anomaly in nature, and few psychologists will accept an anomaly of such momentous implications. It was decided then\r\nthat future effort should be devoted to learning about psi and not to proving its existence.\r\nIn his 1942 presidential address Professor R. H. Thouless expressed\r\nthis point of view with admirable lucidity. ' If we meet with sceptics . . . let us . . . not succumb to the temptation of trying to satisfy them\r\nourselves. . . . The methods appropriate to a research intended to establish the reality of the phenomena are not generally appropriate to a research\r\nintended to elucidate the character and conditions of the phenomena. . . . Workers must be content with such moderate standards of significance\r\nas are used in other branches of scientific research, since the time available\r\nfor any course of experiments is limited.'\r\nThe second question which I have taken from this review of The Reach\r\nof the Mind is one which interests me as a physicist. Why can a falling\r\ndie be more easily influenced than a delicately balanced needle.? Granting\r\ntentatively the reviewer's premise, one can speculate as to the answer. In the light of our knowledge of physics it seems entirely proper that a tumbling die should be more sensitive than a balanced needle. The die\r\nJUNE-JULY 1948 Correspondence 243\r\nmay be presumed to pass through a number of metastable situations\r\nwherein the energy required to choose between ahernative paths in the\r\ncausative chain is very tiny. Physical energy comes in packets of minute\r\nbut finite size. One quantum of electromagnetic energy, properly timed\r\nand aimed, could thus conceivably govern the final position of a die ; whereas even a million quanta would be utterly insignificant when applied\r\nto a needle. The difference between these situations can be made clear\r\nby analogy. The hand of one man on the throttle of a train can control it easily. The same man pushing or pulling from behind would never be\r\nnoticed.\r\n^ The reviewer's third question is of a different nature. He says is it really credible ' that one-out-of-three of the inmates of a school for the\r\nblind should score significantly above chance. This question is important,\r\nnot for its own sake, but for the thought which lies behind it. In modern\r\nphysics we no longer say ' Is it credible.? ' Since Einstein's special theory\r\nof relativity we have come to realise that our intuition is of no value in\r\nassessing reality. The only question which can rightly be asked is ' Has\r\nIt been observed.? ' The reviewer accepts telepathy but not PK. This acceptance of one phenomenon and rejection of another on what appears to be no better\r\nbasis than personal preference is mystifying to me. I do not understand\r\nthe type of mmd which is bold enough to defy orthodox science by\r\naccepting telepathy and yet is so timid as to deny psychokinesis when\r\nthe evidence for the latter is rather better than for the former.\r\nI think the explanation for much of what has been written in this review is to be found in the reviewer's own words :\r\n' It is of course extremely difficult for an Englishman who has had no personal contact\r\nwith any of the experimenters or witnessed any of the experiments to torm a sound estimate of the true value of the vast volume of research\r\nthat has been turned out by Duke University and other U.S.A. institutions\r\nduring the past fifteen years.'\r\nI would like to endorse the suggestion made recently by Professor C. D Broad that some way be found to bring about an exchange of personnel between England and the United States. In this way experimenters will come to appreciate the importance of the psychological milieu in psi research. 1 would hope, too, that among the experimenters coming to\r\nthis country there would be a few young graduate students of psychology\r\n1 heir training m psychology would permit them to understand the subtle\r\nnature ot the human mind, and their youth might allow them to appreciate the importance of the working conditions at Duke-for above alL in my visits to Durham I have been impressed by the youthful atmosphere of Dr Rhine s laboratory. ^\r\nYours etc., Robert A. McConnell\r\nDepartment of Physics,\r\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\r\n244 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research june-july 1948\r\nResult of the Prize Offer to Physical Mediums\r\nSir,\u2014In the issue of the Journal for May I find a number of remarkable\r\nletters and, if I may be permitted to do so, I should like to offer a few\r\nobservations. Dr Bendit starts off by saying that there are in fact very\r\nfew, if any, mediums in this country who can produce genuine physical\r\nphenomena. How can he know this? How many has he investigated?\r\nIndeed, has he seriously investigated any of them? He then goes on to attack the conditions under which the prize offered was made and the\r\nreport of the result in the January Journal. He thinks that the mediums\r\nwho refused to be investigated may have shown more understanding of\r\npsychic matters than the investigator. They may, he says, be using\r\ncommon sense in refusing in some cases to be ' lured into a completely\r\nfalse position '. But, Sir, since, according to Dr Bendit there are few if any genuine physical mediums at all in this country, is it not just possible\r\nthat this may be the reason for the refusals, and not all the fancy reasons\r\nthat Dr Bendit has produced?\r\nIt is to be regretted that Dr Bendit does not agree with the Society's\r\nintention to study hypnotism. It is, however, one of the phenomena\r\nthat the Society examined very early and I suggest he looks up page 3 of\r\nVol. I of our Proceedings.\r\nMrs Richmond's knowledge is even more surprising than that of Dr\r\nBendit. He knows that nearly all physical mediums are frauds. She\r\nknows what is going on in Dr West's ' unconscious '. ' Nothing happens ' when certain ' Research Officers ' are present. Really! Dr West and I must have been badly hallucinated. I have seen nearly all the so-called\r\nphysical phenomena : Dr West has naturally seen less. But as it appears\r\nthat through our unconscious processes there are no ' results I can only\r\nsuppose that Mrs Richmond means genuine psychic phenomena. In\r\nother words she agrees with Dr Bendit that the mediums are frauds and\r\nthat all the phenomena we have seen are spurious. Or is it about to be\r\nsuggested that Dr West's unconscious is so active that genuine mediums\r\nare transformed into arrant frauds the moment he enters the seance room ; or that my ' telepathic ' influence when not even in the room is able to send them running to the theatrical houses to buy the false beards, a specimen of which Brigadier Firebrace picked up the other day shortly\r\nafter I had admired the full forms that wheezed and squeaked in front of\r\nme time and again?\r\nIt is not, I think, that members are getting ' fed up ' (to use Mrs Richmond's phrase) with our admirable and open-minded Research Officer. It\r\nis rather with those who seem to be out of touch with the Society's aims\r\nand methods but who remain within it and, as it seems to me, hinder,\r\nobstruct, and even sabotage its work, discredit its offiicials and make it ridiculous in the eyes of other scientific men who are not acquainted with\r\nthe internal controversies which must always be present in work such as ours. In conclusion I must say that the letter of Drs Thouless and Wiesner\r\nis as mysterious to me as it is to Mrs Goldney. They say that Mrs\r\nGoldney's rules would close the mind of the psychical researcher whereas\r\na\r\n' true mental discipline ' would keep it open. And then a few lines\r\nJUNE-JULY 1948 Correspondence 245\r\nlower down (p. 237) they say that common sense must be used. If I understand her rightly that is just what Mrs Goldney has been saying.\r\nIf we four go to a show and see chosen cards rise at command from a\r\nglass tumbler of course we cannot be certain in one sense that paranormal\r\nforces are not at work. When I drive in a car with Marion of course I cannot be certain that, as in the case of Mrs Silbert, it is not psychic\r\npower propelling the vehicle but merely spirit from the pump. Are we\r\nreally to assume (as the letter suggests) that, whenever Drs Thouless and\r\nWiesner see an effect they cannot explain, their open minds will compel\r\nthem to suspend judgment and thus open the way to an ' investigation ' of the ' phenomenon ' } I was recently assured that this was in ^ct the\r\nproper attitude by a gentleman I met in the Society's Rooms. I wish\r\nI could dwell in the kind of world in which some of our members seem to pass their time. It must be like living in fairyland.\r\nYours etc., E. J. Dingwall\r\nSir,\u2014I feel, with Dr West's reply to my last letter to you, that we are getting somewhere in tracing out the reasons for the monotonous and\r\nMolotovian negativeness in the reports of investigations of various\r\nmediums and phenomena. Mrs Richmond's letter says a lot more than\r\nI was myself prepared to say at the time. Her contention is, moreover,\r\nborne out by Dr West's letter, which shows in one or two particular\r\ninstances a desire rather to score a rhetorical point\u2014i.e. an emotional\r\none\u2014than to be strictly impartial and scientific. Of this he is no doubt\r\nunconscious, but in the interests of our research work, I must ask him to answer them.\r\nFirst : in my letter I mentioned Dr William Brown's views on hypnosis\r\nas those with which I myself agreed. Dr West makes it appear that I therefore think Dr William Brown a suitable person for psychical research.\r\nWill he please explain the connection? It may be my unconscious\r\nresistance to seeing it, but it seems decidedly far-fetched.\r\nSecond: Dr West speaks of ' the numerous physical mediums who\r\ngive seances in London and in spiritualist circles ', and asks whether I think them frauds because I said that very few mediums were able to produce physical phenomena. Am I to take it that Dr West knows of, or believes, that there are these ' many physical mediums ' producing\r\nphenomena? If so, I shall value his assistance in showing them to me,\r\nand I will gladly take my statement back if I am satisfied with what\r\nI see. But if they do indeed exist, then I am entitled to ask him, as the\r\nSociety's Research Officer (a) whether he has actually seen such\r\nphenomena? {b) if so, why he has not told of them and varied the tone of\r\nhis reports with them? or (c) if he thinks them worth investigating, why\r\nhe has not done so? I think the answer is that, in actual fact he agrees\r\nwith my view, but could not resist the temptation to turn my negative\r\nstatement into a positive accusation of fraud.\r\nThere are a number of other points on which I definitely join issue\r\nwith Dr West. He says, for example, that one would have to look a long\r\nway before obtaining confirmation of my views on hypnosis. But it is not going very far afield to look up Dr William Brown's Psychological\r\n246 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research june-july 1948\r\nMethods of Healing. And if Dr West were better acquainted with some\r\nof the really experienced members of the psychiatric fraternity, he would\r\nfind that there are others besides myself who, directly or indirectly, share\r\nmy view. This is, that hypnosis is bad for the subject undergoing it, even where this bad effect is designed to lead to a good result. Yes,\r\nthere is a vast literature on hypnosis. It would be worth Dr West's\r\ntrouble to study the subject carefully before embarking on his experiments. He will find there that, in general terms, the best subjects for\r\nhypnosis are actual or potential hysterics. And it is the merest commonsense to suggest that the very people who are hypnotisable are the ones who should most decidedly not be hypnotised.\r\nIncidentally, the fact that others do hypnotic experiments does not\r\njustify the method. The fact that they have bullfights in Spain does not\r\nmake them any more humane. The fact that many people drink alcohol\r\ndoes not eliminate the fact that the misuse of alcohol results in poisoning.\r\nAnd if one seeks to justify oneself by pointing out that others too do a wrong thing, one must logically allow that the methods used in Malthausen, Belsen and Dachau are scientifically ethical because they have\r\nbeen used in the name of science.\r\nMoreover, if Dr West knew the literature of psychiatry better, he would\r\nnot tell us of the wonders which hypnosis has taught us. The fact of\r\nthe matter is that though in early days we learned a certain amount, for\r\nthe last twenty years or more hypnosis has taught psychiatry virtually\r\nnothing at all. It is surely time to drop a method of experiment which\r\nhas lost its value and is archaic, quite apart from any bad effects on its victims.\r\nThen on the matter of the laboratory. It is all very well for Dr West\r\nairily to dismiss the subtle factors which in my opinion inhibit the\r\nproduction of phenomena. But, with the experience of twenty years as a psychotherapist, and more as a human being, I suggest that in any\r\nhuman contact these subtle factors operate. All the more so do they\r\nbecome important when dealing with psi and its manifestations. And it\r\nis not the conscious which counts. The unconscious is perhaps more\r\nimportant than external comfort, or the charm of the operator. Dr\r\nRhine realises this ; hence, perhaps, his positive results where others have\r\nfailed. That is why I suggest that psychical researchers require a high\r\ndegree of self-awareness to succeed. That this may be attained by some\r\nform of analysis is well known. There are, of course, failures in analysis : we always have to cope with those who are either incapable or unwilling\r\nto learn to see themselves as they are (a thing far more devastating even,\r\nin its early stages, than seeing ourselves as others see us).\r\nIt amounts to this : the personal factor is of even greater importance\r\nin psychical research than in most other fields. A worker may be\r\nconsciously anxious to obtain results, but his unconscious mind may put\r\ninsuperable obstacles in the way, either from direct resistance to the\r\nsubject under consideration or simply because it is disgruntled and\r\ninharmonious in a more general way. It is essential that the detachment\r\nof the scientific attitude should be something more than a superficial\r\nmanifestation, but should apply to those parts below the surface as much\r\nas to those above. And I suggest that the constant failure to obtain\r\nJUNE-JULY 1948 Correspondence 247\r\nresults should be blamed far more on the operator's mentality than on\r\nhis subject's capabilities.\r\nYours etc.,L. J. Bendit, M.D., D.P.M.\r\nThe Art of Psychical Research\r\nSir,\u2014Recent issues of the Journal, and the meeting addressed by Dr\r\nBendit, have drawn attention to a division of opinion on the subject of\r\nlaboratory tests. One school of thought dismisses these as ' silly '\r\n; the\r\nother inclines to question the genuineness of any phenomena, or of any\r\nsensitive, that cannot be tested with positive results in a laboratory.\r\nIt seems to me that the antithesis is a mistake, and that both kinds of\r\nwork are necessary and complementary. There appears to be a confusion\r\nbetween the phenomenon in its natural context and the phenomenon in\r\nisolation\u2014if it can be isolated. Is there not an art of Psychic Research,\r\nas well as a science? A word in a poem gets its magical effect from its context. You may isolate the word, you can study it with dictionaries\r\nand subject it to every philological test, and you will learn valuable things\r\nabout it. The one thing you will not learn is why it produces a magical\r\neffect in the poem from which you have taken it. The magical eloquence\r\nof a dancer's hand in a ballet cannot be tested and accounted for by\r\ncutting off the hand and anatomising it in the laboratory.\r\nA number of scientists, among them Whitehead, Jeans, and Sullivan,\r\nhave been at pains to tell us that science is limited to describing the\r\nstructure of things, and that it cannot measure\u2014for instance\u2014the quality\r\nof a work of art. In other words, there are phenomena that can be studied\r\nonly in their context. They are essential parts of a whole, and their\r\nvalidity can never be tested in isolation from the whole of which they are a part.\r\nI suggest therefore that, leaving aside considerations of courtesy and\r\nexpediency, there is a factual basis for urging each side in the controversy\r\nto respect the aims and practices of the other. We have room for the\r\nartist as well as the scientist. In fact, we cannot get along without\r\nboth.\r\nYours etc., L. A. G. Strong\r\nConditions for Investigation of Mediums\r\nSir,\u2014Despite the statement made by some of our members in the\r\nMarch issue of the Journal of Parapsychology that so far in this country\r\nonly two persons have been found who can acquire knowledge of facts other than by normal means, I assert that on the contrary dozens of\r\nmediums are displaying their powers day in and day out throughout the\r\nyear. I have many times had clear proof of this. At the Annual General Meeting I suggested that the Society should\r\ncontinue the enquiry into platform mediumship which was interrupted\r\nby the war. I wish to express my conviction of the importance of\r\n248 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research JUNE-JULY 1948\r\nconducting such investigations in an atmosphere suited to the temperament of the subject, and I hope the Council will study carefully Professor\r\nRhine's article on ' Conditions Favouring Success in Psi Tests ', and\r\nespecially the following paragraph :\r\n' When an especially gifted subject is involved or one whose claims\r\nare to be investigated, it is obviously necessary to begin with conditions\r\nthat he believes will alow the capacity in question to be manifested.\r\nIf need be, we can as a beginning let the subject himself lay down the\r\nconditions entirely. Then with successful demonstrations we can\r\nintroduce one precaution after another always in cooperation with the\r\nsubject until we arrive at adequate conditions. It is like the task of\r\nthe naturalist studying a wild animal : we must first do what is necessary to keep in sight of the animal. As everyone who studies\r\nparapsychology well knows, there has been a great deal too much\r\ndogmatic laying-down of conditions in advance, on one assumption or another, with resultant waste of time and retardation of\r\nprogress.'\r\nIn other words first study the medium in his own environment and\r\npatiently acquire his confidence. Then and then only try to secure his\r\npresence, at first under his own conditions, in your seance room. Yours etc., B. Abdy Collins\r\nThe Subject's Viewpoint\r\nSir,\u2014^The two reports on divining published in the May issue of the\r\nJournal suffer from incompleteness in the absence of any comment by\r\nthe diviners concerned in the experiments.\r\nIn the case of all such reports, whether relating to divining, E.S.P.\r\nor other matters, their value would be added to by publishing the views\r\nof the functioning mediums, or by a note stating that they had failed to respond to an invitation to furnish a comment.\r\nThe same remark applies to published correspondence expressing\r\nconflicting opinions on recorded experiences (e.g. the letters of Drs Bendit\r\nand West, and of Mr Proctor and Mrs Heywood, also in the May number).\r\nIn fact, we hear far too little at first-hand of the view-point of mediums\r\nin concrete cases in which they are intimately concerned.\r\nYours etc., H. DE Laessoe\r\nA Significant Book Test\r\nSir,\u2014In the May issue of the Journal Mr Allen J. Sharp examines Mr\r\nDrayton Thomas's paper on ' A Significant Book Test '. The merits or demerits of Mr Thomas's paper will not be discussed in this letter. But\r\nthe standards of criticism adopted by Mr Sharp deserve examination.\r\nThe Byron book contained marginal notes. Mr Sharp writes, ' It would be safe to say that in nine cases out of ten, such a book would also\r\nJUNE-JULY 1948 Correspondence 249\r\nhave been used as a depository for letters and clippings.' Either (a) Mr\r\nSharp is offering as a fact what is no more than a personal impression, or\r\n{b) having adopted the highest standards of psychical research, he means\r\nthat if a book contains marginal notes the probability that it also contains\r\nletters and clippings is 0-90. In this case he possesses data to support his\r\ncontention. Where are the data ? A little farther on he states, ' Since the most popular size of paper is quarto...' Mr Sharp is tantalising. How^ does he know this? If he has\r\nstatistical information on the subject may we have it? Again\u2014' Most books published about this period, and especially collections of poems, have coloured flyleaves.' Which period? The date of\r\npublication of Mr Thomas's Byron is not disclosed in the report. And will Mr Sharp provide information on the relative frequency of coloured flyleaves?\r\nOn the statement by Feda (or Uncle Alfred) that ' Byrons are not usually\r\nillustrated ', Mr Sharp observes that ' Most collections of poems at least bear a frontispiece '. Do they?\r\nFinally, he tried an experiment. He ' selected at random a rather antiquated manual of geology which (he) recollected as having marginal notes '. This is evidently a contradiction in terms. Random selection implies a process of randomisation, and Mr Sharp's failure to use such a process\r\nindicates that his method was biased.\r\nIt is open to question whether, in applying a quantitative analysis to the\r\nevidence, Mr Sharp chose the method of criticism best suited to the case. However that may be, when criticism is made on a quantitative basis, it must, if it is to be of any significance, conform to the rigorous standards\r\ninherent in this particular method.\r\nYours etc.,\r\nJ. Fraser Nicol\r\nThe Psi Processes\r\nSir,\u2014May I be permitted to offer some criticisms of the paper by Drs\r\nThouless and Wiesner in Vol. XLVIII of the Proceedings dated\r\nDecember 1947?\r\nThe case that these psychologists make is avowedly based upon the\r\nhypothesis of the separateness of mind and brain. I submit that the\r\nknown facts of physiology make such a hypothesis untenable : The more highly developed the brain, the fuller the degree of consciousness. A sufferer from G.P.I, loses his intelligence progressively. It is possible to destroy a\r\n' mind ' neurone by neurone. Memories can be\r\nextirpated from the ' mind ', by extirpating a brain centre. The intelli- gence is seated in the association fibres of the frontal cortex, as the famous\r\n' American Crowbar Case ' proves conclusively. (The ' shin ' is largely\r\nidentical with the frontal cortex, as it receives impulses relating to perceptions and sends down muscular impulses.) All these facts, taken\r\ntogether, indicate fairly conclusively that mind and brain are identical\r\n(except, of course, in a purely metaphysical sense\u2014that is, we can look\r\n250 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research june-july 1948 on a mental process from the physiological or from the psychological\r\npoint of view). They are incomparable with any theory of separateness.\r\nThere is one argument that is very cogent indeed. Softening of the\r\noccipital lobe may cause alexia, or word-blindness. The patient can see written words, but he cannot understand them. If the mind were\r\nseparate from the brain, the patient would be able to understand the\r\nwords also, for, by hypothesis, the mind is able to perceive them.\r\nI am not for a moment disputing that there is a deeper part of the\r\npersonality, that which is involved in the mystical experience which really\r\nis independent of the brain ; but Drs Thouless and Wiesner are obviously\r\ndiscussing the mind as we know it. A word or two upon the entelechy : Neither the word itself, nor the\r\ntheory, originated with Driesch. Beginning with Aristotle, under the\r\nname of ivreXexeia, it has passed through the hands of Albertus Magnus,\r\nAquinas, Leibnitz and Hegel, Plotinus and Proctus. There may quite\r\nwell be some truth in it, but not in the form in which Driesch understood\r\nit. To Driesch, the entelechy meant the subliminal mind, performing\r\nthe processes of embryology by means of telepathy and materialisation.\r\nDriesch, himself an embryologist, said this almost in these very words,\r\nwhen he was president of the S.P.R., and he offered the theory as a contribution to embryology. To-day, after twenty or more years of\r\nembryological research, his views are totally discredited. No embryologist\r\nbelieves them, or could possibly believe them. The publication of Joseph\r\nNeedham's book. Biochemistry and Morphogenesis, has killed them for\r\never. The growth of the embryo is plainly shown as the work of hormones.\r\nI hope the authors of the paper will not object to my strictures, which\r\nare offered purely in the interests of truth.\r\nYours etc., Basil Smith\r\nREVIEWS\r\nHeyday of a Wizard : Daniel Home, the Medium. By Jean Burton.\r\nForeword by Harry Price. (London : Harrap. 1948. 244 pp.\r\nIllus. los. 6d.)\r\n' To point a moral, go to extremes ' says the well-known maxim.\r\nStudents of the physical phenomena of psychical research should study\r\nthe extreme case of D. D. Home's mediumship, and in so doing will find\r\nthis biography of great assistance and a ready reference to the various\r\nphases of Home's career. The literature on Home is profuse, including two autobiographical\r\nbooks written by himself, two biographies written after his death by his\r\nsecond wife, papers and articles in the S.P.R. Proceedings and Journal,\r\nand a mass of references to his mediumship in Memoirs and Reminiscences\r\nof the time.\r\nJean Burton has drawn copiously from this literature, and tells her tale so capably and entertainingly that not only should her book find a place on the shelves of all students of psychical research, but it can be read by\r\nthe general reader as an absorbing tale depicting London and Continental\r\nsociety and the Royal Courts of Europe in their relation to the cult of\r\nJUNE-JULY 1948 Reviews\r\nSpiritualism during the latter half of the nineteenth century. For D. D.\r\nHome took two continents\u2014America and Europe\u2014by storm. He claimed\r\nnot only as his clientele but as his personal friends the elite and celebrities\r\nof many lands, and gave literally scores of sittings a year. ' By the end\r\nof the '6o's there was scarcely a man or woman of note who had not\r\nviewed the marvels of his seances or could not consult a friend who had,\r\n\r\nsays Miss Burton of the London scene. Yet he never suffered a serious, first-hand exposure, in spite of the two\r\nfeatures which make his mediumship unique : he invariably sat as one\r\nof the circle of sitters in full view of all, and his sittings were not held in\r\ndarkness but in varying degrees of light.-'^ Very different in quantity and quality of mediumship was the scene\r\nthen, compared to our own lean years. And very different the standards of\r\ninvestigation! The proven unreliability of the average, untrained witness\r\nwould allow us to dismiss the greater part of the copious testimony to the enormous range of Home's mediumship, were it not for the examination\r\nof Home by the eminent scientist Mr (later Sir) William Crookes, already\r\nat the time a Fellow of the Royal Society. Crookes's 'Researches into\r\nSpiritualism ' tells of his detailed investigations and complete belief in\r\nHome's genuineness as a result\u2014a belief shared by other savants such as Lord Crawford (the Master of Lindsay), Cromwell Varley, F.R.S., and\r\nothers. ' Deception,' wrote Varley to Prof Tyndall after investigation\r\nof Home carried out in his (Varley's) own home, ' was impossible.' An\r\neminent chemist, writing in the Birmingham Morning News at that time, sums up the situation as follows : ' Either a new and most extraordinary\r\nnatural force has been discovered, or some very eminent men, specially\r\ntrained in rigid physical investigation, have been the victims of a most\r\nmarvellous, unprecedented and inexplicable physical delusion. I say\r\nunprecedented because, although we have records of many popular\r\ndelusions of similar kind and equal magnitude, and speculative delusions\r\namong the learned, I can cite no instance of skilful experimental experts\r\nbeing utterly, egregiously and repeatedly deceived by the mechanical\r\naction of experimental test apparatus carefully constructed and used by\r\nthemselves.'\r\nFor all that, psychical researchers of to-day do not accept Home's\r\nphenomena as ' proven ' ; and the reasons for this abiding scepticism\r\nwould entail an exhaustive survey of surely one of the most absorbing\r\nstudies upon earth. A very few unimportant misprints in the American edition (New York,\r\nKnopf, 1944) have been corrected in the English version. A serious\r\nerror, however, has been overlooked (p. 225 of the English version),\r\nwhere, after Home's marriage in October 1871 to the aristocratic Mile\r\nJulie de Gloumeline (the Czar of Russia sending a sapphire and diamond\r\nring with his felicitations as a present), their daughter is described as being born 6 months later in April 1872, instead of in the autumn of\r\nthat year.

By S. W.\r\nTromp. (Leiden : A. W. SijthofF's Uitgeversmaatschappij N. V.\r\n1947. xxiv, 480 pp.)\r\nThe view most generally expressed in this country at the present time\r\nconcerning the relation between the phenomena of psychical research and\r\nscience is that the present scientific framework cannot include these\r\nphenomena. Professor Tromp has made an interesting contribution to the opposite viewpoint. The essence of his so-called neo-materialist view\r\nis the conclusion that both organic life and the inorganic non-living\r\nworld are governed by the same general laws, and in support of this thesis a general account of the behaviour of matter and of the development of\r\nlife to the atomic period is given. Attention is directed to the similarities\r\nin the behaviour of living matter and inorganic crystals, Tromp holding\r\nthat all the fundamental processes in living matter can be paralleled by\r\ncrystallisation phenomena. A very considerable quantity of factual\r\nmatter is incorporated in developing these views, and the general reader\r\nmay find difficulty in following much of the discussion, which frequently\r\ngoes into some detail and introduces difficult concepts with very little explanation.\r\nPsychical researchers may be interested in Professor Tromp's tentative\r\nexplanations of the most important parapsychological phenomena.\r\nTelepathy is ascribed to the propagation of electromagnetic waves from\r\none brain to another, the well-known electrical properties of the brain\r\nbeing mentioned in support of this hypothesis, and the experiments of\r\nKoopman and Franke on the encephalograms of persons in trance, which\r\nshowed an enormous increase of amplitude and a considerable change in\r\nthe Fourier analysis of the curves. True psychometry is considered to be\r\ndue to complex induced electromagnetic fields in the object used, although\r\ntelepathy may be the chief source of information in most psychometric\r\nseances. Prophecy of the future from the neo-materialistic viewpoint of\r\ntotal causality becomes comparable with psychometry of the past, but\r\nthe development of this reasoning leads to dubious ground in discussions\r\nof the scientific value of palmistry and astrology. A lengthy section is devoted to Tromp's original work on the movements of the divining rod,\r\nwhich he considers to be due to complex electromagnetic phenomena, the\r\nrod being able to detect magnetic field gradients as low as o-ooi\r\noersted\/cm. His conclusions are, however, often at variance in detail\r\nwith those of other investigators of divining, and it is clear that much\r\nfurther work is required in this field. The divining rod combined with\r\nthe human body is stated to be an instrument exceeding in sensitiveness\r\nall physical instruments.\r\nThe suggestion is made that the physiological processes of a medium\r\nin trance differ from those in normal persons, and enable an organic\r\nsubstance to be secreted through the pores which together with the\r\nelectromagnetic fields surrounding the body may account for telekinetic\r\nphenomena, but this is advanced only cautiously in view of the prevalence\r\nof charlatanry in these matters. The phenomena of phantoms and\r\nhauntings are considered to be largely imaginative, arising through a lack\r\nof critical observational capacity on the part of the observers, which may\r\nbe stimulated by such normal effects as the formation of spontaneously\r\nJUNE-JULY 1948 Reviews 253\r\ninflammable phosphine from interaction of disintegrating bones and\r\ntraces of acid in the soil, the self-ignition of methane containing phosphine,\r\nluciferous bacteria and natural electrical discharges. These various\r\nsuggestions are in line with the earlier views of Podmore, but Tromp also\r\nconsiders that telepathy and permanent induced electromagnetic fields must be postulated in the case of some local phantom phenomena.\r\nIn the descriptive portions a good deal of controversial work is described,\r\nsuch as that of Pfeiifer on crystallisation, Gurwitsch on mitogenetic rays, and (Mrs) Kolisko on lunar eiTects and dilution effects, without its being\r\nmade clear that such work has not been generally accepted by scientists,\r\nand in some cases is definitely regarded as erroneous. In view of the\r\ngreat quantity of factual information given, it seems a pity that the\r\ndubious work described is not more clearly characterised as such.\r\nA. J. B. Robertson\r\nOxford Essays on Psychology. By William Brown, D. M. (Oxon),\r\nD.Sc. (Lond.), F.R.C.P. (London : Wm. Heinemann Medical\r\nBooks Ltd. 1948. viii, 148 pp. ids. 6d.)\r\nThese seven essays were given by Dr Brown as lectures to his students\r\nat Oxford. Written as they are with a happy gift for summarising complex\r\nmaterial, and touching on many and varied subjects, these lectures should\r\nbe welcome, both to the reader who is beginning to be interested in\r\npsychological thought, and to the specialist who will value judgments\r\nand conclusions based on over thirty years of practical experience in the\r\nworld of psychology and psychiatry.\r\nThe subject matter is wide, ranging from ' General Psychological\r\nPrinciples ' to ' Social Psychology ', and the more specialised field of\r\n' The Psychology of Medicine '. The first lecture, ' General Psychological Principles can naturally deal\r\nonly briefly with so wide a subject, but holds much of interest, and shows\r\nDr Brown's always sympathetic insight.\r\nThe lecture which deals with social psychology, especially that on ' The\r\nGregarious Instinct and the Group Mind ' (with special reference to Nazi Germany and the paranoid character of its leaders), has an added\r\ninterest as being an early application of the insight given by psychoanalysis into political and racial events. The essay is written with a moderation which reflects Dr Brown's attitude throughout, and gives\r\na convincing picture of a nation suffering from the regressions and\r\nperversions familiar in individual psychological troubles.\r\nOne wishes that when writing on group psychology Dr Brown might\r\nhave speculated on the possibility (a possibility opened up by research\r\ninto telepathic phenomena) that where gregarious emotions are taking\r\nplace, there might be telepathy between members of the group. But Dr\r\nBrown does not seem to be much tempted by the type of speculation\r\nwhich has no scientific recommendation. No reference is made to the\r\nphenomena investigated by psychic research in this collection of essays,\r\nbut in the essay on ' General Psychological Principles ' Dr Brown\r\nwrites :\r\n' But we do not know of mind apart from body. Whether it is only\r\n254 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research june-july 1948\r\nin this life that mind is indissolubly wedded to body is an open\r\nquestion. The individual mind may survive bodily death (I myself\r\nthink this probable on moral grounds), but there is not enough scientific evidence to prove it. We may theorise, but from the point of view of\r\nstrict science we cannot build upon such theorising. What we can\r\nbuild upon is what v\/e know, and we know life when we see it, and life, as I have said, is fundamentally good. It implies an organism which\r\nhas established itself and is able to maintain itself in face of difficulties in relation to its environment, and even to turn those difficulties to its own use.'\r\nThis considered optimism is characteristic of Dr Brown's thought.\r\nIn the essay on ' Psychology and Medicine ' Dr Brown gives a summary\r\nof the days of Mesmer, Braid, Bernheim and Charcot, and discusses\r\ntheories and methods in the treatment by suggestion and hypnosis. Dr\r\nBrown was himself early in the more modern field of psychological\r\nmedicine and analysis, and relates some of his own experiences and\r\nconclusions in the treatment of 5000 shell-shocked soldiers who passed\r\nthrough his hands in the First World War.\r\nAs treatment, he came to the conclusion, in agreement now with the\r\ngeneral concensus of medical opinion, that hypnotism is only justified,\r\nand at its most useful, in cases of loss of memory ; and that in by far the greater number of such cases the suggestion of sleep and relaxation\r\nshould be substituted.\r\nStudents of psychical research who are working on experimental lines will be interested to hear Dr Brown's experiences and conclusions with\r\nregard to relaxation. It will probably be in the lecture on ' Recuperative\r\nRelaxation ' that they will find matter with most relevance to their\r\npursuit. In this lecture Dr Brown touches on the subject of Yoga, and\r\ngives a necessarily brief summary. He refers to a book which seems to be the first scientific evaluation of Yoga [Yoga, a Scientific Evaluation,\r\nby K. T. Behanan). This author spent two years in India in active\r\npractice of Yoga, and later carried out some careful physiological research\r\nwhen he returned to the U.S.A. on the effects of the oxygenation of the\r\nblood due to deep breathing and posture.\r\nIf relaxation of the active mind and body is, as some may conclude, a necessary condition for the functioning of the unconscious mind (i.e. in\r\nthe paranormal aspect of it now called E.S.P.) every technique for\r\nachieving relaxation must be worth investigation. In the psychiatric\r\nworld, where the aim is mental healing, attention and research is directed\r\nnow to the physical means of promoting mental change. So, in the even newer field of planned E.S.P. experiments, it seems that the attention of\r\nresearch may be turning to the exploration of physical conditions.\r\nIf the reader may be disappointed that Dr Brown has no essay on\r\npsychical research, he should get over his disappointment and allow\r\nhimself to be beguiled into ranging over these other but neighbouring\r\nfields with such an interesting and experienced guide.\r\nJUNE-JULY 1948 Reviews 255\r\nDas Ich, der Traum, der Tod. By Professor Dr Max Dessoir. (Stuttgart : Ferd. Enke. 1947. 185 pp.)\r\nThis short book is the last work of our late Corresponding Member,\r\nthe distinguished philosopher Max Dessoir, whose death was recorded\r\nin the Journal for September 1947. Writing when over eighty years old, after an interest in psychical research extending for more than sixty\r\nyears, he regretfully expresses the view that little progress has been made\r\ntowards establishing proof of survival, and that such evidence as has\r\ntranspired is for the present inconclusive. As his own life draws towards\r\nits end, he feels an obligation to place on record this result of his studies,\r\nand the more so since he believes that\u2014as in 19 17, when he published his\r\nfirst book\u2014the effect of the recent, as of the earlier, world war, is likely to be an increase in superstitious beliefs and a widespread indifference to objective judgment on these questions.\r\nThis is a readable little book ; although to the present reviewer at least\r\nit belies its title. The Ego, Dreams, and Death suggest a discussion of\r\nessentially psychological or psycho-analytical concepts and topics, which\r\nnowhere appear in the book (apart from one mention in reference to multiple personality). The book is in fact a short and compact survey of\r\nthe whole field of psychical research, dealing in two sections with physical\r\nand psychical evidence of survival and in a third with alternative\r\nexplanations of the phenomena.\r\nAlthough the subject-matter is so condensed, a very fair and clear\r\npresentation is given, with numerous examples from the literature of the\r\nbest-known writers on the subject, and from the Proceedings of the S.P.R.\r\nand the A.S.P.R., of all the various types of phenomena which have been\r\nattributed to departed spirits. The book is throughout informed both by\r\nthe writer's lively interest in the problem as well as by his natural good\r\nsense. His condemnation of some of the excesses, in triviality or ludicrousness, of so-called evidential phenomena is never bitter ; and he shows\r\nthe true scientific spirit in the ' irresistible attraction ' which, as he says,\r\nthis blank page in the book of science exercises on him. In the face of\r\nthe little that we can learn at present, however, to him ' doubt becomes\r\na duty '.\r\nJ. R.\r\nThe Journal of Parapsychology, Vol. XII, No. i, March 1948.\r\n(Durham, North Carolina : Duke University Press.)\r\nThis number of the Journal of Parapsychology contains the first contributions to an interesting series of opinions on a research programme\r\nin parapsychology for the next ten years. Those whose contributions are printed in this number are : Ehrenwald, Hart, Gardner Murphy, Pratt,\r\nPrice, Miss Reeves, Soal, Tyrrell and West. It will be seen that the\r\nEnglish S.P.R. is generously represented. There seems to be a considerable measure of agreement as to immediate objectives of research. A\r\nnumber of the contributors emphasise the importance of discovering means of increasing the rates of scoring of ordinary subjects : by drugs,\r\nhypnosis or mental exercises. Several consider that a fruitful line of\r\nresearch is the investigation of personality differences related to parapsychological success. There seems to be some difference of opinion as\r\n256 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research june-july 1948\r\nto the value of the investigation of psychokinesis as a research project.\r\nPsychometry, survival and precognition are also mentioned as subjects\r\nfor future investigation.\r\nElizabeth McMahan and Joan Lauer record results of experiments in\r\nextra-sensory perception when the agent and cards were in an unknownlocality. There was no significant deviation from chance expectation in\r\ntotal hits, but a marginally significant decline effect was found. It might\r\nhave been worth while to have done a series for comparison with the same\r\nagent and experimenter when the location was not unknown. Further\r\ncombinations of conditions suggest themselves, such as a comparison of\r\nknown and unknown location under PC conditions, the effect of the\r\nlocation of the cards (under PC conditions) being unknown to the agent\r\nas well as to the experimenter, etc. Professor Rhine contributes a valuable article on conditions favouring\r\nsuccess in psi tests. The rate of success amongst ordinary subjects has\r\nbeen higher at Duke University than any that we have found here. It is well that we should learn all we can of how they do it there. British\r\nworkers may have concentrated sometimes too much on rigidity of\r\nconditions while losing sight of the necessity to establish conditions\r\nleading to fruitful results. But it is to be noted that Whately Carington\r\nin his drawing experiments also got better results from Duke University\r\nparticipants than from those over here. So the difference may be not\r\nonly in methods but also in the subjects. It may be due to a tradition of success having established itself at Duke ; if so, we may hope to establish a similar tradition here. It may be a difference in climate, diet, or any\r\nof a number of other possible variables. Clearly there is something to be\r\nfound out about this difference. R. H. T.\r\nA Casebook for Survival. Collected and arranged by A. P. Baird.\r\n(London : Psychic Press. 282 pp. los. 6d.)\r\nIn this sequel to his earlier book A Hundred Cases for Survival MrBaird has collected a second hundred well-known cases which he considers\r\nprovide evidence indicating survival after death. He describes the book\r\nas an attempt to meet the requirements of the ' sceptical and critical\r\n\r\nand ' though it may fail to satisfy their canons of evidence, nevertheless it may rouse some curiosity on the enigma of survival '. The cases are presented under eight headings\u2014Dreams, Haunted Houses, Apparitions,\r\nDeath-Bed Visions, Automatic Writing, Trance Phenomena, Direct\r\nVoice, and Materialisation\u2014each prefaced by the compiler's commentaries on the various hypotheses which have been put forward.\r\nTalks with Elizabethans. By Percy Allen. (London : Rider. 216 pp.\r\nIllus. 15s.)\r\nMr Allen's book contains a record of communications purporting to come from William Shakespeare, Edward de Vere, seventeenth Earl of\r\nOxford, and Francis Bacon. The scripts were produced by automatic\r\nwriting in sittings with Mrs Hester Dowden in 1944 and 1945. MrAllen had been for many years previously a leading exponent of the view\r\nthat the greater part of Shakespeare's plays, and also the Sonnets, were\r\nJUNE-JULY 1948 Reviews 257\r\nthe work of the Earl of Oxford. Mrs Dowden's scripts confirmed his\r\nview. He does not beUeve that the information was derived from his\r\nown subconscious mind nor from Mrs Dowden but that it came\r\ndirectly from discarnate Elizabethan intelligences. He considers, however, that the communications were facilitated, on his own part by a previous Elizabethan incarnation, and in the case of Mrs Dowden by her\r\nconnexion, through her father, with Shakespearean scholarship. Nowhere\r\nin the scripts is verifiable information given which could not have been\r\navailable by normal means to either medium or sitter.\r\nRosemary for Remembrance. By Clifford Bax. (London : Frederick\r\nMuller. 1948. 207 pp. Illus. 12s. 6d.)\r\nAmong these essays and reminiscences written with Mr Bax's usual\r\nurbanity and elegance of style is an abbreviated account of sittings with\r\nMrs Pamela Nash. At two of these, objects associated with E. V. Lucas,\r\nwho had died about eight months previously, were given to the medium,\r\nand Mr Bax is satisfied that she had no means of knowing anything about\r\ntheir history. Much of the information given appears from Mr Bax's\r\ncomments to be strikingly applicable to Mr Lucas, but it is, of course, impossible to form a considered judgment without access to the verbatim\r\nrecord of the sittings.\r\nBooks re-issued\r\nGrades of Significance.

D. Broad, who is acquainted with\r\nDr Bjorkhem's work. Although the article has been condensed, the subject's statement and all other relevant remarks are given in full.\r\n. The experiment was carried out at 8.30 p.m. on November 22nd, 1945.\r\nSix different objects had been put into envelopes or parcels, which were open either at one side or both ends so that one hand could be inserted\r\nThe subject, Mrs Helga Braconnier, a lady fifty years of age engaged in\r\nsocial work at Malmo, selected one of the envelopes. She was then put mto a hypnotic sleep and made the following statement, during which no\r\nanswers were given to any of the remarks made in question form :\r\n' This lady is very fond of wool, she is very chilly. She is a nice\r\nperson, but she cries very much. Does she cry because she is ill or what IS the matter with her.? Has she some illness in her side? Had 'she asthma.? It is hard for her to breathe, she has singing in her ears When she was young she was so cheerful. She is unhappy about something. Very unfortunate. Thinks she has nothing to live for, she is anxious, has she been ill before?\r\n' Was it suicide? There was a post mortem on her. I see white coats about her. She had been ill in her stomach before. You look up books\r\nabout her. There is a nasty smell around her. Was there something\r\nto do with her neck?\r\n' Someone came to see her a couple of days before, and after that she was unhappy.\r\n' She was alone at the moment when it happened, at first she was\r\nindoors, then outside. She lay prone with her face downwards so that one saw her back. I believe that she lay and floated ; it was near the\r\nwater's edge. She lay with her face downwards. She has floated against something. She was not undressed. One ring on her finger. Were\r\n1 Natur och Kulturs Bokforlag, S: t Eriksplan, Stockholm. \u2022\r\n'\r\n.\r\n264 Joiir7ml of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nthere reeds or something of the kind there? It was an odd time of year\r\nto be drowned ; it was not bathing-time and she was not undressed\r\neither. I see no leaves on the trees. Was it autumn or spring ; most\r\nUkely autumn? I see slush there ; it was thawing. A blouse and a skirt. The blouse was not properly put on. Blue blouse, some buttons are done up, not all. She was rather untidy. She was swollen up above the\r\nheart. A hard fight for her. Was it suicide, but did she regret it?\r\n' A man is involved in it, but he is not guilty of her death. She was at loggerheads with her husband. He was taken up with someone else,\r\nand she knew it. Was he not called Nils or Johan or Jons? Did he sell\r\ncorn? He had to do with corn. Many people came and went. Theytalked about him. He was mean towards her. She seems to work a lot. He often went away. Strong feelings are involved. They think of\r\nmoving from the place. Another lady means much to him. Everyoneknew that the marriage was not happy because of certain circumstances.\r\nThe other lady is in difficulties now.\r\n' She was a little older than he. She had so-to-speak taken him mhand and helped him. Her parents didn't want her to have him. Sheliked someone when she was young who went to America. Now she has\r\nhad to share her husband with another woman. Had she a sister whowas perhaps called Mary? I hear that name. She was married.\r\n' I see a photograph of her in an oval frame. She was fond of hermother. Seldom happy in latter years. Able in her way, but she didn't\r\nunderstand love. She had thick arms and a high forehead.\r\n' Many people at the burial. She was not popular, but they weremoved by the report of the death. A light rain afterwards ; I see\r\nyellow flowers. A bell rings somewhere. She lies to the left as oneenters the churchyard, beside a little grave. . Did they have a child whodied young? The grave is ill-kept, I see leaves and weeds. Probably nostone there. It was best for her to die. She was older than he.\r\n' There were three rooms in their house, it was in the country. Thehouse had been enlarged. Something has been found in the drawers.\r\nWere there complications with a P.O. savings book? Had she a loomthere? She had home-woven aprons with tassels. Something which shehad begun had to be finished afterwards. On the sideboard stood a\r\nshell-frame. There was an ornamental dog too.\r\n' The husband likes to lead rather a gay life. He takes grog now andthen. He is a little foxy ; I don't like him.\r\n' Was something on her torn? Had it got torn because she had hit\r\nagainst an edge? Had she an abrasion on her leg or had she varicose\r\nveins ?\r\n' They lived in the country. It was a mill. I see a mill. I see her godown but she went on the other side of the mill. It happened in autumnin the evening. She stood up on an edge. There was a jetty there. Butwhat was she doing with a little tub, then? I see a small tub. It lay\r\nthere, it is bound with iron. He can't bear to see it. The tub explainedcertain things, but it has not been there all the time.\r\n' There was a hoop there near a pile. The tub has been mentionedin the police report. Men in uniform came thither in a car. One of themis fat and strong. Her husband does not mourn much for her, she had\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Esarp Tragedy 265\r\nsometimes neglected him. He thinks that it is painful. He is not guilty\r\nof her death. He did not push her in, but the circumstances looked\r\nblack for him. Is the man ill, or where is he? In some way he still has\r\nto do with her. In some way he is not free from her. Where is he.' Away somewhere?\r\n' He has been under investigation in an office several times.'\r\nThe envelope which Mrs Braconnier had chosen contained a photograph\r\nof Hanna Andersson taken after she had been found dead in February 1932,\r\nand wearing the same clothes in which she was clad at the time of her death.\r\nThe following is an account of the tragedy : During the morning of February 22nd, 1932, Hanna Andersson, aged 53,\r\nwife of the miller Nils Andersson, who was somewhat younger than she, was found dead in the mill-pool at Esarp, near Lund. In the pool was a\r\njetty, and she had obviously fallen from it, dead or alive, into the water.\r\nOn the jetty was the hd of a coffee-pot, and coffee lees which had been\r\nthrown out. On dragging the pool the coffee-pot was also found. Mrs\r\nAndersson was wont to wash out the coffee-pot from the jetty, and she must\r\ntherefore somehow or other have got into the water while doing this job\r\nthe night before, i.e. February 21st. . On February 29th the miller Nils Andersson was arrested on suspicion\r\nof murdering his wife. On February 24th Prof. E. Sjovall had conducted\r\nthe post mortem on the deceased at the pathological institute in Lund, in the presence of policemen and several doctors of medicine and m.edical\r\nstudents.\r\nAt the inquest it was established, among other things, that the deceased was 170 cm. in height (she weighed 108 kg.). On the right lower leg was an\r\nabrasion of the shin immediately below the knee. (Report of the Inquest,\r\n\u00a7 4-)\r\nOn her neck were found an abrasion of the skin and two red streaks\r\nstretching up to the right and to the left. The left streak was more noticeable than the right. She was clad in a jacket, a bodice, a woollen vest, an\r\nunder-vest, and a chemise (\u00a717). It was testified that she was poorly clad. Some of her garments were ragged (\u00a73). \u2022 Before the clothes were removed\r\nthe photograph used in the experiment was taken.\r\nThe heart weighed 500 gms., the left chamber was specially big (\u00a735).\r\nThe liver weighed 3000 gms. (\u00a737). The stomach contained i litre of\r\npartly ill-digested food (\u00a740). The large arteries showed extensive\r\narterio-sclerosis and a considerable deposit of lime (\u00a747).\r\nThe conclusion of the report of the inquest says, iiiter alia, that the cause\r\nof death could not be determined with complete certainty, and that Mrs.\r\nAndersson was probably alive when she entered the water.\r\nFrom the police investigation it appeared further that the Anderssons\r\nhad thought of selling their property, the mill and dwelling-house or a part of it ; that there had been talk of a legal separation between them ; and that Andersson kept up a connexion with an eighteen-year old girl\r\nfrom the district who had formerly been in his service. The wife was well aware of this connexion. He used often to make expeditions with his\r\nmistress to Malmo and Copenhagen. He had last spent the night with her on February 20th or 21st in Malmo. He lived a pretty gay life away from\r\n266 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nhome. About two hundred restaurant bills, etc. were found at his house.\r\nHis relations with his wife had not been marked by any special discord, but\r\nshe had on occasion quarrelled with him when he came home drunk. Hehad had his driving licence withdrawn on the ground of driving while\r\nintoxicated. He had also been accused of forgery. He was well-known\r\nand much talked of in the district. Some described him as ' sly ' and\r\n' deceitful '. In his evidence. Nils Andersson stated that his wife always liked to wear\r\na great deal of clothing, that she had suffered from singing in the ears for\r\nseveral years, that she was liable to giddiness, and that she always did as\r\nlittle housework as possible.\r\nAndersson was accused of wilful murder of his wife ; and although it could not be proved with certainty that she died through criminal assault\r\nand he energetically declared himself throughout to be innocent, the\r\nevidence against him was held to be so serious that he was condemned to penal servitude for life. The judgment was confirmed by the Lower Court\r\nof Appeal and the Supreme Court, though in each of these certain members\r\nwere unwilling to declare him guilty. When he had been in prison long\r\nenough for it to be possible for him to appeal for pardon he refused to do\r\nso, since he did not think that he could ask pardon for ' something which\r\nhe had not done '. Eventually, an appeal for a new trial was granted by\r\nthe Supreme Court of Appeal, and on November 29th, 1947, he was declared innocent and granted the right to receive compensation for his\r\nfifteen years' imprisonment.\r\nDr Bjorkhem points out that the subject was incorrect in her statement\r\nthat it rained on the day of Mrs Andersson's burial, and that her grave had\r\nno stone, and observes that many of the details which she gave cannot be\r\nverified. He remarks, however, that it is possible that a more detailed\r\ninvestigation would reveal further points of agreement, but that this could\r\nscarcely be of decisive importance since the subject's statement seems in all essential points to have had something in common with the Esarp tragedy.\r\nWhen the experiment took place, Dr Bjorkhem had only a general idea\r\nof the tragedy, and knew nothing of the details. At the end of the experiment, when Mrs Braconnier was told what it related to, she could not re- member where or when the tragedy took place. It was not till she was told\r\nthat it happened in 1932 and that Esarp was near Lund that she remembered anything of the affair. She had no clear knowledge of it, however,\r\nand she did not even know that it concerned three persons. Dr Bjorkhem\r\nobserve? that she experienced a mass of details of which she could not\r\npossibly have been aware, even if she had tried in 1932 to find out as muchas possible about the case. Dr Bjorkhem describes the experiment as neither better nor worse than\r\nmost of those which have been carried out with Mrs Braconnier.\r\nIn reply to an enquiry from the Research Officer, Mrs Hellstrom\r\nquoted Dr Bjorkhem as stating that it was not impossible for Mrs Braconnier to have peered into the envelope, but that he was observing her and\r\nshe could not have done so without his noticing it and he is quite positive\r\nthat she did not. Dr Bjorkhem tells us, however, that ' almost all the time\r\nduring the sitting I was alone with the medium '. It must, therefore, have\r\nSEPT. 1948 Investigation of a Case of Xenoglossy 267\r\nbeen difficult for him to keep her continuously under observation while\r\ntaking notes at the same time. The case would, of course, be evidentially more satisfying had it been possible for the envelope to remain sealed until\r\nthe end of the sitting. Nevertheless, Dr Bjorkhem points out that the\r\nmedium experienced details of which she could not have been aware even if she had tried thirteen years before to find out as much as possible about the\r\ncase, i.e. because she would not have had access to the post mortem report.\r\nIt might be an interesting exercise for the reader to compare the details\r\nquoted from the post mortem report with those given by the medium.\r\nThe interest of Dr Bjorkhem's experiment will be increased if confirmatory material can be obtained from the same medium working in cooperation with the Society.\r\nINVESTIGATION OF A CASE OF XENOGLOSSY\r\nBy D. J. West\r\nProminently featured in Psychic Nezvs of January 31st, February 14th,\r\nand March 27th, 1948, were accounts of remarkable phenomena obtained\r\nthrough two mediums, Mr Joseph Thomason and Mr Albert Daniels,\r\nwho had been receiving alleged spirit communications for several years.\r\nThe phenomena which formed the subject of these accounts took place\r\nat a private circle held in the home of Mrs Augusta Frankel in Muswell\r\nHill. The two mediums passed into trance states and were controlled by\r\n' guides ' who spoke through them in foreign tongues, e.g. African and\r\nChinese, of which neither Mr Thomason (a bricklayer) nor Mr Daniels\r\n(a storeman) had any knowledge. In an article ' 100 Years of Spiritualism ', the magazine Illustrated, in the issue for April 3rd, 1948, reproduced five photographs of this circle showing the mediums with faces contorted in\r\nChinese and African ' transfigurations '. The particular interest of this case lay in the testimony of a Professor\r\nAladini of the School of Oriental and African studies, London University,\r\nwho stated that on several occasions when he was present at the circle he\r\nreceived through Mr Thomason communications in the Mende language of\r\nCentral Africa, which was his native tongue. Aladini claimed to have\r\nidentified and conversed in his own language with several Mende spirits.\r\nThe Research Officer sent a note of enquiry to Professor Aladini, but no\r\nreply was received. Authorities at the School of Oriental and African\r\nStudies were approached, but they denied that Aladini was a professor at that institution ; in fact his connection with them seemed rather nebulous.\r\nA determined attempt to investigate the obscure ' languages ' spoken by\r\nthese mediums was made by the International Language Club in Croydon.\r\nThe mediums became entranced and spoke before a large audience\r\nincluding ' Chinese with a knowledge of up to twenty dialects ; Africans,\r\nmainly from Nigeria in the West ; Indians and Pakistani drawn from the\r\nwhole surface of their subcontinent ; and individuals from fifty other\r\ndifferent countries '.^ The result was disappointing. ' All that could be\r\n^ S. Brooke-Wavell, Secretary of the International Language Club, writing in Psychic News, March 13th, 1948.\r\n268 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nsaid on the evidence was that two mediums had gone into a trance,\r\ncontorted their features to a negroid shape, and spoken in convincing tones\r\nsounds which no one could understand.\r\nThis investigation was incomplete, because none of those present at the\r\nInternational Language Club could speak Mende, the language which\r\nAladini said he could recognise. The Research Officer, therefore, arranged\r\na seance at which an expert in the Mende language was present. Also\r\npresent were Mr Abdy Collins and Mr Leslie Howard of Psychic News,\r\nMr J. F. Nicol, and a technician who recorded the trance speeches.\" Here\r\nis the expert's report :^\r\n' On May 19th, 1948 I attended a seance in the capacity of phonetic\r\nexpert in African languages, bringing with me an African teacher of the\r\nMende tribe, as it had been alleged that messages in the Mende language\r\nhad come through on previous occasions. The room was fitted with\r\nmicrophone and recording facilities, and the two mediums, Mr Daniels\r\nand Mr Thomason, were recorded when in their trance. The following\r\nis an analysis of what we heard.\r\n' Both mediums spoke very volubly, and Mr Thomason sang. Their\r\nspeech bore no resemblance, not even in phonetic structure, to any\r\nknown West African language, nor did the song bear any resemblance,\r\nin its tone sequences or rhythm, to anything West African. In addition,\r\nthere was little correspondence in the speech of the two mediums, Mr\r\nDaniels using pharyngeal consonants very frequently, and Mr Thomason\r\nspecialising in \" ch \" and \" sh \" sounds. Mr Daniels' intonation took\r\nthe general pattern\u2014low, mid, low : Mr Thomason's intonation was more declamatory, starting high, and tailing off, as in English.\r\n' Mr Daniels' face underwent contortions which could be described\r\nas \" negroid \" in that the lips and the lower jaw protruded considerably.\r\nSome of the sounds he produced (phon. q y Arabic : {J> ^^)are common\r\nto certain North East African languages, but he did not speak any such\r\nlanguage, as far as I could judge. When his normal self, however, he\r\nseemed to be unable to imitate words containing these sounds. Mr\r\nThomason's face underwent no great transformation, and the sounds he\r\nproduced were such as any average Englishman could imitate.\r\n' I was specifically asked if they spoke Chinese, but could reply that\r\nneither used Chinese nor Japanese speech sounds.\r\n' During the course of the seance, my Mende colleague addressed some remarks in that language to Mr Thomason and received long and\r\nvoluble replies which were quite unintelligible.\r\n' The strong inference is that the words of both mediums were\r\nmeaningless, as the same sound sequences were repeated over and over\r\nagain\u2014much as with a baby in the \" babbling \" stage of speech development. Although both mediums changed their \" controls \" from time to time (Mr Daniels at one time speaking in a falsetto voice), the absence\r\n1 Ibid.\r\n^ This record has been deposited at the Society's rooms.\r\n^ On account of the official position which they hold, these experts do' not wish\r\ntheir names to be quoted, but they are known to the Society and their bona fid''s is without question.\r\nSEPT. 1948 The O.J.L. Posthumous Packet 269\r\nof any change in the phonetic content of their words would seem to indicate that there had been no change in \" language \".' '\r\nAlthough it seems clear that the claim to polyglot mediumship is in this case unfounded, the languages being apparently meaningless gibberish,\r\nthis does not necessarily imply bad faith on the mediums' part. They both\r\nseemed sincere, and could easily have excused themselves from being\r\nrecorded had they so desired. Like so many mediums of this type, it is probable they were themselves misled by the assumption that incomprehensible sounds which came to the lips involuntarily must constitute some\r\nforeign language. Meaningless scrawls and scribbles are common enough\r\nin early attempts at automatic writing, and doubtless in rudimentary forms\r\nof automatic speech, gibberish is equally common. In this case the mediums\r\nwere probably further misled by the extraordinary claims of Mr Aladini,\r\nfor which no substantiation is discoverable. Neither medium made any\r\ncomment when told the opinion of the experts at the end of the sitting.\r\nTHE O.J.L. POSTHUMOUS PACKET\r\nBy G. N. M. Tyrrell\r\nNearly eight years have elapsed since Sir Oliver Lodge died, having left a sealed packet to be dealt with after his death. This, he suggested,\r\nshould be referred to under the above title. It is felt that the committee\r\nappointed by the S.P.R. to deal with this packet should now make an\r\ninterim report in the Society's ^Joz^rwcZ on what has been done. This falls to my lot as chairman.\r\nThe relevant facts known about the sealed packet are as follows : In 1930 Sir Oliver Lodge prepared a sealed packet and deposited it with\r\nthe S.P.R. This I will call A. In addition four other sealed envelopes were prepared, which I shall call B, C, D, and E. B, C, and D, were\r\nleft in charge of the S.P.R. E was deposited with the London Spiritualist\r\nAlliance.\r\nB. This was prepared in 1907. On the outside of the envelope it was\r\nstated that the contents included the name of the Imperator control as communicated to Stainton Moses. The envelope is still unopened ; but\r\nit is considered useless as a test because the name in question was given in a book a good many years ago by Trethewy.\r\nC. This was prepared in 193 1, and is stated to be supplementary to A.\r\nOn the outside of the envelope it is stated that another sealed envelope, C i,\r\nis contained within, which is to be opened after envelopes A and E have\r\nbeen opened.\r\nD. This is another supplementary envelope, and it is stated that it is to be opened last. E. This envelope, deposited with the L.S.A., bears the instruction that\r\nit may be freely opened ' when the time comes ', as there is another\r\nenvelope, E i, inside.\r\nIt is known that the sealed packet. A, contains six envelopes, A i, A ii, etc. to A vi, one inside another. So far, A i, A ii and A iii have been opened by\r\n270 Journal of The Society for Psychical Researcli sept. 1948\r\nthe committee ; but no hint is given in these of what the innermostenvelope contains. The plan, however, is known. Each after the third of\r\nthese six envelopes contains a hint which is intended to guide the mind of\r\nSir Oliver Lodge towards the contents of the innermost envelope, A vi. Sir Oliver Lodge died in August 1940. In February 1947 a committeeconsisting of Mr Brodie Lodge, Miss Norah Lodge (son and daughter of\r\nSir Oliver), Dr R. H. Thouless, The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas, MissMercy Phillimore, Dr D. J. West, and Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell was appointed\r\nto deal with the matter.\r\nIt may be said at once that, for reasons stated below, the matter has not\r\nyet been finally concluded.\r\nThe following is a summary of what is known about the contents of the\r\ninnermost envelope, Avi. From a statement written by O. J. L. onJune loth, 1930, we learn : ' It is an exceedingly trivial thing that nobodyknows anything about and that is what makes it suitable.' On the back of the first envelope A i (inside an outer wrapper) we read :\r\n' The details are so numerous that they could not be guessed nor could they\r\nbe inferred.' Inside the second envelope, A ii, it is stated that :\r\n' It is not an incident or an episode and not possible to be guessed.' A letter fromO. J. L. to Mr Piddington dated June 13th, 1930, contains the statement :\r\n' An absurd thing and unworth mention, except for this special purpose.'\r\nInside the third envelope, A iii, was found the following :\r\n' If you have hadan opportunity of consulting me about the posthumous packages, try to remind me of something that trivially rather obsessed my life, that wasnot of the slightest consequence, and that I never mentioned to anyone.\r\nThat is why it is chosen as a test. See if you can put me on the right lines or in the right frame for remembering.' Then follows a post-script :\r\n' Don't proceed further until you have had an opportunity of doing this.' We have, then, these items of information : (i) that the message is extremely trivial, (2) that it contains numerous details, (3) that it cannot be\r\nguessed or inferred, (4) that it rather obsessed Sir Oliver's mind during his\r\nlife, (5) that it is not an incident or an episode which occurred during his\r\nlife, (6) that it is unknown to anyone else. Any communication purporting\r\nto give the contents of envelope A vi must therefore, if it gives them correctly, conform to these six items of information.\r\nIn the meanwhile a number of communications, said to refer to the sealed\r\npacket, were received by the S.P.R. from various persons. Some of these were marked :\r\n' Not to be opened until the sealed packet is opened.'\r\nThese are still unopened. The rest, not so marked, have been opened and\r\nexamined and separated into two groups, those which make a definite claim\r\nto give the contents of the sealed packet, and those which do not. Thelatter were found to be too vague to have any recognisable relevance to the\r\ntest. The former in no case state a content which agrees with all the six items of knowledge mentioned above, except for one which describes a complicated cipher, not easy to follow.\r\nThe difficulty presented by Sir Oliver Lodge's scheme is that it presupposes a condition which the committee has not so far been able to realise.\r\nIt will be seen from the above instructions which he left that he assumes\r\nthat the experimenter will be in free communication with him through some medium or automatist. The experimenter is instructed (a) first to\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Fox Sisters \u2022\r\n\u2022 271\r\nget in touch with O. J. L., (b) then to give O. J. L. a stimulus-hint from the\r\nnext envelope in the series when he asks for it, {c) then to tell O. J. L.\r\nwhat he (the experimenter) has gathered from what O.J.L. has told him,\r\n{d) then to wait until O. J. L. says he is satisfied before he opens the next\r\nenvelope in the series. For example, one of the instructions left by O. J. L.\r\nreads :\r\n' I want to be told hereafter what I have written in each envelope\r\nas a reminder.' And again :\r\n' If anyone thinks they have got a complete\r\nstatement they should read it over to me slowly, so that I could correct it where necessary.'\r\nNo such clear and unambiguous conditions of communication with\r\nO. J. L. have been reached by the committee. Consequently, when at the\r\nthird envelope we read the instruction that we were not to proceed further\r\nuntil we had had an opportunity of putting O. J. L. on the right lines for\r\nremembering the message, we were in an impasse.\r\nThe only course now open to the committee is to wait until conditions\r\nare realised in which question and answer between the sitter and the\r\nO. J. L. communicator can freely and clearly take place : or else until a message, which claims to give the contents of envelope A vi, and which\r\nagrees with the six items of information given by Sir Oliver Lodge during\r\nhis lifetime, is received. No such message has so far been obtained in the course of the sittings which the committee has organised or through\r\nprivate sources. The committee wishes to thank those who have assisted by taking part\r\nin the research.\r\nTHE FOX SISTERS AND THE DEVELOPMENT ' OF SPIRITUALISM\r\nBy J. Eraser Nicol\r\nHave you not learned, I asked, that our soul is immortal,\r\nand never dies?\r\nHe looked at me, and said in amazement: No, really, I have not ; but can you maintain this doctrine?\r\nYes, as I am an honest man, I replied ; and I think you\r\ncould also. It is quite easy to do it. The Republic, Book X\r\nBelief in immortality or in some form of survival of the mind or spirit after the crisis of bodily death has characterized the writings and beliefs of\r\nmany religious leaders, philosophers, and ordinary people through all history. Quotations like the above, though from less distinguished sources, can readily be cited from all succeeding centuries. Strange occurrences of\r\napparently psychical nature have been reported in all ages, but it was not\r\nuntil the middle of the nineteenth century that extensive claims were made\r\nto the establishment of reciprocal communications between the living and\r\nthe dead.\r\nThe suddenness of Spititualism's appearance upon an unexpecting world\r\n272 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nis a circumstance that invariably surprises the new inquirer into the history\r\nof that remarkable movement. Frank Podmore (i) held the view that\r\nSpiritualism was the natural outgrowth of Animal Magnetism and its con-comitant the induced trance, which grew and developed out of the work ofFranz Mesmer from 1773 onwards.\r\nPodmore's view is no doubt sound so far as it goes ; but something moreshould be said. To have professed powers of mediumship in any age after the Reformatian would have been a confession of Witchcraft. In Englandthe last attempt of Parliament to suppress ' conjuration, witchcraft, anddealings with evil and wicked spirits ' was represented by the Act of 1604(I Jac. I., c. 12). All spirits were presumably assumed to be evil. Thatstatute remained in active use until well on in the eighteenth century whenthe legislators of that enlightened age repealed it (1736), and thus, in the\r\nwords of an historian ' a stop was put to . . . ignorant cruelty, and the\r\nstatute book relieved of a portion of its load of trumpery ' (2).\r\nIn England the last judicial execution for witchcraft was carried out at Huntingdon in 1716, when a woman and her daughter, aged nine years, were hanged for selling their souls to Satan. In Scotland the last such exe- cution took place in 1722. Notwithstanding the repeal of the Act, the practice of communion with the Unseen (as was supposed) remained a danger-ous occupation, and in 1751 a reputed witch named Ruth Osborne andher husband were ducked and murdered by a mob at Tring in Hertfordshire. Judicial executions of witches continued on the Continent longafter they were abolished in England. In Poland two women were burnedas late as 1793 (3).\r\nMesmerism is important in the history of Spiritualism for two reasons.\r\nFirst, there is the similarity of the magnetic sleep and the mediumistictrance ; but this is so evident as to require no emphasis, and it need notdetain us. Second, in the year 1843, the mystic Andrew Jackson Davis(1826-1910) of Poughkeepsie, New York, was successfully thrown into a magnetic sleep. The experiment was repeated on many subsequentoccasions in the course of which the entranced seer expounded the longand complex body of doctrine known as the Harmonial Philosophy.\r\nDavis's teaching was written down for him by an amanuensis and publishedin a long series of massive volumes. The ' philosophy ' professes to give an account of the origin and nature of the universe, of the solar system in\r\nparticular and of man's place and purpose in it. More important, he gavea description of the separation of the ' spirit ' from the body at the time ofdeath, of the arrival of the discarnate being in the Other World, and of life thereafter through all eternity.\r\nThe fundamental writings of Davis were produced before 1848, and as might be surmised he is regarded by Spiritualists to-day as the John the\r\nBaptist of their Movement. Insofar as Spiritualism has been guided in its oeliefs by any one teacher, that teacher is A. J. Davis. Before the FoxSisters were heard of he predicted the coming of the day when the ' truth\r\n'\r\n(of spiritual communion) 'will ere long present itself in the form of a living\r\ndemonstration '. He foretold that the new era in which ' spiritual com-munion will be established ' would be hailed by the world ' with delight ', a prediction which has not been literally fulfilled, as will be seen in the\r\nsequel. Believers speak and write of Davis with words of reverence, a\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Fox Sisters 273\r\nfeeling that is made all the stronger and certain to them by reason of a celebrated entry in his ' notes ', under the memorable date March 31st, 1848 :\r\nAbout daylight this morning a warm breathing passed over my face and\r\nI heard a voice, tender and strong, saying :\r\n' Brother, the good work has\r\nbegun\u2014behold, a living demonstration is born '. I was left wondering\r\nwhat could be meant by such a message.\r\nNot at daylight (when the ' voice ' spoke to Davis) but some hours after dusk the same day, Modern Spiritualism as we now know it, was born.\r\nThe birthplace, as is well known, was the hamlet of Hydesville, which lies beyond the Catskill Mountains some 200 miles to the north-northwest of\r\nDavis's Poughkeepsie.\r\nThe early history of the Fox family is lost in mystery. A new account^\r\nof the lives of the three Fox sisters has been published in this the centenary\r\nyear of Spiritualism. The writer, is Mrs Mariam Pond whose first husband was a grandson of David Fox, the only brother of the three mediums. Mrs\r\nPond says she is the only remaining member of the Fox family who retains an interest in Spiritualism. For thirty years she has been collecting information about the Foxes and has been given ' access to papers and letters\r\n'\r\nnot hitherto published. Unfortunately, she hardly ever gives a clue to the sources of her information, and so far as it can be traced it does not appear\r\nthat the new material adds substantially to our knowledge. On the other\r\nhand, Mrs Pond writes with a measure of impartiality that is wholly admirable, coming as it does from one who is so intimately connected with the\r\nFox family. ' The story,' she says, ' is told without reservation. There is no one left to be hurt.' The book lacks an index, and occasional references\r\nto it in this article will be indicated by (P) followed by the page number.\r\nThe Fox parents, John David Fox and Margaret Smith, were both born\r\nin 1787, were married in 1812 and in the first eight years of their married\r\nlife had five children, of whom only Leah is of interest to us. Fox was a blacksmith and intermittently a drunkard. The psychological effect of his\r\nweakness upon the lives of his children is hard to estimate\u2014except that at least two of them followed in his steps many years later. For about ten\r\nyears Fox seems to have been separated from his family. When the last two children Margaretta (usually known as Maggie) and Catherine (Kate) were born, most of the other members of the family were already grown\r\nup. Leah was about 23 and had been married at the age of 14. There is some uncertainty as to the age of the two youngest children. According\r\nto the earliest writer (4) Kate, the younger by two years, was 12 when the\r\ndisturbances broke out. According to other authorities (5, 6, 7, 8) her\r\nage was variously 6|, 9 and 11. Mrs Pond does not help matters by giving\r\nKate's age on page 21 as 12, and on page 420 as 1 1 ; she also provides two\r\nages for Margaret.\r\nWhilst the father of the famous girls remains a shadowy, silent figure,\r\nthe mother stands out bold, purposeful, and alive. It is disclosed that\r\n' the capacity for adventure lay within her ' (P. 19). Though by nature\r\n^ The Unwilling Martyrs : The Story of the Fox Family. By Mariam\r\nBuckner Pond. (London: Spiritualist Press. 1947. 424 pp. 15s.)\r\n1\r\n274 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nreticent and cautious, once she had conceived a course of action in her mindshe never looked over her shoulder. For years she was the impressario\r\nof her two younger daughters, travelling with them everywhere through\r\nthe eastern States. In large measure Mrs Fox's character was inherited by her eldest daughter Leah. This volatile young woman possessed powers of leadership and\r\na relentless will that were wholly absent in her younger sisters. If the\r\nyounger children were the originators of Spiritualism, Leah it was whowrought it into a Movement that swept across the United States and round\r\nthe world. Had the affair been left in the hands of the younger children\r\nand their mother it is doubtful if it would have become (at that time) any more than a local nine days' wonder. But in some singular way Leah\r\npossessed the vision to see the possibilities of the rappings. To this sense\r\nof the long view she added gifts as an organiser which were completely\r\nlacking in her sisters, even had they been old enough to exercise them.\r\nOpposition to her proposals and wishes she at all times crushed with a\r\nrelentless vigour. The explorer Elisha Kane, himself a man of fiery will,\r\nwho became the husband of Margaret, described Leah as ' The Tigress '. The usefulness of Margaret and Kate rested entirely in their supposed\r\ngifts of mediumship\u2014in the demonstration of which they far surpassed\r\ntheir elder sister\u2014and a certain physical grace and loveliness, to which\r\ntheir elder sister could lay no claim. At a seance in Washington, in the\r\nheyday of their mediumistic glory, ' One very fine-looking man stood up\r\nbefore the crowd and addressed them thus : \" . . . . This is all humbug,\r\nbut it is worth a dollar to sit in the sunlight of Miss Kate's eyes. \" ' (P. 182).\r\nKate had large grey eyes, and ' soft brown hair '. So much for her exter- nal attractiveness ; on the other hand. Lord Rayleigh, who had her as a\r\nvisitor to his house at a much later date, said that she seldom or never made an intelligent remark (15).\r\nThe rappings which are said to have distressed the Fox household for\r\nmonths, came to a head on March 31st, 1848. The time seems to have\r\nbeen late evening and the family had retired to bed. It should be noted\r\nthat Leah, at this period a music teacher, was living many miles away at Rochester and heard nothing of the commotions for more than a month.\r\nWhatever the cause of the knocks, the important matter is that on this\r\nnight the child Kate spoke back to the alleged operator and got an intelli- gent reply. ' Do as I do, Mr Splitfoot! ' she cried and clapped her hands.\r\nThe sounds were echoed in raps (P. 23). Then Mrs Fox asked, ' Are you a\r\nspirit.' If you are, rap twice.' Two knocks, and the World of Spirit, and\r\nthe gates of Andrew Jackson Davis's Summerland lay open. So the knockings and the messages went on during that memorable night, right on into\r\nthe following morning which, as the child Kate remarked, was the first of\r\nApril. Knock by knock there emerged the story of the murdered pedlar\r\nand his complaint that his bones were buried under the house. Neighbours were summoned and the village was agog.\r\nThe Foxes forsook their wooden house, but the restless spirit pursued\r\nthem. It demanded digging operations in the cellar, a request to which\r\nthe dismayed family demurred. Then in the month of May Leah unexpectedly arrived, and grasping the situation and most of its implications,\r\ntook charge of the affair with a strong hand. When all others were\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Fox Sisters 275\r\nopposed to the ghost's demands, Leah was his ardent friend. As Mrs Pond\r\nobserves\u2014with characteristic moderation\u2014' Leah was alone in her ex- pression of interest.' Lack of sleep had exhausted all the other members\r\nof the family, but Leah was inexhaustible. The cellar was dug up, and the\r\ndiggers unearthed ' a few wisps of reddish hair and two human teeth in a portion of jawbone,' (P. 41). It may be noted here that in 1904 a larger\r\nquantity of bones was unearthed at the house. This cache comprised\r\nvertebrae, rib, arm and leg bones, a shoulder blade, and collar bone. Presumably neither the missing part of the jaw nor any of the skull were found.\r\nQuite soon the knocks began to be heard in the presence of Leah when\r\nher sisters were not in the house. And wherever the family lived, there\r\nthe manifestations were always experienced. For a time the occurrences assumed a poltergeist form (4). Books and wood blocks were thrown,\r\ncold touches were felt, beds and furniture were pulled about. The raps\r\ncontinued. The method of communication by calling the alphabet was\r\ninvented by the brother David. One evening (P. 47), after a day of exceptional disturbances, the spirit knocked out a message which in its sequel\r\nis clearly of great signficance to the Spiritualist movement.\r\nDear Friends, you must proclaim these truths to the world. This is the\r\ndawning of a new era, and you must not try to conceal it any longer.\r\nWhen you do your duty, God will protect you and good spirits will\r\nwatch over you.\r\nThis statement was received in the presence of Leah and Margaret\r\nKate was absent. Thus it came about that the first Spiritualist meeting\r\never held took place in the Corinthian Hall, Rochester, on November 14th,\r\n1848. Four hundred people crowded into the hall to hear the sounds\r\nproduced in the presence of Leah and Margaret. An address was given by\r\none E. W. Capron, the first historian of Spiritualism (4), and a committee\r\nof investigation was appointed. This group reported non-committally.\r\nAnother committee reported in the mediums' favour, and when this was\r\nannounced at a public demonstration the meeting broke up in disorder,\r\nthe mediums being saved by the intervention of the Chief of Police (P. 65).\r\nLeah was now kept extremely busy. She organised more public meetings, and (not less important) arranged seances in private houses. Believers were soon being counted in hundreds and many who came to condemn\r\nremained to cheer. The case of Duncan McNaughton is perhaps not\r\nuntypical of many experiences that have happened in seance rooms in the\r\nsucceeding hundred years. McNaughton, being a Scotsman, had to be\r\neither a Theologian or a Sceptic. Mrs Pond describes him as ' a man of\r\nhigh mental attainments who was an avowed atheist.' To him the raps\r\nspelled out : ' My dear son, hae ye forgotten your puir auld mother? O,\r\nmy son, repeat the Lord's Prayer.' McNaughton ' pushed back his chair\r\nangrily, with a muffled oath.' Nevertheless he responded to the sitters' persuasions and repeated the prayer. Presently he became still more impressed and exclaimed ' Extraordinary! Extraordinary! ' and before the\r\nsitting was over he was ' converted to the truth.' To the reader this may\r\nsound a little ludicrous, but in fact conversions to new religious sects appear to be nearly always rapid.\r\n276 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research SEPT. 1 948\r\nIt was at this sitting that the first payment was made for the services of\r\na medium. On leaving the room, one Wilham Haskall pressed some coins\r\ninto Leah's hand. Leah drew back ' flushed and hurt ' but after some\r\nhasty assurances from the sitters she ' hesitatingly . . . accepted it' (P. 68).\r\nSpiritualism had been launched, and already it had ' become a religion to its followers '. Even so, it could not yet move on of its own volition ; all Leah's zeal and her unflagging energies were needed, and when the\r\ntwo young sisters might have turned back to their village Leah was always\r\nthere to keep their feet moving in the right direction. She made ' rapid\r\nplans ' for extending the good work, her earlier dislike of professionalism was overcome and hereafter the charge for attendance at seances was one\r\ndollar per person.\r\nFrom Rochester they travelled to Troy, then to Albany, and at length\r\narrived in New York on June 4th, 1850. The news of the wonders had\r\nlong preceded the mediums and their mother, they were mobbed by excited\r\ncrowds, the newspapers carried regular nevvs of their demonstrations, and\r\nmost welcome of all they secured the support and personal friendship of\r\nHorace Greeley, the editor of the New York Tribune. Sittings were held\r\nsix hours a day and as a rule all three mediums sat together. Greeley\r\nestimated that ' fully three-fourths of those who had proper opportunities\r\nfor a full investigation ' were convinced that the percussions were not\r\nproduced by the sisters or their mother.\r\nThe success of the movement and their own prosperity seemed unending.\r\nNevertheless, in the course of a few years, two significant changes came\r\nover the scene. First, the theory that the phenomena were caused by\r\nnormal means\r\n\r\ni.e. that the ladies were no more than fraudulent conjurors \u2014instead of dying down with the successful passing of the Rochester\r\n' test ', tended if anything to increase. An early allegation was that the\r\nknocks were due to ' ventriloquism '. A doctor gravely applied a stethoscope to the ladies' chests and found no sign of abnormal breathing or the\r\nproduction of sounds. Another and more serious assertion was that the\r\nnoises were produced by joint-cracking. More will be heard of this presently.\r\nThe second change was simply that in a year or two the Foxes were no\r\nlonger alone in their glory. Rapping mediums sprang up and began to practice all over the occupied regions of the United States. In a few years\r\nit could be said that in New York alone there were one thousand mediums.\r\nIt is not too much to say that had the Fox girls retired from the scene in\r\n1853 (in which year the movement reached and rapidly overflowed Europe)\r\ntheir disappearance would have made no difference to the spread of the new\r\nreligion. Indeed, as early as 1850 a more notable demonstrator was\r\nalready beginning to see visions and hear sounds\u2014D. D. Home, then\r\naged 17 and living with an aunt in Connecticut.\r\nStill, for a time the girls had a monopoly of phenomena for which the\r\ndemand was unlimited, and they were ' the Lions of New York '. Newand more surprising things happened to astonish the inquirers. Automatic writing, spirit lights, spirit hands, levitations were all reported. Onone occasions a table was completely levitated with Governor Talmadge\r\nsitting on top of it. Podmore's judgements on things psychical must be\r\nread with caution and circumspection\u2014for the opinions of one who was at\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Fox Sisters 277\r\nfirst a lively Spiritualist and later a withering sceptic cannot readily be\r\ntaken at their face-value. Nevertheless, his well-known remark about\r\n' naughty little girls ' who amused themselves by mystifying their elders\r\nis not without circumstantial evidence in its support. In the literature\r\nthere are many instances of their capacity for practical joking. On one\r\noccasion when a return visit was paid to the wooden-frame house at Hydesville, the younger girls were mediums for the evening (P. 97). Outside\r\nin the moonlight Leah threw gravel against the wall. No notice was taken.\r\nBecoming bolder Leah threw a stone, and when it passed noisily through\r\na window, old Mrs Fox, within, knew well that this was no spiritual visitation. But she was contradicted by one Aaron Codding\u2014' Mrs Fox, I think you are mistaken. For several minutes before the stone was thrown\r\nthere were little electric explosions near the window. ... A spirit made\r\nthis demonstration.'\r\nThe Aaron Coddings were probably not typical of the Spiritualist\r\nmovement, which, then as now, drew its adherents from every class of the\r\ncommunity. The diplomat Robert Dale Owen, the physicist Cromwell\r\nVarley, Sir William Crookes, and innumerable medical men and lawyers were all convinced by what they witnessed in the presence of one or other\r\nof the Fox sisters. Varley, F.R.S., described the knocks heard by him in\r\nthe presence of Kate as ' a chorus of raps such as fifty hammers all striking\r\nrapidly could hardly produce ' (20).\r\nOn the other side there were doubters who, with increasing voice,\r\nexpressed their suspicion that the knocks were produced by the ladies\r\ncracking their joints\u2014especially the toe and knee joints. An investigation\r\nby three medical professors of Bufl^alo showed that no sounds could be\r\nproduced when the mediums' knee-joints were firmly immobilised. Agroup of Harvard professors also carried out some experiments, but their\r\npromised report was never published (19).\r\nAt a much later time Margaret (Mrs Kane) was investigated by the Seybert Commission (9, 10, 5). The acting chairman of the Commission,\r\nH. H. Furness, described the raps as a\r\n' vibratory sound\u2014tr-rut\u2014tr-rut\r\ntr-rut.' Margaret replied :\r\n' Sometimes they vary. . . . Every rap has a different sound.' She was asked to stand on four inverted tumblers, two\r\nunder each foot. After a long wait some sounds were heard, and\r\nMr Furness, with the 'medium's ' permission, places his hand on\r\none of her feet. The ' Medium ' \u2014' There are the raps now, strong\u2014yes, I hear\r\nthem.'\r\nMr Furness (to the ' Medium ')\u2014' This is the most wonderful thing\r\nof all, Mrs Kane ; I distinctly feel them in your foot. There is not a\r\nparticle of motion in your foot, but there is an unusual pulsation.'\r\nFrederic Myers reviewed this Report, but all that he had to say about\r\nMrs Kane was\u2014' Raps heard close to the medium ; could easily have\r\nbeen produced.' The Commission investigated some other mediums, and\r\nof their report in general Myers said that it should have a powerful effect on Spiritualists ; there were ' several revelations of vulgar, unblushing\r\nfraud, such as must make the ears of honest believers to tingle.' He urged\r\n278 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nSpiritualists to purge their ' faith ' of ' all complicity with this base and\r\ncrawling imposture.'\r\nThe combined mediumship of the Foxes was broken up by their marriages, and from that time Leah could not exert her controlling will to guide the more wayward\u2014and ultimately tragic\u2014impulses of her younger\r\nsisters. Margaret met Dr Elisha Kane, the explorer, in her Philadelphia seance room. He immediately fell in love with her ; from time to time he\r\nexpressed the most scornful scepticism of the mediumship, extracted a promise that she would ' never rap again ', and married her. But in a few\r\nyears he was dead. Margaret thereupon disavowed Spiritualism ' for ever ' (as she then supposed) and was received into the Catholic Church,\r\nof which she was a faithful adherent for several years.\r\nLeah's second marriage\u2014to Calvin Brown\u2014ended with his death two\r\nyears later. She then married a Spiritualist, Daniel Underbill, the\r\nPresident of the New York Fire Insurance Co. Purely as a medium, Leah\r\nis of no great moment. At times she found herself in embarrassing, indeed\r\nalarming, situations. Thus, once at a dark seance in Jersey City, ' lights\r\n'\r\nof dazzling brilliance floated about the room. Suddenly, complaining\r\nthat her hands were burning, the medium fumbled her way across the\r\nroom to a basin of water, but getting no relief hastened from the room to the garden where she plunged her hands into the wet earth. The seance broke up. The sequel was both curious and unexpected. On the following\r\nevening, Mr Simeon Post, having his attention called to ' lights' glowing on the earth, found they were emitted by particles of solid phosphorous.\r\nOn being informed of this discovery the investigating group took at first a\r\nsceptical view of Leah's performances. Happily for the feelings of all concerned they were soon reassured, for Leah at a sitting held under more\r\nrigorous conditions (as the sitters supposed them to be) was able to show\r\nthat the phosphorous was produced by the Spirit beings themselves\r\n' from the atmosphere ' and other sources. To Leah the sitters ofl^ered their abject apologies for ever having doubted her, and (as Mrs Pond\r\nremarks, with a fine sense of the fitness of things), ' Leah held her head high \u2014her eyes bright with the assurance of accomplishment.'\r\nBut of the three sisters it was Kate who was the most notable exponent\r\nof mediumship. Whereas the other sisters retired into the background for\r\nperiods of years, Kate was almost continually in action. She was also the\r\nonly one who was repeatedly investigated by competent psychical re- searchers. On at least one occasion she held a sitting in conjunction with\r\nD. D. Home ; and lastly, there was manifested in her presence almost\r\nevery effect known in mediumistic circles. Automatic writing, mirrorwriting with both hands, direct-writing and drawing (portraits), lights,\r\nlevitations, materializations of hands, heads and complete bodies\u2014all these happened at one time or another in Kate's presence.\r\nOf her American sittings, the most surprising, as well as the most secret, were those with Charles Livermore, a New York banker, who became a\r\nclient of Kate soon after the death of his wife. At the forty-third sitting a figure appeared out of the darkness veiled in gauze. In tense emotion\r\nLivermore claimed to recognize the entity as his wife. She came again\r\nand again at many sittings and one night had the company of ' Benjamin\r\nFranklin '. Livermore and his friend Dr Gray were allowed to cut ofi^ a\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Fox Sisters 279\r\npiece of Franklin's brown coat, but the clipping ' disintegrated and disappeared in their hands '. Livermore had nearly 400 seances with this one medium (11 ; 7 ; P. 263).\r\nBy this time Kate had begun to trace the footsteps of her father, into\r\nalcoholism\u2014as also had Margaret\u2014and in the hope of restoring her health\r\nLivermore sent her on a vist to London with an agreeable companion,\r\nMiss Ogden, as watchdog. For many years her old weakness did not affect her, a transformation that was probably largely due to the happiness of her\r\nmarriage with H. D. Jencken, a barrister who was also a leading Spiritualist. Knocks, bangs, and raps seem to have proclaimed Kate's presence at almost every notable occasion in her career. At her wedding ceremony in\r\nMarylebone Parish Church (December i6th, 1872) raps were heard near\r\nthe altar and in the vestry. At the wedding breakfast held at nearby York\r\nPlace, now part of Baker Street, old Mrs Fox, dead seven years, sent by\r\nraps a message of congratulation, and the heavily laden festive board was\r\n' suspended in mid-air for some seconds '. All this is repeated in the Press\r\nof the day in the most matter-of-fact form, so accustomed had the world\r\nbecome to ' spiritual manifestations '. Some of the accounts read very oddly. When Kate had given birth to her first child the doctor (no Spiritualist) stumbled out of the room and\r\ngulping down two glasses of brandy swore to Jencken that he had heard the\r\nraps, that there were hands besides his own working about the bed, and\r\nthat he had seen a figure leaning over the mother. But how much of this\r\nhas any basis in fact it is quite impossible to say. So far as one's reading\r\ngoes in the vast literature of the Fox sisters, the doctor's name is unknown,\r\nhe seems never to have written any statement on the subject, and the whole\r\nstory seems to rest on Jencken's unsupported testimony.\r\nKate's child Ferdinand was the youngest medium of whom we have any\r\nrecord. At the age of nine days a pencil was put into his hand and (according to his father and mother) he wrote a message from the other world.\r\nBefore he was half a year old he was writing in Greek. One of these messages was reproduced in facsimile (21).\r\nThe importance of Kate's life in London\u2014so far as psychical research\r\nis concerned\u2014rests in the investigations made into her work by three competent observers. Mrs Henry Sidgwick's opinion was negative ; Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes was positive ; Lord Rayleigh spoke rather non-committally but he was evidently disappointed.\r\nCrooke's experiments were conducted some time between 1871 and 1873.\r\nOf ' percussive and allied sounds ' he wrote (12) :\r\nThese sounds . . . are more varied with Mr Home, but for power and\r\ncertainty I have met no one who at all approached Miss Kate Fox.\r\nFor several months I enjoyed almost unlimited opportunity of testing\r\nthe various phenomena occurring in the presence of this lady ... it seems only necessary for her to place her hand on any substance for loud\r\nthuds to be heard in it, like a triple pulsation, sometimes loud enoughto be heard several rooms off. In this manner I have heard them in a\r\nliving tree\u2014on a sheet of glass\u2014on a stretched iron wire\u2014on a stretched\r\nmembrane\u2014a tambourine\u2014on the roof of a cab-\u2014and on the floor of a\r\ntheatre. Moreover, actual contact is not always necessary ; I have had\r\n28o Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nthese sounds proceeding from the floor, walls, etc., when the medium's\r\nhands and feet were held\u2014when she was standing on a chair\u2014when she was suspended on a swing from the ceiling\u2014when she was enclosed in a\r\n: wire cage\u2014and when she had fallen fainting on a sofa. . . . With a full knowledge of the various theories which have been started, chiefly in\r\nAmerica, to explain these sounds, I have tested them in every way that\r\nI could devise, until there has been no escape from the conviction that\r\nthey were true objective occurrences not produced by trickery or mechanical means.\r\nCrookes describes direct writing procured at a dark seance :\r\nI was sitting next to the medium. Miss Fox, the only other persons\r\npresent being my wife and a lady relative, and I was holding the medium's\r\ntwo hands in one of mine, whilst her feet were resting on my feet. Paper was on the table before us, and my disengaged hand was holding a pencil.\r\nA luminous hand came down from the upper part of the room, and after hovering near me for a few seconds, took the pencil from my hand,\r\nrapidly wrote on a sheet of paper, threw the pencil down, and then rose up over our heads, gradually fading into darkness.\r\nOf Kate Fox's automatic writing Crookes wrote :\r\n'\r\nI have been with Miss Fox when she has been writing a message\r\nautomatically to one person present, whilst a message to another person on another subject was being given alphabetically by means of ' raps ', and the whole time she was conversing freely with a third person on a subject totally different from either.\r\nMrs Sidgwick's earliest sittings appear to have been in 1874 soon\r\nafterwards (13) : The most striking seance I had with her was the fourth of a series held\r\nat my own residence, when we obtained a word written on a sheet of our own paper, under the table, in a light which I believe would have been\r\ngood enough to read ordinary print by. We thought that both Mr and\r\nMrs Jencken had their hands above the table, and we could not detect\r\nany movement of their legs. But we were not well placed for observing\r\nthis, as we were continually instructed by the ' spirits ' to lean over the\r\ntable. ... It impressed me a good deal, though even at the time ... we\r\nthought that Mrs Jencken might have written the word with her foot,\r\nand the writing is just of the quality which can be so written without\r\nmuch difflculty.\r\nTen or more years later (13), Mrs Sidgwick had ' ' '\r\n'\r\ntwo short series of sittings with Mrs Jencken ; but again with no conclusive results, except the discovery that she or her ' spirits ' are willing\r\nto claim, as Spiritualistic phenomena, accidental occurrences quite\r\nunconnected with her presence, and that she endeavours, as far as possible, to obtain from oneself the information required to answer one's\r\nquestion. The raps that occur with Mrs Jencken are . . . peculiar\r\nquite unlike what one can produce oneself by rapping with the foot.\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Fox Sisters\r\nThey are loud double knocks, acquiring a special sound from the table,\r\nfloor, door or other object on which they appear to be made . . . they\r\nare distinctly puzzling. . . . [but] no raps occurred when Mrs Jencken\r\nsat with her feet in my lap, nor while she stood on a hassock with her\r\nhand on the door on which the raps were to be made. '\r\n:\r\nChallenged on the point about the ' accidental occurrences ', Mrs Sidgwick\r\nreplied that the seance took place on April 22nd, 1885, at 14 Dean's Yard,\r\nand there were eight persons present besides the medium. Mrs Sidgwick\r\n'\r\nwrote her account eight days after the seance (17) :\r\nSeance at first in the dark . . . two single raps occurred on the drum; which lay on the table. After a time, Mrs Jencken, with Miss B. and - Mr W., withdrew to the door, and while they were there the same rap on \u2022the drum was heard again. The 'spirits' claimed to have produced\r\nthem, but unfortunately we afterwards ascertained that they were caused ;by water dropping from the gas lamp. [The lam.p was one of those in _ -which water was present in the outer tube to prevent escape of gas.]\r\nLord Rayleigh had Mrs Jencken on several visits to his country house,\r\naccompanied by the baby and a nurse and sometimes the husband. Hesaid (15) that ' the results were upon the whole disappointing, and certainly far short of those described by Sir W. Crookes. Nevertheless there was a good deal not easy to explain away '.\r\nThe customary knocks were obtained on a door, by Kate merely placing\r\nher fingers upon it. But\r\nperhaps what struck us most were lights which on one or two occasions\r\nfloated about. They were real enough, but rather difficult to locate,\r\nthough I do not think they were ever more than six or eight feet awayfrom us. Like some of those described by Sir W. Crookes, they mightbe imitated by phosphorous enclosed in cotton wool, but how MrsJencken could manipulate them with her hands and feet held, and it would seem with only her mouth at liberty, is a difficulty.\r\nLord Rayleigh mentions that after writing had once appeared, he arranged\r\npencils and paper inside a large glass retort, of which the neck was then\r\nhermitically sealed.\r\nFor safety this was placed in a wooden box, and stood under the table\r\nduring several seances. . . . Though scribbling appeared on the box,\r\nthere v\\'as nothing inside the retort. Possibly this was too much to expect. I may add that on recently inspecting the retort [1919] I find\r\nthat the opportunity has remained neglected for forty-five years.\r\nLord Rayleigh felt that the incidents and the conditions were not goodenough to establish occult influences ; but yet he had ' always felt diffi- culty in accepting the only alternative explanation '. He added that,\r\nunlike some other mediums he had known, ' Mrs Jencken never tried to divert one's attention, nor did she herself seem, to be observant or watchingfor opportunities. I have often said that on the unfavourable hypothesis\r\nher acting was as wonderful as her conjuring '.\r\nzS^ Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept, i 948\r\nJencken died in 1881, and Kate returned to her native land\u2014and to al- cohol\u2014in 1885. Margaret, too, was only intermittently sober. They\r\nwere in fact slipping steadily down, and their end was squalid. Quarrels\r\nbroke out between them and Leah ; and about the same time ' persons\r\nclosely connected with the organised Spiritualists in New York caused\r\nKate's arrest, charging cruelty and neglect for her children ', (P. 373).\r\nThe action appears to have had Leah's sanction, but it came to nothing.\r\nMargaret had now resorted to drugs in an attempt, probably, to escape\r\nfrom alcohol. She suddenly left New York for London, and from an\r\naddress in Gower Street wrote her notorious letter to a New York newspaper. She characterized Spiritualism as ' a curse ', denounced all and\r\nsundry connected with it, and asserted that the ' rappings ' were the only\r\nphenomena worthy of notice. Returning to New York she demonstrated\r\nto journalists how her raps were produced by joint-cracking (16). Kate was persuaded to give verbal approval to her sister's story ; Margaret\r\ngave lectures and demonstrations in New York and elsewhere, and at one meeting Kate accompanied her on the platform but took no active part in her sister's display. Within a month Kate had recanted (18), and Leah\r\nfollowed suit a year later (P. 405). Forty years had elapsed since they first launched Spiritualism upon the world.\r\nBoth of them were near their end, but Leah in fact was the first to go.\r\nShe fell dead, upbraiding a maidservant. This was on November ist,\r\n1890. Leah was 76 years of age. On July 2nd, 1892, Kate died alone\r\nand apparently in great distress. It was said (19), that during her last illness, when she was apparently quite helpless, the knocks continued to be heard about her room. Margaret died peacefully on March 8th, 1893,\r\nand thus the three founders of Spiritualism passed from the scene within a period of three years.\r\nSomething may now be said, however briefly, of the course of Spiritualism in this country since the foundation of the movement. The date of\r\nthe first formal Spiritualist seance in Britain seems to be quite unknown.\r\nIt may be presumed that the accounts of the strange goings-on in New\r\nYork State reached this country in 1848 or soon afterwards ; and it is not\r\nunlikely that groups of interested people may have ' tried the experiment\r\n\r\nfor themselves.\r\nThe first American medium to set foot in England was Mrs W. R.\r\nHayden, who arrived from Boston in October, 1852. She was the first of\r\na steady stream of American mediums. Their reception was mixed.\r\nThus, on being invited to attend a sitting with D. D. Home, Michael\r\nFaraday asked :\r\n' If the eiTects are miracles, or the work of spirits, does he\r\n[Home] admit the utterly contemptible character, both of them and their\r\nresults, up to the present time, in respect either of yielding information or\r\ninstruction or supplying any force or action of the least value to mankind?'\r\nPodmore has characterised this emotional release as ' a parody of scientific methods '. Another professional scientist. Sir David Brewster, accused\r\nHome of ' insulting religion, common sense, etc., by ascribing his power\r\nto the sacred dead '. The anachronism of Spiritualistic belief lay in the novelty that, whilst\r\nprofessedly a religion, it claimed to be susceptible of scientific proof.\r\nMany people flew into its fold because they believed it had been scientifi-\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Fox Sisters ' 283\r\ncally proved, many others recoiled because they believed the converse.\r\nIf to such considerations there be added humanity's age-old sentiments\r\nconcerning death, it is clear that there was ample opportunity for emotional\r\noutbursts on the part of all sections of the community. The point is well\r\nillustrated by a story told of Myers (perhaps apocryphally). At a dinner\r\ntable he asked a fellow-guest what he thought would happen to him after death. No reply being forthcoming he repeated the question, and got the\r\nresponse :\r\n' Well, I suppose I shall dwell in eternal bliss, but I wish you\r\nwouldn't ask such unpleasant questions.'\r\nMrs Hayden had to endure all the emotional outbursts that were roused ; fortunately for her, some of the feeling was favourable to her practices and\r\nthough she was a medium of feeble powers she appears to have been sincere,\r\nand she made many converts. She remained in the country for only one\r\nyear, and during that time her husband launched the first Spiritualist\r\njournal. The Spirit World. It lasted for only one issue. The first successful Spiritualist paper, The Yorkshire Spiritualist Telegraph, began publication in April 1855. Light, the oldest surviving journal was founded in 1881.\r\nProfessional mediumship was of slower growth in this country than in the\r\nUnited States. In 1869 the American medium Emma Hardinge Britten,\r\nwho lived for many years in England, said that she knew of only two professional mediums in London but in the United States, the mediums\r\n' might be reckoned in thousands '. About the same time, Varley esti- mated the number of mediums in the United Kingdom to be ' not more\r\nthan IDG ' (20).\r\nSpiritualism made its progress in this country (though at a much slower\r\npace than in the United States) by virtue of two factors : (i) The extensive publicity given to such celebrities as Home, Mrs Guppy, the Davenport brothers, Dr Monck, Dr Slade (who had to flee the country), J. J. Morse, and Mrs Britten herself ; and (ii) the initiation of ' home circles ', consisting of groups of people sitting in their own homes for table-tilting,\r\nplanchette (which was invented by a French Spiritualist in 1853), and the\r\nouija board. Even to-day it appears to be common ground amongst\r\nSpiritualists that the main strength of the religion is to be found in the\r\nhome circles. In the first twenty years after 1848 many small societies sprang up for\r\nthe holding of public seances and listening to trance addresses. Some of\r\nthese societies were misnamed ' Psychological Societies ', and a writer of\r\nthe period (23), said that the largest ' spiritual societies ' in the country were the Psychological Society of Edinburgh, the Glasgow Psychological\r\nSociety, the Psychological Society of Liverpool, and the Dalston Association of Enquirers into Spiritualism. Not until 1873 was a national organisation of spiritualists founded. In that year a meeting of local organizations\r\nand of individuals was held in Liverpool for ' a friendly union among\r\nSpiritualists ' (21). ' Fierce attempts,' it was said, ' were made to kill the\r\norganization, especially in the press, but the workers . . . succeeded in planting a central establishment in London.' This society was called The\r\nBritish National Association of Spiritualists. In 1882 the name was\r\nchanged to The Central Association of Spiritualists, and two years later underwent reorganization and was again renamed, becoming The London\r\n284 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nSpiritualist Alliance. Its position in the Spiritualist movement is some\r\nwhat exceptional, for whilst most societies are avowedly church organizations, the L.S.A., ' accepts psychic phenomena not as a new religion but\r\nas the basis of all religions.'\r\nAnother independent society is the Marylebone Spiritualist Association\r\nwhich was founded in 1872 and has a membership of over five thousand.\r\nBefore the Second World War it engaged and regularly filled the Queen's\r\nHall for its Sunday evening meetings.\r\nThere are many other societies which lead independent existences, some\r\nof them reputable, but many others are only curious examples of mediumistic private enterprise. They exist for as long as the medium is popular\r\nand able to provide satisfactory messages.\r\nThe most significant union of Spiritualists in this country is the Spiritualists' National Union which took shape in 1902 out of an earlier federation. The S.N.U. embraces some 500 churches with about 18,500 members. The Union grants certificates to mediums who have satisfied the\r\nExponents Commitee of their ' ability to demonstrate survival of the\r\nhuman spirit after bodily death and show a reasonable knowledge of the\r\nSeven Principles and their implications '. The Seven Principles are a statement of belief to which all members of the S.N.U. adhere. The\r\nPrinciples are :\r\n1. The Fatherhood of God.\r\n2. The Brotherhood of Man.\r\n3. The Communion of Spirits and the Ministry of Angels.\r\n4. The Continuous Existence of the Human Soul.\r\n5. Personal Responsibility.\r\n6. Compensation and Retribution Hereafter for all Good and Evil\r\nDeeds done on Earth.\r\n7. Eternal Progress Open to Every Human Soul.\r\nSir A. Conan Doyle and some other members wished to add an eighth\r\nprinciple, The Leadership of Jesus. Members are free to accept this,\r\nbut it has never been officially adopted. Though no originality is claimed\r\nfor the Principles, their actual wording was received through the mediumship of Mrs Emma Hardinge Britten.\r\nThe Greater World Christian Spiritualist League is almost the only\r\nother large-scale federation. It accepts the leadership and believes in the\r\n' redemptive power ' of Jesus Christ. The League has it own ' spirit\r\nteacher ', a guide who passes under the name of Zodiac and is alleged to be the unnamed scribe who asked Jesus, ' Which is the first commandment of all?' (Mark 12, 28-34).\r\nThe total number of Spiritualists attached to churches and societies in\r\nthis country has been estimated at 50,000 to 100,000. After 100 years ol effort this figure seems surprising in its modesty, representing only one or two\r\npersons in every thousand of the population. To this comment. Spiritualists oflFer the ready reply that the importance and power of their movement\r\nmust not be measured by the numbers of the flock but by the influence of\r\nSpiritualism on contemporary thought and belief. There is no means of\r\nestimating this influence (whatever it may be), but the reader may nevertheless be interested in two questions relative to the problem of post-\r\nSEPT. 1948 The Fox.

Vol. I, ii66pp. ; Vol. II, 1199 pp.\r\n15s. per volume.)\r\nIn 1939 Mr Findlay brought out The Psychic Stream, or The Source and\r\nGrowth of the Christian Faith, a book of about 1200 pages which was\r\nreviewed in the Journal for November-December, 1939. Now, with\r\nvigour unimpaired by the lapse of nine difficult years, and uncurbed by the\r\npaper shortage which has afflicted so many authors, he has brought out a sequel of almost double the length. For the first attempt ' to write world\r\nhistory from the psychic angle of thought ', as the publishers describe the\r\nbook under review, two large volumes may not be excessive, but a reviewer\r\nfor the ^.V.V^. Journal, who cannot indulge a commensurate indifference as\r\nto printing space, is in some difficulty.\r\nThe present reviewer proposes to overcome this by resisting a strong\r\ninclination to summarise and comment on those large portions of the book\r\nwhich deal with aspects of world history having only a slight connection\r\nwith psychic phenomena, or with the beliefs concerning them held by menat different times and places. The reader of these portions of the book,\r\nSEPT. 1948 Reviews 287\r\nhowever much he may dissent from many of the opinions expressed, will hardly fail to recognise that they are the opinions of a man of wide reading\r\nand great experience of practical alTairs, the sincerity of whose ethical\r\npurpose is beyond question.\r\nMr Findlay (Vol. II, p. 965) attributes half the troubles of mankind ' to ignorance of how best to live on earth, to power politics and fanatical\r\nnationalism ', and the other half to what he calls ' superstition '. The\r\nresults of these -two errors cannot always, as the author makes clear, be\r\ndistinguished. For a full statement of the meaning he attaches to ' superstition ' the author, with so much fresh ground to cover, refers the reader\r\nto The Psychic Stream, contenting himself in the later book with a brief\r\nrecapitulation here and there : see e.g. Vol. I, p. 133 and Vol. II, pp.\r\n946-947.\r\nThe particular form of ' superstition ' that Mr Findlay most dislikes is deviation from the simple Spiritualism, which he ardently embraces, in\r\nthe direction of belief in any superhuman order of being. This seems to me a dangerous position for a Spiritualist to assume. If unquestioning\r\nbelief must be accorded to mediumistic declarations purporting to come\r\nfrom men and women now in the ' etheric world ', as to the conditions of\r\nlife and progress there, on what principle can credence be refused to frequent affirmations reaching us through the same channels and ostensibly from the same source that one of the conditions of that life is contact\r\nwith Beings of a higher order than themselves.'' Belief in survival has in the past been closely associated with some form\r\nof theology or philosophy going beyond the bare ethical framework to which Mr Findlay would conhne it, and more particularly with the\r\nMystery Religions which are his pet abomination. Is it not possible that\r\nthe religious doctrines he so violently attacks\u2014perhaps because he is most\r\nfamiliar with them in obsolete definitions\u2014are more effective and natural\r\nallies of survivalism than the ' etheric ' hypothesis, which looks very much\r\nlike an attempt to meet the materialists half-way?\r\nW. H. S.\r\nThe Bishop and the Cobbler. By L. E. Jones. (London: Seeker &Warbourg. 1948. 224 pp. ids. 6d.)\r\nMr Jones is as severe a critic of currently accepted religion and morals\r\nas Mr Findlay, and no less effective a critic because his book is on a smaller\r\nscale and his touch lighter.\r\nThe first chapter, ' Darkest Death,' gives ' grounds, other than faith, for\r\nbelieving that our personalities do in fact survive bodily death '. It is an\r\ningenious parable about a British colonel lost in the remoter parts of Brazil\r\nfor several years, and declared by the President of the Royal Exploration\r\nSociety, in most authoritative style, to be certainly dead. Another explorer,\r\nwho finds him alive but unwilling to return to civilization, reports accordingly, is flatly disbelieved, and returns to Brazil to obtain proof of his\r\nstatements. The Colonel is persuaded to prove his continued existence\r\nand identity by methods of his own devising, methods which, as described\r\nin detail, are a close parallel to the cross-correspondences with which we\r\nall are, or ought to be, familiar. From this Mr Jones proceeds to an acute\r\n288 Journal of The Society for PsycJiical Research sept. 1948\r\ndiscussion of the reasons why various kinds of people are indifferent or\r\nhostile to any examination of the evidence for survival.\r\nAfter several chapters critical not of the essence of religion but. of the\r\nforms in which it has developed, he attempts a constructive answer to the\r\nquestion, what ought conscientious persons dissatisfied with these forms\r\nto teach the young. In his programme he would include the teaching of\r\nsurvival, ' if it [i.e. the evidence for survival] is accepted as, at any rate,\r\nsuggesting the strongest probability\u2014short of strict scientific proof\r\namenable to controlled experiment\u2014that we do in fact survive '. The\r\ntemptation to quote extensively from this stimulating little book is hard to\r\nresist. Mr Jones is an S.P.R. member of many years' standing. It is to be\r\nhoped that he will find other occasions for illuminating discussion of our\r\nsubject. .\r\n; '. '\r\n. , , W. H. S.\r\nAu Diapason du Ciel. By Marcelle de Jouvenel. Introduction by\r\nGabriel Marcel. (Paris : La Colombe ; Editions du Vieux Colombier. 1948. 195 pp.)\r\nM. Gabriel Marcel, who contributes a most valuable Introduction to Mme de Jouvenel's automatic scripts, is well known as an ' existential\r\n'\r\nphilosopher, though there are deep differences between his kind of\r\nExistentialism and the nihilistic brand popularized by M. Sartre. He\r\ngives us at the outset of his Introduction a short explanation of his view of\r\nthe human body, insisting that our usual habit of regarding it as a tool or instrument is mistaken. ' When I consider my body as my tool, I am\r\ngiving way to the kind of unconscious illusion which makes me transfer to the soul the powers of which the body mechanisms are the attributes.\r\nHere I really tend to convert soul into body and enter into an infinite regression.' He invites us to consider the body rather as a medium. When\r\nwe are confronted with telepathic experiences, we are driven to postulate\r\n' sympathetic mediation ', but we should regard all experience as mediated\r\nand the real interest of the ' strange ' facts of extra-sensory perception is the light they may throw on our general experience and on the nature of our psychological make-up. Once we have liberated ourselves from the\r\nillusion of the body-tool destroyed by death, we may hope to begin to conceive an order of being in connection with a\r\n' cosmic consensus '. M. Marcel's personal interest in ultra-normal perceptions was aroused\r\nin 1917, when he joined some friends in experiments with a ouija board.\r\nThe results were a jnixture of evidential information and what seemed to be\r\nimaginative romancing about a young soldier lost in the retreat of the\r\nFrench Army. On a subsequent occasion he obtained, without asking for\r\nit, a clear prediction of future operations on the Italian front, with precise\r\ndetails as to places to be captured and the number of prisoners to be taken\r\nby the Austrians.\r\nThe scripts of Mme de Jouvenel are, as M. Marcel points out, of a very\r\ndifferent kind. They do not yield much evidential material, but he suggests\r\nthat they should be read without that antecedent scepticism which has ' so deplorably paralysed research '. They purport to come from, or perhaps one should say through, Mme de Jouvenel's son, Roland, who died in May 1946, aged fourteen. Mme de Jouvenel had no previous interest in\r\nSEPT. 1948 Reviews 289\r\nanything like automatic writing. She disHked spirituaUsm and occultism.\r\nBut when she was finally persuaded by a persistent friend to try taking a pencil in her hand, she received a clearly written ' message ' almost\r\nimmediately. In addition to her son's assurances of his presence and\r\nsympathy, there were words about something she would be able to do for an American soldier, a friend of Roland's, whom she had tried in vain to\r\ntrace. To her amazemient, the friend called at her house next day. Thus\r\nencouraged, she continued to let her hand write, day by day, and the series\r\npublished here covers about a year.\r\nAlthough there are distinct fragments of precognition and other interesting phenomena to be found in the record, the main interest certainly\r\nlies, as M. Marcel says, in the character and originality of the writings\r\nthemselves. They are, in effect, forcible letters of spiritual direction,\r\nalways inculcating the practices and obediences of orthodox Catholicism,\r\na form of faith to which Mme de Jouvenel was not much inclined to con- form previously. To readers who ask if these teachings are to be taken as\r\ntrue, M. Marcel can, as he says, only give a guarded answer. But in any\r\ncase, the question is not so much one of literal, descriptive truth as of\r\nessential values.\r\nThese values are so evident that M. Marcel is fully justified in his opinion\r\nthat the book poses a delicate question for Catholic readers. The Catholic\r\nChurch is extremely suspicious of anything verging on necromancy.\r\nIsn't there a risk that readers of Au Diapason du Ciel may be led to try their\r\nown hand at communication with the departed? But isn't there also good\r\nreason for Catholic philosophers and theologians to ^yake up and pay\r\nserious attention to the ' strange ' facts studied by psychical research? It is clearly in the hope that some of them may be encouraged to abandon their\r\ndisdain and study the subject with proper attention that M. Marcel has so\r\ndecisively sponsored the publication of this book.\r\nT. B.\r\nThe Journal of Parapsychology, Vol. XII, No. 2, June 1948. (Durham,\r\nNorth Carolina : Duke University Press.)\r\nThe symposium on the next ten years of research continues in this number. Eisenbud suggests psychoanalytic data as a place to look for a possible\r\nuniversal psi effect. Gibson suggests the discovery and investigation of\r\ngifted psi subjects. Hettinger recommends the study of psychometry and\r\nthe training of sensitives. Humphrey looks to study of the personality\r\ncharacteristics of good senders, receivers, and experimenters, and also the\r\ntraining of mediums. Rhine regards more exploratory work as an immediate objective and also looks to the extension of study over methods of\r\nconscious control of psi processes, precognition, and the problem of postmortem survival. Schmeidler also considers personality difli'erences as important and suggests the study of the eifect of brain injuries on psi\r\ncapacities and research with the electro-encephalogram. Thouless proposes increasing the range of problems covered by laboratory work and\r\nimproving the design of experiment. Warcollier considers the problem\r\nof the nature of psychic coupling and the influence of the physical nature of\r\nthe stimulus. Woodruff looks forward to the devising of a repeatable\r\n290 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research sept. 1948\r\nexperiment, and also the study of personality differences in relation to psi\r\nability.\r\nThere is also a report of an important experiment by W. B. Scherer on\r\n' Spontaneity as a Factor in E.S.P.'. He had a mechanical apparatus for\r\nE.S.P. measurement which subjects were free to work at any time during\r\nthe day when they felt a hunch that they could get it right. On comparing\r\nresults obtained under these conditions with those obtained in various\r\ncontrol series under more normal experimental conditions, Scherer found\r\nthat his subjects scored very significantly above chance on the spontaneous\r\nseries whereas the control series yielded nothing significantly above mean\r\nchance expectation. The author concludes that the condition of spontaneity favours the psi process.\r\nThe idea of this experiment is brilliant ; its design is, however, defective. Apparently the control groups were not composed of the same individuals as the experimental group and the significance of the difference\r\nis estimated by comparing the total experimental score with that of the\r\ncontrol groups. This, however, means that a significant difference might\r\nbe due to the fact that the experimental group included one or more psychically gifted subjects while the control groups did not. This possibility\r\ncould have been eliminated in several ways : (i) by using the same subjects\r\nin experimental and control series and comparing not the totals but each\r\nsubject's experimental score with his own control score, (ii) by using the same subjects in experimental and control series and making each perform\r\nan equal number of trials and then comparing the total scores, (iii) by using\r\ndifferent subjects in experimental and control series and comparing, not\r\nthe total scores, but the number of individuals scoring above mean chance\r\nexpectation in the experimental and the control series. The experiment is so good and so important that it is to be hoped that\r\nit will be repeated with a more satisfactory method of assessment of\r\nsignificance. Method no. (iii) could indeed be used by the author with\r\nhis present data. It would only be necessary for him to work out his\r\nresults in a different way.\r\nR. H.

J. West\r\nFrom time to time the Society is called upon by members of the public to investigate supposed hauntings ; but paranormal phenomena are rarely\r\ndiscovered in connection with them, and so reports are not published in the\r\nJournal. This case is unexceptional in failing to provide evidence for the\r\nparanormal, but an account of it may be of interest as an unusually clear\r\nillustration of several of the psychological factors which give these haunting\r\nstories their extraordinarily persistent and recurrent character.\r\nThe names of persons and places have been altered for the purposes of\r\nthis report, but the real names and original statements are, of course,\r\npreserved in the Society's files. In the first instance the place was visited\r\nand the people interviewed by the Research Officer, accompanied by MrJ. F. Nicol, who kindly acted as notetaker. A second visit was paid by\r\nMr Chesters, a member of the Society, and some months later a further\r\ninvestigation was carried out by members of the Manchester Psychical\r\nResearch Institute. The conclusions of all these investigators were\r\nsubstantially the same. In particular, all were agreed that the phenomena\r\nwere not due to any supernormal cause, but that neither were they produced by deliberate fraud. The people who experienced the haunting were obviously suffering from its effects. They seemed genuinely\r\nfrightened and anxious to be rid of it.\r\nThe case opened on the evening of January 28th, 1948, when Mrs\r\nBrown and Mr Poole called upon the Research Officer to seek advice.\r\nThey were respectively proprietress and manager of a dance hall in Ashton\r\n(a town in the north of England) which was losing money on account of\r\nwhat they believed to be a haunt. Mrs Bro%vn, and a partner of hers, MrOwen, had bought the business in April 1947 from a man who also owned\r\nsome cinemas. It seemed to them a promising concern, and some policemen whom Mrs Brown consulted told her that there was no reason why the\r\nplace should not pay well. Ever since Mrs Brown took over there had been a long chain of mishaps.\r\nThe microphone, the amplifier, the lights, the geyser, the electric clock,\r\nin fact every bit of the installation that could possibly break down was\r\ndoing so repeatedly, and for no apparent reason. Things were continually\r\ngetting lost or broken. The doors had holes in them where the plywood\r\npanels had been stove in with heavy blows. Several chairs and tables had\r\nbeen smashed. Money and small articles were always disappearing. Two\r\ntickets for a police ball were taken from the pocket of Mr Poole's coat as it hung in the office. On one occasion Mrs Brown and her partner, MrOwen, both counted some money and put it in a sealed envelope in the till. When Mrs Brown opened the envelope, which was still sealed, a pound was\r\nmissing. Money was even taken from boys who had volunteered to help\r\nin the cloakroom. A young man called Bob, who had worked for Mrs\r\nBrown a long time and never been known to steal anything, ran away\r\nwithout explanation, taking seven pounds with him. It was as if there were a hoodoo on the place and nothing would go right.\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1948 The ' Haunted ' Dance Hall 295For a long time Mrs Brown never supposed her troubles were anythingmore than an extraordinar}^' run of bad luck due to normal causes. Sometimes she thought there might be someone trying to sabotage the undertaking. About a month after they arrived, however, an accident happenedwhich set Mrs Brown thinking. The lights of the main hall had shadeswhich each contained five glass panels. During a dance one evening, oneof these glass panels fell down and nearly hit four dancers who were passingunderneath. She got the firm who had fixed the lights to remove all the\r\nother glass panels. The workmen expressed surprise, because all the other\r\npanels were firmly fixed and could not possibly fall. Mr Poole said theyhad told him there must be a saboteur at work, as the glass panel could no't possibly have fallen unless it had been tampered with. This was impossible, as the shade could not have been interfered with unless it hadbeen lowered to the ground, and there was no opportunity for anyone to do that. ^ ^\r\nIn May 1947 a more serious accident happened. Part of the ceiling of\r\nthe dance hall is made of glass, and above it is a loft. During a dance the\r\nceiling began to leak, and Mr Poole, the manager, and Mr Owen went upmto the loft to put it right. Mr Poole accidentally stepped on to one of the\r\nglass panels in the roof and fell through. He managed to grasp one of the\r\nbeams and held on swinging for some minutes until Mr Roberts and other\r\nmembers of the band got up to the loft and hauled him back again. MrPoole said he was sitting regaining his breath when Mr Owen recrossed\r\nthe roof in order to come down. He, too, stepped on the glass, fell right\r\nthrough on to the dance floor and hurt himself badly. He was conscious,\r\nbut had to be carried off\" to hospital where he stayed twenty weeks. His\r\npelvis was fractured, his right arm broken and he had failed to recover the use of his right hand. Mrs Brown was very shocked by this accident. ' I never thought of the supernatural at the time,' she said, ' the horror of\r\nthe accident was so great. We took him to the hospital and gave the\r\npeople back their money.'\r\nAt this stage Mrs Brown asked Mr Poole if he thought there were something very queer going on. Mr Poole then confided that he thought the\r\nplace was haunted. Mrs Brown had always returned home to sleep, but for\r\nthe first five weeks Mr Poole slept in the hall, although he had lodgings in\r\nthe town. He said he did this because he felt sure there was something\r\ngomg on. He expected to catch someone breaking in, but he never did.\r\nAfter a week or two he realised that the happenings were supernatural. At\r\nfirst Mrs Brozvn laughed at him and told him not to be silly, but Mr Poole\r\nstuck to the idea. He said he was not a man to be frightened of nothing. He had served in the Forces for six years during the war, in Iceland, Burmaand elsewhere. He was thirty years of age, and had been a wrestler.\r\nThe experiences which Mr Poole related to Mrs Brown and repeated for our benefit were of several kinds. First there were noises. He slept in a\r\nlittle cubby-hole known as the band-room, underneath the balcony.\r\nPractically every night he was kept awake from about i a.m. until 5 by\r\nmexplicable sounds, as of doors banging, footsteps walking across the hall or on the balcony above him. The place was always locked up, and whenhe shone a torch there was never anyone there.\r\nSecond, there were apparent physical movements. The band-room was\r\n296, Journal of The Society for Psychical Research oct.-nov. 1948\r\nfitted up as a cloakroom, with a gap in one wall which could be closed by\r\na detachable shutter clipped in place with wing-nuts. One night he\r\nput this shutter up as usual, but was disturbed at about 2.30 a.m. by a\r\nslight noise. Switching on a torch and pointing it in the direction of the\r\nnoise, he was just in time to see the w(3oden shutter coming to rest slowly on the floor into a position propped up against the wall beneath the gap, as\r\nif it had been detached and placed there by an invisible hand. On another\r\noccasion Mr Poole was walking in the dark down the stairs to the cloak- room. At the head of the stairs was a door kept shut by a spring. He\r\nwalked through this doorway unthinkingly, and as he was passing he felt the pressure of the door swinging back to close after him. Then he realised\r\nthat he had not pushed the door open at all. It must have been pushed\r\nopen for him as he approached. He fled. Lastly, there were the faces which could be seen when he looked through\r\nthe gaps in the ceiling to the loft above. The faces were often there but\r\nhe did not recognise them. One particular face looked like a judge, his\r\nhand shaking as if remonstrating, and surrounded by a crowd of people.\r\nMr Poole also said there were queer faces in the mirrors in the hall, and\r\nthere was a horrible atmosphere about the place which he could feel. Mrs Brown said that when she heard all these stories of Mr Poole's she was inclined to scoff, but she decided to stay in the place with him one\r\nnight to see if she could experience anything herself. She brought with\r\nher a friend, Mrs Field, a lady who had at times helped with the work at the dance hall. They heard nothing unusual and fell asleep. Mrs Field was awakened by a noise like someone treading a machine, and she saw a\r\nlight go on in the main hall. In the morning Mrs Brown, who had heard\r\nnothing, made light of the whole affair, but when she went out into the\r\nmain hall she had a shock. A crucifix appeared in the wall. She called out\r\n' Oh glory be! Look at that '. Mr Poole and Mrs Field both came to her\r\nand both of them saw the crucifix. Mr Poole cried out, ' That's nothing,\r\nthere's another one ', and they all saw a second cross. Gradually the\r\ncrosses faded away before their eyes. This experience convinced Mrs\r\nBrown that the place was haunted. After that both she and Mrs Field did\r\nsee from time to time the faces in the shadows of the rafters just as Mr\r\nPoole had described them. Matters went from bad to worse. The mishaps continued. People stopped coming and the business lost money.\r\nMrs Field and Mrs Brown both felt oppressed by a malignant atmosphere.\r\nMr Poole said he tried in vain to fight against the evil influence which\r\nseemed to pervade the place.\r\nThis, in outline, was the story told to the investigators. The first task was to see if corroboration could be found for the idea that the hall was\r\nhaunted. Mrs Brown was asked if any other people believed in the ghost.\r\nShe said that for fear of an adverse effect upon the business they had\r\navoided discussing the matter with outsiders, but they had reason to believe other people knew about it. At one time the hall had been used as\r\na religious meeting place, and she supposed it possible that spirits who\r\nhad associations with it at that time might disapprove of its use for dancing.\r\nA Mrs Southern (i), who lived at a neighbouring inn, had remarked to Mrs Brown that the place was haunted. The bandsman, Mr Jack\r\nOCT -NOV. 1948 The 'Haunted' Dance Hall 297\r\nRoberts (2) had remarked to Mr Poole that there was ' something ' in the\r\nloft. He subsequently ceased coming to play there, and Mrs Brozvfi supposed it was because he did not like the awful atmosphere of the place.\r\nShe made enquiries and found that there had been four changes of ow'nership in the last five years. No one could stick it. Miss Dale (3), secretary' to the former ov. ner, said that when her brother-in-law, who w^as manager,\r\nslept in the place, he and his wife heard footsteps at night. A young girl\r\nwho came frequently to the dances, known to them only by the name\r\nMargaret (4), ran up to Mr Poole in fear one night, saying she had seen an\r\napparition on the piano and the hall must be haunted.\r\nAt one stage Mr Poole, at Mrs Brozcns suggestion, sought the aid of a Catholic priest (5), asking him to come and bless the building. At first the priest was disinclined to do so, but after consulting the canon, he came. Mr Poole said that Bob (6) (the boy who had run away with the money)\r\nhad stayed one night with him in the hall, but was so frightened by\r\nghostly noises that he ran away and wouldn't come again.\r\nHere, then, was quite an array of witnesses, but when they were consulted by the investigators, a very different picture came to light.\r\n(1) Miss Southern, asked if she thought the place was haunted, said 'Yes'.\r\nAsked her reasons, she said she didn't really know, she just felt it ; she\r\nsupposed she must be psychic.\r\n(2) Mr Jack Roberts did not reply to a letter of enquiry', but his mother\r\nwas inter\\\"iewed. She stated that his reason for ceasing to attend at the\r\nhall was that it was bad policy for a bandsman to play when there was a poor attendance. She remarked that he used to bring his things home\r\neach night because nothing was safe in the hall on account of the petty\r\npilfering and sabotage that was always going on.\r\n(3) Miss Dale, in a letter to the Research Officer, wTOte :\r\n' Your information regarding my noticing any unusual occurrences at the Dance\r\nHall is entirely incorrect and my sister and brother-in-law, Mr and Mrs\r\n, also state that they have never seen or heard anything out of the\r\nordinar}' during their sojourn there.'\r\n(4) The opportunity for the investigators to question the girl Margaret\r\ndid not arise, but later Mrs Brown spoke to her and reported to us that she\r\ndenied seeing any apparition.\r\n(5) The Catholic priest and the canon both denied all knowledge of the\r\nhall having been blessed at all. However, a cloakroom attendant at the\r\nhall stated that one morning he entered the hall to find a priest blessing the\r\nplace. Mrs Brozun was present. This testim^ony conflicts with both that\r\nof the priest, who denied that there had been any blessing, and with that\r\nof Mrs Brown who stated that she was not present when the blessing took\r\nplace.\r\n(6) Boh, who was said to be so terrified by the ghostly noises, maintained on being questioned that he had neither seen nor heard anything, but he\r\ndid not like the atmosphere and would not care to staj- in the place alone.\r\nDuring the night he spent there with Mr Poole, he heard only odd creaks,\r\nand no footsteps.\r\nAmong the persons questioned were the following :\r\n(7) Mr Thompson, caretaker at the hall, an ex-regular soldier, stated that\r\nhe had noted nothing unusual except that on one occasion whilst he was\r\n298 Joimial of The Society for Psychical Research oct.-nov. 1948\r\ntending the fire for the central heating, he heard three or four unexplained\r\nfootsteps.\r\n(8) Mr Owen, Mrs Brown's partner, declined to make any statement.\r\nIt seemed that his relatives disapproved of his connection with the dance\r\nhall, which they considered an unsound proposition.\r\n(9) The local police and the editor of the local paper were consulted.\r\nThey were familiar with the history of the hall, but knew of no tradition of\r\nhaunting. The place had been built as a school, later it was used as a chapel. It had been empty for ten years, then became a billiard hall and\r\nfinally, five years ago, it came to be used as a dance hall, but it was structurally unsuited, and there was a much better, more modern dance hall nearby. In their opinion the dance business there was something of a white elephant, and had only paid during the war when the district was crowded with American troops. There was therefore ample reason for\r\nthe frequent changes of ownership.\r\nThe hall itself, when inspected by the investigators, proved to be an old,\r\ndull-looking brick building, from the outside more like a store-house than\r\na place of entertainment. The building was badly in need of repair.\r\nInside, although recent attempts had been made to improve the internal\r\ndecorations, there were signs of damp, and the general effect was somewhat\r\ndismal.\r\nThere was every opportunity for mysterious creaks and noises. The\r\nnight the Research Officer spent in the hall, in addition to the usual creakings of the wooden dance fioor, rattlings of the doors and whistling of the\r\nwind through the rafters, there Vv'as a queer rhythmic sound v\/hich put the\r\nwatchers on the alert. It was traced to a dripping water cistern.\r\nA few months after she first reported the case, Mrs Brozvn sold the\r\nbusiness. During some renovations following the change of ownership,\r\na disused sewer was discovered running under the building (close to where\r\nMr Poole used to sleep) which was quite a runway for rats. The new\r\nproprietor, who runs a chain of dance halls, had with his experience and\r\ncapital been able to increase staff and improve the building, so that the\r\nbusiness is now doing much better. Nothing ghostly has happened since\r\nhe took it over.\r\nClearly the case depended entirely upon the three persons most closely\r\nconcerned with the hall, Mr Poole, Mrs Brown and Mrs Field. No one\r\nelse could be found who was willing to bear out the theory that the place was haunted. The categorical denials by Mr Roberts, Miss Dale, Bob, and\r\nMargaret might suggest that the main characters in the case were deliberately lying in their accounts of the experiences of the other people concerned. If so, it was probably because they were anxious to convey to the\r\ninvestigators their conviction of the reality of their own experiences, rather\r\nthan because they wanted to put over a story which they themselves did not\r\nbelieve.\r\nIf there was nothing unusual about the dance hall, it remains to be\r\nexplained why three persons, Mr Poole, Mrs Brown and Mrs Field should\r\nall have had visionary experiences of ghostly faces and the like. Some clue\r\nmay be had from a consideration of the people concerned.\r\nFirst, there is Mr Poole, who might be called the chief agent in the case.\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1948 The ' Haunted' Dance Hall 299\r\nHe it was who began the story of the haunt and persisted with it in the face\r\nof ridicule until the two ladies also became convinced. Mr Poole was in his thirties, shortish, but heavily-built, with strong-looking limbs and a thick-set countenance, fitting in weir with his description of himself as a wrestler. His eyes gleamed out of extraordinarily narrow slits, adding a sinister touch to an otherwise ungainly appearance.\r\nPsychologically there was something odd about Mr Poole. He did not\r\nstrike me as being a well-developed, integrated personality. On close\r\nquestioning he admitted to a belief in his own psychic powers, particularly\r\nin respect of prem_onitions. When, at the Research Officer's suggestion,\r\nhe saw a psychologist in London, he described how he got infallibly correct\r\n' hunches '. The psychologist held some fingers behind his back and\r\nasked Mr Poole to wait for one of his ' hunches ' and then say how manyfingers were being held out. Although Mr Poole was confident of his success, and the experiment was repeated ad lib, only chance results were\r\nobtained. According to Mrs Brozm and Mrs Field,'Mv Poole sometimes\r\nwent into ' trances ' and spoke strangely. One night he arrived at MrsBrown's very pale and shaken, saying that the thing from the dance hall had\r\nfollowed him home. Mr Poole was unmarried, and Mrs Brown remarked\r\nthat he was ' very young in things like that '. He seemed rather dependent\r\nupon Mrs Brown both psychologically and materially. She had befriended him, given him the job at the dance hall, and even taken him into\r\nher house for a time. It must have been an acute disappointment to himthat he had not been able to justify her trust by m.aking the dance hall venture a success, and it was probably a great relief to Mr Poole to be able to attribute the failure to external supernormal causes. Thus we have the first requirement for a\r\n' haunt ' of this nature, an\r\nindividual subject to dissociation, who can gain some relief from inner\r\nconflict by means of an hysterical projection of ghostly visions which serve\r\nto excuse his own failure. For a long timic the ' phenomena ' were convincing to none but himself, but such was the conjunction of external\r\ncircumstances that Mrs Brown eventually succumbed and attributed to the\r\n'hat outsiders could see was a series of misfortunes caused by lack\r\nof business acumen, staffing inefficiency, petty pilfering, and sabotage.\r\nMrs Brozvn was a slim, well-preserved lady, older than Mr Poole. She\r\nis separated from her husband, who was an alcoholic. She ran a hairdressing business, and took on the dance hall as a side line. She asserted\r\nso often and so volubly that she was an experienced business organiser\r\nthat one felt she was trying to convince herself that the failure of the dance\r\nhall was not due to incompetence. Both Mrs Brown and Mrs Field were\r\nsuggestible people, and once an hallucinatory- experience had been precipitated, others followed readily. Shadows on the walls and in the rafters formed the basis of most of the ' faces ' seen. Mr Poole, Mrs Brozvn and Mrs Field on being questioned asserted that\r\nwhen they saw faces, they all saw the same faces. In the case of MrsBrown and Mr Poole, who saw faces in the rafters when the Research Officer was present, this claim was disproved. When they both together gazed at the same spot in silence, and afterwards were questioned separately as to Avhat they had seen, their descriptions did not tally. Mr Chesters found\r\nthat by giving her a suitable lead he could make Mrs Brown see faces.\r\n3\u00b0\u00b0 \u2022 - Journal of The Societyfor Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1948\r\nwherever he suggested. The psychologist who later saw Mrs Brown and\r\nMr Poole performed a similar experiment, taking them into an almost dark\r\nroom in which he said people had seen ghostly visions. They responded\r\nappropriately by seeing lights and faces, although in fact, so far as was known, no one had ever seen anything in the room before.\r\nMrs Field's visions were rather different. She was suffering from a bereavement, and kept seeing the face of her dead son. These experiences were painful for her, so the investigators did not in her case pry too closely or see whether visions could be induced by suggestion.\r\nMr Poole, Mrs Brown, and Mrs Field all said they had not experienced\r\nanything like hallucinations or visions prior to coming to the dance hall. If correct, this shows how easily hallucinations can be induced in normal\r\npersons by a sufficiently suggestible atmosphere. It must be noted, however, that in this case the hallucinations were mainly built up from light\r\nand shade effects on the walls and rafters, much as figures may be seen in\r\nink-blots, or faces in crystals. This dependence upon points de repere\r\nindicates a more rudimentary form of projection than if the apparitions\r\nhad been seen to move about realistically among their surroundings.\r\nThus we have, besides an active agent, the second important factor in\r\nthe genesis of the haunt ; persons susceptible to hallucinations and suitably\r\nsuggestible. The third factor, external circumstances (in this case a string\r\nof mishaps), served to confirm the idea of the haunt. Finally, the whole\r\naffair was probably perpetrated by the unconscious motive of all con- cerned to find some scapegoat for the failure of the business.\r\nPRECOGNITIVE DREAMS AND THE DUNNE EXPERIMENT\r\nIn a letter to the Research Officer, dated August 8th, 1948, Mr J. C. M.\r\nKruisinga, of Vriezenveen, Holland, wrote as follows : On p. 269 of your most interesting paper ' The Investigation of\r\nSpontaneous Cases ' {Proceedings, Vol. XLVIII, Part 175) you suggest\r\nthat the Dunne experiment is not repeatable, as no successes have been\r\npublished since the 1933 trial.\r\nI am sorry to say you are not altogether right in surmising that\r\nnothing has been published concerning precognitive dreams. In\r\nHolland two complete series of dream records, each covering about\r\nthree years, have been submitted to statistical analysis, the results of\r\nwhich have been duly published in the Tijdschrift voor Parapsychologie,\r\nthe Dutch S.P.R. bi-monthly. One of these series, consisting of 1444\r\nrecords, has further been checked against pure coincidence. As a matter of fact it was my own, as well as the control series I used for my\r\nchecking. Dr Kooy of Delft University and I had a lot of trouble about\r\nstandardising both ' mixed ' and pure chance influences, and fencing in\r\nchance results, but we got through all right, I think.\r\nI have summarised my own concluding paper on the Dunne effect {Tijdschrift voor Parapsychologie, XII, pp. 213-228) as follows :\r\nDunne Effect or Coincidence.? (Summary in English)\r\nEarlier in this paper (Vol XI, pp. 173-182) I have commented upon a\r\nseries of dream records I completed by March 1937, and indicated a\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1948 Precognitive Dreams 301\r\nmethod to check its apparent results against those afforded by pure\r\nchance. In the experimental series the number of F-resemblances\r\n(cf. J. W. Dunne, An Experiment with Time, 3rd Edition, p. 256) within\r\nthe scheduled time interval of ninety days totalled 62 in 1444 recorded\r\ndream situations. It has been found impossible, not only to show\r\ndegrees of resemblance graphically, but even to discern between ' good ' and ' moderate ' cases objectively. I spent several months in trying to obtain estimates of the probability factors for every combining element,\r\nbut the obstacles proved insurmountable, and I have made no reference\r\nto these fruitless attempts in my report.\r\nA control series during which I have kept every resemblance carefully\r\noutside the time limit has yielded far better results in determining\r\nchance influences. Working with my original fourteen hundred or so dream records, and comparing them with real incidents occurring\r\nwithin a go days interval postponed until three years later, I found in\r\nthe first place that the total number of F-resemblances (of which not a single one now could have a right to be called a Dunne effect) was\r\nconsiderably less. During the control series F-resemblances totalled 17, thus comparing\r\nmost unfavourably with the 62 contained in the experimental one. Secondly, the difference in character of both kinds of phenomenawas sufficiently demonstrated by having the Dunne effect cases controlled in this way by a standard series, in which pure chance only can be held responsible for resemblances.\r\nMr Kruisinga enclosed two histographs showing the frequency of\r\n' resemblances ' plotted against the time interval between the recording\r\nof the dream and the occurrence of the ' resemblance '. In the diagram\r\nillustrating pure chance there was a more or less uniform incidence in the\r\nchance resemblances, which were spread out in a straggling line along the\r\naxis. In the diagram of the results of pure chance plus Dunne effect, there was a great piling up of resemblances over the short period immediately\r\nfollowing the dream.\r\nThe Research Officer replied thanking Mr Kruisinga for drawing\r\nattention to the serious omission from his paper of any mention of the\r\nDutch experiments in precognitive dreams. He pointed out that there was what seemed to him an insuperable difliculty in the assessm.ent of\r\ndream records, in so far as they purport to foretell the dreamer's ownfuture experiences, namely, that only he is in a position to note the\r\ncorrespondences. The consequence is that it impossible for the\r\ndreamer to avoid knowing when he is scoring ' control ' dreams, and such\r\nknowledge may influence his scoring.\r\nRecent experiments in the scoring of mediumistic utterances have\r\nshown how difficult it is, when the scorer knows which are ' controls\r\n' and which are actual items, to secure an impartial annotation free from\r\nsubjective bias. In reply Mr Kruisinga wrote as follows :\r\nI too have alluded in my publications to the difficulty you mentioned\r\nin your letter, viz. the subjective factor in assessing the ' control ' and\r\n' experimental ' correspondences. However, I have always regarded\r\n302 Jouinal of The Society for Psychical Research oct.-nov. i 948\r\nthe sifting of my material for correspondences as a kind of sport, and\r\naccording to my own conviction\u2014have never made any differences\r\nbetween hunting for chance correspondences in the control series and\r\npicking (hypothetically) paranormal ones from the experimental records.\r\nIn other words, I remember having always been as enthusiastic over a good chance congruency as over a plausible ' Q.E.D.' effect. I have\r\ntried to illustrate my attitude towards precognitive dreams by saying\r\nthat there are no better gamekeepers than ex-poachers. Having felt like a poacher during the experiment, I felt a certain satisfaction in acting\r\nas a gamekeeper while controlling my former unorthodox results. I fully agree with you that I may be all wrong in my imagination, as of course my conviction of having weighed results impartially also comes\r\nunder the heading ' subjective '. But letting that pass, I was rather\r\npleased indeed to have found a method at least partly useful in checking\r\nthe otherwise much flattered results of an entirely uncontrolled dream\r\nexperiment.\r\nI may state\u2014but of course you can only take my word for it\u2014that I took up the experiment in a very sceptical state of mind, and even now\r\nI am vaguely unconvinced. If the quantitative method, however, is going to yield irrefutable proof of precognition, the Dutch dream\r\nexperiment may be of some value as independent and corroborative\r\nevidence.\r\nYou were quite right in writing there is no way out of the difficulty,\r\nand so in dream experiments we shall have to take it into the bargain.\r\nMr G. F. Dalton, a member of the Society, has since reported the results\r\nof another attempted repetition of the Dunne experiment. The conditions were informal, the experiments being intended as an exploratory or pilot\r\noperation which other investigators could follow up with more rigorous\r\nmethods. The results were very sim.ilar to those obtained by Mr Kruisinga.\r\nThe dream records were re-read every day for forty days following the\r\ndream, and all resemblances to actual events were noted. Mr Dalton\r\nfound that most of the resemblances occurred in the first three days, the\r\nfrequency thereafter dropping steeply to a more or less constant chance\r\nlevel.\r\nEDITOR'S NOTES\r\nThese Notes, which are a new feature of the Journal, are mainly intended\r\nto provide a channel through which members may be informed of matters\r\nwhich would not otherwise find a place in its columns. They will include\r\nsuch items as short accounts of cases which, though of interest, are not\r\nsuitable for reporting in full ; points from letters ; news of the activities of other societies concerned with psychical research ; accounts of research\r\nwork in progress ; and comments on published reports and matters of\r\ngeneral interest which may be helpful to new and less experienced\r\nmembers. Above all, it is hoped that they may in some measure serve to bring members into closer relation with each other and with the officers of the Society.\r\nOCT.-Nov. 1. iMuv. 1948 ly^o Editor's t^aiior s Notes r^otes ^03It must be emphasised that opinions expressed in these Notes are notbe taken as those of the Council, but are the responsibiHty of the Editortoalone.\r\nA frequent subject of discussion to-day is the apparent decrease in the\r\nnumber of cases which give grounds for assuming a paranormal cause. Some people are of the opinion that the decrease is more apparent thanreal, and that experiences of a psychic nature are no less com.mon to-daythan m the early days of the Society. It is held that the increasingly wideacceptance of psychical phenomena in general has led those experiencingthem to assume that they are of smaller interest, with the result that theyare less often reported. A different view is that many claims cannot nowstand up to sharpened criticism and the improved technique of investigation. This is to some extent true of certain spontaneous experiences. Thedevelopment of psychiatry and the patient work of psychical researchers\r\nhave shown that cases having outwardly all the features associated with a genumely paranormal occurrence are often due to psychological, as\r\ndistinct from psychic, causes. Cases which frequently come into 'this categoi-y are those having the characteristics of poltergeist activity ; and' hauntmgs ', often of a persistent nature, centering in the early stages round a single individual. The case reported by Dr West in this issue is a good example of the ' psychological haunt '. As one often finds in a case of this type, the occurrences centred round a person ' subject to dissociation, who can gain some relief from inner conflict by means of an hysterical\r\nprojection of ghostly visions '\r\n; and the case involved two other peoplesufficiently suggestible to give currency, in all good faith, to supposedparanormal happenings.\r\nThe Society receives reports of a considerable number of cases of this kind, and they are often of great interest, not only from a psychological\r\npoint of view, but also because they illustrate how easily they could, on a superficial examination, be mistaken for genuinely paranormal cases' Tothose members who would like to see them reported more frequently, it should be said that such cases often involve information of so intimate a nature that those concerned are not prepared to allow publication of the\r\nfull facts essential to their understanding.\r\nIt is one of the achievements of psychical research to have rendered\r\nthis type of case more easily identifiable, and so to have narrowed the field for a closer study of the residuum of paranormal phenomena.\r\n# * #\r\nThe B.B.C. continues to include in its programmes features dealing with\r\nwhat IS commonly described as ' the supernatural '. Some two years ago\r\nthere was the series of broadcasts on haunted houses under the title of\r\n' Do You Believe in Ghosts.? ', and later an ' outside ' broadcast from the\r\nsite of Borley Rectory\u2014an affair which, incidentally, let loose on the\r\ninhabitants of the one remaining building so many sightseers that they began to regret their choice of habitation. More recently, and of greater\r\ninterest to those concerned with psychical research, were Dr Dingwall's\r\ntalk on ' Eminent Victorians and the Spirit World ' in the series ' Ideas\r\nand Beliefs of the Victorians '\r\n; a survey of the history and applications\r\n304 Journal of The Society for Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1948\r\nof hypnotism ; and an examination by Stuart Hampshire of the philosophical implications of Dr J. B. Rhine's latest work, The Reach of the\r\nMind.\r\nBroadcasts describing experiences of a supposed psychic nature have\r\nlately been given by Algernon Blackwood (' Oddities ') and by Charles\r\nGrosse (' African Haunts '). The latter gave an account of two striking\r\nexperiences which happened to him in Southern Rhodesia when he was in the British South African Police. The first story told by Mr Grosse (who\r\nhas kindly shown his script to the Research Officer) described how he was\r\nthe target for a shower of stones, averaging in size that of a coconut,\r\ncoming from a direction where, according to his observation, there was no human being and where no one could have been concealed. Unfortunately, there was no witness of this occurrence (except an aged African\r\nwitch-doctor standing close to Mr Grosse while the stones were being\r\nthrown) and (a point which was not mentioned in the broadcast) the event was not set down in detail until nearly thirty years after its occurrence. Mr Grosse's second story, which also involved activities of a poltergeist\r\nnature, mentions at least two witnesses, and efforts are being made to communicate with them.\r\n# * *\r\n'\r\nWhen the performance of a stage ' mind-reader ' using conjuring methods\r\nto produce his effects is presented to the public as though it were a genuine\r\nexample of telepathy, a disservice is done to psychical research, even though\r\nthe performer himself may make no specific claim to psychic powers. A\r\nlarge proportion of those who heard the brilliant ' mind-reading ' performance of Mr Maurice Fogel broadcast by the B.B.C. at 10.15 P-iri- on December 6th, and who read the impressive account in the News Clironicle\r\nof December 8th of the ' test ' carried out in that newspaper's offices,\r\ncannot fail to have concluded, from the manner in which these performances were described, that those present were convinced that genuine psychic\r\npowers were involved. It is food for thought that many of the millions who\r\nheard or read these descriptions must have received the impression that\r\ntelepathic faculties exist in a very advanced state and can be brought into\r\nplay at will. Several members of the Society have expressed concern about the manner\r\nin which these performances were presented. They may be interested to know that Mr Fogel made the following statement to the Editor of this\r\nJournal on December nth :\r\n' I do not lay claim to supernormal powers, nor do I wish to be called a\r\n- \" telepathist \". I have my own method of\" reading people's thoughts \" '.\r\n^ ^\r\nIn a private Society whose financial resources are limited and whose raw\r\nmaterial, the individual gifted with psychic powers, appears to be so rare, much depends on the efforts of the members themselves. Though the\r\nmembership is larger than it has been for many years, and is still increasing,\r\nthere is little news of experimental work carried out by individual members.\r\nFew of us to-day have sufficient leisure to devote to lengthy and exacting re- search projects, but there is a way in which members can be of great\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1948 Editor s Notes 305\r\nservice : namely, by helping to locate promising subjects. They can do\r\nthis, as Mr Denys Parsons and Dr West suggested in their recent lectures,\r\nvisiting by mediums and fortune-tellers, however obscure, by carrying out\r\nsimple E.S.P. experiments,^ and by putting the Society's officers in touch\r\nwith anyone who they have grounds for believing has faculties deserving\r\ninvestigation. Those who have the necessary equipment and technical\r\nknowledge would then be able to concentrate on the in\\estigation of\r\nsubjects who have already shown signs of special ability.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nThe Psi Processes\r\nSir, \u2014In his criticism (June-July Journal) of our Shin paper, Mr Basil\r\nSmith says that the known facts of physiology make the hypothesis of the\r\nseparateness of mind and body untenable, that the fact of destruction of\r\nmind through brain injury indicates that mind and brain are identical,\r\nand that the idea of Shin control of growth has been disproved for ever by\r\nDr Needham's Biochemistry and Morphogenesis which proves that growth\r\nis the work of hormones.\r\nHe is, of course, expressing the orthodox physiological view based on\r\nfacts other than those considered by psychical research. ' We know' that\r\nview and we know the facts on which it is based. Our contention was\r\nsimply that psychical research reveals other facts w^hich require a modification of the orthodox view.\r\nMr Smith is mistaken in thinking that we assert the separateness of\r\nmind and body, which is certainly a view incompatible with the facts he\r\nmentions and with a good many other more familiar facts, but neither the\r\nfacts he mentions nor any other facts prove his contention that mind and\r\nbody are identical. If the physical brain is the instrument of an immaterial Shin, then the activity of Shin in the material world must be impaired by injury to the physical brain. We cannot discover whether the source of music is a violin or a musical box merely by noting that progressive destruction of the mechanism causes progressive interference with the\r\nmusic. Loss of mental efficiency through destraction of brain tissue is to be expected either on the hypothesis that the brain is an instrument or\r\nthat it is an automatism, so evidence of such loss cannot decide which of\r\nthese alternative hypotheses is true. Similarly, experimental work on the part played by chemical organisers\r\nin promoting growth does not disprove the hypothesis of an entelechy or Shin control of growth. The most that any biochemist would claim is that\r\nhe knows no facts which necessitate such a hypothesis. It cannot be\r\ndisproved ' for ever ', because new facts may always be found which do\r\n'^All the equipment required for simple card-guessing experiments may be obtained from the Society. Zener cards can be supplied at 3s. 6d. for packets of 50\r\nand printed forms for recording guesses at is. 6d. for 50. Advice on how to carry out experiments and to assess the results is given in Dr Seal's pamphlet CardGuessing: Advice and Instructions to Experimenters, which can be bought for is. 6d. from the Secretary.\r\n3o6 Journal of The Societyfor Psychical Research oct.-nov. 1943\r\nnot fit into the orthodox biochemical system of explanation. We suggest\r\nthat certain facts of psychical research do demand such a hypothesis. This\r\ncannot be disproved by any work by a biochemist which does not take\r\naccount of these facts. Incidentally, by no means all biologists accept the view that the discovery of organisers and other factors directing development has rendered\r\nunnecessary the ' vitalistic ' hypothesis. Organisers (i.e. substances or\r\nfactors determining development), like other demonstrable physical factors,\r\nmay belong to the mechanism by which entelechy acts. But it is outside\r\nthe scope of this journal to extend the argument to the biological field,\r\nthough it might be mentioned, for the sake of accuracy, that we are not, as Mr Smith seems to suppose, both psychologists ; we are a psychologist\r\nand a biologist.\r\n. - . Yours etc., R. H. Thouless\r\n' - _\r\n' B. P. WiESNER\r\nThe Investigation of Spontaneous Cases\r\nSir,\u2014May I have space for a few remarks on Dr West's paper on ' The\r\nInvestigation of Spontaneous Cases ' [Proceedings, Vol. XLVIII, Pt. 175)?\r\nI realise fully the desirability of ' Podmorean ' criticism from time to time,\r\nas a wholesome check on over-enthusiasm ; at the same time I feel very\r\nstrongly that carping criticism often does more harm than good, and it seems to me that his paper is a case in point.\r\nFrom my own experience I know that reports of events may often be\r\nincomplete, especially if made by those untrained in making such reports,\r\nand yet the events themselves be perfectly valid. If someone sees a\r\n' ghost ', this event is liable to make a deep impression upon him, especially if it is subsequently found to correspond with some event, such as the\r\ndeath of the person so indicated. The mere fact that it was not entered\r\nin a diary, or written-up at the time, by the percipient, surely does not\r\nprove its uselessness, far less its non-existence. From the point of view\r\nof the psychical researcher, this is unfortunate, but most likely to happen.\r\nFew people will write down their experiences, even when asked to do so!\r\nIt is not as though some complicated series of events were involved, such\r\nas the description of a slate-writing performance, where I admit immediate\r\nnotes are essential, and even then liable to be faulty! But in apparitional\r\ncases, for example, a simple human observation is all that is required, and\r\neven if the date is wrongly given (so long as the coincidence is proved) what\r\nof it? It no more invalidates the case than it would if an observer noted a shower of meteors, but could not remember whether this occurred on the\r\n27th or 28th of the month. The fact is that the shower occurred, and the mere fact that it was not written down at the time would not prove that\r\nthe observation was not made. It was ; so why should we reject his\r\ntestimony because no note of it was made at the time?\r\nI write as I do because I have had an example of this sort of thing in myown experience. Mr Podmore, in his book The Newer Spiritualism,\r\ndevoted a chapter to a criticism of our Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino.\r\nHe attempted to pick flaws in this, and indicate loopholes whereby fraud\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1948 Correspondence\r\ncould have been rendered possible. Thus, on certain occasions (though\r\nrarely) the position of one hand or one foot was not given in the stenographic account ; hence, he concludes, it was free, and further, that it undoubtedly produced the phenomenon in question. As a matter of fact,\r\nwe who were present know that it was 7iot free ; we merely neglected to dictate to the stenographer its exact position at that particular moment,\r\nin the hectic msh of events. (And this by experienced investigators like Feilding, Baggally and myself.) Had the cn'iic been there, he would have\r\nseen that the control was perfect at the time, though not so indicated in the\r\nReport. Many of the criticisms made and theories advanced by the armchair critic would have seemed utterly ridiculous to him, had he been\r\nthere at the time, and actually witnessed what was going on. Loopholes\r\nin a dictated account do not necessarily prove that such loopholes actually\r\nexisted ; the human error was not in the observation, but in the dictated\r\naccount, which was not one hundred per cent perfect\u2014as of course it should have been.\r\nIf this applies to a case such as above, it surely applies to the far simpler\r\ncases of coincidental apparitions, which were not noted in writing at the\r\ntime, but which may have occurred precisely as subsequently stated, and\r\nwhich, as I have said, doubtless made a deep and never-to-be-forgotten\r\nimpression upon the percipient at the time. The arbitrary rejection of\r\nsuch cases on that ground would seem to me to be totally unwarranted.\r\nWhat percentage of legal testimony would be acceptable were such\r\nUtopian standards maintained?\r\nYours etc.,\r\n. Hereward C.-^rrington\r\nSir,\u2014Thank you for showing me Dr Carrington's letter. I did not\r\nintend my paper to imply that all spontaneous cases which fail to reach a high evidential standard are either useless or spurious. As soon as one is satisfied that there are any instances in which normal explanations are impossible, it becomes a safe guess that some of the unsubstantiated cases\r\nare also paranormal. All the same, a certain case is always better than a doubtful one.\r\nI cannot agree with Dr Carrington that apparitional experiences are such\r\nsimple events that contemporary notes are unnecessary. The relevant\r\ncircumstances are often complex, and in^\u2022estigation shows that memory is not a safe guide on these matters.\r\nThe analogy between accounts of spontaneous cases and reports of\r\ntrained observers at a seance is not ver}- close. In the example of Eusapia\r\nPalladino, I sympathise vvith Dr Carrington's exasperation at arm-chair\r\ncriticism, but I also sympathise with the exasperation of the critic who has\r\nto deal with an incomplete account without the opportunity of personal\r\nobservations. It should be our aim to produce records which are completely convincing to readers who have not experienced the phenomena in\r\nquestion.\r\nThe target set in my paper scarcely exceeded the standard of legal\r\nevidence required to convict a murderer. It mav have been arbitrary and\r\nUtopian, but it is not, I hope, impractical. Uncorroborated and weakly\r\n3o8 Joiinial of The Societyfor Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1948\r\nevidenced cases are legion. If progress is to be made and critics silenced,\r\nall the energies of psychical researchers should be directed to obtaining\r\ncases so completely backed up that they cannot reasonably be rejected.\r\nYours etc., _\r\n' D. J. West\r\nForecasts and Precognition\r\nSir, \u2014Mr Drayton Thomas's interesting article ' Forecasts and Precognition ' in the July, 1948 issue of Proceedings merits further discussion.\r\nI have only space to deal with two cases. Since Mr Thomas has treated his cases in a qualitative manner, as opposed to the statistical and objective methods that are now available, I shall discuss most of this material in a qualitative way.\r\nLiverpool Street Station .\r\n'\r\nThere seem to be three coincidences :\r\n(1) Closely associated with Elsie.\r\n(2) You walk down a little hill, not a steep place.\r\n(3) The word ' Avenue ' written up ' or is she only thinking\r\n\" Avenue \"\r\n(1) is highly subjective. It seems to me curious, however, if Liverpool\r\nStreet is so closely associated with her, that Mr Thomas should only\r\nrealise the application as he entered the station.\r\n(2) There is certainly a little hill at Liverpool Street (and at many other\r\nplaces), and one does walk down it to enter the station, but personally I should have said that, as London hills go, it is rather a steep place.\r\n(3) Mr Thomas found two avenues within 200 yards of Liverpool\r\nStreet. Is this exceptional, or would it be expected by chance alone? I am\r\nindebted to my brother, B. J. Western, for performing an experiment on\r\nthis point. A circle, just enclosing parts of the two Avenues named, was drawn on the ' Lightning ' map of London about Liverpool Street. It also\r\nenclosed parts of 70 other streets (none of them avenues)\u2014i.e. one in\r\nthirty-six or 2.78% of the streets around Liverpool Street are avenues. By\r\nrandom sampling in the index of the map it was found that the proportion\r\nof avenues in London as a whole was 5.01% or one in twenty with a standard deviation of .59%. In the seventy-two streets enclosed by the\r\ncircle about Liverpool Street there were only the two avenues which ' to my surprise ' Mr Thomas found. He comments ' The introduction of the\r\nword \" Avenue \" would seem to have been in the nature of a clue, or an\r\nadditional description, by which I might be certain that I had discovered\r\nthe place to which the forecast referred '. His surprise and certainty\r\nappear somewhat unjustified, since it is to be expected, on chance alone,\r\nthat there would be some 3.6 avenues as close as this.\r\nI do not know what the train service was like in 1935, but at present the\r\nCambridge trains from Liverpool Street are generally faster and more\r\nfrequent than those from King's Cross ; Major Mowbray would not need\r\nmuch ' influencing ' by the communicator to choose Liverpool Street.\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1948 Correspondence 309\r\nThe Annunciation Picture\r\nIt is unfortunate that only ' the substance ' of the medium's statements\r\nare quoted.\r\nThere are five apparently significant features :\r\n(1) Blankness of mind and the urge to loolc.\r\n(2) Position with regard to me.\r\n(3) Get the message from the picture. .\r\n\u2022 .\r\n(4) Background : Foreground.\r\n(5) The hly.\r\n(1) is purely subjective and it would be ver^- easy to have a false m.emory\r\nof it after the event.\r\n(2) is vague and ambiguous.\r\n(3) The most obvious message to draw is the one the Angel came to give\r\nto Mary, viz. :\r\n' Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth\r\na son '. But if it be necessary to hunt for less obvious messages in what\r\nthe Angel said, here are a few more :\r\n(a) ' Blessed art thou among women '.\r\n(b) ' (the son) shall be great, shall reign for ever and shall be called the\r\nSon of God '.\r\n(c) ' Thy cousin Elizabeth hath also conceived in her old age '. Among so many, the vague message of being highly favoured does not seem particularly significant.\r\n(2), (3), (4) and (5) are dependent. ' Position with regard to me ' and\r\n' Get the message from the picture ' apply to all Annunciation pictures,\r\nand I believe it is true that most Annunciation pictures (\u00ab) show an Annunciation Lily and {b) have the division into background and foreground of the typical Italian painters.\r\nIf this is so, the prediction boils down to the statement that Mr Thomas\r\nwould shortly see an Annunciation picture. As Mr Thomas is a clergyman,\r\nthis does not seem very unlikely.\r\nThere are also certain general points, among which may be mentioned : (1) In none of Mr Thomas's cases are we given a corroborative statement.\r\n(2) Many of the forecasts are sufficiently vague for there to be many\r\nways in which they might be fulfilled which detracts from their significance.\r\n(3) It is difficult to say exactly how much information the medium\r\nmight not know about Mr Thomas by this time.\r\n(4) We do not know from how large a body of unsuccessful material the\r\nabove cases are selected. In connection with the last two points, the earliest of these Leonard\r\nsittings that Mr Thomas deals with was in Febnaary 19 17. These considerations. Sir, lead to the conclusion that Mr Thomas's\r\narticle is not up to the standard which this Society is entitled to expect for\r\nits publications.\r\nYours etc.,\r\n. - - A. M.

As you were unable to publish my longer\r\nletter owing to lack of space, I should be very glad to send a copy to any\r\nmembers interested, if they will write to me at 22 Beaufort Street, Chelsea,\r\nLondon, S.W. 3.\r\n. Yours etc., Margaret E. Hone\r\nThe Fox Sisters : A Correction\r\nSir,\u2014In the article on the Fox Sisters in the September issue of the\r\nJournal, there was an error which was not noticed until too late for correction. A sentence near the end of the first paragraph on page 282 ought to have read : ' Within a month Kate had recanted, and Margaret followed\r\nsuit a year later.' As the passage stood it might have been supposed that\r\nLeah had retracted a confession, which in fact she never made at any time.\r\nI regret the error.\r\ni - - Yours etc., \u2022\r\n. J. Fraser Nicol\r\n- ' REVIEWS\r\nThe Myth of the Magus. By E. M. Butler. (Cambridge University\r\nPress. 1948. xi, 282 pp. Illustrated. 21s.)\r\nThough she disclaims the authority of a historian, Professor Butler's\r\nstudy is essentially historical. Starting to investigate the Faust legend,\r\nshe was led to the wider study of the Magician, as presented by legend and\r\nhistory. She finds in the story of each prominent Magus a pattern, certain\r\nbasic correspondences with the rest. This pattern consists of ten features,\r\nnot all of them present in each instance, but constant enough to be listed as insignia ; and no magician of stature fails to score several of them. They\r\nare, as she gives them : supernatural or mysterious origin ; portents at birth ; perils menacing infancy ; an initiation ; wanderings in distant\r\nOCT.-Nov. 1948 Reviews 311\r\nlands ; a magical contest ; a trial or persecution ; a last scene, whether of\r\nleavetaking, prophecy, or repentance ; a violent or mysterious death and\r\na resurrection, with sometimes an ascension as well. All the features are present in the life of Jesus, whom Professor Butler\r\ntreats with the sam.e detachment as she gives to her other subjects They\r\ninform the legend of Zoroaster, are repeated all but exactly in the story of\r\nApollonius of Tyana, and colour the lives of other ancient magicians\r\nincluding Pythagoras, and even Moses, to whose story one or t^vo missing\r\nfeatures were later tacked on. The advent of Christianity introduced a new moral element, a sharp distinction between white and black magic\r\nunder which Simxon Magus was the first to fall: and presently the\r\nChristian church expressly condemned all magic not practised in its name\r\nand by its accredited representatives.\r\nThis attitude drove the mediaeval magi into direct opposition, and pacts with the devil became a necessary qualification for the job. Of Dr Faust, who, if not the prototype, became the chief representative of this type of\r\nmagician, Professor Butler finds little good to say. The man himse'f\r\nappears to have been a petty and disreputable conjuror ; and she puts hirn\r\nfonvard as the classic instance of legend devouring and superseding fart\r\ni-or the rest, Jeanne d'Arc is treated side by side with Gilles de Rais and\r\nRoger Bacon, considered after Faust on the ground that although he lived m the thirteenth century-, his fame did not flower until the sixteenth Dr John Dee shares a chapter with Edward Kelley, the medium who did\r\nhis skrymg ' for him, followed by the Com.te de St. Germain, who has a long and admirable chapter to himself, and Cagliostro. More recent\r\ntimes are represented by Madame Blavatsky and Rasputin.\r\nIt is always easy to demand of a book that it be somethiuP it is not\r\nand Professor Butler's modest disclaimers on p. 10 make one feefpositivelv\r\nunchivalrous to complain.\r\n' In this slight and superficial contribution to the history of ideas, I have\r\nkept as far as possible on the legendary level, reproducing widespread\r\nconceptions and beliefs rather than historical data.' As a result, it is difficult to see where her own beliefs lie. Ever\\'thing however preposterous, that has been alleged and believed about a mapic-'ai^\r\nis set down with the same detachment as the historical data which Professor Butler has tended to avoid. True, she often shows that she does\r\nnot believe a claim : but we could be pardoned for concluding that she\r\nbelieved none of the material, and lumped all the magicians together as chanatans, more or less inspired. To some she grants in their heyday the\r\npossession of mana, inspiration, energy, power over the minds of those\r\nabout them. For Cagliostro she suggests the explanation of a dual\r\npersonality, of which the shadow side was ' the blackguard Giuseppe\r\nBalsamo . She does not attempt to decide the proportion of fraud in the\r\nlife Ox Madame Blavatsky, who must have needed an exceptional degree of\r\nmana to make the impression she did upon a number of intelligent and some exceptional men. Of Rasputin she gives us little but a bowdlerised\r\naccount of his death. She draws no clear line between the conjuring tricks\r\nof the various magi and their attested or alleged supernorm^al feats. Once again, it is a vice of reviewing to complain that an author lias not\r\ndone what he never claimed to do. But for readers of this journal the\r\n313 Journal of Tlie Societyfor Psychical Research oct.-nov. 1948main interest in a book about magicians must always be its investigation ofthe phenomena they are said to produce. V\/hat are magical powers, andwhat do they mean? If we see a piece of matter move in apparent defianceof the laws of gravity, or a cut closed and healed in a few minutes, what arewe seeing? Nothing ' unnatural ', certainly : but what? What law, whatsecret of the universe is in operation before our ej^es?\r\nProfessor Butler is on sure ground when she says that the magicianalmost always falls through trying to translate inspiration from the realmof imagination to the realm of matter. So translated, it becomes capriciousand often destructive. In fact, she lets fall so m.any hints that we are eagerfor her to turn her cool, clear, sceptical mind to the problems which mostinterest us. As it is, she has done an entirely admirable piece of spadework, for which many of her successors will bless her. It is seldomrecognised how essential are books of this kind, which bring together andrelate whole masses of knowledge and give them fresh relevance, freshmeaning. The book is charmingly written, and in places, particularly in\r\nthe study of Madame Blavatsky, shows a most human un-historical\r\ncompassion.\r\nL. A. G. S.\r\nHypnotism Today. By L. M. Lecron and J. Bordeaux. (London : Heinemann. 1947. ix, 278 pp. 25s.)\r\nThe first part of this book deals briefly with the early work on hypnosisThis is follov\/ed by a detailed chapter describing the many and varied\r\nmethods of inducing hypnosis. Unlike many books on the subject, whichdismiss the methods of induction in a few paragraphs, the authors of this\r\nlittle book must be congratulated on the way they have set out this chapter,\r\nwhich not only puts before the reader a very clear description of how to hypnotise but also records some interesting observations which, if not\r\ntaken into account, may be responsible for the failures met with in somesubjects.\r\nSuccessive chapters deal with hypnotic and post-hypnotic phenomenaand how to produce them. Then follows an interesting section entitled\r\n' Hypnotism and the Psychic Sciences ' and this dispells the very commonbut erroneous belief that hypnotism is allied to the occult. Mention is made of a trance medium who was given pentothal (a barbiturate drug) in\r\norder to induce narcosis and on many later occasions this same subject was hypnotised by one of the usual methods. When asked to comparethese two conditions, narcosis and hypnosis, he said he found it difficult to think clearly under the pentothal but that the hypnosis and mediumistictrance were identical in every respect. Another medium made the samestatement, but added that in his opinion the trance state was not autohypnosis but a hypnotic state produced by his guides.\r\nThe second part of the book deals with Hypnotherapy and describes\r\nhow hypnosis can be used with effect in many psychological complaints.\r\nThe authors also explain, in detail, the make-up of many 'nervous' disorders and do not hesitate to admit that hypnotism is not used as a cure but only as an aid in certain selected cases to reveal facts long since\r\nrepressed and by so doing, effect an abreaction which will lead to the cure\r\nof the condition.\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1948 Reviews 313\r\nThe dangers of inexperienced persons using hypnotherapy as opposed to hypnosis is emphasised.\r\nI. F.\r\nDimensions of Personality. By H. J. Eysenck, Ph.D. (London : Kegan Paul. 1947. xi, 308 pp. 25s.)\r\nThis is an important work on the nature of personahty differences as revealed by the technique of multiple factor analysis. It has become clear\r\nin recent years that the popular names for character traits form a very- unsatisfactory basis for scientific description. Multiple factor analysis\r\noffers a method by means of which one can construct a self-consistent\r\nscheme of personality measurement. From a group of male neurotic\r\nsoldiers, it appeared that two main directions of variation could be\r\nmeasured, labelled respectively ' neuroticism ' and ' extraversion-introversion '. Tests were selected which were found to be discriminatory of\r\nthese traits while other tests failed to measure them. The factor of\r\n' suggestibility ' appeared to be analysable into three factors which Dr\r\n. Eysenck calls ' primary suggestibility ', ' secondary suggestibility ' and\r\n' prestige suggestibility '. Those who wish to apply personality tests to the task of distinguishing those who are Kkely to succeed in parapsychological tests would do well to take into account the work on personality\r\nmeasurement that has been done by Dr Eysenck and others. They will not find Dr Eysenck's book particularly easy reading if they are not\r\nfamiliar with the methods of factor analysis.\r\nR. H. T.\r\nBooks Received\r\nEncyclopaedia of Superstitions.

In his foreword Mr Strong remarks\r\nthat the value of the book, which for him ' nowhere approaches the level of scientific proof [of survival] \u2014though I believe a good deal of it\u2014is that\r\nit helps to create a state of mind in which this most important question of\r\nsurvival can be seriously considered '.\r\nExploring the Psychic World.
