PAGE\n1\n4\n!)\n14\n16\ncl\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 55th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West-\ni minster Town Hall on Friday, December 2nd, at 8.30 p.m. ;\nthe\n\/j^ President in the chair.\nMr. R. Peaesall Smith read a paper on \"The Lourdes Miracles\n1 and other cures by Mental Impression.\" The paper was chiefly occu-\nH^pied with a number of cases, most of which had occurred in Mr. Pearsall\n'\n^ Smith's own family, of sudden and complete cures of more or less\nJ)\nserious disorders that had followed on a religious faith or a determined\nJ expectation on the part of the patient or the operator that the disorder\n^ would be cured. In three cases he was himself the operator, once on\nJ:3 himself and twice on two of his children. In another case, a boy of\nJ\n12 years old, the son of his family physician, had broken his arm and\nM had it set by a surgeon at Chicago. Two days later the boy, being con-\nvinced that, as the result of prayer, the arm was cured, had the splints\n2 removed and it was found to be fit for use. The case was related to\nMr. Pearsall Smith at the time by the two physicians, but the subject,\nnow a physician himself, writes that he believes that the arm was not\nseriously injured and that it recovered in the ordinary way. With\nregard to the miracles of Lourdes, Mr. Pearsall Smith said that the\nstatistics of failure and of relapses should be given as well as the\nnarratives of success. He spoke of the expectant mental attitude of\nthe pilgrims, intensitied as it was by religious fervour, and the con-\ntagious excitement of the crowds gathered together, and said that\nunder the circumstances it was not remarkable that numbers of them\nshould be healed ;\nwhereas the cures he had described from his own\nexperience had aU occurred under circumstances of quiet, mostly with\nS\n\f2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan ,\n1893.\nvery few persons 'presein;. lie thougnt thiit' h6ih. classes of cures,\nhowever, were attributable, tq the same causes, ,and concluded by\nexpressing the opiiiipii\/ ,\nthat Teligion; may ' nc as a special\nmiracle the healings which' are constanfly effected by other means.\" .\nMr. Myers remarked that there was a considerable literature in\nAmerica on the subject of \" Faith-healing,\" but the diagnoses of cases\nand the details given were mostly so loose and inadequate as to be\nutterly worthless for scientific purposes. He urged that any member\nof the S.P.R. who knew of such cases, whether American or English,\nshould send the details to him for investigation by medical experts.\nProfessor Barrett said that he had seen the subject of the case\nat Chicago described by Mr. Pfearsall Smith, and heard from him that\nhe did not now regard his cure as in any way supernatural. He him-\nself had seen cases of \" faith-healing,\" but none that he considered\naltogether satisfactory, viz., none in which the necessary medical\nexamination before and after the alleged cure had been conducted by\nthe same medical man.\nThe PvEV. R. F. Clarke, S.J., maintained that none of the cases\nquoted by Mr. Pearsall Smith would have been claimed as miracles at\nLourdes ex:cept that of the boy at Chicago. At Lourdes, certificates\nare required from the doctors before and after the alleged cures, which\nthen are not counted as miracles until 12 months have passed with-\nout a relapse occurring. He gave the case of a stone-cutter whose\neyesight had been entirely destroyed by a small piece of stone having\nentered the eye. He was cured instantly after washing it with some\nLourdes w\\at3r. Another man, who, according to the medical certificate,\nhad had the bones of his leg broken into several pieces by the trunk of\na tree falling on it, was cured instantly at Lourdes. He did not deny\nthat there were many failures \u2014the proportion of successes being only\nabout two or three per cent. Neither did he deny that a certain\nnumber of the cures\u2014e.^\/., of paralysis, hysteria, etc. \u2014might be\naccounted for by ordinary means. Such cures were not called miracles\nat Lourdes, but \" graces \" or \" material favours.\" There were, however,\nsome cases of the healing of organic lesions that were absolutely incur-\nable, or would take many months to be cured, by ordinary means. No\none was so careful not to admit the occurrence of miracles as th'j\nauthorities of the Catholic Church. At Lourdes, the shrine was not\nrecognised by the Bishop for a long time. A few cures took place in\nthe crowd, where excitement might be supposed to play a part, but the ,\ngreater number occurred in the bath, in the presence of two or three\nwitnesses only, where there could be no excitement. The patients were\nexamined by sceptical and critical doctors, one of whom, Dr. Boissane,\nhad published the results of his inquiry in a book called Lourdes\n\fJax., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 3\nHistoire Medicale (published by Victor Lecoffre, Paris, 1891). The\nspeaker hoped that the whole matter would be subjected to the same\nkind of careful and strict investigation that characterised the work of\nthe S.P.R.\nThe President said that he should like to add a fevv words to what\nhad been already said, chiefly to enforce one point on which all previous\nspeakers were agreed, that the whole group of facts brought before us\nthis evening is one to which it is very desirable that serious attention\nshould be directed. He thought that he might fairly claim for the\nS.P.R. that those who had systematically taken part in its work during\nthe last ten years would be likely to be among the very small number\nof persons really able to approach the inquiry in an impartial frame of\nmind. He was very glad to hear from Father Clarke that their inves-\ntigators would be cordially received at liourdes, and he felt sure that\nit would only be the absorption of their energy in other work that\nwould delay their undertaking this.\nThe question how to draw the line between natural phenomena and\nmiracles, to determine when\u2014if ever\u2014a phenomenon, alien to ordinary\nexperience and apparently inexplicable by any known laws, was to be\nregarded as clearly outside the complex system of causally connected\nchanges which we call nature, was a question of profound difficulty.\nHe was not himself prepared to attribute to the authorities of the\nCatholic Church that penetration into the secrets of the physical world\nwhich appeared to him necessary to answer this question ; but he was\nequally of opinion that the leading scientific authorities had failed to\nshow philosophic insight in their attempts to draw this difficult line.\nAs an instance of the limited insight of both classes of authorities, he\nmight refer to the phenomena of stigmatisation. These phenomena\nnot long ago were not only regarded by the Catholic Church as\nevidences of special divine interference, but were also confidently\ndeclared by an eminent physiologist to be \" either miraculous or fraudu-\nlent.\" But now, by means of hypnotic experiment, they had been\nbrousrht within the range of the natural action of the mind on the\nbodily organism. He thought this an instructive warning, both to the\nreligion and to the science of their day, to recognise humbly the narrow\nlimits of their present knowledge of the ways of Nature and the ways\nof God.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers read a paper on \" Some Further Cases of\nCrystal Vision,\" which will be included in his paper on \" Sensory\nAutomatism and Induced Hallucinations,'' to appear in the next num-\nber of the Proceedings. He mentioned the development of an allied\nautomatic power of \" shell-hearing \" in Miss X, with whose experiments\nthe Society are already familiar ; and among several new cases he\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan.,\nespecially instanced the power of retrocognitive and other visions\npossessed by a lady who wished to be known as Miss A, in connection\nwith whom he invited Sir Joseph Barnby, who was present, to relate\ncertain striking experiences.\nSir Joseph Barnby then read an account, which will appear in Mr.\nMyers's paper, of his own testimony to some veridical experiences which\nliad occurred to Miss A in his presence.\n[Glass balls, well suited for crystal-gazing, can be obtained from the\nAssistant Secretary for 2s. 6d., and Mr. Myers would be grateful for\naccounts of any experiments which may be tried.]\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nL. 946.\nThe following sets of experiments in thought-transference have\nbeen carried out at intervals from November, 1891, to October, 1892,\nby Miss R. C. Despard and Miss C. M. Campbell. MissDespard was\nin all cases the agent, and Miss Campbell the percipient. They tried\nsome experiments in which these parts were reversed, but obtained no\nsuccess. Notes were made at the time, and the notes of all the ex-\nperiments so far tried with Miss Despard as agent have been sent to us,^\nexcept those of the lirst trials made in the transference of diagrams,\nthese having been lost. With this exception a complete account of all\nthe experiments tried is printed below.\nBoth Miss Despard and Miss Campbell are known to Mr, Myers.\nAll the experiments except the two last described were made with\nagent and percipient in the same room, and Miss Despard thus\ndescribes their relative positions :\n\" [Miss Campbell] as percipient sat in an armchair, behind and\nrather to one side of a large square table at which I (agent) sat, I\nhaving ray back to her. I placed the cards or colours on the table in\nfront of me and then drew the one to be thought of from the pack.\nIn this position, the view of the cards was quite sliut out by my body.\nFurther, the percipient found she could do better by removing her glasses\nand closing her eyes, as she was not then distracted by outside objects.\"\nThe first experiments, in the guessing of cards, were as follows :\nNovember 22?ic\/, 7.30 p.wi. \u2014C.

Thus\nthe total number of successful guesses was forty-throe in fifty-six trials,\nwhere the most probable number of successes by chance alone would\nhave been twenty-eight.\nOn January 31st, 1892, experiments were tried in guessing the\nsuits only of the cards, in three sets.\n(1) Fourteen trials ;\neight successes, and three deferred successes.\n(2) Fourteen trials ; six successes, and two deferred successes.\n(3) Fourteen trials ; one success, and two deferred successes.\nTotal : Forty-tsvo trials ; fifteen successes : most probable number\nof successes by chance alone, ten or eleven.\nA note is made :\n\" Last series, marked diminution in clearness of\nvisualisation.

Reproduction, a\ntriangle, in the same position as the original, and with angles about\nequal to the corresponding angles of the latter, but with two of its sides\nproduced.

None of them were reproduced accurately. A snake was\n\fJan,, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\ndescribed as a \" tobacco pipe with long stem, twirling about as if held\nby someone at centre of stem.\"\nMiss Campbell thus describes the impressions that she had as per-\ncipient ;\n\u2014\n\" The impressions were sometimes visualised by the percipient ;\ne.g,\nthe colour diagrams ;\n[the red triangle (No. 1)] being very distinct\nas to shajK, but the colour being the result of a different kind of im-\npression, more nearly approaching the auditory than the visual, but in\n[the yellow disk (No. 2)] of the same set, colour and shape were\nvisualised at the same time. None of the cards or numbers were\nvisualised, the percipient merely feeling as if impelled to name the par-\nticular card or number. In the colour experiments, the impression\nwas received sometimes one way, sometimes the other. In the experi-\nment of June 22nd (scalpels) the impression was visualised, in that of\nOctober 25th (gloves) there was first an auditory impression, as if some-\none had said the word \"gloves \" and then the gloves themselves were\nvisualised.\"\nMiss Despard adds :\n\u2014\n\" The agent invariably visualises her thoughts.\"\nThe two last experiments referred to in the above letter are of the\ngreatest interest, since in them the agent and percipient were in\ndifferent places.\nThe account of them is as follows :\n\u2014\n^-^Q^ l\n\" June 22nd, 1892.\n\" Arranged that R. C. Despard shall, when at the School of\nMedicine in Handel-street, W.C., between 11.50 and 11.55, fix her\nattention upon some object which C. M. Campbell, at 77, Chesterton^\nroad, W., is by thought-transference to discover.\"\nPercipient's Account.\n\"Owing to an unexpected delay, instead of being quietly at home at\n10 minutes to 12, I was waiting for my train at Baker-street, and as\njust at that time trains were moving away from both platforms, and\nthere was the usual bustle going on, I thought it hopeless to try on my\npart, but just while I was thinking this, I felt a sort of mental pull-up,\nwhich made me feel sure that Miss Despard was fixing her attention,\nand directly after I felt ' my\u2014compasses\u2014no scalpel '\nand seemed to see\na flash of light as if on bright steel, and I thought of two scalpels, first\nwith their points together, and then folding together into one ;\njust\nthen my train came up.\n\" I write this down before having seen Miss Despard, so am still in\nignorance whether I am correct in my surmise, but as I know what\nMiss Despard would probably be doing at 10 minutes to 12, I feel\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research, [Jan., 1893,\nthat that knowledge may have suggested the thought to me\u2014though\nthis idea did not occur to me until just this minute, as I have written\nit down,\"\n0.

This second idea made no impression on\nMiss Campbell\u2014perhaps owing to the bustle around her at the time.\"\nR. C. Despaed.\n(No. 2.) \u2022\nOctober 25th, 1892.\n\"At 3.30 p.m. R. C.

C D. or\nmyself, and not quite like any of ours in colour. After this I saw a\ntrain going out of a station (I had just returned from seeing someone\noff at Victoria), almost immediately obliterated by a picture of a bridge\nover a small river, but I felt that I was consciously thinking and left\noff the experiment, being unable to clear my mind sufficiently of out-\nside things.\"\nA.gent's Account.\n\" At 3.30 on October 25th I was at 30, Handel-street, Brunswick-\nsquare, W.C.

A-i P\" Apparition.\nThe following account of an apparition seen at the time of death\nby an accident refers to an event that took place many years ago, but\nseems to have been carefully investigated at the time and was written\ndown the day after it happened by the late Sir Thomas Fowell\nBuxton.\nFor a copy of the original manuscript we are indebted to Mr.\nG. Pagenstecher, who writes in sending it :\n\u2014\n206, Portway, West Ham, E., January 2Uh, 1891.\nThe enclosed story [was] taken down by the distinguished philanthropist,\nthe late Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, M.P., from the lips of the person to\nwhom the vision appeared, the day after the event. It was on the 2nd of\nSeptember, 1834, that at Northrepps Hall, the seat of Sir Fowell Buxton,\nabout a mile from Cromer, the family kept the birthday of their eldest son\n(the late Sir Edward North Buxton). In the evening several guns were\nfired, one of which burst and killed the gamekeeper Curtis.\nSir Fowell adds: Dinner began at 6.15 p.m., and the accident took\nplace when the dessert was brought on the table. Curtis saw the vision\nwhen it was still light enough to see a person 200 yards oft\".\n\f10 ^\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan.. 1803.\nAbout 25 years after, I lived in the Buxton family as tutor ;\none evenmg\nthe conversation turned on visions and apparitions, and among others Curtis s\nstory was told. Tlie next day I copied Sir Fowell Buxton's origmal M.b.\nand called upon Curtis, a very quiet, unimaginative, matter-of-fact person, and\nasked him about it. His answer was, that every word of it was true, and that\nhe distinctly remembered all the circumstances, as if they had happened only\nthe day before.

My brother was in excellent spirits, and talked and\nlauc^hed all the way, and said what a pleasure.it was to liim to show respect\nto the family (the Buxtoiis). When we arrived at the Cottage, we were\ntold that positive orders had been given that no Cromer guns should be\niired ; so I returned home, and my brother, very much disappointed, said he\nshould go to the Hall, to look to one of the horses' feet. When I got to\nCromer, and was going into the Brick Hill field, opposite Mr. Gurney\nHoare's house, I was surprised to see my brother coming to meet me. He\nhad on his velveteen shooting jacket, and walked in his usual manner it\nwas quite lic^ht, and I distinctly saw him.

H. Inglis\nPalgrave a third-hand account of the same incident, written by Mr,\nHenry E. Buxton, on October 5th, 1891, which we print below\nColne House, Cromer.\nOn the occasion of the marriage of Mary Upcher to Edmund C. Buxton,\nSeptember 3rd, 1834, there were some festivities at Northrepps Cottage.\nTwo brothers Curtis proposed to iire off their cannon there (they were\nblacksmiths). My grandfather (Sir T. Fowell Buxton) did notjvish this ;\nbut they persevered. On the way one brother said, \" Well, as Mr. Buxton\n(afterwards Sir T. F. B.) does not wish it, I shall go home.' When he got\nnear Cliff House, Cromer (Mr. Hoare's residence), his brother, who had\ngone on to the Cottage to fire the cannon, passed him on the road, but\nalthouo-h addressed did not answer, and soon disappeared.\nHe went home and told what had happened before he heard that his\nbrother had been killed by the cannon exploding.\n'\n\"The Cottage \" was the home of the late Miss Anna Gurney, and is about one\nmile from Cromer, and a quarter of a mile from Northrepps Hall.\n\fJax ,\n1803.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nRichard Hoare (son of Mr. Hoare mejitioiied before, and now living)\nwas nob present, but remembers the facts perfectly, and that his father\nsatisfied himself that Curtis had mentioned the apparition and disappear-\nance of his brother before he heard of the accident.\nHenry E. Buxton.\nIt will be sean that there are a few minor details in which Mr.\nBuxton's narrative differs from the account written at the time, but\nthese hardly affect the evidence, which is further strengthened by some\ninformation given by Mr. Inglis Palgrave himself. He says :\n\u2014\n\"My father (Sir F. Palgrave) had been told of [the incident] at the\ntime it occurred, and had made a note [of it] in a book containing similar\nstories. ... I have been imable to trace the existence of the\nbook. . . . The story [given by Mr. Buxton] is to my remem-\nbrance substantially the same as that in my father's notebook. There\nare, I think, rather more details in my father's account, which I believe\nwas taken down from the statement of the survivor. I think it is mentioned\neither that the survivor spoke to the appearance and received no answer\nor that he was surprised at not being spoken to by his brother, but the\nmain story is to the same effect\u2014that the appearance was seen before\nthe news of the accident had reached the survivor. The time of the\nappearance is stated, I think, in my father's account as being identical\nwith that of the accident.\n\"\nR. H. Inglis Palgravi;.\nL 948. A'l P^ Dream Impression.\nSent by the Rev. Aug. Glardon, M.A., to Mr. Myers.\nTour-de-Peilz, Vaud, Switzerland, Odoher 1st, 1892.\nIn 1868 I had in niy Bible-class a young man, aged 16, to whom 1 was\nvery much attached. He became consumptive, and died after a few months\nillness. I used to go and sit by him for an hour every day during his illness.\nHe had an intense love for me, and was very anxious that I should be\npresent at the moment of his death. During the last day I spent more\ntime with him, and took leave of him only at 9 o'clock at night. I expected\nhe would continue living for a day or two.\nDuring the following night I was sleeping soundly, when I felt that\nAdrien Hary was beside me. I did not see him, nor did I hear his voice. I\njust felt that he was close to me, intimating by his presence that he was\ngoing away nto the other world. He remained a very short time\u2014 say, one\nsecond\u2014and went away.\nThe moment he left me, I felt drawn away after him, my whole being\nbeing, as it were, on the point of meking, of getting dissolved and follow-\ning him. The impression was so powerful that I feel it now in my memory.\nWith a great effort I awoke. My forehead was covered with cold dew.\nI woke my wife, saying to her : \"Adrien has just left, and has been with me\nto let. me know.\" She struck a match ; it was a quarter past two.\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

This evidence, however, is only\nthird-hand and cannot now, probably, be improved. We may observe\nthat complicated visions of the sort here described are shown by our\n\fJan-., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 13\ncensus of hallucinations to be much less common than apparitions of\nsingle figures.\nStatement by Mary Mortlock, noiu servant to the Rev. F. Sail, Bectbr of\nFryern Baniet, North Finchley, Middlesex. Taken down by Mr. F. W. H.\nMyers from her lips, A-pril 5th, 1888 ; then revised a.nd signed by her.\nI never heard or saw anything in any way extraordinary until I went to\nbe cook at Lodge about December 18th, 1883. I had heard nothhig\nwhatever about the house. I was engaged by a Mrs. Bain, who liad taken\nthe house for 6 months from Mrs. Jackson, I believe. As I came up to the\nfront door of the house for the first time I saw a face looking out at me from\nthe windows above the door. It seemed to be a woman's face, very serious\nand stern, with the hair close to the head. It did not smile when I came up,\nbut still I thought it must be one of the maids, and I said to them, '\n' I saw -\nyou were expecting me and looking out.\" They said that no one had been in\nthe room or looked out of the window.\nI was put to sleep in that same room, along with another maidservant.\nWe went to bed and turned down the gas till only a little button of gas was\nalight. Then it seemed to me that the gas turned red and there came more\nlight in the room than the gas would make. The wall opposite my side of\nthe bed, a few feet away, seemed to disappear, and I saw a round table\nwith a red cover and an old lady reading at it, and girls sitting round it.\nThey seemed to be about 12 years old, in high dresses, but I could not\nsee more than their heads and shoulders. They made no noise. Then they\ndisappeared, and then came men with daggers and hilts and girdles, and a\nsort of capes and plumes in their hats, and sandals on their feet, who seemed\nto fight. These made a loud noise. When one of them was struck he\nseemed to fall down. The fight seemed to take place in daylight. All this\nseemed to last about half an hour, then all vanished. I was so terrified that\nI could not move or speak while it went on. I pei-spired so much with fear\nthat the mattress was soaked on the side where I lay.\nThis happened night after night about 20 times, the same figures ap-\npearing, except that sometimes there would be a man with spectacles reading\nat the table instead of the old lady. And one night a white figure seemed\nto leave the group of men who were fighting and to pass round by the end of\nthe bed and disappear into the wall.\nI told nay fellow servant something of what I saw, and asked her to notice\nthat tlie gas turned red as soon as it was turned low. But she could not see\nthis, and laughed at me, and said that it was all nonsense, and always went\nto sleep before the figures came. I did not dare to say any more about the\nfigures, and I got very ill with the fright. I could hardly eat anything, and\nwas too weak to do my work. A doctor was sent for and said that I had had\nsome great mental shock. I did not dare to mention the figures, and I had\nhad no other shock. I became a regular invalid and should liave had to go\nto the hospital but that my mistress very kindly wished me to stay, though\nI could only sit down in the kitchen and direct the cooking, which the\ngardener's wife, Mrs. Hoe, did for me. But after the doctor came the gas\nwas always left high all night, aiid I saw the ligures no more. I was seriously\n\f14 Journal of Society for PsycUcal Research.

I\nstayed in the place till Mrs. Bain left, in May, 1884.\nDurino- my stay the gardener, who lived in a separate buildmg a few yards\nfrom the house, repeatedly complained of noises in a lumber-room next to\nhis bedroom and accused us girls of going there and playmg tricks on him,\nwhich we did not do. The house is an old one, I believe of Queen Elizabeth s\ntime, , 1 1 ui \u2022\nI liave never seen or heard anything strange since then, and my health is\nnow good. I have heard from Mrs. Judd, the wife of a former gardener at\n^Lodo-e that the house has long been haunted, and that a servant-\ngirl had to^leave it from being made ill by fright, long before my time. Mrs.\nWallace, an old inhabitant of Fmchley, has also told me that the house was\nhaunted. Of this I knew nothing when I went to the place.\n! (Signed) Mary Mortlock,\nApril 12th, 1888.

He\noften heard and saw terrible things, he told his wife, but never would reveal\n'\nI have sifted Mrs. Wallace well. All that I can elicit is, that she had\nbeen told by a Mrs. Moore, who many years ago had stayed at \u2014-\nLodge that she had seen exactly the same figures which had troubled\nJane She has been dead about six years, so it is impossible to follow up\nher statement. Its one value is, that it is a corroboration of Jane s\nstory.

Mr. Balfour had other avocations,\nwhich might interfere with his frequent presence at the meetings of\nthe Society, but his interest in its work was strong, an.d had been\nmanifested from the earliest days of the Society's existence. It was,\nof course, Mr. Balfour the philosopher, rather' than Mr. Balfour the\nstatesman, whom they had invited to preside over their deliberations\n;\nand he (the speaker) might remind his audience of the proof of the\nSociety's political neutrality afforded by the presence on the list of\nits honorary members of the name of Mr. W. E. Gladstone.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers being then called upon for the announced\npaper on \" Motor Messages from the Subliminal Self,\" asked leave of\nthe meeting to begin by dwelling at more length than had been possible\nat the last meeting upon the experiments in crystal-gazing to which he\nattached so much importance. He was glad to hear that a gopd many\nof the half-crown glass balls which the Assistant Secretary had on sale\nhad been purchased, and he hoped that several series of experiments\nhad been begun. Mr. Myers then explained the way in which this\nexperiment attached itself to various other experiments now beginning\nto be tried in better-known departments of experimental psychology;\nThe substance of his remarks will be found in Part XXIII. of the\nProceedings, which has since' been issued. In conclusion, he urged the\nessential similarity of these sensory automatisms and the motor auto-\nmatisms on which he now hoped to dwell at the ne^t meeting. ; _\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feh.. ]8fl3.\nIn the discussion which followed, Mr. Myers stated in reply to\nquestions that he had found it thus far impossible to say which form of\nsubliminal message was the most likely to convey truth. Crystal-vision,\nautomatic writing, table-tilting, raps (for in spite of the added diffi-\nculties which they presented, he thought that raps v^ould have to be\ndealt with as a genuine phenomenon)\u2014all these modes of communica-\ntion conveyed a vastly larger percentage of nonsense and error than of\nprovable truth. Yet hj each method in turn he held that provable\ntruth not previously known had been communicated in a proportion\nquite beyond what chance could explain. Only prolonged experiment\ncould show which method was the best for each inquirer to follow, or\nby what signs the veridical answers could be best discriminated from\namid the rubbish in which they often lay concealed.\nMr. Barkworth remarked on the part probably played by self,\nsuggestion in crystal-vision, and on the consequent need of keeping the\nmind as blank as possible during the experiments.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nThe two cases that follow are instances of apparitions seen collectively,\nabout which there is little or no evidence to show that they coincided\nwith any event going on at a distance, or represented any actual person,\nliving or dead. A possible explanation seems to be that a purely\nsubjective hallucination on the part of one of the percipients was\ntransferred to the other, apparently by mental suggestion.\nG. 230. Collective Apparition.\nFrom Mr. Reginald Barber.\n2-1, Lome-grove, Fallowfleld, Manchester, Januarij 21d, 1891.\nIn April of last year, while the light was still good, I was returning\nhome from a walk with uiy wife, and when within a few yards of the gate,\nwhich opens into a straiglit path leading to the house, both my wife and I\nsaw a woman pass through the open gate and walk straight to the house,\nwhen, on reaching the door, she disappeared. I ran to the door, opened it\nwith my latchkey, and expected in my astonishment to find her inside, for\nshe seemed to have walked through the door. It all seemed so real that I at\nonce searched the house, but in vain. We were the only two people in the\nstreet, and did not see the figure until she entered the gate, when we\nsimultaneously exclaimed, \"Who is that?\" She seemed to come oub. of\nspace and go into space again in a most marvellous manner. She wore a\nplaid shawl, and her bonnet was a grey-black with a bit of colour in it. We\ncould not remember hearing any sound as she Avalked, but otherwise we have\nnever seen anything more apparently substantial. It is impossible for us to\nconceive how she could have disappeared if she had been of flesh and blood.\n\fFeb., 1S93.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 23\nIf only one of us had seen this figure, I should have thought little about\nit, as suoli cases of hallucination seem sufficiently common, and may be\naccounted for by some physical or mental disturbance ; but the evidence in\nthis case jooints to the existence of something exterior to ourselves.\nWe are neither of us believers in ghosts or the like, but are two ordinary\nmatter-of-fact people, Reginald BARBErw\nIn answer to our inquiries, Mr. Barber wrote as follows :\n\u2014\nDear Sir, \u2014^I received your letter this morning, and [will] now . . .\nreply to your inquiries. \"Did I or my wife see the figure first ?\n\" My wife\npoints out that I must have seen the figure first, for she did not see it until it\nwas well inside the gate. \" Was there any expectation of a visit ? \" Not the\nleast. \"Give the distance of the apparition when it disappeared.\" A few\nyards, I could not say exactly. When I have heard Mrs. Barber telling\nfriends of our experience, I have noticed that the figure presented to her\nmind does not seem to have been exactly the same as that which was evident\nto my mind. That would appear to support your theory that no real figure\nexisted. Again, Mrs. Barber is sure she spoke first (though I thought we\nspoke at once), and, as she points out, I m w the figure first. This shows\nthat the figure was not suggested by one to the otlier in any ordinary mannei'.\nMrs. Barber, I trust, will send you an account of our experience while I\nam from home.\nI shall be glad to answer any further questions if you think the case calls\nfor them. Reginald Barber.\nMrs, Barber writes :\n\u2014\n24, Lorne-grove, Fallowfield, January uOth, 1891.\nI shall be much pleased to give you my account of \" our ghost.\"\nI may begin by saying that Lorne-grove is a very quiet thoroughfare of\nno great length. During April last year the road was being paved, and\nconsequently in a very chaotic state\u2014full of loose stones, &c. The pave-\nment on the opposite side to our house was already laid, so on returning\nfrom our walk on the 19th of that month my husband and I kept on that\nside of the road until we were exactly opposite our own gate. Up to this\ntime we had seen no one in the Grove.\nMy husband now began to cross the road, l)idding me follow, and take\ncare not to fall on the loose stones. I did so, naturally looking down at my\nfeet, until a little more than half way across the road, or about 6 yards from\nthe gate, when on raising my eyes I saw a grey figure walking up the path\nto the door. She was then about a yard inside the gate, and although she\nhad appeared so mysteriously, I felt no surprise, she looked so thoroughly\ncommonplace and substantial. My husband saw her enter the gate, so there\ncan be no question as to which of us sft\/c her first, but I was certainly the\nfirst to exclaim: \"Who is that?\" although my husband's exclamation\nfollowed so quickly that they might almost be considered simultaneous, as\nindeed I believe Mr. Barber described them in his letter to you. I next\nsaid: \"Stop a moment and let us see who it is,\" but he answered, \"No,\nit is no good letting her ring,\" and hurried forward with his latchkey. The\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychioal Research, [Feb., ison\ndistance from the gate to the door is 7^ yards, and when I first saw the\nfigure I should be about G yards from the gate.\nMy husband would be at least a couple of yards in front of me, and as\nhe saw the figure actually turn in at the gate he had a better view of her\nshawl and bonnet. I only saw that she was in grey, and that it was no\none we knew. She walked quietly up the path and then up the two steps\nto the door, and I always fancy I saw her raise her hand as though to ring\nthe bell, but of that I cannot be sure, and then against the dark door she\nvanished completely, certainly not more than 4 yards from where my\nhusband was standing. We were expecting no visitor, and our thoughts\nwere far away from the supernatural, for just before crossing the road we\nhad been saying how hungry we were, and how we should enjoy our supper,\nI took special note of the date and hour, fully expecting we should hear\nof some occurrence wliich nearly concerned us, but nothing has, so far,\ntranspired. GtERtrude Bakber.\nMr. Barber wrote later:\n\u2014\n24, Lorne-grove, Fallowfield, Manchester, Fehnianj Qth, 1891.\nMrs. Barber tliinks the time we saw the apparition would be as nearly as\npossible seven o'clock ; I merely remember it was about sunset. I am sure\nit was light enough to see to read outside, and within there was no artificial\nlight burning. I remember searching the house by daylight to find the\nfigure we had seen. It was a beautiful, clear, calm evening. We do not\nknow that we have seen anything hallucinatory before or since. If we saw\na figure pass by in the street like the one we have described, its naturalness\nwould cause us to naake no observation. Mrs. Barber says she has often\ntliought slie has seen a cat, though perliaps not with the distinctness of\nnature. Suddenly seeing an object resemblaig a cat might, of course,\nprovoke the illusion.\nMr. Barber says that he has sometimes experienced an auditoiy\nhallucination\u2014namely, fancying that liis wife was calling him by\nname from another room so distinctly that he rose to answer it, but as\nhe reached the door fancied he heard lier calling him back again. He\nhas heard her call him in this way three times, but has had no other\nvisual experience besides the one described above.\nMr. Myers called on Mr. Barber on August 1st, 1891, and gives\nthe following account of his interview:\n\u2014\nAugust 2nd, 1891.\nI saw Mr. and Mrs. Barber yesterday, and inspected the scene of the\napparition. It is c^uite clear that there was no real person on the step.\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Barber turned into the street, a very short and quiet one,\nno one was visible. The figure appeared suddenly, entering the gate\nthrough which you pass over a few yards of flagged walk and up two steps\nto reach the front door.\nThe figure struck Mr. Barljer at the time as noiseless. It is not certai\nthat the figure looked tlie same to Mr. and Mrs. Barber. Mr. Barber, who\nwas in front and s;\\w it best, noticed a check in the shawl, Mrs. Barber\n\fFeb., 1S93.] Journal of Society for Psyddcal Research.\ndid not look carefully at the dress, but took it to be grey. Botli thought the\n\u2022yvoman a beggar, or something of that kind.\nMr. and Mrs. Barber have been about seven years in the house. No\nservant has died there, nor did the figure resemble the previous occupant.\nNeither of them has ever had any other similar experience.\nF. W. H. Myeks.\nG, 231. Collective Apparition.\nFrom Mrs. B.\nFebruary 2nd, 1892.\nI may say that I am not a believer in ghosts, and have no sympathy with\nSpiritualism in any form ; am a member of a Baptist church in this city. I\ngive the following facts, to the best of my recollection, for what they are\nworth, having never been able to find any satisfactory explanation thereof.\nOur family was living in a large, comfortable house, called \u2022 Hall, which\nhad recently been taken for a term of years by my father, F. M., of .\nThere was a passage leading from the outside back door, past the pantry and\ncellar doors to the servants' hall. On the left hand side of the passage,\nlooking towards the back door, there was an opening into the cellar, which\nwas reached by steep stairs. At the time of which I write I was sixteen\nyears of age, my sister, now Mrs. W., being one year older; the year\nprobably behig 1866 or 1867. It was towards twilight ; the time of the year\nI have forgotten. My sister and I were walking together down the passage\ntowards the back door, when we distinctly saw the figure of an old woman,\ndressed in shawl and bonnet, coming towards us, and pass us. We imme-\ndiately turned round, and saw the figure glide towards the cellar steps, where\nshe disappeared, the impression left upon our minds being that she had gone\ndown. As far as my memory serves me, I believe the phantom, or whatever\nit was, was of a transparent, or, at any rate, of an ethereal nature, as she\npassed us without inconvenience in the narrow passage. We were sur-\nprised at seeing this strange figure, and followed her to look down the cellar\nsteps, but saw and heard nothing. I cannot say certainly at this distance of\ntime whether we were very much frightened, or whether we experienced any\nparticular sensations : but what is very clearly stamped upon my mind is the\nridicule heaped upon our story by any who heard it : for whenever we men-\ntioned it we got so laughed at we soon ceased to speak of it at all. I may\nsay, in conclusion, my sister and I were in good health and spirits at this\ntime, and that nothing was further from our thoughts than the possibility of\nseeing anything supernatural. The figure was that of a total stranger, I\nhave never had a similar experience either before or since. The impression\nalways remained upon my mind that I had seen an apparition, and I believe\nmy sister shared that impression. I related this incident to my husband\nsoon after we were married, and it is his interest in this story that has kept\nit in my mind.\nI declare the above to be correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\n[Signed] M B .\n[Signed] W- W (Witness to Mrs. B.'s signature).\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psyckical Research.

He\nsays : \u2014\n-\nThe old hall was afterwards occupied by J. M., but I never heard whether\nhe or his family ever heard or saw anything. There was a hazy report or\nlegend in the district, but nothing that was ever definite.\nPersonally I am and always have been greatly impressed by this incident.\nMy wife mentioned it quite incidentally soon after we were married (1872)\nand has always preserved the same story. I do not think I over heard my\nsister-in-law refer to it. They apparently felt that they were only laying\nthemselves open to ridicule by repeating the story. They could not explain\nit, so dropped it.\nThe evidence of the other percipient, Mrs. W., was obtained through\nMr. B.'s kindness. In a later letter to us he says:\n\u2014\nI learn from Mrs. W. that she is going to send you her statement of the\napparition she and Mrs. B. behoved they saw at Hall. My wife wrote\nher to send her own impressions quite independently of her account, as what\nyou wanted was simple facts or statements apart from any leadings up to any\nconceivable theory.\nMrs. W.'s account, enclosed in a letter dated March 12th, 1892, was\nsent direct to us later, and is printed below.

The figure\nadvanced towards us, then silently gbded past, went slowly down the long\npassage, we watching all the time, until passing through the servants' hall,\nv\/hich was empty, it went through the doorway into the cellar. Instant\nsearch was made by tlie servants, to whom we communicated our experience,\nbut nothing could be found, no trace of the mysterious being brought to\nlight. Most surely was it seen by both of us, and it was an unearthly\npresence, as its whole appearance was semi-transparent and ethereal.\nWe related our adventure to the rest of the family, but receiving\nnothing but scornful derision, we ceased to speak of what we had seen,\nthougli its reahty will ever be stamped on our minds.\n[Signed] L.

The nurse had gone out for the\nafternoon, and there was no one in the house except the maid downstairs.\nThe doors of the dining-room and drawing-room both happened to be\nopen at the time. All at once she heard the most divine music, very sad\nand sweet, which lasted for about two minutes, then gradually died away.\nMy brother jumped from mamma's knee, exclaiming \"Papal papa,\" and\nran through to the drawing-room. Mamma felt as if she could not move\nand rang the bell for the servant, whom she told to go and see who was in\nthe drawing-room. Wlien she went into tlie room, she found my brother\nstanding beside the piano and saying \" No papa 1\" Why the child should\nhave exclaimed these words was that papa was very musical, and used often\nto go straight to the piano when he came home. Such was the impression on\nmamma that she noted the time to a minute, and six weeks after she received\na letter saying her sister had died at the Cape, and the time corresponded\nexactly to the minute that she had heard the music.

Vernon, 18, West Cedar-street, Boston.\nMarch. 31st, 1891.\nIn the year 1845 Mr. Hervvig, a German, and a much esteemed musician,\nwho had for several years resided in Boston, Massachusetts, died suddenly\nin that city. I was then a young girl, and knew him only through his high\nreputation, and my own great enjoyment of his delightful performances on\nthe violin in public concerts. The only joersonal association I ever had with\nhim was, that in tlie winter before his death, in returning to my home from\nthat of a friend who was studying with me, I chanced for many weeks to\nmeet Mr. Herwig almost daily on a certain part of Beacon-street. It seemed\nto be only an accident, but finally it became such a. constant occurrence that\nhe smiled on me kindly, and gave me a respectful little bow, which I ven-\ntured as respectfully to return.\nThe following autumn he died, as I have said, very suddenly, and his\nfuneral took place on November 4th, 1845, in Trinity Church\u2014then on\nSummer-street, Boston. It was a solemn and touching service, attended by\na crowd of musicians and other eminent citizens, for all mourned the loss\nof such an accomplished and valuable man. I was present with my sister,\nand, in the midst of the services, there came to me a most unaccountable and\ninexpressible feeling that he might then and there at once rise from the\ncoffin and appear in life again among us. Hardly knowing what I did, I\ncaught my sister's hand, exclaiming almost aloud, \"Oh, he must, he must\ncome to life again !\n\" so very earnestly tha.t she looked at me in wonder and\nwhispered \"Hush ! hush !\n\" That evening my mother, my two sisters, a\nfriend (Mr. S., from Cuba), and myself\u2014live of us in all \u2014were sitting in\nour dining-room. No. 4, H. Street, Boston, while my sister and I were de-\nscribing the funeral. My sister had just told of my singular exclamation\nwhile there, and I was repeating the words, Avhen suddenly the room was\nfilled with a burst of glorious music, such as none of us had ever heard. I\nsaw a look of astonishment and even fear on every face, and, in a sort of\nfright myself, I continued speaking incoherently when, once more, after a\nsliglit pause, came a similar full swell of harmony which then died softly\naway. My sister and I at once rushed to the hall door, which was but a few\nsteps from us, to discover if outside there were any music, but we heard not\na sound save the hard drizzle of a dark rainy night. I then ran upstairs to\nthe parlour over the dining-room, where was only a Quaker lady reading.\nA piano was in that room, and, though it was closed, I asked, \" Has anyone\nbeen playing 1 \" \"No,\" she replied, \" But I heard a strange burst of music,\nWhat Wfis it ?\n\"\n\f1'eb., 1893.] journal of Society for PsycUical Research.\nIsuw, let it be understood that, as a family, we had never been supersti-\ntious, but, on the contrary, had been educated to scoff at the idea of\nghosts, omens, &c., so that none of us announced this occurrence as super-\nnatural, but could only look at each other saying, \" What was it ? \" The\nQuakeress, however, we found more excited than ourselves. She related\nthe experience to her daughters, who were absent at the time, and they\nspent much time in perambulating the neighbourhood to discover if there\nhad been any music in the houses near ours ; but it was distinctly proved\nthat there had been none, nor had any been heard from the street. In fact,\nwhat we heard seemed to be close around ourselves, as we each described it,\nand unlike any we had ever heard.\nIt may seem strange that, after so many years, I should be able to de-\nscribe so particularly this event. But I own it made a deep impression\nupon the minds of all the hearers. I have often narrated it, and heard\nthe others narrate it in exactly the same way, and my sister, the only\none now living of that little company, will verify my description word\nfor word.\nI add my replies to some questions which have been asked.\nWhen we went to the hall door we looked up and down the street, wliich\nwas well lighted. Street performers upon musical instruments were abso-\nlutely unknovvn in Boston at this period.\nMrs. S., the Quaker lady of whom I have spoken, was staying in the\nhouse as a guest. I asked whether anyone had played upon the piano, not\nbecause the music bore any resemblance to that of a piano, but to connect\nit, if possible, with some natural cause.\nThe music appeared to all of us to be in the room where we were\nsitting. It seemed to begin in one corner, and to pass round the room. I\nsaid that it was like a burst of sunshine in sound, and can give no better\ndescription of it.\nMy mother and Mr. S. agreed that the music was utterly inexplicable.\nMy sister and I, as well as the daughters of Mrs. S., made thorough in-\nquiries at all the houses about us, but could hear nothing that could account\nfor the phenomenon.

Davey's Experiments 33\nReply to the above 36\nMeetings of the American Branch 48\nThe Edmund Gurney Library Fund 48\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE LATE MR. S. J. DAVEy's EXPERIMENTS.\n{To the Editor of the Jouknax of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir, \u2014In reference to the explanations of Mi\\ Davey's methods of conjur-\ning, given by Mr. R. Hodgson in the Proceediivjs of July last, I wish to\nmake a few remarks. It is, of course, quite clear, from the facts now given,\ntliat Mr. Davey was a very clever conjurer ; that he possessed the somewhat\nrare natural faculties of the high-class prestidigitateur ; and that lie had culti-\nvated these faculties in the special department of imitating slafe-ivritlivj and\nother spiritualistic phenomena. It also seems clear to me that he possessed\nthe faculty of thought-reading and thought-impressing in a high degree ;\nand,\nfurther, it seems probable that he also possessed mediumistic power, whicli\noccasionally took part in his performances.\nIn regard to some of the sittings, Mr. Hodgson's explanations are so full\nas to show that all was performed by clever trick, but in others there is no\nexplanation given, except a general reference to the \"methods\" used in\nother cases. I have neither time nor inclination to go into these cases in\ndetail, nor would there be any use in doing so. The important question is,\nwhether the methods which Mr. Davey used in his trick- performances are\nsuch as will serve to explain most, or all, of the slate-writing of professional\nmediums. I shall, therefore, accept Mr. Hodgson's challenge (in Froceedings,\nVol. lY., Part XL, p. 404) to point out exactly where the difference lies\nbetween Mr. Davey's performances and those of mediums.\nI have not myself had so much experience of slate-writing as many other\nSpiritualists, nor have I received such marvellous and demonstrative tests as\nhave occurred to others. But I have witnessed successful .slate-writing with\nfour dilferent mediums ; and their proceedings, in the three best cases,\naiforded none of the opportunities for trickery on which Mr. Davey appears\nto have mainly relied. I will now point out some of the conditions and\narrangements on which Mr. Davey's performances depended, and which were\nnot present on the occasion of either of my sittings.\n\f3i Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., mi.\n1. Mr. Davey on several occasions asked his visitors to bring three slates\nwith them, wliich afForded him the opportunity of writing on one of them,\nand substituting this for one of the others after they had been cleaned for\nthe exxjeriment.\nOn no occasion were any slates asked for previous to my sitthigs, but a\nsingle slate was once taken, and writing obtained on it without its leaving\nmy sight or that of my brother.\n2. During the greater number of Mr. Davey's sittings ho left the room,\neither before or in the midst of the performance, often more than once,\ngiving him the opportunity required for some of his best tricks.\nAt none of my sittings did the medium leave the room\n.\n3. Many of Mr. Davey's tricks depended on tlie slate being lield nndcr\nthe table.\nAt none of my sittings, except the first (with Slade), were the slates ever\nput under the table.\n4. Mr. Davey had a duster and blotting-paper on his table, used osten-\nsibly for cleaning and drying tlie slates, but which were of great use to liim\nin concealing and transposing tliem.\nAt none of my sittings were either of these articles on the table, a small\npiece of sponge being the only thing used for cleaning the slates.\n5. Long waiting, during the sittings, to relax the attention of the sitters,\nwas used by Mr. Davey.\nAt none of my sittings did I have to wait more than five or ten\nminutes, in several much less. At my best sitting, with Fred Evans in San\nFrancisco, seven slates filled with writing or portraits, including letters\nsigned with the correct Christian name or initials of several long deceased\nmembers of my family, together with six portraits produced on paper\ntouched by no one but myself, were obtained in a sitting of about half an\nhour.\n6. At some of Mr. Davey's sittings the visitors were in the room an hour\nbefore the seance began, during which time some of their slates were taken\naway and written on.\n7. During some of the slate experiments, other tricks, with glasses, coins,\netc., were sometimes interpolated, at other times three or more sitters were\nintermixed in one experiment, thus causing confusion and affording the\nopjjortuirity for writing on or transposition.\nNothing of this kind occurred during either of my sittings.\n8. Mr. Davey asked his sitters to change places, sometimes more than\nonce during tlie same sitting ; thus offering other opportunities for manipula-\ntion of the slates.\nNo such change was made dming my sittings for slate-writing.\n9. Apparently all Mr. Davey's visitors sat at the table, or if there were\nany onlookers they were, like Mr. Hodgson, in the secret.\nAt one of my best sittings (with Keeler at Washington) a friend sat\nabout a yard back so as to see all that j^assed at the table where I and\nthe medium sat. On this occasion I examined two slates, tied them together,\nplaced my hand on them, on the table, the medium i^lacing his hand on\nmine, and in a minute or two I opened the slates and found several lines\n\fMar , 1803.] Joarnat of Society for Psychical Mesecirch.\nof writing inside. Nothing else whatever hajDpened, and any substitution\nwas simply impossible.\nAt the sitting with Evans, I and my brother sat witli the medium at the\ntable, and two friends, who had had numerous sittings before, sat al)out three\nyards ofF, so as to see all that passed, while leaving the seance wholly to us.\nThese conditions are, I subnat, the Juost unfavourable to any trickery by the\nmedium.\nI have now pointed out nine distinct features which differentiate Mr.\nDavey's performances from those of the slate-writing mediums I have\nhad tlie opportunity of observing. Tliese features, either singly or in\ncombination, constitute the essential conditions of most of Mr. Davey's\nconjuring performances ; and they correspond so closely with those used\nby all conjurers, and are so different from those adopted hy most mediums,\nthat the difference would have been at once noticed had those familiar with\nthe slate-^^'riting of a number of different mediums been allowed to witness\nMr. Davey's experiments.\nThere are a few points in connection with Mr. Davey's power of thought-\nreading and willing, and perhaps of mediumship, which call for notice. In\nProceed ' nrjs, Part XI., p. 406, Mr. Davey tells us that he was affected a good\ndeal during his first experiments with \"involuntary movements.\" Such\nmovements are almost universal in the earlier stages of mediumship. Many\nof his sitters report that he was \" violently agitated, \" that electric shocks\nseemed to pass through him ; that he exhibited great nervous strain with\nbeads of perspiration. These are usual phenomena with some mediums, but\nMr. Davey does not tell us whether or no they were all simulated by him.\nAt p. 412 of same Proceedings, Mr. Davey describes how he asked a gen-\ntlejnan to tldnh of a number, apparently with no limitation as to number of\ndigits. He then writes on a slate what he tliinUs is the number, and it proves\nto be correct, namely, 98. He adds that he has had \"several somewhat\nsimilar experiences.\" This faculty, with the corresponding one of impress-\ning his thoughts on others, he evidently calculates on ; for Mr. Hodgson tells\nus {Proceedings, Part XXII., p. 275) that he draws a figure or number that\nhe tltinls the sitter is most likely to choose. Also, in his book experiments,\nhe calculates on forcing a sitter to choose the book he requires. The record\nof his sittings shows that he tried this experiment with ten different sitters ;\nwith four it failed or was inconclusive, but with the other six it succeeded\nmore or less completely. Kow it is certain that with sitters whose choice\nwas uninfluenced, not more than, if so many as, one in ten would choose the\none book, out of a hundred or more, placed conspicuously in order to be\nchosen. Most people would avoid such a book. Not only the book has to\nbe forced, but the line or page, chosen by chance and sometimes neither\nspoken nor written down, has to be accounted for. In several cases the\nwords found on the slate were correct for either line or jjage, and sometimes\nfor both, as in Sitting VII., of whicli no explanation is given. Then we\nhave Mr. Dodds' case, where he chooses Taine on Intelligence, because he\nhad been reading another work of Taine's that morning, and only thought\nof a page and line ;\nyet words were written from that line of another page\nof the book. Again, in Sitting XVI., Miss Symonds has three book experi-\n\f36 Jouriial of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., 1893.\nments, choosing a different book each time, she says \"at random.\" Yet\npassages or words from two of these books were written, in one case from\nthe page and line chosen ; and in the third case it was written that theie\nwas no such page, which was correct. Of these three exjjeriments, also, no\nexplanation or suggestion of any kind is offered.\nIn what is called the \" Sitting for Materialisation,\" a confederate entered\nthe room, and was enabled to do so by the complete darkness. I liave wit-\nnessed numerous far better materialisation-phenomena in private houses,\nunder circumstances which rendered the presence of a confederate impossible\nand on none of these occasions was there darkness, but always light enough\nto allow all the persons in the room to be seen. The accounts of the sitters\nwith Mr. Davey as to the locking and sealing of the door were so grossly\ninaccurate that I was led to suppose the phenomena were genuine.\nI think I have now shown that there are very great differences between\nMr. Davey's jjerformances and those of mediums. This would have been of\nlittle importance had not his seances been given undue prominence by\npublication in tlie Society's Proceedings, and been thenceforth appealed to as\nproving that the slate- writing of mediums was also trickery. Mr. Davey's\nrepeated refusal to exhibit his performances to those Si^iritualists who had\nhad a large experience of slate-writing in the presence of mediums, should,\nin my opinion, have been sufficient to exclude his jjaper from the pages of a\nscientific journal, since he thereby proved that to elicit the truth in tlie\nmatter was not so mucli his object as to keep up his reputation as an\nexposer of the tricks of mediums. The comparatice experiments, which\ncould alone have given any scientific value to his performances, being absent,\nnothing remains to interest Spiritualists beyond clever conjuring inter-\nmingled with more or less of psychical or mediumistic power.\nI venture to liope that other Spii'ltualists may now make known their\nexperiences of slate-writing phenomena, under conditions very different\nfrom those present during Mr. Davey's jjerformances, and such as to exlude\nthe agencies he mainly employed. Alfred R. Wallace.\nREPLY TO MR. ALFRED UUSSEL WALLACE.\n(To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir, \u2014I must confess my surjirise \u2014after the various articles relating more\nor less to slate-writing which have appeared in our Proceedings and Journal,\nbeginning with Mrs. Sidgwick's paper read on May 3rd, 1886, and published\nin Part X. of our Proceedings {Yol. IV., p. 45) and ending with my article in\nPart XXII., \u2014to find Mr. Wallace still affirming that \"the important question\nis, whether the methods which Mr. Davey used in his trick-performances\nare such as will serve to explain most, or all, of the slate-writing of pro-\nfessional mediums.\" It is difficult to conceive a greater misapprehension of\nthe point at issue. The chief object of the investigation with Mr. Davey\nwas to estimate the true worth of testimony to \" psychographic \" and\nsimilar performances, \u2014\"to ascertain by definite experiment, what sort of\nrepjrts honest and intelligent persons will make of conjuring performances\n\fMar., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 37\ncarried out in private, without any advantage of conditions, and directed to\nobtaining results as closely as possible resembling those on which\nSpiritualists rely.\" (Froceedings, Vol. IV., Part XI., p. 380.) In the\nIntroduction to Mr. Davey's Experimental Investigation I tried to show in\ndetail how far other records of psychographic jihenomena \"might be\nmisdescriptions, and what were the chief causes of the misdescriptions.\" It\nwas also pointed out clearly, in describing tlie object of the notes attached\nto the reports of sittings, that\n\"to explain the tricks would in itself be of little advantage to the\ninvestigator of the '\nphysical phenomena '\nof mediums, since many\nmethods of producing '\npsychography '\nmay exist besides those\nwhich Mr. Davey has employed ; and were all of those in present\nuse to be made public projDerty, others would doubtless be\ninvented, and accidental opjoortunities for producing successful\nillusions would still arise \";\n\u2014\nthat it would be a great mistake\n'\n' to sujipose that explanations of the methods in use would convince\nthose who have te.stified from personal experience to the genuine-\nness of the '\npsychography '\nof Eglinton, Slade, etc. , that such\nmethods were used for the production of the phenomena which\nthey witnessed. They will scarcely be likely to remember the\noccurrence of events which they jjerhaps never observed at all,\nor observed only partially and erroneously ;\nwhich, whether\ncorrectly or incorrectly observed, they have afterwards con-\ntinually misdescribed or completely forgotten ; and which, in\nmany cases, would be distinctly excluded by the acceptance of\ntheir testimony as it stands\" ;\n\u2014\nand that the object of the notes was\n\"to show to investigators the kind and degree of mistakes which\nmay be made by educated and intelligent witnesses in recording\ntheir impression of a performance tlie main lines of which are\nplanned with the deliberate intention of deceiving them, but few,\nif any, of the details of which can V)e described as absolutely\nfixed.\"\nAfter such explicit declarations as the above, repeated and emphasised\nin a variety of ways both in the Journal and in the Proceedings by Mrs.\nSidgwick and myself, during the discussions on the subject in 1886-7, and\nreiterated in my article in Part XXII., where I have again drawn special\nattention throughout to the fact that the important point to notice is not\nhow the trick was done, but what kinds of errors appear in the report of\nthe witness, \u2014after all this, I say, I am astonished to find Mr. Wallace still\ncompletely missing the point of the whole investigation. The obviously\nimportant question for him to ask is : What hiiuh of mistakes may I expect\nto find in my onyn reports of \" psychographic \" phenomena? and not the\nquestion which he practically does ask, viz., Assuming my reports to be\ncorrect, how can Mr. Davey's methods explain the slate -loriting n^hich I\nwitnessed ? This last question is of no importance whatever. The investi-\ngation with Mr. Davey establishes that the assumption of the correctness of\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mae., 1893.\nrecords of the kind under consideration is an absurd assumption. If we\ncould get \"behind the scenes\" in all of Mr. Wallace's experiences, we\nmight find that nearly every differential circumstance which he enumerates\nwas present at one or other of his sittings. ^ In spite of Mr. Wallace's belief\nto the contrary, it is possible that the medium may have left the room, the\nslates may have been put under the table, there may have been a duster\nand a blotting paper, there may have been a long waiting, he may have\nbeen in the room an hour before the sitting began, other experiments\nmay have been interpolated, and the sitters may have been asked to\nchange places. There are misdescriptions of all these points in the\nreports of the sittings with Mr. Davey, and I may add here that mis-\ndescrijitions of a similar character were demonstrated to occur in the\nrecords of sittings with Eglinton (vide Journal, Oct. -Dec. 1886). If\nthen, in the light of the reports of Mr. Davey's performances, supple-\nmented by the explanations given of tlie misdescriptions in those reports,\nwe ask the really important question what kinds of mistakes we should\nexpect to find in Mr. Wallace's and other similar reports of \" p.sycho-\ngraphic \" jjhenomena, we have to reply that although as the events are\ndescribed trickery is not a sufficient explanation of the writing, it is a\nsufficient explanation of the writing when we correct the record as we are\nentitled to do ; when allowance is made for the same kind and amount of\nmisdescription as we have proved to occur in tlie accounts of Mr. Davey's\n1 Mr. Wallace's No. 1 is curious. One might almost suppose that he regards it as a\nspecial glory to have, very nearly, succeeded in never trying any slates but the medium's.\nHe apparently wishes to emphasise the circumstance that Mr. Davey had a great\nadvantage when he got his sitters to bring three slates, and of course it is easier to\nplay tricks with three slates than with two or one. On the other hand it is surely\nmore satisfactory to get writing on one's own slates than on those of the medium, the\nlatter being so much more easily prepared beforehand, as were probably the ^' sfi'cn\nslates filled with writing or portraits \" which Mr. Wallace got from Fred Evans. The\nonly detailed (!) account by Mr. Wallace of a psychographic performance which I can\nremember appearing in our publications was quoted by Mr. Massey in Proceedings,\nPart X. (Vol. IV., p. 84.) The medium was Monck (a detected trickster), and\neven in Mr. Wallace's account it appears that four slates were on the table. It would\nbe interesting to know at how many of Mr. Wallace's sittings he believed that there\nwere fewer than three .slates, and by what kind of search he believes liimself to have\nascertained this.\nMr. Wallace thinks tliat it would be liarder ior the medium to trick when some of\nthe persons present are sitting away from the taljle instead of being at the table.\nThis depends largely on the trick, on the exact positions of the persons, and various\nother circumstances. \"A yard back \" would usually be a much worse position than at\nthe table, especially if the actual sitter came between the onlooker and the medium.\nIn nearly all slate-writing tricks, I think, for purposes of detection, I would rather be\nas near to the \" medium \" as possible. At a sitting with a Mrs. Gillett, wliere I sat\nabout \" three yards off,\" while a friend sat at the table for a sitting, I saw practically\nnothing from my position, whereas when I was sitting at the table myself I saw all\nher chief trick movements. (I gave an account of these in the Rcligio-Philo-\nsophical Journal, February 13th, 1892.) The other points of the nine which, Mr.\nWallace enumerates I have quite sufficiently dealt with above. Most of them are\nfallacious from other points of view, as will doubtless readily be seen by any reader of\nthe reports who is at all familiar with the performances of professional mediums.\n\fMar., 180.3.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 39\nperformances, the \" inediumistic phenomena \" in dispute are perfectly explic-\nable by conjuring.\nBesides Mr. Wallace's complete general misconception of the point at\nissue, I find a special misconception in his acceptance now of the challenge\nin my article more than four years ago tliat the \" experienced Spiritualist\"\nshould point out exactly where the difference lies between Mr. Davey's\nperformances and mediumistic phenomena. Surely the meaning of this\nchallenge was obvious ? Wlioever accepted it was to compare the reports of\nMr. Davey's performances with the reports of mediumistic phenomena, and\ngive satisfactory reasons for holding that tlie one set of phenomena were\nexplicable by conjuring and the other set not ;\nor, as Mrs. Sidgwick put the\nquestion (Jon.nMl for July, 1887, p. 138): if he was able to distinguish\nconjuring performances from mediumistic ones, he had \"an opportunity of\nshowing it by explaining exactly how, if the accounts of Mr. Davey's\nperformances and Mr. Eglinton's [or Monck's, or Slade's, or Keeler's, or\nEvans'] were presented to him for the first time mixed up and so that he did\nnot know which was which, he would distinguish the genuine from the\nspurious.\" Mr. Wallace and other believers in the genuineness of\npsychography had four years in which to accept this challenge. So far as I\nam aware, no attempt was ever made to meet it. On the contrary, as\nappears from Mr. Wallace's letter printed in the Journal in March, 1891, he\nand others substantially confessed that they were unable to make the\ndistinction demanded, and that they believed Mr. Davey to be a medium.\nEven now, indeed, Mr. Wallace thinks it probable that Mr. Davey\npossessed \"mediumistic power,\" a, term which he distinguishes from\n\"thought-reading and thought-impressing,\" and by which I suppose he\nmust mean the power of obtaining so-called \"independent writing.\" I\nmust confess that if what I have already said in the Proceedings and the further\ncomments which I wish to make here on other but related points are not\nsufficient to convince Mr. Wallace that Mr. Davey was not a \" medium,\" it\nseems to me unprofitable to say any more on the subject. As the matter\nstands, Mr. Wallace still makes no distinction between Mr. Davey's\nperformances and the disputed mediumistic phenomena. To make this\ndistinction, he must give satisfactory reasons for accepting the testimony to\nmediumistic phenomena as valid, while rejecting the testimony to Mr.\nDavey's phenomena as invalid. He gives no such reasons, and makes no\nattempt whatever to compare the testimonies in the two classes of\nperformances alleged by him to be different. Why, for example, should I\nreject the statement of Mrs. Y. \u2014\" I am perfectly confident that my hand\nwas not removed from the slates for one single instant, and that I never lost\nsight of them for a moment \"\u2014as positively erroneous, and accept Mr.\nWallace's statement that \" any substitution was simply impossible \" as\nabsolutely reliable ? Mr. Wallace wants to get \"behind the scenes \" for one\nset of records and sit in the gallery for the other !\nAnd let me here remind the reader that a similar conclusion as to\nthe unreliability of the testimony to \"slate-writing\" performances might\nhave been obtained by an investigation of the results of conjuring\nperformances of another kind altogetlier. We should have reached the\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mak., is93.\nsame general conclusions concerning the untrustworfchiness of testimony\nwherever the possibility of a conjurer's operations had to be allowed for,\nthough the criterion would then have been less easy of ajjplication than it is\nnow, owing to the close resemblance in all fundamental respects which\nthe reports of Mr. Davey's performances bear to the accoimts of those of\nprofessional mediums.\nMr. Wallace complains of Mr. Davey's \" refusal to exhibit his perform-\nances to those Spiritualists who had had a large experience of slate-writing\nin the presence of mediums.\" Well, had the contemplated series of\nexperiments to which I referred in Proceedings^ Part XXII., p. 254, been\ncarried out, I have no doubt that some \" experienced Sjoiritualists \" would\nbe now affirming more strongly than ever tliat Mr. Davey was a wonderful\nmedium, though they probably would not have known him under the\nname of Mr. Davey. For differences between reports of sittings with\na person known beforehand to be a professed conjurer, and reports of\nsittings with a person regarded as a medium, see the Jonmal for October,\n1886, pp. 410, 411 ; and as regards the supposition which I take to be\nimplied in Mr. Wallace's remarks, that \" experienced Spiritualists \" would\nhave been less easily deceived than were Mr. Davey's sitters, there are good\nreasons for thinking that \"the presumption is strongly the other way.\"\n(Part XL, p. 404.)\nSo much, then, for the main point at issue, which is not whether\nthe methods used by Mr. Davey will serve to explain most or all of the\nslate-writing of professional mediums, but whether\u2014to vary the mode of\npresenting the point\u2014when the reports of such slate-writing are duly corrected\nfor their possible misdescriptions, the phenomena are explicable by con-\njuring.\nThere are now one or two subsidiary points which it may be worth while\nto clear up, if possible, concerning Mr. Wallace's opinion that Mr. Davey\npossessed some supernormal faculty.\nA. Mr. Wallace states that it seems clear to him that Mr. Davey\n\"possessed the faculty of thought-reading and thought-impressing in a high\ndegree.\" Now, at the time of my investigation with Mr. Davey I considered\nthe instances which Mr. Davey adduced in support of his idea that he had\nmore success in guessing numbers, etc., than could be attributed to mere\nchance, and I concluded that he much over-estimated his successes. My\nknowledge of tlie circumstances is of course less now than then when it\nincluded a knowledge of sittings with Mr. Davey, which were never reported\nat all, but it may be worth while to consider the cases that occur in the\ndetailed accounts given in the Proceediiujs and to ask ourselves whether Mr.\nWallace's assertion can be justified.\nLet us first look at the book-experiments. Mr. Wallace says: \"He\ncalculates on forcing a sitter to choose the book he requires. The record of\nhis sittings shows that he tried this experiment with ten different sitters ;\nwith four it failed or was inconclusive, but with the other six it succeeded\nmore or less completely.\" Mr, Wallace's analysis of the experiments is not\n\fMar., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nquite correct,! but it would be superfluous to enter into a detailed calculation\nof chances where the question is one of forcing, of the principle of which,\nas used in various forms by conjurers, Mr. Wallace appears to be entn-ely\nignorant. In Part XXII., pp. 268-270, I have given a detailed description\nof the two instances in which Mr. Davey arranged a \" force \" among my\nown books ; and it is amazing to find Mr. Wallace suggesting that thought-\ntransference is involved in the success achieved in \"forcing \" a book under\nthe circumstances of Mr. Davey's sittings, where probably not one of the\n\u2022sitters knew any more about \" forcing \" than Mr. Wallace does. I have\nfrequently forced a card \"several times running\" on the same person, in\nthe same way. Doubtless Mr. Wallace would have regarded this as evidence\nof thought-transference. He unconsciously but persistently continues to\nignore a fundamental part of the conjuring performance. I have already\nindicated in the case of Miss Y. (Part XXII., p. 2G9) how she was led into\nchoosing the required book partly from her very desire to take a book at\nrandom, not to inspect titles and make a reflective choice. I have shown\nhow little dependence can be placed on the after-impression of the witness\nthat the book was chosen strictly at random, pointing out clearly, as I\nthought, how it was forced upon her by the conjurer ;\nyet Mr. Wallace\nquotes Miss Symons as using the phrase \" at random \" (as she does for only\n1 The ten sitters to whom Mr. Wallace refers are apparently the following, R\nsignifying auccesB and W faihn-e :\n\u2014\n1. Sitting II. Miss Y R\n2. ,, IV. Mr. Padahah W\n3. \u201e V. Mr. Block W\n4. ,, VI. Mr. Ten Bruggenkate R\n5. \u201e VII. Mr. Manville W\nG. ,, VII. Mr. Pinnock R\n7. \u201e VIII.

Miss Symons R\nNow, in the first place it should be noticed that prior to the successes with Miss Y.\nthere were three failures, Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Y. having each taken a book, not\nthe one required. Mrs. Sidgwick, as she explains in ProceC'liiigs, Pai-t XXII., p. 272,\nfailed several times to take the right book, and took the right one finally because she\nperceived that Mr. Davey wanted that one. This, therefore, counts as a failure. On\nthe other hand, Miss Symons chose three different books, two of which can be counted\nas right. (I omit the third book, since this was a Journal or Proceidings S.P.R.\nand the message \"no such page\" was apparently written after its choice. It was\ndoubtless known to Mr. Davey that the current number of the Journal or Proceedings\ncontained no page under 10, and in any odd part of the Journal or Proceedings the\nchances are of course that tlie answer \"no such page \" would be correct. ) This analysis\ngives fourteen trials and shows eight failures and six successes. Probably we should\nhave to diminish e\\'en this percentage of success if we knew in every detail exactly\nwhat occurred at the sittings, e.g., Miss Symons may have chosen one or two other\nbooks before she took the right one, and Mr. Davey may have objected to these on the\ngrounds that he had read them, etc. Here, again, Mr. Wallace's estimate is open to\nerror because of his assumption that the reports are accurate. And I refer him\nespecially to the Journal for October, 1880, pp. 419-421, where I have pointed out\njust such an omission from the recox'd of a sitting with Eglinton as I here suggest in\nMiss Symons' account of her choice of a book. UnreliabiUty of testimony again.\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Map., 1893.\none of the three book experiments) ; he apparently supposes that she is\ngiving an accurate account of what actually occurred, and cannot understand\nthat the book may have been forced upon her in much the same way as the\nbook was forced upon Miss Y. Mr. Wallace's notion of the difficulty of\nforcing is as naive as his judgments about conjuring performances generally.\nFurther, he seems to think tliat there is only one method of forcing a book,\nnamely, that particular method which I described in detail. There are\nmodifications of \" conspicuous forcing \" and modifications of \" inconspicuous\nforcing.\" For examj^le, the conjurer moves with the sitter towards the\nshelves: \"Take any book at random. Don't take a book that anybody\nwould take \"\u2014toucliing a very conspicuous book, with a slight wave of the\nhand further to the right, which helps to lead the eye of the sitter to an\ninsignificant looking book in an obscure position\u2014just the book required.\nI repeat that it is manifestly Mr. Wallace's ignorance of conjuring that\nallows him to suppose tliat Mr. Davey's success in forcing the right book was\nany indication of thought-transference. The only case in my opinion that\ndeserves any consideration from this point of view is that of Mr. Dodds.\nIt was a \"curious coincidence\" that Mr. Davey should have placed, in a\nforcing position, a book by the same author as one which Mr. Dodds had\nbeen so recently reading. But we do not know what other books Mr. Dodds\nhad been reading that day, and for every additional book that he had been\nreading, the oddity of the coincidence is diminished. Conscious reasoning,\nI believe, so far as Mr. Davey was aiimre, led him to choose the book as a\nlikely one for Mr. Dodds to take if it should catch his eye. The \"force\"\nperhaps consisted of a slight displacement of the book, or the book may\nhave been somewhat larger than those in its neighbourhood. Now it was\nthe \"force \" doubtless which originally drew the attention of Mr. Dodds to\nthis book. Wliether lie would have finally chosen it had he not been so\nrecently reading another book by the same author we cannot tell. But he\nwas consciously influenced to choose it by his remembrance of the aforesaid\nreading. Be it observed, therefore, that the remarkable thing is not that\nMr. Dodds chose tliat book, but that Mr. Daoeij chose it, and from this\npoint of view the reader will see that the case is less remarkable than Mr.\nWallace seems to think. If the incident was telejjathic, Mr. Dodds was\nprobably the unconscious agent earlier in the day, and Mr. Davey the\npsrcipient, and at the time of the supposed tliouglit-transference they had\nnever met. It is, if telepathic, an unusual type of case, and can hardly be\nclaimed as a prcjof of thought-transference in Mr. Davey's experience unless\nwe find further evidence distinctly pointing in this direction. Let us then\nturn to Mr. Davey's selections of numbers and figures. The following table\nrepresents all the cases in the detailed reports of experiments in the\ndrawing of figures.\nSittinif.

My remembrance about this incident is that when Mr. Davey\nassured me {vide Part XI., Vol. IV., p. 489) that he intended to draw a cross,\nI conjectured that he had inferred what the figure was from possibly hearing\nMiss Y. draw it, but that he explained that he had not heard the sound of\nthe drawing, but had heard Miss Y.'s whispered reply ''cross\" to her\nmother's whispered query as to the figure chosen. This, again, is another\ninstance of Mr. Wallace's mistake in assuming that the reports are accurate.\nThe following table represents all the cases in the detailed reports of\nexperiments with simple numbers, \u2014choice being limited to muler 10.\nSitting.

If it is either 4 or 7 you exhibit to him a piece of paper\nupon which you have previously written a number which is 4 from one\npoint of view but turned the other way is 7. Here I must confess that\nI am somewhat surprised at the implication which Mr. Wallace reads in my\nwords. Mr. Wallace says that Mr. Davey evidently calculated on the faculty\n(of thought-transference) \"for Mr. Hodgson tells us that he draws a figure\nor number that he thinhs the sitter is most likely to choose.\" I most\nassuredly was not thinking of thought-transference when I wrote :\n\u2014\n\" While he is juaking a little heap of the chalks on the middle of the\nslate, before placing the tumbler in position, he also draws a figure\n(or a number, as the case may be) that he thinks the sitter is\nmost likely to choose.\"\nI was thinking of Mr. Davey's estimate of the sitter, the conversation, the\nsurroundings, etc. Thus, Mr. Davey might conclude that one sitter would\nprobably choose a very simple figure, such as a square or a triangle, and\nthat another sitter would probably avoid choosing a very simple figure.\nUsually, indeed, Mr. Davey did not ask the sitter to think of a figure till\nafter the chalks and tumbler had been placed in position and the figure had\nbeen drawn.\n\fJournal of Societi\/ for Psychical Research.

Mr.\nDavey had written passages from pp. 3-9 inclusive. ^ This case, therefore,\nmay be dropjjed from our calculation. There remain five cases, in only one\nof which was the page correct, and in two of these wrong cases there were,\nso to say, two guesses.\nTurning now to the line numbers, I find that in Sitting II. Mr. Davey\nhad written passages from lines 1, 8, and 9, thereby increasing threefold his\nchance of getting one line right. In the remaining five cases, the line was\napparently completely wrong in three cases (in one of which, moreover,\nthere were two guesses, and in the other three guesses\u2014apparently all\nwrong) and partially right in two cases. I say partially riglit because in\nSitting VIII. the line 8 was chosen by the sitter, \u2014and not only line 8 but\nseveral succeeding lines had also been written by Mr. Davey, \u2014 while for Sit-\nting XVI. he had written words from line 1 as well as from line 5. ^ It must\nbe I'emembered, further, that the numbers selected by Mr. Davey were not\nchosen strictly at random, and therefore that tlie question of number-habit\ncannot be excluded from the calculation. Further still, there may have been\nother lines quoted on the slate unknown U) the sitter, just as there were in\nSitting II. Taking, however, even the most favourable view possible of all\nthese groups of cases thus regarded as experiments in Thought-transference,\nthe reader may well be surprised that it \"seems clear \" to Mr. Wallace that\ni\nThe title of the poem on page 3 of the book chosen [A Selection from the Poetry\nof E. B. Broxoniwj. Hecoml Series.) is repeated as a headhne on pp. 4-7. The title\nof the poem on p. 8 is repeated as a headline on p. 9.\n- In this case, Mr. Davey had been informed by the sitter what page and line she\nhad chosen and in three other cases he had arranged with the sitters that they should\nchoose numbers under ten.\n\fMae., 1893.] Joiiviial of Society for Psychical Research. 45\nMr. Ddvey \"possessed the faculty of thought-reading and thought-impress-\ning in a high degree.\" We shall rather be content at the most with Mr.\nDavey's more sober judgment expressed in connection with the \"98\"\nincident (Part XI., p. 413, footnote). \"This may, of course, have been\nmerely an odd coincidence, but the fact that I have had several somewhat\nsimilar experiences with other investigators led me to think that there might\nbe something of the nature of thought-reading in it.\"\nIn connection with this I sliould quote another statement made by\nMr. Davey (Part XI., p. 486)\n\"In some of my earlier experiments I believed that there were\nindications of thought-transference between jnyself and my\nsitters. My later sittings have oflered no sujjport to this view,\nbut, owing partly to my inexperience, I laboured sometimes\nunder considerable nervous excitement in my earlier sittings,\nand I have not felt this latterly. This may have conduced to\nwhat occasionally seemed to me to be a certain amount of com-\nmunity of thought between my sitters and myself, and I hope at\nsome time to make a special series of experiments for the purpose\nof ascertaining whether my conjecture is well-founded or nut.\"\nTo return to the incident in Sitting VII., which Mr. Wallace specially\ninstances, I give my not very clear remembrance of the case for what it is\nworth. It is at any rate one of the explanations obvious to any person at\nall familiar with \"forcing\" tricks. Page 12 and line 8 were chosen\u2014by\nthe sitters I No ; \u2014by Mr. Davey. First look at the two accounts :\n\u2014\nMr. Manville writes (p. 456) :\n\u2014\n\" I took a pinch of crayons from a box, Mr. Pinnock doing the same.\nOn counting, mine came to 6, Mr. Pinnock 's came to 11, Mr.\nVenner's came to -S. Mr. P. and I divided Mr. V. \\s, makinsr\nmine 8 and Mr. P.'s 12, so we decided that it should be p. 12,\nline 8.\"\nMr. Venner writes (p. 452) :\n\u2014\n\" The medium requested eacli of us to take a small handful of chalks\nout of the box on the table. Mr. P. took 11, Mr. M. six, and I\nthree. The meditim divided the three chalks I had selected\nbetween the other two. We had previously agreed that Mr. P.'s\nnumber should represent a page, and Mr. M.'s number a line.\"\nNow Mr. Davey had taken care that the box should contain just 20 (12-1-8)\nfragments of chalk. He then, let us suppose, begins by remarking that in\nchoosing numbers for page and line it is well to avoid any possibility of\nthought-transference. The numbers should be taken entirely at random.\n\"Now Mr. P., suppose you take a pinch of these crayons, the number to\nrepresent the page ; take a good pinch, not too many, of course, \u2014leave\nsome for the line ; now Mr. M. ;\n\u2014now Mr. V., suppose you take the rest.\n. . . . 11, 6, and 3. Well, as Mr. V. knows me, Mr. M. had better\nchoose the line and we'll divide Mr. V.'s chalks, 2 to Mr. M. because he has\n\f46 Joiirncd of Society for Psychical Research. [Mak., is'j3.\ntlie smaller number, and 1 to Mr. P. So we get \u2014how many ? 12 for the\npage and 8 for the line, \u2014chosen m a purely haphazard way.\" In this\nconnection I refer the reader to my discussion of the records of a sitting\nwith Eglinton, printed in the Journal for October, 1886, pp. 418-421, and to\nthe remarks by Mr. Lewis (\" Professor Hoffmann\") in the Journal for\nAugust, 1886, p. 370 :\n\" The expedient of taking a number of bibs of pencil,\nwax lights, or tlie like, though apparently excluding the possibility of\nprearrangement, is caj^ialjle of a good deal of '\nmanagement ' in skilful\nhands.\"\nB. Another point in Mr. Wallace's letter that calls for some comment is\nthe statement referring to the \"involuntary movements\" by which Mr.\nDavey found himself affected during his first experiments in the investiga-\ntion of Spiritualism. Mr. Wallace really almost seems to be arguing that\nbecause certain mediumistic plienomena are attended with '\n' involuntary\nmovements,\" therefore \"involuntary movements\", are apro of of medium-\nship. Mr. Davey says, concerning these \" involuntary movements \" that he\nafterwards had '\n' little doubt they were caused simply by nervous\nexcitement.\" He tells us more than this, in a passage which seems to have\nescaped the notice of Mr. Wallace. He says (Part XL, p. 407, the next\npage to that from which Mr. Wallace quotes) :\n\" During seances held jjrivately, T continued to be frequently seized\nby spasmodic movements when I believed '\nuncanny ' manifesta-\ntions were about to take jjlace. As a conjurer, I have been siiice\namused sometimes at similar convulsions in others during my\nconjuring performances, when the sitters ha\\'e sujjposed that the\nwriting was being produced by supernatural means ;\nmy own\nshuddering:; durinij these performances hehuj, of course, imrt of the\ntrich.\"\nI have now dealt with all tlie cases to whicli Mr. Wallace has made any\nspecific reference in the preceding letter. In my article in Proceedings,\nPart XXII., I had already explained in detail all the cases which Mr.\nWallace mentioned specifically in his letter printed in the Journal for\nMarch, 1891, as being presumably the most difficult of explanation. I am\nnot aware of any other experiments recorded in the detailed reports, which\nare not so similar to those already explained that any intelligent reader can\neasily see for himself how they were performed. Whatever difficulty Mr.\nWallace finds in understanding Mr. Davey's performances doubtless arises\nfrom the strange inability which he has shown to appreciate the main object\nof our investigations with Mr. Davey. Pie still apparently assumes that the\nstatements of the witnesses are reliable instead of allowing for misdescrip-\ntions like those which I have so frequently and so variously pointed out.\nHe goes on further to make, about his own experiences, certain statements\nwhich the investigations with Mr. Davey jjrove to be unreliable. Mr.\nWallace says, \u2014I repeat tlie quotation :\n\u2014\" The important question is, whether\nthe methods which Mr. Davey used in his trick-performances are such as\nwill serve to explain most, or all, of the slate-writing of professional\nmediums.\" On the contrary, I say again, this is not the important question.\n\fMill., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 47\nAs I have said in Part XXII. (p. 279) :\u2014\" The question of primary\nimportance concerns the value of human testimony under the circumstances\ninvolved. Why do we not accept such testimony ? Because it is\ndemonstrably fallible in precisely those particular points where it must be\nshown infallible before the phenomena can be accejjted as supernormal. \" It\nhas been shown conclusively, for example, that\u2014under the circumstances\ninvolved, \u2014intelligent and hand fide witnesses may affirm positively that a\nparticular slate never left their sight, whereas in truth it did leave their\nsight, and ample opportunity was given for the conjurer to write upon it liy\nordinary means. Hence when Mr. Wallace states that in one of his\nexperiences writing was obtained upon a slate of his own \"without its\nleaving my sight or that of my brother,\" the statement has very little\nevidential value.\nSimilarly, there is little evidential value in his statement : \"I examined\ntwo slates, tied them together, placed my hand upon them on the table,\nthe medium placing his hand on mine, and in a minute or two I opened\nthe slates and found several lines of writing inside. Nothing else whatever\nhappened, and any substitution was simply impossible.\" Various instances\nof just this type of statement occur in the reports of Mr. Davey's\nsittings, and I have discussed several of them in Part XXII. (See pp. 261,271,\n281.)\nWe now know that under the circumstances involved, human testimony\nis so fallible as to be untrustworthy for the demonstration required, and\nthat such statements as that of Mr. Wallace just quoted must be regarded\nas probably misdescriptions, and as practically worthless for proving any\nsui^ernormal phenomena.\nOnce more and finally, the important question is not one of how\nparticular tricks are done \u2014or whether Mr. Davey's tricks in whole or in part\nare the same as those of alleged mediums, \u2014the important question concerns\nthe value of testimony where, in addition to the ordinary sources of error,\n\"the possibility of an exceptionally disturbing influence has to be allowed\nfor\u2014to wit, the influence of a person skilled in particular forms of deception,\nwhose chief object is to prevent the witnesses from perceiving many of the\nactual occurrences, and to persuade them, by ingenious illusions, to an\nerroneous belief concerning others.\" {Juvrnal for Jan., 1887, p. 5.) The\nobject of the investigation with Mr. Davey, as explicitly and repeatedly pointed\nout in our Jofirnal and our Proccedimjs, was to obtain some criterion as to the\nvalue of testimony under such circumstances . The result of the investiga-\ntion shows that the sort of testimony hitherto 6fi\"ered in favour of the\ngenuineness of so-called \" psychography \" is worthless. The testimony is\nvitiated by the non-exclusion of possibilities of mal-observation and lapse\nof memory. And no testimony can be regarded as having any claim to\nserious consideration until such possibilities are excluded.\nJamtcmj 2Uh, 1893.

W. H. Myers gave an address on \" Motoi\" Messages from the\nSubliminal Self,\" the substance of which will appear in the next num-\nber of the Proceedings. He pointed out that besides the definite\nsensory messages already dealt with, there were a great variety of mani-\nfestations of the subliminal consciousness in the form of movements,\neither vague and unspecialised, or specialised as writing or speech. He\ncited some of Dr. Gibotteau's experiments with his subject (or rather\nagent) Berthe, as the only examples yet received of successful telepathic\naction upon the percipient's sense of direction, or general motor cajDacity,\nHe went on to cite various automatically written messages, especially\nof Miss A.'s, discussing the degree of verification which they had\nreceived, and the canons of evidence which should help towards a clearer\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1893.\nview as to the origin o\u00a3 retrocognitive messages in general,\u2014whether\nthey should be attributed to the action of external intelligences, or to\nthe subliminal powers of the automatist's own spirit.\nMr. Podmore then read a paper on \"Telepathic Dreams.\" He began\nby pointing out that the evidence for telepathy afforded by dream-coinci-\ndences is weaker than that derived from waking impressions, (1) because\nof the greater frequency of dreams ; (2) because of the vague and\nelusive character of the dream-impression ; (3) because dreams have no\nlandmarks either in time or space. The last two sources of error did\nnot seriously affect dreams which were mentioned or noted in writing-\nbeforehand. As regards the first point, it was important to observe\nthat coincident dreams presented very generally some exceptional\nfeatures, such as extreme vividness, realism, or coherence, or left behind\na painful impression, which persisted in the waking hours. Theoreti-\ncally, dreams were of importance as presenting us with examples of\nhallucinations in miniature, in which many of the characteristic\nfeatures of hallucination could be studied.\nMr. Podmore then proceeded to quote examples of the principal\ntypes of veridical dreams, pointing out as he did so their chief\nevidential features.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nG. 233.\nThe following is a case of so-called \" haunting \"\u2014inexplicable noises\nl^eing constantly heard by the tenants of the house during an occu-\npancy of about 6 J- years, and unrecognised phantasms being seen three\ntimes, on one occasion collectively, while some time earlier a figure,\nwhich was said to have some resemblance to the late master of the\nhouse, had been seen there by one of his old servants. A similar case\n\u2014that of the \" Haunted House at Willington \"\u2014was printed in the\nJournal, December, 1892, and though the present one is even more\nremote, it has the same merit of having been fully and carefully\nrecorded at the time by exceptionally intelligent and trustworthy\nwitnesses.\nFor the loan of the pamphlet here reprinted, we are indebted to\nthe Marquis of Bute, whose comments on the narrative are appended.\n* '\n# * * *\nMary Ricketfcs was the youngest child of Swynfen .Jervis, Esq., and\nElizabeth Parker, his wife. She was born at Meaford, near Stone, in\nStaifordshire, in 1737-8. From her early childhood she evinced a love for\nreading, and an aptitude for mental improvement, which were developed by\nthe wise training of Nicholas Tindal, the learned continuer of Rapin's His-\ntory of England.\nHer veracity was proverbial in the family. Her favourite brother and\n\fAi'RiL, 1893.] Jowrnal of Society for Psychical Research. 53\ncompanion was John Jervis, who for his distinguislaed naval services was\ncreated Baron Jervis and Earl St. Vincent. Though his junior by three\nyears, she rapidly outstripijed him in book learning, and to lier sui^erior\nacquirements may be traced tlie unwearied pains which John Jervis took to\nmake up for lost time, when, at the age of eighteen, he devoted his spare\nhours to study, instead of sharing in the frivolous amusements of West\nIndian life.\nShe married in 1757 William Henry Ricketts, of Canaan, in Jamaica, Esq.,\nwhose grandfather, William Ricketts, Esq., was a captain in Penn and\nVenables' army at the conquest of Jamaica. Mrs. Ricketts was called upon\nto accompany her husband in his visits to the West Indies, or to remain\nalone in England. Tlie charge of her three infant children determined her to\naccept the latter alternative in 1769.\n*****\nDuring the absence of Mr. Ricketts in Jamaica, his wife continued to\nhdiabit the old Manor House of H , and it was there that the following\nseries of strange disturbances occurred, the effect of which was to render\nher continued occupation of the house an impossibility.\nMrs. Ricketts was a woman (jf remarkable vigour, both physical and\nmental.

Mr. Newbolt.\nH ,\nTVednesdaii Morning, August, 1771.\nMy Dear Sir, \u2014In compliance with my promise to you of yesterday, I\nwould not delay to inform you of the operations of last night. It was\nsettled (contrary to the plan when you left) that John, }ny brother's man,\nsliould accompany Captain Luttrell in the chintz room, and they remain\ntogether till my brother was called. Just after twelve they were disturbed\nwith some of the noises I had frequently lieard and described, and so plainly\nheard by my brother that he quitted his bed long before the time agreed on,\nand joined the other two : the noises frequently proceeding from the garrets,\nthey went up just at break of day, found all the men servants in their proper\napartments, who had heard no disturljance whatever. They examined every\nroom. Everything appeared snug and in place, and, contrary to usual cus-\ntom, the opening and shutting of doors continued (after the other noises\nceased) till five o'clock. My brother authorises me to tell you that neither\nhimself nor Captain Luttrell can account for what they have heard from any\nnatural cause ;\nyet as my brother declares he shall never close his eyes in\nthe house, he and Edward are to watch to-night. At the same time that T\nderive satisfaction in my reports being fully accredited, I am hurt that the\nfew days and nights he hoped to enjoy repose should be passed in the\nutmost embarrassment and anxiety.\nCaptain Jervis to Mr. Ricketts.\nPortsmouth, Augiist dth, 1771.\nThe circumstances I am about to relate to you, dear Sir, require more\naddress than I find myself master of ; it is easy to undertake but difficult to\nexecute a task of this delicate nature. To keep you longer in suspense\nwould be painful. I therefore proceed to tell you H House has been dis-\nturbed by such strange, unaccountable noises from the 2nd of April to this\nday, with little or no intermission, that it is very unfit your family should\ncontinue any longer in it.

You\nwill do me the justice to believe I have, during the short space this event\nhas been made known to me, employed every means in my power to investi-\ngate it.

Mr. Luttrell had tlien no doubt of\nthe cause being beyond the reach of human understanding.\nMy sister having determined on the steps necessary to pursue, of which\nshe will ac(|uaint you, I think her situation ought not to accelerate your\nreturn, at least till you are gi-atitied with proving the utility of the laborious\nalterations you have inade. The strength of judgment, fortitude, and per-\nseverance she has shown upon this very trying occasicni surpass all\nexample, and as she is harassed, not terrified, by this continual agitation, I\nhave no doubt of her health being established the moment she is removed\nfrom the scene of action and impertinent inquiry, or I would risk everything\nto accompany her to the time of your arrival in England ; for which and\nevery other blessing Heaven can bestow you have the constant prayer of\nJ.

In order to corroborate my relation,\nthe captain means to write to you, and I hope his letter will arrive in time\nfor lue to enclose. You may recollect in a letter I wrote about six weeks\nago I mentioned there were some things in regard to H you would not\nfind so agreeable as when you left it, and I added that I could not satisfy\nyour curiosity ; nor did I intend it till you came over, had it been possible\nto have rubbed on till then, but when it was thought alxsolutely necessary\nby my brother and all my friends that were consulted that I should quit the\nplace, and that the reason of it was so publicly known that you must hear it\nfrom other hands, we concluded it much more proper you should receive the\ntruth from us, than a thousand lies and absurdities from others ;\nand much\nwill you feel for what your poor wife has undergone, though I cannot in\nwriting transmit all the jjarticulars.\nOn the 2nd of April last I awoke about two in the morning (observe, I\nlay in the chintz room, having resigned the yellow room to Nurse and Mary)\nand in a few minutes after I heard the sound of feet in the lobby. I listened\na considerable time at the lobby door ; the sound drew near ;\nupon this I\nrang my bell ;\nmy maid came, we searched the room, nothing to be found ;\nRobert was called, and went round with as little success. This appeared to\nme extraordinary, but I should have thought little more of it ; had I not, and\nall the servants in the house, except Sleepy Jack, heard the strangest noises\nof knocking, opening and shutting of doors, talking, explosions, sometimes\nas loud as the bursting of cannon.^\nI kept it to myself, tremendous as it was, except telling Mrs. Newbolt,\ntill four months were almost expired, when, as I was so hurt for want of\nrest, and thought I could not support it much longer, I took the resolution\nto tell my brother, who upon that determined to sit up ;\nCaptain Luttrell\nand his own man with him. The noise was heard in the lobby, and in\ndifferent parts of the house ;\nthey went all over it, every door shut, every\nperson in his room ;\nthey were astonished, and the next morning they both\ndeclared that no house was fit to live in where such noises were heard, and\nno natural cause appeared. You know how much the notion of haunted\nhouses is exploded, and how careful any man would be of asserting it, and\nin that I think them right ; as for myself, I am not afraid or ashamed to\npronounce that it must proceed from a supernatural cause ; but Avhy, except\nas Darby imagines\u2014who passed some days with me\u2014there has been a\nmurder committed that remains yet undiscovered, or for some other wise\npurpose, though not yet manifest? I am at a loss to explain the noises\nincreasing and coming in the daytime. At length I determined quitting the\nplace, and be assured, my dearest life, I did not take this painful step while\nit was possible to continue there ; and I tliank God I am as I am ; the want\nof rest created a little fever on my spirits, which the quiet life I have passed\nwith the Newbolts, and Dr. Walsh's prescription, have removed, so that\nyou need not have the least uneasiness about me. Whatever the cause of\nthese disturbances is, I am sure there has always been something of the\nkind since we have lived here ;\nyou must recollect often hearing the doors open\nand shut below stairs, and your going down sometimes during the night, and\nfinding no person there.

Honoria, the youngest sister of his lady, lived\nAvith them during the life of her sister, and so continued with Lord Y.\ntill her death in 1754. ^\nOn the evening of April 2nd, 1756, Lord Y., sitting alone in the little\npaidour at H , was seized with a lit of apoplexy ; he articulated one\nsentence only to be understood, and continued speechless and insensible\ntill the next morning, when he expired.\nHis lordship's family at the time consisted of the following domestics :\nIsaac M., house steward and bailiff. Sarah P., housekeeper, who had\nlived in the family irear forty years. Thomas P., coachman, husband to\nsaid Sarah, who had lived there upwards of forty years. Elizabeth B.,\nhousemaid, an old servant. Jane D., daii-ymaid. Mary B., cook. Joseph\nS., butler. Joseph, groom. Richard T., gardener, and so continued by\nMr. Ricketts.

On liis death, in August, 1764, Lady Y.,\nso created in her own right, since married to the Earl of H., determined to\nlet H Mansion, and Mr. Ricketts took it in December following. Thomas\nP. was at that time lying dead in the house. His widow and Elizabeth\nB. quitted it on our tidcing possession in January, 17(55. We removed\nthither from town, and liad the same domestics that lived with us there, and\ntill some time afterwards we had not any house-servant lielonging to the\nneighbourhood. Soon after we were settled at H 1 frequently heard noises\nin the night, as of people shutting, or rather slajjping doors with vehemence.\nMr. Ricketts went often round the house on supposition there were either\nhousebreakers or irregularity among his servants. In these searches he\nnever could trace any jjerson ; the servants were in their proper apartments,\nand no appearance of disorder. The noises continued to be heard, and I\ncould conceive no other cause than that some of the villagers had false keys\nto let themselves in and out at pleasure ; the only preventive to this evil\nwas changing the locks, which was accordingly done, yet without the effect\nwe had reasonably expected.\nAbout six months after we came thither, Elizabeth Brelsford, nurse to\nour eldest son, Henry, then about eight months old, was sitting by him\nwhen asleep, iji the room over the pantry, ajipropriated for the nursery,\nand, being a hot summer's evening, the door was open that faces the entrance\n1 A tablet in H Church records that Honoria X. died on November 25th, 1754,\nin the G7tli year of her age.\n\fApril, 1SJ3.

She\nwas in no way surprised at the time, but on the housemaid, Molly Newman,\ncoming up witli her supper, she asked what strange gentleman was come.\nUpon the other answering there was no one, she related wliat is already\ndescribed, and desired her fellow-servant to accompany her to search the\nroom ; this they did immediately without any appearance of what she had\nseen. She was much concerned and disturlDed, and she was thoroughly\nassured she could no ways be deceived, the light being sufficient to distin-\nguish any object clearly. In some time after it was mentioned to me.\n1 treated it as the etfect of fear or superstition, to which the lower class of\npeople are so prone, and it was entirely obliterated from my mind till the\nlate astonishing disturbances brought to my recollection this and other pre-\nvious circumstances.\nIn the autumn of the same year George T , son of the gardener of\nthat name, who was then groom, crossing the great hall to go to bed, saw at\nthe other end a man in a drab-coloured coat, whom he concluded to be the\nbutler, who wore such coloured clothes, he being lately come and his livery\nnot made. As he passed immediately upstairs to the room where all the\nmen servants lay, he was in great astonishment to find the butler and the\nother men servants in bed. Thus the person he had seen in the hall\nremained unaccounted for, like the same person before described by the\nnurse ; and George T , novr living, avers these particulars in the same\nmanner he first related them.\nIn the month of July, 1767, about seven in the evening, there were sitting\nin the kitchen, Thomas Wheeler, postilion ; Ann Hall, my own woman ;\nSarah, waiting woman to Mrs. Mary Poyntz ; and Dame Lacy ; the other\nservants were out excepting the cook, then employed in washing up her\nthings in the scullery.\nThe persons in the kitchen heard a woman come downstairs, and along\nthe passage leading towards them, whose clothes rustled as of the stifl'est\nsilk ; and on their looking that way, the door standing open, a female figure\nrushed past, and out of the house door, as they conceived. Tlieir view of\nher was imperfect ; but they plainly distinguished a tall figure in dark-\ncoloured clothes. Dame Brown, the cook, instantly coming in, this figure\npassed close by her, and instantly disappeared. She described the person\nand drapery as before mentioned, and they all united in astonishment who\nor what this appearance could be ; and their surprise was heightened when\na man, coming directly through the yard and into the house the way she\nwent out, on being asked who the woman was he met, declared he had seen\nno one.\nAnn Hall, since married to John Sparks, now living at Rogate, near\nPetersfield, will testify to the truth of this relation, as will Dame Bro'wn,\nnow living at Bramdean. The postilion is since dead.\nMeanwhile, the noises continued to be heard occasionally. Miss Parker's\nwoman, Susan Maidstone, was terrified with the most dismal groans and\nrustling round her bed. At difi'erent times most of the servants were\nalarmed with noises that could no way be accounted for. In the latter end\nof the year 1769 Mr. Ricketts went to Jamaica ; I continued at H with my\nthree infant children and eight servants, whose names and connections were\nas follows : \u2014Ann Sparks, late Ann Hall, my own woman, the daughter of\nvery industrious parents. Sarah Horner, nurse, sister to a substantial\nfarmer of that name, and of a family of integrity and property. Hannali\nStreeter, imrsemaid, of reputable parents and virtuous principles. Lucy\nWebb, housemaid, of honest principles. Dame Brown, cook, quiet and\n\f60 Jownial of Society fur Ftsycltlcal Re^eavcft. [Afuil, 1893.\nregular. John Sparks, coachman. John Horner, postilion, aged sixteen\nyears, eldest son to the farmer above-mentioned. Lewis Chanson, butler,\na Swiss and of strict integrity. Eichard T ,\ngardener, but did not\nlive in the house.\nI have been thus jjarticular in the descripti(3n of those persons of whom\nmy family was composed, to ]3rove the improbability that ;i set of ignorant\ncountry people, excepting the Swiss alone, should league to cany on a\ndiabolical scheme imijuted to them so injuriously, and which in truth was\nfar beyond the art and reach of man to compass.\nSome time after Mr. Ricketts left me, I\u2014then lying in the bedroom over\nthe kitchen\u2014heard frequently the noise of some one walking in the room\nwithin, and the rustling as of silk clothes against the door that opened into\nmy room, sometimes so loud and of such continuance as to break my rest.\nInstant search being often made, we never could discover any apijearance\nof human or brute being.\nKejjeatedly disturbed in the same manner, I made it my constant practice\nto search the room and closets within, and to secure the only door that led\nfrom that room on the inside in such manner as to be certain no one could\ngain entrance without jjassing through my own apartment, which was always\nmade fast by a di-aw-bolt on the door. Yet this precaution did not preclude\nthe disturbance, which continued with little interruption.\nAbout this time an old man, living in the poor-house at W M ,\ncame and desired to speak to me. When admitted, he told me he could not\nrest in his mind without acquainting me that his wife had often related to\nhim that in her younger days a carpenter, whom she had well known, had\ntold her he was once sent for by Sir Hugh X. , and directed by him to take up\nsome boards in the dining-room, known in our time by the name of lobby,\nand that Sir Hugli had concealed something underneath which he, the car-\npenter, conceived was treasure, and then he was ordered to put down the\nlioards in the same manner as they lay before. This account I repeated to\nMr. Sainsbury, attorney to Lady H., that if he thouglit it were a probability\nhe might have the floor taken up and examined.\nLi February, 1770, John Sparks and Ann, his Avife, quitted my service,\nand went to live upon their fai'm at Rogate. In place of John Sparks I\nhired Robert Camis, one of six sons of Roger and Mary Camis, of the\nparish of H , and whose ancestors have been in possession of a little\nestate there upwards of four hundred ye;irs \u2014a family noted for their moral\nand religious lives. In the room of Ann Sparks I hired Ruth Turpin, but\nshe being disoi-dered in mind continued with me but few months. I then\ntook Elizabeth Godin, of A ,\nsister to an eminent grocer of that place.\nLewis Chans<m quitted me in August, 1770, and I hired Edward Russel, now\nliving with Mr. Harris, of A , to succeed him.\nI jnention these changes among my domestics, though in themselves un-\nimportant, to evince the impossibility of a confederacy, for the course of\nnearly seven years, and with a succession of different persons, no that at the\ntime of my leaving H I had not one servant that lived with me at my\nfirst going thither, nor for some time afterwards.\nIn the summer of 1770, one night that I was lying in the yellow bed-\nchamber (the same I have mentioned that the person in drab-coloured\nclothes was seen to enter), I had been in bed half an hour thoroughly\nawake, and without the least terror or apprehension on my spirits. I plainly\nheard the footsteps of a man, with plodding step, walking towards the foot\nof my bed. I thought the danger too near to ring my bell for assistance,\nbut sprang out of bed and in an instant was in the luu-sery opposite ;\nand\nwith Hannah Streeter and a light I returned to search for wliat I had lieard,\nbut all in vain. There was a light burning in the dressing-room within, as\nusual, and there was no door or means of escape save at the one that opened\n\fApbii,, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.. 61\nto the nursery. This alarm perplexed me more than any preceding, being\nwithin my own room, the footsteps as distinct as ever I heard, myself j^er-\nfectly awake and collected.\nI had, nevertheless, resolution to go to bed alone in the same room, and\ndid not form any conclusion as to the cause of this very extraordinary dis-\nturbance. For some months afterwards I did not hear any noise tliat par-\nticularly struck my attention, till, in November of the same year, I then\nbeing removed to the chintz bedroom over the hall, as a warmer apartment,\nI once or twice heard sounds of harmony, and one night in particular I heard\nthree distinct and violent knocks as given with a club, or something very\nponderous against a door below stairs ; it occurred to me that housebreakers\nmust be forcing into some apartment, and I immediately rang my bell. No\none hearing the summons, and the noise ceasing, I tliought no further of it\nat that time. After this, and in the beginning of the year 1771, I was fre-\nquently sensible of a hollow murmuring that seemed to possess the whole\nhouse ; it was independent of wind, being equally Iieard on the calmest\nnights, and it was a sound I had never been accustomed to hear.\nOn the morning of the 27 th of February, when Elizabeth Godin came\ninto my room, I inquired what weather. She replying in a\" very faint tone,\nI asked if she were ill. She said she was well, but had never in her life\nbeen so terrified as during the preceding niglit ; that she had heard the\nmost dismal groans and fluttering round her bed most part of the night, that\nshe had got up to search the room and up tlie chiuaiey, and though it was a\nbright moonlight she could not discover anything. I did not pay mucli\nattention to her account, but it occurred to me that should anyone tell her\nit was the room formerly occupied by Mrs. P., the old housekeeper, she\nwould be afraid to lie there again. Mrs. P. dying a few days before at K ,\nwas brought and interred in H cliui'chyard tlie evening of the night\nthis disturbance hapjDened.\nThat very day five weeks, being the 2nd of April, I waked between one\nand two o'clock, as I found by my watcli, which, with a rusliliglit, was on a\ntable close to my bedside. I lay thorougldy awake for some time, and then\nheard one or more persons walking to and fro in the lobby adjoining. I got\nout of bed and listened at the door for the space of twenty minutes, in which\ntime I distinctly heard the walking with tlie addition of a loud noise like\npushing strongly against a door. Being thus assured my senses were not\ndeceived I determined to ring my bell, to which I had before much reluct-\nance on account of disturbing the nursery maid, wlio was veiy ill of a fever.\nElizabeth G-odin during lier illness lay in the room with my sons, and\ncame immediately on hearing my bell. Thoroughly convinced there were\npersons in the lobby, before I opened my door, I asked her if she saw no\none there. On her rejjlying in the negative, T went out to her, examined\nthe window, which was shut, looked under the couch, the only furniture of\nconcealment there ; the chimney board was fastened, and when removed,\nall was clear behind it. She found the door into the lobby shut, as it was\nevery night. After this examination I stood in the middle of the room,\npondering with much astonishment, when suddenly the door that opens into\nthe little recess leading to the yellow apartment sounded as if played to and\nfro by a person standing behind it. This was more than I could bear un-\nmoved. I ran into the nursery and rang the bell there that goes into the\nmen's apartments. Robert Camis came to the door at the landing place,\nwhich door was every night secured, so tliat no person coidd get to that flf)or\nuidess through the windows. Upon opening the door to Robert I told him\nthe reason I had to suppose that someone was intrenched behind the door T\nbefore mentioned, and giving him a light and arming him with a billet of\nwood, myself and Elizabeth Godin waited the event. Upon opening the\ndoor there was not any being whatever, and the yellow apartnient was\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, [Apna, 1893.\nlocked, the key hanging up, and a great bolt drawn across the outside door,\nas usual when not in\n\"\nuse. There was then no further retreat or hiding\nplace. After dismissing Robert and securing the door, I went to bed in my\nsons' room, and about half an hour afterwards heard tliree distinct knocks,\nas described before ;\nthey seemed below, but I could not then or ever after\nascertain the place. The next night I lay in my own room ;\nI now and then\nheard noises and frequently the hollow murmur.\nOn the 7th of May, exactly tlie day five weeks from the 2nd of April,\nthis murmur was uncommonly loud. I could not sleep, apprehending it the\nprelude to some greater noise. I got up and went to the nursery, stayed\nthere till half an hour past three, and then, being daybreak, I thought I\nshould get some sleep in my own apartment ; I returned and lay till ten\nminutes before four, and then the great hall door directly under me was slapped\nto with the utmost violence, so as to shake my room perceivably. I jumped\nout of bed to the window that commands the porch. There was light to dis-\ntino-uish every object, but none to be seen that could account for what I had\nheard. Upon examining the door it was found fast locked and bolted as\nusual. . 1 1 \u2022\nFrom this time I determined to have my woman lie in a little bed m my\nroom. The noises grew more frequent, and she was always sensible of the\nsame sounds, and much in the same direction as they struck me. Harassed\nand perplexed, I was yet very unwilling to divulge my embarrassment. I had\n\"\ntaken every method to investigate the cause, and could not discover the\nleast appearance of trick ; on the contrary, I became convinced it was beyond\nth'3 power of any mortal agent to perform, but knowing how exploded such\nopinions were, I kept them in my own bosom, and hoped my resolution\nwould enable me to support whatever might befall.\nAfter Midsummer the noises became every night more intolerable. They\nbegan before I went to bed, and with intermissions were heard till after\nbroad day in the morning. I could frequently distinguish articulate sounds,\nand usually a shrill female voice would begin, and then two others with\ndeeper and manlike tone seemed to join in the discourse, yet, though this\nconversation sounded as if close to me, I never could distinguish words.\nI have often asked Elizabeth Godin if she heard any noise, and of what sort.\nShe as often described the seeming conversation in the manner I have\nrelated, and other noises. One night in particular my bed curtains rustled,\nand sounded as if dragged by a person walking against them. I then asked\nher if she heard any noise and of what kind. She spoke of it exactly in the\nmanner I have done. Several times I heard sounds of harmony within the\nroom\u2014no distinct or regular notes, but a vibration of harmonious tones ;\nwalking, talking, knocking, opening and slapping of doors were repeated\nevery night. My brother, who had not long before returned from the\nMediterranean, had been to stay with me, yet so great was my reluctance^ to\nrelate anything beyond the Ijomids of probability that I could not liring\nmyself to disclose my embarrassed situation to the friend and brother ivho\ncould most essentially serve and comfort me. The noises continuing in the\nsame manner when he was with me, I wished to learn if he heard them, and\none morning I carelessly said : \"I was afraid last night the servants would\ndisturb you, and rang my bell to order them to bed.\" He replied he had\nnot heard them. The morning after he left me to return to Portsmouth,\nabout three o'clock and daylight, Elizabeth Godin and myself both awake-\nshe had been sitting up in bed looking round her, expecting as she always\ndid to see something terrible\u2014I heard with infinite astonishment the\nmost loud, deep, tremendous noise, which seemed to rush and fall with\ninfinite velocity and force on the lobby floor adjoining to my room. I\nstarted up, and called to Godin, \"Good God I did you hear that noise?\" She\nmade no reply ; on repeating the question, she answered with a faltering\n\fApbil,1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. G3\nvoice, She was so frightened she scarce durst speak.\" Just at that in-\nstant we heard a shrill and dreadful shriek, seeming to proceed from under\nthe spot where the rushing noise fell, and repeated three or four times\ngrowing fainter as it seemed to descend, till it sank into earth Hannah\nbtreeter, who lay m the room with my children, heard the same noises and\nwas so appalled she lay for two hours almost deprived of sense and motion\nHaving heard little of the noises preceding, and that little she did not\nregard she liad rashly expressed a wish to hear more of them, and from that\nnight till she (luitted the house tliere was scarce a night past that she did\niiot_ hear the sound as if some person walked towards her door, and pushed\nagainst it, as though attempting to force it open. This alarm, so more than\ncommonly liorrible, determined me to impart the whole series to my brotlier\non his return to H\u2014,\nexpected in a week. The frequency of the noises\nharassing to my rest, and getting up often at unreasonable hours, fixed a slovv\ntever and deep cough, my health was much impaired, but my resolution firm\nI remained m aiixious expectation of my brotlier, and he being detained a\nweek longer at Portsmouth than lie had foreseen, it occurred to me to\nendeavour, by changing my apartment, to obtain a little rest ; I removed to\nthat formerly occupied by Elizabeth Godin ; I did not mention my intention\ntill ten at iiiglit, when the room was prepared, and I went to bed soon after\ni had scarce lam down wlien the same noises surrounded me that I before\nliave related, and I mention the circumstance of changing my room without\nprevious notice, to prove the impossibility of a plan of operations l^einr. so\nsuddenly conveyed to another part of the house were they such as human\nagents could achieve. The week following I was comforted by the arrival of\nmy brother. However desirous to impart the narrative, yet I forbore till\nthe next morning ;\nI wished him to enjoy a night's rest, and therefore con-\nteiitec myself with preparing him to hear on the morrow the most astonish\ning tale that ever assailed his ears, and that he must summon all his trust\nof my veracity to meet my relation. He replied it was scarce possible for\nme to relate any matter he could not believe, little divining the nature of\nwhat I had to offer to his faith.\nThe next morning I began my narrative, to which he attended with\nmixed surpris^e and wonder. Just as I had finished. Captain Luttrell our\nneighbour at K , chancing to call, induced my brother to impart the whole to\nhim, who m a very friendly manner oflered to unite his endeavours to inves-\ntigate the cause. It was then agreed he should come late in the evenino- and\ndivide the^ night watch between them, keeping profoundly secret there was\nany such intention. My brother took the precaution, accompanied by his\nown servant, John Bolton, to go into every apartment, mrticularly those on\nthe farst and attic story, examined every place of concealment, and saw eacli\ndoor fastened, save those to chambers occupied by the family \u2022\nthis done lie\nwent to bed in the room over the servants' hall.\nCaptain Luttrell and my brother's man with arms sat xm in the chmi?\nroom adjoining, and my brother was to be called on any alarm\nI lay that night in Elizabeth Godin's room, and the children in the\nnurseries ;\nthus every chamber on that floor was occupied.

[ApRit, 1893.\nHe said he heard the footsteps of a person walking across the lobby, that\nhe instantly threw the door open, and called, \" Who goes there?\" That\nsomething flitted past him, when my brother directly called out \"Look\nagainst my door.\" He was awake, and heard what Mr. Luttrell had said,\nand also the continuance of the same noise till it reached his door. He arose\nand joined Mr. Luttrell. Both astonished, they heard various other noises,\nexamined everywhere, found the staircase door fast secured as I had left it.\nI lay so near, and had never closed my eyes, no one could go to that door\nunheard. My brother and his man proceeded up stairs, and found the ser-\nvants in their own rooms, and all doors closed as they had seen just before.\nThey sat up together, my brother and Mr. Luttrell, till break of day, when\nmy brother returned to his own chamber. About that time, as I imagined,\nI heard the chintz room door opened and slammed to with the utmost\nviolence, and immediately that of the liall chamber opened and shut in the\nsame manner. I mentioned to Godin my surprise that my brother, who\nwas ever attentive not to alarm or disturb the children, should hazard both\nby such vehement noise. An hour after I heard the house door open and\nsiam in the same way, so as to shake the house. No one person was then\nup, for as I had never slept, I heard the servants rise and go down about\nhalf an hour afterwards. When we were assembled at breakfast, I observed\nthe noise my brother had made with the doors.\nMr. Luttrell replied, \" I assure you Jervis made not the least noise ;\nit\nwas your door and the next I heard opened and slapped in the way you\ndescribe.\"\nMy brother did not hear either. He afterwards acknowledged to me\nthat when gone to bed and Mr. Luttrell and I were sitting helow, he heard\ndreadful groans and various noises that he was then and after unable to\naccount for. His servant was at that time with mine below.\nCaptain Luttrell declared the disturljances of the preceding night were of\nsuch a nature that the house was an unlit residence for any human_ being.\nMy brother, though more guarded in his expressions, concurred in that\nopinion, and the result of our deliberations was to send an express to Mr.\nSainsbu'ry, Lady H.'s steward, to request he would come over immediately\non a very particular occasion, with which he would be made acquainted on\nhis arrival.\nUnluckily, Mr. Sainsbury was confined with the gout, and sent over his\nclerk, a youth of fifteen, to whom we judged it useless and improper to\ndivulge the circumstances.\nMy brother sat up every night of the week he then passed at H . in\nthe middle of one of these nights I was surprised with the sound of a gun or\npistol let off near me, immediately followed by groans as of a person in\nao-onies, or expiring, that seemed to proceed between my chamber and the\nnext, the nursery. I sent Godin to Nurse Horner, to ask if she had heard\nany noise ; she had not. Upon my inquiry the next morning of my brother,\nhe had [not] heard it, though the report and groans were loud and deep.\nSeveral instances occurred where very loud noises were heard by one or\ntwo persons, when those equally near and in the same direction were not\nsensible of the least impression.\nAs the watching every night made it necessary for my brother to gam\nrest in the day, he usually lay down after dinner. During one of these\ntimes he was gone to rest. I had sent the children and their attendants out\nto walk, the \"dairymaid gone to milk, the cook in the scullery, iny own\nwoman with my brother's man sitting together in tlie servants' hall ;\nI,\nreading in the parlour, heard my brother's bell ring with great quickness. I\nran to his room, and he asked me if I had heard any noise, \"because, '\nsaid\nhe, \" as I was lying wide awake an immense weight seemed to fall through\nthe ceUino- to the floor just by tliat maliogany press, and it is impossible I\n\fApril, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psijchical Research. 65\nshnuld be deceived.\" His man was by this time come up, and said he was\nsitting underneatli the room as I before mentioned, and heard not the least\nnoise. The inquiry and attention my brother devoted to investigate this\naifair was such as from the reach of his capacity and ardent spirit might be\nexpected ; the result was his earnest request that I would quit the place,\nand when obliged to return to Portsmouth, that I would permit him to send\nMr. Nichols, his Lieutenant of Marines, and an old friend of the family, to\ncontinue till my removal with me.\nOne circumstance is of a nature so singularly striking that I cannot omit\nto relate it. In one of our evening's conversations on this wonderful train\nof disturbances I mentioned a very extraordinary effect I had frequently\nobserved in a favourite cat that was usually in the parlour with me, and when\nsitting on table or chair with accustomed vmconcern she would suddenly\nslink down as if struck with the greatest terror, conceal herself under my\nchair, and put her head close to my feet. In a short space of time she would\ncome forth quite unconcerned. I had not long given him this account before\nit was verified to him in a striking manner. We neither then, nor I at other\ntimes, perceived the least noise that could give alarm to the animal, nor did\nI ever perceive the like effect before these disturbances, nor afterwards\nwhen she was removed with me to another habitation. The servants gave\nthe same account of a spaniel that lived in the house, but to that, as I did\nnot witness, I cannot testify.\nThere is another copy, and no more to be taken unless either be de-\nstroyed.

It then appeared I was no longer to be\nsupported, after my brother was convinced I ought not to delay my removal.\nI therefore accepted the earnest invitation of my friends Mr. and Mrs. New-\nbolt, and continued with them till W was prepared for my dear chil-\ndren, where we remained till November, with the exception of three daj's,\nwith Dr. Gilbert, Canon of S- ,\nand his daughter ; and there Lord Radnor\n\u2014then Lord Folkestone\u2014was very desirous to see the lady that came from\nthe haunted house.\nThe Bishop of St. Asajjli opposed, on the ground tliat such means were\nunworthy the Deity to emjDloy, while the good Bishop of W , when I\nrelated that Robert Camis had been thrice called at the window in a voice\nhe well remembered, that of the steward of the late Lord Y., said he should\nhave conjured him hy the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost ; which I\ntold him, but believe no such occasion occurred, or courage failed.

She rei^lied that she lived at the Lower Brook,\nW , and that she (Lucy) had been to see her last year, and asked\nif she remembered having been disturbed by the noises at H ,\nparticu-\nlarly one night when the other servants were gone to bed, when, being in\nthe servants' hall, they heard a sound as of the great iron brazier falling\ntlirough the roof of the pantry (over which tliere was no room), and that it\nwent \" Twiii ! twirl ! tioid ! \" till it sank in the ground. They were so much\nterrified that Lucy would not venture up to the garrets, but slept that night\nin the nursery. They found the brazier the next morning in the place where\nit had been left.\nWhen Lord St. Vincent was in the house, and the servants were sus-\npected of making the disturbances, Mrs. Rioketts went one night for sonae-\nthing she wanted to the housekeeper's room, Avhich opened into the kitchen,\nwhere the domestics were all assembled at supper. She then heard noises,\nand was near fainting, and called to some one to accomjjany her up to her\nbrother.\nThe morning after Mrs. P. 's interment Elizabeth Godin complained to\nthe other servants that she had been dreadfully disturbed the preceding\nnight, and that soon after she was in bed something fell with force against\nthe window, succeeded by a dismal groan.\nLucy said, \" God knows whether these noises were not in consequence of\ntheir sins.\"\nI replied, \" What did you suppose they were guilty of 1\n\"\nShe said, \"God knows whether she had a child and killed it ; but I\ncannot say ; it is not for us to suspect them, God knows.\"\nShe spoke of Mrs. JRicketts in the highest tei'ms and with many teais ;\nsaid she did so much good in the neighbourhood that it was very unlikely\nany should seek to drive her away, above all, her servants, who loved her\nand were in perfect harmony with each other.\nOne night Lucy slept in a small bed in Mrs. Ricketts's room, Elizabeth\nGodin being ill. Mrs. Ricketts woke her and asked if she did not hear\nmusic, which she did, and \"the steps of some one moving stately to it.\"\nThe noises seemed mostly in the lobby and the yellow and adjoining\nchambers.\nLucy said that wlien Mr. Lawrence afterwards took possession of the\nhouse he forbid the ser\\-ants from saying a word of the distin-bances under\npenalty of losing their places. She heard that once, as his housemaid was\nstanding in the lobby, a female figure rushed by and disappeared, but of the\ntruth of this she could not vouch.\nThe foregoing information was given me by Lucy Camis, who was per-\nfectly collected, and I merely made such queries as should lead her on with-\nout in any degree prompting her recollection.\nMartha H. G. Jervis.\nNotes and Remarks by the Marquis of Bute.\nThis case is very interesting, and seems of greater evidential value than\nmany in which it is possible to interrogate the witnesses, because, although\nthe events took place 120 years ago, the witnesses in this Distance were very\nnumerous and various as well as simultaneous and consentient, some of\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The hrst who lived at H appears to\nhave been Sir Tltovias X., knight, described in the Heraldic Visitation of\n1623 (Berry's County Genealogist\u2014Hant^i) as \" Sir Thomas [X.] of M ,\nand\nnow of H ,\n1623.\" It seems not improbal)]e that he built the house, which\nis described in the pamphlet as \"the (.)ld manor-house.\" It is a pity that\nthere is no description, plan, or drawing of the h(juse. It seems to have\nbeen small, as all the servants except the housekeejjer or lady's maid, and\nthe nurse, slept in the attics, and Mrs. Ricketts remarks that when two\npeople were staying there every room on tlie bedroom floor was occupied.\nOn the ground floor there was a drawing-room, probably also the little\nparlour (unless these were the same) where Lord Y. was taken ill, and, it is\nto be presumed, a dining-room. There was also a large hall, seemingly used\nas a servants' hall. There were two staircases, a principal and a back stair,\nand from the foot of one of these a passage ran past the kitchen to an outer\ndoor, perhaps the main house door. Off the kitchen was a housekeeper's\nroom, and near it a scullery. There was also a pantry, over which there\nwas no room. On the bedroom floor there was a principal bedroom, the\nyellow one, which had a dressing-room opeiiing near the back stair. The\nyellow bedroom itself opened into a recess, and this into a lobby, a place\nwith one window and a fireplace , which Mrs. Ricketts says had been used\nas a dining-room. Opposite tlie door of the yellow room was that of the\nnursery ; over the hall was another bedroom, called the chintz room, and\nanother room. On this floor also there was at least one other room, usually\noccupied by the housekeeper or lady's maid. At the top of tlie princiiial\nstaircase was a landing from which was a way to go up to the attics\nSir Thomas married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of John G. of W ,\nB shire, son and heir of Sir John G. of the same, and had at least three\nsons, Hugh, Thomas, and John. He was probably an old man in 1623, as\nhis sister Joan had married George L., of D , S shire, who was High\nSheriff' of that county in 1593. He seems to have died soon after the\nvisitation, as his eldest son, Sir Hngk X, was created a baronet in 1627. He\nis said to have married Sarah, daughter and co-heir of Ambrose D., of L.,\nW\u2014-\n\u2014shire, and to have died about 1642.\nSir Hugh, X., son of the preceding, and second, baronet, is the Sir Hugh X.\nmentioned in the pamphlet as having concealed some papers under tlie floor\nof the dining-room, called 1)y tlie Ricketts the lobby. These papers are\nstated to have been found when the house was pulled down, and to have\nbeen \"broadsides. Arc, which had been concealed during the civil wars.\"\nThey were jirobably compromising under the Republican Government, but,\n\fApril, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psyddcal Research.\nafter the Restoration, were either forgotten by Sir Hugh or regarded with\nindiflference. Under this floor also was found a small box containing a\nlittle skull, which \"was said to be that of a luonkey ;\nbut the matter was\nnever brought forward by any regular inquiry or professional opmion\nresorted to as to the real nature of the skull.\" It is not stated whether the\nbox containing this curious object was found along with the papers, or under\nanother part of the floor. It is impossible to conceive any motive to induce\neither Sir Hugh or anybody else who possessed a monkey's skull as a\nzoological curiosity\u2014the only reason why they could have had it at all\u2014to\nbury it in a box underneath a floor. It is not stated whether the skull fitted\nclosely into the box, or whether there might have been room for anythnig\nelse. A further remark will be made on this skull at the end of this paper.\nThis Sir Hugh X. married twice. His first wife was Catherine, daughter\nand heir of Sir John T., of L H shire, only baronet of that name, as\ncreated in 1660, and who died without male issue in 1672. His second wife\nwas Mary, daughter of John Y. It is not stated which of these ladies\nwas the mother of Mary X., afterwards Mrs. Y. Sir Hugh can scarcely\nhave been less than 80 years of age when he died in 1719, and as he left no\nmale issue, the baronetcy became extinct. He seems to have left several\ndaughters, but I have only the names of Mary, the eldest, and Honoria, the\nyoungest.\nilfarj\/ AT. was married on May lOtli, 1719 (the same year as her father's\ndeath, but doubtless before that event), to Edward Y., third son of Ralph Y.,\nfirst Lord Y. of S , S shire. Mrs. Y. had issue, a son S., who died, at\nWestminster School, aged 16, and a daughter, Mary. She herself died in\nJuly, 1740.\nEdward Y., her widower, continued to live constantly at H ,andwith\nhim continued to reside her sister Honoria, as she had already been used to\ndo in her sister's lifetime. Collins usually gives very full biographical\nnotices, but this case is a curious exception, as he gives nothing but alliances\nand a very few dates. That of Edward Y.'s birth is not mentioned, but as\nhis father died on August 5th, 1689, he cannot have been under 50 years of\nage at the death of his wife in 1740. His daughter Mary married,\nSeptember 3rd, 1750, the Right Hon. Henry B. L., fourth son of\nWilliam L., first Earl of D . On the death of the second of his elder\nbrothers, January 23rd, 1742, he succeeded to the peerage of Y. According\nto Collins he died at A , B shire (which is there called his seat, but\nwhich appears more probably to have been that of his niece Charlotte,\ndaughter of his brother the third Lord Y., in right of her mother, whose\nproperty it was), on April 13th, 1755, and was buried at H ; but according\nto the pamphlet, which appears more likely to be correct, he died suddenly,\nat H , on the morning of April 3rd,' from an apoplectic fit with which he\nhad been seized on the preceding evening.\nMar[I Y., his only daughter and surviving child, was presumably born\nnot later than 1730, and was married, as already stated, on September 3rd,\n1750, to Mr. L.

's death, took place.\nOn October 11th, 1768, she became the second wife of Wills H., then Earl of\nH , but created in 1789 (after her death) Marquess of D . By him she\nhad no issue. She was, as is recorded, fully cognisant of the phenomena\nand even made a sort of apparent attempt to have tliem investigated,\nwith a view to show that they were caused by trickery. It seems also probable\nthat it was by her orders that the house was pulled down. She died July\n29th, 1780.\nHer son, Henry Y. L., succeeded her as second Lord Y. of the new\ncreation. He had married, in 1779, the year preceding her death, Mary\nC, daughter of A. C, first Viscount C, by whom (who died in 1804) he\nhad a daughter Mary, married, August 11th, 1803, to John D., second Lord\nZ. Lord Y. died without male issue in 1820, and the peerage thereupon\nexpired. Lady Z. died October 21st, 1864. The property of H was\napi3arently settled upon her second son and descended to his heirs.\nIt would be interesting to know whether any abnormal jjhenomena are now\nor are recorded to have ever been observed on or about the site of the old\nhouse, whether occupied by the new house or not.\nThe following is a chronological arrangement of the facts, as far as they\nrelate to the phenomena or to the persons who were or may have been\nconnected with them.\n1715.

Tlie\nphenomena were in fact specially observable about April 2nd (Lord Y.'s\nanniversary), February, after Mrs. P.'s death, July, and at least in 1771,\nthe beginning of August. It would appear from the Cheltenham case tliat\nsuch things have a tendency to recur at anniversaries : we do not know the\nday of the death of Isaac M., nor the date of any crime, if crime there were.\nIt may, however, be remarked that July was the montli of the death of\nMrs. Y. (Mary X.), a woman who may have been deeply wronged by the\nrivalry of a younger sister.\nBefore, however, the dismissal of tlie other servants, and therefore\nvery soon after Lord Y.'s death, the first phenomenon occurred. The\ngroom Joseph saw in his room, by bright moonlight, a man in a drab\ncoat, whom he evidently took to be \"his old master,\" i.e.. Lord Y.\nIt does not appear to have been very distinct, since the mark of identity\nhe specified was the way in which the hands were held : not much import-\nance for such a jDurpose can generally be assigned to such a thing, since\nautomatic tricks, such as movements of the hands, are particularly aff'ected\nby heredity ; but in this case none of Lord Y.'s ancestors had ever inhal)ited\nthe house.\nAmong the dismissed servants was Isaac M., house steward. He is\nsj)oken of as dishonest. If such dishonesty were, as indicated, notorious,\nhis impunity appears strange, and looks as if he had some hold over Lord Y.\nThe time of his death is not mentioned, but it must have been before or not\nlong after February, 1770, as his voice was heard and recognised by Robert\nCamis, who entered Mrs. Ricketts's service at that time, and does not\nappear to have lived in the house long after she left in August, 1771.\nCamis's latest information is in November of that year.

My impression is that Dame Camis gave to Mrs. R., and\nMrs. R. believed, the explanation which I have indicated, but that\nshe felt her mouth shut by being practically unable to bring a terrible\naccusation against the memories of the father and aunt of the then still\nliving Lady H., who, as she warmly acknowledges, had always treated her\nwith the utmost courtesy and consideration. This delicacy (which is only what\none would expect from Mrs. R.) also accounts for the reticence used\nabout the narrative, only two copies being made.\nThe theory suggested by Lord Bute as to the cause of the\n\" haunting \" seems to me incompletely established for the foUowino-\nreasons :\n\u2014\n(1) The persons who Avere being discussed in the conversation\nbetween Lucy Camis and Miss Jervis (see p. 67) were the old house-\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research.

There is no positive evidence\nthat their remarks referred to a third person, Honoria X.\n(2) The evidence that a crime was committed consists in tlie\ndiscovery of a small skull, said to be that of a monkey, but which\nmay have l^een a child's, and the fact that Honoria X. lived in Lord Y.'s\nhouse during the lifetime of her sister and also after her death, at\nwhich time she was 52 years of age. The fact of the \" haunting \" does\nnot add to this evidence.\n(3) The \" haunting \" does not appear to have been definitely\nconnected with any anniversary since it went on almost continuously\nfrom April 2nd to the middle of August in one year, also in January,\nFebruary, \" summer,\" July, \" autumn,\" November and December of\nother years.

The election of twelve new\nAssociates of the American Branch was recorded.\nThe Council regret to record the death of Mr. J.

W. H. Myers read a paper on the \"Psychology of\nHysteria,\" which is intended to appear in the next Part of the\nProceedings, in June. He explained that his object was first to\nconnect the various phenomena of hysteria, in so far as they fell under\nthe domain of psychology, under a hypothesis which should include all\ntheir varieties ; and secondly to show how this hypothesis itself\nconfirmed and was confirmed by the general view of human personality\nwhich the speaker had already endeavoured to set forth. As the\nargument was a complex one, and the paper is intended so soon to\nappear in full, further account is reserved.\n\fMay, 1893.] Joiirnal of Society for PsycJiical Research. 79\nMr. F. Podmore then read a paper giving some account of the\nobservations made l)y Professor Richet, Professor Schiaparelli and\nothers on certain phenomena occurring in the presence of Mme.\nEusapia Paladino, of Milan, and recorded in the Jan. -Feb. number\nof the Annates des Sciences Psychiques. The phenomena included the\nlifting of a table from the ground, the alteration of Mme. Paladino's\nweight in the balance, the appearance of hands, etc.\nLady Elizabeth Biddulpii inquired whether anyone present had\nobserved that movements of the air, as of singing, itc, furthered the\nproduction of phenomena such as those obtained in the presence of\nEusapia.\nMr. Podmore replied that this experiment had not been tried by\nProfessor Richet and his collaborators with Eusapia. He was not able\nto say how far it had been successful in other cases.\nMr. Pearsall Smith referred to the hypothesis that some of the\nalleged phenomena of Spiritualism were due to hallucination, and asked\nDr. Bramwell if he would describe to the meeting some of his experi-\nments bearing upon this question.\nDr. Bramwell described an occasion when he had given to a num-\nlier of persons at once a collective hallucination of a type which at a\nseance might have been thought due to spiritual agency.\nSUBLIMINAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE LAPSE OF TIME.\nI.\nThe following experiments in waking at fixed times were made\nby Mr. P.

[May, 1893.\nIII.\nIll connection with the above, we may quote two recent instances\nof the post-hypnotic nieasui'ement of time, like those recorded by\nProfessor Delboeuf, in his paper in Proceedings, Part XXIII., p, 414,\nThe first is an experiment of Professor Krafft-Ebing's, of which an\naccount is given in the Hevtoe de VHypnotisme for March, 189.3, p. 264.\nProfessor Krafffc-Ebing told a hypnotised patient, whom he had cured of\nsevere hysteria, that next day she would enter the ward at ten minutes to\nlive, and at fiva precisely would have a slight hysterical fit\u2014the last which\nshe would ever have \u2014which would he at once cured by hypnotic jjasses.\nThe patient entered at the time indicated. No one knew of the sugges-\ntion which had been made. At six minutes past five by the clock in the\nward the attack came on, and was relieved as had been predicted.\nThe patient had no watch. It was afterwards discovered that the clock\nin the ward was six min.ii.tcs fast. The fit had come on at the real time\nordered, although the only visible timepiece marked the wrong time.\nThe next is described in a letter from Mr. Edwin T. Garner, an\nAssociate of the S.P.R., to Mr. Myers.\nMr. Garner writes :\nGlendale, Alexandra-road, Selhurst, )Surrey. Febfuanj 12th, 1893.\n* -x- * * * \u2022it-\nConcerning Professor Delb'euf's paper, \" Dc ra])preciatiou du temjjs\npar les soniuambules,\" you may like to 1<U(.)W that during tlio past week\na suggestion I made to a subject to be carried out IMJU minutes froin the\ntime of the suggestion was enacted 22 minutes after the time suggested.\nThe subject was to have written an account of how she felt and iHnj she\nwas writing, and here is an extract from her brief descrijjtio}! :\n\" I am in a most perfect state of health and \/cci quite well. ... I\nam writing this because I can't help myself. I feel as if I must do it. I am\nnot really doing it with my own mind ; that is qnite tjone ; yet I must do it.\"\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nThe three cases that follow are all instances of a veridical impres-\nsion with regard to the death of a friend or relative reaching the\npercipient some time after the death has occurred, but before the fact\nhas become known to him by ordinary means. Cases of this kind do\nnot afibrd such strong evidence of telepathy as impressions occurring\nat the time of death, because the period of time between the death and\nthe arrival of tlie news being conqaaratively long, affords greater scope\nfor the o]5eration of cliance coincidence ; hut wc print these because\nthere is clear evidence in all of them that the iidrcipient described his\nimpression in writing befiu'c he recei\\ ('(l the news of the death.\n\fMay, 1S93.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nG. 234. Dream.\nFrom Mr. Myers.\nThe following case has been kindly sent to me by the Rev. George\nWilHams, of Trefonen Rectory, Oswestry, with whom I am personally\nacquainted. It will be seen that we have here a letter which was\nwritten in consequence of a dream of death, before the fact of death\nwas known. The dream, which is of a funeral, falls between the\nactual death and funeral. The letter is written after the news of\nillness, but before the news of death.\n\u2014\nF. W. H. M.\nMr. Williams writes under date September \u202222nd, 1892 :\n\u2014\n\" This morning, in going round my parishioners, I was asked to read the\naccompanying letter. The mother of the writer of it died on August 29tli,\nand was buried on September 2nd.\"\nThe letter, now in Mr. Myers' possession, is addressed\" Mrs. Thomas\nH.Stokes, Underbill, Trefonen, Oswestry, England\" ;\nand bears the post-\nmarks \"Red Bluff, Sep. 8, 1892,\" and \"Oswestry, Sep. 21, 1892.\" It\nis dated \"Red Bluff, Cahfornia, September 6, 1892,\" and runs as\nfollows :\n\u2014\n\" Dear Lizzie,\u2014I wrote to dear mother yesterday and posted it this morn-\ning, and since then I received yours of Aug. 22nd, saying that she is very ill.\nI was afraid there was something the matter, as on the night of Aug. 31st,\nor the morning of Sept. 1st, I dreamed I was in a house where there\nwas a funeral going on. Everybody was dressed in black, and I saw you all\nthere except mother, and father told me that she was dead, and that it was\nher funeral that was then in process of being carried out ;\nand I have not\nbeen able to shake off the sad feeling it caused me since. If dear mother is\nstill alive, tell her, &c. [private matters follow]. Please write at your\nearliest, as I am naturally anxious to hear about her.\nYour aff. brother, John V. Owen.\"\nMr. Williams encloses a memorial card which states that Margaret,\nwidow of John Owen, of Great Weston, Cluirchstoke, Montgomeryshire,\ndied at Underbill, Trefonen, August 29th, 1892, aged 80 years, and\nwas interred at Churchstoke September 2nd, and a copy of the Ostvestry\nAdvertiser to the same effect. He adds :\n\" The late Mrs. Owen wrote\nregularly to her son John once a month, and heard from him about as\noften. Mr. John Owen's father and uKjther were first cousins. The\nfather died 16 years ago. The son had not seen his mother for 12 years.\nThe only cause for anxiety would be Mrs. Owen's great age, 80\nyears. He never had written home before in consequence of a dream.\n\u2014\nThe fuueral took place at Churchstoke on the morning of September\n2nd. It had been intended for Scpt(;mber 1st.\"\nMr. AVilliams sends also JMr. .John V.

Mrs. Owen's letter had\nfollowed him about, and had thus been delayed.\nCt. 2.35. Dream.\nWe obtained this case through Mr. J. h>. Netherton, of Farnham\nArms, Cavan, Ireland, to whom we wrote upon learning from Mr. W.\nT. Stead that he had some information to sfive. Mr. Netherton in his\ntui'n put his friend Mr. W. Groom, of the Commercial Hotel, Strabane,\nIreland, in connnunication with us. Mr. Groom writes :\nJannarii lUh, 1892.\nA friend of mine, Mr. J. S. Netherton, has written me with reference to\na letter received from Australia, which he asks me to forwaixl to you. I do\nnot know whether you have the particulars, but in case you haven't, I give\nthem here. The writer of the letter was an old schoolmate of my own, and\nmore particularly of my brother, and spent most of his evenings in our house.\nNot getting along as well as he wished, he took a situation in Armagh, and\nafter a year or two passed out of our immediate notice, no letters pasising\nlietween us. We hoard nothing for years until the enclosed letter came from\nAustralia addressed to my In-otlier. My brother died on the 8th January,\n1891, and at the time he died, and for years before, knew nothing of Mr.\nLittle, and did not know lie was in Melbourne. The descrijjtion in the letter\nis quite cijrrect of the death. I liave six sisters, but my mother, self, and\ntwo sisters mentioned were the only ones in the room when he died. The\nletter caused a good deal of surprise amongst <jur intimate friends.\n(Signed) W. Ckoom.\nThe letter referred to is addressed to \"Mr. James Groom, 7,\nNicholson-terraee, Londonderry, Ireland,\" and the postmark on the\nenvelope is J\/elbour-nc, A}?. lu.'Jl. The letter itself is dated \"Melbourn(',\nApril loth,\" and begins :\n\"Dear Dubosc, \u2014No doubt you will be surprised at getting a letter from\nme from this part of the globe. . .\n.\" [Then follows a long account of\ntlie writer's reasons for leaving Armagh, a description of the voyage out\nto Melbourne, and of his movements and prospects at that place. The letter\nconcludes as follows :\n]\n\" So good-bye, Dubosc, until we meet, but I am afraid never, as I thought\nI saw you dead, as I had a dream one night and saw you stretclied out on a\nbed all dressed in white, and your mother, Jessie, Willie and Mary all\nstanding round you crying. I do not believe in superstition, but I saw the\npicture before my eyes, as plain as I see the paper I am writing on ; but of\ncourse it was only a dream and a fancy of the mind recalling old associations.\n\" Your old chum,\n(Signed) \" Wm.

But in writing to us hiter, in answer\nto our inquiries, Mr. Little adds the rest of the family to the group\n\u2014\nwhich may possibly Ije due to an illusion of memory. Writing from\nAustralia on the 29th of March, 1892, he says :\n\u2014\nI remember the dream pretty well, altht)ugli it was about a year ago.\nI also remember as well as I can, but I would not say certain, as to the\nIjrecise date (whereas if I had taken a thought I would have done so), but as\nfar as I bring to memory it was about beginning of February, in or about\nfirst five days of the month, and as I did not attach much importance to it,\nI did not speak of it to anybody whatever.\nI remember the dream was as vividly before my senses as possible, and\nis as follows. I could see him lying in bed, with his mother and sisters,\nJessie, Bella, Nelly, and the rest, around the bed, looking at him anxiously,\nand I believe his brother in my vision was there also. I saw the picture so\nplaced on my mind that nothing effaces it ofi' it, and I thought from the\nanxious expression on their faces that ho wa ; sick (as he was pretty often\nlaid up) and had a worse than usual attack of asthma, but something\nprompted when writing the letter to him to mention tlie occui'rence \u2014casually\n\u2014not thinking for a single moment that death had done its work. And I\nmade the remark aljout this, as something was ijrouipting to make the remark,\nabout never seeing him again. I could not tell what inttueiice made me do\nso, but I could not shake it off\u2014writing it to him, the living man, as I\nthought, and not a dead one. (Signed) Wm. Little.\nIf Mr. Little's memory as to the date of the dream is approximately\ncorrect, it occurred about a nmnth after the death. Between the\ndream and his letter describing it an account of the death reached\nAustralia from Mr. Little's li(nne, but this account did not come into\nhis hands until four days after his letter was posted to the dead man.\nThe cause of this delay was that Mr. Little did not call at the address\nto which his letters were to be sent, and he sends us the following note\nto make this clear.\nWiUiamstowu, April ISth, 1891.\nDear Willie, \u2014Please to call for letters, papers and portraits that is\nlying at our place the last 3 weeks ; was t(jld that you had left the tram, or\nI would have sent you word before. \u2014Your aftectionatc cousin,\n(Signed) Annie Linuley.\nAmongst these letters, which Mr. Little says he obtained on the\nnext day (19th), was the one from his mother announcing the death ;\nhe encloses the envelope, which bears postmarks, \" Londonderry Feb.\n19.91\u2014Melbourne, MR 25.91.\"\nG. 236. Dream.\nFrom My Canadian Juurncil, by tlic Marchioness of Dufl'crili. 1891.\n(p. 82.) Monday, oUth [.June, 187u]. . . . We were just going to\nbegin lisliing again. \u00ab hen an Indian canoe arri\\ ed Ininging us very sad news.\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1893.\nOne of our footmen had gone out fishing and was drowned. We returned\nimmediately. We saw the place where the accident happened ; on the rocks\nlay a piece of bread he had been eating. He had got up and stood at the\nedge of the water with his rod. The steward said, \" Can you swim ? \" \"No.\"\n\"Then take care, for it is slijipery, and the water is very deep.\" \"Never\nfear,\" he said, and instantly slipped. He put up his hands to take off the\nmosquito veil he Iiad on, and disappeared. The steward dived after him,\nbut he never rose at all. A boat was got, and presently the men saw the\ntliick end of a fishing-rod sticking up. They took hold of it, and lifted the\npoor dead body up with it. He appeared to be upright in the water, the\nrod fast in his hand.\n(p. 88.) Friday, 11th [July, 1873]. You remember that I told you that\na poor manservant of ours was drowned at the Mingan. As we knew nothing\nabout his people, we were unable to communicate the news of his death to\ntliem, so D. ordered any letters that might arrive for him to be brought to\nhimself. Tlie first of these\u2014which we have just received\u2014was from a\nservant-girl he was attached to at Ottawa, and was dated exactly seven days\nafter the day of the accident. In it she said :\n\" I have been in my new place\na week, and T like it very much, but I had such a dreadful dream on the day\nof my arrival. I dreamt that you and Nowell were upset in a boat together,\nand that Nowell was saved, but you were drowned.\" As the spot where the\naccident occurred is in an uninhal)itod region on the coast of Labrador, more\ntlian 500 miles from Ottawa, witliout either telegraphs or jjosts, it was\nimpossible that she should have had tlie news of her lover's death when this\nletter was written.\nCORRESPONDEN CE.\nTHE LATE mi. S. J. DAVEy's EXPERIMENTS.\nTo tin: Editor of the Jouknal of the Hociety von Psy'chical Eeseaisch.\nSii!,\u2014 In the last number of your Jovnial Mr. Wallace gives his experi-\nence of slate-writing, in which he endeavours to show that he took such\nprecautions as to make it impossible he could have been deceived by sleight\nof hand ; but Mr. Hodgson, in reviewing Mr. Wallace's statements, says, p. 47 :\n\"Mr. Wallace's statements must be regarded as probably misdescriptions,\nand as practically worthless for proving any supernormal jjlienomena.\"\nNow, as Mr. Wallace has all his life devoted himself, and with most signal\nsuccess, to the close observation of nature, it must surely strike most think-\ning minds that Mr. Hodgson cannot be justified in his expressions of contempt\nregarding Mr. Wallace's powers of observation regarding an occult pheno-\nmenon with which from long expeiience he is very familiar.\nFurther, if Mr. Hodgson considers himself justified in thus expressing\nhimself regarding the mental capabilities of so distinguished a man of science\n;is Mr. Wallace, it seems useless for me to l)reak a lance with In'm on the\n})oint of occult slate- writing ;\nne\\-crt]icless, as Mr. Wallace in liis paper\nlio[ies that \" other Spiritualists may now make knmvn their ex|ievieuces of\nslate- writing [ilieuomena,\" I venture to give one i.>f my experiences ;\nfor.\n\fMay, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nalthough I have had many to myself absolutely convincing experiences,\nyet I now confine myself to one experience, namely, the experience which\nun one occasion I had with Slade and the one which I gave in the police-\ncourt when I appeared in defence of that medium against the attack of Dr.\nLankester, in 1877. But as Mr. Hodgson might say that my memory could\nnot be altogether reliable after so long an interval, I will state my case as\ngiven on p. 22 in my book Tlieusophtj and the Hkjlm Life, published 1880.\nI there say : \"I took one out of many slates lying on a table before me.\nHaving taken this slate in hand I tuovld not permit Slade to touch it. I ex-\namined it for a considerable time on both sides. It was a dry, dusty, new\nschool slate, without the slightest trace of writing on its surface. I then\ntook a small fragment of slate pencil and laid it on the table and covered it\nwith my slate. I then seized both of Slade's legs between mine, and both\nhis hands in mine, and having rested my elbow on the slate, I said to Slade,\n'I am ready, now write.' Instantly I heard a sound as of rapid, energetic\nwriting, with a slate pencil, and then tliree raps to indicate the message was\nfinished. I released Slade's hands, and carefully raising the slate from the\ntable, I found a message clearly written in strong dtidij slate writing, com-\nposed of about twenty words and containing five of my family names, viz. ,\na\nmessage urging two of my sceptical brothers to investigate the subject.'\nI added that tlie table on the top of which the slate rested was a solid,\nhard wood table, and that physical access to the under surface of my slate\nwas impossible. I added that I was not more certain of my existence than I\nwas that the writing I got could not possibly have come through liuman\nhands ; and I now add that the experiment was in broad daylight, no one\nbeing present but myself and Slade.\nI cannot conceive that Mr. Hodgson can have any answer to tliis demon-\nstration of occult slate-Avriting excejit by saying that either intentionally or\nunintentionally I am stating an untruth. But should he make this answer,\nI could only reply that in that case lie is altogether unfit to sit in judgment\non the matter. Geoiige Wyld, M.D.\nFieldliead, Wimbledon Park, Surrey.\n3Iarch 10th, 1893.\nTo tlie Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir, \u2014I shall be glad if you can afibrd me space for a few observations on\nMr. Hodgson's letter in reply to that of Mr. Wallace in this month's \/onnioZ.\nMr. Hodgson says: \"The chief object of the investigation with Mr.\nDavey was to estimate the true worth of testimony to ' psychographic '\nand\nsimilar performances.\" \"Investigation,\" sir ! Can that be called an \"investi-\ngation \" to which none are admitted except such as regard the thing to be\ninvestigated from one particular point of view only ?\nIn Februa,ry, 1887, I wrote in the Journal, proposing that Mr. Davey\nshould perform liis feats \"in the presence .of some well-known Spiritualists,\"\nand I believe a similar proposal was made by others about the. same time.\nThis proposal, however, Mr. Hodgson thought it prudent to decline, fearing,\nas he said in the Frornedimjs of May, 1887, \"that the psychical condition of\n\f8(S Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, i8\"j3.\nSpiritualists might be i\\ bar to Mr. Davey's performances \" 1 This excuse, I\nmay observe by the way, seems to Irave been forgotten by Mr. Hodgson in\n1892. In the Proceedings publislied in July of that year (p. 254) he\ninforms us that \"the only argument which had special cogency in his own '\ncase\" (i.e., for not allowing the presence of Spiritualists at Mr. Davey's\nseances) \"was Mr. Davey's purpose to give another series of sittings.\"\nTluis Mr. Hodgson's account of the matter in 1892 when Mr. Davey was\ndead is altogether inconsistent with that wliich he gave in 1887 when Mr.\nDavey was alive.\nWell, sir, when in 1887 I found that Mr. Hodgson declined on the plea\nof \"psychical conditions \" an investigation in Mr. ^Davey's presence at which\nboth sides should be represented, I proposed that Mr. Lewis (Professor\nHoffman), who was an \"expert\" and a \"quasi-professional\" conjurer, and\nwho had had a quarter of a century's experience in the art, should undertake\nto perform the feats in question. Mr. Davey had taken him as well as Mr.\nHodgson into his confidence and had explained to him how the tricks were\ndone. As a skilful prestidigitateur, and as one who had been let into the\nsecrets of the modus operandi, he would, I supposed, be able to perform such\nfeats as are jjerformed by the so-called mediums, male and female. This\nprcjposal, however, was simply ignored by Mr. Hodgson, though surely not\nbecause he was afraid of the \"psychical conditions \" in the case of Mr. Lewis\nalso. And now he gravely reminds us of an \" investigation \" !\nMr. Hodgson tells us in the Proceed lugs (P-M-t XL, p. 403) that the highest\n\" class of conjuring consists in inducing the witness to entrap himself ;\nthat the\nconjurer is like a clever thief who while posing as a detective manages to\nempty your pockets.\" Now, sir, if I may adapt Mr. Hodgson's method of\nmeeting Mr. Wallace's statements, or rather the statements of every witness\non the Spiritualists' side, I will say, \"hi spite of Mr. Hodgson's belief to\nthe contrary,\" Mr. Davey may have acted the part of the clever thief in his\ntransactions with him, and may have very thoroughly emptied his pockets.\n\" It is possible\" tliat Mr. Davey did not write with a thimble pencil as Mr.\nHodgson says he did (Part XXII., p. 2.56), but that he only pretended to do\nwhat had already been done by psychical force. \"It is possible \" tliat Mr.\nDavey did not substitute a slate which had already been written upon, as Mr.\nHodgson says he did (tliid.), for another on which the sitter expected the\nwriting, but simply pretended to do so in order to empty one of Mr.\nHodgson's pockets. \"It is possible\" that in the case of the two locked\nslates spoken of Mr. Davey did not open one, write the answer on it, and\nthen substitute it for the other, as Mr. Hodgson says he did (ibid.), but that\nhe only pretended to do so in order to empty another of Mr. Hodgson's\npockets. Indeed, I cannot help thinking that Mr. Hodgson's jnethod is\npeculiarly applicable to his own evidence. We perceive a sort of grim\njustice in the turn of aflairs when, in the case of a man who has made the\nmost frantic efforts to prove all that differ from him fools, we discover that\nin the very midst of those eflbrts, and even by means of them, he himself is\nbeing made a fool of.\nBut even if we grant that Mr. Davey performed all his feats )jy simple con-\njuring and tluit the so-called mediums iierforiii theirs by tlie same means, will\n\f^[AY, 1S.13.] JoLinial of Society for P.^ijchical Re>^eavcli. 80\nMr. Hodgson be one whit nearer the end of his difficulties ? Those so-called\nmediums have been invariably, I believe, comparatively young men or\nwomen, and it does not seem that any attempt has been made to show that\nthey had practised conjuring, or acjuired any skill in it at all, previous to\ntheir mediumistic career. Now, Mr. Hodgson will not, I suppose, deny that\nthe feats done in their presence require at least the very greatest conjuring\nskill for their performance, so very great, indeed, that ordinary conjurers can-\nnot do them even after they have had the modn, operandi pointed out to\nthem. This conclusion is, I think, inevitable from the fact that Mr. Hodgson\nand Professor Hoffman declined my proposal. I should be glad, therefore,\nto be permitted to ask the two following questions\n1. What is the explanation of the fact that those young men and women\nare possessed of such extraordinary skill and adroitness ?\n2. How is it that even \" experts \" who have been let into the secrets, and\nwho have had an experience in conjuring longer than the lives of some of the\nso-called mediums, will not even attempt to perform the feats which are\ndone by those who, as far as we know, have had no experience m conjuring\nI p;-Gsume Mr. Hodgson will consider himself liound to answer these two\nquestions.\n[As we do not propose to give space in future numbers of the Jininial for\nfarther discussion on this matter, we will ourselves answer the questions put\nby Mr. Harpur to Mr. Hodgson.\n1. There is no reason to think that youth interferes with skill in conj ur-\nines, and mediums are by no means as a rule young men or women (t-.;\/.,\nEglinton and Slade), while the skill and adroitness exhibited by professional\nmediums is frequently not at all extraordinary.\n2. As a general rule there is no reason why experts in conjuring should\nattempt to\u00b0perform the particular feats attempted by mediums, since,\nregarded as amusing or interesting performances, apart from their spirit-\nualistic pretensions, slate-writing and materialisation seances offer little\nattraction. ^\nThere are some other points that call for attention in Mr. Harpur s\nletter. In paragraph 2, he states that Mr. Davey admitted no sitters,\n\"except such as regarded the thing to be investigated from one ijarticular\npoint of view only.\" A cursory study of the article in Prooeediiujs, Vol. IV.,\np. 381 et seq., will show that this was not the case.\nIn paragraph 3, Mr. Harpur says that Mr. Hodgson declined the pro-\nposal that Mr. Davey should perform his feats in the i^resence of some well-\nknown Spiritualists, because he feared that the psychical condition of\nSpiritualists might be a bar to Mr. Davey's performances. The statement\nquoted was not given by Mr. Hodgson as a reason for declining that Mr.\nDavey should perform \" \/lis \/eafs \" before Spiritualists, but refers (see Vol.\nIV., p. 390) to the claim made by some Spiritualists \"that Mr. Davey should\nproduce in their presence a phenomenon similar to and under the same con-\nditions as .sojii\" phenomenon ivhich then describe themseUm as haviwj witnessed\nwith a professional medium,\" and Mr. Hodgson remarks that \"their\n\f90 Journal of Society for Ptiychldtd Research. [May, isfls.\npsychical condition, so different in the two cases\u2014in one, a favouring co-\noperation, in tlie otlier, a resolve to expose\u2014might be a bar to Mr. Davey,\nbut an open door to the medium.\" It is obviously easier for a person who\nknows that a conjuring trick is to be i^erformed to detect it than if he\nbelieves it to be a supernatural phenomenon.\nFurther on in the same paragraph, the sentence which Mr. Harpur puts\nin brackets supplies the context incorrectly. Mr. Hodgson says : (Vol. VIII.,\np. 253) \" It was my own personal opinion that on the whole it was advisable\nthat the methods of Mr. Davey should be described in detail. . . . Mr.\nDavey, however, was strongly opposed to the revelation, and for various\nreasons. . . . Mr. Davey's death has removed the only argument\nwhich had special cogency in my own case, viz., his purpose to give another\nseries of sittings.\" The statement has nothing to do with the question\nwhether Spiritualists should be admitted to Mr. Davey's seances and cannot,\ntherefore, be inconsistent with anything Mr. Hodgson said on that subject.\nWith regard to the fourth paragrapli in Mr. Harpur's letter, Mr. Hodgson's\nremark as to \"psychical conditions\" would of course apply to Mr. Lewis,\nor to any otlier conjurer who jjrofessed to imitate by conjuring \" medium-\nistic \" phenomena in the presence of Spiritualists, as well as to Mr. Davey.\nMr. Harpur says towards the end of his letter that to imitate \" medium-\nistic \" feats requires so much skill that ordinary conjurers cannot do it\neven after being told the methods. We need only refer to Mr. Hodgson's\narticle in Pror.efdiiKj.% Vol. VIII., p. 253, and Mr. Davey's in Vol. IV.,\np. 405, to show that Mr. Davey is not the only conjurer who has successfully\nimitated \"mediumistic\" phenonrena. Ed.]\nHYPNOTISM AS A THERAPEUTIC AGENT.\nTo Ihv EiVdor of Ihi' Journal of thts Sociktv for Psychical E.esearch.\nSir, \u2014I have l)een asked to write a note for the Jonriud, briefly stating\nthe great l>enetifc which my health has derived from hypnotic suggestion,\nmainly given by Mr. G. A. Smith at the Wednesday evening meetings held\nat the Society's rooms.\nUnder heavy pressure of mental work, combined with great responsibility,\nI was a year ago suffering from nervous indigestion in a chronic and\naggravated form, together with insomnia, distressing dreams, and palpita-\ntion. My doctor, a s]jecially able man, frequently told me tliat he could give\nme no permanent relief so long as the strain on the ner\\'es remained so\ngreat, and advised me rather to relinquish my work.\nFrom the first experiment tried by Mr. G. A. Smith, when he succeeded\nin inducing a light hypnosis, my health began to improve steadily. I slept\nwell at night, and the indigestion slowly but steadily passed away ; and I can\nconfidently say that during the past twelve months under a course of sug-\ngestion from Mr. Smith and Dr. Bramwell, I have been, in spite of many\nadverse circumstances, stronger than I ever remember being before. The\nhypnosis induced has never been profound, as I always retain consciousness\nof my surroundings. This fully confirms the statement made by several dis-\ntinguished speakers at the recent Congress, that for therapeutic purposes the\n\fMay, 1S93.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 91\nligliter stages of trance are ([uite as beneficial as the more 2)i'ofi>innl, the\ndegree of suggestibility being independent of the depth of the hypnosis.\nMr. Smith was also able on one occasion to produce, by a post-hypnotic\nsuggestion, entire insensibility in an extremely sensitive tooth, which was\nstopped the next day without my feeling any pain, altliough tlie nerve was so\nexposed that on a previous occasion the dentist had been obliged to desist\nfrom the attempt. The extreme sensitiveness persisted up to the time I\nentered the consulting room, but vanished, in obedience to the suggestion\ngiven on the previous evening, immediately I took my seat in the operating-\nchair.\nMay I add that, in my opinion, if members of the Society residing in, or\nvisiting, London, would avail themselves in larger numbers of the oppor-\ntunity for experiment and discussion offered by the Wednesday evening\nmeetings at 19, Buckingham-street, they would soon fi.nd themselves repaid\nby the interest the whole subject of hypnotism presents to every candid\ninquirer. \u20141 am, sir, yours obediently, J.

There was a full attendance.\nProfessor W. Ramsay, Ph.D., F.R.S., read a paper on \"Experiments\nwith Anesthetics.\" He described the mental state produced when he\nwas partially under the influence of anaesthetics. There were no\ndreams, that is, no connected story as is usual in dreams ; but an over-\nwhelming mental impression that he alone was a self-centred existence\non which passing events made little or no impression. He became\nfully convinced of the truth of Bishop Berkeley's theory that all\nexternal objects are merely impressions on the mind, and have in\nthemselves no real existence. This state of mind recurred under the\ninfluence of very varied anassthetics, and was essentially the same,\nhowever long a period was allowed to elapse between the repetition of\nthe experiment. It appears to be caused largely by the fact that,\nwhile under antesthetics, every trivial event which happened was\nknown to have happened before ; each noise, each trifling visual\nimpression could have been predicted ; and the certainty of such\nrecurrence made it appear as if the state of mind was merely a\nrepetition of a similar previous state : that life was made up of cycles,\n\fJixE, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 05\neach cycle consisting of the same events repeated in the same oi'der,\nand thus confirming each other, and establishing the justice of the\ninference that the mind alone was stable and enduring while such\nevents were transitory, but capable of recurrence in definite order.\nThe feeling of expectation was always aroused that it would on each\noccasion be possible to penetrate a little further into the secret of the\nuniverse, that is, to fathom a little more deeply the secret nature of\nThe mind. The belief is not an intellectual one, but is of the nature\nof faith because of full knowledge. .-\nHe had purposely refrained from consulting the literature of the\nsubject for fear of influencing his recollection of his own impressions ;\nbut in an account, subsequently consulted, of experiments by Sir\n.Humphry Davy, the only record, among some 25 accounts by well-\nknown men of the effects of nitrous oxide, of a set of impressions similar\nto his, is by Davy himself. He, too, appears on one occasion to have\nfelt very strongly that he was self-existent and alone in the universe,\nthat nothing is real save thought.\nThe author expressed the hope that others who may have the\nopportunity may also chronicle their impressions under antesthetics, for\nthe physiology of the mind is best to be understood from its pathology.\nDr. Lloyd Tuckey said that he thought the sensations experienced\nby Professor Ramsay resembled those considered characteristic of\nIndian hemp or hashish rather than those usually attributed to\nchloroform or ether.\nFurther experiments would perhaps prove the correctness of a\ni-ecent hypothesis that the psychical action of anpesthetics, and also of\nhypnotism, was due to the suppression of the subject's objective con-\nsciousness and the dominance of what Mr. Myers calls the subliminal\nconsciousness.\nThe manifestations of the latter would vary with the education and\ntemperament of the experimenter, and we should therefore expect to\nget difi'erent results in different experiments.\nMr. Edward Maitland gave an account of the experiences under\nchloroform of a lady, a graduate of the University of Paris and member\nof its medical faculty. He said that these were to be regarded as\ndemonstrations of the existence in lier of the four planes of being,\ncalled the Spiritual, the Psychic, the Astral or Magnetic, and the\nPhysical or Material, and as proof of the doctrine of re-incarnations.\nWhile under the influence of the anfesthetic, administered to relieve\npain, she seemed to manifest three different personalities. The first\nwas apparently her normal self, speaking in the first person and pre-\ndicting that she would not live long. On further application of the\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1893.\nchloroform, her voice chcanged, becoming Hke a man's. This personality\nannounced itself as \" the Astral \" and said that it would be better to\nlet her die then, so as to avoid the suffering that would come if she\nlived longer, and that she could not in any case live more than ten\nyears longer. On an occasion six weeks later, the anaesthesia induced\nbeing still more profound, she spoke in another voice, saying that her\n\"former selves,\" none of whom had lived beyond forty, were determined\nthat she should not live any longer, and were trying to force her to\nsuicide. This voice was to be regarded as being from the plane of the\nSpiritual ego. In the two latter conditions, she spoke of herself in the\nthird person. She died at the age of 41, rather more than a year\nafter these exj^eriences.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers said that whatever might be the inner\nmeaning of the incident described l)y Mr. Maitland, it pointed at any\nrate to the fact that the mind of the narcotised person was wont to\nmove among the same ideas wliich occupied the waking mind, and\npossibly to obey some form of self-suggestion. He was therefore glad\nthat Professor Ramsay had kept his own experiences so independent of\nany prepossession from accounts of similar experiences ; but hoped\nthat Professor Ramsay would now collect other such accounts, and\nplace them alongside his own.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then read part of a paper by Dr. A. T. Myers\nand himself on \"Mind-healing, Faith-healing, and the Miracles of\nLourdes,\" which it is hoped will appear immediately in Proceedings\nXXIV. The authors came to the conclusion that of these three\ngroups the records of Lourdes offered the best instances of cure, but\nthat there was no convincing evidence that these cures surpassed\nother psycho-therapeutical results, attained elsewhere without any\nclaim to miracle.\nThe Rev. R. F. Clarke, S. J., while acknowledging the courteousness\nand consideration shown to Catholic beliefs by Messrs. Myers,\nregretted that they had omitted any discussion of individual cases of\ncures wrought at Lourdes. Many of these were in his opinion quite\ninexplicable by any natural agency, and he would have been glad to\nhear how Messrs. Myers proposed to explain them. They had heard\nthat there was no connecting link between the apparition to\nBernadette and the miracles. This was a mistake. The Lady seen by\nBernadette ordered her to scratch the ground at the back of the\ngrotto and a stream would issue from the earth. On her obeying, the\nwater began to appear, until it became a plentiful stream, and it was\nthis stream which supplied the water whicli was the instrument of the\nmiracles. Messrs. Myers had described this water as a fetish, but it\n\\\nI\nI\n\fJuke, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research- 97\nwas no more a fetish than the water of Bethesda and Siloam mentioned\nin the Gospels, or the handkerchiefs from the body of St. Peter hy\nwhich miracles were worked. If Bernadette had seen nothing, how\ncould she ever have gathered thousands when she knelt day by day on\nthe banks of the Gave ? Let any peasant girl try an imposture, or let\nher fancy she sees what is really due to her own imagination, and\nthen see if she will convince educated men as Bernadette did. The\nfact is she was transformed in appearance while she saw the vision of\nOur Lady, and those present could not resist the siglit. At Lourdes\nthey might not have all the details of scientific method to be found in\na hospital, but there was quite enough skilled evidence to convince the\nunprejudiced. Father Clarke concluded by inviting any present who\nwere interested in the subject to visit Lourdes, if possible between\nAugust IGth and 23rd, when the chief pilgrimage took place. Every\nfacility for investigation would be given them, and they would at\nleast see things that would astonish them.\nDii. J. Milne Bramavell said : In reference to the alleged miracu-\nlous cure of disease two questions might fairly be asked : Have all\npossible errors of diagnosis been excluded, and could the cures have\nresulted from means other than miraculous ? Some years ago one of\nmy patients had his eyes injured. One had to be removed, while the\nsight of tlie other was considered entirely lost, and a certificate to this\netfect given by a skilled ophthalmic surgeon. He considered the loss of\nsight due to complete detachment of the retina, and was so convinced\nof this that, previous to an operation on the other eye, he proposed to\nremove this one as useless and a possible source of danger to the\nsuccess of the operation. After twelve months of blindness the patient\ncommenced to see a little, and speedily recovered complete power of\nvision. At this time he was having no treatment, but had the cure\noccurred during a visit to Lourdes it would have been deemed\nmiraculous, and to disprove this, in the face of the medical evidence,\nwould have been almost impossible. An effusion of lymph into the\nvitreous humour had been mistaken for detached retina.\nFather Clarke referred to a case of eczema as one of miraculous\ncure. Three years ago I had a case of this kind under my observation.\nIt had existed for four years, had been treated by able specialists, one\nof whom considered it to owe its origin to certain organic changes, for\nthe relief of which operative measures were resorted to, but these and\nall other treatment proved ineffectual, and recourse was had to\nhypnotism. On the first day on which hypnosis was induced all the\ndistressing symptoms disappeared and the skin rapidly regained its\nnormal condition.\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [.Tune, 1893.\nA sevei'e case of localised liyperidrosis, of many years' standing,\nsuch as is rarely relieved by ordinary medical treatment, was partially\narrested on the first induction of hypnosis, and completely cured the\nfollowing day. Both these cases have now remained cured over three\nyears.\nIn a severe case of acne of seven years' duration, in which all\ntreatment had heen abandoned for twelve months, marked improve-\ninent immediately followed hypnosis, and the disease apparently was\nsuddenly arrested.\nFacts such as these render necessary a keen scrutiny of the alleged\nnature of the diseases supposed to be miraculously cured, and also point\nto the important part suggestion may possibly play in these cures.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers said in reply to Father Clarke that he had\na number of detailed discussions of cases with him, and had only\nwaited to see (m Avhicli particular class of case Father Clarke laid\nstress. The lateness of the hour, however, precluded his now reading\nthese somewhat technical discussions, which would, he hoped, shortly\nbe laid before the Society in print. He cordially welcomed Father\nClarke's assurance of the willingness of the authorities at Lourdes to\naccept suggestions as to the improvement of their medical e\\ idence.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE\nFROM A DISTANCE.\nL. 952.\nThe following series of experiments in the transference of diagrams\nfrom a distance of over 200 miles was sent us by the agent, the Re^\nAug. Glardon, M.A., a well-known Swiss author, residing in Tour de\nPeilz, Vaud, Switzerland. The percipient was a tViend of his, Mrs. M.,\nwho was staying tii'st at Bordighera and afterwards at Florence.\nMrs. M. is an Associate of the S.P.R.\nA short time before trying the experiments with diagrams, Mr.\n(ilardon, when staying at Cannes, had tried to transfer short sentences\nto Mrs. M., then at Nice, with a certain amount of success. In two\nor three instances, he tells us, it was not the sentence which he had\nintended to transfer that was received, \" but one or two thoughts to\nwhich I gave vent aloud, for my own benefit, during the sitting, with\ngreat earnestness, and which were heard and written down accurately\nby \" the percipient. Unfortunately, however, these experiments were\nnot fully recorded at the time, so that Mr. Glard(.)n is not able to give\nus full details of them, or to say exactly what proportion of success waij\nobtained.\n\fJune, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 99\nOn March 28th, 1893, Mr. Glardon, at Tour de Peilz, made his\nHrst attempt to transfer diagrams to Mrs. M., at Bordighera. They\nhad never before tried this form of experiment, either when together\nor from a distance. On April 28th, 1893, he writes from Tour de\nPeilz :\u2014\nTlie percipient, Mrs. M., was at Bordighera ; the agent, myself, here at\nTour de Peilz. We had agreed that on the 28th March and 1st April I\nwould transfer telepathically to her at half-past ten p.m. (Ronian time) one\nor two figures, geometrical or other. Hlie was to see tliem bright nn the dark\nbackground of her closed eyes, and to draw tlieui witli a jiencil withuut\nopening her eyes.\nOn the 28tli March 1 drew on a sheet of paper tirst a cro.ss (iive scpiares),\nthen a four-coi-nered star. With the four-cornered star I did not succeed\nwell at iirst, nor even a second time. Tlie tliird drawing was a little better,\nas you can judge from the enclosed.\nMrs. M. saw first a two-branched cross. But it is to be noted that\nbefore I decided upon drawing a cross made of five squares, I had thov\/iM of a\ntwo-branched cross, and given it up as too simple. It is the one she saw.\nAs for tlie star, she reversed the mental process, her first one being the best.\nOn April 1st I drew a heart. Mrs. M. saw it, drew it pretty accurately,\nand, thinking it might be a chicken, added two legs to it.\nThese two experiments were the only ones of their kind.\nPhite I. shows the diagrams used and the reproductions made l)y\nMrs. M.

The experiments of four successive evenings, April 25th to\n28th, failed.

After them is written \" a hand.\" The resemblance\nin this case between original and reproductions is only a slight one,\nbut it may be observed that all the drawings made by Mrs, M. on this\nday (including those which we have not reproduced) consist of curved\nlines, more or less approximating to circles, whereas all her drawings on\nApril 29th (see Plate) consist, roughly speaking, of straight lines.\nBefore receiving this second set of diagrams, we wrote to Mrs. Isi.\nasking for her account of the experiments, and she replied as follows : \u2014\nFlorence, May 5th, 1893.\nDeau Sir,\u2014Your letter of May 2ncl has just reached me. I was not aware\nthat Mr. Glardon had menti(med our experiments to you. I consented to\ntry theui with my friend because of my success when sitting with otliers last\nsummer and the preceding winter. I did not know until a few days ago\nthat I had caught any idea of Mr. Glardon's. He sent me a tracing of the\ncross and three stars after having received my productions.\nIn answer to your questions :\n1. Before trying these experiments at a distance, Mr. Glardon and I had\nnever attemjited anything of the kind.\n2. I made several attempts to reproduce Mr. Glardon's drawings before\nsending liim my notes, but how many I cannot say.* He told me he would\ntry on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays to \"send\" a message of a few\nwords, and on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays a drawing. We were to\nsit at a certain hour in the evening, making due allowance for the difference\nbetween Swiss and Italian time. Mr. Glardon has all my notes, and can,\ntherefore, give you more correct information than can I.\n3. I had not the slightest idea what kind of design Mr. Glardon would\nchoose. As he is a landscape artist, my most natural thought would bo that\nhe had selected some object in Nature.\nDid Mr. Glardon tell you that in the \"messages\" I had occasionally\ncaught not only his thought but some of his words '(\nHe has not told me\nwhich ones. I generally see the designs (with my eyes shut) as white\non black, or black on white or light grey. I draw usually with my\neyes closed. Sometimes the design stands out clear and comes quickly ;\nat other times there is much confusion, and many designs present\nthemselves more or less distinctly, but finally resolve into one which\nseems more precise than the preceding impressions.

M.\nCranmer Hall, Fakenham, Norfolk, A^jril 26\/;\/;, 1893.\nOn August 20th, 1884, I was staying at my father-in-law's house at Bury\nSt. Edmunds. I had left my father in perfectly good health about a fort-\nnight before. He was at home at this address. About August 18th I had\nhad a letter from my mother saying that my father was not quite well, and\nthat the doctor had seen him and made very light of the matter, attributing\nhis indisposition to the extreme heat of the weather.\nI was not in any way anxious on my father's account, as he was rather\nsubject to slight bilious attacks.\nI should add, though, that I had been spending that day, August 20th,\nat Cambridge, and should have stayed the night there had not a sort of\nvague presentiment haunted me that possibly there would be a letter from\nhome the next morning. Sly wife, too, had a similar strong feeling that if\nI stayed the night at Cambridge I might regret it. In consequence of this\nfeeling I returned to Bury, and that night woke up suddenly to find myself\nstreaming Avith perspiration and calling out :\n\" Something dreadful is\nhappening ; I don't know what.\" The impression of horror remained some\ntime, but at last I fell asleep till the morning.\nMy father, Sir Willoughby Jones, died very suddenly of heart disease\nabout 1 a.m. on August 21st.

Dream.\nOctober lOlh, 1891.\nMy residence, where I have lived for thirty years, is Avithin half a dozen\nmiles of St. David's Head, Pembrokeshire, occupying a farm and having the\npastorate of a small country Welsh Nonconformist church. I spent, how-\never, the greater part of May, 1890, in London, W. One mornhig during\nmy stay there. I was awoke by the postman's knock, who, as usual, threw\nhis letters [on] to the door mat within and passed on. Not wishing to get up\njust then, I again slept for a short time, all of which time became apparently\noccupied with a dream, in which I found myself in a crowded hall listening\nto a lecture by the Rev. D. C. D , M.A. (London), then Principal of\nT College, Breconshire. The lecturer's voice, always weak, was quite\ninaudible from where 1 was seated ; I strained to catch some remarks, .\nbut in vain. Some noises also outside the hall helped to drown his voice,\nand among the noises were the sounds of a band of music, which grew so\nloud eventually that the lecturer sat down. I got up from where I wa<3\nseated and went and sat beside him, and told him I was anxious to attend\nhis lectures at T College, and wished to know what were his present\nsubjects. He attempted to tell me, but the noises outside were still so loud,\nthat I was unable to understand what he said. After repeated attempts on\nIds part, I was able to catch the words '\n' Heaven \" and \" Hell.\" He, however,\nused a word in connection with each, which I was still unable to detect\nowing to the uproar still continuing. At last I discovered that this word was\n\" crises,\" and that the subjects he wished to inform me of were \"Crises in\nHeaven,\" \"Crises in Hell.\" All the circumstances of this dream were so\nvivid and strange that when I awoke, and while I was dressing, it entirely\noccupied my thoughts, and I was endeavouring to imagine what could have\nsuggested such a dream. On gohig downstairs I found that the only\nletter delivered that morning was for me, and was from my youngest\nson, then at Aberystwyth College, on opening which, to my great astonish-\nment, I found it wholly occupied with the name that had filled my dream\nand was then filling my thoughts, relating, after just a remark that\nhe was glad I was enjoying my stay in London, that on the previous\nSunday the Aberystwyth people and himself had had a great treat in\nhaving the Rev. D. C. D to occupy the pulpit of the chapel he was\nattending, and how he, being such a stranger to the place, had attracted\nimmense congregations, preached powerful sermons, and made the Sunday\nquite an event in the place. I did not know that the Rev. Principal had\nany intention of visiting Aberystwyth, nor had I any means of knowing.\nThe coincidence appeared to me very remarkable, that from the moment\nthat the letter wholly occupied with the name of the Rev. D. C.\nwas thrown on the mat, and during the whole of the time that it lay there\nunopened, he should also have filled my dream, and should connect, through\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1893.\nletter and dream combined, places so far distant and unconnected as London,\nBrecon, and Aberystwyth.\nThe strangest and most remarkable coincidence remains to be told. I\nmentioned above that in my dream Mr. D 's voice hi the lecture which\nI was endeavouring to hear, was inaudible owing to noises and music outside\nthe hall. Now, I returned from London here the end of May, and in course\nof a couple of months \u2014at the beginning of August\u2014my son came home from\nAberystwyth for midsummer holidays. One day at table, I related this\ndream in his hearing, and mentioned the strange concidence between it and\nthe letter. When I had tinished my sen said, \" Father, it is very strange\nthat on the Sunday night when Mr. D was preaching at the Tabernacle,\nAberystwyth, soon after the service began, there was a circus passing into\ntown, along the Ijack road on which abuts the chapel wall, and so great\nwas the noise and uproar of carriages, horses and crowd that for a long\ntime Mr. D could not be heard ; and much blame was tlu'own on the\nto wn authorities that they allowed a procession of that character to disturb\nthe Sunday services. \" It is but fair I should add that, though I have been once\nor twice at this chapel of Tabernacle at Aberystwyth, the lecture hall of\nmy dream did not correspond to it, l)ut the disturbing uproar of my London\ndream corresponded to that which appears to have occurred at the chapel in\nthat it proceeded from behind the lecturer or preacher and not from behind\nthe audience.\nMr. Lewis writes later :\n\u2014\nI have shown the account to my son, who is noAV hero\u2014who corroborates\nall that relates to him.\nThe Beconcl case comes from Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart, (one of the\npercipients in L. 953, printed above). Though the coincidence here is\nless detailed than in the preceding case, the account has the advantage\nof having been written on the day of the incident.\nL. 955. Dream.\nVentnor, March 23rd, 1891.\nI was called at eight this morning, and my letters left outside the door. 1\nfell asleep again, and had what seemed a long and troublesome dream about a\ncheque which I had to lill up and sign. At nine I awoke, with a vivid recollec-\ntion of my dream, got up, opened a packet of letters forwarded from home,\nand found among them a registered letter containing a cheque for a large\nfum, which I had to sign as trustee. L. J. J.\nJST.B. \u2014I had no reason to expect the receipt of the cheque.

She\nlived in tlie city of Buenos Ayres, and I was living some distance outside.\nOn one particular night I dreamt I saw my fiancee walking along one of\nthe streets of Buenos Ayres, when a man crossed over the road and took her\nup in his arms and walked along a little way with her in that position ;\nI at\nthis point, however, woke up. The man was a friend of my fiancee's, of\nwhom I had often heard her speak, and 1 recognised him in my dream from\nhaving seen his photograph in my fiancee's album. Two days after my\ndreani I received a letter from my fiancee saying she had been to church on\nSunday morning, and whilst inside had not felt very well (being subject to\nfainting tits), so\u00b0had left the church, and walked up the street, accompanied\nby the very gentleman whom I had seen in my dream. When they arrived\nin front of the Hotel Provence, my fiancee was feeling so faint she could pro-\nceed no further, and the gentleman was obliged to pick her up in his arms\nand carry her into the hotel, where she had one of her fainting fits.\nThe theory of th's phenomenon I can only explain by supposing thought-\ntransmission at the time of the writing of the letter, which thought remained\ndormant in my brain, ti'l let loose when in a condition of sleep, and so\nmade manifest.\nJ.

Ill\nMr. Solovioff of mistranslating Madame Blavatsky's letter, and also\nattacked Mr. Solovioff's private character. Mrs. Besant threatened\nthat if the S.P.R. published Mr. Solovioff's account, Madame Zhelik-\nhovsky's attack on him would be published also.\nMr. Leaf, in reply, remarked that he was probably the only person\nin the room who had read the whole controversy tlu'ough from be-\nginning to end\u2014Mr. Solovioff's narrative, Madame Zhelikhovsky's\nattacks, and Mr. Solovioff's replies. Madame Zhelikhovsky had\nadmitted the genuineness of Madame Blavatsky's letter, and withdrawn\nthe attack in question on the correctness of the translation. He added\nthat it was intended, with Mr. Solovioff's account, to publish at least\nan abstract of Madame Zhelikhovsky's attack and Mr. Solovioff's answer.\nThe members of the Society who wished to form an independent\njudgment on the matter in dispute would wait till they had the whole\ncase before them, but in the meanwhile he might say that, after care-\nfully considering the whole of it, he had himself no doubt of the\ntrustworthiness of Mr. Solovioff's account.\nProfessor Barrett then read a paper on the alleged evidence in\nfavour of the Divining Rod.\nThe object of tlie paper was to bring before the Society an account\nof some experiments on the Divining Rod, which the author had\nrecently been enabled to make, and also to place on record a continua-\ntion of the report of cases in which the Divining Rod had been\nsuccessfully used to find underground springs or mineral lodes. The\nauthor referred to the previous report on this subject by Mr. E. R.\nPease, which appeared in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., and gave\na summary of the conclusions at which Mr. Pease had arrived, and\nwith which he substantially agreed. The subject itself was one which\nat first sight appeared wholly unworthy of notice, still less of serious\nscientific investigation ; but a beHef which is so widespread and so\nlong continued, and which has led to so many successful commercial\nundertakings in the sinking of wells and opening of mines, renders\nit one of those matters which the S. P. R. was founded to investigate.\nAfter a brief historical review the author adduced numerous cases\nof the successful use of the Divining Rod hj Mr. Lawrence, the oldest\nliving of the diviners or dowsers, and who is greatly respected in his\nown neighbourhood ; of Mr. Mullins, who has perhaps the largest and\nmost remarkable record of cases of water-finding ; of Mr. Mere-\nweather, Mr. Stears, Mr. Tompkins, and the lad Fred Rodwell, and\nothers who use the rod professionally. An account of the author's\nexperiments with Rodwell and Mr. Stears was then given, which were\ninconclusive ;\nthough one or two striking indications were made, yet\nthe result with metal concealed in boxes, &c,, was not beyond chance\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1893.\ncoincidence. Illustrations were then given of amateur diviners, one of\nthe most striking being a case sent by Miss Grantham.\nProfessor Barrett stated as his conclusion that there is a remark-\nably strong 'primil facie case in favour of the usefulness of the\nindications through the Divining Rod, and that had he to sink a well\nin a certain limited area he would prefer to trust to the opinion of a\nwater-finder like MuUins or Lawrence, however that may be arrived at,\nthan to the wisdom of a geological expert. Proceeding to discuss the\nexplanation of the water-finder's success, he showed that any physical\ntheory of the action of the rod only lands us in absurdities, and that,\ntherefore, it is in some peculiar psychological state of the diviner\nthat explanation must be sought. This he believed to be similar\nto that in which automatic writing is obtained. The diviner, he\nsuggested, allows his mind to be dominated by the object of his quest,\nsay the finding of an underground spring, whereupon he is so consti-\ntuted that an abnormal keenness of faculty arises, and signs indicative\nof the presence of water, though quite unappreciable to those around,\nare detected and transmitted to the brain ; and here, instead of\narousing any consciousness of the fact, a purely reflex action is excited,\nwhich results in a muscular twitch that turns the rod held between\nthe fingers.\nMe. Page Hopps said a few words, expressing himself as specially\ninterested in the fact that Professor Barrett was convinced of the\ngenuineness of the power of water-finders, though his own experiments\nwere inconclusive. He thought that the conditions required for\nexperiments often interfered with psychical phenomena.\nTHOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE OBTAINED THROUGH\nTABLE-TILTING.\nThe following account of some experiments in table-tilting\nwas sent to us by Professor Alexander, of Rio de Janeiro, in March,\n1892.\nHe writes :\nDr. Barcellos is a gentleman who resides at Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro,\nwhere he not only has a considerable practice, but is also generally esteemed\nas an honourable and sensible man. Having studied hypnotism, he was\ndesirous of witnessing some of the allied facts to be observed in psychical\nresearch. Towards the middle of last year we agreed to hold formal sittings\nat his house with the purpose of eliciting, if it were possible, physical\nphenomena. We devoted Monday evenings to our investigations, the circle\nbeing composed, with the exception of myself, of members of the doctor's\nown family. Ponna Maria de Villas Boas Barcellos, a school teacher, wbo\n\fJuly, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 113\nacted as medium, has, if table tilting be no proof to the contrary, arrived at\nyears of mature discretion. She is Dr. Barcellos' sister-in-law, and the\nmother of five children. The few sittings held began on the 31st of August,\n1891, and were discontinued about the end of October of the same year.\nThey were subject to much interruption by children and visitors, and were\nfinally stopped when Donna Maria was appointed to a school at a distance.\nWith the exception of some slight crepitations, more felt than heard, the\nseances, so far as physical phenomena go, were a failure. The lady, doubtless,\nmoved the table herself, although she did not seem to be aware of it. As for\nthe messages, they were nearly always of a trivial character, and occasionally\nthey were false. There seems, however, to have been a noticeable percen-\ntage of verifiable truth in what came through Donna Maria's automatism.\nBefore our. sittings began, this lady was seated at the me-M fallante (speaking-\ning-table) with members of her own family when the presence of her father,\nthen deceased, was announced. He was asked to give the names of the\npeople present. This he did, including that of a boy who was not in the\nroom at the time, with the information that he had just fallen down in the\nmud. Immediately afterwards the little fellow came into the room crying\nand confirmed the statement made through the table. The sitters, who were\nonly seeking for amusement, became frightened and abandoned all further\nexperiments. At our own sittings, among much that was wearisome and\nunprofitable, a few encouraging incidents occurred. On one occasion\n(October 26th, 1891) Dr. Barcellos asked mentally about the state of a young\nlady patient who was ill of smallpox. The table replied that she would\ndie on the following morning at eight o'clock. She did not die, but at the\nhour mentioned she became much worse. On another occasion, after I had\nretired, details were given about the private life of an individual who lived in\nVassouras, up country, which were by no means flattering to him. A Seiihor\nLozada, the doctor's brother-in-law, who was standing away from the table,\nwas the only person present who had previously known of these particulars.\nHe declared that the information thus obtained was exact.\nSo much for the general character of our sittings, of which I give an\nidea, so that the incident I am about to relate may not have more than its\ndue importance.\nOn the 21st of September, 1891, I was seated at the table with\nDr. Barcellos, his niece Sylvia, and Donna Maria Barcellos, when the words\ncame, \" The vase is broken.\" We asked what vase. \"(The vase) at your\nhouse, the vase of phenic acid.\" I demanded the hour, and the reply was,\n\"At eight o'clock.\" Of this an immediate note was taken at my request by\none of the children seated at another table. I transferred this note to my\npocket-book where it reads as follows :\n\u2014\n\"21st of September, 1891. \u20140 vaso se quebrou\u2014 De sua casa\u2014O vaso de\nacido phenico\u2014As 8 horas.\"\nI at once looked at my watch. It wanted some four or five minutes\nto eight. I knew, however, that it was not going well at the time, and I\nforgot to compare it afterwards with the right time. When this message\nhad been given Sylvia Barcellos rose from her place, and Went into the\ndining-room, where she told the others what had happened. Some visitors\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1893.\nwho were there spoke of retirmg ; but they were urged to stay, as it was\nonly eight o'clock\u2014 the hour then marked by the timepiece on the wall.\nThus a lucky chance determined the time of the message, which my careless-\nness in neglecting to see how much I was out might have left in doubt.\nI did not at first suppose that the above words had any more importance\nthan other things that came through the table. It was, therefore, an\nagreeable surprise when on a subsei^uent occasion Dr. Barcellos told me that\nthe message had been confirmed. I wrote down a re'siune of his statement,\nwhich I now copy from ray note-book :\n\"Donna M. on arriving home was being told of fright, when she\ninterrupted them, telling them what had come through table. They had just\nremarked time (eight o'clock) and went to give food to sick cliild\u2014 when noise\nof breakage. They exclaimed, '\nO vaso de acido plienico se quebrou.' In\ntruth, the jug had been upset by the dog, and had fallen against the vase of\nphenic acid, making the noise.\"\nNeither the vase in question, which was of porcelain, nor the water-jug\nwas really broken. The cause of the accident was a dog that had got into\nthe room where the sick child lay. The animal had, no doubt, endeavoured\nto drink out of the jug, which was standing on the fioor near a chair.\nThe house where Donna Maria was then living is situated about a kilo-\nmetre's distance from Dr. Barcellos' residence, so that the explanation by\nhypera3sthesia of the hearing\u2014in a jDerson who could hardly be said to be out\nof her normal condition\u2014seems to me to be absurd. Yet the lady was no\nclairvoyant, for the vase was not really broken. Even if her character were\nnot above suspicion, she could not have arranged the incident beforehand,\nfor a dog does not take part in a plot. The coincidence in time, and the\nexact mention of what was supposed to have occurred, renders mere chance\nan extremely unlikely element. We are therefore limited to one hypo-\nthesis\u2014the emotional impression of the girls who exclaimed, \" O vaso de\nacido phenico se quebrou,\" influenced their mother telepathically, and the\ntable was the means of bringing to the surface the message which her sub-\nconsciousness had received.\nAlfred Alexander.\nRio de Janeiro, March 21st [1892].\nThe evidence of the other witnesses was given in Portuguese, of\nwhich we print English translations, kindly furnished by Professor\nAlexander.\nIt was a little past eight when the visitors who were with me in the\ndining-room in the evening of the 2l8t of September,' 1891, spoke of\nretiring\nLuizA Barcellos.\nOn the 21st of September, 1891, 1 witnessed a curious fact in telepathy.\nAt that date, at eight o'clock in the evening, various persons in a house in the\nRua de Donna Marianna heard a strange noise in the room of a smallpox\npatient, and ran into it, crying out that in all probability the vase of phenic\nacid had been broken. Donna Maria Barcellos, my sister-in-law, one of\nher daughters, Sylvia Barcellos, Senhor Alfredo Alexander, and I were at\n\fJuly, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 115\ntliat hour seated at a small round table, when it was announced that in the\nabove-mentioned house, in the Rua de Donna Marianna, a vase of phenic\nacid had been broken. Donna Maria Barcellos was much astonished when\nthey told her on her going home to the Rua de Donna Marianna that they had\nhad a great fright at eight o'clock in the evening. She replied that she\nwas already aware that it was a vase of phenic acid which had been\nbroken. Then they explained to her that such had been the general\nsupposition in the house, that when they ran into the room they all\nexclaimed, \"The vase of phenic acid has broken,\" and tliat on entering\nthey discovered that a jug of water standing near a chair had fallen against\nthe vase of phenic acid.\nThese facts passed in the presence of Professor Alexander, who was\nalso at the table with my sister-in-law and Sylvia.\n(Signed) Dk.

It\nwas a bright clear day and I was standing close to the wall watching in the\ndistance two vessels on the sea, one having left the place I was at, and the\nother advancing from the opposite shore. To my surprise I saw that neither\nvessel, as they neared each other, seemed to make room for the other, and\nthen to my horror one dashed into the other, cutting her in half. I saw the\nboiler burst of the injured vessel, throw up fragments and thick black smoke ;\nI saw the passengers hurled into the water making frantic attempts to save\nthemselves. I especially noticed hats and other things floating on the water,\nand then suddenly two bodies were washed up at my feet, and I woke and\nfound it was nearly 8.30 a.m. The dream made a vivid impression on me,\nand I could not shake oflT the feeling of liorror I had experienced all through\nit. That same afternoon news came from Ostend of a terrible catastrophe\nin the Channel, the two vessels, Princesses Henriette and Josephine, cross-\ning via Ostend and Dover, had come into collision that same morning at\n10 a.m.,* the one had cut theotlier in half just as I had seen it in my dream ;\nindeed, the circumstances were the same. I knew no one on board, but the\nlady with whom, in my dream, I was staying , had three relatives on board ;\none was drowned and the other two saved.

My occupation is that of head\nteacher in one of the Board's Model Schools.\nAfter giving an account of an occasion when she saw an apparition\nof one of her assistants, who was absent at the time, and another\noccasion when she saw the apparition of an unknown person, Miss\nCleary says :\nWhen I was about 15 and at a convent boarding school, I dreamt,\nwithout any cause that could inspire it, that my father was ill, of details\nconnected with it, of his death, of results wliich followed. When the bell\nrang for getting up, and the nun came round to wake us, I, who had been\nroused from my painful chain of visions, was sitting in my nightdress on the\nside of the bed, and so faint-looking that the lady insisted I should return\nto bed. But this I would not do. I was too territied, and yet so glad it was\n\"only a dream.\" This was Friday. On Sunday morning came the bad\nnews : \"Kate, \u2014Father is very ill ;\npray for him.\" And so commenced the\nchain of sad realities pictured so graphically to me.\nIn answer to our inquiries. Miss Cleary wrote further :\nFebruary 26th, 1892.\nIn reference to the dream previous to my father's death, you ask me if\nI can give further details, dates, and corroboration, and \" did it happen at\nthe beginning of his illness, or before or after it ?\n\"\nWell, I think the only important detail I did not mention, or, at least,\nlay stress on, is that it was the sound of the bell for rising which broke the\nchain of pictures that were being presented to me\u2014that I was sent for to go\nhome (we lived in Roscrea, Co. Tipp., where the convent is) ; that I did go\nhome ; that I turned to go to the bedroom that had always been occupied\nby him ; that mother, close behind me, motioned me to an opposite room,\nuihich had never been used as a bedroom; that I went in, saw the bed in a\ncertain position, head towards this wall, foot that ; that Dr. R. was to-\nwards the foot of the bed, holding in his hand a white china tea-cup, with\nlilac flower pattern\u2014one of a set we had ; that on the window was a very\npeculiar new style of lace curtain, the pattern of which I had never seen\nanywhere. I dreamt he died, and of the grief and terrible trouble ; and\nabout this part there was, as it were, a cloud, and one distinct figure loomed\nfrom it\u2014that of an uncle, father's brother, Dr. James Cleary, of Dublin,\n(27, N. Earl-street), deceased since. I saw, or felt, that James took my\nonly brother back with him to Dublin.\nEvery detail of the dream was verified. Now, with me, this dream is\nunique in, if I may express myself so, its span.\nThe loud, rapid tones of the hand-bell rung in the dormitory roused me,\nand mechanically I sprang from bed, scarcely awake ; in a daze or stupor I was\nsitting on the side of it. The nun whose duty it was to go from bed to bed\nto make sure we had all arisen found me as I described, noted my ap-\npearance, shook me a little, told me 1 seemed very ill, and should lie down\n\fJuly, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Resexirch.\nagain. This aroused me quite. I would not have gone back to that bed\njust then for worlds. I told her I was not ill, that I had been dreaming,\nand dreamt that my father was dead; but she \" would not listen to such\nnonsense, superstition, and folly, &c.\" (She is dead, and there is no one\nwho can corroborate.) I may have mentioned it to a companion ;\nI did not\nattempt to do so again to any of the imns.\nAt the time I had this dream I had every reason to believe that my\nfather was in perfect health ; and he was in perfect health. He was medical\ndoctor to the house. I had seen him a few days before from a window,\nwalking in the grounds with the Mother or Superioress. He looked then,\nas he always did, the embodiment of health and good humour. In com-\nparing dates and events afterwards with my mother, who, unhappily, is no\nmore, I found that the dream occurred ou the eve of hisfirst clai\/s indisposition.\nHe was attending a fever patient some miles from the town, got a severe\nwetting, which predisposed him to the infection, which he caught. He was\nbut 5 days ill. He died on the 19th July, 1853. I am now 52, therefore I\nwas not so much as 15 when he died. His death changed the whole course\nof my life, or, rather, shunted me quite on other lines.\nOn Wednesday morning I had the dream. On [the] saaie Wednesday he got\nthe wetting. Wednesday night he felt nervous and unwell, and had a hot foot-\nbath before going to bed. Thursday, I preswme he did not go out. I'm sure\nhe lay for the first time on Friday. Friday evening I first had any intimation\nof his illness. Then, my aunt, his sister, who was a nun there and one of my\nclass mistresses, told me that mother had sent word of it, with a request\nthat the nuns would pray for him, but she added :\n\" There is no cause for\nalarm.\" I recollect nothing particular about Saturday.\nOn Sunday morning 1 was called away from the breakfast table and told\nI was to dress for going home, to see my father, who had become worse. I\nwent and found as I had seen in my dream.\nMother told me afterwards that she was greatly shocked by my standing\nas I did at the threshold of the door, and that I seemed not to be able to\nkeep my eyes from the windows. The ro(jm and everything in the room\nwas as I had seen them in my dream\n.\nI know that father had been thinking of me particularly during the early\npart of the week in which he took ill, as I had had an earache. He sent me\na drug for it, which cured it at once, but he was not aware of the success of\nhis remedy. He asked me then, during this interval of consciousness while\nI made my short visit, how was the pain in the ear '?\nI said :\n\" Your little\nbottle cured it.\" (I had [the] same little bottle for many years.) He then\nkissed me and put his hand on my head and blessed me. The doctor then\nalmost pulled me away, and told mother to take me from the room.\nI remember well how unnaturally calm I was, and this calm, or apparent\ninsensibility, remained throughout his short illness, and when 1 heard of his\ndeath. Mother used often [to] remark how strange it all was, and how extra-\nordinary that I, who was the only child absent when he became ill, should\nbe the only one who received his sad farewell, and, as she said, \"It was\nfitting, too, for I was his favourite child.\" K. M. Cmary.\nIt will be observed that the day of the week on which the dream\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1893.\noccurred is given difFerently in the two accounts. Whether Dr.\ndeary's illness had actually begun or not at the time, it appears that\nthe dream took place during a period when at least there was no reason\nfor special anxiety about him, even on the part of his family at home,\nand when Miss Cleary herself had no reason for anxiety at all.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nON THE PRODUCTION OP SPURIOUS \" SPIRIT RAPS.\"\nTo the Editor of the .Jolrnal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nDear Sir, \u2014The so-called \"rajis,\" or percussive sounds, are, as is well\nknown, one of the most important of the physical phenomena of Spirit-\nualism ;\nindeed, I think they were the first to appear in time. It is not my\nintention in any way to disparage the existing evidence for them, and I, for\nmy part, am very much inclined to believe that genuine \" spirit rappings\n\"\ndo really exist, though I have, as I will presently show, very good grounds\nfor being sceptical on this point.\nIt is now about 4 or 5 years since I discovered that I, too, was a good\nrapping medium. Very loud raps\u2014such as striking with a small hammer\nbegan to be heard in niy presence, when I was walking about the room or\nstanding \u2014in good light ; also when I was sitting, but feebler. To satisfy\nthe curiosity of the \" investigators,\" or, as I said, to convince them of the\ngenuineness of the phenomenon, I could cause these raps to appear in\ndifferent places : now in a table, now in a door, in a mantel-piece, and so\non. Several times I would ask a friend to sit upon my knees to make him\nfeel sure that not a muscle of my legs moved, and the raps would come all\nthe same, even louder than usual. And last, not least, after having stood in\nall possible ways \u2014now on tiptoe and now on one foot only\u2014I would place\nmyself upon something soft, e.g., standing upon the cushion of a chair,\nand the raps would still be perfectly audible. I have some reason to\nbelieve that had I wished, I might have very easily acquired the reputa-\ntion of a powerful physical medium. Some time since I happened to call\non a well-known and highly respectable lady Spiritualist here, and during\nour conversation my \" unseen guides \" suddenly announced their presence\nin the usual way. Some sentences were rapj^ed nut, one of them backwards,\nto the great amazement of the lady, who spelt out the alphabet. And later\non a still more remarkable test was given, words written in pellets by the\nlady being correctly spelt out by the raps. Now I had better say at once\nthat in this particular case, as well as in general, there was nothing\nmediumistic about my raps at all, and that I was the agent consciously and\nvoluntarily producing them. And yet, when, after having amused myself\nat the lady's expense, I thought it my duty to write to her saying it was all\na trick and explaining my modus operandi, not only was she greatly\nastonished but even replied as follows: \u2014\"Your letter has astonished me\ngreatly, and were it not you that told me so, I would never have believed\nthat you could have deceived me. You have a wonderful faculty, for I did\nnot notice any movement whatever on your part. It is true I did not watch\n\fJuly, 1893.] Joxbrnol of Society for Psychical Research. 121\nyour feet very closely, except, however, in one instance, of which I have\nbeen thinking much without being able to understand it. [Then she\ndescribes an experiment in which I caused tlie raps to appear whilst standing\non a remboim-ee chair.] I am perfectly unable to comprehend against what\nyou could have rapped then; for the sounds did take place, and I heard\nthem most undoubtedly, as well as you, no doubt. Pray explain in detail\nhow you did that.\" &c.\nIt is time, perhaps, to state plainly what my trick consists of. The raps\nin question are produced by the 2nd and 3rd toes of my left foot, with\nwhich I strike the floor violently. Perhaps the word drike is not quite\ncorrect, and I should rather say that I bend and unbend them. Of course,\na person watching my feet very closely will detect the trick with little diffi-\nculty ; but standing with the back to the light, or even en jrrofile, but so as\nto let the light fall upon the right foot, leaving the left in the shade, will\nmake the work of detection far less easy.\nThen, if I place my foot against the leg of a table, the raps will,\napparently, come from the table ; and in doing this very little contact is\nnecessary. For making the raps sound in a door the modus operandi is the\nsame ; and if the door be made of glass the raps will have a different sound\naltogether ; in fact, if the foot be conveniently placed the raps will have the\nsame sound as if they did actually proceed from the object in question.\nThe size of the room makes a great difference in the loudness of the raps :\nthe smaller the room the louder the sounds. One of the \"favourable con-\nditions \" is also to have the muscles of the foot strained as much as possible.\nThus, standing upon the left foot only, or leaning upon it, or sitting cross-\nlegged with the knees propped violently against the table will not hinder\nthe raps\u2014on the contrary.\nNow, with the exception of the lady above referred to, I have never\nattributed to my raps a supernatural origin, and still, in more than one\ncase, the friend to whom I showed them was unable to detect their origin.\nNow, had I always pretended to be a medium, it is quite possible that my\nmodus operandi would never have been detected. \" Spirits \" might retire\nor refuse to act, and so on, as the \" investigator \" became too inquisitive, and\nno blame could have been thrown on me, whilst with myself as the avowed\nagent producing the \"phenomena,\" no such excuse was possible.\n1 may add that during a short stay I made in England last summer I\nshowed my raps to several of the leading members of our Society, such as\nProfessor and Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. W. Leaf, and Mr. G. A. Smith. I have\nthought it worth while to put the subject in writing, for 1 have no doubt\nthat such a faculty is very rare, and, besides, may possibly give a clue to\nsome apparently inexplicable performances of professional mediums. In\nconclusion I must state again my belief that there do exist raps of an alto-\ngether different origin from those I produce and have described.\u2014I am,\ndear sir, yours very truly, Michael Petrovo-Solovovo.\n9, Mohovaia, St. Petersburg.\nMay 24:th-June 5th, 1893.\nP.S. \u2014As for the raps being heard whilst I was standing upon a soft chair,\nthey were produced in that case by my toes striking against the sole of the\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

MYERS ON THE MECHANISM OP HYSTERIA.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir, \u2014I should be glad, if permitted, to write a few lines sviggested by\nthe first part of Mr. Myers' paper, having been prevented from attending\nthe meeting at which it was read. I allude to that part of it in which he\nspeaks of sensory and motor automatism as forming the basis of the psychical\nscheme.\nThe crude partition of nervous action into motor and sensory is, as he\nremarks, unsatisfactory. All nervous centres are kinesthetic and the circle\nof nervous action is continuous throughout. Let us trace its continuity in\nrespect of a simple voluntary action, and then see how it bears upon the\nquestion of automatism.\nI see, let us suppose, a ripe peach hanging on a wall ; this suggests the\nact of plucking it. That is, the sensation of roundness, colour, &c., which\nexperience associates with a certain flavour, provokes the motor act. But\nthe act, when accomplished, in turn conveys a sensation of muscular move-\nment ; and thus the motor suggestion becomes in turn a sensory experience.\nIn fact, the first suggestion, in the mind, of plucking the peach, is a rehearsal\nof the accomplished act, i.e., of the sensations which the act produces.\nBut it is evident that all day long, sensations are being presented to us\nwhich are not strong enough to reach the level of consciousness. Thus, as\nwe walk the streets, or scan the sheets of a nevpspaper, names, notices, and\nadvertisements pass before our eyes, of the great bulk of which we are\nmercifully unconscious. But this is not necessarily because the stimulus is\ntoo weak, absolutely, but because it is relatively inadequate to make itself\nfelt among the complex of sensations to which our attention is consciously\ndirected. If, however, we had no such preoccupation, and if the name,\nnumber, or whatever it is, came before our eyes singly, we could scarcely\navoid noticing it, and even as it is, it may so nearly have gained our atten-\ntion that, when reminded of it, we are conscious of having seen it before.\nHere we are on the borderland of automatism. But now taking the case\nwhere no conscious memoi'y can be evoked, what happens '? The stimulus\nremains latent until the cessation of conflicting impulses permits it to\nmake itself felt. In the case of motor automatism this occurs when the hand\nis allowed to lie passive on the planchette, and the conscious attention is\nprevented from interfering, by being withdrawn to other topics. Hence\nfollow those experiments in which the subject reads from a book while his\nhand is tracing the automatic message. The object is to withdraw the\nhigher centres from participation in the manual act which would mar the\neffect of the weak stimulus we are considering. The hand then performs\nthe motor act of which the abortive sensory suggestion had been made\nperhaps weeks, or months, before. Or there may be a sequence of stimuli\neach too weak to act singly, but which in the sum total may overflow into a\nconscious voluntary act.\nThe case is quite different with sensory automatism, in that to produce\n\fJuly, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 123\nthe passive abstraction which is desirable, all conflicting sensory stimuli\nmust be withdrawn, hence, perhaps, the frequency of hallucinations in the\nstillness and darkness of the night\u2014although it must be confessed that this\nrelative frequency is not as great as we should have, a priori, expected. In\nsensory automatism we may suppose that the impulse, instead of taking the\nmotor path, expends itself in sensations of a character either identical with,\nor correlated to, that from which the stimulus originally proceeded.\nIn both motor and sensory automatisnr we thus realise only the second of\nthe two sensory processes which I endeavoured to illustrate in the case of\nplucking a peach. The initial sensory impulse is lost sight of, and the\nautomatic message appears to us as though coming from a source external to\nour own organism ; and this idea, once entertained, may itself operate sug-\ngestively, and impart to the message an assumed character, spiritistic,\nsupernatural, or what not.\nSo far we seem to trace, with some approach to clearness, the history of\nsensori-motor automatism, when originating, and expending itself within the\norganism. But with the introduction of an assumed external agent, acting\ntelepathically, we enter upon different ground altogether. Nevertheless,\nafter the first stimulus, from wheresoever proceeding, is received, the\nmechanism is probably the same. The whole difficulty consists in consider-\ning how a sensory stimulus can be centrally initiated, ah extra, without its\nadopting the usual afferent nervous path from the end organs of the senses.\nAnd here, in default of any scientific explanation of how this can be, we\nmust rely upon evidence of the fact, and upon evidence alone. It is nothing\nnew in science that facts should be accepted which cannot be accounted for.\nIt was known, and universally admitted, that scarlet fever was epidemic, and\nthat vaccination was prophylactic, long before the modern theory of zymotic\ndisease was so much as dreamt of.\nI cannot follow Mr. Myers into quasi-Pythagorean speculations, Init\nthere is one point on which I should like to throw out a suggestion for his\nconsideration. He seems to look forward to a future state of added joowers,\nintensified perceptions, and extended faculties, whether new, or resurgent\nfrom some ante-natal past, it matters not. But may not the case rather be\nthat with the putting off of the mortal coil we may also divest ourselves of the\nportion of our being which in a thousand ways blinds our intellect, con-\nfounds our judgment, and misleads our moral sense ? Some meaning of\nthis sort seems to be involved in the expression\u2014\"to see things in the light\nof eternity \"\u2014and some approach to it surely is to be fotmd in the in-\ngenuousness of childhood, before the conventionalities, the artifices, and the\ninsincerities of adult life have, by constant repetition, become a second\nnature. In a world where jjossibly the thoughts of the heart are as open to\nobservation as the features of the face are now, a difference of moral\nstandard, perhaps also of moral achievement, would result greater than we\ncan even imagine ; and this increase of intuitive power might proceed, not\nfrom added faculties, but from the removal of the carnal framework which,\nwhile the building up of the spiritual temple is progressing, hides it like\nscaffolding from view, and which, when removed, will display the completed\nfabric in its full proportions and thenceforth immutable outline.\nThomas Barkworth,\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

He invited our Society to co-operate in this Congress ; and\nour Council, anxious to show their appreciation of Colonel Bundy's\nstraightforward work, authorised me to attend the Congress as its\nrepresentative, and to read such papers as members of the Council\nmight entrust to me. Colonel Bundy died somewhat suddenly on\nAugust 6th, 1892, and Professor Elliott Coues was selected by the\nofficials of the World's Congress Auxiliary to succeed him as Chair-\nman, Dr. Richard Hodgson, our Secretary for America, succeeding\nProfessor Coues as Vice-Chairman. The \" Committee on a Psychical\nScience Congress \" included various names well known and honoured\nin Chicago. A Ladies' Committee was also formed, at the head of\nwhich was Mrs. Bundy, Colonel Bundy's widow, who has succeeded him\nin the editorship of the Religio-Pliilosophiccd Journal. The Congress\nassembled on Mondaj^, August 21st, and sat twice or thrice a day, con-\ncluding its sessions on Friday evening, August 25th. The attendance\nwas unexpectedly large, varying, I believe, from about five hundred to\nabout a thousand persons. Their continued attention was the more\ngratifying inasmuch as the Congress, overflowing the quiet and con-\nvenient hall first assigned to it in the Memorial Art Palace at Chicago,\nhad to be held in a huge temporary hall of bad acoustic properties,\nand exposed to the almost continuous noise of a large adjacent railway\nstation.\nThe papers sent from England were mainly occupied with the\nrecapitulation in popular form of results already published. Dr. Leaf\nsent \" Elementary Hints on Experimental Hypnotism,\" and a paper\non \" Mme. Blavatsky and M. Solovyolf \"\n; Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick\nsent a paper on \"Veridical Hallucinations as a Part of the Evidence\nfor Telepathy \" ; Mr. Podmore a paper on \" Experimental Thought-\nTransference,\" and Professor Lodge a paper on \" The difficulty of\nmaking crucial experiments as to the source of the extra or unusual\nintelligence manifested in trance-speech, automatic writing, and other\nstates of apparent mental inactivity.\" Dr. Hodgson addressed the Con-\ngress on \"Human Testimony in Relation to Psychical Phenomena,\" and\nI upon \" The Subliminal Self \" and \" The Evidence for Man's Survival\nafter Death.\" It is hoped that these papers, presenting a kind of elemen-\ntary survey of the main fields of the Society's work, may be printed\ntogether in a form convenient for students. Among papers containing\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct.,\nmatter of evidential interest I may mention a report by Profesior and\nMrs. Coues \" On the Alleged Movement of Objects without Mechanical\nContact,\" giving an account of some private experiments ;\npapers by Mr,\nand Mrs. Underwood, containing the record of automatic writings of\nwhich mention has already been made in our Proceedings ;\na paper\nby Mrs. Kuntz Rees on \"Experimental Crystal-Gazing,\" and one by\nDr. Wiltse on \"Some Experiments in Thought-Transference, and their\nSignificance.\" Dr. Finzi, in whose house the well-known Milan series\nof experiments with Eusapia Paladino was carried out, was present,\nand gave an account of those experiments fully concordant with Pro-\nfessor Richet's description, already noticed in our Proceedings. Our\ncorresponding member in Brazil, Professor Alexander, sent a long\nand careful account of psychical phenomena in that country ;\nan account\nwhich will, I hope, be printed. Finally, Judge A. H. Dailey read part\nof an interesting and important monograph\u2014which is, I trust, soon to\nappear in book form\u2014upon Miss Mollie Fancher, an invalid lady who\nhas long been well known by report to students of our subjects as\nexhibiting various supernormal powers, but of whom no adequate\naccount has yet been published. Among other papers of interest I\nmay mention that on \" The Spiritualistic Interpretation of Psychic\nPhenomena,\" by the Rev. Minot J. Savage; that on \"Memory in\nRelation to Psychical Experiences,\" by Mr. Charles Whedon ;\nthat on\n\" So-called Spirit-Photographs,\" by Professor Coues ;\nthat on \" Hypnotic\nSuggestion,\" by Dr. C. G. Davis ; on \" The Etiological Significance of\nHe\u00b0teroceneous Personality,\" by Dr. Smith Baker; on \"The Theosophical\nSociety\u2014a Critical Historical Review,\" by Mr. W. Emmette Coleman ;\non \"The History of Spiritualism,\" by Mr. A. R. Wallace;^ on\n\"Dreams, considered from the Standpoint of Psychical Science,\" by\nDr. Edmund Montgomery ; and on \"The Relation of Consciousness to\nits Physical Basis,\" by Professor E. D. Cope.\nThese and other papers have for the most part been reported at\nconsiderable length in the Religio-Philosophiccd Journal, which was\nthe official organ of the Congress. The question of the subsequent\npublication of all or any of them in a more permanent form is not yet\ndecided.\nThe Congress was, I believe, regarded at Chicago as successful; and\nit certainly supplied a most encouraging indication of the serious and\ngrowing interest taken in our studies in a city which has a perhaps\nunique claim to represent the future of the Western World. While, of\ncourse, our Society was not identified with the Congress in any way\nbeyond the fact that one of its Secretaries was Yice-Chairman, and\nanother was present to represent the Council of the S.P.R., we may\nnevertheless hope that collaborators of value will be won for us by\n\fOoT, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research..\nthe opportunities of setting forth the Society's modes of experiment,\nand evidential standards, which this great assemblage afforded. Per-\nsonally, Dr. Hodgsoa and I owe sincere thanks to various friends, and\nespecially to Mr. Lyman J. Gage, for help and encouragement of the\nutmost value. Frederic W. H. Myers.\nCASES SUPPLIED TO THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nWe \"ive below a number of cases of apparitions seen\u2014or, in the\nlast instance, a voice [heard\u2014collectively. It is difficult to apply to\nthese cases, as described, the explanation of mistaken identity, and no\nother alternative view of them seems possible.\nIn the first two an apparition of the same person is seen more\nthan once. In the first case additional evidence of the hallucinatory\ncharacter of the figure seen is afi^orded by the details having been\nmore clearly discernible than those of a real figure at the same distance\nwould have been, and also by the second appearance, where there was\ntransportation of scene.\nL, 958. Collective Apparition.\nFrom the Misses H. M. and L. Bourne.\nMiss L. Bourne writes :\n\u2014\n\"On February 5th, 1887, my father, sister, and I went out hunting.\nAbout the middle of the day my sister and I decided to return home with\nthe coachman, while my father went on. Somebody came and spoke to us,\nand delayed us for a few moments. As we were turning to go home, we\ndistinctly saw my father, waving his hat to us and signing us to follow lum.\nHe was on the side of a small hill, and there was a dip between him and us.\nMy sister, the coachman, and myself all recognised my father, and also the\nhorse. The horse looked so dirty and shaken that the coachman remarked\nhe thought there had been a nasty accident. As my father waved his hat\nI clearly saw the Lincoln and Bennett mark inside, though from the distance\nwe were apart it ouglit to have been utterly impossible for me to have\nseen it. At the time I mentioned seeing the mark in the hat, though the\nstrangeness of seeing it did not strike me till afterwards.\n\"Fearing an accident, we hurried down the hill. From the nature of\nthe ground we had to lose sight of my father, but it took us very few\nseconds to reach the place where we had seen him. When we got there,\nthere was no sign of him anywhere, nor could we see anyone iii sight at all.\nWe rode about for some time looking for him, but could not see or hear\nanything of him. We all reached home within a quarter of an hour of each\nother. My father then told us he had never been in the field, nor near the\nfield, in which we thought we saw him, the whole of that day. He had\nnever waved to us, and had met with no accident.\n\" My father was riding the only white horse that was out that day.\n\" Louisa Bourne.\n\" H, M.

It was on the 5th February, 1887, it happened,\nand in March the same year, when I was out walking alone, I thought I\nsaw papa and Paddy stop at a little plantation of his close to, and look at\nthe wall, which had fallen in [in] one part. He then appeared to ride a few\nyards towards me, but afterwards turned round and went back past the\nplantation and out of sight. When I went in I asked him if he had not\nseen me, and why he turned back, when it transpired he had not been past\nthat plantation all day, but had ridden home another way. He said it must\nhave been someone else on a white horse, and asked where I was when I\nsaw him, and then, not before, it dawned on me that it was utterly\nimpossible to see either plantation or wall from where I was. Since then I\nhave often been along the same road, and stood, and looked, and wondered\nhow it was I so distinctly saw the broken wall and papa on the white horse ;\na turn in the road makes my having really done so quite impossible. I am\nsorry I cannot give you the exact date of this : I know it was in March,\n1887', but cannot remember the day, except that it was not on the 5th. The\nother '\nexperience ' is, I always think, far more interesting, as having been\nseen by three, and also from the fact that Paddy was the only white or grey\nhorse in the hunting-field that day ; so that unbelievers could not say it was\nsomeone else on a white horse that we had mistaken, , , ,\n\"Nina M.

Miss\nBourne told me the stories of her seeing her father, first with her sister,\nand later by herself, and signed the account which she and her sister\nhad, she says, made out together about it.

The groom rode up to the ladies as they were looking, and\nsaid :\n'\nThe Canon is beckoning.

He\nis a heavy man, and his white horse, adapted to carry weiglit, was quite\nunlike any other horse in the neighbourhood. Everyone agrees as to the\nimpossibility of mistaking the horse. The horses of the neighbourhood\nwere well known to the neighbourhood in general and to the Miss\nBournes in particular, as they were at that time constantly out with the\nhounds. The incident seems quite unaccountable.\"\n\fOct., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nL. 959. Collective Apparition.\nThe nest case, obtained through the kindness of Mrs. Shield,\nrelates to apparitions of the Rev. H. Hasted, of Pitsea Rectory, Essex,\nwhich were seen by several different percipients, in two instances\ncollectively. The first account is given by two of Mr. Hasted's\nservants,\n'\n' Pitsea Rectory,\n''March 17th, 10.40a.m. [1892].\n\" Yesterday, at half-past eleven, N., the rat-catcher, came to see master,\nwho was out. We looked at the clock to tell N. when we thought he could\nsee master, who had ordered luncheon at 12.15. We were both outside the\ndoor when N. came. He was in a cart and had with him two dogs. He\ndrove on, and Mrs. Watts, looking down the road, said, ' Here comes the\nmaster '. '\nThen I saw him too, his dog with him. N. had just got\nbelow the front gate. We watched to see them meet ;\nwondered why\nN. did not stop to speak, as he wanted to see master. He drove right on.\nAbout that time we lost master ; couldn't think where he was, but fancied\nhe must have gone to Wilson's house. Wilson himself was standing lower\ndown, where the roads meet. We still watched, and when we couldn t\nsee him (master) come out we went indoors.\n\"When Mr. Hasted came home I wasn't going to say anything, but\nMrs. Watts asked if he had seen N., who wanted to tell him about a\npuppy. He said he had been at Mr. Williams's, and all the story came out.\n\"Eliza Smallbone.\n\" Jane Watts.\"\nMrs. Shield writes :\u2014\n\" 3Iarc]i mh, 10 i).m.\n\" This foreiroon for upwards of an hour, Mr. Hasted was here [at Mr.\nWilliams's] and I think it was from eleven to past twelve. He was writing and\nconversing. We met him again at the evening service, and he walked back\nwith us. At supper he related the curious circumstance [of his having been\nseen by the two servants]. Of all people in the world one would think\nthese old servants are the very least likely to make a mistake, and the road\nis straight and not long, nor is it much frequented.\"\nAfter making inquiries the next day, Mrs. Shield wrote further :\u2014\n\"Mrs. Watts, the cook-housekeeper, was not at home, but I saw Mr.\nHasted after taking down Ehza's evidence. He was expecting me, and told\nme Wilson would certify that he was where the women saw him, and that\nno person at all went up the lane. He saw N. drive down.\n\" Eliza thought it quite impossible they could make a mistake as to the\nperson they saw, and everyone here says the same. No one would expect\nto see him without his dog, but, in fact, the dog was here with hun.\"\nThe next account comes from two of Mrs. Shield's nieces. They\nsprite\n\" We saw Mr. Hasted distinctly in his everyday appearance coming\nup the carriage drive to the house ; watched him a few moments approaching\nthe inner gate, and, not wishing to be seen ourselves, we hid among\nthe shrubs by which he must pass.

We ascertained when we next met him that he had not been in the\ndirection of our garden at all tliat day.\n\"Floekxce Mary Williams.\n\"Lucy Hakriet Williams.\"\nMr. Hasted adds :\u2014\n\"Pitsea Rectory, July 22ncl, 1889.\n\"I beg to confirm Miss Williams's statement. At the time she thought\nshe saw me I was at least a mile from her.\nMrs. Shield says :\n\" Of this circumstance I was informed at the time, and remember it well.\"\nAnother lady. Miss ,\nliving at a neighbouring rectory, in 1890,\nthought she saw Mr. Hasted ride up to the gate, raise the latch with\nthe loop of his wliip and stoop down, pushing the gate open. She thought\nshe recognised the horse also, but found on inquiry that no one had been\nto the house. Of this incident we have only a second-hand account, as\nthe lady dislikes the subject, and objects to writing it out herself. It does\nnot appear to have made much impression on her.\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\n''April 4:th, 1892.\n\"I have to-day seen Mr. Hasted and the site of three of his appearances,\nas well as Miss Florence Williams, who was one of the percipients on the\nfirst occasion, and Mr. Hasted's two servants who were the percipients on\nthe last occasion\u2014last month.\n\"The appearance to Miss does not appear to me to come to very\nmuch, on account of distance and shrubs, which must have obstructed the\nview not a little. Miss is said, however, to have recognised the horse\na light-coloured one, unlike any others in tlie neighbourhood.\n\"The appearance to the servants, though out-of-doors and at a consi:ler-\nable distance, is certainly remarkable. They stood at the back door of the\nhouse, looking down tlie lane after tlie rat-catcher. The lane is perfectly\nstraight and open, and, say, 100 yards long or 150, to where it joins\nanother road at right angles. At the end of this lane the cook saw Mr.\nHasted and his dog coming towards the house, and almost before she\ncalled her fellow-servant's attention to him the latter saw him too. They\nsaw him pass the groom's (Wilson's) cottage, which is near the end of the\nlane, and anticipated his meeting the rat-catclier and the latter stopping to\nspeak to him. The rat-catcher's cart presently hid him from view, and when\nhe should have appeared on their side of the cart he was gone. They were\nsurprised, but supposed he must have turned and gone into Wilson's cottage,\nand thought no more of it. Wilson, however (whom I also saw), was\nstanding all the time at the end of the lane, and he is quite positive that\nthere was no one whatever in the lane at the time except the rat-catcher.\nMr. Hasted's peculiar way of walking and swinging his stick was noticed.\nHis dog is a brown and wliite spaniel, and there is no other like it in the\nneighbourhood except one kept tied up. The servants say they noticed this\n\fOor., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 133\ndog and tlie rafc-catcher's two dogs all at the same time. They struck me as\ngood witnesses. It is certain that it could not have been Mr. Hasted him-\nself because the servants had noticed the time just before (11.35) in order to\ntell the rat-catcher when they thought their master would be in, and at that\ntime Mr. Hasted was with Miss F. Williams and Mrs. Shield at Bowers\nGilford, and they also noted the time. Mr. Hasted was hurrying through\nsome work, wondering whether he should get it done in time to go home for\nlunch at 12.15.\n\" When Miss F. Williams and her sister (as children) saw him, he was\nalso coming along a straight road, the approach to the Rectory, towards\nthem. They watched him through some bushes as he approached. When\nhe got up to the garden gate, they withdrew more behind the bushes\nthat he might not see them, but neither he nor anyone else passed. The\nway to the back door leads off from the garden gate, and it seems just\npossible that the person they saw was not Mr. Hasted and was someone\nwho went to the back door. Their recognition of Mr. Hasted was, however,\nvery distinct. They do not remember hearing any steps going towards the\nback door; they believe that they asked, and found that no one had gone\nthere. It was a good many years ago.\n\"Mr. Hasted was also, we were told, supposed to have been seen on\nthe beach at Bournemouth by a lady friend lately, when he was not at\nBournemouth at all.\"\nG. 238.

McCaskill.\nThe account was enclosed in a letter dated July 25th, 1892.\n\"4, Shakespeare-road, Bedford,\n\"Last summer [August, 1891] I was paying a visit to some cousins,\nwho were en pension with a German family, at Cassel. My cousin L. V.\n[assumed initials] and I shared a room, known, from the stained window,\nas the '\nRitterzimmer.' Our beds occupied almost all one side of the room,\nof which I send a rough plan. One night we were late going to bed, and\nwere not in bed till after 11.30. We went on talking for some time. We\nwere neither of us the least nervous, nor was our conversation such as to\nmake us so. I remember we were talking about the opera Robert der Tenfel,\nto which we were going next day. We had stopped talking for a few\nminutes, and I was lying with my face to the wall, when I was\nstartled by a scream from my cousin, and, turning round, saw a tall white\nfigure standing in the room, near L.'s bed. I did not at the time feel\nfrightened;; my one idea was to find out what strange thing it was. It\nturned and came towards my bed, and I distinctly remember noticing that\nit made no sound on the polished wood floor. Its eyes were green and\nglistening, but the rest of the face seemed muffled up. As soon as it was\nclose to my bed, I seized it, and seemed to take hold of something soft,\nlike flimsy drapery, but whatever it was seemed dragged from me by some\ninvisible power, and the thing literally sank into the floor by my bedside.\nL. was in a perfect terror, and her mother, and G. von T., and another\nfriend were startled by the noise, and came to see what was the matter.\nWe searched everywhere, but nothing was to be seen. I cannot account\nfor not feeling afraid of it, especially as afterwards I heartily wished the\nnight were over. L. knew there was a legend about our room, and that\nthis apparition was said to come that day once in ten years, but she did\nnot believe in it, and I knew nothing at all of the story. The people\nwho had lived in the house before told Frau von T. that they had seen\nsomething twice in that room. They had lived there over 20 years ; but\nFrau von T. had not been there long enough to test it before. No one\ncould possibly have got into the room, as the door was a very noisy one,\nclose to the foot of my bed. We slept in the room for some time, botli\nbefore and after, but never saw anything more. As my cousin and I\nboth saw the '\nthing, ' I am at a loss to account for it, but I should be\nextremely sorry to sleep in that room that day ten years.\n\"Agnes McCaskill.\n\" N.B.\u2014My cousin and I wrote out our accounts of this just afterwards,\nand her account is a copy of that one.\"\nMiss L. V. writes :\n\u2014\n'\n' My cousin and myself slept together in a room called the Ritter-\nzimmer. The room I knew was supposed to be haunted, as an old German\nknight had hanged himself there. His portrait was on the glass (stained\nwindow) ; I had always laughed at it, his legs seemed so [much] out of joint.\nMy cousin and I slept together, and we went to bed rather late one night,\nand some one had laughed and said :\n'\nThe ten years are up (the ghost only\n\f136 Journal of Societij for Psychical Reisearcli.. [Oct., 1893.\ncame once in ten years), you'll sec the ghost to-night.' Well, we hadn't\nbeen in bed over half an hour or so when a strange light appeared, and then\nemerged, aijjjarently out of the wall (or stained window, perhaps), a\nghastly figure with green glistening eyes\u2014at least my cousin said they were\ngreen ; I am not sure what colour they were, but, at any rate, they glistened.\nI screamed, the figure walked towards my cousin's bed, and seemed to want\nto say something. My cousin, however, didn't give the thing a chance, she\ncourageously seized it, but it pulled the draperies away as if by some\nunseen hand, and the whole thing sank, apparently, into the floor. The\ndress of the ghost was of a soft and diaphanous substance. We might have\nthought that it was one of the girls playing a trick, excepting that the door was\nfast shut all the time, there were no cupboards in the room, and at the first\nscream they (the girls) both rushed in. B. fancied she saw something white\nsink into the floor as they came in. We hunted under the beds and every-\nwhere, but not a trace of it was to be found all night, though we heard\nmoans and groans. This is a true account of our ghost adventure. One\nthing I know, I won't go and sleep in the room nine years hence for a\ngood deal.\n\"L. V.\"\nIt will be observed from the reference to \"nine years hence\" in the\nlast sentence, that the above account cannot have been written, as Miss\nMcCa.skill supposed, immediately after the event, though Miss V. may\nhave referred in writing it to the account which Miss McCa.skill thinks\nshe wrote on the following day.\nThe plan of tlie room, enclosed, shows two windows opposite to the\ndoor, and the two beds occupying practically the whole wall between the\ndoor and the windows. The stained window was the one next to this wall.\nMiss Johnson writes :\n\u2014\n\"February 23rd, 1893.\n\"Miss McCaskill gave me to-day the following account of her experience\nat Cassel.\n\"She had gone there to visit her cousin. Miss V., who had been\nstaying there some time and knew tlie story of the haunt. Miss McCaskill\nhad only been there for a few days at the time, and also had heard of the\nroom being supposed to be haunted, but neither of them thought anything\nof it, or was at all nervous. On this particular evening\u2014in August, 1891\u2014\nthey had gone to bed late and had afterwards had a great deal of talk, especi-\nally about the opera they were to go to the next day. Almost immediately\nafter they had left off talking Miss McCaskill, who was lying with her face to\nthe wall, was startled by a scream by Miss V., who shrieked out, 'There is\nsomething in the room,' or words to that effect. Miss McCaskill turned round\nand saw a very tall figure\u2014 taller than that of a woman\u2014and completely draped\nin white. The white drapery covered the whole of the face, leaving only the\neyes exposed, which were green and glistening. The figure was clearly defined,\nbut both of them noticed that it was transparent\u2014 the wall-paper, &c.,\nshowing through it. It seemed to come from the direction of the stained window\nand moved along by the side of Miss V.'s bed. Then it came up to Miss\nMcCaskill's bed and bent down over her. She seized its drapery, which felt\nsoft and gauzy. This seemed to slip through her hands, and the figure\n\fOct., 189S.] Journal of Society for Psychical EescarcL\nsuddenly disappeared. The room was brilliantly lighted by tlie moonlight\nwhich came through the plain window. This had no curtains, and only a\nsmall muslin (?) blind over tlio lower part of it. In fact, the room was so\nlight that Miss McCaskill or her cousin had remarked when the candles were\nput out that it was unnecessary to have had them at all\u2014they could have\nseen just as well without them. The room was small and bare, with no\nhangings behind which anything could have Ijeen concealed. The door was\nshut\u2014it always made a great noise in opening or shutting, so that they must\nhave heard if anyone had come in.\n\"After the figure disappeared some other members of the household\ncame at once. The room was searched thoroughly\u2014there was not space\nenough under the beds for anyone to have got there, and Miss McCaskill did\nnot think that anyone could have escaped through the door when it was\nopened by the others coming in, without being seen, as the room was so light.\nAlso, she was certain that she liad actually seen the figure disappear about an\narm's length from her bed before they had come in. Miss McCaskill was\nnot frightened at the time, but it gave a great shock to Miss V.\"\nMiss Johnson sent these notes to Miss McCaskill for confirmation, and\nmade a few more inquiries as to some details. Miss McCaskill replied :\n\u2014\n\"As to the door, the handle was close to my bed, so near that I could\neasily open it sitting up in bed (and have, in fact, done so). Hence the\nimpossibility of its being opened or shut unknown to me. Moreover, it was\na particularly noisy arrangement. L.'s head was close to the window\u2014thus\nher feet touched the head of my bed, nothing but the iron of the two bed-\nsteads separating us. Thus I faced the door.\n\"The transparency is quite correctly described. L. and I both noticed it\nindependently. I think it was that more than anything else which made me\nfeel we had to do with something unearthly.\n\"I did not know that there was any story about the room\u2014my cousin\ndid, and liad asked me casually some days before whether I believed in\nghosts, to which I replied that I didn't know, but that I myself had never seen\nanything. We did not call out for help : it was L.'s first and only scream of\nfright which brought her mother. No one else knew anything about it.\nG. von T. came to the door some minutes later to know what was the\nmatter, and we said L. wasn't well. To this day no other member of the house-\nhold but Miss Y. 's mother knows anything about it. The 'thing' disappeared\nnearer my bed than the middle of the room, about an arm's length, in fact.\nI really was too frightened by my cousin's fright to be more than utterly\nastonished at the apparition, but I did not enjoy the time after we were\nsettled down agahi. We never saw anything before or since in the room.\"\nG. 240. Collective Appai'ition.\nFrom the Rev. H. R. Harrison.\n\"Balne Vicarage, Snaith R.S.O., Yorkshire.\n\" ilfarc7(.

When walking towards\nthe churchyard you suddenly said to me, 'Who's that?' The same object\nthat attracted your attention had attracted mine before you spoke. There\nwe saw before us, walking, or perhaps it would bo more correct to say\n(jlidmg, at a fair pace, a figure (apparently that of a woman) making its way\nacross the churchyard. The figure was of a ghostly appearance and of good\nheight, which, having passed by, suddenly vanished\u2014at a spot I believe I\ncould go straight to now. Suspecting that it might be some living person,\nwe hastened to examine the place, but found no traces of any human being\nin fact, had it been one, he or she must have got over the brick wall that\ndivides the churchyard from the field ; and had this been done we must have\nseen it.\n\" D. WiLKiE Peregrine.\nProfessor Sidgwick writes :\n\" March 18th, 1892.\n\" I have just been in the garden and the churchyard with Mr. Harrison.\nHis recollection is that it was ciuite light enough to see the figure clearly,\nthough it was 10 p.m. When they saw it they had no idea that it Avas\nanything ghostly ;\nthey entertained no doubt that it was a real woman, but\nwere surprised to see her not on the path but walking among the graves.\nThey at once ran, one to the gate into the churchyard from the garden, the\nother, jumping over a low wall, into the churchyard by another gate ;\nthen\nthey found the woman gone, and for the first time began to think it queer.\nThe place where they saw the woman was only about half a dozen yards off ;\nthe distance they had to run not more than eighty paces divided between the\ntwo, so that they 'hardly took their eyes off her,' and cannot conceive how a\nreal woman should have got away in the time.

As far as communications embodying\nmatter not hitherto published were concerned, one of the most impor-\ntant of those made to the Congress was the report by Judge Dailey ot\nclairvoyant and telepathic phenomena observed m the case of the\nhysterical patient. Miss Mollie Fancher.\nMr Myers said that while in America, he had also had sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper, who had previously, owing to ill-health, been obliged\nto -ive up receiving sitters for a time. Since her health became\nre-established, her trance-utterances have on the whole much improved\nin evidential value, the tests given being generally more complete and\nsatisfactory. She has developed a new control, a young man well\nknown in Boston and recently dead, who by the tests given as to\nhis past life and apparent knowledge of circumstances occurring m his\nfamily since, has convinced his nearest relations of his identity. For\ninstance, his father's actions during two or three consecutive days\nwere reported contemporaneously through Mrs. Piper, one incident\n\fNov,, 1893,] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 143\nbeing the accidental breaking of a negative of the son's photograph,\nand the father's visit to the photographer to replace it. Sonae of\nMrs. Piper's utterances were now given through automatic writing.\nMb. Walter Leaf read a paper, consisting of translations from the\nRussian of letters written by Madame Blavatsky in 1874 and 1875 to\nMr. Aksakoff. These letters show that at the beginning of 1874\nMadame Blavatsky, who was then in New York, was an avowed and\nardent Spiritualist. Under the difficulties which overwhelmed Spirit-\nualism in America through the \"Katie King \" exposures, they show\nhow she and Colonel Olcott were led into starting a Spii'itualist schism,\nwhich produced first the \" Miracle Club,\" and then by a gradual process\nof development the Theosophical Society. They further show how, at\na time when Madame Blavatsky, according to the later legend, was and\nhad for a long time been under the guidance of her masters,\" [the\nMahatmas of Tliibet, she represented lierself as being advised and\ncomforted by her \"only friend in the world,\" the \"pure spirit,\" John\nKing. The earlier steps of the gradual process by which he was\ndeveloped into \"Mahatma M.\" were also clearly indicated. The letters\nalso contain remarkable admissions as to Madame Blavatsky's earlier\nlife.\nMe. Mead, the Secretary of the Theosophical Society, said that as\na persona] friend of Madame Blavatsky's, he was in some respects in a\nbetter position for Judging of tlie letters \\\\ hich had just been read than\nMr. Leaf. Mr. Leaf, for instance, did not seem to realise that Madame\nBlavatsky was very fond of humour. It was true tliat for some time\nshe had worked with and for Spiritualists, as she once thought that she\nwould find among them the people she wanted to carry out her ideas. It\nhad been stated that \"the Masters\" were an after-thought on her part,\nbut her own other writings must be considered of equal authority to\nany inferences to be drawn from her letters, and there is a sentence in\nher diai-y of August, 1851, to the effect that \"it was the first time she\nhad met the Master of her dreams.\" As to the early history of Madame\nBlavatsky, no one really knows what this was. The condemnations of\nher were founded merely on inferences from her own words, and it was\nher high idea of honour which made her condemn herself for small\nthings. Mr. Mead concluded l^y an indignant protest against Mr.\nLeaf's treatment of the whole subject, asking what would be thought of\nthe Theosophical Society if it brought similar charges against the private\ncharacter of individual members of the Society for Psychical Research.\nMr. Page Hopps maintained that the extracts Mr. Leaf had given\nproved nothing in particular, except that Madame Blavatsky was once\nan ardent but very independent and rather egotistical Spiritualist, and\nthat she drifted about as strong moods led. Her vague self-reproaches\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Resectrcli. [Nov. 1893.\nwent for very little, and those that had been quoted gave us no\nmaterial for forming a judgment, even if we had any right to judge.\nMr. F. W. Hayes observed that nothing had been said as to why\nthis information had been so long withheld from the public, and asked\nwhy it had not been pubhshed before Madame Blavatsky's death,\nMr. Leaf replied that in February, 1886, the letters he referred to\nhad been brought before the Paris branch of the Theosophical Society\nand had led to its dissolution.\nMe. Peaesall Smith remarked, witli reference to Mr. Mead's\ncomments, that in the case, for instance, of Mormonism, there had\nbeen much point in inquiring into the personal character of its\nfounders.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers pointed out in reply to Mr. Mead that the\ninquiry into Madame Blavatsky's personal character, and into the tenets\nwhich she had at given dates professed, bore directly upon the genuine-\nness of the transcendental phenomena which she claimed to exhibit,\nand upon the veracity of the statements as to communication with\nhigher intelligences which she used those phenomena to support.\nMadame Blavatsky stood, in this respect, on an entirely different\nfooting from that occupied by ordinary students, who made no claim to\ntranscendental powers of their own. The exceptional claim involved\nexceptional scrutiny. He was now about to read a paper on Mr.\nStainton Moses' phenomena ; and although Mr. Moses had been for\nmany years a friend of his own, and he (the speaker) had no personal\ndoubt of Mr. Moses' probity, it would be seen that he had thought it\nright to analyse Mr. Moses' character and career in detail, so as to give\nall the material in his power for an independent judgment on his\nhearers' part as to whether Mr. Moses was to be trusted or no.\nMr. Myers then began a paper on \" The Experiences of W. Stainton\nMoses,\"and described in detail the printed, manuscript, and oral evidence\nto which he had had access. This included the concurrent, concordant,\nand contemporary testimony of Mr. Moses himself. Dr. Speer, Mrs.\nSpeer, and, for many of the incidents, of Mr. F, W. Percival. The\ntestimony of Mr. Charlton Speer would, he hoped, be added at the next\nmeeting. The time now available did not suffice for more than a brief\nenumeration of the leading classes of transcendental physical phe-\nnomena with which that evidence would deal in detail.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nWe give below two cases of apparitions seen collectively, which\npresent some features of special interest. In the first, different but\ncorresponding aspects of the figure are seen by the two percipients \u2014\n\fNov., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 145\nin much the same way that a real person might be seen by two\npersons\u2014one seeing a profile and the other a back view and at the\nsame time a reflection of the face of the apparition in the mirror in\nfront of it.\nIn the second case, the apparition also presents different aspects\nto the two percipients, who are some distance apart, but there is a\nmarked lack of correspondence between the aspects. One percipient\nsees a figure facing her in one place. Immediately after she loses sight\nof it, the other, some way behind her, sees the back of a similar figure\nin another place.\nBoth the cases are comparatively recent, and seem to have been\ncarefully observed and reported.\nG. '241. Collective Apparition.\nMr. Barkworth writes :\n\u2014\nThe following statements were kindly furnished me by thi'ee ladies\nwho do not wish their names to appear, and whom I will designate as\nLady B., Miss B., her daughter, and Miss D. B., her niece. The\nhouse where the occurrences took place is situated in a London square\nin which there is but little noise of any kind. There is only a gas\nlamp opposite the house, and the windows are provided with blinds of\nsome thick stufi' material, so that it seems difficult to understand how\nthe figure Avas seen so clearly, unless it was to some extent self-\nluminous. The percipients all appeared to have retained very clear\nrecollections of the circumstances testified to, and I should regard\nthem as what are called good witnesses in every way. I did not see\nthe maid-servant, as it was explained to me that it was thought\nundesirable to encourage any notice of the matter being taken among\nthe domestics. J took down the ladies' evidence from word of mouth\nas below.\nStatement of Lady B.\nThe family had lived in the house about 25 years. Several years ago,\nwhen sleeping in the spare room, had heard footsteps as of a person passing\nthe door, who tried the handle and then mounted to the floor above. The\ndoor in question was situated just at the top of the principal staircase, which\nis of stone, and, as would have been the case with any ordinary person, the\nsteps were inaudible till they were on the boarded floor at the top. After\ntrying the door, the w^ocden staircase to the next floor was heard to creak,\nacconiipanied by a peculiar sound of stumbling, as though the person had\ncaught her foot in lier dress. At first Lady B. attributed the sounds to some\nliving person. She, Iiowever, mentioned them to her sister, who said she\nhad often heard them. Afterwards she looked out of her door wdien the\nsounds were heard, but saw nothing. The maids denied having been out of\ntheir roojiis, though questioned several times. The walking upstairs and\n\f146 Joufnat of Society for Psjjchical Research. [Nov., 1893.\nother noises were heard frequently, but sometimes with intervals of months.\nNo importance was attached to them till after the visual experience. This\noccurred about a year and a half ago. Lady B. was sleeping in her own\nroom, which is next the spare room, and Miss B. was sleeping in another\nbed at her side. In the middle of the night both ladies suddenly started up\nwide awake without any apparent cause, and saw a figure in a white garment,\nwhich might have been a nightdress, with dark curly hair. The room was\nnot quite dark, although there was no artificial light except from the gas\nlamp in the square. No fear nor any physical sensation was experienced.\nThe figure was standing hi front of the fireplace, over which was a mirror.\nThe position was such as to show the face in quarter profile and to intercept\nits own reflection from the mirror. It was a female figure, with hair down the\nback. The face, so far as shown, was clearly visible. The two ladies both\nspoke and sprang out of bed to the doors, which they found locked. On\nturning round again, the figure had disappeared.\nThe maid-servant is said to have seen a figure in daylight in the same\nposition but in a black costume. She took it for a burglar.\nNothing since has been noticed except noises.\nStatement of Miss B.\n(3n returning home after leaving school, heard the footsteps night after\nnight, and they were often repeated in the same night. The door handle\nwould be turned and the footsteps pass upstairs. Miss B. had no fear of\nghosts whatever. Her brothers have occasionally sat up at night to watch,\nbut nothing occurred at those times. Only saw the apparition once, when\nwith Lady B., as described by her. Saw the back of the figure and its long\ndark hair, but not the face. The face was, however, clearly reflected in the\nmirror, and Miss B. saw it there distinctly. Like Lady B., she woke up\nsuddenly, without assignable cause. The room seemed lighted up.\nLady B. and Miss B. add :\nThe accompanying statements correctly represent the information given\nbv us to Mr. Barkworth. (Signed) S. B.\n. A. D. B.\nStatement op Misy D. B.\nWhen sleeping in the spare room some years ago, I heard the footsteps\non the stairs, and the door handle shaken. It was about one o'clock a.m ,\nand the houseliold were all in bed. This happened twice, and I then learnt\nfor the first time that other people sleeping in this room had complained of\nthe same thing. (Signed) D. F.B.\nG. 242. Collective Apparition.\nFrom Miss M. W. Scott.\nFor the followinp; account we are indebted to Miss E. E. Guthrie\nof 4, Bask Place, Onne-squave, London, W. It was encloeed in a\nletter dated February 20th, 1893.\nMiss Scott writes :\nThe incident I am about to relate occurred on the 7th of May, 1892,\n\fNov., 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nbetween iive and six in the afternoon. Having gone for a walk, I was\nreturning homewards by a road in tlie vicinity of St. Boswells. The greater\nportion of the way is quite level, but at one part a short incline terminates\nwith a sharp corner at the end. From the top of this eminence the whole\nroad is conspicuous, with a hedge and bank on either aide. Upon reaching\nthe specified point, and finding time limited, I thought I would expedite\nmatters by running, and had not gone many steps when I came to a sudden\nhalt, for just a few yards beyond I perceived a tall mar. dressed in black, and\nwho walked along at a moderate pace. Fancying he would think mine an\nextraordinary proceeding, I finally stopped altogether to permit of his getting\non further, while at the same time watching him turn the corner and pass\non where his figure was still distinctly defined between the hedges referred\nto. He was gone in a second\u2014there being no exit anywhere\u2014without my\nhaving become aware of it. Greatly surprised, I then myself passed the\nsame corner and spot where I had seen the man vanish a few seconds before,\nand here, a short space onward, I saw one of my sisters standing and looknig\nabout everywhere in a bewildered manner. When I came up to her I said ;\n\"Wherever has that man disappeared to ?\n\" and upon our comparing notes\ntogether it became evident that we had both experienced a similar sensa-\ntion regarding the stranger, the only difference being that I had seen\nthe apparition on in front, while she says he came facing her, and she, too,\nhad noticed he vanished almost immediately.\nBut here the strangest part of it all is that we found that when the man\nbecame intidble to her, ho appeared to me between the part of the road v:here she\nand I u-ere standing. I may a'so here add that at the time we saw the\napparition neither sister knew the other was so near.\nOur experience then ended, until some weeks later, for though we\nthought the encounter a strange one, we did not trouble much about it.\nTowards the end of July, and at the same hour as before, another sister and\nmyself were traversing the same spot, when not far distant I observed a dark\nfigure approaching, and exclaimed :\n\" Oh, I do believe that is our man. T\nwon't remove my eyes from him !\n\" and neither we did till he seemed to\nfade away towards the bank on our right. Not waiting a moment to consider,\neach rushed frantically to either side of the road, but, of course, saw nothing.\nWe questioned some boys who were on the top of a hay-cart in the opposite\nfield, and to whom the expanse of road was clearly visible, but they declared\nno one had passed that way. This time I again viewed the entire figure,\nwhile my sister only saw the head and to below the shoulders. The man\nwas dressed entirely in black, consisting of a long coat, gaiters, and knee-\nbreeches, and his legs were very thin. Round his throat was a wide white\ncravat, such as I have seen in old pictures. On his head was a low-crowned\nhat\u2014the fashion I am unable to describe. His face, of which I only saw the\nprofile, was exceedingly thin and deadly pale.\nNearly eight months have elapsed since these incidents, but the figure has\nnot appeared to us again, though we frequently have occasion to pass that\nway, both by daylight and darkness, so in conclusion I must just relate two\nexperiences of others at about the same period as we had our visitations.\nTwo girls going from the village were attracted near the haunted walk by\n\f14<8 JouTrad of Society for Psychical Research.

They stopped to gather them,\nand while thus employed they heard a thud or thump upon the ground beside\nthem, but seeing no one they again continued their occupation. The sound\nwas relocated. Looking uj), they then saw a tall man gazing intently, and they,\nbeing almost paralysed with fright at the awful expression of his countenance,\nclutched one another convulsively and fled jDrecipitately, but after a time,\nventuring to look back, they saw the figure still standing, and while they\nlooked lie (jrudnally faded aivay. These girls affirm that the man was dressed\nexactly as I have before described, that his face was white as death, and a\nwhite fihny sheet or vapour now enveloped his raiment.\nIt is [reported] that the same apparition appeared about two years ago\nto some boys, and, coming up close beside them, instantly melted into space.\nAlso for nearly a fortnight blue lights were seen after dark near the spot\nfrequented by the ghost ; these were not stationary, but moved about in\nvaried directions. Many people followed them, but all attempts to solve\nthe mystery have proved fruitless. No cause can be suggested for the strange\nproceedings, though legend hath it that a child was murdered close by, but\nthis fact is quite beyond the recollection of the oldest inhabitant of the\nneighbourhood. The apparition has been visible to many, and few care to\ntravei'se his haunts after dark.\nMiss Gruthrie, in sending us the account, enclosed a plan of the\nlocality (i-eproduced below), saying :\nI spent a day at Lessudden last autunui, and can vouch for the truth-\nfulness of the story as regards locality, for so thick is the beech hedge and so\nopen the fields that no man could jjonetrate the one or conceal himself in\nthe other.\nCX\nBx\nA\nX\nA and B. \u2014Where apparition was sesn by the Misses Scott.\nC.\u2014Where it was seen by the children gathering wild strawberries,\nD, E. \u2014Green lane where the child is said to have been murdered.\nEvidence op Miss Louisa Scott.\nAs my sister has written a full and accurate account of our extra-\nordinary exjjerienoe in seeing a ghost in the broad daylight of a May after-\nnoon, and as the road has already been described, I need only describe very\nbriefly the appearance and movements of the apparition as I saw him. The\ndate was the 7th of May, 1892, hour about a quarter before six, when, as I\nwas walking homewards, I saw advancing towards me at an ordiilary pace a\n\u2022E,\n\fNov., 1893.] Journal of Society for PsycKical Research.\ntall man, dressed in black, Avliom I believed to be a clergyman. I removed\nmy gaze but for a second, when great was my surprise when lookmg\nup again to find that he had gone from my sight. The hedge on eitlier\nside of the road is very thick, with wide fields on either side, so that\nthe man could not possibly have sprung over it without my having seen\nhim. I felt extremely mystified, and stood for several minutes, looking\nbackwards and forwards into the fields and in all directions, when I was\nmuch surprised by seeing my sister turn the corner of a little\nincline higher up the road and commence running down it, almost\nimmediately coming to a sudden halt, and I saw her acting in the same\nway as I had done about five minutes before. Soon she walked onwards\nagain, and finally turned the second sharp angle of the road and came\nhurriedly towards me, looking very much excited. (I had no idea that she\nwas behind, nor did she know that I should be likely to be found in front of\nher.) Upon coming up to me she said, \"Where on earth is that man who\nvras standing only about ten feet from you ?\n\" And here, what makes it still\nmore striking is that I was facing the tall spectre, yet could not see\nhim when my aister did. She was more fortunate than I, for she saw the\nentire dress of the man, while I only noticed his long black coat, the lower\npart of his body to me being invisible ; while she had the satisfaction of\nseeing him entirely and also seeing him vanish, as she did not remove her\neyes, as 1 did, from the first time of seeing him. This is all I have seen of\nthe man, but to what I did see nothing has been added by the aid of\nimagination.\n(Signed) Louisa Scott.\nMiss M. W. Scott adds\nLessudden House, St. Boswells, N.B.\nMy other sister, who was with me when we saw the apparition for the\nlast time, says that in the sketch I sent through Miss Guthrie it is narrated\nwhat she saw, and therefore she thinks her statement would be scarcely\nworth anything, her experience being so slight, as she only noticed the head\nand shoulders of the man, while I, as before, on the other occasion, perceived\nthe entire dark figure.\nWe heard from Miss Scott a few mouths later that she had again\nseen the apparition in the same place as before. She describes it as\nfollows\nLessudden House, St. Boswells, Roxburghshire.\nJune Uth, 1898.\nI have again seen the ghost, and under the following circumstances.\nOn Sunday last, June 12th, at a few minutes before ten in the morning,\nhavmg occasion to pass that way, I perceived far in front a dark figure, who\nat that distance was indistinguishable as to whether it were man or woman,\nbut believing the person to be the latter, and one I was acquainted with and\nlikely to meet at that hour, I determined to hurry on and overtake her. I had\nnot gone far, however, when I soon discovered it to be none other than the\napparition we had looked for and failed to see for so many months. I did\nnot then feel at all afraid, and, hoping to get a nearer inspection, boldly\nfollowed, runnhig in close pursuit ; but here the strangest part of it all is\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1803.\nthat, though lie was apparently walking slowly, I never could get any closer\nthan within a few yards, for in but a moment he seemed to float or skim\naway. Presently he suddenly came to a standstill, and I began to feel very\nmuch afraid, and stopped also. There he was !\u2014the tall spectre dressed\nas I have described before. He turned round and gazed at me with a\nvacant expression, and the same ghastly, pallid features. I can liken him to\nno one I have ever seen. While I stood, he still looked intently at me for a\nfew seconds, then resumed his former position. Moving on a few steps he\nagain stood and looked back for the second tinre, finally \/atW)i;\/\/ro)f), view at\nhis usual spot by the hedge to the right.\nThere was no one else on the road but myself, and here I solemnly state\nthat what I have written is not at all traded upon by imagination, as I was not\nthinking of the apparition at the time, he not having been seen for months\nprevious to this visitation. With this strange experience I now felt really\nterribly frightened, so nmch so that I beat a hasty retreat homewards,\nwhen further on I met a woman coming along who knew of the bad reputa-\ntion of the road, and to her I related my adventure. She, too, was territied,\nand declared she would go no further alone, so at last I agreed to accompany\nher onwards to see if we could perceive anything more of the man. We, how-\never, reached our destination in safety, witliout the ghost becoming visible.\nAll I can say in conclusion is that I will never voluntarily pass along the\nsame place alone. The girls who saw the man last summer when gathering\nwild strawberries, have failed to give me their statements in writing, though\nI have long waited for them. Perhaps the reason is that being so young\nthey may feel themselves unable to commit their experiences to paper. I\nam assured, however, that the description I gave of their sensations in my\nsketch to Miss Guthrie is absolutely correct in every detail.\nIn a letter of June 28th, 1893, to Miss Guthrie, Miss Scott adds :\u2014\nI have had a splendid inspection of his appearance this time. He wears\nwhat is likely to Ije black silk stockings and shoe-buckles, short knee-\nbreeches, and long black coat. The hat I cannot describe. The man is cer-\ntainly dressed as a clergyman of the last century, and we have an old picture\nin the house for which he might have sat.\nAs to the costume in which the apparition was seen, Miss Guthrie\nsays :\u2014\nThe dress worn, as regards the knee-breeches and silk stockings, 1 can\nvouch for as having been formerly a part of clerical attire, as my aunt had\nan engraving of Dr. Pankine, minister of St. David's Parish, Glasgow, m\nwhich he wears these and, I think, buckles in his shoes. The Moderator o\nthe Scottish Church also wears this dress.\nP.

[Nov., i893.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFICACY OP CHARMS.\nMr. Myers has received the following from a correspondent :\u2014\nThe Arts CUib, Manchester.\nSeptember 2Mh, 1893.\nDeak Sir, \u2014 ... I have been experimenting with something new ;\nyet it is something very old. Having obtained a sufficient amount of\nevidence to make me think the subject worthy of wider experiment, I\nnow bring it under your notice.\nThe uncivilised Africans, among whom I have spent many years (16),\nmake large use of charms, worn on the person, in cases of illness. Mission-\naries and traders are at one that they occasionally derive great benefit from\nthis \"superstition,\" and, probably as the most handy explanation, account\nfor the efficacy by the faith the wearers place in them. For myself, I think\nthe efficacy of these charms, for whatever reason, is comparable with the\nefficacy of allopathic drugs in the civilised world.\nI was curious to know whether any evidence could be obtained pointing\nto a probable cause for their eff'ect.\nIn order to do this, I imitated the African, but did my best to exclude\nthe factor of faith. I prepared a \"charm,\" consisting of a few hieroglyphics\nwritten on paper. This was wrapped up and sewn into a piece of tape, and\ntied firmly on the bare arm of the subject of the experiment. It was to be\nworn night and day for a few days, no time limit being given. I gave the\nsubjects to understand that I was only asking them to assist in an experi-\nment ;\nthat the charm was only paper with writing on it ; that they were\nnot to expect any improvement, but simply to tell me if such happened. If\nany faith element remained, it was against my wish, and must be a quantity\nresisting all methods of expulsion, even in people of education. Now for\nthe results in detail :\n(1) Myself, age 40. I have, all my life, been subject\nto some nervous trick or twitching of a muscle ; sometimes of the face, the\nhead, the shoulder, &c. This took the form of a peculiar snort from time to\ntime, and I was aware that it must be unpleasant. I therefore tried earnestly\nto suppress it, but without eff'ect. I wore a charm, and it immediately\ndisappeared. Some few days after I found myself at it again, and found\nthat the charm had slipped from ivliere I could feel it to the elbow. On\nreplacing it the annoyance ceased. The same lapse occuired two or three\ntimes, but I always found the charm had slipped. After a few weeks I\ndiscontinued its use, and the bad habit has not recommenced.\nAnother case lately <wcurring to mjself is the following : \u2014I have for the\nlast two months been very weak and ill \u2014slight valvular affection of the\nheart, on the occasion I mention accompanied by severe pain in the back\nand sides. I was visiting my sister, having a rest, but did not seem to\nimprove. One night she tied me a charm on the left arm, and I passed a\ngood night. The following morning a servant said \" Good morning \" to me,\nbut made no further remark. She went into the kitchen and said to the\ncook: \" I can't think what has hapijened to Mr. Phillips ; he looks quite\nwell this morning. 1 never saw such a change in anybody I\n\" And I felt\n\fNov., 1893,] Joiivnal of Society for Fsychioal Research, 153\nwell, tliougli weak. I had no pain whatever, and for the first time in many\nmonths was not conscious that I had a lieart. This freedom from pain has\nremained for about three weeks, up to the present time. I am hardly ever\nconscious of pain, but only of Aveakness, and I feel considerably better on\nthat score,\nThe next case is Miss G., cook at the establishment of which my\nsister is matron\u2014the \"Convalescent Home,\" S. Age, say, 50. The\nkitchen of the place is very hot\u201490 to 100 deg. F. every day. Miss G. is\nsadly overworked, being constantly on her feet in this temperature from\n8 a.m. to 8 p.m. What wonder that her health gave way and she became a\nmartyr to sick headache ! Scarcely ever a week passed but she had to\nremain in bed some portion of or all day. I gave her a charm some 9 or\n10 weeks ago, and am not aware that she has been laid up since. She has\ntold me, when visiting, that she has not been so, and that her headaches have\nbeen remarkably lessened, though, as she says, nothing will set her up so\nIon\" as she has to work all day hi that excessive temperature. She has\nactually given notice to leave, and intended to do so for a long time past.\nNext case : Mrs. M. ,\nage 50, complained that on trying to open her eyes\nin the ni^ht, or on awakening in the morning, she was obliged to push the\neyelids up with her fingers. She seemed to lack the power of opening them.\nA charm acted \"like a charm,\" and the annoyance ceased.\nMiss B. M., age say 25, complained of chronic cold in the head, remain-\nin persistently for several months. I gave her a charm, and four days\nafterwards she told me the cold had quite gone. She said, half ashamed to\nconfess her credulity, that she really thought the charm had cured her.\nL. H., 78, chronic sufferer from rheumatism. I gave him a charm, which\nhe, for convenience, wore loosely buttoned round his neck. No result. I\ntold him that he had disobeyed orders, and must wear it round his arm,\ntiglithj enoiifjh to feel it.\nI did not see him for some time, but he told me that, from whatever\ncause, he had been very free from pain, and had discontinued the charm.\nHe then had a fatiguing journey in Holland, and on his return told me he\nwas going to look for his charm, as he had had a recurrence of the pain. A\nweek or so after he told me he was wearing it ; had no pain ;\nnothing but\nweakness from old age to trouble him.\nM. H., age say 42, rheumatic ;\nis reported to me to be much the same,\nM.

He was recovering from last attack, and I gave him a charm,\nwhich he immediately lost. He continues to improve.\nThese are the details of all the experiments I have made, except one of\nwhich I have had no report. I find some diiliculty in persuading people to\nhelp me with my experiments. Some think them nonsensical, others\nuncanny. ... R. C. Phillips,\nCURING BY MENTAL SUGGESTION.\n(To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir, \u2014I venture to propose a new form of experiment, akin to that suggested\nin Mr. Hudson's book on curing physical ailments by suggestion while the\npatient is asleep. My plan is not quite the same as his, which consists in\nusing will force before going to sleep, and directing it towards the patient,\nto be used during the night. I have tried this, but did not find it success-\nful, partly, probably, because one is too tired at the end of the day to have much\nwill force available, but also, I imagine, because the patient is then likely to\nbe only slightly asleep. My patient and I sleep in adjoining rooms, and on\none occasion when I did this I was awakened when going into my first sleep\nby hearing her shout my name rather angrily through the wall in her sleep.\nWhat T have found, however, followed by real amendment, was when on two\noccasions I have tried the suggestion at 4 or 5 a.m., that is, after a night's\nrest for myself, while the patient was still in deep sleep. The ailment for\nwhich I tried suggestion was a long-standing attack of morbid hysterical\nperverseness, caused par(:ly by physical ill-health, partly by hereditary\ntendency. After the second \"treatment\" the perverseness passed off\nentirely, the child became \"herself,\" and the physical health having since\nbeen re-established, I hope it may be long before I have cause to make\nanother experiment But as it is certainly important that other experiments\nshould be made, could not other people try the same thing ? Especially\nwith regard to the question whether suggestion takes more effect when a\npatient first gees to sleep, or when he is in the deep sleep of the night or\nearly morning.\nI have not gone into the patient's room to make the suggestion, but have\ndone it from my own room ; and I have used every form of suggestion which\ncould strengthen my own efforts. \u2014Yours faithfully.\nAn Associate.\nOur correspondent, who is well-known to us, in a jjrivate letter\nexplains further her method of treatment, and the character of the\npatient referred to.

Last year I sent her to\nschool, and they did not attend to her health properly, the result of whicli\nwas that she was sent back to me at Easter as unmanageable, and the\n.symptoms lasted a month or six weeks after she returned.

Several times during this period 1 tried suggestion at bedtime, with\nslight alleviation of the symptoms next day ;\nbut twice I tried a long sugges-\ntion, half an hour or so, at four or five in the morning, and in both cases she\nwoke up a diflerent child in the morning. In the last case it was the end of\nthe worst time of her troubles. Since then she has only had ordinary fits of\nbad temper, which pass oft' with a night's rest, and usually before. I have\nhad a very large number of girls under my care, and never one at all like\nher. As a rule, as you say, one does not expect a fit of bad temper to last\nbeyond a day or two, and rarely that ; but these are quite diff'erent. It\nseems to me that if hypnotic sleep and other sleep are really much the same\nthing, one would naturally find a person most receptive in the deepest sleep\nof the night,\nCERTAIN CASES OF HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION.\n{To the Editor of the .Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir, -I am at a loss to understand how in certain cases of hypnotic sug-\ngestion' the hallucinatory image, when thrown upon a plain white screen of\nan even surface, appears enlarged or diminished if looked at through an\nopera-glass, according to which end is presented to the eye ;\nprecautions\nbeing taken to prevent the 2)ercipieut knowing wlur.h end is in use. {Animal\nMagnetism, Binet and F6rd, p. 229.)\nHow can the opera-glass afi\"ect what is only in the mind of the per-\ncipient \u2022]\nThe theory of the Nancy school, that everything can be explained\nas the result of suggestion from the hypnotiser, would not apply here, as the\nsubject could have no idea how the image was going to be modified, as no\nhints would be given him.\nWould this be a case where, to quote Mr. Myers' words, the \" knowledge\n[is] subliminally acquired by the subject, either by telepathic transmission\nfrom his hypnotiser, or by the exercise of independent clairvoyant faculty \" ?\n\u2014I am, yours sincerely, E.

Apart from\nthis, the witnesses had unfortunately no experience in observing and\ninterpreting the phenomena, and were ignorant of the precautions\nwhich it would now be thought necessary to take in carrying out such\nexperiments. Thus, in the case given of hypnotisation at a distance, it\ndoes not seem to have occurred to them to make sure that the subject\ndid not see the operator. Again, the degree of hypertesthesia which is\nknown to occur sometimes in the hypnotic condition would sufficiently\naccount for much that was put down to clairvoyance\u2014when, for\ninstance, the subject was supposed to discover which parts of a field\nhad been planted, and which had not, by \"seeing\" the seeds in tlie\nground, whereas there must clearly have been some indications of what\npart of the ground had been disturbed Nevertheless, there is strong\nevidence that, while in the hypnotic condition he general faculties of\nthe subject were heightened in a remarkable manner, and that he then\nshowed some powers of thought-transference and clairvoyance. The\ndegree to which he carried his power of self-hypnotisation is also\ninteresting, as it seems to show a transition towards the state of\nspontaneously alternating pe)'sonalities.\nThe first part of the account is a reprint of part of an article by\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec. 1893.\nMr. W, A. Cram, that appeared in the Banner of Light, August 29th,\n1891. Mr. Cram writes :\u2014\nIn the following account 1 shall endeavour to present to the reader a\nfew incidents, illustrative of a very remarkable phase of an individual life,\notherwise quite commonplace. I name them facts, because vouched for by\nhalf a dozen or more honest, discerning men, who witnessed them at\ndifferent times. The subject of these strange phenomena, which may,\nperhaps, generally be classed as \"hypnotic,\" was a young man about twenty\nyears old, poor and illiterate ; as a youth, of good health, mentally dull \u2014in\nsome directions bordering close upon stupidity ; he was no wise remarkable\nsave in that phase of his life scientifically considered \" hypnotic.\" At first,\nthe condition of the subject in which these strange manifestations of occult\npowers and senses appeared was induced by the word or hand movement of\na mesmeriser, or an operator ;\nlater, the subject himself could induce the\ncondition at will : in fact he at length became so susceptible, and found\nsuch delight in this remarkable state of exalted powers and senses, that he\nwould remain in it for whole days. The simplest manifestations of some\noccult power were certain feats of strength ; some object to be lifted would\nbe presented before him, requiring the force of three or four ordinary men\nto raise it from the ground. The subject in his natural condition would\nvainly attempt to move it, possessing less than average manly strength. The\nmoment he passed into the \" hypnotic \" condition, he would put his hands\nor arms carelessly upon or about the object, lifting it apparently with\nthe least effort ; sometimes it seemed to follow his hand, rather than be\nlifted.\nIn his marvellous powers of seeing, the phenomena were perhaps most\ninteresting. On the farm where he lived he would be assigned to the work\nof dropping corn, but first so completely blindfolded that by no possibility\ncould he see through our ordinary vision ; thus blindfolded, he would drop\nthe corn into the hills with careful exactness. It was soon discovered that\nhe did this work better in such a state than in his natural condition of\nseeing. To test his superior seeing still further, a number of hills here and\nthere throughout the corn-row would be dropped and carefully covered\nwithout his knowledge\u2014so as to appear as if not planted to all common\nsight. Set to drop the corn in such a row, he never failed to see the corn\nin the planted hills through an inch or two of soil covering, and so passed\nthem. He said he saw the corn all the same, whether uncovered or covered\nwith two inches of soil, and all the while perfectly blindfolded. Questioned\nhow he saw, he could not tell.\nAgain, while the subject of tliese peculiar phenomena was in one room,\nsome person in an adjoining, with no opening for seeing between the two\nrooms, would hold up a closed book in his hand ; the subject being asked to\nread on a certain page named\u2014no one present knowing what might be\nprinted on that particular page\u2014he would begin and slowly read ; on turning\nto the page designated, it would be found that he had read what was there\nprinted\u2014often in such experiments being also blindfolded, thus plainly\nseeing through thick folds of cloth, the wa,lls dividing the rooms, the cover\nand leaves of the closed book.\n\fDec, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 159\nThere were other manifestations of his superior vision similar to those\nrecorded by Swedenborg in his own experience. With a circle of neij^^h-\nbours about him in the evening, this subject, when in his \" hypnotic \" state,\nwould be asked to look over irto a neighbouring village some three miles oft',\ninto a certain house, and tell what he saw. He would immediately begin and\ndescribe objects in the room, dress and acts of the inmates\u2014sometimes\neven to very minute circumstances and details, at times laughing over\nsome amusing or strange thing he had discovered. It would be learned\nafterward on careful inquiry that he saw and gave accurate accounts of the\nroom, objects, people, Arc, at the specified time.\nHe finally grew into the habit of self-inducing this abnormal condition\nin leisure hours, and entertaining himself by looking miles away upon\npeople and objects all about, sometimes laughing immoderately, at other\ntimes seemingly afraid. Questioned as to what he was laughing at or afraid\nof, he would in a semi-imbecile way describe some funny or terrible thing\nhe saw over in a house, or mill, or wood, a mile or ten miles away.\nDr, Hodgson wrote to Mr. Cram to make further inquiries in the\ncase and received from him the following reply :\n\u2014\nHampton Falls, N.H., December 3rd, 1891.\nThe peculiar incidents presented in the Banner of Li'jU to which you\nrefer took place about 35 years ago. The young man, Ira Healey, the\nsubject, died about 10 years ago. I received the account of the facts from\nmy father, brother, and three or four neighbours, who agreed perfectly in\nstatement of the events. I stated in the paper only those facts vouched for\nby some half a dozen or more. Other incidents witnessed by my father or\nbrother alone I did not offer in the paper. One fact I now recall may\ninterest you. My brother told me that one day when he was at the\nmesmeriser's or operator's house\u2014who, by the way, was a common farmer,\nas much astonished as anyone at his own power over the subject, knowing\nlittle or nothing of mesmerism\u2014the talk turned on the question whether he,\nthe operator, could mesmerise Ira, the subject, at a distance of, say, half a\nmile, the subject knowing nothing of the intent. \" I have never tried, but\nI will when there is a chance,\" was the response of the operator. \" By the\nway, Ira has gone oft' on an errand ; he'll be back soon. Let's watch, and\nwhen he comes into the open space between the trees where we can see the\nroad about half a mile off, I'll try him.\" With a good deal of interest they\nwatched for the return of the subject. At length he appeared in the opening ;\nimmediately the operator willed him to \"sleep,\" and to stretch his\narm straight out before him. He was seen to pause a moment, then\nstretching his arm straight, walked on, so disappeared. In a few\nminutes he appeared coming down the lane to the house, in a pro-\nfound mesmeric sleep, his arm reaching straight before him. I re-\nceived this only from my brother. The operator was a man so noted\nfor honesty and truthfulness that his word was counted better than\noath or bond. One evening, quite a number of neighbours were\nassembled in a shoemaker's shop for country chat, Ira Healey, the\nsubject, sitting in one corner unnoticed, since he was counted rather\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1803.\nstupid and talked little. At this time he could self-induce the\n\"sleep,\" as he often did for his own delight. All at once he burst\ninto a hearty laugh, as if highly amused. This startled the company ;\nturning, they asked, \" Well, Ira, what is up now ?\n\" knowing that he was\nprobably on one of his \"sleep tramps.\" In his lialf-imbecile way, he\nreplied :\n\" Eben Tilton has got a new lot of pigs, and one of them hasn't got\na bit of a tail. They are all running around in his old barn.\" No one knew\nanything of the matter. \" Let's prove tliis,\" was the cry. Immediately two\nstarted, walked a mile, called the man out, told him the facts, said they\nwanted to look at his pigs. They went to the old barn, and found that one\nof the pigs had had his tail bitten off.\nThe subject amused himself evenings looking about over the country\ninto different houses. Many times the matter was tested, till it became a\nsettled fact of belief among the neighbours that Ira could see anywhere\nand through everything.\nI was about 12 years old at the time of these incidents, and recall\nvery little. I remember one day meeting him wandering about in the\nfields ; he had such a strange look and smile on his face he somewhat scared\nme. I recall that the people said at the time he had been three or four days\nin his sleep, and the operator couldn't get him out of it. He enjoyed the\nstate so much that he induced it more and more ;\nwould come in from the\nfield to rest a little while, would sit down and say, \" Now I'll sleep half an\nhour \"\n;\nimmediately dropped off into the mesmeric state, just his half an\nhour, then awakened by some occult timepiece, went into the field to work.\nIn his sleep he would smile, talk to himself, and appeared to have entered\nsome new world of super-sensible things a good deal more interesting than\nthis common-sense one of ours.\nThis may not interest you much. I write it just as it comes to mind. I\nhave been much interested in studying these matters the last 20 years.\nW. A. Cram.\nF.S.\u2014December Uh. I have just come from talking with the sister of the\noperator above mentioned. She lived in the house at the time of the\nmesmeric experiments. She says that the subject's eyes were always closed\nwhen in the \"sleep,\" and on examination the eyeballs were found turned up,\nso that little or nothing but \"the white\" was visible. When in this state\nhe used to read and look at pictures a great deal, talking and sometimes\nlaughing immoderately\u2014his eyes tiglitly closed, holding the book or paper\nclose to the upper part of his forehead.\nThis lady says that sometimes she would bo left alone with the subject,\nher brother away. The subject would go and sit in the operator's accustomed\nchair, saying, \"Now, I am going to sleep ten minutes.\" Passing into the\nstate, he would at times seem to be possessed with a dozen rollicking spirits,\nlaughing and talking and playing pranks ; would suddenly pause, get the\nBible and read awhile in the most sanctimonious manner ;\nalways waking up\nat the precise moment mentioned before entering the sleep, and knowing\nnoihinrj at all of what had passed while in his hypnotic or mesmeric\nsleep. She confirms what I mentioned above\u2014that the operator had no\npower to draw him out of his self-induced states. She adds that he often\n\fDec, 1893.] Juitmal of Society for Psychical Research. 161\nate at the table while in his mesmeric condition, but with eyes tightly\nclosed, yet plainly seeing as well or better than others.\njMr. Cram wrote to Dv. Hodgson later :\n\u2014\nHampton Falls, X.H., Januo.i'ij ith, 1892.\nI have to-day seen a man, Mr. Dean R. Tilton, who lived next-door\nneighbour to the operator and subject. I give the following\u2014some incidents\nin his experience of the matter\u2014as nearly as I can in his own words.\nMil. Tilton's Account.\n\" I went one day with the operator and subject to Exeter, to visit Com-\nmodore Long, who wanted to see Ira when mesmerised. Among many\nthings the Commodore had a big Chinese book full of pictures. It was given\nto Ira. He took it in his lap, dosed, did not open it, but commenced to\nlook through, admire and describe the pictures. We opened the book many\ntimes and found he had described them very accurately. The operator knew\nnothing of the book. The subject was blindfold all the time with two\nfolded handkerchiefs, one over each eye, and a third drawn around the head\nover the eyes to hold the folded ones in place.\n\"Mrs. Long came up to Ira, holding out her hand closed, back of hand\nup. She asked Ira what was in it. He said '\nwatch.' It was a small gold\nhunting-case one. She then asked him to tell the time through her hand.\nHe immediately put the side of his forehead to the back of her hand\u2014stated\nthe time. No one in the room knew the time it marked. On opening the\nwatch it was found he had named exactly the hour and minute.\n\" Ira Healey had very little control over horses. One day I was out in the\nfield at work. Rufiis (the operator) and Ira were at work alongside. Rufus\nwas sowing, Ira trying to harrow ; the horse was contrary ; Rufus was near\nme. We looked and saw Ira at the other end of the piece in great trouble ;\nhe had lost all control of the horse. Rufus immediately made two or three\n'passes' toward Ira, who was not looking toward us. At once Ira\nstraightened up as with the power of half a dozen horse trainers, subdued\nand drove the horse till the piece was finished, as if the horse had at once\nturned into the most docile old nag. In riding the horse to cultivate,\nsometimes the horse would get ugly and wouldn't mind Ira. rearing and\ntreading on the cornhills. Rufus would then make a '\npass ' of the hand\ntowards Ira, who was sitting on the horse, back to him ;\nimmediately he\ntook the horse into the most complete subjection.\n\" One day I was at work with Rufus and Ira. We were shovelling manure,\nRuEus wanted to send the cart and oxen up to the house, but Ira couldn't\nmanage the oxen. I suggested mesmerise him. Ira heard me, and wouldn't\nbe. I quietly turned and took the shovel Rufus had been using, then turning\nto Ira, said, 'You have my shovel,' passing to him Rufus' [shovel]. No\nS0(mer had Ira taken the shovel in hand that Rufus had been using than he\npassed into the 'sleep.' I handed him the 'ox goad,' and he started off\nhappy as a king, his eyes tightly closed, set the cart in place, managing the\nsteers as if the most skilled man in the world. In his natural state he could\nnot do it, yet his eyes were tightly shut always when mesmerised.\n\" One time I was at work with them. Rufus said, '\nCome, Ira, you plant\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1893.\ncam ;\nyou can do it easier and better mesmerised.' So he mesmerised liini.\nI said, '\nLet us blindfold him this time.' We blindfolded him with three\npocket-handkerchiefs. He started off to get corn from a bag at the end of\nthe field, went straight to the bag, took the corn out carefully, and began to\ndrop into the hill. Pretty soon he came to us, and said, 'The boy is\ndropping bad '\n\u2014a boy had been dropping some time un the piece\u2014' he puts\nin whole handfuls.' We followed him to the boy's row, he pointed to a\nplace, we saw nothing ; he dug down a little way and showed whole handfuls\ncovered u]). The boy had been given a stint to plant so much. Called to\naccount, the boy confessed he had put in whole handfuls sometimes and\ncovered it up, so as to get through his stint sooner.\n\" Planting his own row, Ira had glanced into the boy's row, next to him,\nand seen the covered-up corn.\"\n1 have given you just these little added facts from Mr. Tilton's experience.\nMr. Tilton is about sixty-five years old now, and totally blind, or I would\nhave asked him to have given the facts in his own handwriting. He sub-\nscribes his name to this, and my account in the Banner of Light, as being\ntrue. My brother died eight years ago. Miss Mary A. Sanborn and Mr.\nDean R. Tilton are the only direct witnesses I can find now.\nW. A. Cram.\nMr. Tilton signs the following statement :\nHampton Falls, N.H., Jawfcmj Uh, 1892.\nThe account of certain so-called mesmeric phenomena, witnessed through\nthe subject, Ira Healey, presented in the Banner of Light of August 29th,\n1891, is, according to my memory as a witness, a simple statement of facts.\nI have also told Mr. Cram certain facts not mentioned in said account, which\nhe proposes to present to you, which I will vouch for.\nMiss Sanborn, the sister of the operator, writes :\nHampton Falls, N.H., January Uh, 1892.\nThe account which Mr. W.

Sanborn.\nA CASE OF ALTERNATING PERSONALITY.\nThis case was reported by Prof. E. E. Slosson, of Wyoming\nUniversity, Laramie, Wyoming, to Prof. W. James. As is usual\nin such cases, there seems to have been an alternation of memory\nconcurrently with the changes of character in the two states. The\naccount was written in January, 1893, by Prof. Slosson's mother.\nC. F. H. was the illegitiuiate son of a yoUng man of good family and an\nIrish servant-girl. During the period covered by the recollection of the\ninformant (1847 to 1860) he was subject to marked changes of character,\naccompanied with partial loss of meilldry. In his normal state (primaiy\npersonality) he was conscientious, sober, industrious, and sedate ;\na man of\n\fDec, 1893.] Jom'nat of Society for Psychical Research. 16B\ngood sense, bub not brilliant ; a prominent menibei- of the church, leader in\nthe choir, and fond of reading. In his periods of secondary personality,\nwhich occurred at intervals of a few months and lasted a week or more, he\nwas witty, sharp, and unscrupulous ; was fond of going to dances and of sing-\ning low songs, and would not go to church ; sometimes he would sit silent\nand moody, or cry because he was poor. In this secondary state he was very\navaricious, and had a great desire for speculation. He was impatient, and\nwould become sullen or angry if crossed in any way. In this secondary state,\ntoo, he was a very close observer and a malicious critic ;\nquick to repeat any\nbit of scandal. In each state he only remembered what had happened in\nthe same state ; and on the change of personality he would not know in\nwhat work he had been engaged, or of the money he had earned since he\nhad been in the other state. On one occasion, 1847, when he was twenty years\nold, he was given a five-dollar bill to stop his crying, while in his second\ncondition. A few days later he resumed his primaiy personality, and knew\nnothing of it. The bill was searched for by all, but could not be found.\nMonths afterwards he awoke in his secondary personality, and when asked\nabout the bill went at once to a hole in a rag bag in a cellar and took it out.\nDuring his second condition he had a hallucination that his nose was\ncrooked, and would try to twist it back with his hand. His \" spells,\" as\nthey were called, were attributed by the local doctors to the formation of an\nabscess in his head. The secondary states increased gradually in length, and\nat the; same time the distinction between states became less marked. He\nmarried and had several children, some of whom are not of sound mind. He\nis atill living.\nThe above is the substance of my recollection. \u2014A. L. Slosson.\n[In a letter dated May 18th, 1893, Prof. E. E. Slosson writes :\u2014\nJ\n\" I have only one additional item in the case of C. H. That he\nwas cutting grass when he had one of his '\nspells,' and after a day's\nmowing awoke, '\nhimself,' the next morning. They tried to find the scythe\nto begin work with, but could not do so, and it remained lost until late in\nthe fall, when another '\nspell ' came on, and he started for the meadow and\ntook his scythe from a tree where he had hung it, but came back surprised\nto find that the ground was frozen and no grass there.\n\"E.

The accident had happened\n\u2014so Mrs. Bruce thinks\u2014precisely at 3.30, but she is not confident of the\nmoment. My own times I can fix; precisely.\nI had no reason to fear any accident, as my coachman had driven them\nwith the same horse frequently, and save a little freshness at starting, the\nhorse was always quiet on the road, even to sluggishness. A most unusual\noccurrence set it off. A telegraph operator, at the top of a telegraph post,\nhauled up a long flashing coil of wire under the horse's nose. Any horse in\nthe world, except the Troy horse, would have bolted under the circum-\nstances.\nMy wife's estimate of the precise time can only be taken as approximate.\nShe saw the time when she got home, and took that as her zero, but the\nconfusion and excitement of the walk home from the scene of the accident\nleaves room for doubt as to her power of settling the time accurately. The\naccident hajipened about 2j miles from home, and she was home by 4.10;\nbut she was some time on the ground waiting until the horse was dis-\nengaged, &c.\nW. CONYBBAHE BrUCE.\nArchdeacon Bruce adds later : \u2014\nMay 20th, 1893.\nI think I stated the fact that the impression of danger to Mrs. Bruce was\nonly momentary\u2014it passed at once\u2014and it was only when I heard of the\naccident that I recalled the impression. I did not therefore go home expect-\ning to find that anything had happened. W.

A\" P\" Apparition.\nFor the following account we are indebted to Lady Lyttelton, to\nwhom the percipient, Mr. L. S. M. Munro, first related it verbally.\nNovemher 29th, 1891.\nIt was on a Sunday in July or August last. I was seated in my rooms in\nLiverpool, which look out on a public thoroughfare, writing at a table which\nstands some six or eight feet from one of the windo.ws. I was engaged\nwriting on a subject in which I was much interested. I was alone. I had\ncome to a standstill in my writing, and searching for a continuation of\nthoughts, I believe my mind was for the moment a comparative blank.\nInstinctively I turned my head towards the window, and I saw looking in\nupon me through one of the panes the face of a young girl friend of mine,\nvivid and clear as if in life. She is, I think, about 10 or 11 years of age, and\nthe daughter of an acquaintance residing some 20 or 25 miles from my\nresidence, whom I have visited several times. The little girl and I became great\nfriends during my visits. I had not, however, thought of her or any of her\nconnections for weeks, probably for months, and certainly there was nothing\nfurther from my thoughts when I saw the vision than her or anything con-\nnected with her. The apparition aroused my mental activity, when it\nimmediately disappeared. The incident, however, made such an impression\non my mind that I at once took out my watch, noted the time\u2014 5.25\u2014and\nwithout any hesitation wrote to the little girl telling her of her mysterious\nvisit to me. By return of post came a letter from her and also one from her\nmother, stating that just about that time they had been having a conversa-\ntion about me, which was also unusual.\nI was then in my usual health, which is robust, and, except as before\nstated, in my normal mental condition. I have never had a similar experience.\nThe facts were as stated, but I have no reason to adduce for the myster^\nious occurrence. L. S. M. Muis'RO.\nWe asked Mr. Munro whether the letters referred to had been pre-\nserved, and also whether the window was in such a position that a real\nperson might have been looking into it, and he replied\n19, Princes-avenue, Liver^oool, May 25th, 1892.\nI have searched all my papers, but regret to find that the letters which I\nreceived at the time from the little girl and her mother must have been\ndestroyed, and I did not keep a copy of the letter which at the moment of\nthe occurrence I wrote to my little friend.\nSince the event took place my friends have gone to reside in Edinburgh,\nand I should not care to reopen the question with them in writing, as the\nmother, who is somewhat nervous and perhaps superstitious, was (as I \u2022\nlearned from mutual friends aftetwards) much distressed and agitated when\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1893.\nshe heard of the jipparitioii, regarding it as an evil omen. But if I should\nhave an opportunity of verbally inquiring if they have preserved my letter,\nI may communicate with you again.\nThe room in which I was sitting at the time is on the ground Hoor, but\nthe idea that I could have confused the figure with a real child outside the\nwindow is altogether precluded, as the window is situated in an enclosed\nspace ;\nand, moreover, I immediately went and satisfied myself that there\nwas no real person there. L. S. M. Munro.\nThe next two cases are instances of veridical impressions occurring\nduring severe illness, when it is conceivable that the abnormal con-\ndition of the percipients had some effect in heightening the percipient\nfaculty.\nG. 24.3. Apparition.\nThis case was sent by Mrs. C. Baker, having been obtained by her\nfrom her husband's niece, Miss Robinson, who writes :\n24, Trent-road, Brixton Hill, S.W., October 20th, 1893.\nIn December, 1880, I was twelve years old, and I was lying very\ndangerously ill with typhoid fever. The pain in my head was terrible, like\nan iron weight breaking my skull in ; but that was nothing to the mental\npain I was enduring, for my aunt I loved so much was ill. I knew she was\nsuffering great agony, and that there was little hope that anything could be\ndone to relieve her.\nThis aunt was the best friend we children ever had; the brightest,\nstrongest, most active woman I ever saw. She was ill. This is what haunted\nme day and night ; this is what caused me misery such as I have never known\nbefore or since, such as I trust I may never know in the same degree again.\nDuring my long, feverish niglits I used to count how many hours before\neight o'clock would come, for then the post came, and I might hear news. I\ndo not know how long this went on, it might be days or weeks ;\nbut one\nevening I suppose T had been asleep, for when I woke up I found the\nhospital nurse and my mother had left the room. But I was not alone, for\non the chair next my bed sat my father, who had been dead eight years. I\nwas not at all surprised, I was comforted by his presence. It did not enter\nmy mind to think he was dead or to speculate ; for he was there,' that was\nenough for me. He said :\n\" Do not trouble mother by always asking how\nAunt Mary is, for they have covered her with violets, so she has no more\npain.\" As the other people came in (I don't know who they were) my\nfather glided to the foot of my bed and went away, I do not know where or\nhow. I do not know if 1 had been in the dark, but there was a blue light\nround my father, but not on his face. I don't know what hie body looked\nlike, I never thought about it. He was my own dear father. I was quite\ncontent, and never doubted but that it was all right.\nMy trouble left me. I told my mother that I was not going to worry\nabout Aunt Mary, for papa had come and told me she was iiuite well, fot\nthey had covered her with violets. No one during the rest of my illness\nspoke of my aunt, and I never thought of her. Some weeks after I was well\n\fDku, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nagain, I was staying in the country with a kind aunt who had helped to\nnurse me. Un Sunday evening this aunt gently told nie Aunt Mary had\ndied the day before Christmas. My pain was long past ; it was no shock to\nme. That, then, was what father meant ; I had not thought of it till then.\nAfterwards they told me, when my aunt was dead, loving hands laid violets\nupon her. Violets were used upon her cothu. Violets are now growing upon\nher grave. Louise M. Robinson.\nMrs. Robinson writes :\n\u2014\n24, Trent-road, Brixton Hill, October Idth, 1893.\nDear Mrs. Bakeii,\u2014I enclose Louise's account of her strange experience\nin her illness. One\u2014if not the greatest\u2014trouble that I had was her continual\nanxiety and questions about her aunt ; and what was so wonderful was that,\nfrom the time she told me what she believed that her father had told her, she\nnever mentioned her aunt's name or made any inquiry about her. I cannot\nremember the time, I am sorry to say. I cannot tell if it was the day before\nor the day after her aunt s death that the circumstance occurred. I only\nknow that it was hefui-e I heard of my sider-m-lcvw's death. I only know the\nimmense relief it was to me that she ceased to trouble, as the doctors had\nsaid, if I told her in her state, the shock would kill her. Another strange\nthing was that on inquiry I found the coflin was covered with flowers\u2014\na\nmost surprising thing, as the family were extremely \" Low Church,\" and\nobjected to everything of the kind ; but her husband, knowing her love of\nflowers, carried out his own feeling in the matter.\nL. 963. Impression.\nThe second case comes to us through the American Branch of the\nSociety. A paragraph describing it appeared in the Religio-Phito-\nsophical Journal of July 26th, 1890, as follows :\n\u2014\nA despatch, dated .July 5th, to the St. Louis Globe-Democrat: Particu-\nlars as to the death by lightning of John King, a farmer near Warren-\ntown, Ala., have been received. While ploughing in a held a storm came\nup, and he hitched his team and took refuge under a tree. A flash of\nlightning killed the animals and their master, Mr. King's left side being\nbadly burned and left eye driven from the socket. His little girl, sick unto\ndeath, was lying in a comatose condition at home. As the flash lighted up\nthe room, she sprang up in bed and exclaimed, \" Oh, my papa is killed.\"\nDr. Hodgson obtained, some time later, corroboration of the case\nthrough the following letters from a gentleman living at \"Warrentown :\n\u2014\nWarrenton, Ala., May 26th, 1893.\nMy Deau Sir, \u2014I am in receipt of your communication of the 19th inst.,\nasking particulars of a casualty that occurred in this immediate vicinity\nseveral years ago\u2014the killing of John King by lightning.

[Dec ,\n1893.\nHe says that Mr. King had been ploughing about half a mile from his\ndwelling when the storm came up, and out of sight of his home, and as no\none witnessed it, the presumption is that he sought shelter under a few\nplanks that he had placed agahist a pine tree, and where his body was found.\nHe further states that his little daughter, who was sick in bed at the time,\nexclaimed excitedly that the lightning had killed her papa. He says every-\nthing is true as stated in the clipping, except the animals lieing killed. I\nlearn that King had a dog that followed him constantly. The dog returned\nto the family very soon after his master was killed, and l)y his actions and\nstrange nianner attracted the attention of Mrs. King, which together with\nthe exclamation of the child that its father had been killed, caused her to go\nat once in pursuit of her husband, whom she found dead and marked by\nliglitning as previously stated. It is clear that the little daughter had some\npremonition of the event before any report could have reached any member\nof the family confirming it.\n(Signed) H. W.

LDeq.. isoa.\nMr. Armstrong writes to Dr. Hodgson :\nLehmann's, La., March 20th, 1893,\nI will relate a dream that I had about two years ago, that in my opinion\nwas remarkable, although such dreams may be more common than we think,\nif they would always come to light. I was staying at the house of a young-\nfriend of mine, who at the time was infatuated with a young lady in the\nneighbourhood. His parents, as well as myself, were opposed to the\nalliance, and our conversation would often centre on the subject. One night\nI dreamed that he was determined to marry the girl. Everything was pre-\npared, and I remember hurrying off to the place where the ceremony was to\ntake place. I even forgot to put on my coat. I found him in a back room\nof the house, where I also saw his father, vainly trying to change his mind.\nI called my young friend to the side, and talked to him like a Dutch uncle,\ntrying to persuad\"e him out of the notion. Then I left the scene, and went\nhome^'in disgust. Now, we were sleeping in the same room and in the same\nbed, and after awaking in the morning, and before telling him of my\ndream, I asked what he had been dreaming about. He, half smilingly,\nanswered, \"Why, I dreamt that I was about to get married, when you came\nrushing in the house, in shirt -sleeves, and insisted that the ceremony must\nnot go\u00b0on.\" In fact, he related the experience just as I had seen it, coin-\nciding to a syllable with my dream.

J. Ch. Ptoux describes\nsuccessful experiments of his own, some in clairvoyance and some in\nthought-transference, and other ingeniously devised experiments, in\nwhich it appeared that clairvoyance and thought-transference were\nacting simultaneously.\nThe current number (September-October, 1893) contains some\nstriking cases of hypnotisation at a distance.\nAn article by the Editor, Dr. Dariex, describes a series of experi-\nments on this point, made by him in December, 1890, and January,\n1891, under very careful conditions, with a patient of his own, whom\nhe had previously hypnotised four times in the ordinary manner. He\nwas at the time of the experiments in his own house, about 800 metres\nfrom that of the patient. His first three attempts were completely\nsuccessful, the time of his elforts corresponding within a few minutes\nto the time when the patient became hypnotised. On the fourth occa-\nsion she felt a strong inclination to sleep, but succeeded by an effort of\nwill in resisting it. The fifth and last experiment failed.\nIn the other case described, the distance between the operator and\nsubject was very much greater. The account was sent to Professor\nRichet by Dr. Tolosa-Latour It relates to a hysterical patient of his\nin Madrid, in whose case he had previously used hypnotic treatment\nwith success. Dr. Tolosa-Latour was travelling from Paris on\nOctober 26th, 1890, and, while in the train between Poitiers and\nMignie, made an attempt to produce in his patient at Madrid\u2014first the\nhypnotic .sleep, and after it\n\u2014\n^'povr fixer Men Ja suggestion'''\u2014\na\nhysterical attack, which she had not had for a long time.

It was decided that in\nfuture the names of Members, Honorary Associates, and Associates be\nprinted in one consecutive list ; the names of Members being dis-\ntinguished by special type, and those of Honorary Associates by the\nprefix of an asterisk.\nOther matters of business having been attended to, the Council\nagreed to meet at the close of the Annual Business Meeting of\nMembers, to be held at 3 p.m. on January 26th, 1894, at the West-\nminster Town Hall.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 62nd General Meeting of the Society was held at the West-\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, December 1st, 1893, at 8.30 p.m.,\nProfessor Barrett in the chair. The attendance was unusually large.\nProfessor Lodge read a paper on \"The Difficulty of making crucial\nExperiments as to the source of the extra or unusual Intelligence\nmanifested in Trance-speech, Automatic writing, and other states of\napparent mental inactivity,\" which it is hoped will be published in a\nfuture number of the Proceedings.\nDe. Burton gave a brief account of some experiments in thought-\ntransference, \u2014of numbers,\u2014Avhich had succeeded when agent and\npercipient were placed back to back, but had failed when they were\nat some distance apart. He agreed with Professor Lodge as to the\ndesirability of pressing experiments on the influence of distance on\ntelepathic phenomena.\nA paper by Me. Chaelton T. Speee, on his reminiscences of\nMr. Stainton Moses, was then read by Mr. Myers. The paper, which\nis to appear in the forthcoming Part XXV. of Proceedings, described\nthe various phenomena which Mr. Speer had witnessed during the later\nyears of Mr. Moses' experiences. One incident which was mentioned\nelicited several questions. Mr. Speer stated that Mr. Moses bad, at a\ndark seance, clairvoyantly seen a face, and that at the same seance a\nname was written \" directly \"\u2014apart from Mr. Moses\u2014on a piece of\npaper on which Mr. Speer kept his hand. Afterwards Mr. Speer gave\n\f17G Joivraal of Society for Psyckical Research. [.Tan., 18!)4.\nMr. Moses several albums, in one of wliich was a portrait of the\ndeceased person whose name had thus been written. Mr. Moses identi-\nfied that portrait as corresponding to the face which he had seen.\nMr. Speer was now asked whether this could be explained by any\nunconscious indications given by himself, or by thought-transference.\nHe replied that while Mr. Moses was turning over the albums he\n(Mr. Speer) was in another part of the room, and looking another\nway ; nor did he even know which of the albums Mr. Moses was\nexamining, until he heard him exclaim, \" This is the face I saw.\"\nIn reply to other questions, Mr. Speer stated that difference of\nplace, or of the table round which the circle sat, did not influence the\nphenomena. When raps first came in the dining-table, Dr. Speer had\nit taken to pieces {i.e., legs unscrewed, &c.), to see if anything had\nbeen fraudulently done to it. It was an old heavy dining-table, which\nhad been in the house many years, and was found to be in its usual\ncondition.\nMr. p. W. H. Myers then addressed the meeting, discussing each\nin turn of the various hypotheses which might be framed to account\nfor the recorded phenomena otherwise than as genuine exhibitions of\nan unknown force. He concluded by remarking that, even for those\nwho thus admitted their genuine character, the problem of their true\npurport and veritable origin remained unsolved.\nA further return to the subject, with especial view to the question\nof the identity of the intelligence or intelligences concerned, would be\nmade at some future meeting.\nTHE CHARACTER OF MR. D. D. HOME.\nThe mediumship of D. D. Home has twice been discussed in this\nJournal\u2014-^vst in an article by Professor Barrett and myself, with a\ncollection of first-hand evidence, in a i^eview of The Life of D. D.\nHome (Vol. IV., p. 101); and again by myself in a review of The\nGift of D. D. Home (Vol. IV., p. 249). In these papers little was\nsaid as to the impression which Home's personal character produced\non his contemporaries. In Madame Home's two books, indeed, there\nis much on that subject ; and conversation with persons who had\nknown Home well (especially the late Dr. Hawksley) had convinced\nme that, after allowing for kindly exaggeration, the testimonies quoted\nby Madame Home were not far from the truth. Still it was desirable to\nobtain some judgment which, while founded on intimate knowledge,\nwas not influenced by any special belief or interest in the phenomena\nwith which Home was associated in most minds. The kindness of\nMr. Andrew Lang allowed me to see a letter written to him by an\n\fJan., 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 177\nAmerican lady of literary tastes, who was led by an incidental phrase\nof Mr. Lang's to state somewhat fully the view of Home's character\nto which a family intimacy during the later years of his life had led\nher. Miss Louise Kennedy, of Fairacre, Old Concord, Mass., allows\nrae to reproduce here the essential passages of her letter.\n\" Fairacre, Old Concord, Mass.\n''Jtily 18th, 1891.\n\"I knew Mr. Home very well. He became, in the latter years of his\nlife, an intimate friend of my family. A Frencli student of such things says\nof him that he was an amiable child, ua'u-e and believing, and the sport of\nforces of whose nature and power he was utterly ignorant. The physical and\nmental wreck he became (years after this appreciation was uttered) seems to\nconlirm the insight.\n\" The chief fact in his character was an egotism so unconscious, so simple,\nthat it was perfectly childlike. It seemed the most natural thing in the\nworld to him that he should be cared for, cossettod, and made the centre of\nthings. He was always contentedly expectant to be carried smoothly and\nluxuriously along the road. Thus his relations with Mrs. Lyon, which have\nbeen so effectual in blighting his reputation with the public, to those who\nhave the clue to his character are entirely in keeping, in a perfectly innocent\nway, with this readiness to take, this acceptance of the world at large as of\ncourse as fond of him as he was of himself, which we see in little children, to\nwhom every good office comes as a matter of course. His share in this\nadjustment of things was to be delightfully entertaining and gay, or sym-\npathetic and sentimental, or worldly and sarcastic, just as the jjassing mood\nor the casual companion persuaded ; but always genuinely while the moment\nlasted. Brightly intelligent, with a singular apprehensiveness of the surface\nof the situation he found around liim, which, together with a true though not\ndeep refinement of taste, would explain his acceptabnity among gently-bred\npeople, in spite of his humble upbringing, and apart from his wonder-work,\ning ; with a brdliant dramatic faculty which he always delighted to exercise,\nho was a man of marked social charm. Mr. James T. Fields, who had seen\nall the stars of the last generation, as of this, told me he placed him above\nany reader he had ever heard.\n\"Ho basked in admiration, and dehghted also to admire\u2014provided his\nown dues were not pinched thereby. No other medium had he a good word\nfor, nor any kind of manifestation he himself had not been favoured with.\nHe had no discretion in his speech when moved, but poured out denuncia-\ntion, taunt, scorn, in a delightfully untrammelled fashion, ' The Blavatsky\n'\noccupying an exalted place in his niche of execration. But apart from rivals\nin his own lines, he was warm-hearted, affectionate, and generous, and in\nmany respects a most fascinating man.\n\"A master study of his peculiar character (not on the Sludge lines\u2014 that\nmonumental waste of precious time) would be a striking addition to the\nhuman portrait gallery. Sludge was an elaborate anatomical manufacture\nfrom one small bone -and no portrait.

'\nAnd then he wrote a poem which\nthey say is meant for me '\n\u2014this without a shade of resentment or annoyance.\nIn fact, there was no trace of vindictiveness in his account of Mr. Browning.\nHe appeared to regard unbelief in himself, or dislike, as a mysterious\ndispensation he could not try to account for.\n\" His relations with his wife, a woman proud and fastidious in the highest\ndegree, were very charming, and she was deeply devoted to him, as she has\nproved in the books published since his death. To her he was the herald\nof a new dispensation. It was interesting to see an essentially cynical\nmind, with a knowledge of '\nthe world,' maintain this attitude of adoration\nfor the prophet, while for the man she was tenderly protective in\npractical fashion, with dashes of derision for his simplicity. He suffered\nterribly the last few years, and she was angelic, as he fully i-ealised. He\nwould talk of her unutterable patience with him in his extremities, and with\nhis graceless son. She falsified in every particular the traditional stepmother's\nrole, and forgave seventy times seven the ungrateful youth, because he was\nthe son of the man she so entirely worshipped. To her it was a privilege\nto spend herself for so precious a personality, I have dwelt on her par-\nticularly fine and self-contained character\u2014the very opposite of his \u2014because\nhis first wife has been the subject of so much eulogy, and little has been\nsaid of the one who devoted herself to his darkly shadowed days.\n\" You may say to all this, '\nQuite so, and distinctly mA. a desirable kind of\nperson.' Well, but at least not a schemer, nor a vulgar adventurer, which is the\nusual assumption about him. His belief in his function as a minister of the\n'\nother world '\nwas entirely solemn and awe-stricken, though, as he had the\npliability of mind which seems the groundwork of mediumship, and was\naffected by any current of thought around him, he may have given occasion\nto the doubter by entering into his mood. Indeed, he used to say that he\ncould not have believed the reality of the manifestations had they not\nhappened to himself. \"Louise Kennepv,\"\nIn a letter to myself Miss Kennedy states that she never personally\nwitnessed any of Home's phenomena.\nI may point out, in conclusion, how completely concordant on all\nmaterial points are all the testimonies known to me as to the character\nof D. D. Home. There are, indeed, wide differences in the liking\nor aversion felt for him ; but these differences seem to depend on a\nmatter so unimportant for science as the exact shade of effusiveness\nand familiarity of manner which his acquaintances were prepared to\nenjoy or to tolerate. That there must have been much in him which\nrefined and dignified persons (especially, perhaps, if not English by\nbirth) could admire and even love, the history of his two marriages\nsufficiently proves. But even if we take the unsympathetic man-of-\nthe-world's view of him ; if we regard him as a kind of drawing-room\nreciter in excelsis, or, as Mr. Lang has phrased it, \"a Harold\nSkimpole with the gift of divination,\" the result for our purposes is\n\fJan., 1804.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nmuch the same. Neither Home's character nor his abilities, as repre-\nsented either by friends or by foes, can be held to render it probable\nthat he was a master of ingenious and undiscoverable mechanisms, and\na lifelong traitor to his dearest friends.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nOASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nG. 244. Collective Apparition,\nFor the following account we are indebted to the Rev. C. H. Cope,\nan Associate of the S.P.R., who received it from Mr. G. A. Young, of\nThe Oaks, Faversham, Kent. It was written by a friend of the\nlatter's, Captain Emmett.\nThe following is an accurate statement of a supernatural occurrence that\ntook place at Gibraltar in the year 1839, and which was carefully investigated\nby myself on the day after it took place, accompanied by the Eev. Wdliam\nBrown, now residing at Gravesend, and never afterwards discovered to have\nbeen anything but that which it professed to be :\u2014\nIn the month of September, 1839, the Rev.W. Brown called upon me for\nthe purpose of making known that a story was current about the barracks of\nthe 46th Regiment, to the effect that a ghost or spirit had been seen in one\nof the hospital wards occupied by that regiment, then quartered at the\nbarracks on the Rock, called \"The South,\" adding that he thought the case\nworth investigating, as two persons were said to have seen it at the same\ntime.\nI went with him to the hospital, and after hearing a version of the story\nfrom the hospital sergeant, desired that one of the two men (not the\nprincipal) who had seen the vision might be sent for.\nA private of the 46th named Watson (and a patient in the ward) forth-\nwith attended, and was cautioned by me to be truthful in his statement as I\nwas about to take it down on paper for severe investigation. I then wrote\ndown from his mouth the following :\n\u2014\n\"Last night I was lying awake in bed some time after eleven o'clock,\nnot being able to sleep as there was a rushlight at the far end of the ward\nwhere one of the patients was dying ; also the ward had been disturbed for\nthe previous two nights by the sound of footsteps slowly walking up and\ndown the ward. Whdst turning round in my bed I saw someone sitting\nupon the foot of the bed of Corporal McQueen. At first I thought it was\nMcQueen himself, but distinguished his head on the pillow. The person\nsitting remained so still that I thought it sufficiently singular to call out to\nMcQueen, and I called to him, telhng him '\nthere was someone sittmg upon\nthe foot of his bed.' He waked up and drew up his knees, and at the same\ntime the person rose off the foot of the bed, and slowly went up to the head\nof it, rested one hand against the wall and stooped down as if to speak to\nCorporal McQueen. He drew back his head as if alarmed, and becomm\u00a7\n\f180' Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I spoke to him, and he made answer for me to go to sleep and not talk.\"\nI and Mr. Brown cross-examined Private Watson, and came fully to the\nconclusion that he was speaking truly according to his belief. He was not\nsuffering at the time from any disorder affecting the brain. We dismissed\nhim and called in Corporal McQueen. His disorder was simply an injury to\nthe foot or ankle, and likewise not affecting the brain. I warned him as I\nhad done Private Watson, and I then took down his statement in writing, as\nfollows :\n\"Last night about 12 o'clock I was awaked Ijy Private Watson, who sleeps\nopposite to me. He told me that there was someone sitting upon the foot of\nmy bed, and at the same time I saw a person just rising oil' it and coming\ntowards me. There was enough light by means of a rushhght at the other\nend of the room to let me see it was not one of the patients, and I gradually-\ndistinguished the dress to be grave clothes\u2014a long gown of flannel edged with\nblack tape, and tied up about the wrists and neck with bows of the same ; a\nkind of hood was swathed round the head and face. The figure leant down\nover me, and at first I felt much alarmed and shrank back. The figure said\nsomething, my name, I think, and added :\n'\nI am the spirit of Mary Madden,\nand bespeak your attention.'\n\" Mary Madden had been the wife of a comi'ade of that name, now at the\nDepot of the 46th in Ireland, and she had died just about this time last year,\nI was a great friend of hers, and was beside her when she died, and put her\ninto her coflin. She was dressed precisely tlic same as the figure then before\nme.\"\nQuedlon: \"Were the face and voice like Mrs. Madden's ?\n\"\nAnsiver : \"I could distinguish no face at all. The voice was not like\nMrs. Madden's, or any voice I had ever heard ;\nit seemed to shin tlii'<iiiijti vnj\nhead.\"\nThe witness continued :\n\u2014\n\" I then felt rather reassured, and asked her what she wanted. She\nreplied 'that I must communicate with her late husband, Madden, and\nseverely warn him as to a certain evil course he was pursuing ; that he was to\ndesist, and that, if he did not desist, his soul would be in immediate peril.'\nShe then told me to warn him of some other matter, and finished by telling\nme, hy u-ay of proof that slie was Mrs. Madden's sjyirit, a circumstance and\nconversation unknown to anyone in the world, that took place between us\nbofore her death, and this I must decline repeating. It ivas proof to me that\nMary Madden's spirit was then beside me, and notlivnej on earth will concince\nme to the contrary. After exacting a promise from me that I would fulfil her\nwish, she said she would not again trouble the ward, and bid me farewell.\nShe then went to the fireplace, and groped over it with her hands about the\nwall, then turned round and again came towards me, but gradually looked\nmore and more indistinct until at last I lo.st sight of her altogether. I then\nbecame very faint and awe-struck, and remained awake until daylight,\n\f.Tax., 18!H.] Journal of Societjj for PsycJdcal Research. 181\n\"I have this morning written to her hushand in Ireland, in compliance with\nher wish.

Williams, of 11, Cleveland-terrace, Coatham, Redcar.\n'\u2022September 23rd, 1889.\n\" I was living at home with my parents at Eston-in-Cleveland. There\nwas a working man called Long living in the village, not far from our house,\nwhose wife was taken ill. Dr. Fultcn, who at that time was staying with\nus, came in one night between 9 and 10 o'clock and said Mrs. Long was\ndying. After that we sat talking over the fire a good while, and then my\nsister Isabella and I went ofl' to bed. We slept in a back bedroom, and after\nwe got to this bedroom I said, '\nOli, I've forgotten something in the large\nbedroom. ' To this latter I proceeded by myself, and, as I approached the\ndoor, something seemed to say to me, '\nYou'll see something of Mrs. Long,\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychiccd Research, [Jan., 1894.\nliving or dead ! ' But I thought no more of this, and entered the bedroom,\nwhich I had to cross to the opposite end for what I wanted. When I had\ngot the things in my hand, I noticed a lovely light hanging over my head.\nIt was a round light\u2014perfectly round. I had taken no light with me, but\nwent for the things I wanted in the dark. I looked to see if there was any\nlight coming in from the windows, but there was none : in that direction\nthere was total darkness. I grasped one hand with the other and stood\nlooking at the strange light to be sure that I was not deceived and was not\nimagining it. I walked across the room to the door, and all the way the\nlight was hanging between my head and the ceiling. It was akin to the\nelectric light : sometliing of a cloud, though every part of it was beaming\nand running over with light. It left me at tlic bedroom door. On first\nseeing it a strange impression seized me, and after it left me I was so\nimpressed that I could not speak of it to anyone for a day or two. I\nwondered at the time whetlxer it had anything to do with Mrs. Long, and on\ninquiry I found that she died just about the time when I saw the light. If\nthere was any difference, I judged it would be a little before, but there\nwould not be much in it. This would be about 11 p.m., and about four\nyears ago. It left an impression on my mind wliich I have never forgotten,\nand never shall forget. Mrs. Long was not ill many days\u2014about two or\nthree ; she died rather suddenly. I was rather interested in her. I did not\nBee her during her illness, but had often seen her and talked to her before.\nI was perfectly well at the time, and was in no trouble or anxiety. My age\nat the time was 23. I have had no experience of the kind before or since.\nI saw no figure, only a lovely light. Before telling my sister I made her\npromise she would not ridicule me nor call me superstitious.\n\" To the best of my recollection this is a correct statement.\n\" Mary Helena WiLLiAJis.\nI'\np_g___The light which I saw was a palish blue. It emitted no rays, so\ntliat all the rest of the room was in darkness. It was wider in circumference\nthan my head, so that as I walked I could see it above me without raising\nmy head. As I left the room it remained, and when I looked again was\ngone. It was in a corner, where the darkness of the room was deepest and\nthe least chance of illumination from the windows on the right and left, that\nI first saw it above my head. I had no fear, but a kind of sacred awe.\nThe light was unlike any otlier that I ever saw, and I should say brighter\nthan any other, or, at least, purer. Looking at it did not affect the eyes.\nIt was midway between my head and the ceiling.\"\nThe sister who was with Miss Williams at the time corroborates her\naccount as follows :\n\" I recollect my sister Lily seeing the bright light. When she came back\nto the room where I was she was quite pale, and sat down on the floor. She\nwas so awe-struck that she did not tell us what she had seen till the next\nday. I remember that a woman who lived near us died about the time my\nsister saw the light, and that we connected the two circumstances together.\n^'August 8tK 1891.\" \"Isabella Fulton.\n\fJan., 1804.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 183\nIn the next case it would seem\"that the telepathic impression was received\nby a person for whom it was not intended.\nL. 967.

We had been in the house about a month,\nand I and tlie three youngest children were sleeping in the room on the\nfront landing hitherto occupied by Mr. Thompson's only sister, whose name\nis Margaret. I had not gone to bed, but was sitting over the fire about\n12 p.m., or later, when, hearing someone say 'Margaret,' I thought Mrs.\nThompson (who slept on the same landing) was calling me, and I went out\nof the room expecting to find her in the passage. I stood a moment, seeing\nno one there, and heard a deep sigh close to me. I was so astonished at\nhearing this and seeing no one, as I had quite expected, that I felt I could\nnot turn round, and I went backwards way into my room again and shut the\ndoor. It made me feel rather nervous. The next morning I told the\ngoverness what I had heard, and said to her, '\nI will not tell Mrs. Thompson,\nas she is nervous in this house.' This haj^pened on the Saturday night.\nOn the following Monday, February 10th, Mrs. Thompson got a telegram in\nthe afternoon to say Mr. Edward, her youngest brother-in-law, had just died\nquite suddenly of apoplexy at an hotel.\n\" I was in my usual health ;\nmy age was nearly 37 years.\n\"I had seen Mr. Edward about two months before, but we knew nothing\nof what he was doing at the time.

I had a vague sort of impression that a friend of mme, who\nwas then in South Africa, was appealing to me in some way, and was in\ndistress. I wrote out to South Africa at once, and after some months dis-\ncovered he was very ill, having fallen from the top of a house on that day.\n\"I was writing a letter to a comparative stranger.

[Jan., 1894.\n\" [On Friday of the saiue week] we arranged to visit Cambridge, and to\nspend several liours in that most interesthig town. On the return journey,\n[being] very tired, most complete was the silence which fell upon us. As\nfar as I can remember, no one had mentioned '\nBarrie's ' name since the\nusual inquiry had been made in the morning, and indeed, as a week had\nnow elapsed since his loss we were beginning [to give up the hope of\nrecovering him.]\n'\n' Like all the rest, I was in a semi-sleeping condition. I do not say asleep,\nfor then what follows would be a dream, and certainly it was scarcely that\nno, merely hi a tired condition of mind and body, I felt that peculiar sensa-\ntion which I am sure has been felt by many, that is, that though sufficiently\nawake to know what is going on around, still your real mind seems to be far\naway and almost separate from your surroundings. It seemed to me that I\nwas walking down a road, and before me I could see quite plainly the colley\ndog of which we had spoken and thought so much, being led by a man who\nheld hi)n with a rope. I followed him with interest until he was taken up to\na door Avhich I saw opened, and the flood of light from within showed me\nthe well-known figure of [Mrs. B.'s] maid-servant. It all appeared to\nme so vivid that I suddenly started up and said to Mrs. B., 'Edith\n\" Barrie \" is f(jund !\n'\nEveryone was taken aback by the suddenness of this\nstatement, and Mrs. B. laughingly said, 'Nonsense! how can you possibly\nknow, and why raise false hopes in my mind ?\n' I then, quite awake and\nlooking most intently at her, replied, '\nYes, he is found, and when we arrive\nat Station the first thing to happen will be that a porter will come up\nand say, \"Mrs. B., your dog is found.'\" Then I went on describing the\nscene of which I had just imagined myself to be a witness, saying, ' Ah,\nthere I see him going down the road. Now [the maid] is opening the\ndoor.' Here there was a universal laugh, and at last I joined in it, whereat\nall visions vanished. Still I nuiintained my opinion that the colley was\nsafe in , and when Dr. B. remarked that if all happened as I had said\nI should have a pair of gloves, I agreed, and promised him a pair if\n'\nBarrie '\nshould prove still to be missing.\n\" In about forty minutes after this the train drew up at ,\nand\nDr. B. opened the door and stepped out; just as he was giving his hand\nto Edith, a porter came up to her and said, 'Mrs. B., your dog is\nfound.' She exclaimed, '\nWhere is he ?\n' The man replied by whistling to\na fellow porter, who brought the dog from the other end of the platform,\nand '\nBarrie '\nwas soon overwhelming his mistress with rather boisterous\ncaresses. On our way home. Dr. B. remarked that I was only entitled\nto o)t,e glove, as the scene I had so graphically described of the dog being led\ndown the road was a myth. But on our arrival at the house, our first greet-\ning from the maid was, '\nOh, it really is your dog, Mrs. B. ; I would not\ntake him in when the porter brought him about three-quarters of an hour ago.\n\" I was paid [the] bet. \" C, H.

J. Balfour, in the chair. The meeting was a crowded one.\n^\nThe President, after referring to the loss the Society had sustained\nby the death of Dr. A. T. Myers and of our Corresponding Member,\nProfessor Hertz, spoke of the relation between the results the Society\nhas arrived at and the general point of view of science. Looking back\nto the facts brought forward by Mesmer a century ago, he found that,\neven allowing for the effect of Mesmer's error in inventing a bad\ntheory to account for them, the scientific world of the time had neg-\nlected its obvious duty of dealing with the new problem, and explain-\ning it if it could. At the same time he admitted that an age could not\nbe\" expected to do more than the special work set before it, and the\nspecial work of the last hundred years had been the reconstruction of\nalmost the whole body of sciences from top to bottom. Granting, how-\never, that men of science might have been justified in their attitude\ntowards Mesmer's discoveries for the past century, he could not admit\nthat they would be justified in maintaining that attitude towards\noccult subjects in the present day. He thought the time had come\nwhen, in their own interest, as in the interests of others, the leaders of\nscientific thought in this country and elsewhere should recognise that\nthere were well-attested facts which did not naturally fall into the\nframework of the sciences or of organised experience as they conceived\nit ; he thought that they should investigate these, or at least assist\n\fFeb., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 191\nothei's in doing so. Ho said that there were difficulties connected with\nthese investigations, witli which scientitic men are not famihar in their\nordinary work. There was the difficulty of fraud and unconscious self-\ndeception ; and there was the difficulty of dealing, as it seemed, with\ncases in which, not the normal five senses that all command, but some\nabnormal and half-completed senses come into play. Experiments\ncannot be repeated at will, because they deal with exceptional gifts of\nexceptional individuals. But he thought it unphilosophical to refuse\nto investigate because of these difficulties. For himself, he saw no\ninherent, no a 2^riori improbability in such half-formed senses being\nsporadically developed in the human race. So far from that, if the\ntheory of development and natural selection were really sound, it was\nexactly what one would expect, for it seemed unreasonable to suppose\nthat the senses, which had been elaborated because they were fitted\nto make the organism survive in the struggle for existence, should be\nin correspondence with the whole of external nature. There must\nbe countless forms of being, countless real existences, which, had the\nline of our evolution gone in a differeat direction, or had the neces-\nsities of our primitive ancestors been of a different kind, we might have\nhad senses enabling us to deal with experimentally. He would expect\nthat here and there we should find the Ijeginnings of such senses\u2014mere\nbye-products of the great natural manufactory, mere beginnings, never\ndestined to come to anything. It might be that in cases of abnormal\ndevelopment Ave came across faculties which, had it been worth\nN\"ature's while to develop them for any purpose in the struggle for\nexistence, would have been normally found in the whole race, and\nwould have enabled us to experiment on the phenomena v\/hich we now\nreo-ard as occult, with the same certainty that we investigate matters\nopen to the ordinary operation of the senses. If this were so, he did\nnot think that the irregularity of our results, which was one of their\nmost provoking characteristics, ought to furnish any argument against\nthe truly scientific character of our work.\nBut this theory of imperfectly developed senses was not enough, he\nthought, to account for all the difliculties with which we have to deal.\nIt was easy to imagine senses which we might have had, and which\nwould merely confirm results already arrived at by scientific men. But\nthe difficulty about our investigations was that we seemed to come across\nfacts which, if well established\u2014as they appeared to be\u2014could not, as\nhe judged, be made by any manipulation to fit into the interstices of\nthe accepted view of the physical world ;\nif that were so, we were\neno-aged in a work of prodigious difficulty, but of an importance of which\nthe difficulty was only a measure ; for we were on the threshold, so to\nspeak, of a whole new set of the laws of nature.\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1894.\nThere was, for instance, an accumulated mass of evidence for tele-\npathy, yet telepathy cannot be fitted in with the acknowledged\nscientific view of the universe, without doing it a violence which the\nfacts would not, he thought, bear. After pointing out some of the\ndifficulties of thus fitting it in, he said that the absence of anything\nexciting in telepathic experiments made them some of the best with\nwhich we can make a breach in the wall which now surrounds the\nuniverse as we conceive it to exist. He was aware that many\nmembers of the Society approached the subjects with which we\ndeal from a different point of view from that which he had\ntouched upon. We do investigate phenomena of a far more start-\nling character, and he thought we did well. He was far from\ndesiring to discourage those who wish to get direct evidence, for\nexample, of such a fact as the communication with intelligences not\nendowed with a physical organisation such as we have experience of.\nBut while there was sufficient evidence to make this a field of examina-\ntion well worthy of our efforts, it was not that in which our\nlabours come closest to existing scientific results. What he had\naimed at was to deal with the scientific aspects of our work,\nbeing desirous above all things to enlist in our service the best\nexperimental and scientific ability which we can command. If\nwe could repeat very definite and very simple experiments, which\ndo not fit in with hitherto accepted conclusions, sufficiently\noften and under tests sufiiciently rigid, it would be impossible for\nphysicists to ignore our results. They would have to help us, as far\nas they can, to unravel the very refractory class of problems with which\nwe are endeavouring to deal. Wliether their efforts or ours would be\ncrowned with success, he did not know. He had already indicated the\nspecial difficulties and limitations with which we had to deal. But if he\nrightly estimated the value of the results we had obtained, it seemed to\nhim that at least we should be able to prove that outside the world, as,\nscientifically, we have been in the habit of conceiving it, there lay a\nregion, not open, indeed, to experimental observation in the same way\nthat the more familiar regions of the material world were open, but\nstill with regard to which some information could be gleaned ;\nand if\nwe could not, as the result of our exertions, discover what laws\nthese strange phenomena obeyed, it would, at all events, be something\nto have shown, not as a matter of speculation or conjecture, but as a\nmatter of ascertained fact, that there were things in \" heaven and\nearth \" which were beyond the philosophy even of the most scientific.\nMr. Leap then read a paper by Mr. Andrew Lang, entitled \" Cock\nLane and Common Sense.\" The story of the Cock Lane Ghost was\nexamined, with the conclusion that the true solution of the puzzle had\n\fFeb , 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 193\nnot yet been found. Nai'ratives of similar occurrences in different\ncountries and at different periods were described and referred to, and\nthe \"common sense\" explanations which had been offered were criticised\nand found insufficient. With regard to the stories narrated in the\npaper, no conclusion, he said, could be drawn from them ;\nbut there\nwas a chain of such things through the ages, and in wandering in Cock\nLane they were in the company of savages, philosophers, divines, saints,\nand hypnotists.\nANNUAL BUSINESS MEETING.\nThe Twelfth Annual Business Meeting of the Members of the\nSociety was held at the Westminster Town Hall on January 26th\n;\nProfessor Sidgwick in the chair.\nIn opening the proceedings. Professor Sidgwick said he was glad to\nbe in a position to make a satisfactory report of the Society during the\npast year. The total number of Members of all classes had increased\nfrom 804 to 877. The American Branch had also increased during the\nyear from 480 to 521.\nAn audited statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Society\nduring 1893 was presented to the meeting. In the accompanying\nletter, the auditor says \" I have had the pleasure of auditing your\naccounts for 1893, and have duly certified their accuracy. I am glad\nto notice the same care exercised by Mr. Bennett; as has been always\nshown.\" The statement appears as usual in the Journal. Referring to\nthe financial position of the Society, the Chairman read a statement of\nassets and liabilities at the close of 1893. This showed an excess of\nassets of \u00a3260, as against the corresponding amount of \u00a3170 a year\nago ; no account being taken in either case of the value of the library,\nor of the stock of Proceedings. The whole of what had been received\nfor Life Subsci^iptions was now invested ; and as this amount is almost\nexactly equalled by the excess of assets above referred to, the financial\nposition may be considered sound and satisfactory. He also dwelt\nwith satisfaction on the prosperous condition of the American Branch.\nReferring to the \" Second Sight Inquiry,\" he said that \u00a334 had been\nexpended out of the fund placed at the disposal of the Society by the\nMarcpis of Bute, and that the inquiry was still in progress.\nProceeding to the annual election of a portion of the Council, the\nChairman said that no further nominations having been made since\nthe usual notice had been sent round to members, he had only to\ndeclare that Mr. G. P. Bidder, Q.C., Mr. Crookes, F.R.S., Dr. C. W.\nLockhart Robertson, and himself were duly elected.

[Feb.,\nnation to turn his inexorably restricted activities to the utmost account\nfor the service of mankind.\nArthur Thomas Myers was born at Keswick in 1851. His educa-\ntion was unusually compreheasive and well balanced. At Cheltenham\nSchool, and as an undergraduate scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge,\nhe studied chiefly languages and literature : but after taking a first\nclass in classics in 1873, he turned to science and medicine, obtained\nhonours in the Natural Sciences Tripos, and became an M.D. of his\nuniversity in 1881. After completing his medical training, he was\nhouse-physician at St. George's Hospital and registrar in the medical\nwards for some years, and afterwards\u2014almost till his death\u2014was on\nthe staff of the Belgrave Children's Hospital. Last year he was\nelected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He contributed\nvarious papers of interest to the leading medical journals ;\nand\nbut for the protracted remediless malady to which he ultimately\nsuccumbed, he would have had every prospect of attaining high\nmedical distinction.\nDr. Myers became a member of the Council of the S.P.R. in 1888 ;\nbut his active interest in the work of our Society dates from its\nfoundation : and though his professional duties in the earlier years of\nits existence, and increasing ill-health in later years, prevented him\nfrom taking a prominent part in our published investigations,\nthere is hardly any branch of those investigations in Avhich the\naid he has rendered has nob been\u2014in one way or another\n\u2014\nimportant. Especially valuable has been his counsel in all matters\nin which the lines of our researches have come into contact with the\nspecial sphere of the physician's study. This has occurred in various\nways. Sometimes the actual phenomena presented for investigation\nhave been alleged cases of healing by methods apparently involving\nan action of mind on body beyond what has yet been recognised as\npossible by established medical science : such as cases of \" faith-\nhealing \"or \"mind-cure,\" and the therapeutic marvels of Lourdes\u2014\n\u2022\non which a paper composed by him, in conjunction with his brother,\nMr. F. W. H. Myers, was published in the last number but one of our\nProceedings. Sometimes, again, though the scope of the investigation\nhas been purely psychological, the question of disease has become\nincidentally important, either as an alleged cause of the phenomenon\nstudied\u2014as in the case of spontaneous hallucination : or as an alleged\ndangerous effect to be guarded against, as in the case of hypnotism.\nIn all such cases Dr. Myers' advice and assistance have been constantly\nasked by our investigators and always ungrudgingly given ;\nand being\nat once fearless and circumspect, in full touch with the opinions and\nsentiments of his profession^ and yet singularly free from all professional\n\fFeb., 1894.] Jou\/mcd of Society for Psycldcal Research. 197\nbias or prejudice, he was excellently fitted for the function of adviser.\nIndeed, Ave may say that the main direction and management of the\nexperimental or other work that has been done in the department of\nhypnotism in connection v\/ith our Society has\u2014since Edmund Gurney's\ndeath\u2014been in his hands : and it should be added that the labour of\ngathering together the books and pamphlets, which render our\n\" Edmund Gurney Library \" probably the best collection in England\nfor the needs of a student of hypnotism, was almost entirely under-\ntaken by Dr. Myers. It is, indeed, impossible to recount all the\nways in which his unfailing kindness and generosity, his ready help-\nfulness, and his patient industry\u2014so long as industry was permitted\nhim\u2014have been employed in the service of our work ; but there can\nbe hardly anyone who has taken an important share in that work who\nwill not feel how difficult it will be to fill the gap that his loss has\nleft.\n\u2014\nEditor.\nPROFESSOR HEINRICH HERTZ.\n\"Hertz, De. Heinrich, was born in 1857, at Hamburg, and is\nthe son of Senator Dr. Hertz. He studied engineering till 1878, and\nthen devoted himself to physics under Helmholtz and KirchofF, at\nBerlin, where he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1880.\nHe was assistant to Helmholtz till 1883, when he became 'privat-\ndocent' in the University of Kiel. In 1885 he was made Professor of\nPhysics in the Technical College at Karlsruhe, and in 1889 succeeded\nthe late Dr. Clausius in the Chair of Physics at Bonn. In 1889 he\nwas elected an honorary member of the Manchester Philosophical\nSociety, and is also a corresponding member of the Royal Academy at\nBerlin. Most of his experimental work deals with electricity. To-\nwards the end of 1886 he detected a special action of ultra-violet light\nupon the electric discharge. In the following year he obtained\nevidence that electric induction was propagated through air with a\nfinite velocity. In the course of 1888 he succeeded in producing\nelectrical waves and rays in air, which had been predicted long ago by\nMaxwell, and which was studied theoretically by Fitzgerald, Heaviside,\nLodge, and others.\"\nThe above brief statement of facts, taken from the biographical\nportion of the Electrical Directory, pubUshed by the weekly journal\nThe Electrician, in which an English abstract of Hertz's work first\nappeared, does but scant justice to the immense interest excited in the\nscientific world by the famous researches of 1888. The importance of\nthese researches was instantly recognised in England, where they mel;\nwith a welcome altogether exceeding their reception on the Continent\n;\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1894.\ntor whereas theories of electricity were there ahiiost as numerous as\nleading Professors, here there was practically but one, and that Clerk\nMaxwell's. Theories of light, indeed, we had in some abundance \u2014\nthree or four varieties ; and the most recent of all, hardly known out\nof the British Isles, not much known, strange to say, north of the\nTweed, though well understood on the shores of the Liffey and well\nappreciated on the Mersey\u2014this latest theory of light, also the\noutcome of the brilliant genius of Clerk Maxwell, Avas on its trial ;\nand keen were the hopes of verifying it, not by mere concord of\nexperimental results, but by actual production of Radiation in the light\nof its indications. The way was clear and the details of difliculty Avere\nalready disappearing, when a nearly unknown German at the Poly-\ntechnicum of Karlsruhe, after a year's strenuous and magniticently\nordered Avork, begun almost in the dark, and not inspired by Clerk\nMaxwells theory at all, but guided by his own experimental instinct\nand the theories of his most eminent teacher, A^on Helmholtz, succeeded\nto the utmost of our expectations and demonstrated the existence of\nelectrical radiation, or the propagation of electric action in time,\nprecisely on the lines deduced in these islands from Clerk MaxAvell's\ntheory.\nFor the first time Light was linked to Electricity, and the nature\nof both became thereby far better understood than before. They are\nnow no longer distinct sciences ; the ether has to serve both\nfunctions : the eye is an electrical sense organ.\nHad Hertz not lived, the thing would have been done ; but that it\nwould have been done Avith the same completeness and ability may\nwell be dou])ted. For though it may be said that Hertz began in the\ndark, he did not finish so. As clearly as possible he recognised how\nMaxAvell's theory explained and corresponded Avith his every fact, down\nto the minutest detail ; and liis interest in thus Avorking out the anti-\ncipations of Avhat Avas to him a new theory must have been extreme.\nHe was not only an experimentalist. Like all the highest modern\nphysicists, he Avas Avell endoAved Avith mathematical poAver, and Avell\ninstructed in mathematical methods. Conjoined Avith these Aveapons he\npossessed a true physical instinct, as well as ingenuity of device and\nmanipulative skill. When these things co-exist in an individual, that\nindividual is a born physicist, of whom much may be expected.\nAdded to these things.

Here, number of students and other\nsuch responsibilities doubtless made work more difficult, but many of\nhis pupils continued his researches, and his experiments have been\nrepeated and extended in nearly all the physical laboratories of the\nworld.\nSuch and so great a man was among our Corresponding Members.\nDuring a visit to England in 1890 to receive a medal from the Royal\nSociety, he betrayed an interest in psychical matters, and related to the\nwriter some experiences which had convinced him that there was\nmatter for investigation in these \" occult \" regions. He did not intend\nto go out of his way to meet phenomena, nor in the slightest degree to\ndesert his physics for them, but he professed himself ready to investigate\nthem when called upon, and he became a foreign Member of the\nS.P.R.\nThat we can no longer number him among us is a disappointment\n\u2014a bittei- disappointment to his co-workers in Physics\u2014but he was\nnot strong in body, and on January 1st of the present year he was\ncalled away at the early age of 36. 0- J-\nTHE COMMITTEE FOR THE SYSTEMATIC INVESTI-\nGATION OF HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA.\nSince the formation of the above Committee in October, 1893,\neleven meetings have been held at the Rooms of the Society. Up to the\npresent the Committee have had to regi-et the dearth of \"subjects \" for\nexperiment, though they are grateful to two or three members of the\nSociety who have shown a disposition to help in this respect. Unless\nsome help is given in securing the presence of persons likely to be of\nuse as subjects, the Committee are obliged to fall back upon young\nmen, generally uneducated, who are accustomed to being hypnotised,\nand who have to be paid for their time. There are obvious objections\nto this plan, and the Committee continue to hope that members of the\nSociety will bear their needs in mind and refer them to any cases\nwhere opportunity for experiment exists.\nWith paid subjects the Committee have observed most of the usual\nphenomena of hypnotism\u2014insensitiveness, alternating memory, post-\nhypnotic hallucinations, and so on ; but most of their time has been\nspent in the endeavour to observe the phenomena of thought-trans-\nference. In this quest they have not up to the present met with much\nsuccess\u2014in fact, taking \" number-guessing,'' to Avhich class of experi-\nments they have mainly attended, the successes have on one occasion\nonly (when Mr. G.

On the occasion referred\nto, when the operator and the subject were both in the same room, the\nlatter rightly guessed six out of eleven mimbers of single digits\nsuccessively gazed at by Mr. Smith, and in a second series of\neleven similar trials on the same evening two guesses were correct\u2014\n\u2022\nthus making a total of eight correct guesses out of twenty-two. This\nsubject also seemed rather successful in describing other small objects\nlooked at by Mr. Smith, and it is intended to carry out some further\ntrials with him if he can be induced to attend with regularity.\nMrs. Pitman-Hooper, who has kindly put herself to a good deal of\ntrouble, has introduced the case of a young girl who suffers from\nfrequent epileptic fits \u2014practically daily\u2014and it is hoped that the\nhypnotic treatment now commenced may have some beneficial effect.\nThe Committee, in again appealing to Members and Associates to\nrender some help if possible, desire to remind those interested (1) that\nthe assistance of persons who are known to be susceptible to the action\nof hypnotism is much desired ; and (2) that persons who are not known\nto be susceptible, but who may be willing to attend regularly for syste-\nmatic experiments in hypnotism and thought-transference, are invited\nto write to any member of the Committee, whose names were given\nin the Journal for December, 1893, p. 187.\nJanuary 10th, 1894.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not rcsjwnsible fur ojyinions exjjressed hy CorrcqMndcids.]\nSPIRITISTIC HORSEPLAY.*\nTo the Editor of the JouKNAL OF THE Society for Psychical Research.\nSir, \u2014In the Experiences of Mr. Stainton Moses, included in the current\nnumber of the Proceedings of the S.P.R., spiritistic phenomena are, for\ntlie tirst time, put forward as such, having avowedly for their object\nthe confirmation of Spiritism and nothing else.

Such are, that the less can contain the greater\nor that two bodies can occupy the same space at the same tnne, or that\nmatter can pass through matter. In questions of this character, the veracity\nof the witnesses, or their liability to hallucination, are superfluous and\nirrelevant considerations. The thing is impossible, and there is an end of it.\nIf we once surrender our reason in such matters, we are cast like waifs upon\na sea of speculative ignorance where we can be sure of nothing-not even\nof our own existence. To a certain extent, this is unavoidable in deahng\nwith psychical phenomena, because of our ignorance of the fundamental\nlaws which govern them ; and this ignorance is our prmcipal difliculty lu\ninvestigating them ; but the same cannot be said of the laws of matter\nand it is not the way to begin an investigation into subjects we do not\nunderstand by throwing over immutable and impregnable laws m others\nwith which we are already well acquainted. Yet this is what we must do if\nwe admit for a moment the possibility of matter passing through matter.\nAnd I am disposed to labour this point somewhat, for two reasons. irst,\nthatthe claim to have seen matter pass through matter throws doubt upon\naU evidence coming from the same source ;\nand, secondly, that the mora\nweakness which could admit of credence in such an impossibdity would itselt\npredispose to, and even suggest (in the technical sense), other hallucinations\nand delusions . With the knowledge we now possess of the effects of suggestion\nand the complexities of personality-a knowledge which it is only fair to say\nwas not available when Mr. Moses began his seances -it is easy to see that\nnothin- more unwise could be attempted than to embark upon experiments\nof this kind without keeping a firm grasp upon first principles, and a resole\nnot to resign the guidance of Reason, but always to keep the reins of\nexperiment within her grasp. Instead of doing this, however, and boldly\ndictating to the unseen agency the conditions under which it was to act, Jli.\nMoses seems to have weakly suffered himself to be led, or rather driven\nback, over a line of retreat against the promptings of his normal and more\nhealthy mind. Thus in December, 1872, he writes that the communications\nare \"generally marked by evidences of intellectual weakness, and that\nit is prima facie extremely unlikely that the spirits of the noble, the learned\nand the pure should be concerned in the production of physical and\nintellectual phenomena which, when not silly, are frequently mischievous,\nand when distinctly true are not new, and being new are not true. . .\n.\nThe voice from beyond the grave is uncertain, and when it can be tested\nfrequently delusive, if not absolutely and mischievously false.\" Yet, according\nto Mr Myers, he came in a few months more to believe completely m the\nidentity of the communicating intelligences. A still sadder instance of\nthis decadence is to be found m the gradual surrender of the medium s\nlifelonc. convictions on religious subjects, a surrender made with open eyes\nand in^defiance of his own clear and even forcible indications of the ' spirit\nteachings\" as contrary to Scripture and to the fundamental dogmas of the\nChristian Faith. I shall, however, return briefly to this part of the subject\nlater on. It is time to consider the material facts, or alleged facts, on which\nthe claims to real spiritist agency in this case rest.\nWith regard to some of these I have already urged that they are not only\n\f^02 journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FiTB., 1894.\nimpossible, but unthinkable, and therefore unworthy of further consideration.\nYet, even were this not so, there would remain some further objections to\nthem, which it is as well not to overlook. Thus we are not only told of the\npassage of matter through matter, but of objects brought from outside\u2014in\none instance from a distance of half a mile. A \" crucitix of blue enamel,\nwith a handsomely-cliased figure of the Saviour, unknown to all of us,\" and\n\"a small heap of seed pearls\"* placed before each of the sitters, were\namong these objects. Now, either these objects were evolved out of Avhat\nHans Breitmann calls the \" Ewigkeit,\" which is contrary to another axiomatic\nlaw\u2014ex nihilo nihil fit\u2014or they were stolen from some human being outside\ntlie \"circle,\" which does not speak highly for the morality of the spirit\nworld. A more important question arises on this point, a question which has\nagain and again been asked, but never answered : Why, if objects can thus be\nbrought from a distance, through walls and locked doors, cannot a bank-note\nfor \u00a31,000 be withdrawn from the cellars of the Bank of England ? I ask the\nquestion in no spirit of vulgar cupidity, but as proposing a test which would\nestablish the claims of the s^jirits once for all, and silence the most inveterate\nscoffer. For imagine the sensation and excitement that would bo produced.\nBank-notes are all numbered, and this one would be missed almost at once. It\nwould be advertised for, and the papers would be full of the mysterious loss.\nThen would come forward the triumjohant medium and say, \" Here is your\nnote, which the spirits brought out of the Bank safe into the presence of all\nthe assembled circle.\" I fear, however, that the spirits will continue to select\ntheir own tests, instead of those which would satisfy other people.\nLet us, however, now pass on to consider those statements which, however\ndifficult of credence, are not absolutely impossible in the nature of things,\nand inquire how far, if we grant the facts for argument's sake, we are bound\nto accept the spiritistic theory also. No doubt that theory, in some form or\nother, is as old as man himself. But, as regards modern Spiritism, I think it\nis not difficult to account for its origin thus. The earliest manifestations were\nput down by most persons to fraud. But in cases where fraud either could\nnot be established, or was not admitted by believers, what other agency\nremained 1 No natural agency being apparent, the supernatural suggested\nitself, and was eagerly accepted by minds disposed to receive it. There was\nthe more reason for this, in that the scejjtics could produce no argument\nagainst it, except a blank denial of the facts, which the others refused to accept\nagainst the evidence of their own senses. In maintaining the notion of\nsupernatural causes for unexjjlained phenomena, they did but follow the\nexample of human nature everywhere. In countries devoid of astronomical\nknoAvledge, eclipses are attributed to the action of evil spirits, and in those\nwhere the operations of suggestion and personality are not understood, raps and\nautomatic writing are similarly accounted for. Then the notion of spiritual\nagency, once started, tended to work itself out as a suggestion in future cases,\nand subsequent exjjerimenters could not exclude the consciousness of this\nhypothesis, whether they fully accejjtcd it or not. From this point of vieAv\n*Why \"seed \"pearls? Why not as easily \"ropes of pearls,\" d la Lothair?

The passive personality, equally with the active, conscious one,\nnaturally takes the line of least resistance, and ui tlie absence of any definite\nguidance will fall back upon Spiritism as the most rough and ready line to take,\nand having taken the part, will act up to it with all the astonishing aptitude\nand vraisemblance which it shows in other rules under appropriate suggestion.\nThe absence, therefore, of any original prepossessions in favour of Spiritism\nwas no protection for Mr. Moses in default of some definite theory of another\nkind which could act suggestively in its own direction. Had he firmly\ntold \" Imperator,\" or \" Mentor,\" or whatever ridiculous name the spirit\"\nassumed, that its real name was Jenny Jones and that she was a milkmaid,\nit is permissible to suppose that the suggestion would have been acted on,\nand that instead of the dreary records of pretentious, commonplace, and\nheterodox theology which are found in Spirit Teachings, we should have had\nmore interesting and certainly more enlivening discussions on curds and whey.\nApart from\u00b0the causes I have suggested above as having given rise ro\nthe spiritist theory, it is remarkable that the many obvious indications\nof an originating source within the medium's own organism for the\nphenomena we are considering should have been overlooked. It would\nbe more correct, however, to say that they have been deliberately rejected.\nThus, we read in the Experiences (page 249) that \" the phenomena were at\ntheir best when he\"\u2014i.e., Moses-'^ was in his best health, and declined or\ndisappeared altogether when he was ill.\" \" The utterances of other controls\nfor the most part reflect Mr. Moses' own opinions on other mediums \" (page\n255). \"Illness of one of the sitters will cause the scent to be coarse and\npungent \" (page 271). A \"harmonious condition \" is described as being one\nin which \"the physique is in most perfect order \" (page 274). \"The experi-\nments made were attended with very great subsequent prostration\" (page\n276).\n\" Several attempts were made to elicit actual melody at various tmies,\nbut 'the med ium not heiivj of a musical turn of mind, this attempt invariably\nfailed\n\"\n(page 282. The italics are mine). There are other similar passages, and\nthe state of\u00b0the barometer is also frequently alluded to. Of course. Spiritists\naccount for these symptoms in their own way, but the facts are none the less\nsignificant. Hints of the influence of suggestion and mental expectancy are\nftlso to be found in such passages as \"round the table three persons sittmg\nwith a hush of expectation and faces (if they could have been seen) of awe-\nstricken earnestness \" (page 290). Mr. Myers thinks that the general concor-\ndance of phenomena only proves that they are not alleged at random. With\ndeference, it seems to me to prove something much more significant, viz., the\ninfluence of recorded experiences acting suggestively on other minds. Agaui,\nI think a point has been missed in connection with the great or historical\nnames claimed by the alleged spirits. If we regard the communications as\nproceeding from the medium's latent consciousness, it is easy to see why\nwell-known names should turn up rather than such as he never heard of ;\nbut otherwise it is ditticult to understand why the Dicks, Toms and Harrys\nof those days should not have had as easy access to him as anyone else.\nIt is time, however, to consider the facts vouched for as having happened\nat the sittings with Mr. Moses, or at least such of them as are not contrary tu\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Not that their value as evidence\nis directly affected by their intrinsic inanity, as long as all that is claimed for\nthem is the demonstration of some hitherto undetected or obscure natural\nforce ; but when they are asserted to be the work of some high and mighty\nspiritual potentates, who adopt this method of bringing before mankind\nteachings of vast importance to his present and future welfare\u2014 teachings,\nmoreover, which are to supersede as antiquated, forsooth, the fundamental\nti'uths common to all Christian bodies \u2014the vigour with which one is inclined\nto repel such claims is lost in a sense of their overpowering absurdity.\nPlaying football with the hassocks (page 262), blowing penny whistles (page\n316), squirting scent in the faces and eyes of the circle, thumping and banging\nthe furniture in a way that seemed alarming and was certainly unmannerly\n\u2014these are a sample of the harlequinade which, according to Mr. Myers, had\nfor its \"avowed object the promulgation through Mr. Moses of certain\nreligious and philosophical views.\" I have heard of sermons in theatres, but\nnot of their being delivered by the clown. Mr. Moses, by the way, speaks\ndisparagingly of tlie witch of Endor and her \" unholy incantations.\" Why\nany more unholy than his own ? They were at least as far removed from the\ninfinite silliness of the latter as Hamlet is from Touchstone. And the contrast\nis worth enlarging on, because the story of the witch is such as we might expect\nto accompany anything so awful as the visit of a spirit from beyond the grave.\nThe scene, the actors, the occasion, and the message were each worthy of the\nrest, and combine to produce a narrative of the most intense tragedy. No\nroom for wonder is there that at the end of the awful message, culminating\nin the pi'ophecy, \"To-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me,\" the\nunfortunate monarch \"fell straightway his full length upon the earth.\" Mr.\nMoses would have been better advised not to suggest the comparison.\nThere is another class of evidence, however, Avhich may appear more\nforcible than noises and smells ; and that is, visible apparitions. I do not\nwish to depreciate the importance of visual evidence, which will rightly be\ndeemed the strongest of any depending upon sensory impressions ; but it\ncannot be considered as conclusive in view^ of the undoubted fact that\n- phantasms have been exi^erimentally produced, not only in the presence of\nthe medium, as in the experiences before us, but even at a distance. And\nthis, too, in cases when the percipients were in no expectation of anything\nabnormal, and were unaAvare of the fact that the experiment was to be tried.*\nLastly, there remains of evidential claims what will doubtless be relied\nupon above all\n\u2014\ni.e. , connnunications from alleged spirits of facts subsequently\nverified, although unknown to the medium at the time. Of course the\nfirst objection to these is, that they may have been latent in his unconscious\n\"\nSee Journal S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 307, and Phantasms of the Living, \"Vol. I.,\npp. 99-110. It is greatly to be desired that in future cases these experiments should\nbe varied by endeavouring to impress upon the percipient some other image thaii that\nof the agent himself. Cf. op. cit , p, 102, case of Lieut. N,\n\fFeb., 1894.] Joiimal of Society for Psychical Research. 205\nmemory ; and this objection would in the nature of things be extremely\nhard to set aside. But I do not rely upon it alone. Let it be granted that\nveridical information is imparted upon matters which the medium never\npreviously heard of. Then I submit the following propositions :\n\u2014\n1st. Everything which a disembodied spirit can do (being, so to speak,\nonly half a man), a living man with the full powers of both mind and body\ncan do a fortiori. Even if this proposition be denied, it is impossible to\nprove the converse, and probability, at least, is on my side.\n^\n2nd. Every alleged fact is capable of verification or it is not. If it ia\nnot, then cadit quedio ; but if it is, the fact must be on record somewhere,\neither in documentary or printed shape, or in the mind of some living\nperson. If so recorded, it is impossible to show that it has not been\nclairvoyantly or telepathically perceived.\nI have thus endeavoured to deal with the various classes of facts vouclied\nfor in the account before us. With classes only ;\nfor to have criticised each\ncase singly would have required a paper of the same portentous length as\nthe Ejiperiences themselves. But I am unaware of any alleged fact\nwhicli does not fall within one or other of these classes. To sum up : I\nwish to reject as impossible and unthinkable the claim that matter can\npass through matter. This claim goes utterly beyond what we are\naccustomed to call \"the supernormal,\" because it involves contradictions\nof axiomatic, mathematical truth, and if I thought I saw such a thing happen\nwith my own eyes, I should refuse to believe it all the same.* With regard\nto the remainder of the testimony, I have urged that, while there is nothing\nirreconcilable with the facts being treated as manifestations of suggestion,\ntelepathy, or telekinesis, (although admittedly of an extreme and\nremarkable type), there is much, on the other hand, to point to their having\ntheir origin and development within the organism of the medium. It will\nbe surprising, however, if many other readers do not take the shorter way\nof disbelieving the records altogether.\nThe last head of my subject is concerned with the \"teachings\" which\nit was the declared object of the phenomena to enforce. As a mere\npoint of evidence it is impossible to disregard these. For when extra-\nordinary facts are alleged to have for their purpose the support of certain\ndoo-mas, it is distinctly germane to the question to inquire whether the\ndogmas are of such a nature, either as regards their importance, their novelty,\nor ''their moral value, as to justify and account for their introduction in\n* Mr. Myers speaks of a \" power of dis-aggregating matter and re-aggregating it \" ;\nbut I fail to see how dis-aggregated matter could pass through a brick wall any more\nthan matter in the mass. Other writers, more definitely, but with less caution, have\ncalled the process \" dematerialisation.\" It is sufficient to point out that dematerialised\nmatter is a contradiction in terms. These writers, however, remind one of a\ncertain Volunteer colonel, in the early days of the movement, who was\nmore conversant with double-entry than with double columns, and who,\nwishing to manceuvre his regiment out of a field through an ordinary gateway, could\nfind no\u00b0better command for the purpose than \u2022' Fall out for five minutes and fall in\nagain on the other side of the gate \" ! Something analogous to this, I suppose, is what\nhappens to matter in its passage through matter. It is really impossible to treat such\nideas serio'jsly,\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1894.\nsuch .1 startling fashion. The two sides of the question thus to a certain\nextent react on one another. Tlie startling facts are out of liarmony with\nthe banality of the dogmas based upon them, and tlie serious teaching is\ndiscredited by the grotesque phenomena. In the one case the mountain\nbrings forth a mouse ; in the other, the mouse is made to bear the Aveight\nof the mountain. For of the religious seriousness of the TeacJiings there\ncan be no question, whatever may be thought of their intellectual calibre.\nThis is not the place to discuss theological questions ; but as the Teachings\nare concerned almost wholly with theology, and the conduct of man in refer-\nence thereto, it is impossible, in dealing with thom, to avoid the subject.\nAnd since, without the supernatural origin which they claim, they would\nbe obviously unworthy of attention, we must be content to regard them, for\nthe nonce, as possessing it, in order to see where such teachings are likely\nto lead those who follow them. It will be seen, then, by anyone who has\nthe patience to examine the work, that it shows a gradual advance from\ngently insinuated scepticism of a rationalistic order to open and blatant\ndenial of the cardinal truths of Christianity. As the spirits themselves are\nmade to say, \" we have loosened the ropes one by one gradually and gently,\"\nxintil at length they could venture to deny the Divinity of Christ,\nthe vicarious Atonement, and the authority of Holy Scripture, and to pour\ncontempt upon its authors, from Moses to Paul. No wonder that these\nsame Scriptures contain express warnings against \" giving heed to seducing\nspirits and doctrines of demons,\" or that they denounce, in scathing language,\nall attempts to have communications with them.* Let there be no mistake,\nthen, on this point\u2014that those who follow such teachings as these can no\nlonger profess Christianity, or consider themselves Christians in any valid\nsense. I have before remarked on the unhappy facility with which Mr.\nMoses suii'ered himself to be driven from his orthodox mo(3ring.s. Not that\nhe did not meet the \"teachings \" with arguments that will seem, I think,\ncogent and logical to most minds. But he seems to have surrendered, not\nto superior reasoning, but to simple dogmatic assertions whose only weight\nwas in the source from which they claimed, and he believed them, to come.\nOn this ground alone, Mr. Moses appears to have accepted a mass of\nsermonising dogma, and of shallow infidelity, such as used to be thought\ngood enough for shopboys and loafers on Sunday afternoons at Clerkenwell\nGreen.\nThe subject is not worth pursuing further. It is more satisfactory to note\nthat no very noticeable result has followed the introduction of this new revela-\ntion which was to supersede and eclipse the ancient faith. Christianity, which\nsurvived the persecutions of Rome and the assaults of Voltaire, has not\nsuccumbed to Mr. Moses and \" Imperator.\" Nor, it may be safely said, will\n\"If ever there was \"a woman that hath a familiar spirit,\" Mrs. Piper, with her\nDoctor Phinuit, is one. If Mr, Moses and others hke him are not \" consulters with\nspirits\n\" and \"necromancers,\" there is no meaning in words. That is, of course, on\nthe supposition that the powers they profess are real, and are due to spirits from\nbeyond the grave.

She was of course under an\nantesthetic. When she awoke, after completion of the operation, she\nsaid she had no recollection v>'hatever of what had occurred. When I\ncalled on her on November 7 th, she said she had had severe neuralgia\nduring the night in the situation of the operation. During the con-\ntinuance of this pain, and while half awake and half asleep, she\nthought she could follow each step of the operation of November 3rd.\nShe described the cutting and slipping of the steel chisel, the blows of\nthe mallet, and scraping back of the gum\u2014in fact, it seemed to her\nthat she tmderwent the whole operation again.\n(2) A lady to whom I told the above said she once took \" gas \" for\na tooth extraction. This was quite successful, for she \" felt nothing.\"\nBut on an occasion subsequent to this she had a return of toothache\n\u2014\nsome time in the night. She declared that she could then feel all the\nsymptoms of becoming unconscious while inhaling the gas ; then came\nthe digging of the forceps to get a grip on the tooth, the wrench, and\nawful pain\u2014every detail was \" felt \" now, although her waking\nconsciousness had been quite unaware of any pain during the actual\nextraction.\n(3) I have many times noted that people while anresthetised, who\ndo not feel pain in the ordinary sense, and who on coming to themselves\ndeclare that they did feel no pain during the operation, have struggled,\ngroaned, spoken, or given some other evidence that some stratum of\nPAGE\n209\n. 210\n215\n223\n224\n\f210 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mae., 1894.\ntheir consciousness was awake during the antesthesia, and was being\nimpressed by the pain of the operation.\nThe above appears to show that the subliminal consciousness does\ntake note of what is going on, while the work-a-day self is oblivious to\nall external stimuli when under the influence of an anajsthetic ;\nand\nthat the memory of this subliminal self may be brought to the surface by\nsome appropriate stimulus, such as the neuralgia, which, we may note,\noccurred between sleeping and waking\u2014that is, at a time when the\nsubliminal is more active than the supraliminal stratum of our con-\ncious personality.\nAnalogous to the foregoing is the fact familiar in hypnotism,\nwhere it is often possible to recal a memory in the subject after awakeu-\nino- of what has been done and said during his hypnosis.\nMle to Case \/.\u2014The patient did not see the operator's instruments\nat all, nor was she told after the operation how it was done, but \u2022\nmerely that the tumour had been cut away entirely and successfully.\nNo one was present at the operation except the patient, operator, and\nmyself. The operation was described by the patient as accurately as a\nnon-medical person was likely to do. It may be thought that she was\nenabled to describe the operation by her vivid imagination ;\nbut under\nthe circumstances I should regard this \" vivid imagination \" as only\nanother name for her subliminal memory.\nWith regard to Case II., as I was not present during the extraction\nof the teeth, I know none of the details.\nIn each of these two cases I was of course careful not to suggest to\nthe patient the details of the operation\u2014such as \" Did you feel this or\nthat 1\n\"\nI merely asked them twice over to tell me what they felt.\nBoth the patients were thoroughly under the influence of the\nana?sthetic\u2014chloroform in the first case, and nitrous oxide gas in\nthe second.\nC.

Consul, Trieste, Austria.\nNovemhcr 8th, 1893.\nOn January 1st, 1886, I was appointed Her Majesty's Consul for Mada-\ngascar, to reside at Tamatave, the town at that time being in a disturbed\nstate and occupied by the French.\nMy wife was anxious to accompany me, but, as she was expecting her\nconfmement, it was decided she should go to the French Island of Reunion\n\fMm, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 211\n(Bourbon) for the event, and until a residence could be prepared in Tamatave,\nfit for a woman to live in. Consequently, at about the same time, she sailed\nfrom England for Reunion, and I sailed for Tamatave, where I was fortunate\nenough to secure a missionary's house as a temporary Consulate.\nUpon December 12th, 188G, my wife was confined at HellBourg (in the\ncommune of Salazie), in Reunion, but I heard nothing of the birth in Mada-\ngascar for over a month afterwards.\nI spent my Christmas Day alone at Tamatave, but on the night of\nChristmas Eve (December 24th, 188G) I dreamt a dream respecting my wife\nand then woke up. On the following morning (Christmas Day), in a letter to\nmy wife at Reunion, I wrote a correct account of this dream. By the way.\nReunion is about 600 miles from Tamatave.\nWhat I dreamt proved afterwards, to my great surprise, to be correct in\nevery particular. It must bo borne in mind, however, that at that time I\nknew nothing of the birth of my child having taken place\u2014indeed, I was not\ncertain as to when the event was expected.\nI dreamt that I received several letters from Her Majesty's Consul in\nReunion urging mo to come over at once to see my wife, who was dangerously\nill ; that I went, and was ushered up some stairs to her by the Consul's\nwife, when I found my wife very ill indeed in bed.\nI then awoke, and, as I have already said, the following morning wrote,\nhalf jokingly and merely for something to say, the whole matter to my wife,\nnever thinking for a moment there was likely to be any truth in the\ndream.\nA few weeks later, however, I did receive several letters from the Consul\nat Reunion, all arriving almost together, though sent to Tamatave by various\nvessels (sailing and steam), begging me to come over at once, as my wife had\nbeen taken dangerously ill on the night of December 24th, with complica-\ntions after childbirth. I sailed by the first vessel, and I am happy to say found\nmy wife recovered ; but it is singular that the room in which she had lain\nwas at the top of the stairs I had seen in m}' dream, and the position of the\nbed was the same. Further, hers was the only house in the whole of Salazie\nthat had any stairs at all \u2014every other house there being (as is the custom in\nthose parts) built on one floor. The wife of the Consul at Reunion had\nmost kindly attended my wife in her illness on this particular night\n\u2014\nDecember 24th, 188G.\nI regret to say that the letter I wrote to my wife from Tamatave on\nDecember 25th is lost. It has eitlier lieen torn up, or accidentally destroyed\nin the hurricane that wrecked the new Consulate in 1888 ; but my wife can\ncorroborate this statement,\n-loHN E. Haggard,\nH.M. Consul.\nMrs. Haggard writes :\n\u2014\nOn December 12th, 1886, my eldest child was born at Hell-Bourg, in the\nCommune of Salazie, Island of Reunion. My husband was then Consul for\nMadagascar, residing at Tamatave. He had been over to Reunion to see me\nabout a month previously, when I was staying with the English Consul for\nthe Island and his wife ; but he had never seen the house which I subse-\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mah,1894.\nquently rented for myself during ray confinement. After tliat event I was\nquite well till December 24tli, when I was taken suddenly ill. The Consul\nwrote news of me to my husband, but I did not at the time know what he\nsaid.\nThe Frijnch were just then evacuating Tamatave, which, owing to the\nconfusion of transports coming and going, greatly added to the usual dislo-\ncation of the mails between Tamatave and Reunion. About a month, how-\never, after my illness, when I was recovering, I received\u2014after a long\ninterval of silence\u2014a letter from my husband, dated December 25th, telling\nmo that he had not up till then heard of the birth of my child, but had had\na strange and vivid dream about me. On December 24th he invited two or\nthree British subjects to dinner, which ended quite early, he going to bed\nabout ten. He then dreamed that I had had a son (it was really a\ndaughter), and that I had been quite well until that particular evening,\nwhen I was suddenly taken ill. Thus far he dreamed that his information\nwas derived from a letter from the Consul in Reunion. He then further\ndreamed that he came over to see me, and Avas taken to ray house by the\nConsul's wife, who showed him the way upstairs to my room, where ho found\nme better, and here the dream ended.\nThe strangest part of the matter\u2014setting aside the exact coincidence of\ndates with events, even the hour being the same\u2014was the fact of the stairs\nin my house. Like most places subject to landslips and earthquakes, Hell-\nBourg consisted entirely of one-floored buildings. With the exception of\nthe hospital, I believe my house was the only one in the village with a\nstaircase in it ; and when he had last seen me my husband did not know I\nwas going to take a house at all, my plan then being to go down to the coast\nfor my confinement. He had, however, been informed by letter that I\nintended to take a house and remain, but the house itself he did not know.\nAgnes M, Haggard.\nBritish Consulate, Trieste, November 9th, 1893,\nL. Impression.\nFrom Mrs. Walker, 319, Hagley-road, Edgbaston, Birmingham.\nThe account was enclosed in a letter dated November 15th, 1893,\nbat Mrs. Walker tells us that it was written some time earlier.\nOn September 10th, 1892, 1 was walking by myself along a road near our\nhome, hastening to join my husband, to look over a new house which wo\nthought might suit us. My mind was completely absorbed in mental\nmeasurements and arrangement of rooms\u2014weighing questions of rent,\nexpenses, and sleeping accommodation, &c., &c., so that I scarcely noticed\nanything by the way. Suddenly the whole train of thought vanislied from\nmy mind, and was replaced by a mental picture of a little boy about 12,\nwhom formerly I used occasionally to notice about in our parish at various\nmeetings, but whom I [had] not seen for more than a year, and certainly (as\nfar as I could remember) had never thought of, or inquired about, since. I\ndid not know him well, but had merely spoken to him once or twice, as one\n\f^i&r,., 1894.] JuLu'nal of Society for Psychiccd Research. 213\namongst hundreds of our school children, though he had so far impressed me\nthat I should have described him as a rather original little fellow, and better\neducated than most.\nHowever, busy and preoccupied as I was that morning, Joey Fisher\nsuddenly, tvitliont tJie slightest cause or outside suggestion, obtruded himself\nupon my mind, so that I began to wonder what had become of the lad, as I\nhad neither seen nor heard anything of him for about a year. His face\nseemed to rise up before me, and the thought of him occupied my mind for\na minute or two. I was then passing along a road separated by a high hedge\nfrom the Rotton Park Reservoir, and can remember the very place where I\nbegan to think (jf the boy, and where, on coming in sight of the turn in the\nroad that led to the new house, my thoughts seemed to jump back to the\nabsorbing subject of interest with regard to the decision we had to make at\nonce about the house. I thought no more about it until, early in the even-\ning, a parcel containing a large pike was brought in to mo frum Joey\nFisher. I was still more surprised when, coming back from a parish\nmeeting later the same evening, I happened to meet the boy in the street,\nand learned that he had caught the pike himself that day in our Reservoir,\najid had been standing fishing down below the road at the exact time I had\npassed (but quite out of sight of the road). I asked, \" What made him think\nof sending it to me 1 \" He replied, \" I don't know ; it seemed to come into\nmy mind all at once, '\nI wonder if Mrs. Walker would like this fish V So I\nasked at home if I might take it you, and went up with it in the evening.\"\nAfterwards I thought it, at any rate, such a curious coincidence that I\nasked the boy to write it down, which he did, and I enclose his short\naccount.\nI may add that I had never imagined in any way either that he could fish\nor would be likely to be at the Reservoir. In fact, the boy had scarcely ever\nentered into my consciousness, until he suddenly that morning seemed\nto spring up before my mental vision, displacing an absorbing train of\nthought, just ichcH; unlniovjn to each other, we were very near together.\nJessie E. Walker.\nP. S.\u2014You will notice, the boy did not, apparently, think of sending the\nfish to me until he returned to the same spot in the afternoon ; so, although\nlie had come into mij mind when passing (unseen) in the morning, it was not\nfor some hours later that I seem to have occurred to him.\nThe account enclosed by Mrs. Fisher is as follows :\u2014\nI was fishing for pike at the Reservoir, Edgbaston, on Saturday, September\n10th. I caught one in the morning and before going home to dinner I threw\nin several lines, and when I returned in the afternoon I stood for a time on\nthe feeder bridge, watching the smaller fish, when I noticed an unusual fiutter\nin the water just about the spot where in the morning I had put in the lines ;\nI got my drag and was very surprised to find I had caught another pike. I\nwas very pleased and wondered what I sliould do with it, and suddenly I\nthought, how would Mrs. Walker like it. When I got home my sister made it\ninto a parcel and I took it to Mrs. Walker in the evening ; the same night\nI hfippened to meet Mrs. Walker in the Crescent ; she said she was very\n\f214 Journal of Society for Pnychical Research.

But there is one letter which\nI have not inserted to which I feel some reply to be due from myself\nrather than from Mr. Barkworth ; as the writer asks, in some indigna-\ntion, \"why\" Mr. Barkworth's \"letter has been inserted. Is the Society\nfor Psychical Research a scientific body formed for the purpose of in-\nvestigating psychical subjects, or is it a religious body, pledged to\nuphold \" certain dogmas ? . . . \"Of course any person belonging\nto the Society is at perfect liberty to hold what religious views he\npleases. I maintain, however, that he should not be at liberty to bring\nthem forward\"\u2014in ih% Journal of the S.P.R.\u2014\" as an argument for\nthe truth or falsehood of any matter under discussion.\" I have quoted\nthis protest, because I think that there is some justification for it, so\nfar as it is directed against myself rather than Mr. Barkworth. I\nthink that the arguments put forward by Mr. Barkworth in his\nremarks on \" Spirit Teachings \" are such as it was quite legitimate to\npresent for the consideration of those members of our Society who are\northodox Christians : although I agree with more than one of my\ncorrespondents in thinking that his own position is open to attack\nfrom an orthodox standpoint. But, on consideration, I admit that,\nconsidering the undenominational basis of our Society and its avowed\naims, the theological controversy to which such remarks as Mr. Bark-\nworth's inevitably lead should be rigidly excluded from the columns of\nthis Journal : and I hope to maintain such an exclusion in future.\n\fMae., 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 215\nA REPLY TO MR. BARKWORTH.\nTo the Edlloy of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir,\u2014It is satisfactory that Mr. Barkwortli should so energetically voice\nthe probably wide-spread feeling against the phenomena said to have occurred\nin the presence of Mr. Staiiiton Moses. I am a little surprised at the con-\ntempt he is able to pour on the contents of the \" automatic writings,\" since,\nperhaps because I know nothing of Theology, I myself thought them rather\nunexpectedly interesting ;\ncertainly more interesting than a \"discussion upon\ncurds and whey,\" which Mr. Barkworth would prefer in their stead. I am\naware, however, that it is useless to argue concerning matters of taste, and I\nam fully disposed to admit the probability of Mr. Barkworth's contention\nthat if Mr. Moses had adopted the procedure of ridiculing the communications,\nand had persisted in attributing them to a milkmaid, Miss Jones, then very\nlikely the writings would soon have attained the desired level.\nThis, however, might be expected on ojii\/ hypothesis, and would therefore\nprove nothing ;\nmoreover, I am rather glad that Mr. Moses did not adopt\nthis dogmatic procedure, because it would have been unscientific, and,\ntherefore, I venture to think, in this connection unwise.\nAn investigator who assumes to dictate to his phenomena is in rather a\ncurious position ; it might even be said that he was analogous to a person,\nsceptical as to, say, the Atlantic Telegraph, who, being taken to Valentia and\nshown a spot of light dancing aimlessly about, should at once frame the\nhypotheses\u2014(rt) that the spot only danced because the attendant shook it\n(6) that the communications from the ocean, if real, were of the most trivial\nand contemptible order (which in this case would indeed be painfully true) ;\nand on then being shown a cable leading to the sea, were peremptorily to\ndecline to investigate further unless permitted to chop the cable with a\nhatchet as a preliminary step.\nMr. Moses, howevcr,did none of these things, but allowed himself to be the\nalmost pavssivo recipient of whatever phenomena might either objectively or\nsubjectively occur. For this passivity the S. P. E. should be grateful to him ;\nbut further than that I do not presume to question the dicta of Mr.\nBarkworth concerning the theological and other high matters criticised by\nhim.\nThe only points upon which I feel at liberty authoritatively to disagree\nwith Mr. BarkAVorth are where in the course of his remarks he touches\noccasionally upon ordinary physics. He says that it is less than sane to\ncountenance the possibility of such contradictions of the laws of nature and\nof thought as the following :\n\u2014\n(1.) That the less can contain the greater.\n(2.) That two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time.\n(3.) That matter can pass through matter.\nI am not quite sure what he refers to as a pretended instance of the less\ncontaining the greater, nor what he quite definitely means by its strenuous\ndenial. In a sense it may be said that a great volume of gas is con-\ndensed in a few grains of gunpowder, and that until after the explosion the\nless contained the greater.\nThese glib phrases are unsafe weapons to use as arguments against asserted\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Ma-k., iso^-\nfacts. Either the asserted occurrence is a fact or it is not ;\nthe mere\nopposition of a phrase is ineflective.\nA somewhat similar objection applies to the statement that two bodies\ncannot occupy the sam.e space. The familiar instance of sugar dissolving\nin tea may be cited in opposition to the phrase, and the precise occurrence\nwhich Mr. Barkworth wishes to discountenance by the so-called axiom\nmust be separately treated and judged on its merits ;\nit cannot be denied on\nthe ground of vague and popular generalities.\nThirdly, what Mr. Barkworth regards as specially important, \"matter\ncannot pass through matter\" : evidence is superfluous and irrelevant, \"the\nthing is impossible, and there is an end of it.\"\nNow, whether it be surprising or not, it is nevertheless a fact that gases\ncan permeate solid matter, for instance, a slab of hot iron ;\nthey can enter at\none face and exude from the other, in large quantity and at a considerable\npace. And in the processes of osmosis it is familiar to chemists that some\nkinds of matter readily penetrate animal membranes, while other kinds do\nnot. Even the common process of tiltering may be regarded as a passage of\nmatter through matter.\nI presume, therefore, that what Mr. Barkworth intends to assort is that\nBolids do not pass through solids. Even that is of doubtful generality, for\na metal wire can pass through a solid block of ice leaving the ice just as intact\nas it was before. And in general, before such a statement can have any useful\nmeaning, Ave must define what we mean by \"solid,\" and what we mean by\n\"through.\" As before, Mr. Barkworth is attempting to encounter a\npossible fact with a well-sounding phrase ; and the contest is unequal.\nIt is no doubt contrary to the accepted facts of physics that a solid\nwork of art, such as, say, a crucifix of blue enamel, should be passed\nthrough the walls of a permanently closed box without detriment, and I am\nnot yet aware of proof that such an event has happened, otherwise than\nas it \"happens \" on conjurers' platforms ; but new properties of matter are\nalways interesting, if they can be well substantiated, and what the ultimately\npossible power of tlie human mind over matter may be, we cannot pretend\nto know except on experimental evidence.\nThe atoms of a solid are very far from being in contact, and dogmatic\nassertions as to impossil^ility of percolation are rash. Besides, even if known\nmolecular forces rendered it unlikely, the issue is not linally decided. Experi-\nmental evidence has given us a knowledge of three dimensions : it may con-\nceivably furnish us with some indications of four. The assertion that if such a\nthing as a crucifix were amenable to mental or spiritual influence, therefore\nmuch more important and hiteresting forms of matter, such as bank-notes,\ncould be equally well dealt with, does not strike me as forcible, because I can\nconceive the evidence to bo quite as bad for one class of objects as for the\nother.\nIt is, however, Very likely true (of this I am no j\nudge) that if a \u00a31,000 bank-\nnote could by any contrivance be thus passed through solid material, say,\nthrough the keyhole of a bank, the fact would create a profound sensation\nand be hailed by every newspaper as crucial and conclusive ;\nbut I would\nBucrgest that the glamour attaching to sacred possessions such as these might\n\fMae., 1804.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 217\nhave an undue mfluence and might even succeed in convincing the public\nmind prematurely or even falsely ; it would he wiser to maintain that the mere\nfact of the sacredness of an object ought not to be allowed to dispense with\nthe need for evidence concerning it quite as rigorous as would be desirable\nfor objects of a more intrinsically worthless kind.\nSimilarly, when seed-pearls or playing cards are said to be produced\nde novo, the complaint that they are not a more full-grown and valuable\nvariety does not strike me as a forcible destructive argument. Tracing them\nto a previous existence in somebody's pocket or carpet bag would be a much\nmore deadly form of retort.\nAnd the assertion that to suppose they can have been evolved out of the\n\"Ewigkeit\" is contrary to another \"axiomatic law,\" or 'A^ell-sounding\nphrase\u2014viz., \"\u00a3'xni\/ii^o}u7iiJyii,\" tends rather to prove too much; because, if\ntrue, it would be fatal to the existence of such pearls under any conditions\nwhatever.\nThe unfortunate character of Mr. Barkworth's physical objections deters\nme, I confess, from attaching as much weight as I should like to his theo-\nlogical arguments and his evident intuitions as to how these things really\nwould occur if they were genuine.\nMy scepticism with regard to these reported occurrences would lead me\nto sift the evidence for them very closely and critically if ever they occur\nwithin my ken. They have not, as yet, but if ever they do I trust it will not\noccur to me to brandish shorthand dogmatic statements as to what is and is\nnot possible, and refuse to listen to evidence for things, however unusual,\nwhich I have no sound a priori right to deny.\nMr. Barkworth's expressions of opinion will, I feel sure, be shared and\nsympathised with by a multitude of estimable persons- some of whom I\nknow and highly regard\u2014and, as I said at the beginning, I am glad he is\ngiving utterance to these highly natural and emotional objections. I reply\nto him only because, intermixed with higher criticism, he has stumbled over\na few physical platitudes in a manner which to tlie average man may sound\nvery commonsensible, but to a physicist is not satisfactory.\nI hope that the opposition to these strange assertions will yet take a more\nrigorous and formidable shape, so that both sides of the case may be fairly\nput before us before any even temporary decision is expected.\nOliver J. Lodge.\nAnother correspondent, Mr. Westlakc, travels over somewhat tlie\nsame ground as Professor Lodge. I am unable to insert his letter m\nfull, but give some extracts from it.\n\u2022\nCan it be necessary to repeat that the S. P. R. in printing Mr. Moses'\nExperiences is in no sense committed to, or to be understood as supporting,\nhis interpretation of them ? From its outset the Society has published\nexperiences from persons holding every shade of philosophical and religious\nopinion, the pertinent expression of which has always been allowed both as\na matter of courtesy and as lending a personal interest, but which is no\nconcern of the Society, whose sphere is limited to the consideration of the\nalleged facts. . . .\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar ,\n1894.\nI would protest against Mr. Barkworth's use of the word \" impossible,\"\nwhich should be restricted to logic and mathematics. In physics it is inad-\nmissible, in any other than a colloquial sense, since it assumes a complete grasp\nof the particular problem, that is, of the whole of nature. We can only speak\nof \" improbability,\" the degree of which varies for every person according to\nhis experience and knowledge of natural laws.\nI also submit that it is inadmissible to make \" thinkableness \" a criterion\nof fact, since this is to limit nature to our powers of imagination. Can, for\nexample, Mr. Barkworth, or anyone else, form the slightest idea of the means\nby which the influence of gravity is propagated, and with a velocity, as\nLaplace has shown, at least hfty million times greater than that of light?\nNo hypothesis has yet been elaborated by physicists which is consonant even\nwith the conservation of energy. . . .\nComing now to Mr. Barkworth's instances, it is, he says, \"contradictory\nto the axiomatic laws of nature and of thouglit that two bodies can occupy\nthe same space at the same time.\" Against this may be set the following of\nClerk Maxwell :\u2014\"That two bodies cannot co-exist in the same place is a\nvulgar opinion deduced from our experience of the behaviour of bodies of\nsensible size, but we have no experimental evidence that two atoms may not\nsometimes coincide. In water, for instance, we have no experimental\nevidence that the molecule of oxygen is not in the very same place with the\ntwo molecules of hydrogen.\" (Enc. Biit., article \"Atom.\")\nThe \"passage of matter through matter,\" so far from being impossible,\noccurs habitually in all the states of matter, excepting in the particular case\nof a solid passing through a solid. The non-occurrence of the latter rests\nsimply on experience. And as it is quite legitimate to assume, as is done\nby physicists in the case of Le Sage's theory, that the atoms of solids may be\nas relatively remote as are the planets of the solar system, the problem of\npassing one system through another witliout permanently distorting either,\ni.e., without a rupture of elasticity, is not i^rinui facie unthinkable. . . .\nSuch an improbable hypothesis, however, as the passage of one solid\nthrough another seems quite uncalled for by the bulk of the alleged\nphenomena. . . . The same power which transports the objects could,\nfor anything we know, as readily introduce them by unfastening a window\nor a door.\nRespecting Mr. Barkworth's proposition that a living man can probably\ndo everything that a disembodied spirit can, it seems to me that we do not\nknow enough to say on which side lyrohahility inclines, and that therefore the\nage-long belief in the extended powers of disembodied spirit is quite as likely\nto be true as any other. . . .\nAs to his second proposition, the possible proofs of post-m'>rtem survival\nare not necessarily confined to the verification of persistent memories ;\nper-\nsistence of mental faculties may be even more valuable. The alleged Sir\nRoger Tichborne was expected to show some knowledge of French, and the\nsame would be looked for from the deceased Sir Roger. With accomplished\ndecedents a high degree of probability might conceivably be reached, which\nin some special cases might almost amount to demonstration. Let us\nsuppose a control purporting to be Dolly Pentraeth or some such Cornish-\n\fMak., 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 219\nypcaking ijerson, thu last of whom died a century ago, and that a conversa-\ntion is carried on, consisting of questions to which the control replies in the\nalleged language, interpreting herself in English, and that the stenographed\nrecord proves to be genuine Cornish. The alternatives are either a Cornish-\nspeaking decedent or some incarnate who has learnt subliminally to speak\nCornisli from its recorded fragments. The latter, with all respect to the\nunconscious self, we might think improbable. The stenographed record might\neven decide the point by internal evidence, by either coinciding with the\nlimits of the literary records or by passing beyond them with probability in\nthe sense of agreeing with Celtic roots. I suggest the case in some detail\nbecause communications in dead unstudied languages have been alleged,\nand if sought for by spiritists up and down in the world might result ni\nfairly crucial instances. ...\nAs to the desirability of the S. P. R. publishing these things the following\nremarks of De Morgan's are applicable:\u2014\"! have said that the deluded\nspirit-rappers are on the right track : they have the spirit and melhud of the\ngrand time when those paths were cut through the uncleared forest in which\nit is now the daily routine to walk. What was that spirit It was the spirit\nof universal examination, wholly unchecked by the fear of being detected ni\nthe investigation of nonsense. Thus it was when the Royal Society was\nfounded Matters are now entirely changed. The great\nscientific bodies are far too well established to risk themselves. The\npasturers of flocks and herds and the hunters of wild beasts arc two very\ndifferent bodies, with very different policies.\" {Frum Matter to Spirit,\np. 19.) Let our Society beware how it endeavours to be both at once. Its\nincreasing growth, its very achievements, inevitably tend towards timid\nrespectability. May it never forget to which body it essentially belongs,\nnor shrink from the perils of the chase.\nE. Westlakf,.\nMK. STAINTON JIOSES AND MR. EARKWOKTII.\nTu the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir,\u2014The really interesting thing in the Strange Case of Mr. Stainton\nMoses is the question, \"How do such stories come to be told?\" From\nMr. Barkworth's letter in the Journal (Feb., 1894) I do not succeed in\ngathering exactly what Mr. Barkworth's opinion as to this question may be.\n(1) The Avitnesses allege that, in their belief, matter passed through matter.\nMr. Barkworth replies : \"The thing is impossible, and there is an end of it.\"\nIt is also \" unthinkable.\" Here be assertions. The process\u2014assertion for\nassertion\u2014 M \" thinkable \" by me. I can \"think \" it with perfect facility, if\nby \"thinking \" it is meant the process of conceiving the event imaginatively.\nNot being acquainted, as De Morgan was not, with the Nature of Things, I\ndo not know whether the passage of matter through matter is possible\nor not : nor, to be plain, does Mr. Barkworth. Holding his own\nviews, he says that the evidence of people who aver that they\nhave seen matter pass through matter has doubt cast on it by\nthat very averment : and that persons so niorally weak would be pre-\ndisposed to hallucinations of other kinds.\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mae., 1894.\nI am asking, why are these stories told ? Mr. Barkworth seems to think\nthey are told because Dr. and Mrs. and Mr. Charlton and Miss Speer, and\nMr. Percival, did not keep \"a firm hand on first principles,\" as, c.;\/., that\nmatter cannot pass through matter ; and again, were so morally vfeak as to\nbe capable of accepting suggestions which ended in collective hallucinations.\nSo far so good, if Mr. Barkworth really holds that collective hallucinations\ncan be produced by \" suggestion,\" or \" telepathy,\" in a group of persons who\nhave not, consciously, been hypnotised. 1 don't know if this is possible,\nbut if it can be done, experimental instances should be exhibited. Till a\nwell-selected assortment of collective hallucinations, produced by \" sugges-\ntion and telepathy,\" exerted on people who hive not consciously yielded\nto such influences, is brought forward, Mr Barkworth's theory seems\nattenuated. Mr. Percival, 1 am sure, knows as well as Mr. Barkworth that\nmatter cannot pass through matter. The precise extent of his \" moral\nweakness \" I am not prepared to discuss. Mr. Barkworth, apparently,\nholds that five or six people were feeble enough to bo all collectively hallu-\ncinated by the same hallucinations, et voila pourqwji voire Ji'Je est nwcttc.\nThat is why the stories are told.\nIt must be plain to tlie most excruciatingly feeble mind that Mr. Moses'\nfriends were not such fools as not to know that matter cannot pass through\nmatter. But they had only a choice between a material and a moral miracle.\nMatter did so pass, or their friend, the Rev. Stainton Moses, was deliberately\nand consciously swindling them.\nI am ready, nay, eager, to admit that an honourable man, if once he\nencourages a tendency to \" trances \" and \" somnambulism,\" may cheat un-\nwittingly. I am so convinced of this, that\u2014interested as I am historically,\nand as a question of human nature and human evidence, in these stories\u2014\n1\ngreatly wish that nobody would ever put himself or herself into the abnormal\nand unconscious, or semi-conscious, conditions of the seance. No good comes\nof it ; here I quite agree with Mr. Barkworth. It is a practice contrary, not\nonly to Holy Scripture, as he urges, but to good taste and moral prudence.\nWhy some people become \"entranced\" when they sit round a table one\ndoes not know. They do fall into this condition, however, and, in my\nopinion, it is a condition (when voluntarily sought for) unworthy of a wise\nman. \" Lead us not into temptation \" to forego our normal wits ! I am\nnot speaking of foregoing them under ansBsthetics for medical purposes, or\nfor scientifically conducted hypnotic experiment, but at \" seances.\"\nReturning from this moral digression, I repeat that Mr. Moses' friends\nhad their choice between a material and a moral miracle. Things came\nthrough stone walls, or their friend deliberately swindled them. A man\nwhen in an unconscious or non-normally conscious state may swindle un-\nwittingly. But, either matter came through matter, or Mr. Bloses,\nconsciously and deliberately, stuffed his pockets with enamel crosses,\nstones, scent-squirts, preparations of phosphorus, seed-pearls, and portable\npi-operty generally, \" the same with intent to deceive.\" His friends pre-\nferred the material to the moral miracle. Tliis choice may show scientific,\nbut scarcely \"moral,\" weakness on their part. Giving up, as undemonstrated,\nthe hypothesis that Mr. Percival and Mr. Charlton Speer were so morally\n\fMae ,\n1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 221\nweak as to be easily capable of identical collective hallucinations, we must\nturn to a vera causa. People can be, and often are, beguiled by jugglery.\nNow, it is possible that Mr. Moses for many years deliberately cheated his\nfriends. Scientifically speaking, we are driven to that conclusion, and that\nalone. The party was not all in the cheat : that would have been too dull\na way of passing the evenings. They believed in what they saw. The\nhypothesis of collective, frequent, and identical hallucination does not rest\non a vera causa. We do not know that such hallucinations can be produced\nin the circumstances : if they can, it is an interesting fact. Thus Ave must, if\nwo have a theory at all, suppose that Mr. Moses was a deliberate impostor.\nWhat was his motive for \" dres sing up to frighten Byng's aunt,\" every\nnif'ht He got very little by it, not money, not social success, not fame,\nonly notice from a small sect of spiritualists. But man will cheat for the mere\nfun of it ;\nhistory is full of examples. But Mr. Barkworth, who does not say\nin a straightforward manner, \" Moses was a swindler,\" admits that he be-\nlieved, to some extent, in his own marvels. He was \" driven liack \" by\nthem into theological heresies and moral imbecilities. If he believed in\nhis \" influences,\" could he be a cheat ? Yes, he could ;\nimpostors can, and\ndo, believe m their own supoxheries. Not being statesmen, or mediums,\nwe find it difficult to understand this fact in human nature, but (I speak of\nwhat I know), it isf a fact.\nI now give a fact which has escaped the acumen of Mr. Barkworth.\nIn Prooeedings, XXV., p. 349, Mr. Charlton Speer, in perfect good faith,\ntells the story which will be found in the place cited. Mr. Speer was sitting at\na table, his hand on a piece of paper. Mr. Moses, sitting opposite, said that\na very bright column of light was behind Mr. Speer. Doubtless that gentle-\nman loohed round. Later, Mr. Moses saw a \" spirit form,\" whose features\nhe did not recognise. After the seance, Mr. Speer found a message and a\nsignature on tlie paper (obviously written by Mr. Moses, some will say).\nThe name \"was that of a distinguished musician who died in the early\npart of the present century.\" Mr. Speer did not show Mr. Moses the writing,\nbut asked him if he could recognise the \" spirit \" in a set of photographs\nof friends and \" celebrities.\" Mr. Moses spotted the photograph of the dead\ncomposer who had written the message. Mr. Speer regards this as \"a very\nfair proof of spirit identity.\" Now see p. 32(i. There \" Grocyn \" said that\nMendelssohn \"would make Charlie\" (Mr. Speer) \"a great musician.\"\nGrocyn said this on September 7th, 1873, before Mr. Speer had been admitted\nto the circle. Thus Mr. Moses knew that Mendelssohn was interested in\n\"Charlie,\" long before he saw a \"great composer,\" a dead man, beside\n\"Charlie.\" (See also p. 327, Note 3.) W^as that composer Mendelssohn?\nWas Mr. Moses unfamiliar with the common photographs from portraits of\nMendelssohn 1\nAs to \" lights,\" compare Mr. Charlton Speer (last lines of p. 345) with\nMr. Moses (p. 322 and p. 32G). In Mr. Speer's experience \"they never\nthrew any radiance around them.\" According to Mr. Moses, one \"cast a\ngreat reflection on the oil-cloth.\"\nMr. Moses was a schoolmaster, and taught English literature. Yet\n(p. 305) he needed Mr. Noyes to tell him who John Lydgate was !\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., I804,\nI omit Dr. Speer's talk of \"Polonius\" and \" Dionysius \" in connection\nwith Grocyn ! His literary knowledge appears to have been scanty, or his\nmemory very unlike what we want in a good witness.\nEnfin, the hypothesis of frequent, collective, and identical hallucination\nis without basis in known facts. The hypothesis of collusion by the Speer\nfamily and Mr. Percival is absurd.\nThe hypothesis of \" unconscious \" cheating does not meet the case. The\ncheating must have been consciously prepared. There remain the hypotheses\n\u2014 (A) of an unknown agency, capable of making matter pass through matter\n(in which D.D. Home did not believe), and (B) the hypothesis that an upright,\nsober, and convinced gentleman, a good fellow, admired and loved (as I\nknow) by his pupils at Universii-y College School, was a motiveless impostor.\nIn favour of hypothesis (A) we have similar alleged facts\u2014\"spontaneous\"\n\u2014vouched for by a cloud of witnesses in all ages, including French mis-\nsionaries in Cochin China ; and in favour of hypothesis (B) we have examples\nof similar moral aberrations.\nPersonally, I can believe in neither of the hypotheses, neither that\nmatter came through matter, nor that Mr. Moses was a swindler. I give it\nup : it is not necessary to have an opinion. But, personally, I find the\nmoral miracle the easier, by a shade, to believe in, of the two. So far as to\nthe (j^uestion of evidence, which is the really interesting question. As to\nbelieving that the dead were at work\u2014the famous dead of long ago\u2014I do\nmost absolutely disbelieve that.

BAEKWORTIl's \" IMMUTABLE AND IMPREGNABLE LAWS.\"\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir, \u2014The admission of Mr. Barkworth's letter is virtually a request\nfor a reply.\nA catalogue of his really astonishing statements would be exceedingly\namusing reading : but space and time are precious, and I will only indicate\na few. He calls upon us to make a stand for \"the first principles of human\nreason \" and the \"axiomatic laws of nature and thought,\" and he backs this\nup by a solemn reference to \"the laws of matter\" as \"immutable and\nimpregnable laws.\" In a letter one cannot very well laugh, or I should have to\nask Mr. Bark worth to excuse me ; but he really is amusing. We all agree\nthat the laws of nature are \"immutable and impregnable\": the only\ntrouble is that the catalogue is still in the Editor's hands, and we do\nnot know what those laws are. No, there is anotlier trouble, \u2014that we\nare always being tempted to imagine we know.\nMr. Barkworth tells us that it is the height of unwisdom \" to embark upon\nexperiments of this kind without keeping a firm grasp upon first principles,\"\nand he frankly adnuts us into his show, when he says, \"The thing is im-\n\fMae., 1S04.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 223\npossible, and there is an end of it.\" How very interesting ! Then he falls\nupon poor Mr. Moses, who, \"instead of boldly dictating to the unseen\nagency the conditions under which it is to act, weakly suffered himself\nto be led.\" How very English I\n\" Britons never, never will be slaves !\n\"\nBut what answer comes from all the laboratories of the world, where\nthe seers of Science ask, that they may receive, and seek, that they may\nfind ? Why, the very tirst thing the seers of Science have to learn is to\nfind out under what conditions the unseen forces can act : and the second\nthing they have to learn is to steadily follow and obey. Fancy \" boldly\ndictating \" to the unseen forces and objects, and insisting that the analysis\nshall always yield to a pinch of pepper, or that the photograph shall be taken\nunder inspection at the town pump, or that the moons of Jupiter shall be\nseen through the kitchen poker !\nMr. Barkworth presents us with three specimens of his \" immutable and\nimpregnable laws.\" They are these : The loss cannot contain the greater :\ntwo bodies cannot occupy the same space at the same time : matter cannot\npass through matter. Such impregnable-looking assertions ; but honey-\ncombed with fallacy or mal-intention. Who was it that told us a comet could\nbe packed into a carpet bag ? What does Mr. Barkworth mean by\n\"space \" I Here is a cannon-ball : does it occupy all the space it seems to\noccupy 1 The object which seems to occupy all the space in which it stands\nis only a kind of sponge, in its way. Matter is always passing through\nmatter, as birds fly through the boughs of forest trees. It is all a question\nof degree, and of the meaning of the word '\n' through.\n\"\nMr. Barkworth's strong reference to Christianity being admitted\nmust not be passed over. \"The cardinal truths of Christianity\"\nare matters of opinion. They are no more amenable to dogmatism\nthan are Nature's \" immutable and impregnable \" laws. Profound modesty\nbecomes us here. We are told that Mr. Moses suii'ered himself to be driven\nfrom his \" orthodox moorings.\" Why not ? We are voyagers, not Greenwich\npensioners.\nPut into a nutshell, Mr. Bai'kworth's plea, from first to last, is pure\nobscurantism : \"We know all about it : the matter is closed : contradiction is\nimpossible : to be a seeker is to dictate your conditions and your dogmas :\nthe ideal philosopher is a limpet.\" It somehow seems a little out of date.\nJ. Page Hopps.\nON THE OBJECTIVITY OF APPARITIONS.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society fok Psy-chical Research.\nSir, \u2014A thought has struck me with regard to Mr. Myers' sulgective\ntheory of apparitions.\nI fancy his theory is that the hallucination (?), when veridical, may be often\ncaused by telepathy from some friend of the decedent, or by some deferred\nlatent impression in the mind of the percipient, the impressions in each case\nbeing assisted by some physical cause, such as tlie state of the atmosphere,\nor some subtle influences peculiar to the locality.\nAH this is to me far more wonderful than a purely objective apparition\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mab., 1894.\nwould be, but what I would like to ask Mr. Myers is this : How does his tele-\npathic theory cover the fact of apparitions being seen by animals\u2014dogs, cats,\nand horses\u2014 as they undoubtedly are ?\nSurely, this complex theory of telepathic and deferred latent impressions\nwould not apply to animals, since their cerebral development would hardly\nbo elaborate enough for these delicate influences, I presume. And if anything\nis proved, I should say it was the fact that apparitions are often seen by\nanimals, sometimes when wo can see nothing.\nFor a good example of this refer to the Jourrud S.P.Ii. for November,\n1888, Vol, III., p. 326, when a dog would not cross a certain room after dark,\nand once shrieked when the ghost was seen by a lady present. Surely, too,\nthe theory of suggestion, or dominant idea, or expectancy, would not apply to\nanimals in the matter of ghost seeing 1\nF.

Podmore read a paper on \" Ptecent Experiments in\nThought-transference at a Distance.\"\nHe began by pointing out the high value of evidence of this kind,\nboth as forming an intermediate link between the more striking spon-\ntaneous manifestations of telepathy at a distance, and the ordinary\nexperiments at close quarters ; and as being free from the more serious\ndefects of the latter kind of evidence, viz., the risk of unconscious\napprehension through normal channels. The difficulties in the way of\nexperiments at a distance were such as a little patience would readily\nsurmount : and the amount of success already achieved in this direction\nwas of good augury for the future.\nAfter briefly referring to the experiments in the induction of sleep\nat a distance, conducted by Professor Pierre Janet, Dr. Gibert,\nProfessor Richet, Dr. Hericourt, Dr. Dusart, Dr. Dufay and others,\naccoLints of which have appeai-ed in the Proceedings, Mr. Podmore\nread an account taken from the Annates des Sciences Psychiques (Sept.\n\u2014Oct,, 93) of a successful experiment in the induction of an attack\nof hysteria by Dr. Tolosa Latour, and one or two other accounts of\naction at a distance from the same periodical.\nPassing to experiments of a more usual type, he quoted some very\nsuccessful trials with playing cards, at a distance varying from 30 feet\nto some hundreds of yards, by M. J. Ch. Roux and M. Lemaire\n[Annates des Sciences Psycldques, 111., pp. 202-3), two experiments\nby Miss Campbell and Miss Despard, and one by M. L^on Hennique\n(Annates 111., pp. 114-6), all of which met with striking success.

Prickettj\nMr. Kirk being the agent.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then spoke on the subject of the Automatic\nWritings of Mr. Stainton Moses.\nA not unnatural objection, he said, had been taken in many\nquarters to the apparent grotesqueness and triviality of the physical\nphenomena experienced by Mr. Moses. It was felt that any alleged\nintercommunication between this world and another ought to show\nsomething more of seriousness and of moral purport. The speaker\ntherefore thought it desirable to point out at once\u2014what might more\nlogically have come at a later stage in the exposition\u2014that Mr. Moses'\n\" controls \"\u2014the alleged inspirers of his automatic script and utterance\n\u2014were above all things concerned with a course of moral and religious\ninstruction, much of which, indeed, Mr. Moses published in his lifetime\nunder the title of Spirit Teachings. In attempting to estimate the\nvalue of these teachings, it was in the first place plain that they ought\nnot to be taken alone, but in connection witii similar automatic utter-\nances given elsewhere, especially when those utterances seemed to have\nhad the guarantee (such as it was) of accompanying supeimormal\nphenomena.\nSuch writings, although often individually commonplace, acquired\nconsiderable significance v\/hen examined in the mass. It must, how-\never, be understood that any religious knowledge or emotion to which\nthey might seem to introduce us must be regarded as an addition to\nnatural rather than to revealed religion. Ptevealed religion might be\ndefined to consist of statements whose authors claimed a more than\nhuman authority;\u2014a knowledge of the universe such as ordinary human\nexperience could not supply. To such an authority, in the speaker's\nopinion, these automatic controls had no claim whatever. Even where\nthey signed their teaching with lofty names (and Mr. Moses' controls\nused lofty names, although never (:\/ii;ine names,) it would be rash indeed\nto attach importance to such assumptions. It was possible, however\u2014in\nthe speaker's opinion it was highly probable\u2014that some at least of the\ncommunicating influences proceeded from human beings who had\npassed through the change of death, and who therefore might be\ncredited with an extension of experience which might enable them to\nadd to our knowledge of the laws of the universe. If enough of such\nadditions were ever made, then oiatural religion\u2014representing man's\nmoral and emotional reaction to such obvious aspects of the universe\nas he has already comprehended\u2014might become something worthy of\nthe name of Scientific Eeligion ; representing man's moral and\n\fArEtL, 1894.] Joiirncd of Society for Psychical Research. 2^0\nemotional reaction to cosmic law discerned with sufficient definiteness\nto aiford a satisfactory guide to life.\nThe first step now open to us in such an inquiry consisted, in the\nspeaker's opinion, in a comparison of the general drift of automatic\nutterance with the moral or spiritual inferences which might seem\ndeducible from telepathy\u2014a law of communication of mind with mind\nwhich might concei^'ably hold good for the unseen world\u2014and which,\nif it did operate in that world, might probably operate there in a more\nconspicuous and unchecked fashion than in the material world, where\nmere traces of it, although unmistakable traces, had now been found.\nA freer play of telepathy suggested both a more complete trans-\nparency, and a more intimate union of souls. The first of these results\ninvolved a moral sanction of the most searching character, inasmuch\nas the completely informed judgment of all the beings who surrounded\nus might thus in an immaterial world be brought to bear upon our\nmost secret thoughts. The second inference\u2014the possibility of a\ncloseness of union impossible under corporeal conditions, might be\nlooked to as affording our deepest suggestion of the characteristic\nhappiness of a spiritual state of existence. Telepathy, indeed, might\nbe regarded as the scientific or objective expression of what was\nemotionally and subjectively felt as love. Mr. Moses' scheme of\nteaching, and the teachings of other accredited automatic messages,\nwere in harmony (the speaker urged), with this admittedly vague and\nuncertain development of natural religion,\u2014-to which a wide-reaching\nsubliminal drift\u2014whether or not depending on intelligences other\nthan those of incarnate men,\u2014at present seemed to tend.\nThere were, the speaker added, two other main subdivisions of the\ncontents of Mr. Moses' notebooks, \u2014besides the religious teachmg,\n\u2014\nwliich would have to be noticed in due time.\nThe second main ingredient consisted of evidence for the identity of\nalleged communicating spirits. The tldrd consisted of a record of private\nexperiences, in some ways intermediate between the physical manifes-\ntations of the seance-room and the purely intellectual forms of auto-\nmatism. It might be necessary to make a somewhat prolonged demand\non the Society's attention ; but it was only by persistent and often\ntedious study that, (as in the somewhat similar case of Mrs. Piper), the\ntrue meaning of these confusing phenomena might gradually be made\nknown.\nDk. Wallace said that an instance of telepathy had very recently\ncome under his notice. A lady patient of his, of Avhose clairvoyant\nexperiences information would, he hoped, be given to the Society, had\non several occasions seen hallucinatory figures standing behind him\n\u2014\nonce a figure of an old lady, with whom the name of his maternal\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

This occurred at about two minutes to eleven,\nand the name given in connection with the figure was that of another\npatient. The latter came to see laim the following morning and\ninformed him that her child was taken ill the night before, at about\neleven o'clock, when she had thought of sending for him, but had not\ndone so.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nG. 245. Collective. Apparition.\nThe following account was sent to Mr. Podmore, by Miss F.\nAtkinson, of 25, Aldershot-road, Willesden-lane, N.W., enclosed in a\nletter dated November 5th, 1893. Mr. Podmore had received a verbal\naccount of the incident from Miss Atkinson on the previous day.\nOn Saturday, July 1st, 1893, I was in L for the purpose of looking\nover the old churches with a friend with whom I was staying. Among\nothers we went to St. M 's. My friend had been telling me of a very\ndear old friend of the family who was buried in that churcli, and who had\nleft a sum of money to have a window put in to his memory, and had even\nhad the window prepared for the glass to be put in, but that the person who\nhad inherited his fortune neglected his wish. (I don't know how many\nyears he had been dead.)\nAfter we had looked over the church, and among other things seen the\nbrass over this gentleman's vault, wo came to the window which ought to\nhave been filled in. I remember that the neglect of his wish quite made\nme angry, and I said, looking at the window, \" If I was Dr. I should\ncome back and throw stones at it.\"\nJust then I saw an old gentleman behind us, but thinking he was look-\ning over the church took no notice. But my friend got very white and said\n\" Come away, there is Dr. !\n\" Not being a believer in apparitions, I\nsimply for the moment thought she was crazy, though I knew they were a\nghost-seeing famdy. But, when I moved, still looking at him, and the\nfigure before my very eyes vanished, I had to give in. Then it dawned upon\nme that nobody could have been looking'over the church but ourselves.\nFirst, the church had been empty when we went in, and nobody could\nhave come in without their footsteps being heard, and secondly, the part\nwhere we were standing ended in a \" cul de sac,\" and the person to get there\nwould have been obliged to ask us to move, as we entirely blocked up the\nnarrow aisle. For the few moments he was visible I saw Inm distinctly ;\nhe\nwas short and broad, and wore an old-fashioned tie, and a waistcoat cut low\nand showing a great deal of shirt-front. One hand was resting on a pew,\nand one down at his side holding his very tall hat. But the thing that struck\nme most was the sun shining on his white ban-, and maknig it\nlook like silver ; even now I can see him distinctly hi my mind's eye.

One of\nher sisters had so been aflected by it, that she will never sleep alone, or go\nupstairs alone. When we got home T easily recognised the Doctor by his\nphotograph. F. Atkinson.\nIn reply to Mr. Podmore's further inquiries, Miss Atkinson writes :\n\u2014\n25, Aldershot-road, Willesden-lanc, N.W. November dtli, 1893.\nI have not heard from Miss yet, but am writing to answer your\nquestions.\nNo. 1. I heard no noise whatever, not the digidest sound. But I had a\nfeeling that I cannot describe that somebody was behind us. So I turned\nround.\nNo. 2. As far as I can now remember we hotJi, turned at precisdy the\nsame moment. My friend naturally recognised him. I did not think anything\nof it, until I saw her face when I turned back again to look at the window.\nNo. 3. Long before we went into L ,\nmy friend told me they had\nbeen haunted to a dreadful extent at their old house. But beyond saying\nthat it was a man and an old friend of her mother's, [she] did not describe it,\nand I did not [pay any attention to it]\u2014knowing them to be a highly nervous,\nhysterical family. We otherwise never talked about it, as she can't bear the\nsubject. Afterwards she told me it was Dr. , the figure we saw in the\nchurch, who haunted them.\nNo. 4. The photograph was in a frame and Mrs. said :\n\u2014\"Was it\nanything like this '?\n\" And it was exactly like the figure. I forgot to tell you\nthat afterwards my friend told me that on going into the church she had felt\nas though she could not go in, as if something was there, but did not like to\nsay so to me, as she knew I very much wished to go over it. She also\nthought it might frighten me.\nMy only other experience was when I was a baby of about two or three,\nwhen my little brother, who died, came to my mother, and then to me :\nI don't remember it, but my mother says I cried out that he had come back\nagain, and she herself had just seen him.

My jDop-gun has drawn the fire of such heavy\nartillery as that of Professor Lodge and Mr. Andrew Lang ;\nand the Editor\nof Light has called me a window. O'Connell's fishwife was greatly exercised\nat being called a parallelogram, but merely to be called a window is not so\ndistressing. With my other critics, above-named, the case is different, and I\nscarcely know whether to feel flattered or annihilated. It would, however,\nbe scarcely respectful to them if I were to withhold any reply, and I must,\ntherefore, make the best fight I can.\nFirst, however, I must explain my position, which seems to have been\nsomewhat misunderstood\u2014doubtless through my own fault. It will be\nremembered that I began by saying that there were certain propositions\nwhich were axiomatic, and did not admit of argument, \"such are, &c.\" I\nthen (by way of illustration) (|uoted two well-known axioms. Any others\nwould have done e(iually well, but I chose these two because they had\na certain indirect reference to the matter in hand. To these I added another,\nmeaning to claim that it was of such a nature as to command acceptance on\nthe same grounds as the first two\u2014viz., that it was a self-evident proposition.\nThere, of course, I was prepared to be contradicted, or, at least, it did not\nsurprise me ; but I confess I did not expect to be called upon to vindicate the\nothers. To say that what is true in mathematics is false in physics is surely\na dangerous assertion that would require extraordinary reasons to support\n\fApril, 1804.] Journal of Bocidy for Psycldcal liesearah. 288\niL* I must reluctantly decline to accompany Professor Lodge in an excur-\nsion into a space of four dimensions, finding it quite a sufficient struggle to\nexist in one of three ;\nbut, with his leave, I will examine some of his scientific\nfacts in the light of the latter, and see whether they support the deductions\nhe desires, or others of a very difi'erent kind.\nA charge of gunpowder is smaller than the shell in which it is contained.\nWhen the charge is tired, the volume of gas generated is greater than its\nenvelope, and proves in the most demonstrative fashion that the less does\nnut contain the greater. But, says Dr. Lodge, the gunpowder potentially\ncontains the gas. This seems more like metaphysics than physics. An acorn,\nwhich may be planted in a flower pot, potentially contains an oak. Therefore\nI suppose the acorn is larger than the flower pot. And a pint of water\npotentially contains a volume of steam larger than can be contained in a\ncjuart kettle. Therefore the pint is larger than the quart. Which is absurd.\nAs to the argument from sugar and tea, I presume that the meaning is that\nthe fluid interpenetrates the molecules of sugar without adding to the cubical\ncontents of the latter. It would be equally true and conclusive to say that a\ncrowd of people can meet in a wood full of trees without increasing its area.\nBut what has this to do with two bodies in the same space ?\nThirdly, as to \" matter through matter \" : I doubt whether the argument\nfrom osmosis is admissible, because it is arguing from the organic to the\ninorganic. Shall we say that because vegetable matter can be converted into\nanimal tissue by assimilation, therefore the transmutation of metals is\npossible ?\n\" A metal wire can pass through a solid block of ice, leaving it intact.\"\nI can give another instance of this sort of thing, which it is just possible may\nbe new to Professor Lodge. There is a substance known as Woodite (after\nthe name of the inventor), which received the approval of SirE. Reed as an\nexternal covering for ironclad vessels. On a target so covered being pierced\nby a shell, the material was left apparently so intact that no water could have\nleaked through it. But if this is what Dr. Lodge means by matter passing\nthrough matter, it would be equally well displayed every time he passes\nthrough a -swing door in his house which closes behind him. I submit,\ntlierefore, that the scientific facts of Dr. Lodge, though indisputable, are\nirrelevant ; and neither disprove the axioms in question nor support the\nphenomena of Mr. Moses.\nFinally, Dr. Lodge urges that to deny that pearls can be produced ex\nnihilo would prove too much, since it would be fatal to their existence under\nany conditions. I have always been told that pearls were secreted by oysters.\nAre oysters, then, \" nihil \" ? If so, they are very dear at 3s. 6d. a dozen.\nAVbat can Dr. Lodge mean ? t\n*I once knew an eminent clergyman and Canon of the Chnfch, who Was asked\nby way of a riddle, \" What is tWo-thirds of three-fourths ? ''\nHe gave it up. When\ntold that it Was one-half, he pondered deeply, bnt at length said, \"Well, it may be\nmathematically trtie, but practically, it is unreliable.\" These distinctions are too\nsubtle for me, Truth is Onci\nt Is it possible that Dr. Lodge means to &tiggest that \" spirits \" might conceivably\nsecrete pearls? We shall be told they lay eggs next.\n\f234 Juufnal of I'Suclet}\/ for Psycldcal Research.. [Apuil, 1804.\nLet us now come to business. Dr. Lodge presumes that what I intend to\nassert is, that solids do not pass through soHds. Well, pretty much so. I\ncertainly did not mean to assert, as some of my critics seem to think, that\nwater could not run through a sieve. But I should prefer to lie still more\nprecise on this occasion, and say that bells and lozenge boxes do not pass\nthrough walls without making a hole in them. This I ventured to describe\nas unthinkable\u2014though perhaps it might have been more accurate to say\ninconceivable. Mr. Lang says he can think it with perfect facility. But has\nhe ever tliuuglit it out'-\nMy first objection is, that before a bell can pass through a wall it must be\nso transmuted (not in form\u2014that is nothing, but in essence) that it would no\nlonger be a bell. Let me explain. A bell could of course be melted down\non one side of a wall and be re-cast on the other. In that case it would retain\nits identity\u2014 in a sense. But then it would not be able to pass through the\nwall. And even if the process were to be carried a stage further and the\nmolten metal were to be vaporised, the case would be no better ;\nfor if the\nvapour of water will not pass through a solid substance, why should the\nvapour of metal % And, beyond vaporisation, what further degree of com-\nminution or disintegration can be thought possible or even imagined? It\nmight, however, pass if it were transmuted into an unknown gas or into some\nfiuid analogous to electricity, for which the wall could serve as a conductor.\nNow, what appears to me inconceivable is\u2014not that an object should be elec-\ntrified, but that it should be transubstantiated into electricity,* leaving\nnothing of its original constitution behind. And of course the reconstitution\nof the object presents a similar dilficulty to the understanding. In fact the\nbell Avould have to be itself, and at the same time something else, because\notherwise the supposed reconstitution would really be a new creation, which\nwould render any previous existence an unnecessary and superfluous con-\nsideration. This is what I tried to express by the word \"unthinkable.\"!\nIt is perhaps considerations such as these which have led another critic, Mr.\nMaitland, to propose a metaphysical solution of the difliculty. Ho would\ndiff'erentiatc between matter as phenomenon and as the thing in itself. I\nAvould refer him on this question to Kant's third chapter, on Phenomenon\nand Noumenon, adequate quotations from which would be too long for this\nletter. He will then, I think, see that his theory is not applicable in the\npresent case ; to which it may be added that all we know of concrete objects\nsuch as bells is phenomenal, and rests upon sensory evidence.\nMy second objection is that, according to the record, the bell was neither\ndematerialised nor disintegrated, nor anything else of the kind, but passed\n'''1\natn of course only Using electricity as a type of the unknown fluid supposed m\nthe case, and am not suggesting anything so preposterous as that a bell or a crucifix\ncould be metamorphosed into electricity.\ntThe limits of thought and supposition are, however, wide. There is a story of a\ncertain Yankee whose powers of imagination being challenged, said that he could sup-\npose himself swallowed by a bear, and that following this, nught come a crocodile\nintent on swallowhig both him and the bear ; and that, further, ho could suppose the\nextreme difficulty ho would fuel in deciding whether it was better to stay where he\nwas and take his chance with the hear, or sill' out and take his chance with the\ncrocodile.\n\fApeil, 189-1.] Journal of Society for Psychicat Research,.\nthrough the wall whole and unaltered as an ordinary, ringable, phenomenal\n\"\nbell. Here is the record (\" Experiences,\" p. 267). The whole paragraph\nshould be read, but for brevity I quote only the following.\n\" In the dining-room there was a little bell. We heard it commence to\nring, and could trace it by its sounds as it approached the door which\nseparated us from it. What was our astonishment when we found that m\nspite of the closed door the sound drew nearer to us. It was evidently\nwithin the room in which we sat, for the bell Avas carried round the room\nringing loudly the whole time. . . . It rang under my very nose,\" &c.\nNow I submit that a bell which can ring continuously must be possessed\nof a clapper, a rim, and of everything that goes to make up a \"common or\ngarden \" bell. We are therefore driven to consider the other hypothesis,\u2014\nthat the bell passed through the wall without change of any kind.\nAnd here I pause to ask, Can it be possible that a Fellow of the Royal\nSociety can, except as a joke, require proof that a bell cannot pass through a\nwall \"without detriment \" to the wall ? It would seem so, from the sentence\nout of which these words are quoted. For my part, if called upon for such\nproof, I should not know where to begin. I will therefore give the words of\na higher authority. The philosopher Locke, in his Essay on the Htmcm\nUiukrstandinfi (ch. 4, sects. 1, 2, and 3) says as follows :\n\"That which hinders the approach of two bodies when they are moved\none towards another, I call solidity. . . . This of al others seems the idea\nmost intimately connected with, and essential to body, so as nowhere else to\nbo found, or imagined, but only in matter. And though our senses take no\nnotice of it, but in masses of matter, of a bulk sufficient to cause a sensation\nin us ;\nyet the mind, having once got this idea from such grosser sensible\nbodies, traces it farther, and considers it, as well as figure, in the minutest\nparticle of matter that can exist; and finds it inseparably inherent in body,\nwherever or however modified. This is the idea which belongs to body,\nwhereby we conceive it to fill space. The idea of which filling of space is,\nthat where lue imcigine any space taken up by a solid substance, we conceive it\nso to possess it, thai it excludes all other solid substances : and will for ever\nhinder any two other bodies, that move towards one another in a straight\nline, from coming to touch one another, unless it removes from between\nthem in a line not parallel to that which they move in.\n\"\nThe first of the passages I have italicised may also be set off against Mr.\nWestlake's quotation from Professor Clerk Maxwell.*\nIf Professor Lodge will not allow me to assert without proof that a solid\nobject cannot pass through a wall without making a hole in it, I may expect\nto be called \" dogmatic \" for asserting that the earth is not fiat, or that\npigeons' eggs do not grow on trees. Indeed, certainty as an attitude of the\nmind must be abandoned in despair.\n* I have only had opportunity for a hufried glanee at the article in the Enc. Brit,\nreferred to, but it seemed to me that the author was only stating one out of several\npossible opinions on the subject. Further on he writes, \" The atom has nbt the\nso-called property of impenetrability, fur two atoms may exist in the same place.\nThis we may regard as oite cxlrcme of the various opinions about the constitution of\nmatter.\" The italics are mine.\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1894.\nI now pass to the second division of the subject, viz., those alleged facts\nwhich I did not unconditionally deny, but which I attributed to the action of\nsuggestion, &c., instead of to spirits.\nOn this point Dr. Lodge makes use of an illustration taken from the\nA^tlantic cable, the application of which I do not fully detect. All that strikes\nme upon it is, that if it were noticed that the spot danced whenever the\nattendant shook it, and that after the cable was cut it continued to dance all\nthe same, it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that the phenomenon\nwas due to the shaking and not to any communication from beyond the\nocean. Dr. Lodge is opposed to the notion of dictating to phenomena, which\nhe attributes to me. In this he has, I think, misconceived my meaning, or\nelse lias overlooked the important distinction between investigations into the\noperation of \" suggestions \" and almost any other inquiry. How are sugges-\ntions to be tested except by giving them ? And how, in that case, are they\nto be given except by dictating them ? I do not propose to dictate to\nphenomena, but to the passive consciousness of the medium, which, I contend,\nproduces the phenomena. If the latter then answer to the suggestions so\ngiven, my theory is confii-med. The subject under immediate consideration\nis more jjarticularly automatic writing, and has it not been constantly\nobserved that the character of the writing corresponds to the suggestions,\nconscious or unconscious, of the writer ? Thus, to those who approach the\nexperiment in fear of diabolic influence, the unknown one claims to be Satan,\nand those who are expecting answers from known decedents get correspond-\ning replies. This of course is only a bare sketch of my meaning, which would\nhave to be considerably filled in to accord with particular cases. What I am\nconcerned to show is, that the phenomena should not be left to take care of\nthemselves. In this connection I will propose an analogy which seems to me\ncloser than that of the Atlantic cable. I suggest, then, that if the views of\nDr. Lodge were carried out in regard to, say, a delicate experiment\nin chemistry, he would avoid \"boldly dictating\" to his assistant the\nmaterials or cj^uantitics to be employed, and would take from the shelves of\nhis laboratory whatever came first, Avould pour them promiscuously into a\nretort, and would then sit down and \"allow himself to be the almost passive\nrecipient of whatever phenomena might . . . occur.\" (The words are his\nown.) In such a case the result would probably be that which actually occurred\nin one of the Moses stances, viz., a \" coarse and pungent scent,\" by which,\nhowever, the cause of science would not be advanced.\nWhen Dr. Lodge confesses that if Mr. Moses had persisted in\nattributing the communications to a milkmaid they would soon have attained\nthe desired level, he virtually gives away the whole spiritist case ; for this\ninvolves the admission that the new suggestion would have overcome the\nold one (of spiritist agency), and have proved that such suggestions, and their\nGonsequent effects, can be varied at will. Surely that is proof enough that\nthe effects are duo to the suggestions, and not to extraneous agencies.\nWith regard to the banknote and the seed pearls, Dr. Lodge has missed\nthe main point of my argument, which I should have thought was too obvious\nto need insistence. A \u00a31,000 note would have been of extreme value as a\ntest, not only because of the uotoricty which its disappearance would have\n\fApril, 1894,] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 237\nobtained, but because such things are safeguarded with such exceptional care\nthat their abstraction would possess an evidential value quite beyond what\nattaches to mere trifles. Similarly \"ropes of pearls \" found in the keeping\nof a man not remarkably wealthy, and not claimed by anyone else, would\npossess an evidential value far above that of seed pearls which could have\nbeen easily procured for a few shillings. Professor Lodge seems to have\npenned these remarks without much reflection.* On the other hand, tracing\nthese objects to somebody's pocket would have been no use whatever, for the\nsame thing has been done over and over again, without the cause of spiritism\nbeing the least weakened in the minds of its dupes.\nTurninf once more to Mr. Westlake, and his assertion that I can form no\nidea of the velocity with which gravity is propagated, he has here overlooked\nthe distinction between real and notional assent, as expounded by Newman.\nI can give a notional assent to such velocity without being able to com-\nprehend it as a concrete mental image ; but to the proposition that a bell\ncan pass through a brick wall without making a hole in it, I am mentally\nincapable of giving any assent, real or notional. It is more than miraculous\nIt is unthinkable.\nIf Mr. Westlake will do me the honour to read again the second of my\ntwo propositions to which he refers, he will see that what he has said upon\nthe relative value of difterent kinds of evidence is in no way opposed to my\nproposition ; on the contrary, I have often urged the same view myself.\nThere is nothing in Mr. Hopps' letter which need be replied to.\nThomas Barkworth.\n[A letter received from Mr. Charlton T.

W. H. Myers made the following statement :\n\u2014\nI have the pleasure of informing the Society of an event which is\nlikely to be of great advantage to the cause of Psychical Research.\nA new Society, of an international character, called the Psychological\n\fMay, .1894.] Journal of Society for PsijcUcal Research. 243\nSociety, or Societe de Psychologie, has been founded in France and\nEngland, with objects very similar to those of our own Society. Of\ncourse, the mere multiplication of Societies is in itself no gain, but\nrather a waste of power ; but in this case there has been a special reason\nfor tlie new foundation. The Countess of Caithness, who is also by her\nfirst marriage Duchesse de Pomar, has long been interested in Spiritu-\nalism and kindred inquiries. Her only child, the Due de Pomar,\nwho is unmarried, shares these interests. They are both of them\ndesirous that in the event of the Due de Pomar's continued celibacy,\nthe large property which Lady Caithness inherited from her father\nshould be devoted to the furtherance of psychical inquiry and instruc-\ntion ; and they have united in bequeathing that property to the newly-\nformed Society. The testaments are, of course, subject to revocation\n;\nbut assuming that they remain unaltered, a very ample endow-\nment will accrue to our studies on the demise of the testators. It is\nthe natural desire of Lady Caithness that France, where she resides,\nand where the important mansion which forms part of the bequest is\nsituated, should share in the advantages thus accruing. After much\nconsideration it was decided that the best way of effecting that end\nwas to place the new Society under a Board of Directors-themselves,\nof course, precluded from deriving any pecuniary benefit from the\nbequest\u2014half of whom should be French and half English. The\nPresidency of this Board was oflfered to Mr. Crookes ;\nbut while consent-\nin- to be a member of the Board, he did not wish to give the time\nneeded for the main direction of its work. Professor Richet was\ntherefore unanimously elected President, and the Vice-Presidency was\nconferred upon myself, in order to indicate the close harmony intended\nto prevail between this new Society and our own.\nAssociates can now be elected, and will pay ten francs, or eight\nshillings, yearly. In France a good many Associates have already\nenrolled' themselves, and I shall be very glad if, say, some forty or\nfifty En^dish Associates will now join. There is naturally less\nobvious reason for joining the Psychological Society in England than\nthere is in France, as we are already doing so much the same work.\nBut I think that it is important to maintain from the beginning the\nthoroughly international character of the new Society, in view of the\n<^reat p\u00b0ower of development which its proposed endowment may confer\nupon it in the future. And there will, I think, be enough of difference\nin the aims and activities of the two groups to make this new inter-\nnational group specially attractive to at least one section of our own\nmembers. On the- one hand, the very raison d'etre of the S.P.B. is\nthe inclusion of persons at every possible point of view who agree\nonly in desiring to apply a scientific treatment to all the psycho-\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1894.\nlogical problems whose study they undertake. Amongst us, therefore,\nare many who are interested in telepathy or in automatism, but\nwho are less interested in Spiritist inquiries. In the new Society,\nwhile the scientific aim and treatment will be in every respect, I\nhope, as carefully maintained as in our own, \u2014and so long as Professor\nRichet is its President, his name is a guarantee for this \u2014there will, I\nthink, be a larger proportion of effort and inquiry directed to Spiritistic\nproblems. Professor Richet proposes, for instance, to make a critical\ncollection of alleged spirit-photographs, of which a duplicate copy might\nperhaps be placed in England, if our English subscriptions sufficed to\nmeet the expense. Professor Richet has also held many sittings of\nlate with Eusapia Paladino, with results of which I hope we may be\nable to give later on a detailed account, and the question of inviting her\nto England is one which the new Society might naturally entertain.\nI therefore invite adhesions to the Psychological Society. For the\npresent, applications may be sent to me at Cambridge. I will\nask correspondents not to expect an immediate reply. When an\nelection is held, they shall be informed ; and it is understood that the\nfact that a candidate already belongs to the S.P.R. is a sufificieut\nqualification for election to the new Society.\nMr. W. CpvOOKes, F.R.S., said that he attached great importance to\nthe new Society, and trusted that it would be warmly supported\non this side of the Channel. Opportunities of exact and definite\ninquiry into the so-called \"Phenomena of Spiritualism\" not un-\nfrequently occurred ; but such inquiry needed funds, which he hoped\nthe Psychological Society might be able to supply. He trusted that\nthe link between the elder and younger Societies would be a very\nclose one, although it had not seemed desirable to attempt an absolute\nidentity.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then gave an address on \" Retrocognition,\" of\nwhich the following is a brief summary :\n\u2014\n\" In 1888, Mrs. Sidgwick published in our Proceedings a paper on\nPremonitions, in which, while pointing out the relative scantiness of\nthe evidence thus far collected for any knowledge of the future,\nshe urged the importance of keeping a look-out for fresh cases. In\nthe six years which have since elapsed, the evidence has more than\ndoubled in quantity, and has in some ways improved in quality\n;\nespecially by the substitution (so to call it) in some few instances of\ncrystal-visions, which are a form of experiments in hallucination, for\ndreams, which are one of the least satisfactory forms of spontaneous\nevidence. It continues to be extremely desirable that crystal-vision\nshould be more widely practised, and the results, when there are any,\nrecorded carefully and at once. If for premonitory dreams we could\n\fMay, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 245\nmore f^enerally substitute these premonitory pictures, we might give at\nonce a frequency and a definiteness to the proofs of precognition which\nthey can hardly otherAvise obtain.\n\" Moreover, we have now reached a point in our study of the Sub-\nliminal Self at which it seems needful to discuss in a somewhat broader\nmanner the relation of subliminal cognition to time, both to time past\nand to time future. For the present, T speak only of its relation to\ntime i)ast,\u2014 oi the various ways, normal and supernormal, by which\nwe can summon into our own active consciousness the events of the\npast. These ways are ordinary memory, subliminal memory, and\ntelepathy, from living men or from unembodied spirits.\n[Examples given of these various classes.]\n\"It has also been claimed that some j;erso?i\u00abZ trace attaches to\norganic matter, or to objects kept near an organism ; and that some\nimjyersonal trace attaches to inorganic matter. Much more experiment\nis needed on these points. Finally, in some cases it seems as though\npictures were presented to the percipient from some ' cosmic picture-\ngallery,' or record, perhaps in a larger mind than the individual man's,\nof the past of the universe. All these retrocognitive experiences must\nbe considered in connection with the precognitive cases, with which I\nhope to deal in a later paper. In the meantime, further experiments\nor records of spontaneous incidents will be very welcome.\"\nMr. T. Barkworth said that mediums being persons confessedly\nendowed with extraordinary receptive powers, it was necessary, in\nestimating the results they obtain, to keep in view not only the\npossibilities of their own conscious or unconscious memories, but also\nthose of all the other partners in the seance. As regards so-called\npsychometry, it was surely a simpler explanation to suppose thought-\ntransference from the mind of the possessor of the object presented to\nthe clairvoyant, than any mystical properties in the inanimate object\nitself.\nMr. Edward Maitland expressed great satisfaction at the\nadvance indicated in Mr. Myers' address. For it meant that the\nSociety for Psychical Research was at length finding its Psyche. The\nwhole of the work in which he had collaborated with the late Dr.\nAnna Kingsford was a demonstration of the permanence of the human\nEgo, as shown by its power to recover in a later incarnation the\nrecollection of experiences undergone and knowledge acquired in\nprevious incarnations. It was by this means that they had been\nenabled to recover the long lost Gnosis, which underlay all the world's\nsacred scriptures and religions, and which solved all the mysteries of\nexistence. And on seeking the source and method of the revelation,\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1894.\nMrs. Xingsforcl received, in response to a mental request made by\nhimself of which she was unaware, an instruction concerning inspira-\ntion and prophesying, in which it was said :\n\" None is a prophet save\nhe who knoweth : the instructor of the people is a man of many lives.\nInborn knowledge and the perception of things, these are the sources\nof revelation.\" Matter, then, is not the substance of existence and basis\nof evolution. Matter is phenomenon. The substance of existence is\ndivine, \u2014is divinity ; And the soul, as an individual portion of that\nsubstance, is possessed of divine potentialities. \"Wherefore, as the\nmanifestation of a divine inherency, evolution is accomplished only by\nthe realisation of divinity, the process whereof is called Regeneration,\nand, being very long, necessitates Reincarnation. For it consists in the\nelaboi^ation of a spiritual and substantial self-hood within the material\nand phenomenal self-hood, as its matrix. This is what was called by\nAristotle the EnteJerlieia, and by St. Paul, the \"Clirist within.\" Such\nis the doctrine of Scriptui-e and of Reason, and of which the Christ is\nthe personal demonstration. And in such measure as the Psyche is\nfound, it is confirmed by experience.\nThe Rev. J. Page Hopps asked for a definition of the sense in\nwhich the word \" hallucination ''\nwas used by the Society : as their use\nseemed to him to divei-ge from the ordinary acceptation, which implied\nsomething deceptive or delusive.\nMr. Myers replied that Mr. Gurney had defined hallucinations as\n\" Percepts which lack, but which can only by distinct reflection be\nrecognised as lacking, the objective basis which they suggest,\"\u2014this\ndefinition marking them off on the one hand from true perceptions, and\non the other from remembered images or mental pictures. Some\nhallucinations were wliolly delusive ;\nsome, on the other hand, were\ncoincident with some actual fact which they indicated. But the\nelement common to all of them was lack of correspondence with\nimmediately present material reality ; so it seemed best to keep the\nword hallucination for all cases, but to distinguish as veridical those\nhallucinations which did in some way convey actual fact. The speaker\nadded that he saw a lady present who could, if she would, give the\nmeeting some interesting examples of the apparent retracing of the\nhistory of inanimate objects.\nMiss X., responding to this invitation, said, that having accident-\nally discovered that she had some faculty of cognition of the kind\ncalled, for want of a better name, \" psychometric,\" she had experi-\nmented carefully in this direction, but only to find that impressions\nwere far more veridical when spontaneous than when sought for by\nexperiment.

She quoted three experiences, illustrating (1) what seemed\nto her a clear case of thought-transference, (2) an instance in which\nthe theory of thought-transference would need to be considerably\nstretched to meet the case, and in which the hypothesis of clairvoy-\nance might conceivably be suggested, and (3) an instance in which it\nseemed that the thought-transference, if such there were, must have\nreached some sub-conscious stratum of her intelligence.\nIn the lirst case, she had seen a picture of tire (which struck her\nas being of volcanic, or other, not ordinary, origin) followed by one\nof sea-waves. This occurred on the handling of a stone, known by\nthe person who gave it into her hands to be from the shores of the\nDead Sea. In the second case, she had a vision apparently of the\nJews' Wailing Place, on handling a stone which had actually come\nfrom that spot though at the moment erroneously supposed by the\nperson handing it to her to have come from Rome. The third case\nhad interested her as perhaps suggestive of the method of this sort\nof impression.

The papers were, as a matter of fact, picked up, on the\nmorrow of the battle, on the field of Sedan.\nMiss X. added that she did not feel herself in a position to theo-\nrise on the subject, but hoped that the narrative of some practical\nexperiments might serve as incentive to others to try their own powers\nin the same direction.\nMr. Veitch gave some account of his own \"psychometric\"\nexperiences, which had some analogy with those related by Miss X.\nTHE COMMITTEE FOR THE SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGA-\nTION OF HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA.\nThis Committee has continued to meet with regularity on Tuesday\nevenings, at the rooms of the Society, during the winter months.\nIts efforts have been mainly directed towards obtaining thought-\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. {May, 1894.\ntransference from the hypnotiser to his subject, effecting alterations\nby verbal suggestions in the pulse of a hypnotised subject, and the\ndevelopment of sub-conscious reckoning.\nThe supply of subjects has not been as extensive as the Committee\ncould desire, and up to the present, their experiments have been con-\nfined to nine persons, of whom five were paid subjects. As to success\nin the series of experiments first indicated, the Committee cannot yet\nspeak with any assurance. Their experiments, which have been\nnumerous and conducted with all care, have usually taken this form.\nTen pieces of paper, on which were written numerals from 0 to 9\nrespectively, were prepared. Of these, one was drawn at haphazard\nby a member of the Committee and was handed to the operator, who,\nconcentrating his attention thereon, endeavoured to transfer the idea\nof its value to the subject. As a rule the ratio of successes to failures\ndid not reach the average (one in ten trials) that might have been\nproduced by chance, save in a particular series of experiments carried\nout with a paid subject, at a meeting on November 28+^11, which\nexperiments have already been referred to in the Journal for February\nlast. In all cases agent and percipient were in the same room,\nthough no contact existed between them.\nIn respect to alterations effected l)y suggestion, during hypnosis, in\nthe force and rapidity of the heart's action, much interesting evidence\nhas been collected. In all cases sphygmographic tracings of the radial\npulse have been taken, simultaneously with the counting of the pulse\nby another observer : the subject throughout sitting quietly in his\nchair at the table with his arm outstretched and resting thereon, to\nfacilitate the taking of tracings. As being fairly typical of these\nexperiments, the following may be recorded, which was carried out\nwith a paid subject on February 27th, last. The pulse before hypnosis,\nand in the alienee of any suggestion, was 72 per minute. During,\nhypnosis he was told that he was engaged in an exciting dancing com-\npetition, and that his heart was beating furiously. The tracing was\ntaken after such suggestion had been continued for two minutes,\nand it showed marked increase in both tidal and dicrotic waves,\nwhile the pulse rate had risen to 102 per minute. Quieting\nsuggestion was then employed, until the heart's action had calmed\ndown, as it speedily did, and then the subject Avas depressed by\ngloomy thoughts of debt, misfortune and hunger, suggested by the\noperator. The pulse then fell to 62 per minute, while the diminished\nupstroke and the complete absence of secondary waves are most\nmarked features in the tracing taken at the time of counting the pulse.\nHitherto the effort to modify the heart's action by verbal suggestion\nconfined only to the pulse itself has not met with success, and\n\fMay, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 249\nto produce any evident change it has been necessary to supplement\nthis with further suggestions of a more or less dramatic character.\nIn regard to sub-conscious reckoning, a certain amount of interest-\ning evidence has been collected.

He was then told that immediately on awakening he would at\nonce read aloud continuously from a journal placed before him, and\nwould at the same time write down with a pencil, placed between the\nfingers of his right hand, the number of times a certain letter selected\nby the Committee occurred in the verse.

I enclose her card.\nIn February last, her mother, living in N. H., died suddenly one night\nbetween nine and ten, of lieart-disease. Her last words to a daughter-\nin-law present were : \"Don't cry, don't feel badly, you have done everything\nyou could for me.\"\nThat same night, Miss was here at the Brunswick, the guest of the\n, and they were out at some entertainment in the evening. They\nreturned, and Miss retired about eleven and immediately had a\nvivid dream that her mother came to her, embraced her fervently, and said :\n\" Don't cry, don't feel badly, you have done everything you could for me.\"\nThe impi-ession was so vivid\u2014she felt the touch\u2014heard the tones\u2014that she\nslept little, and the next nKjrning told Mrs. that she must go and visit\nher mother\u2014that she was sure she was ill and wanted her, and almost while\nthey were talking of it, the telegram announcing her mother's death came.\nWhen Miss reached the place, she told her sister-in-law the words of\nthe dream before the sister-in-law had told her what their mother actually\nsaid, and the lady who was present with the dying woman was startled at\nthe coincidence of the actual last words of the dream.\nMiss will reply to any question if you wish.\nLilian Whiting.\nSome time later, Dr. Hodgson obtained an account of the incident\nfrom the percipient herself, who writes as follows :\n\u2014\nMarch 30th, 1892.\nDear Sir,\u2014Your letter dated March 25th, has just reached me, and I\nhasten to say that this is the first communication that I have received from\nyou. Miss Whiting's account of my dream must in some way have been lost\nin the mail. I have no doubt but that it was quite accurate. However, to\navoid giving you more trouble, I will just write it out briefly. I was visiting\nfriends fifty miles away from my mother's home. I had not seen her for\nsome weeks, and I did not know that she had been having attacks of a heart\ntrouble, which caused her death. She had always been strong and well, with\nthe exception of rlieumatism, and the thought of her dying had never\nentered my mind. I retired at eleven o'clock, and fell asleep immediately,\nand as soon as I slept, my mother came to me in a. dream ;\nshe was dressed\nin black and looked very young. She put her arms around me and said :\n\"Do not cry, you have done everything that you could for nie.\" This she\nrepeated several times ; then I awoke, disturbed and troubled, with tears on\nmy face.\nIn the morning I told my friends that I was troubled about my mother\nbecause of a vivid dream. In two hours the telegram came, saying that she\nwas dead. I went immediately, and before I was told anything about the\nmanner of her death, I told my dream. My sister-in-law said: \"Why\nthose were mother's dying words.\" She was taken ill at nine o'clock in the\nevening, and died at ten. She looked at my sister and said :\n\" Do not cry,\n\fMay, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 251\nyou have done everything that you could for luc, but I am dying,\" and with\nthese words she was gone.\nIf I had dreamed this after I knew that slie was dead, I should not\nhave been surprised, but as it is, it seems to me wonderful, and I can but\nfeel that she was permitted to come, in order to prepare lue a little for the\nshock.\nThe following corroborative notes from Miss 's sister-in-law\nand the friend with whom she was staying at the time of her mother's\ndeath were afterwards received.\nMarch 2mh, 1893.\nThe account that my sister, Miss ,\ngave of mother's dying words, and\nthose which mother spoke to her in her dream as being the same is (juite\ncorrect.

BARKWORTH AND \"THE UNTHINKABLE.\"\n{To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir,\u2014Perhaps the simplest and most useful form of reply to Mr. Bark-\nworth's friendly remonstrance in the April number is to indicate chiefly our\npoints of agreement. The vivacity of his attack has secured him many\nanswers, and his ability enables him to make an ingenious defence of his\nposition, but despite its bulwarks of common sense the groundwork of\ngnosticism on which it is based suthces, as I think, to render it untenable.\nIt would be a strong position oidy if we could be sure that its occupants\nknew a great deal about the universe, but, to those of us who are conscious\nabove all things of ignorance, any fortification based on assured dogmatism\nis apt to appear inherently feeble.\nBy \"dogmatism \" or \" gnosticism \" I mean nothing offensive ;\nI mean\nsimply the attitude which is ready to encounter individual phenomena with\ngeneral propositions, the attitude which either upholds or denies asserted\nevents on the grounds of the iitness of things, or the laws of Nature, or\ngeneral axioms, or revealed truth.\nThere were things in my former letter, about bank-notes for instance,\nwhich were \" wrote sarkastical,\" but there shall be nothing but seriousness\nin this. I admit that the so-called value (really rar it ij) of an \" apport\n\"\nmight in some cases add to the prima facie strength of evidence concerning\nit ;\nas, for instance, if a chemist, asserting that he could make diamonds,\nwere to produce one of the size of a cocoanut ; but in a general way the\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1894.\nbank-note form of argument strikes me as not only irritating but feeble, and\nin no case ought the fact that a chemist did not produce cocoanut diamonds,\nnor anything bigger than a loin's head, to cause us to shut our ears to the\naccount of his process, and keep them shut until we are satisfied with the\nsize of his result.\nOn another point also I am able to agree with, or even go beyond, Mr.\nBarkworth ;\nfor, whereas he considers it \" dangerous\" to say \"that what is\ntrue in mathematics is false in physics,\" I myself should regard such an\nassertion as merely self-contradictory and absurd. This acquiescence\nperhaps relieves me from further following up certain illustrations on which\nit is not likely that sane people really disagree. So we come at once to the\nroot of the matter under discussion.\nThe quotation made on p. 235 from \" The Experiences of Mr. Stainton\nMoses\" goes to show, (1) that to the persons present in a certain room sounds\noccurred as if a bell originally outside the room had entered the room. (So\nfar I am disposed to accept the record absolutely.) (2) That when light was\nrestored a bell was found on the table. (This also is most probably true,\nbut it requires more careful witness than a statement concerning sounds,\nbecause, after the sounds, the presence of an actual bell would be liable\nto bo inferred in subsequent memory, perhaps without sufficiently cautious\ncontemporary scrutiny.) (3) That the sitters believed the bell to have been in\nanother room immediately before the sitting. (I fully accept the belief, but\nconcerning the actual physical fact it is necessary to be more cautious, for it\nis peculiarly difficult to secure detinite evidence concerning the previous\nlocality of an object not previously decided upon for experiment.) (4) That\nthe sitters felt assured that the door of their room was not opened during\nthe entry of the bell, because the hall outside was brightly illuminated by\ngas.\nNow sujjpose, for the sake of argument, that the evidence was thoroughly\ngood for the objective presence of a bell (\u00ab) outside the room initially, and\n{h) inside the room finally, together with (c) a guarantee of some kind\n(not easily obtained) that it was the same bell, and not a mere conjuring\nsubstitution ;\nsuppose in other words that the event occurred among serious\ninvestigators, as events occur in a laboratory : what is to be our attitude ?\nIt is here that I find myself differing from Mr. Barkworth. Scepticism\nis necessary and entirely legitimate ;\nproof of such an occurrence must be\nof the strongest if it is to carry conviction ; but Mr. Barkworth s attitude\nI venture to think is rather dogmatic than truly sceptical. Instead of\nbecoming critical he becomes ejaculatory :\u2014impossible, preposterous, more\nthan miraculous, unthinkable, and so on. But, as Mr. Andrew Lang says,\nhow is it that these stories come to be told? Eliminating conscious\nswindling\u2014and the Moses records do, as it seems to me, fairly eliminate it-\nthere is something to be explained ; and the mind will not rest satisfied with\na course of interjections.\nIt would appear that Mr. Barkworth would feel less vigorously positive\non the subject of the asserted phenomena, if he could see some physical or\n\" thinkable \" way by which they might be achieved. But there is nearly\nalways some thinkable way of doing anything, and in the present instance of\n\fMay, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 253\nthe ringing bell it is very simple, t'r.., this : \u2014Turn the hall gas out, open\nthe door quietly, carry in the bell ringing loudly to cover any noise, go out,\nshut the door, and light the hall gas again.\nMr. Barkwortli may here object that I am giving up my attitude of\nconceivable receptivity to \" the miraculous \" and \" the unthinkable,\" but it\nis not so. Whenever I am convinced of the real occurrence of an event\nwhich seems to me either miraculous (in the popular loose sense of the\nword) or unthinkable, I must at once set about trying to contemplate it, so\nas to make it thinkable ; for I feel, so to say, sure that no real event of\nwhich we can become cognisant must for ever remain beyond the grasp of\nour enlarged faculties, while I am also deeply convinced that to my present\nfaculties a vast number of occurrences, if by any imaginable process I could\nbecome aware of them, would seem entirely miraculous and unthinkable,\nalthough at the same time they are perfectly and profoundly real.\nMr. Barkworth seems determined that in the case under discussion the bell\nshall have passed through the wall, but I see no evidence whatever that the\nbell did pass through the wall. My contention, therefore, is a double one :\n(1) That there is no clear evidence of anything certainly in the strongest\nsense \"unthinkable\" in the Moses records, though there are plenty of\nthings extremely improbable ; and (2) that whenever such evidence is forth-\ncoming it will be our duty to investigate, and if necessary accept it, however\nmuch it may stretch and enlarge our grasp of the universe as based upon\npast experience.\nMr. Barkworth goes on to ask mo whether I demand proof that bells can\nnot pass through walls or that eggs do not grow on trees ? I reply, no,\ncertainly not ! The burden of proof of such events rests entirely with their\nassertors. It is one thing to be willing to receive evidence on any individual\npositive proposition, it is another to demand proof of a universal negative. Such\nproofs are to me I confess unthinkable, and creeds based upon them are\nliable to be somewhat frail since a single positive instance may suffice to\nshatter them.\nBriefly, then, it amounts to about this. I hold the same views concerning\nphysical facts that he does, until evidence to the contrary is forthcoming.\nBut when such evidence does appear, or make a reasonable show of\nappearing, I am willing even to face the risk of being deceived in order to\nscrutinise it as far as possible without prejudgment; whereas (as I under-\nstand him) Mr. Barkworth would resolutely run the risk even of rejecting\ntruth rather than face the chance of being misled by error. Both\nattitudes are reasonable, and his is undoubtedly the safer in the light of\nordinary common sense and the bulk of the experience of mankind. It is\nwith no light heart that a student of science sets himself to face the risk of\nbeing deceived : the risk looms indeed with peculiar ghastliness before him ;\nnor would he ever so set himself were it not that the other alternative, the\ndread of rejecting truth, strikes with a still deadlier chill. There is no\nantagonism between us, there can be no ultimate antagonism between\nfriends of truth, there is but a difference in the route chosen by which we\nhope to attain to the same end. We are not even on diff'erent roads, we are\nwalking on |the beach of the same eternal sea, but while one prefers the\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Lodge,\nLiverpool, April 15th, 1894.\n( To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir,\u2014Your correspondent, Mr. Thomas Barkworth, states the usual\n\" common-sense \" view of the case very well ; and he backs his statement\nby quotations from Locke, and refers to passages from Kant which certainly\nsupport his views. I cannot, however, resist breaking a lance on Professor\nLodge's side, although I confess my sympathies are, on the whole, with\nMr. Barkworth.\nThe question, I take it, turns on the conceivability or inconceivability of\nMr. Barkworth's propositions ; that the less does not contain the greater ;\nthat two bodies cannot occupy the same space at the same time ;\nand that\nmatter cannot pass through matter. Mr. Barkworth argues from the point\nof view of molar phenomena ;\nbecause, he virtually says, I cannot imagine\ntwo bricks interpenetrating each other, therefore,', no two objects ever inter-\npenetrate each other. It is well-known that two gases can interpenetrate\neach other without increase of volume. All right, says Mr. Barkworth ;\nthat is because gases are made up, so to speak, of a large number of small\nbricks placed at a great distance apart, and there is plenty of room in the\ninterstices of the tirst gas for the bricks, or to use the usual name, mole-\ncules, of the other. Mr. Barkworth evidently extends the same explana-\ntion to the contraction produced on mixing two liquids. And he doubtless\nwould have had the same conception if he had been brought face to face\nwith the penetration of two solids. But let him consider this case, not as\na convhicing proof of the incorrectness of his ideas, but merely as one which\nmay somewhat shake his cock-sureness.\nThe metal sodium is of such a density that 1 gram occupies I'OIS cubic\ncentimetres at ordinary temperature ; the element oxygen at -200 degrees is\nof such a density that 1 gram occupies 0-807 cubic centimetres. Now these\ntwo elements combine in such proportion that 4G grams of sodium occupying\n46-7 cubic centimetres unites with 16 grams of oxygen, occupying 12-9 cubic\ncentimetres. The sum is 59' 6 cubic centimetres. But 62 grams of the\ncompound occupies only 21-7 cubic centimetres. Is this not interpenetra-\ntion of matter? Where are the odd 37-9 cubic centimetres? Mr. Bark-\nworth would answer, the sodium and the liquid oxygen are both porous, and\nthe pores in one are occupied by the matter of the other. Are they ? If so,\nsurely some proof should exist of the pores. One plan of diminishing the\nvolume of a substance is by compressing it ;\nanother is by lowering the\ntemperature. Now these methods, applied to sodium and to liquid oxygen,\nproduce a minute decrease in volume ;\nbut they are wholly unable to account\nfor the enormous disappearance of 37-9 cubic centimetres out of 59-6.\nI have chosen this one simple instance to show Mr Barkworth that\nchemists and physicists are led to inquire whether the \"common-sense\"\nview is always to be trusted. Some of us take the view that what we call\nmatter is merely one of the factors of energy ;\nand regard it as conceivable\n\fMav, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 255\nthat if kinetic energy could be converted wholly into radiant energy, the\nmatter would cease to exist. True, this has never been done ; but one\nform of energy is convertible into others.\nIn fact, Sir, the whole affair is a mystery. We are far from fathoming\nnatural phenomena ; and it is this mystery which has led one, and no\ndoubt has led others to think that, while tending to maintain extreme\nscepticism regarding such revelations as those which have raised this discus-\nsion, it is worth while to chronicle and compare them, in tlie hope that\neventually some way may be found which will explain them psychologically\nor jihysically, and will cause them to lit in with the system of \" normal\n\"\nevents which we are accustomed to deal with. \u2014I am, Sir, yours faithfully,\nW. Ramsay.\n{To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir, \u2014May I be allowed to make one or two remarks on a few of the\ncriticisms \u2014 lately appearing in the Journal \u2014 of Mr. Stainton Moses'\nmediumship ? Mr. Barkworth, who was the first to enter the field, is to be\ncongratulated on possessing the gift of clairvoyance or second sight in so\nuncommon a degree that he is able\u2014not having ever been present\u2014to ex-\nplain for us the nature and causes of the various plienoniena that took place\nat our seances much more lucidly than we could ever hope to do ourselves.\nStill, I fear I must adhere to my own opinion as to the nature of these same\npheno:nena, and perliaps Mr. Barkworth may be induced to regard this\nfurther evidence of \" moral weakness \" on my part more leniently, when I\nremind him that, at the seances in question, I was present and he was not.\nTo turn to Mr. Lang's letter\u2014I should like to set his mind at ease as\nregards the \"distinguished composer story.\" I agree with him that it might\nhave been considered suspicious, not to say \"awkward\"\u2014if taken as an\nincident standing alone\u2014had tlie name in question been Mendelssohn ; but\nit wasn't. On the occasion of that incident, I did not look round on being\ntold of the column of light behind me. Having learnt by previous ex-\nperience that I could not see subjective lights, I never looked for them, as I\nknew it was useless. I still regard the occurrence as a fair proof of spirit\nidentity,as the signature could not have been written by Mr. Moses. My hand\nnever left the paper during the sitting, and between Mr. Moses and myself was\na large table nearly five feet in breadth. Either I must have written the\nmessage (a suggestion which might possibly be utilised), or it must have\nbeen the work of some unseen agency. In any case it was curious that the\nphotograph selected by the medium corresponded witli the signature on my\npaper, unless, of course\u2014to amplify my previous suggestion\u2014the whole thing\nwas an elaborate but somewhat pointless joke, prearranged by Mr. Moses\nand myself, for the purpose of hoodwinking the remaining sitters. In that\ncase, I wonder who Mr. Moses' accomplice was before I joined the circle.\nConcerning the appearance upon the scene of scent, pearls, stones, etc.,\nif Mr. Moses himself performed these feats, he ought certainly to have\nranked as one of the greatest masters of conjuring and sleight-of-hand the\nworld has yet seen. It occurs to one to wonder where and when he acquired\nhis marvellous skill, and why he didn't make his fortune by it, instead of\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May. 1894.\nfrittering away his talents on the profitless befooling of one or two of his\noldest and most intimate friends. I should like to submit a few reasons\nwhich ought to convince any moderately \"open mind,\" how next door to\nimpossible it was for Mr. Moses to \" work \" the manifestations himself.\nFirstly, it was not an uncommon thing for pearl and coral beads to be\nscattered about the room when we were not holding a stance, and in broad\nday-light. None of us could possibly tell where these things came from\u2014\nbut it'was perfectly patent that no one present had any hand in their\nproduction.\nSecondly, when various ;i,rticles were brought durmg a seance, the\nmedium's hands were frequently held on both sides, also those of the rest\nof the sitters ;\nresults were never affected thereby.\nThirdly, the same things happened when the medium was in a deep\ntrance, and unconscious of everything going on around him ;\nat such times\n'\nwe nearly always had a lighted candle upon the table, and, as I have\nremarked before, we were quite able to distinguish the medium's hands and\nface Any movement of his would have been instantly perceived.\nFourthly, various articles were often placed upon the table during a\nseance, which same articles wc had seen in an adjoining room before we left\nit Mr. Moses frequently entered the seance room first, so what I suppose\nwould be considered the natural inference, viz : that he brought them in\nwith him, falls to the ground.\nLastly, as showing that Mr. Moses' own mediumship was not absolutely\nessential to the production of phenomena of this kind, I may mention that,\nsittino- with two friends of my own\u2014one mediumistic, the other, like myself,\nnot -similar manifestations have taken place in our presence, on more than\none occasion, and under stringent test conditions. I refer more particularly\nto the brint'ing of various articles into a room when the doors were bolted,\nthe windows'\" barred, and all means of ingress or egress consequently\ncut off As such things have happened other than through Mr. Moses' in-\nstrumentality, why not through his ?. The suggestion of his employing\nfraudulent means to produce the various phenomena seems puerile and\nirrational-a despairing attempt to explain what admits of one satisfactory\nexplanation only : and unfortunately that is the one that many people don't\nwant, and won't have. Hinc iUce lachrymce. In all alleged cases of\nfraud, when there is no evidence except of a circumstantial nature, it has\nalways been the custom of the Law to look for a motive, and if possible to\nfind it\n\u2022\nbut in this case, those most sceptical on the subject of Mr. Moses'\nmediumship have signally failed to produce one that is either adequate or\noven reasonably probable. I am curious to know whether some of the ex-\nplanatory theories that have been put forward in this connection lately would\nbe' seriously considered as either logical, sound, or even sensible, were their\npromulgators dealing with any subject other than Spiritualism. I think not\n:\nstill it is a pleasure to read Professor Lodge's writings, and to see that the\nsubject can be approached in a serious scientific spirit, even by a sceptic.\nWould there were more sceptics like him.\u2014Faithfully yours,\nCharlton T.

[Junk, 1894.\nOne new Member and seven new Associates were elected. The election\nof eleven new Associates of the American Branch was recorded,\nThe names and addresses are given above.\nTlie Council recorded with regret the decease of the Hon. Roden\nNoel, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Society, and who had belonged\nto it almost from its commencement.\nAt his request the name of Mr. Frank H. Matthews was trans-\nferred from the list of Members to that of Associates.\nSeveral presents to the Library were reported, for which votes of\nthanks were accorded to the donors.\nOther matters of business having been attended to, the next\nMeeting of the Council was fixed for July 13th, at the Westminster\nTown Hall, at 3 p.m., previous to the General Meeting at 4 o'clock.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 66th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West-\nminster Town Hall on Friday, June 8th, at 8.30 p.m. ;\nProfessor\nSidgwick in the chair.\nThe Chairman, in opening the proceedings, communicated the fact\nthat a legacy of \u00a33,000 had been left by the late Dr. Myers to the\nPresident of the S.P.R. for the time being, in trust for the purposes of\nthe Society. The money\u2014amounting after payment of legacy duty to\n\u00a32,700 \u2014was now invested, and the income would be used in defray-\ning the expenses of the Society's investigations. He said that this\nnews would not come as a surprise to those Avho knew the unfailing\ninterest which Dr. Myers had always taken in tlieir work, and the\nextent to which he had spent not only his time and thought, but also\nwhen occasion arose, his private means, for the furtherance of that\nwork ; and it would be a source of satisfaction to them that the\nincrease in stability which the Society thus gained, and the enlarge-\nment of its means for carrying on its researches, should be associated\nwith his memory.\n\" Miss X.\" then read a paper on \" The Apparent Sources of Super-\nnormal Experiences.'' She proposed to deal with the question ex-\nclusively fronr \"the subject's point of view\"; and also to confine\nherself to purely spontaneous experiences, in order to exclude the\nelement of self-consciousness introduced by experiment. At the same\ntime, it should be borne in mind that the inevitable condition of\nsurprise, attaching to spontaneous experiences, in some sort disqualified\nthe subject for exact observation.\nShe then proceeded to distinguish, and illustrate by carefully\nrecorded and attested examples from her own experience, the following\nthree kinds or stages of supernormal messages.\n\fJune, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 259\n1. The impulse to deliver a statement which seems to owe its\ngenesis to something apart from one's own consciousness, to be in-\ndependent of reason or memory, perhaps analogous to the messages of\nclairaudience or automatic writing, but having no corresponding sense\nimpression.\n2. The externalisation of an idea, a symbolic presentation of an\nimpression consciously or sub-consciously made,\n3. A definite sense hallucination, presenting some fact sub-con-\nsciously acquired by thought-transference, clairvoyance or other means.\nAs an example of (1) she narrated the following experience :\n\" I was recovering from recent illness, and had spent the whole of a July\nmorning lying on a long chair in the garden. I could not move without\nhelp, and was therefore incapacitated from going back to the house and\nafterwards forgetting I had done so. About 12 o'clock, a friend, calling at the\nhouse, came through the drawing-room window into the garden to talk to me.\nWhen she returned to the house, a book which she had left in the hall was\nnot to be found, and, after a prolonged hunt in every likely place, she, with\nanother friend, came back to the garden to see whether she could have left\nit near me. On hearing their story, I at once remarked, '\nThe book is on\nthe blue-room bed.' The statement seemed wildly improbable, as tlie room\nin question was not in use, and was seldom entered, even by the servants.\nThere, nevertheless, on the bed, the book was found. Some workmen had\ncome into the house during the morning, bringing a number of pictures and\nbooks to be taken care of for a short time ; and these, for safety, had been\nplaced in the disused room, the book lying on the hall table having been\naccidentally included with the new arrivals.\"\n\" Miss X.\" pointed out that it would be far-fetched to regard this\nexperience as telepathic, since the book was probably removed by the\nworkman unconsciously, and no one in the house had seen its removal\n;\nwhile, again, the impression was not in any literal sense clairvoyant,\nas there was no conscious picture in her mind ; \u2014it merely \" came into\nher head \" to utter the words quoted.\nTo illustrate the second class, she gave two interesting cases of the\nvisions of things \" in the surroundings\"\u2014as a professed medium would\nexpress it\u2014of strangers newly introduced to her : in which the effort\nmade by her to \"grasp the stranger's individuality\" was assisted by a\n\" picture forming itself in the back-ground of the stranger,\" suggesting\nsome indication of a \" dominant factor in his life or experience.\" Tn\nthe second of these cases she had seen a figure in close proximity to a\nnew acquaintance, similar to a figure seen some weeks later l^y a\nclairvoyant, as standing near the same person. In discussing this case,\n\" Miss X.\" observed that she had no means of deciding between the\ntelepathic and the spiritualistic interpretation, though personally\ninclined to the former. She could find no subjective difference be-\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1894,\ntween the visualisation of an idea and a phantasm of the dead : though\nshe found it possible to distinguish between a vision of a living friend ,\nand that of one who had passed away,\u2014\"the living phantasm brings\nwith it some hints of its surroundings, of the things with which it has\nsome real relation, the dead seems to he abstracted from any surround-\nino-s whatever.\" This last distinction she illustrated by a recent\nexperience. There Avas an old friend, an accomplished musician, whom\nshe was accustomed to visualise at his piano or organ, and among the\nsurroundings of a seaside home. On the 9th of May last, his image\ncame l)efore her as usual, but without the usual accompaniments,\u2014it\nbore no relation to anything else, and the sense of abstraction was\nvery intense. She remarked to a friend that she knew he was dead,\nand entered the impression in her diary : the next day brought the sad\nnews he had died about three hours before. She had heard a few\ndays liefore that he was getting old and feeble, but nothing more\nalarming.\nThe distinctions she had drawn between different kinds of super-\nnormal messages were sometimes difficult to apply. She described in\nsome detail a complicated experience which seemed to contain all the\nthree elements which she had tried to distinguish.\nShe dwelt on the difficulty of distinguishing the sources of suclx\nmessages, but she stated as the conclusions drawn from long\nexperience, and seven years' very careful observation,\n(1) that she found it quite impossible to mistake the intention of\nany figure which appeared to her at the moment of death :\n(2) that when the glimpse had been more than momentary, she\nhad never (she believed), even in the case of strangers, mistaken a\nvision of a deceased person for that of one still living.\nStill, as she had said, the same \"impression of abstractedness,\"\ncharacteristic of a phantasm of the dead, was also found in pictures\nwhich she was disposed to regard as \" externalisations of an idea.\"\nBut such pictures might also appear in (a) surroundings distant in\ntime and space, and so be difficult to distinguish from clairvoyance-\nexcept by objective tests ; or (b) the figures seen might appear in\nrelation to the seer's surroundings, in which case a hallucinatory\nfigure might be mistaken for a real person. Moreover, in all sub-\njective analysis and observation of this kind, there were two constantly\nrecurring difficulties\u2014the element of surprise and the element of\nexpectation.\nIn conclusion, she said that there was one difficulty of which she\nknew nothing, \u2014the alleged danger to health of mind or body. Her\nexperiences were never .so clear or so abundant as when she was in\nentire liealth,\n\fJune, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 261\nIn the discussion that followed\nMr. F. W. Hayes asked questions with regard to the particular\nexperiences described, which led to further explanations from \" Miss X.\"\nMr. Maitland said thatthe subject was capable of being treated\nat \u00a3rreat length. The Hrst axiom to be laid down was that there was\nno warrant for limiting the tenuity of any substance that may serve\nas a vehicle for mental force. He distinguished \" asti-al \" phantoms from\nastral realities, and held that \" ghosts of past events\" might be seen\nin the astral light. This had, he held, occurred in one of \" Miss X.'s\n\"\nexperiences. In another case memory had been read, as had\nhappened in his own experience. There was a great variety of orders\nof entities in the astral fluid ;\namong these he mentioned \" reflexes\n\"\nof the seer himself, dehris of disintegrating souls\u2014which often perplex\nthe spiritualists\n\u2014\" ideas of the air \" and others. Only an adept after\nyears of training could distinguish the true ray from the false, the\ncelestial from the astral.\nThe Chairman, in expressing the thanks of the meeting to Miss\nX., remarked that it was rare to find the capacity for supernormal\nperception combined with the power of self-observation and analysis,\nthe carefulness and promptitude in recording experiences, and the\nappreciation of the importance of different kinds of evidence, which\n\" Miss X.'s \" paper showed.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then spoke on \" The Evidence for Continued\nIdentity contained in Mr. W. S. Moses' Automatic Script.\"\nThe speaker began by recapitulating the reasons which in his\nopinion fully established the genuine automaticity of the messages, and\nthe complete good faith of Mr. Moses' own comments thereon. Turn-\ning to the evidence of the identity of the communicating intelligences,\nthe messages might be arranged in four groups. (1) In the hrst group\nmight be placed those messages that contained facts, which, from their\nrecency or obscurity, were probably unknown to Mr. Moses and to all\nother persons present. The cases of Abraham Florentine, of the Jones\nchildren, and one or two others, were described under this heading.\n(2) Next came messages containing facts wliich might conceivably\nhave been previously learnt by Mr. Moses, but which, if we take his\nword for it, had not so been learnt. There was here the difliculty due\nto the possibility of subliminal perception and memory ; but cases were\ngiven in which such an explanation seemed extremely improbable.\n(3) Next came a class of cases resembling the last except on this point\n\u2014that the \" controls \" seem to have less freshness and reality, and tlie\nfacts given were of the nature of extracts from books. These extracts\nwere sometimes provably unknown to Mr. Moses, and the manner in\nwhich they were given suggested clairvoyance rather than real com-\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research [Jqne, 1894.\nmiuiication from the departed. Mr. Moses had himself been fully\naware of this difference of quality ; and the questions thus suggested\nwere among the gravest with which the problem of identity was beset.\nHe (the speaker) ventured to say that the time would come when the\nhypothesis of conscious fraud or of self-delusion would fall into the\nbackground as regards these signed messages and others like them, and\nwhen even the difficulty of subliminal memory would be met by\nj udicious experiment : but the possibility of a clairvoyant acquisition of\nknowledge, unconsciously by the automatist himself, or consciously by\npersonating spirits, would long continue a stumbling-block. (4) The\nexistence of this difficulty gave an additional interest to a class of\nmessages technically lowest in evidential value ; those, namely, where\nthe evidence depended on ethical or intellectual resemblances\u2014on the\nintensity of characterisation displayed by the alleged spirit. Indefin-\nable resemblances of mind and character might produce strong sub-\njective conviction ; and the conclusion must perhaps be that for full\nsatisfaction we ought to desire in the messages a combination of the\nobjective and the subjective lines of evidence\u2014first of all the statement\nof verifiable facts known, if possible, to the deceased alone, or at any rate\nto the deceased but not to the automatist ; and then that indefinite\nbut profoundly recognisable character which made here and now for\neach of us the essential difference between one friend and another. In\nmany of Mr. Moses' cases such combination did to a great extent exist\n;\nand on the whole no series of signed messages was at once equally full\nand equally exempt from error with that with which Mr. Moses had\nbeen favoured for so many successive years.\nOBITUARY.\nRODEN NOEL.\nWe record, with deep regret, the sudden death of the Hon. Roden\nNoel, who has been a Vice-President of this Society almost from its\nfoundation. He died of heart-disease at Mayence, on Saturday, May\n26th, at the age of 59.\nThis premature close of a life devoted to \" liigh thinking \" and\nardent literary work will affect a larger circle than his personal friends\nwith a sense of irreparable loss : since, though lie never gained the eai'\nof the general public, he found \" fit audience though few \" among\nthose who value originality and intensity of poetic thought and feeling,\neven when their expression shows technical inequalities and defects.\nNo poet of our time has presented more impressively, on the one hand,\nthe delight of natural l^eauty and of the physical life in which man feels\nhimself at one with nature j\nand, on the other hand, the painfulness of\n\fJune, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 263\nthe discord continually felt between the order of the physical world\nand the profound est human yearnings and aspirations. This sense\nof the \" riddle of the painful earth\" was expressed by him, with the\nintensity of pathos given by personal bereavement, in \" A Little\nChild's Monument\" (1881); and, later, with unsurpassed force, in\n\"A Modern Faust\" (1888); and the same bent of thought and\nfeeling led him to give a cordial welcome to our investigations.\nIndeed, almost contemporaneously with the foundation of the iS.P.E,.\n(1882) he published his \" Philosophy of Immortality,\" in which\nmaterialism is combated partly by speculative arguments, partly on the\nbasis of the evidence furnished by spiritistic phenomena. Later\u2014in\n1886 \u2014he defended his views in several numbers of this Journal\n(Vol. II., pp. 158^ 195, 269) with characteristic vigour, directness,\nand candour. H. S.\nTHE ANGLO-FRENCH PSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY.\nThe subscription to this society, announced in the May Journal as\nlOf. or 8s. per annum, has, as I now lind, been fixed by the revised\nrules at 20f. or 16s. per annum. T have received about a dozen appli-\ncations for membership, and should be glad to receive more. Candidates\nwill be informed when an election takes place, and to whom their\nsubscription should then be sent.\nLady Caithness has addressed a letter to \" Light,\" describing the\nmoral and religious elevation which she regards\u2014and we shall none of\nus dispute this \u2014as the ultimate goal towards winch all discoveries in\nthis new field of science ought to tend. \" The Spiritualism I adA-ocate,\"\nLady Caithness emphatically says, \" is that of the Higher Life.\"\nThis is the kind of Sinritualism to whicli 1 have long dedicated niy life,\nand to advance which I devote all I am able to dispose of in the publication\nof books, both in French and English, of my monthly review, \" L'Aurore\ndu Jour Nouveau,\" and in weekly meetiiigs at my house, both for free public\nlectures and for private instruction and mutual improvement. I am also\nmost happy to be able to add that my dear son is animated by precisely the\nsame desire for the advancement of this, the higher Spiritualism.\nIt was while conversing on this subject with the friends mentioned in the\narticle in \"Light,\" namely Mr. F. W. H. Myers and Professor Charles\nRichet, that I learnt their vieM's on the subject, and that in their superior\nexperience they considered well authenticated phenomena to be necessary\nto convince outsiders of the spiritual side of our mysterious and comjJex\nnature, which they can better be brought to believe in and understand by\nmaterial proof, through tlioir outer physical senses.\nIn my desire to render every possible aid to the furtherance of the holy\ncause I have so much at heart, and have received the mission to promulgate,\nI at once decided that while I continued to pursue the main branch of the\nsubject, namely, its religious aspect, I would unite with them in their more\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical BesearcL [Junk, iso4.\npractical views and allow them to conduct their investigations scientifically\naccording to their own acquired knowledge.\nThere will, therefore, be different brandies in the Society, and the one\nunder my especial direction will be that of the study for the attainment of\nthe more spiritual nature which is the key to the mysteries of the Higher\nLife, for it enables us to better our condition in this life, and bring the\n\" kingdom of heaven upon earth,\" while ennobling our lives in view of our\nfuture development in the life to come.\nMakie Caithness db Pojiak.\nFor myself I will add that, while the constitution of our Society\nprecludes any such corporate expression of ethical or religious views as\nmay interfere with the complete catholicity of its scientific stand-point,\nI think that most of my friends are, like myself, in full sympathy with\nthe belief which Lady Caithness has so often and so earnestly expressed,\nthat a conviction on such problems as we discuss, even when gained by\nscientific methods alone, ought to affect, not only a man's scientific\nbeliefs, but his conduct, his character, and the whole structure and sub-\nstance (so to say) of his spiritual being.\nF.

I think myself fortunate in having progressed\nso far in this direction that the many subjects incidental to the recent dis-\ncussion in these columns have, by the gradual discarding of contentions\nseen to be unnecessary, or inconclusive, been reduced to the one question\nwhich I have placed at the head of this letter. Expressed more fully it is\nthis : Are there, or are there not, certain propositions the alleged evidences\nfor which it would be mere waste of time to examhie,* and which there-\nfore we should reject not only without evidence, but even in spite of it ?\nStated thus abstractedly, I doubt if there is anyone who would hesitate\nto answer in the affirmative, unless it were certain spiritists who seem to have\nadopted, for their own, the saying of Tertullian\u2014 Crec^o ipxia ahmvdum est.\nTrue it is that fresh and unexpected facts are continually coming to light in\nthe natural world ; and that, by ol)Serving these facts systematically, new laws\nare gradually evolved, but facts and laws alike are iuvarial)ly found to be in\nharmony with the general lines of the Universe, and every fresh discovery\n''I do not here mean to express any objection to the pubHcation of the \" Ex-\nperiences \" That might be perhaps justified on widely differing grounds ;\nalthough,\npersonally, the great length of the paper seeins to me unnecessary from every\npoint of vieWi\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research.

If she appears to deny herself we may rest\nassured that is only because we have misinterpreted her or mis-applied her\nmethods. Were it otherwise, there could be no progress. For each for-\nward step must be reached from the firm foothold of immutable and\nimpregnable law, and if such things as gravitation and chemical affinity were\nsubject to capricious variations, there would be an end of all science.\nNo doubt, as the late Prof. Tyndall remarks, \"Nature is full of\nanomalies which no foresight can predict, and which experiment alone can\nreveal. From the deportment of a vast number of bodies, we should be led\nto conclude that heat always produces ex2:)ansion, and that cold always\nIjroduces contraction. But water steps in, and bismuth steps in to qualify\nthis conclusion \" {Had as Motion, p. 89.) But this is not an exception to law ;\nit is only the operation of another law as invariable as the rest. Water does\nnot expand on freezing for ninety-nine times and contract on freezing for the\nlumdi'edth. The expansion on freezing is therefore no more an exception to\nlaw, than the act of walking upstairs is an exception to gravitation.\nAgain, the progress of knowledge may be likened to a building, the stones\nof which are closed questions of the nature of indefectible certitudes. Each\nsuch certitude forms the basis of the next. On one face of the edifice the\nbuilders are at a stand for want of fresh material, and are looking here and\nthere to find it, collecting tentatively such as they can find, and disputing\nperhaps as to its fitness for the purpose. On another face, material is\nofiering almost faster than it can be put in. But whether the progress be\nslow or fast, the stones once in their places form part of the permanent\nstructure, and could not be removed without endangering the stability of the\nwhole. Two of the foundation-stones of the edifice I have already instanced\nin gravitation and chenucal affinity, but the list of certitudes like these, or\nfounded upon such, might be indefinitely extended, and no one is more\ncapable of doing this than the two learned Professors who have last addressed\nyou. Below all these again, and built into the bed-rock of the mind, are\naxioms conditioned by the mind itself and only to be perceived intuitively as\npropositions, self-evident, necessary, and universal. On these all knowledge\nultimately rests. They are incapable of proof ; otherwise they would bo\nsubject to demonstration from other truths lielow them. Being what they\nare, however, they are to the logician what the datum line is to the engineer,\nor the elementary metals to the chemist. Anyone who tampers with in-\ntuitive axioms does so at his peril.\nWhen a scientific fact or law is once for all conclusively demonstrated, no\nnew fact or law subsequently discovered can or ever will invalidate or annul\nit ; which is tlie same as saying that natural laws are nut subject to repeal.\nThe laws of dynamics are tlie same for a locomotive or a flying machine that\nthey are for a wheelbarrow.\nNot to pursue tliis subject further, let us come from the general to the\nparticular, and see its practical bearing upon tlie problems Ijefore us. Let\nit be supposed that an eminent chemist were to i^erform a simijle experiment\nwhich he had repeatedly tried before and which immbers of other persons\nhad in previ ous times also performed, and always, necessarily, with the same\n\fJune, 1894.] Jowmal of Society for Psychical Research. 267\nresult. But on this occasion, the result appears strangely different. What\nmay we suppose would be his attitude in face of such a contingency '?\nWould\nhe say \"This experiment having, for the first time in history, produced an\nabnormal result throws doubt upon all that was known about it before,\" or\nwould he not rather say \" There is a mistake somewhere. Either one thing\nlias been over-heated, or another has been under-estimated, or my assistant\nhas inadvertently substituted one ingredient for another. What the nature\nof the error may be, is not worth enquiring into. The experiment has\nfailed, not because Nature is capricious, but because the conditions have not\nbeen observed.\"\nWhen the missionary Moffat was travelling in South Africa half-a- century\nago, he encountered a tribe who assured him that m a neighbouring country,\nthe moon always rose in the West. Of course he denied that it could be so.\nI cannot now fully recall the discussion which ensued, but the natives\nanswered in effect, although with a sarcasm jjrobably less refined than Mr.\nSpeer's, that Moffat's denial was not much to the point because \"they were\npresent on the occasions in question, and he was not.\"\nWhat was the ground of confidence which enabled the chemist, in the\nimaginary instance, to reject the evidence of his senses, and the missionary,\nin the real one, to refuse the testimony of other people ']\nIt was that to the\ninmost core of their being they were convinced that Nature never deceives.\nLike causes, operating under like conditions, produce like effects ; and will\nconthiue to do so always, everywhere, and for all men, while the world lasts.\nThose readers who have had the patience to follow me thus far will be\nprepared for tlie final step in my argument. Since men came upon the earth,\nobjects of sensible size coming into contact with fixed obstacles, have either\nbeen arrested, or deflected, or have penetrated the obstacle by the removal of\na part of its substance equal to the size of the object. When, therefore, half-\na-dozen people come forward and assert that they, sitting in a darkened\nroom, \" with a hush of expectation, and faces (if they could have been seen)\nof awe-stricken earnestness\" i.e., in a state of mental expectancy which\nprepared them to believe anything the \"spirits \" chose to reveal, have, on the\nevidence of what they are pleased to call their senses, proved Nature to bo\na trickster, and that throughout the ages she has kept a card up her sleeve to\nflash upon them at the end of the 19th Century, in a Hampstead drawing-\nroom, I say, bluntly, that T do not believe it. \"Men were deceivers\never,\" but Nature cannot beti-ay, because she wears the impress of her\nMaker, and His truth is written upon her lineaments.\nSo far the argument from the material side. But from the mental side it\nis at least equally strong, for if a bell can pass through a wall without making\na hole in it, then either the matter of the obstacle must be in its accustomed\nplace and at the same time someft'\/ic; t else, or the object penetrating it must\n(as I endeavoured to shew in the April Number) be itself, and at the same\ntime sometli'mij else. And these conclusions are self-contradictory, and\ntherefore unthinkable. For the propositions that a thing cannot be in two\nplaces at once, and that it cannot be itself and at the same time something\nwholly different, fulfil all the conditions of an intuitive axiom ;\ni.e., they are\nself-evident, necessary, and universal.\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1894.\nAt this ijoint I will anticipate an objection which someone is probably\nwaiting to make. It will be said \" If you reject records of phenomena\non (( ^>\/7'oci grounds, because of their apparent incredibility, why do you\nattend to those of phantasms, clairvoyance, and psychical phenomena of any\nkind '!\nAnd what business have you in the Psychical Society at all 1 Are\nnot many of these things beyond the reach of reason, and have they not to\nbe accepted as facts on evidence, without our being able to account for them 1\n\"\nMy answer to tliat is : To fail in satisfying the reason is one thing : to openly\nviolate it is quite anothei. And that is the difference between a miracle\n(however defined) and an impossibility. The incredibility we have been dis-\ncussing is not merely apparent, but intrinsic, and inexpugnable.\nDr. Lodge shews how little he appreciates the argument I intended\nto convey, when he says that as soon as he is convinced of an event which\nseems untliinkable, he \" must at once set about trying to contemplate it, so\nas to make it thinkable.\" Does he then believe that if he were to set about\nthinking of an object being wholly in two places at the same time, he would\nat the end of a week be any nearer doing so than when he began '{\nI have already remarked, in the February Number, on the essential\ndifference between physical and psychical investigation. In the latter we\nhave but little accumulated experience, and practically no formulated laws.\nConsequently everything is open to experiment and speculation. The\nPsychical Researcher is like the physiologist before Hippocrates ;\nhe has to\nfind out everything for himself without the unearned increment of knowledge\nwhich the physicist has inherited from his predecessors. But this freedom\nof speculative vagrancy should make the psychical student all tlie more tena-\ncious of those few certainties and elementary truths which fall to his lot\nfrom across the frontier of natural science.\nIt is with unfeigned surprise that I find myself driven into arguing against\nthe practice of free enquiry, having so often had to hisist on the clahns of\nany well-attested event to investigation. But this was in relation to psychical\nphenomena, of the causes, and processes of which, we have no certain know-\nledge and cannot refer to demonstrated laws. The case is totally difiereiit\nwhen the alleged events are of a nature not only to transcend, or even\nsupersede, but to violate and reverse the most elementary and universal\nphysical laws, the operation of which are matters of daily and hourly\nexperience. It is a matter for observation and not for dogmatism, whether\na telepathic message may he received from the antipodes, or a veridical\nphantasm of a deceased person be made evident to a living one. It is a\nmatter of certainty and not of speculation that a solid object cannot be made\nto pierce a fixed obstacle without making a hole in it ; and so far as it is a\nsubject for e.Kperiment, the experiment may h& renewed at will, and with a\nforegone conclusion, as often as desired.\nThe subject is of importance for everyone, Ijecause it is precisely this\nwillingness to believe anything, on what is called evidence, that threatens\nthe enquirer witli an intellectual degradation such as has overtaken some\nable and even brilliant minds.

Neverthe-\nless, that is precisely the position I venture to recommend in regard to\npsychical research, and when the sporadic vagaries of psychical phenomena\nare under investigation. Here we walk in the midst of pitfalls, and must\nneed say, Let Nature be true and every man a liar.\nThere are many other points I should like to notice, but must only do so\nin the briefest manner. \" How these stories came to be told \" is a subject\nquite foreign to this discussion, for if the alleged occurrences are truly im-\npossible, the causes which led to their being asserted possess only a personal\nor academical interest. There are, I should say, at least half-a-dozen 2)ossible\nways of accounting for them, but I am not going to discuss any of them.*\nProfessor Ramsay asks me a question on a subject of which I am absolutely\nignorant, and appears to imply that, because I cannot answer it, therefore\nno answer is, or ever will be , known or discovered . That assumption ,\nthough\nilattering, is not sufficiently attractive to tempt me into discussing a subject-\nI know nothing about, t Neither am I competent to pronounce on whether\n\"if kinetic energy could be converted wholly into radiant energy, matter\nwould cease to exist.\" All I know is that, in such a case, there would be\nan end of the Cosmos, and of the human race, and even of the Royal Society.\nIn the meantime, we can only deal with the Cosmos as we find it. .T. S\nMill states, if I remember rightly, that \"there may be another world in\nwhich two and two make five,\" but that world is not any of which we have\nexperience, or have faculties fitted to comprehend.\nIn finally taking leave of this discussion, I wish to say tliat I have no-\nthing to complain of in the way in which I have been met. Those who go\nto the wars must expect blows. I have been told that I am \"dogmatic,\"\n\"ejaculatory,\" \" interjectional,\" \"cock-sure,\" \"emotional,\" &c., and, what\nseems worst of all, that I have exercised common sense. For my own part,\nI consider arguments preferable to epithets, but then I am not a Fellow of\nthe Royal Society. I have therefore, only to plead in extenuation of these\nenormities, that when I have called certain things impossible, unthinkable,\nand so on, I did not use these words merely to relieve my feelings, still less\nto exasperate those of my opponents, but as the deliberate expression of\nopinions carefully considered, which I have given reasons for to the best of\nmy ability, and with a fullness for which I must apologise to your readers.\nI have endeavoured to sliew that the idea of an object such as those de-\nscribed penetrating an obstacle without leaving any trace of its passage is\nincompatible with the facts of science on the one hand, and with the laws of\nmind on the other.

I rate it indeed rather lower than in my\nlast letter was perhaps manifest. He likewise says that it is with unfeigned\nsurprise that he finds himself driven into arguments against the practice of\nfree inquiry ; and I must say that I mildly share that surprise.\nHere I might stop, were it not that there are a few apt anecdotes and\nillustrations in his last letter which emphasise very clearly the difference\nbetween a reasonable and enlightened mind of the Theological type and a\nditto ditto of the scientific type.\nDr. Moffat is said to have encountered a tribe of savages who told him\nthat in a neighbouring country the moon rose in the west. Very well, the\ninstance serves. The missionary or theologian thus encountered says things\necpiivalent to \"Pooh ! nonsense, I don't believe it, where do you expect\nto go to? Nature never deceives,\" and so on. The person with .scientific\ninstincts is more inclined to leave Nature to take care of her own morality,\nnor is he wishful to give utterance to his own views on the subject of the\ncelestial motions ; he is simply anxious to elicit genuine first-hand state-\nments from the informants, to find out why they say so and what they mean.\nHis patient and catechetical attitude would no doubt seem to the more\nconsciously enlightened person grotesque, if not mad ; nevertheless the\ninformation as to what a savage tribe means by \"west\" might turn out\ninteresting to an anthropologist or a student of folk-lore. I suppose Mr.\nBarkworth knows what he himself means by \" west,\" and perhaps he\nexpects a savage's definition to agree with that of a European astronomer,\nbut in this he might be disappointed. Even so civilised a person as the\njDrophet Daniel may conceivably have centred his points of the compass at\nJerusalem rather than at the North Pole.\nMany statements which bear a superficial aspect of craziness are not so\ncrazy when understood. For instance, Mr. Cope Whitehouse, I believe, holds\n\fJune, 189-1.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 271\na dogma that the building of the pyramids was carried on from the top\ndownwards and not from the bottom upwards. \"Sheer lunacy 1\n\" is the natural\nman's exclamation, and Mr. Barkworth would apparently add that Cope\nWhitohouse could not have been made (like Nature !) in the image of his\nMaker, or he would not thus basely attempt to deceive. The dogma is in\nall probability false enough, but it is not lunacy. Nor does it so appear to\na patient person when he realises that the pyramids are, by Mr. Whitehouse,\nsupposed to enclose each a natural conical hill, whose escarpments were\nutilised as building material and deposited at the top in the form of an apex\nforming the nucleus of a complete artificial enclosure.\nIt is possible to be too hasty at jumping to conclusions. If a view is held\nor fact asserted in serious earnest by persons not manifestly half-witted it\nmay be worth consideration ; and if the assertions are of a kind which have\nbeen repeated again and again in various epochs of the world's history, and\nby a large body of respectable persons, then a sane and sober record of a\nfavourable specimen of such assertions is surely worthy of much space in the\nproceedings of a Society founded for the express purpose of investigating\nsuch alleged occurrences. If a record like that of Stainton Moses is to bo\nexcluded, I really do not know what it behoves us to put in. Facts concern-\ning '\n' gravity and chemical affinity \" are already dealt with by other societies,\nand perhaps the statements made concerning these things are not always\nand absolutely perfectly true. Parenthetically also I may say that a chemist\nwhose attitude towards new and unexpected occurrences was of the con-\ntemptuous order imagined as probable by Mr. Barkworth would not make\nmany discoveries. Such troublesome failures often turn out of vital interest ;\nas Mr. Ci'ookes, for instance, must be well. able to tell us.\nMr. Barkworth challenges us to reject all the physical side of the Moses\nevidence, a priori, because \" the idea of an object such as those described\npenetrating an obstacle without leaving any trace of its passage is incom-\npatible with the facts of science on the one hand and with the laws of mind\non the other.\" Now, no person witli a scientific imagination could have\nmade this statement. Perhaps the phrase \" Maxwell's demons \" conveys to\ntlie lay-mind no adequate conception, and it would take too long to explain ;\nbut it is surely apparent that if in the progress of discovery cohesion could\nbe temporarily suspended, a trepanning operation might, be performed on a\nsolid partition sufficient for the transmission of an object without any finally\napparent trace of its passage. Or, if time is not of the essence of the\nquestion, we may picture the incredulity of a future inhabitant of earth, say\nin the days of William Morris's Earthly Paradise, when railways had bei-\ncome extinct, their tunnels closed up and grass-grown, who should be told\nof ancient legends reporting that engineers had once been accustomed to\npoke savage works of art, in the form of dining-cars, through the range of\nthe St. Gothard from Switzerland to Italy\n.\nNo, sir, I do not propose to reject any serious and solid evidence on a\npriori grounds, and it is my earnest hope that the scientific men of the\nfuture, whatever greater influence they may then possess, will never allow\nthemselves to become a narrow-visioned priesthood, or to imitate the errors\nof other dominant sects.\u2014Yours faithfully, Oliver J. Lodge.\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1894.\nP.S. \u2014There is an interrogation in Mr. Barkworth's postscript as to\nwhat the discussion has been about.\nOn my side it has quite distinctly been about the following :\n\u2014 (1)\nWhether the unusual physical phenomena asserted to have occurred in the\npresence of Mr. Stainton Moses are of so impossible and unthinkable a\ncharacter as to compel their immediate rejection without record and without\nexamination of evidence ; and (2) whether it is rational or scientifically\nlegitimate so to reject otherwise trustworthy evidence, even though the\nphenomena asserted should ajjpear at first sight unthinkable.\nQuestions as to the actual evidence in any particular instance have been\nbeside the point ;\ncertainly there was no evidence that I remember concern-\ning a \" wall.\" I used the illustration of the entering bell to show that what\ncould readily be done by an exuberant schoolboy or obsequious valet need\nnot involve any necessarily untliinkablc powers on the part of what Mr.\nBarkworth calls \" the unseen agency.\" I was not suggesting the process by\nwhich the feat was actually performed on any given occasion.\nSin,\u2014 Just one word in comment on Mr. Barkworth's letter in this issue,\nof which I have been favoured with a proof. He writes :\n\u2014\" Would [the\nchemist] not rather say, '\nThere is a mistake somewhere. Either one thing\nhas been over-heated, or another has been underestimated, or my assistant\nhas inadvertently substituted one ingredient for another. What the nature\nof the error may he is not worth inquiriri.g into* The experiment has failed\nnot because Nature is capricious, but because the conditions have not been\nobserved.'?\n\"\nThis sentence typifies the different attitudes taken up by Mr. Barkworth\nand his critics. I can assure him that the chemist would say nothing of the\nsort. He might suspect it ; but he would say : \"Here is something worth\ninquiring into : it may lead to a new discovery ; at all events, we must\nprobe it to the bottom and lind out why an abnormal result has been\nobtained.\"\nHe will not consider himself shackled by the doctrines of gravitation or\nchemical affinity (I wish I knew what chemical affinity is I), but would lit his\ntheories to his facts.\nThe proposition that a thing cannot be in two places at once does not\nseem to me to differ in essence from the proposition that two things may l)e\nin one place at the same time ; and I place the fact mentioned in my former\nletter at Mr. Barkworth's service, not with a view of receiving any explana-\ntion, but simply as a fact.\nIn spite of these remarks, it must not be understood that I in any way\naccept the phenomena the credibility of which Mr. Barkworth disputes ;\nlike Boyle, I maintain the attitude of the \" Sceptical Chymist.\"\nW.

Crookes\nin the chair.\nProfessor Sidgwick read the following paper on \" Disinterested\nDeception.\"\nI have chosen the subject of my paper this evening, in view of the\n\u2022\ndesirability of throwing any light that can be thrown on the\nphenomenon of Disinterested Deception, at the present stage of our\nresearches ; \u2014I mean the stage initiated by Mr. Myers in presenting to\nthe Society and to the public the experiences of Mr. Stainton Moses.\nI should like to say at the outset that I cordially welcomed Mr.\nMyers' article : I regard it as one of the most important pieces of\nwork that has been done for some time in furtherance of the aims\nwhich our Society was founded to promote. It is important, because\nit brings us face to face with a most difficult choice of alternatives.\nThere seem to me to be three possible explanations of the records\npublished by Mr. Myers :\n1. That the marvels occurred substantially as narrated.\n2. That what happened has been grossly and, at the same time,\nconsistently exaggerated by all present.\n3. That Mr. Stainton Moses carried on a laborious and systematic\ndeception, first of his intimate friends, and afterwards\u2014to the end of\nhis life of the public, with no apparent motive of personal interest.\nThe difficulties involved in the first supposition are trite and\nfamiliar, and I will not weary you by dwelling on them now : the\nsecond I dismiss, as no one has seriously maintained it. I propose to-\nday to consider how far the experience gained in an investigation of\nmany years enables us to bring forward any proved case of elaborate\nmotiveless deception at all parallel to that which we should have to\nsuppose in the case of Mr. Moses, if we accepted the third alternative.\nThere are half-a-dozen instances known to me of confessed or\ndemonstrated deception in cases where no mocive of pecuniary interest\ncould come in. But most of these are obviously dissimilar to that now\nbefore us\u2014from the youth or inferior education of the persons con-\ncerned\u2014and there is only one which appears to me to afford any\nimportant parallel. This I now propose to narrate fully ;\nas it seems\nto me instructive in various ways.\n\fJuly, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 275\nSome years ago I heard from a friend that a near relation of his\n\u2014whom I will call Mr. Z. \u2014had been engaging ia psychical experi-\nments ; and had turned out to be a medium, with a power of raising\ntables from the ground and carrying them through the air with his\nhands touching the upper surface only. I inquired further, and found\nthat Mr. Z. was not only a professional man of good social status,\nbut that he had devoted his leisure industriously to the study of a\n\u2022department of learned research, and the composition of books and\narticles which had gained him at least a respectable position among\nstudents of the subject. I found too that the phenomena occurred in\na private circle composed mainly of his near relations and intimate\nfriends. It seemed to me a case that obviously came within our\ngeneral plan of investigation : accordingly I obtained an introduction\nto him, and was allowed to be present on several occasions when the\nphenomena were produced. There was no doubt that tables were\nraised from the floor, suspended in the air, carried through the air,\nwith the hands of Mr. Z. \u2014and sometimes of one or two other members\nof the circle\u2014 only touching the top. It was clearly a phenomenon\nof much interest, if there was no conscious deception.\nDeception seemed to me in a high degree improbable from what I\nknew of Mr. Z. ; at the same time the conditions under which the\nphenomenon took place, and the opportunities of testing allowed to the\ninvestigators, were not such as to enable me to bear any testimony to\nthe impossibility of its occurrence by normal means. As I frankly\n\u2022explained to him in conversation, the interest of the phenomena as\nwitnessed by me depended entirely on the assumption of his good faith.\nWell, things went on : we explained to him the conditions that\nappeared to us satisfactory ; but difEculties were made about the\nacceptance of them ; and the situation as regards evidence was not\nmaterially changed when my wife, who joined with me in the investiga-\ntion, received from a lady who had been present at two successive\nseances a letter containing the following statements :\n\u2014\nFehrvary 28f\/i, 1891.\nOn both Wednesday 18th and Thursday 19th February, I twice saw, under\nMr. Z's right wrist, a long, thin, greyish object, running up under his cuff at\none end, and into the palm of his hand at the other end. I am to my owa\nsatisfaction convinced I saw this, as far as one can be of a thing; one does not\ntouch. . . .

It was distinct, and it\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 189*.\nwas just in the place where such an implement would be of use. His right\nhand was not raised as completely from the table as the left hand was.\n. . , also two of the middle fingers were kept close together on the table.\n. . . On both occasions of the table going up the cuff was tightly strained\nto the arm. . .\nIt seems to me that it will be very difficult to find any experiments satis-\nfactory. . . . except done under your conditions. . . . full light,\ncuff up, and sitting near ;\nquite near as I was.\nNotwithstanding this letter, it still appeared to my wife and myself\nhighly improbable that Mr. Z. could have been guilty of the conduct\nimputed to him ;\naccordingly, we determined to suspend our judg-\nment and wait for further evidence. In a few months this\nfurther evidence came. Mr. Z.\u2014who knew that, in our view, his\nphenomenon would be more impressive if his arms were bared while the\ntable was held up in the air\u2014did actually exhibit the phenomenon\nunder this condition, on an occasion on which my wife was present.\nOwing to inadequate opportunities of observation, she did not regard\nthe experiment as decisive ; but it certainly seemed to her that the\neffect could not have been produced by the instruments described in\nthe letter that I have quoted. But, after some time had elapsed, she\nreceived from another lady who had taken part in the seance last\nmentioned the following interesting account of what really happened :\n\u2014\nIn September, 1891, I went to Mr. Z.'s for two nights to assist at seances.\nMr. and Mrs. Z., Miss A., and Mrs. Sidgwick were there both nights. On\nthe second day I was asked to go into the garden and talk over a new experi-\nment with Mr. Z. He talked vaguely on the subject at first, and then said\nhe wanted to try a quite new experiment that night, but it depended a good\ndeal on whether I would help him : I promised to do all I could, and he\nexplained that he wished to ted Mrs. Sidgwich's poujers of ohsermtion, and\nsee whether she could distinguish between natural and fraudulent table-\nlifting. He then explained liow he would do this, and I at once objected\u2014\nbut he argued down everything I said and represented it entirely as a test of\ngreat interest\u2014he said he had as much right to a test as Mrs. Sidgwick, &c.\nHe seemed so extremely anxious to cry it that I felt I hardly could decline.\nThe whole thing appeared to me in a ludicrous light at the time, as I never\nsuspected him of any other motive. . . . [Our informant explains that\nit was understood they were to laugh over it next morning.] He then asked\nme to come to the library, produced two flat sticks covered with black cloth\n(about an inch wide and long enough to reach from wrist to elbow) and\nshowed me how to use them ; I found it difficult, having weak wrists, and\ntried to get out of it all by saying it was physically impossible, but here he\nwas obdurate, and we went down to tea on the understanding that I was to-\ndo my best. During the evening I much regretted having undertaken even,\nto try the test, and if I could have seen Mr. Z. alone for a moment I should\nhave told him I must disappoint him : but he seemed to avoid me till the\ntime came for the seance. Up to this time no suspicion ever crossed mjr\n\f-July, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 277\nmind ; I believed it to be just what he said, a \" test,\" and that next day the\nmatter would be public property of the \"circle.\" Having seen Mr. Z. lift\nthe table in the afternoon with great skill, I tried to see the difference\nmyself between natural and fraudulent movements. To my horror I saw\ndistinctly that Mr. Z. was moving it exactly as he had done in the afternoon :\nhis hands were exactly in the same position on the table and I caught sight\nof the instruments in his cuffs.\nThis was the first part of the seance. Mr. Z. then left the room to\nchange his coat for a loose sleeveless gown\u2014in order to prove that\nthe phenomena could not possibly be produced by any instruments up\nhis sleeves. Our informant goes on :\n\u2014\nJust before leaving the room to change his coat Mr. Z. sat on the sofa by\nme and slipped the sticks behind me. Only Miss A. and he and I were at\nthe table.\n(Mrs. Sidgwick sat at the side of the room.)\nI could not raise it at all for some time, and he was getting impatient.\nThe experiment was a failure, though I believe the table was once really off\nthe ground for a few seconds.\nThat is, it was lifted off by our informant with the sticks. Our\ninformant then describes how she wrote, telling Mr. Z. what she had\nseen, and asking for an explanation ; how all explanation was refused ;\nhow she insisted on resigning, but wh s persuaded to say nothing about\nthe fraud until she learnt that he\u2014along with other members of the\ncircle, each speaking for himself\u2014had signed a declaration that the\nphenomena at these seances had \" not been produced by normal\nmeans.\" She then felt that she ought not to keep silence, and com-\nmunicated what I have told you to Mrs. Sidgwick. (Mrs. Sidgwick's\npreviously written account of the same seance states that Mr. Z.\ntold her before dinner that everything was to lead up to a special\nexperiment for her benefit, and that, in fact, the table was raised\nin the air with Mr. Z.'s arm bare for several inches above\nthe wrist). I need not say that the letter above quoted, con-\nfirming as it did the observations previously communicated to us,\nremoved all doubt as to Mr. Z.'s modus operandi ; and though, out of\nregard for others, we determined not to publish his name, we took\neffectual means to prevent a repetition of his trickery. The letter is\ninteresting in another way ; it shows how a perfectly honourable and\nwell-intentioned person may be persuaded by a plausible and in-\ngenious trickster, first, to take part in deception and then to conceal\nthe part so taken ; since, if Mr. Z.'s audacity had stopped short of\ndeclaring solemnly that his tables had not been raised by normal\nmeans, the disclosure from which I have quoted would probably never\nhave been made.\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jply, 1894.\nI pass to consider how far Mr. Z.'s case resembles, and how far it\ndiffers from that of Mr. Stainton Moses. The experience that I have\nnarrated certainly shows that a professional man of good social posi-\ntion and intellectual interests may carry on systematic deception for\nyears, with no apparent motive except (I suppose) the pleasure of\nexciting the wonder of his deceived friends, and the pleasure of laugh-\ning in his sleeve at their credulity. But here the resemblance ends.\nMr. Z. (1) never professed to regard his \"phenomena\" as a possible\nbasis for religious or philosophical conclusions, or to take a serious\ninterest in the scientific investigation of them : and (2) he consistently\nrefused to publish any account of them in his own name. How\nentirely different Mr. Stainton Moses' behaviour was in both respects\nhas been amply shown in Mr. Myers' article.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then addressed the meeting on the subject of\n\" Objections to Mr. Stainton Moses' physical phenomena, and replies\nthereto.\" Alluding to Professor Sidgwick's speech above reported,\nwith which he expressed full agreement, Mr. Myers said that, in justice\nto Mr. Stainton Moses, one of the many points of difference between\nthe two cases ought briefly to be noticed. On the one hand, while the\nd priori arguments in favour of the \" disinterested deceiver's \" honesty\nwere doubtless strong, they were arguments based almost exclusively\non external circumstances. There was nothing in the personal impres-\nsion made by \" Mr. Z.\" to dispose the observer to regard him otherwise\nthan simply as an alleged medium to be investigated. In the case of Mr.\nStainton Moses, on the other hand, it would have been impossible (in\nthe speaker's view) to doubt the intense earnestness of his life-long\nsearch after truth. His very defects were all on that side : they were\nthe defects, not of the plausible charlatan, but of the sometimes\nblundering and irritable apostle.\nPassing on to discuss Mr. Moses' physical phenomena, the speaker\nendeavoured to show that if we allowed to spirits the power of\nselective molecular action almost all the alleged phenomena could at least\nbe brought under a common generalisation. Some such power had\nalready been suggested by physicists for the imaginary \" sorting demons\nof Max ffell \"\n; and the hypothesis which the mere study of Mr. Moses'\nand Mr. Home's phenomena had independently suggested, turned out\nto be little more than an elaboration of a conception which had already\nbeen found convenient in speculations dealing with the ultimate laws\nof matter. It is intended to print the substance of this address m\nPart XXVII of the Proceedings.\nIn the discussion that followed,\nMr. Ckookes sa;id that he had Hstened with much interest to Mr.\n\fJuly, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 279\nMyers' address : though, without further reflection, he could not venture\nto express an opinion on the physical speculations that it contained. He\nentirely agreed with Mr. Myers as to the personal impression produced\nby Mr. Stainton Moses, of sincere and intense belief in the conclu-\nsions publicly maintained by him. His own experiments with Home\nhad convinced him of the operation of physical forces at present\nunrecognised by science.\nMr. Crookes then described how Home had taken a red-hot coal\nout of the fire and placed it on a handkerchief without burning\nthe handkerchief in the least. (SeeS.P.R. Proceedings No. XV., Vol.\nVI. pp. 103-4.) Mr. Crookes had taken the handkerchief away with\nhim and afterwards examined it chemically, without finding any trace\nof preparation ;\nalthough, indeed, there was no chemical process\nknown to him by which the effects that he had witnessed could have\nbeen produced.\nMr. Page Hopps\u2014referring to Mr. Sidgwick's paper\u2014said that\nMr. Z.'s fraud did not appear to him to have been completely proved.\nProfessor Sidgwick said that the proof consisted in the complete\nagreement between two entirely independent witnesses, one of whom\nhad seen Mr. Z. using secretly the instruments described, while the\nother had not only seen him so use them, but had herself used them\nin accordance with his instructions.\nMr. Lane Fox asked Mr. Myers what idea he had formed of the\nphysical constitution of the beings to which he attributed selective\nmolecular action.\nMr. Myees replied that he was not prepared to make any sugges-\ntions on this point.\nMr. Maitland said that it was very important to distinguish\ndiffei'ent classes of extra-human iatelligences, and not to regard physical\neffects of the kind that had been described as necessarily due to the\nagency of departed spirits. He referred for illustration to an experi-\nence of his own ; he had seen a blister produced by extra-human\nagency, similar to a blister caused by a burn.\nMr. PoDMORE rose to point out that Mr. Myers' speech had passed\nby the main objection to the phenomena recorded as having taken\nplace in the presence of Mr. Stainton Moses. Mr. Myers had en-\ndeavoured to show that the ascription of these phenomena to some new\nmode or modes of physical energy did not necessarily involve any con-\ntravention or dislocation of established physical laws. But that, after\nall, was merely a side issue : and there appeared to be some risk that\nthe attention directed, both at recent meetings of the Society and in\nthe Proceedings, to this aspect of the case might obscure the main\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1894\nquestion. We had first to ask whether the phenomena described were\nor were not due to misrepresentation or deception\u2014and this question\nwas still unanswered. Nor was the assumption of fraud on Mr. Moses'\npart so altogether incredible as had been represented. It is true that\nhe did not succeed in obtaining anything which to a sane mind could\nseem an adequate return for systematic and lifelong deception. But,\nfirstly, we must look not to what was actually achieved, but to what\nmight have been hoped for in the way of social position and reputation.\nAnd if, even so, the imposture is found inexplicable, the choice is still\nbetween a moral and a physical miracle, and of the two the\nspeaker found it less difficult to believe in the moral miracle. He\nmade these remarks with some reluctance, not attempting to prejudge\nthe matter, but solely in order to bring back into prominence what\nappeared to him to be the real question at issue.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL.\u2014 974.

One\nmorning I was in bed about 11 o'clock, when there was a knock at ray door ;\nthinking it was the house-maid with hot water, I said \" Come in.\" No one\ncame in. There was another knock ;\nagain I said \" Come in,\" and turned to-\nwards the door. My sister was standing there. I, thinking she had returned\nunexpectedly, said \" What, you, Elsie ? \" She then vanished.

On going upstairs, I saw a tall\nman so close to me that I put out my hand to push him back, but my hand\nwent into space. I again moved forward, when he was cbse in front of me,\nand, though I couldn't see his face, I recognised the figure of a great friend\nof mine in India. I went into my sitting-room, almost expecting to find\nhim there. A week later I got the news of his death at Bombay, on the\nevening of the 6th.

A\u00abP^\nReceived through the American Branch.\nFrom Miss Alice Spooner, 1.3, Michigan Avenue, Dorchester\nDistrict, Boston, Mass.\nOn the night of Saturday, February 18th, 1888,1 had a very vivid dream,\nin relation to my aunt, resident at Plymouth, Mass., who had charge of me\nin my early childhood, and of whom I am very fond.\nWe seemed to be driving together, when she said to me, \"Here I must\nleave you, and you must go the rest of the way alone.\" Soon I was read-\ning a letter which began, \" I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news,\" and\nwent on to describe the illness of some unknown person, sjieaking of\napoplexy, paralysis of the right side, incoherency of speech, &c.\nI spoke of my dream next morning in the presence of three persons,\nand of how greatly it had disturbed me. The following day I received a\nletter from a son-in-law of my aunt, which read almost word for word like\nthe letter of my dream, and sunmioned me to her bedside on account of an\nattack of apoplexy, the symptoms of which were accurately described in\nthe dream letter.

Miss\nSpooner, was duly received.\nThe affair, which happened some years ago, is a trifle indistinct in my\nmind. As I remember it, the facts are as follows : \u2014Miss Spooner dreamed\none Sunday night that she received a letter, beginning, \"I am sorry to\nsend you bad news,\" and then went on to describe the illness of someone,\nand said apoplexy, or paralysis, or something of the kind had happened\nto the person about whom he was writing. As T remember, she (Miss-\nSpooner) did not dream the name of the person who was ill, or the name of\nthe person writing the letter.\nThe next day, Monday, was very stormy, with high winds and heavy rain.\nI was then living with Miss Spooner, but came into Boston for a few hours.\nI remember returning early in the afternoon, and when the maid opened the\ndoor for me, she told me that Mrs. Hathaway had been stricken with\nparalysis, and that Miss Spooner had gone to Plymouth. On going to my\nroom I found a letter written to Miss Spooner, and beginning, \" I am sorry\nto send you bad news,\" &c., and continuing almost verbatim as Miss\nSpooner had repeated her dream that morning.\nIt impressed me strongly at the time, but I concluded it was only one of\nthe odd things of life, which no amount of reasoning can explain, and\nafter a few days dismissed it from my mind.

Ad Borderland.\nReceived through the American Branch.\nThe following case was received by Professor James from Mr. R.\nT. Van Deusen, of 600, Addison Avenue, Albany.\nMr. Van Deusen writes :\n\u2014\nJanuanj 30th, 1893.\nI am a collector, and of late a dealer, in old china. My home and business\nare in Albany, N.Y. , where I issue a small sheet, called the China Collector.\nSome 14 months since, I found an article in Scribners Magazine bearing on\nthe subject, and written by Mrs. A., cf Brooklyn, an entire stranger to\nme. I wrote Mrs. A. at the time, and may have received three to five\nletters from her, all of wliich are brief and pertaining strictly to our com-\nmon interest. Once, when in New York city, I called upon Mrs. A. at her\nBrooklyn home, meeting only her, and of course learning nothing of her\nfamily. At this call Mrs. A. expressed a desire to possess a certain specimen,\nwhich I found later on ;\nand, having a trip to town in view, decided to again\ncall and tell her of it. Arrived at the house, I was told by a maid that Mrs.\nA.'s son was very ill, and that she saw no one. In response to an inquiry, I\nwas told that they then regarded him as improving. I thus left the house\nwith the impression that he was on the road to recovery. During the next\ntwo or three weeks I frequently considered the advisability of writing, but\nhesitated for some time, fearing to intrude so trifling a matter at a time of\nanxiety and care. I, however, received a complimentary copy of her book\nCJiina Collecting in America, at this time, and acknowledged the same in a\nnote, expressing hope of recovery, &c. Very shortly after this I awoke one\nmorning at an earlier hour than usual (why I knew not), and fell into a doze,\nfrom which I was wakened at about seven by the announcement, in a low\nvoice, close to my right ear, \" Willie A. died this morning at two o'clock.\" I\nnever for a moment doubted that my wife, who sleeps in an adjoining room,\nhad been in and told me. It is her custom to wake me very gently, and I\nbelieved I heard her voice. I \"gathered \" myself rather slowly, wondering\nhow Mrs. Van Deusen could have received the information. The\nacquaintance between Mrs. A. and myself was of the sort described, and\nthere was no reason why any notification of this death should be sent us. I\nwent out into the hall, met my wife, and asked the question, only to receive\nfrom her the startled reply, \" Who is dead ?\n\" when mutual explanations and\nastonishment ensued. I was so impressed with the precise and emphatic\ncharacter of the announcement that I mentioned it to two or three friends,\n\u2022and sought to find out if it was true. I was only able to learn that the lad\ndied that night. On my next meeting with Mrs. A. this fall I asked if the\n.name of her son was Willie, and on hearing that it was not, I then explained\n'my reason for asking, when Mrs. A. told me that her son did die at tivo\no'clock that morning. Mrs. A. then volunteered the information that she had\nheard a similar case in connection with the death of her son.\nI fancy that I was too heavy with sleep to catch the first word of the\nsentence\u2014note its order.

Indeed,\nI did not even know she had a son, so slight was the acquaintance. T only\nknow of Mrs. A. as one of Mr. Van Deusen's customers. My husband\nseemed much impressed with the occurrence, and we talked more or less of\nit at the time. It gradually passed out of our minds until two or three\nmonths later, when during a call on Mrs. A. he mentioned the circumstances\nand learned the correctness of the intelligence. So much time has since\npassed, that it is impossible to recall names of those to whom it was told.\nMrs. William O. Stillman remembers the occurrence, and I presume our\nmaid, who was much in the dining-room in attendance on the table, might\nremember it, but she has left me, and I have not her address.\nMr. Van Deusen wrote to Mrs. A. for permission to give her address, as\nyou requested, but has received no reply.\nAlys B.

He told me\nthe day after he received the impression that a voice said to him the night\nbefore: \" Little Willie A. died at \u2014 o'clock.\" He told me the hour, but I\nhave forgotten it. Shortly afterwards he said to me that he heard from\nMrs. A. that the hour at which her little boy died was the hour he had heard,\nand I was quite struck by the coincidence. - Very truly yours,\nFrances Stillman.\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1894.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nAPPARENT DUALITY OP CONSCIOUSNESS UNDER MORBID CONDITIONS.\nThe following letter was addressed to Mr. Myers :\n\u2014\nDear Sir, \u2014Chancing to read in one of oar American newspapers what\npurported to be a letter from the novelist, Robert Louis Stevenson, addressed\nto yourself, and describing certain psychological phenomona of personal\n\u2022experience during abnormal mental states of the noted author,* I venture to\nsend some similar items from my own past. Both bear on the interesting\npoint of the seeming duality of consciousness in certain mental conditions.\nItem I.\nSome fifteen days after the birth of my first child, I was suffering from\nfever. I had never been ill previously within my recollection, and was a\nliealthy young woman of 23 years. One afternoon, when I had been feverish\nffor three days, a neighbour came in to chat with me. I will call her Mrs. A.\nWhile conversing rationally with her I found myself carrying on a second\nimaginary conversation with another friend, Mrs. B., who I well knew was\nnot in the room, though her presence was as real to me as that of Mrs. A.\nI had self-control enough, however, to think, not speak, my replies to my\nfancied visitor, and Mrs. A. afterwards said that my manner towards her\nwas perfectly natural. However, I knew that I was bordering on delirium ;\nknew that the figure of Mrs. B., seated beside my bed, was a creature of my\nfancy ; knew that the words which 1 seemed to hear from her were\nimaginary ; and I even tried to prevent myself from thinking my replies,\nbut that I could not do. I could only control myself enough to keep from\nspeaking, the thoughts would form themselves in spite of my efforts to the\ncontrary. By the way, my imaginary conversation with my imaginary friend\nwas not delirious in itself ; it was some commonplace chit-chat such as\nwould most possibly have passed had the lady really been present. Even at the\ntime it struck me as being strange that one part of my mind could keep\nwatch over a semi-delirious part and control it. I noted that Mr. Stevenson\n:spoke of having the same experience.\nA fortunate change for the better saved me from further unpleasant\nfancies.\nItevi II.\nWhen a little past 28 years of age I underwent a surgical operation\nnecessitating the use of ether for about an hour and a-half. Upon returning\nto consciousness part of my mind seemed to be abnormally acute ; at first\nonly at intervals, with shorter and shorter lapses into insensibility, of\nwhich lapses, however, I was thoroughly cognisant so soon as each one\npassed. But I felt instinctively that all of my bodily senses were disordered, or\nrather dulled, and I doubted not only their evidence but also distrusted part\n\u2022of my own mental action, though I fully trusted the other part, and let it sit\nin judgment on the unreliable portion. I remember thinking to myself that\nif one were in such a state for any length of time, the fact that he could not\n* See Mr. Myers' paper on \" The Subliminal Consciousness,\" in ProceedinysS.'P.'R.-,\nPart XXIv., Vol. IX., p. 9.\n\f\u2022July, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 287\ntrust his own senses and thoughts, but was only a brain with no reliable\ninlets or outlets, would soon bring on insanity. When I could not trust the\n\u2022evidence of my own touch as to whether bandages had been put on me or\njiot, though I expressly attempted to find out, still I was carefully noting\nevery mental action, and felt that I was ohmvcincj the same correcthj. I could\nnot determine whether I had been operated upon or not, and painfully took\nnote of the disposition of the furniture of my room, painfully forced myself\nto remember the operating table and all the arrangements of basins, hot\n-water vessels, &c., and then with infinite labour drew the conclusion that\n'the operation had been performed, and verified it to myself, carrying on the\nwhole during about four lucid intervals, each followed by a few moments of\ninsensibility ; and also, as I before stated, kept close watch over all my\nthoughts and feelings, as if I had been looking into some other person's brain\nthrough the agency of a fairy godmother or other gracious magician.\nI remember thinking that my experience might work into some literary\nattempts which I was thinking of making. Still, for several days beforehand\nI had not thought of this same article. The idea sprang from the clear part\nof my brain, and was suggested to it from its own observations on my state.\nI believe Mr. Stevenson spoke of feeling the same thing with reference to\n.an attack of semi-delirium from which he suffered.\nI found that I could trust the sense of hearing best ;\nnext, that of\nsight ;\nlastly, that of touch. Smell and taste were temporarily destroyed,\nof course, by the action of the ether.\nThe nurse attendant said th'it my first words were rational, and that I\nsaid nothing flighty. Before I could control myself enough to speak con-\ntinuously, 1 told her in isolated sentences how I felt, and how queer it seemed\nmotto be able to trust one's own self.\nHoping that the above may be of interest, I remain,\n(Mrs.) V. A. Lucier,\nSan Luis Potosi, Old Mexico, October Wth, 1893.\nWith the above we may compare the following case of a vivid and\nsomewhat complicated impression of dual personality, occurring\n\u2022apparently in the absence of any morbid condition whatever.\nThe HoUies. Merthyr Tydfil, December 29th, 1891.\nIn the early part of January, 1890, I was at Aberdeen, reading for my\nsecond professional examination in medicine. I was in good health, not in\nany grief or anxiety, and had not been overworking. At that time I was 23\nyears old.\nOne afternoon I had been reading notes on surgery, and was resting on\nthe sofa in the room in a semi-recumbent posture. I was thinking over\nthe reading for the next day, and arranging my times to suit lecture hours.\nIn the room were two friends of mine, H. T. H. and R. N. de B. H. was\nwriting at the table, De B. was at the piano playing some operatic airs. Da\nB. left the room and went out of the house. Shortly after this I felt much\nin the same condition that one does in a bad nightmare. I was unable to\nmove in any direction, but felt bound hand and foot. I, however, could move\nmy eyes in any direction, and I could also open and shut my eyelids easily.\nI was quite conscious of everything in the room, and noted the time, 3.49,\nlooked at the note-book in front of H. , and saw that he was transcribing\nMateria Medica notes, and in fact I was well aware of every single thing\ngoing on in the room.\nI then began arguing in my mind as to whether I could possibly be asleep\n\f288 Journal oj Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1894.\nor not. I remained in this conditioji for nearly three minutes by the clock.\nI had a continual feeling all this time that some otlier force was\n\"inhibiting\" my movements. This force seemed to act, and seemed to be\nconcentrated at a spot about a yard away from me. It seemed to be situated\nat a level of my shoulders, and slightly behind me.\nWhilst arguing with myself as to whether I was asleep or not, I suddenly\nseemed to divide into two distinct beings. The force that occasioned this\nwas that which I have described above. One of these bein;i;s remained\nmotionless on the sofa ; the other could move some little distance, and could\nactually look at the motionless body on the sofa. There existed between these\ntwo \" beings \" an elastic force which prevented the one from severing its\nconnection with the other. At will I could make the second \" being\" lie on\nthe floor, or move some distance about the room. As the distance between\nthe two beings became greater, so did the elastic force seem to become more\npowerful. A limit was soon reached at which no effort of will could effect a\nfurther severance. This limit was about two yards. When this limit was\nreached, I could feel resistance to the separating efforts in both \" beings.\"\nDuring this time, as before, I retained perfect consciousness of what was\nhapi^ening in the room. De B. had returned. I saw and heard him come in ;\nhe commenced to play the piano again, and H. was making wry faces at the\nmusic. After a great effort I managed to call H.'s name. He looked round\nand went on writing. Afterwards he gave as his reason for not answering\nthat he thought I was \" fooling \" him.\nThe dual condition continued for five minutes more. Then fusion seemed\nto set in. I resisted the feeling of fusion. It could be prevented at will.\nEventually, Avith a curiosity to know \"what was going to happen next,\" I\nallowed it to proceed. The two beings then rapidly united again. I tried to\nget into the dual condition again. This seemed to be prevented by the same\nforce that \" inhibited \" me at first.\n1 then began to think out a theory to account for all these sensations,\nand during this time the inhibiting force grew weaker and gradually\ndisappearecl. There was no sensation of waking, but simply a slow cessation\nof the conditions. The whole time I was actively engaged not only in theo-\nrising, but in recording events in the room, to see whfther I observed them\naccurately or not. As it turned out, my observations had been minutely\ncorrect. I continued to remain in the same position on the sofa ; I was\nanxious to see \"if anything more was going to happen.\" Nothing did\nhappen, so in the course of ten minutes I got up and related my experiences\nto my friends. They were much amused, but very much inclined to doubt\nthe whole affair. Their idea seemed to me to be that I had been all this\ntime manufacturing something to tell them.\nI am now in practice as a medical man. I have inquired of many people\nwith regard to such phenomena as I have described. None as yet whom\nI have asked have experienced anytliing of the kind. This is my apology for\ncommunicating the above to you.\nI have seen in my practice a case of epileptiform dual personality, but I\ndo not think that my experiences have anything in common with such cases.\nMy idea was at the time that probably the motor centres of my brain were\nasleep, the rest of the brain being in a fairly active condition.\nC.

At that\ntime, I had never within my immediate experience come across any certain\nand well-established fact of the sort.

So, although I own I am still rather sceptical about\n\fOct., 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 291\nthat class of phenomena, I send you herewith a narrative of the facts, think-\ning the case may interest you. I take the liberty of writing it in French, as\nI want to be sure of the correctness of my statements.\nGeorges Hulin.\nVers le commencement de I'hiver 1890-91, un jeune homme du nom de\nCharles-Louis^Casset, du village de Loo-ten-Hulle (Flandre Orientale), oil ma\nfamille a sa residence d'ete, annonga, pres de deux mois a I'avance, qu'il\namenerait au tirage au sort pour la milice, le numero 90 (on sait que le\nrecrutement de I'armee Beige se fait par voie de conscription). Plusieurs\npersonnes entendirent cette prediction, faite sur un ton de parfaite assurance,\net qu il renouvela devant le commissaire d'arrondissement presidant au\ntirage au sort. A la stupefaction g^nerale, ce numero sortit en effet.\nLe bruit en etant parvenu a nos oreilles, je voulus m'assurer de\nI'authenticite du fait, et interrogeai plusieurs personnes, entre autres la mere\ndu jeune homme. Tous m'affirmerent avoir entendu la prediction. Je\nm'adressai alors au commissaire d'arrondissement, M. van Dooren, qui\nme donna I'attestation ecrite que voici :\n. . . \"Cette annee-ci, le milicien Casset, Clis Ls, de Loo-ten-\nHulle, me demanda, avant de tirer, si le no 90 se trouvait encore dans\nI'urne ; sur ma reponse afBrmative il s'^cria :\n'\nC'est celui-la qu'il me faut !\n'\nAppele a tirer, il amena en efifet le numero 90.\n\" Le Commissaire d'Arrondissement,\n(Signe) \" JcLBS van Dooren.\"\nEn presence de ce temoignage officiel le doute n'etait plus permis. Tres-\nintrigue, je tachai de savoir comment le jeune homme avait eu ce pressenti-\nment,\nAu f)rintemps, quand mes parents furent retournes a Loo-ten-Hulle, je le\nfis venir ^i, la maison, et I'interrogeai. Jusque-la. il n'avait voulu repondre\nh, personne ; sans doute je lui inspirai plus de contiance, car, apres quelques\nhesitations, il me fit le recit suivant.\nComme la plupart des fils de petits cultivateurs, il avait grand peur du\nservice militaire, qui devait priver sa famille de son travail. Plusieurs mois\nd'avance il dtait done preoccupe et anxieux, et pensait constamment au jour\nfatal du tirage au sort.\nEnviron deux mois avant celui-ci, une nuit qu'il venait de se coucher, il\nvit dans un coin de sa chambre une forme indistincte, mais grande et elevee,\nde sorte que de son lit il devait lever les yeux pour la voir. La seule chose\nqu'il pouvait clairement percevoir, c'etait le chifFre 90 en grands caracteres,\n\" espaces d'environ un poing.\"\nII S3 souleva, ferma les yeux et les rouvrit pour bien s'assurer qu'il ne\nrevait point. L'apparition etait toujours la, aussi indeniable qu'au premier\nmoment. Saisi de frayeur, il se mit a prier, et ainsi, peu a peu, s'endormit.\nDes le premier moment il avait eu I'intuition que ce nombre 90 etait\ncelui qu'il tirerait et que c'etait un bon numero.\nA partir de cette nuit, il eut I'esprit tout-a-fait tranquille et dit a tous\nceux qui s'etonnaient de ce calme qu'il savait qu'il aurait le numero 90. On\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1894.\ncrufc d'abord a une plaisanterie, mais il affirmait cela avec tant de conviction\nque bientot il excita la curiosity.\nComme je lui demandais s'il avait dans sa vie eu d'autres visions, il me\ndit que non, mais que, apres la premiere apparition, 11 eut sou vent la meme\nvision, meme le jour, pendant son travail. II ajoutait judicieusement que ce\nn'etaient plus sans doute de vraies apparitions, mais seulement I'efFet de\nson imagination vivement frappee.\nCependant il croit avoir reelleraent revu I'apparition rri yst^rieuse dans la\nchambre ou se faisait le tirage au sort, avant de plonger la main dans le\ntambour. II dit au president qu'il etait inutile qu'il tirat, que son num^ro\n^tait 90. Le president lui rdpondit de ne pas plaisanter et de prendre un\nbillet. En tendant celui-ci au president, il repeta que c'etait 90.\nCe recit me fut fait avec un gran^i air de sincerite et de scrupuleuse\nexactitude. Le jeune homme, qui semble doux et intelligent, parlait k voix\nbasse avec une emotion visible, et me demanda de ne rien dire aux autres\nhabitants du village. II croit evidemment a une intervention surnaturelle.\nJe m'adressai encore au commissaire d'arrondissement pour lui\ndemander s'il se rappelait d'autres cas nu des miliciens avaient predit le\nnnni^ro qu'ils tireraient. A cette epoque (1891) il ne s'en rajapelait qu'un\nseul, qu'il voulut bien me certifier par ecrit en meme temps que celui\nrapporte plus haute :\n\" en 1886, au tirage au sort a Eedoo, le milicien Masca\n(Ferdinand), de cette ville, m'a declare, avant le tirage, qu'il amenerait le\nno 112, ce qui fut vrai.\"\nDepuis, il m'a signale trois autres cas : I'hiver dernier ou le precedent (sa\nlettre n'est malheureusement pas datee, et mes souvenirs ne sont pas precis\nsur ce point), il m'ecrivait ce qui suit :\n\" Un fait bizarre et digne d'etre racont^ s'est produit mercredi dernier\nau tirage au sort pour la milice a Maldeghem.

Dream.\nRossljni Cottage, Pilgrim's Lane, Hampstead, July 2oth, 1894.\nOn Monday morning, at about 8 o'clock, Arthur got up and went to call\nPhdip whom he woke out of a sound sleep. Philip's door is nearly opposite\nours, and I heard them laughing, and called out to know what the joke\nwas. Arthur came back and told me Philip had had an absurd dream\nthat the President Carnot had been assassinated. I said I saw nothing\n\"funny\" in that, and he answered, \"Oh! the joke was that he dreamed\nthat M R (a young Frenchman who lives m Hampstead) had\nannounced the news, adding that he expected to be elected President,\" at\nwliich we aU three laughed agaua.\nArthur dressed and in about half-an-hour went down-stah's, rushing up\nagain almost immediately, shouting to Phil (whose door was then locked)\n\" He is assassinated,\" and pointing out the announcement in large print in\nthe Daily JSleivs.\nA strange part of it is that Philip takes little or no interest m politics of\nany kind, and declares that, to the best of his recollection, Carnot's name\nhas not been mentioned m his hearing.

Dream.\nFrom Miss Robertson, 1, Oakley-street, Chelsea.\nSunday, June 24:th, 1894.\nI slept badly last night. I went to sleep about 2 a.m., and woke about\n4. Got up and went into my sitting-room. Went back and slept from about\n5.30 to 7.30, when the servant awoke me by coming upstairs, but not into\n\f294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1894.\nmy room. I then remembered that some one had said to me in the night,\n\"The Duchess of York is confined, and the child is a boy.\" I had also\ndreamed some nonsense about the child's title ; that he was to be called\n\"Chevalier\" or to be made a baronet. This was probably the result of\nsomething I had been reading in an Italian book last night. I remember\nthe sentence ;\n\" Moriro cavaliere, e il mio destino.\" I thought of getting\nmy diary, or going to tell my mother, but was lazy and incredulous. At 8\nthe servant brought my breakfast and the Sunday Times, which my mother\nhad cut, hut not opened. I thought no more of my dream, but began the\npaper at the first page, and found the news on the fifth page. I had not\nexpected the paper, or I should really have told my mother my dream. The\nnewspaper had come to the house about 7.30, and had not been looked at by\nanyone. I should say that I had no idea when the confinement was\nexpected, whether this month or next, and had thought as little about the\nmatter as well could be ;\nbeing quite easy in my mind about the succession.\nNoEA Robertson.\nIn this case it is of course possible that the percipient might\nonce have known what the probable date of the event would be,\nand have retained an unconscious memory of it, though perhaps her\nwant of interest in the subject of her dream makes this an im-\nprobable explanation. The following experience, which occurred to\nMiss Robertson a few days earlier than the above, seems worth\ngiving in connexion with it.\nJuly 21th [1894.]\nDuring this summer I have been teaching English to an Italian friend.\nHe had the habit of jotting down questions, idioms, or odd words on backs\nof letters and cards, and bringing them to me for explanation.\nOn the night of July 11th or 12th I was on the point of falling asleep\n(about 11 or 11.30), when I was roused by hearing my friend ask me, \"What\nis a detached house 1 What is the Italian for a detached house ?\" The\nquestion woke me entirely, and after some thought I decided that \" casa\nstaceata \" was the proper translation. I then went to sleep. I am not sure\nthat it was on the next day, or the day after, that my friend brought me a\nlist of eight or ten questions.

(See\nProceedings S. P, R., Part XXVI, pp. 83\u201492). The percipient's\nname was given us in confidence. The account was written in the\nearly part of 1892.\nWednesday, November 18th [1891], I was lying on a sofa about 2\np.m. in half doze, when my thoughts reverted to Southsea, where I had\nspent about a fortnight in .June last. A mental picture, realistic enough\nalmost for a dream, of the animation and stir of the pier and steamboats\ninterested me, when all at once my mind became absorbed with the\nconception of a barge-like vessel with diving apparatus engaged in some\nsubmarine work. The impression of something being wrong, with a hurried\nagitated effort to raise a diver from the water, impressed me. There\nseemed to be a difficulty in working the winding-up machine, and in my\ndream, or semi-dream, I was excited with the fear that they would fail to\nget the diver up alive through the apparent hitch. At last, in my\nreverie, they succeeded in raismg him, and then, as if I were in the\nbarge, I seemed to see the helmet removed, and the diver was dead. I\nthought no more of the matter except as a rather peculiar instance of a half-\nawake dream. But the next day, when reading the Daily News, I was\nstartled on coming across a paragraph stating in effect that \"yesterday\nmorning \" (the day of my mental impression, dream, or call it what you\nwill), whilst a diving party were engaged in doing something to some chain\nmoorings in Portsmouth Harbour, the diver got probably in some way\nentangled, and signalled to be taken up. The effort was at once made to do\nso, but considerable delay was occasioned by the supposed obstacle, and\nwhen at last he was brought to the surface he was quite dead, black in the\nface, and blood oozing from his mouth and nostrils. Struck with the at\nleast remarkable coincidence, I read the paragraph to my wife and a lady\nwho was present, as answering so precisely in every particular to my mental\nimpression of the previous day, which could not have been more than three\nor four hours at [most] from the time the accident actually occurred.\nThe lady through whom the case was received writes :\n\u2014\nMay mh, 1892.\nI called upon Mr. , and he said that he had not mentioned his dream\n(or vision) to any one until some hours afterwards, when the newspaper came\nin. A Miss -, an elderly lady who was present when I called, said that she\nwas also there when the newspaper came in, and remembered his exclamation\nof surprise and his saying '\n' Why, this is the very thing I dreamed of yester-\nday,\" or some words of that sort.\nThe following is the account of the incident given in the Daily\nNews of Thursday, Nov. 19th, 1891.\nDeath of a Diver on Duty. \u2014Yesterday morning a party of men\nwere engaged in repairing the moorings of the Corporation Buoy in Ports-\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

As soon as\npossible he was conveyed to the Harbour Railway Station, where he was\nfound to be dead.\nACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS IN APPARENT\nCLAIRVOYANCE.\nBy Michael Petrovo-Solovovo.\nThe experiments I am going to describe took place on June 7th\nand 9th, 1894, with a lady whom\u2014as she is most anxious to con-\nceal her identity\u2014I shall call M^i^ P.*. Slie lives generally at S.,*\na town in the South East of Russia, where\u2014being subject to attacks\nof hystero-epilepsy\u2014she is one of the inmates of the local Asylum for\nincurable patients. I understand that such attacks were much more\nsevere and more frequent before (as many, in fact, as ninety in the\ncourse of a single month !), and that her sufferings were greatly re-\nlieved by Dr. Hovrin, one of the physicians at the S. hospital, who\ntried the effect of suggestion on her for the iirst time several years\nago, and who has taken care of her ever since.\nIt was Dr. Hovrin, I believe, who was the first to assert the exist-\nence in Mile P. of supernormal powers, and ever since he made,\nor thought he made, this discovery he has been trying to call the\nattention of all competent persons to the alleged phenomena. So far\nas I know, his efforts have been to a certain - extent successful, and\njyXUe p_'s name is now known in Russia to many persons having\nno direct connexion with her and her physician. However, it is not\nmy purpose to discuss the evidence for her \" clairvoyance \" or to relate\nprevious experiments\u2014concerning which I know but little. I wish to\ndescribe only what I saw myself and should have left out all these\ndetails altogether were it not necessary to account for the presence at\nthe sittings of a third or fourth person\u2014Dr. Hovrin. The time may\npossibly come for a general examination and discussion of all the\navailable evidence for M^^ p.'s clairvoyance ; but it is clear to me\n\u2014and to some others\u2014that it has not come yet. M'le P. is also\nanxious that it should not be stated in print why she and her physician\ncame to Petersburg from S., and so I can only say, without giving any\nnames, that it was at the desire of a most distinguished personage who\n* Both initial.s are fictitious.\n\fOct., 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 297\nhad heard of M^^^ P.'s alleged powers, and was anxious to see her\nand have the matter investigated. Some experiments were therefore\narranged and made\u2014at which, however, he was not generally present.\nThe results are not yec known to me, tliough so far as I know, they\nmust have been inconclusive either way ;\nand, as the trials were but\nfew, will probably never appear in print, and have no bearing on the\nbona fides of the \" subject,\" I shall do nothing but mention them.\nI made M^^^ P.'s acquaintance towards the end of her stay in\nPetersburg, which was undoubtedly unfortunate. She at once showed\nan entire willingness to give me the opportunity of witnessing\npersonally her phenomena, and I met with the same readiness and\ncourtesy in Dr. Hovrin, to both of whom I wish to express my\nsincerest thanks for their kindness. I must also mention that M^'^ P.\nproduced on me a most favourable impression from the very be-\nainning, and that I believe her to be honest and intelligent. As for\nDr. Hovrin, all that I can say is that it would be a perfect insult to\nhim to discuss the question of his honesty and veracity, and that,\nbesides, he deserves the sympathy of every student of \"psychics\n\"\nfor his constant endeavours to call the attention of the scientific world\nto the matter, and his efibrts to secure for the experiments the strictest\nand most conclusive conditions possible.\nI now proceed to give the details of the experiments.\nReport of Sittings.\n(From notes taken at the time, and an account of the first sitting written\non the next day.\n)\nSitting I.\nI called on Ml'e p. and her physician, Dr. Hovrin, at 1.30 p.m. on\nThursday, 7tli of June. I saw Dr. Hovrin first. He said to me that his\npatient, MUe p., had been ill all the time. He therefore much doubted\nif the experiments would succeed. It was, however, decided to try some.\nI had brought with me five or six glass tubes with silk of difi'erent colours\nbought on the same day and carefully stopped. Dr. Hovrin, however, called\nmy attention to the fact that it would be perhaps difficult to define the\ncolour of the silk, the shades being too complex, and proposed to try aniline\ninstead, to which I consented. He had in his possession severaltubes\nalready filled (and used in previous experiments referred to in the introduc-\ntion) : we emptied them first and then filled them again\u2014each glass tube\nwith a different colour of aniline from the one previously used, I believe,\nafter which I wrapped them up in paper. M'le p. was then asked to\ncome in. She said she was ill and undoubtedly looked so. I therefore\n:\nsuggested postponing the experiments, but on reflection we decided to see\nwhat could be done under these unfavourable conditions. As a first trial,\nMile p. sitting with her back to the light and lier hands beliind her back\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1894.\nand covered with her shawl, I gave her one of the glass tubes to hold.\nThis experiment was a failure :\nMl'e p. did not see anything.\nWe then decided to make an experiment, of which I had already heard,\nin the case of M^e p., similar to one often made by tlie late Dr. Charcot,\nbut under peculiar conditions, which in Dr. Hovrin's opinion tended to dis-\nprove Charcot's poinU de repere theory. I took nine or ten loose sheets of\nwriting paper (middle size, rough surface) out of a very great number pre-\nviously brought by Dr.Hovrin (among which was a whole unopened packet)\nchose one of them and marked it with a very faint pencil mark ;\nthen a\npiece of cuhnmid paper (blue or violet) was placed on the immarTted surface,\nand the whole covered with a double sheet of cigarette-paper, so that nothing,\nbut the general shape and colour of the leaf were visible. M^e P.\nthen came in \u2014having remained out of the room all the time\u2014 and Dr.\nHovrin suggested to her (as always in the normal state) that she would\nalways see this bins mark on this very same sheet of paper. After having\nlooked at it for some time MUe P. was asked by me to leave the room,\nand I put the selected sheet of paper back among the rest and shufHed them\nall. Mile p. then tried to find it and failed. Here unfortunately my\nnotes are not clear, but if my memory does not deceive me, the experiment\nwas then repeated, and this time successfully.\nI cannot lay much stress on the following experiment, in which the\n\"subject \"was told to see a hallucinatory portrait of myself on a blank\npage, uncovered, and which succeeded, for it is obvious that under such con-\nditions Charcot's theory holds good, the more so as MUe P. and myself\nwere sitting near the window; but the following circumstance was interesting.\nThis experiment was repeated three times, and the percipient said twice\nthat she saw my portrait npside down, which (on referring to my pencil\nmark on the other side of the page) I each time found to be correct. To\nverify this curious circumstance, I retired into the adjoining room and\nturned the leaf up and down several times ; and then, not knowing myself\nwhich way was my \" head \" and which way my \" feet,\" I came back and\nshowed the leaf to MUe P., who gave a correct answer at once (which I\ncould of course verify by referring to my pencil mark). I repeated this ex-\nperiment twelve times, and in no case did MUe p. make a single mistake,\nrecognising at once where the \" head \" or \" feet \" were ; and I can say\nthat the impression produced on me was that she really saio a hallucinatory\nimage, and that hypertesthesia of sight had nothing to do with the matter.\nIt must be added that MUe P. never touched the sheet, which I generally\nplaced on a chair, I should say, at a distance of one and a-half metre from\nher face, and that besides, in most cases, I could not have given any uncon-\nscious hidication, not knowing myself whether my \" portrait \" was turned\nupside down or not.\nThis looked decidedly encouraging, and so we decided to try the experi-\nment again, with the selected sheet covered ; and this time successfully. This,\nresult I consider remarkable, for it must be understood that every precau-\ntion was taken to prevent MUe p. from seeing the sheet micovered, and\nthat, as I have said before, under these conditions nothing but the general\nshape and colour of the leaf were visible. It will be remembered that a\n\fOct., 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\ntriangle cut out of a piece of violet paper had been placed on the .selected\nsheet before being covered with cigarette-paper. On a .second trial the same\nexperiment was a failure, but was then repeated a third time\u2014and this\ntime successfully, M^e P. also correctly indicating whicli way the\nhallucinatory triangle was turned. I felt greatly interested in this latter\ncircumstance\u2014 the percipient correctly indicating the position of the\nhallucinatory image -and verified it by a new series of trials similar to\nthose I have already described, with the same precautions and as success-\nfully as before. We then decided to test M^e P.'s supernormal percep-\ntion of colours, using the glass tubes we had prepared, with the following\nresults :\n\u2014\nColour cJiosen. Colour seen.\n(i.e., glass tube prepared by Dr. (on a wMe counterpane).\nH. and myself.) The percipient did not see any-\nWhite, thing and said so. (According\nto Dr. H. white always produces\nthis effect on M^e P.)\nQi-een The percipient saw \"yellowspots.\"\nRed. Red.\nBlue. Blue.\nIn these experiments MUe P. always left the room before I had\nchosen, or taken at random (in the first two cases), the tubes (which, it will be\nremembered, were wrapped in paper), and I am perfectly certain that in no\ncase did she see the colour normally. As for tlie way in which we pro-\nceeded for these trials, it was as follows : P. and Dr. Hovrin had\nin their possession a large box hermetically closed with the exception of\ntwo openings, one opposite the other, to which were adjusted what I shall\ncall for want of a better term two sleeves made of cloth. When M^e P.\nwas out of the room I took one of the tubes, and holding it in my hand\nthrust my arm through one of the sleeves into the box, and after M^e P.\nhad come back she put one arm into the box through the other opening, and\nI then gave her the glass tube to hold, which she continued to do till the end\nof the experiment. It is obvious that under such conditions the possibility\nof M'le P. knowing the colour through the sense of sight was practically\nexcluded. I watched her all the time, and am positive that normal sight had\nnothing to do with the result. And the box was certainly not a trick box,\nhaving been specially made for the experiments referred to in the inti-o-\nduction.\nOwing to the percipient feeling tired the seance here ended. It was for\nthe same reason that but a limited number of experiments were made. ^\nI\nasked M^^ P. to give me a second sitting if possible, to which she readily\nconsented, and on June 9th we had a\nSecond Sitting,\nat which, besides myself, my wife was present.\nThe conditions were apparently as unfavourable as on the first day, in view\nof the fact that M^e P. persisted in complaining of her health being very\npoor. Still some undoubtedly curious results were obtained.\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1894.\nAt first the portrait experiment was rejDeated (the selected sheet of paper\nbeing uncovered) and succeeded quite well. As I have said before, however,\na certain acuteness of sight is sufficient to account for the result. At the\nsame time, my wife reminds me that while Dr. Hovrin was making the\nnecessary suggestion to M^e p. she looked much more on my wife (whose\nportrait she was to see) than on the blank page lying before her on the\n-window-sill. Dr. Hovrin had said to me during the first sitting that M^e p.\ncould also find out whether a glass of water had been held for some time\nin the right or in the left hand by simply tasting the water. He and M^e P.\n\u2022said tliis was an experiment which nearly always succeeded, and which\nwas made for the first time by Baron Reichenbach. In our case, however,\nno couclusive results were obtained, as we had two failures and three\nsuccesses. T may mention that we had brought our own glasses, which\nlooked precisely similar, and took all necessary precautions, going into\nanother room to hold the glasses of water\u2014one in each hand\u2014for five\nminutes, but it is unnecessary to give more details, the results being\nunsatisfactory\n.\nSome colour-experiments were then tried, Dr. Hovrin and myself going\nout of the room to fill the glass tubes with aniline. I am not certain\nwhether this time my own glass tubes or Dr. Hovrin 's were used, but this\nis (if little importance, as in any case no glass tubes prepared by Dr. Hovrin\nbefore the sitting and in my absence were used, and we did all the work of\nfilling the tubes, &c., in the same room and at the same time.\nThe conditions were' the same as at the first sitting, Mile p. holding\nthe tube in the box. She twice said the colour was blue when it was lilac,\nwhich certainly is rather good. She saio the colour on a white counter-\npane spread at some distance in front of her.\nMy wife was much interested, and Dr. Hovrin said that in his opinion\nmany persons must be able to do the same and asked her to try. She now\nput one hand into the box and I gave her\u2014through the other opening \u2014\na\npiece of red paper to hold. She looked at the counterpane and soon said\nshe saw something red. M^e P., who was sitting near said the colour\nwas orange. This looked encouraging, but on a second trial my wife said the\ncolour was blue, MUe p. saying she saw the same colour, whilst I had\ngiven my wife the same piece of red jDaper to hold. And a third experi-\nment\u2014with my wife guessing alone, I think\u2014was equally unsuccessful.\nDr. Hovrin then suggested to M'le p. \u2014I again use the word \"sug-\ngested,\" but she was, as always, wideawake\u2014to see a hallucinatory jjortraitof\nhimself on a sheet of paper (chosen by my wife and privately marked by her\non the under side) covered with a double sheet of cigarette paper. This\nexperiment was a perfect success, the percipient also correctly indicating\nwhich way the portrait was turned. My wife \u2014to whom I had spoken about\nthis experiment before the seance, and who had been very sceptical on the\nsubject\u2014was greatly surprised. There were nine sheets of paper in all ;\nmy\nwife shuffled them herself, and M^^e p. was called back only when this\nwas done. At the first seance\u2014and I think during the very first of the\nportrait-experiments\u2014I noticed that Mile P. sometimes placed one leaf\npartly upon the other, so that owing to the semi-transparency of the paper\n\fOct., 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychiecd Research. 301\nthe pencil-mark could perhaps become faintly visible ; I pointed it out to\nher, and she carefully avoided doing the same afterwards. I therefore find\nno flaw in the experiment I have just described.\nWhat followed was also good, though less conclusive. Dr. Hovrin and I\nwent out of the room, MUe P. remaining with my wife, and prepared four\nsolutions of citric acid, sugar, salt and quinine. I then dipped a piece of thick\npaper into the preparation till it was thoroughly imbibed with it, and then\nplaced the piece of paper upon the percipient's bare fore-arm. M^e P.\nsaid that in such experiments she felt the peculiar taste in her mouth.\nFour trials were made ; at first the percipient could not make out any taste-\n(we had been taking tea just before). The second experiment was a success,,\nthe percipient saying she felt the taste of salt, which was correct ; the third\na failure (\"something sweet\" instead of quinine), and the fourth a\nsuccess again (salt). In one of the successful cases, at least, I had taken one\nof the four bottles containing the solutions at random, not knowing my-\nself whether I was imbibing the piece of paper with something sweet, salt,\nbitter or acid ; so that even thought-transference is here out of the ques-\ntion. I say this because towards the end of the sitting we had some\nindications that it would be worth while to try telepathic experiments\nwith Mile p.\nThe percipient felt tired, but unfortunately I was anxious to witness\none more experiment with a hallucinatory image on a covered sheet and.\nasked MUe P. to try. This she did, but with no success : she did not\nfind out the right sheet, but pointed out two wrong ones instead. I doubt,\nhowever, whether it is quite fair to take this experiment into account,\nseeing that the percipient was obviously very tired.\nTowards the end of the sitting we mentioned to Dr. Hovrin and\nMile- P. the experiments of some members of the English S.P.R. on\nthe telepathic transference of tastes. They felt interested, and Dr. H.,\nretiring behind a screen in the same room, asked MUe P. what he\nwas tasting. She said it was something acid, which was correct, as he was\ntasting citric acid. Two experiments on the telepathic transference of\ncolours made by myself were also partly successful. I first took some\nred silk, and the percipient said she saw something red (on a sheet of\npaper held before her by my wife). I then chose some green silk and\nMile P. said \"blue.\" (According to Dr. H. and herself she always\nmistakes one colour for the other.)\nThe seance here ended, and M^e P. and her physician having left for\nS. a few days after, I had no other opportunity of seeing them.\nStatement by Madame Petrovo-Solovovo.\nI certify that my husband's account of what happened at the second\nseance is strictly accurate. I was greatly impressed by the successful portrait-\nexperiment, the more so, as I had been showing my husband the day\nbefore what could be done in that line with a certain acuteness of sight. I\nalso wish to point out that when I was guessing the colours, MUe P. did\nnot hold the piece of paper at all, so that her remarks had better not be\ntaken into account. She impressed me as being a thoroughly honest person\n.\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Still, taken as they are, the\nresults look certainly encouraging (especially in view of the\npercipient's bad health at the time), and Dr. Hovrin's ' subject\n\"\nundoubtedly deserves careful attention. It is possible that at some\nfuture time I may be able to renew these experiments with MH\"^ P.,\nand I have besides some reason to believe that other observers more\ncompetent than myself are beginning to interest themselves in\nM\"!\u00ae P. At the same time, and while thinking that the results I\nobtained are interesting and encouraging, I certainly do not claim\nthat they j)rove the existence of such a faculty as clairvoyance. They\nconstitute at best but one more link in the chain of evidence tending to\nestablish lucidity or second sight as a fact\u2014which to my mind is not\nquite conclusive.\nMichael Petrovo-Solovovo.\n38, Serghievskaia, St. Petersburg.\nJuly \\Zth, 1894.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\\Tlie Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed hy Correspondents.'\\\nanthropology and psychical research.\nMr. Leaf, in reviewing my book, Cock Lane and Common Sense,\n\"has made an emendation which I gladly accept. Mr. Tylor has argued that\nthe undesigned coincidence of testimony, from all ages and places, demon-\nstrates the existence of many odd institutions, as Totemism and the\nCouvade, which we might regard as mere travellers' tales, if the accounts\n-were less uniform and persistent. For it is plain that we cannot cross-\nexamine Herodotus, Marco Polo, Sahagun, and Francesco de Avila. Finding,\nhowever, that they report from various quarters what Australian and\nAfrican explorers (ignorant of their works) report from others, we discover\nevidence in the undesigned consensus, especially as many of the queer\nthings described actually exist, and may be studied by travellers to-day.\n1 argued that the evidence for clairvoyance, levitations, death-wraiths,\nand so on, in savage and in ancient countries, was of the same character,\nand was valid in the same way. But Mr. Leaf justly remarks that the\nevidence is not testimony to the fact of supernatural phenomena, but to the\nbelief in the fact. This is perfectly true, and I have made the correction\nfor a new edition. When we can establish a fact here and now, it reflects\ncredit on the alleged fact in Kamschatka or ancient Rome. Thus, if\niscience admits (as I presume it will soon admit) that a few people can see\nhallucinatory pictures in crystals, then savage and ancient practices analogous\n\f\u2022Oct., 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 303\nto crystal-gazing may be regarded as based on a fact \u2014that of self-hallucina-\ntion. Further we cannot logically go. Yet the mere existence of this one\ncase does, perhaps unreasonably, strengthen my opinion that, behind the\nother savage and ancient tales of clairvoyance, death-wraiths, movements of\n\u2022objects, we may also suspect the existence of supernormal facts, or facts of\nsome kind, hallucinatory, or the result of imposture. We have not to deal,\nI think, with mere imaginative mythology. The mental conditions of\n-Catholic devotees, or savages, are not the mental conditions of Mr. Crookes,\nMr. Hamilton Aide, and other observers of D. D. Home. Our con-\ntemporaries, if they fabled, would hardly fable exactly as Australians\nfable. Some fact there is, of hallucination (and then wo ask, what force\ncauses the identity of hallucination ?), of imposture (and then we ask, how\nis it worked ?) or of supernormal truth.\nNow, in examining these alternatives I do continue to think that\nthe anthropological and comparative method is valid. I have shewn\nthat the impressions made on witnesses are everywhere and always\nidentical, They are, therefore, independent of conditions specially savage,\nspecially religious, \u2014whatever the religion may be. Gnostic, Covenanting,\nCatholic, barbaric. Consequently anthropologists like Mr. Im Thurn, or Mr.\nTregear, mmj discover the secret in New Guinea, or among Maoris, or\nPawnees ; at all events the study is one in human nature, and therefore\nlegitimate. An observation among Zulus or Bushmen may explain Home\nor Stainton Moses.\nI am unable to see that all this examination of facts or fancies remote in\nspace or time deserves to be shelved, till some persons here and now are\nconvinced that they have demonstrated the fact of clairvoyance, or what\nnot. We should pursue our research everywhere, in experience, and in\ndocuments. Though I do not exactly accuse the Society for Psychical\nResearch of ignorance in the history of their subject, I certainly have seen\nlittle exhibition of knowledge, except in Mr. Gurney's note on witchcraft,\nMr. Myers's essay on oracles, and Miss X's remarks on crystal gazing. If\nthe society were of my mind they would issue, like the Anthropological\nSociety, a kind of catechism on their special themes, for the use of travellers\nand missionaries. Letters from travellers have lately made me aware that\nHome's fire-handling trick, (known to lamblichus and the Hurons) is familiar\nto Fijians, Bulgarians, and to some of the aboriginal races of India, and to\nthe tribes of Northern Asia. Probably there are many other examples. Are\nwe to neglect them till people are satisiied (by what evidence I cannot guess)\nthat the thing can be done here and now ? Historical research had, long\nago, indicated the existence of the belief in the power, as in the New Testa-\nment. We find the power vouched for by Lord Crawford and others, so why\nnot investigate savage instances in actual experience and in documents ?\nThis is the anthropological method. Why should Anthrojjology wait ?\nWhy are the stories told, and told uniformly 1 We have discounted the\nmere mythopoeic explanation.

All the\nsavages in the world would not convince me, by an unanimous vote, but I think\nwe should hear what they have to say. For their psychology, uncorrected by\nobserved facts, would not lead them to believe in death- wraiths, but the\nreverse : dreams being much more common than death.

I do not know who Mr. Z. is, and I have no admiration for his\nfooling ; but I am bound to say that a reading of the paper rather\nstrengthens my opinion that it is a case of fooling and not of fraud.\nYours truly, J. Page Hopps.\nMr. Page Hopps' distinction between \"fooling\" and \"fraud \" reminds'\nme of the story of the man Avho was found carrying a sheep at some distance\nfrom the flock to which it belonged. When discovered, he said it was \"a\njoke,\" but a jury decided that he had carried the joke too far, and the\nunfortunate humourist had to suffer the penalty of sheep-stealing.\nIt is comparatively unimportant whether the motive actuating Mr. Z. was\na desire to test the penetration of psychical researchers, or some more\nvulgar impulse. The important point is that two witnesses, on two separate\noccasions, at an interval of seven months, observed him raising by instru\nments a table that he was supposed to be raising supernormally, and that,\nsubsequently to the second occasion, he solemnly declared that the phe-\nnomena had not been \"produced by normal means.\" There is therefore\nevery reason to suppose that the whole series of his performances, carried on\nfor some years, was a piece of systematic deception, which he never intended\nto reveal.\nHenry Sidgwick.\n\fNo. CXIV.\u2014Vol. VI.

[Nov., 1894.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nA Meeting of the Council was held at the Westminster Town Hall,\non October 26th, Dr. W. Leaf in the chair. There were also present\nProfessors O. J. Lodge, W. Ramsay, and H. Sidgwick, Dr. J. Milne\nBramwell, and Messrs. T. Barkworth, W. Crookes, F. W. H. Myers,\nF. Podmore, S. C. Scott and H. A.

Eleven new Associates\nwere elected. The election of one new Member and four new\nAssociates of the American Branch was recorded. The names and\naddresses are given above. It was agreed that the Proceedings be\nsent to Dr. G. B. Ermacora, of Padua, in exchange for a new Journal\nwhich he is bringing out, and that an arrangement be made by\nwhich Members and Associates may be able to obtain the new Journal\nat a reduced rate, as is the case with the Annales des Sciences\nPsychiques.\nVarious other matters having been disposed of, the next meeting\nof the Council was fixed for Friday, December the 7th, at 4.30 p.m.,\nat 19, Buckingham Street, W.C.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 68th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West-\nminster Town Hall on Friday, October 26th, at 4 p. m., Professor\nSidgwick in the chair.\nProfessor Lodge gave the substance of the paper which\nfollows.\nEXPERIENCE OF UNUSUAL PHYSICAL PHENOMENA\nOCCURRING IN THE PRESENCE OF AN ENTRANCED\nPERSON (EUSAPIA PALADINO).\nReport to the President and Council of the S.P.R.\nBy Oliver J. Lodge, D.Sc.\nActing upon an invitation from Professor Charles Richet, I visited\nhis island in the Mediterranean, (the smallest of the group off the coast\nnear Hy^res), in order to witness the physical phenomena asserted\nto occur in the presence of an uneducated Neapolitan woman, Eusapia\nPaladino; and I remained there 6 days, viz., from 21st to 27th July,\n1894 in company with my friend Mr. F. W. H. Myers, and another\n\fmv., 1894.] Report on Eusapia Paladino. 307\nguest of Prof. Richet, viz., Dr. J. Ochorowicz,i of Warsaw, known for\nhis researches and writings on hypnotism and allied conditions. There\nwas also staying in the house, part of the time, a private secretary of\nProf. Richet's, a M. Bellier, who took down the contemporary notes of\n-the seances as dictated to him through a window, but who was not in\nthe room at the time and took no part in the observations or control.\nAfter his departure his place as note-taker was occupied by Dr.\nOchorowicz.\nAt this visit we had four sittings, as nearly as possible on alternate\ndays, each lasting about three or four hours on the average. At the\nlast two sittings I myself arranged the furniture and objects in the\nroom before the sitting, and can testify that they were not interfered\nwith by anyone entering the room.\nA month later I again visited Prof. Ptichet, who was now at his\nchateau, at Carqueiranne, near Toulon ; I stayed there from August\n22nd to September 5th with my wife, and witnessed six more sittings,\nthis time in conjunction with Prof, and Mrs. Sidgwick. During this\nsecond series Dr. Ochorowicz and another friend of Prof. Richet's, M.\nBerretta, were present part of the time, i.e., until they departed to\nParis ; Dr. Freiherr von Schrenck Notzing, of Munich, and Dr. Charles\nSegard,2 chief medical officer of the French Mediterranean Fleet, were\neach present at two sittings; and at all except two my wife acted as\nnote-taker, in place of M. Relliei', who was too ill to come. I shall\nleave a detailed account of this second series of sittings to Prof, and\nMrs. Sidgwick, and shall myself, except when specially stated, refer\nonly to the experience gained in the first series.\nI had once or twice previously \" assisted \" at attempts to observe\nabnormal physical phenomena, but never with any success. The\nthings then obtained did not satisfy me of their genuineness. The\noccurrences alleged by previous witnesses-'' to take place in presence\nof Eusapia were of a more highly developed order than any I had\nseen attempted, though they did not pretend to be of so elevated a\ncharacter as those recorded by Mr. Stainton Moses and his friends.\nI went in a state of scepticism as to the reality of physical movements\nproduced without apparent contact, but this scepticism has been over-\nborne by facts.\nI have now definitely to state my conviction that certain\n1 Ex-Professor of Psychology and Natural Philosophy in the University of\nLemberg ; author of \" La Suggestion Mentale.\"\n3 Medecin principal de la Marine, Medecin en chef de I'Escadre de la Mediterranee.\n3 See, for instance, Mr. Podmore's account of experiments in 1892, by a scientific\n\u2022committee at Milan, Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXIV., Vol. IX., p. 218.\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894. j\nphenomena of this class may, under certain conditions, have a\nreal and objective existence.\nPreliminary Details.\nThe experiments were conducted at night, from about 10 p.m. to\n1 a.m., after the servants had retired into a separate cottage. They\noccurred in a small sitting-room on the ground-floor of Professor\nRichet's house\u2014the only house on the island except the lighthouse\u2014 a\nroom, 21ft. by 16ft., with plain stucco walls, with only one door (which\non most occasions I kept locked), and with two hinge-shuttered\nwindows facing south and opening on to a verandah. The shutters\nwere fastened without being quite closed ; a long narrow aperture\nbeing left for light and ventilation. (For plan of room see Appendix I.)\nOutside one of these windows, in the verandah, sat a note taker, who\nhad a lamp and a watch, and put down all that was dictated to him\nthrough the window ;\nresponding occasionally, so that his position was\nknown. Inside the room we observers sat round a table with Eusapia,\nin lamp-light at first, but afterwards in semi-darkness, conversing in\nan ordinary manner. In a very short time the table at which we\nsat became restless and occasionally rose completely from the floor ;\nafter about half an hour or so of miscellaneous movements the lamp\nwas lowered and Eusapia was accustomed to go into a light trance,\nwith an apparent loss of her ordinary normal consciousness ; and then\nbegan the more pronounced phenomena hereafter recorded. On three of\nthe four occasions now referred to, the sitters were Prof. Richet,\nMr. Myers, Dr. Ochorowicz, and myself, and the note-taker was M.\nBellier ; but on the fourth occasion M. Bellier had left the island and\nDr. Ochorowicz took his place. On the morning after a sitting we\nwrote an account of all that had occurred, using these notes as a basis,-\nand discussing all doubtful details with critical care. Excerpts from\nthis contemporary record will be given later (see Appendix) ; in it\ncertain terms are frequently used to avoid circumlocution, and these\nit is as well to define and use as technical terms.\nLarge Table. \u2014A structure of common deal of the simplest kind,\nspecially constructed without flange by M. Richet, consisting of a\nsquare top one inch thick and forty inches square, side boards also one\ninch thick and five inches broad ; four legs, one at each corner, thirty\ninches high, three inches square, bluntly pointed at the bottom so as to\nhurt a foot if an elfort were made to raise it thus. Weight, 48 lbs.\nSjnall Table.\u2014-A light oblong deal table at which we usually sat..\nIt measured 2ft. 9in. by 1ft. lOin. by 2ft. 4in. high, and weighed\nabout 181bs.\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eusapia Paladino. 309\nBound Table.\u2014An ordinary piece of mahogany furniture, 3ft. 9in.\ndiameter, covered with a cloth, and sustaining many of the things for\nexperiment.\nMedium. \u2014Name used in speaking of the person without whose\npresence none of the phenomena occurred. The name itself may be\nobjectionable as implying some hypothesis, but it is here used merely\n\u00ab,s a term in common use which it is difficult to avoid.\nTrance. \u2014Condition of the medium when the phenomena are best\ndeveloped, a condition not unlike the more obvious trance of Mrs.\nPiper, and involving some sort of different memory and different per-\nsonality to the ordinary one. When thoroughly in this state she is\nfound to answer best to the name of \"John\" instead of to her\n\u2022ordinary name ; but she still speaks only Italian, whenever she does\nspeak, in the trance. There are various grades of this trance, and\nunless it is thorough the phenomena are liable to be elementary and\nnot fully satisfactory.\nContact. \u2014When things are said to be moved without contact it is\nintended to assert that there is no contact with them of any ordinary\npart of the medium's body, nor of any part of the bodies of sitters, nor\nof any instrument or apparatus controlled by them. But that there\nmay be some kind of abnormal or unusual contact or link of connexion\nbetween moved bodies and the body of the medium seems to me at\npresent most probable.\nThe phrase \" without contact \" never means to exclude these\nhypothetical and abnormal kinds of contact.\nHand.\u2014The phrase \" grasped, or pinched, or pressed, or touched,\nor struck by a hand \" is intended to convey the idea of a sensation\nexperienced freely by the sitters, even before the trance fully comes on\n;\nespecially by those nearest Eusapia and who are controlling her limbs.\nSometimes the thing which produces the sensation is invisible, some-\ntimes it has been seen, and described as more or less like a hand,\nwith more or less of a foreai-m attached to it. Sometimes the grasps\nor pats are audible to other persons. Sometimes they are strong\nenough to be painful. It is not easy to describe them scientifically,\nbut a human hand, or pair of hands, can imitate and reproduce all\nthese sensations with perfect ease.\nChalet. \u2014Means a cigar-holding musical box, in shape of a little\nhouse, which must be wound up from below, and can be started to\nplay by twisting its chimney ; its doors then flap open, and it continues\nto play till they are shut or till it runs down. It was a toy that\nhappened to be there.\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov.,\nAccordio7t. \u2014An ordinary instrument belonging to Prof. Richetj.\n\u2022with no trick about it.\nSummary of Phenomena Observed.\nThe following is a summary of some of the things I have ex-\nperienced. (For fuller details see Appendix ; for explanation of terms,\nin inverted commas, see notes above.)\nI have been pushed, and also pinched or compressed, on the head\nand on the back, on the arm, and on the knees, while both \"the medium's\"\nhands were in my grasp, and her feet and head well controlled.\nUnder the same conditions I have had my hand grasped momen-\ntarily by something resembling a distinct^feeling bare hand, giving a\nclear impression of a thumb and finger and of nails.\nI have seen a large \" hand \" and other vaguer moving objects,\noutlined against the dim light of the night sky : the medium being in\nall cases carefully and completely held.\nI have seen a chair in the window several feet behind the com-\npletely controlled medium, and with no one near it, move several times-\nhorizontally, and also rise and knock on the floor.\nIn the total absence of wind I have seen the window-curtain (a.\ncurtain of heavy stuff with thick fringe) bulge out across the nearly\nclosed window as if some one were inside it, and continue bulged andl\noccasionally moving for some time ; the position of the medium at the\ntable, five feet away, being plainly obvious all the time, and nobody\nbeing concealed behind the curtain. On another occasion I have felt\nthe curtain flung over the table and sitters.\nI have seen the rude outline of a large face against the window-\nbackground, and a thing like a rough attempt at a hand move up to\nthe said face ;\n\"the medium \" being under perfect control and sufficiently\nvisible elsewhere. It appeared to me that the curtain and its fringe\nwere being used to make this imitation face ; and perhaps the simplest\nassumption in every case is that the visible appearances are mere re-\narrangements of already existing materials ; but that there was a pur-\nposive arrangement of matter was clear.\nI have heard a heavy table at which we were not sitting, and which\nno one was touching, move about many times, and then be turned bodily\nover, and when light was struck shortly afterwards have found it thus,\ninverted on the floor. It was the \" large table,\" weighing 48 lbs., and\nwe were sitting at the small table. It was overturned without\nundue violence, and so as not to break a voltaic battery and other\nthings on the floor near it. The gradual inversion of the table-\ncould be seen by Dr. Ochorowicz, who was more favourably situated for\n\fNov., 1S94.] Report on Eiisaina Paladino. 811\ncatching the faint light from the window on this occasion, but it was\ntoo dark for me to see.\nThe medium being under control as usual, I have several times\nheard \" the chalet \" being wound up at distances varying from one to\nfive feet away from the medium, and have heard and dimly seen\nit moving through the air, playing as it came. I have also felt it\ndeposited on my chest, and removed thence on to the table without\ncontact. ,-i\nI have heard some notes of \"the accordion\" sounded while it was\nlyino- on the round table, no one touching it, the position of both\nthe medium's hands being known to me, and not being anywhere near\nit. More recently (viz., during the second series of sittings) I have\nheard a sequence of several notes thus struck on a piano ;\nhands, arms\nfeet head, and mouth of medium being under perfect control, and\nthe nearest point of her body being two feet from the piano. The\nkeyboard was visible, but there was not enough light to see the depres-\nsion of the keys.\nI have heard raps on an untouched table, and once not only raps,\nbut bangs of excessive violence, as if made with a strongly-wielded\nmallet or an abnormally strong hand.\nI have seen little lights like glow-worms flit about for a short\ntime (others seeing them too).\nI have heard a sound as of the key being turned in the lock of the\nroom door, several feet distant, and with clear empty space between us\nand it The key then arrived on our table, and, after having been\ntouched by me, again entered the door, turned in the lock, once more\ncame into our hands and stayed there.\nI have seen writing in blue pencil done with a clean finger nail on\npaper, in candle-light.\nI have also seen sharply defined blue marks on a table surface\npreviously blank, no one having touched the table meanwhile, but the\nmedium's finger having been blued over purposely and moved appro-\npriately near but not touching the other side of the table.\nJ have twice seen a heavy table (48 lbs.) raised completely a foot\nfrom the ground, all standing round it\u2014hands and feet of medium\nheld both her hands on top of table, not near the edge ;\nthe fingers\nof one hand barelv touching, the fingers of the other lightly pressing,\nthe top of the table. It was normally impossible for the medium, even\nif released, to raise this table in her then position, viz., standing at\none corner, with her hands on the top ; as may be verified by any one\nwho will have a table made of the same dimensions. (See \"large\ntable\" above.) It does not seem to me feasible for her to raise the\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research- [Nov., 1894.\ntable in that position when controlled, even granting such hysterical\nincrease of her normal strength as we have some ground for conceding.\nI have heard her drinking as from a water bottle, which had\nbeen previously on the sideboard, and have afterwards felt the bottle\ndeposited upon the table, all standing round table, and all hands held.\nThe things for which I wish specially to vouch, as being the most\neasily and securely observed, and as being amply sufficient in themselves\nto establish a scientifically unrecognised truth, are (always under con-\nditions such as to prevent normal action on the part of the medium) ;\n\u2014\n(1) The movements of a distant chair, visible in the moonlight,\nunder circumstances such as to satisfy me that there was no direct\nmechanical connexion.\n(2) The distinct and persistent bulging and visible movement of a\nwindow-curtain in absence of wind or other ostensible cause.\n(3) The winding up and locomotion of the untouched chalet.\n(4) The sounding of the notes of the untouched accordion and\npiano.\n(5) The turning of the key on the inside of the sitting-room door,\nits removal on to the table, and subsequent replacement in door.\n(6) The audible movements and gradual inversion of an untouched\nheavy table, situated outside the circle ; and the finding it inverted\nafterwards.\n(7) The visible raising of a heavy table under conditions in which\nit would be ordinarily impossible to I'aise it.\n(8) The appearance of blue marks on a surface previously blank,\nwithout ostensible means of writing.\n(9) The graspings, pattings, and clutchings of my head, and arms,\nand back, while the head, and hands, and feet of the medium were\nunder complete control and nowhere near the places touched.\nIt may be convenient hereafter to arrange abnormal phenomena\nunder three heads or classes :\n\u2014\nClass A. \u2014Operations which are well within the ordinary power\nof the human body without previous preparation, if it were\nnot controlled or held so as to make it artificially powerless.\nClass 5.\u2014Operations which, though they may be within the\npower of the human body, cannot be performed without suitable\npreparation and manipulation.\nClass C. \u2014 Operations which are, ordinarily speaking, impossible.\nThe precise head under which any given occurrence is most con-\nveniently placed may be a matter of opinion, and would usually be of\nno great importance, but I may instance as belonging\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eusapia Paladino. 313\nTo Class A the following ;\n\u2014\nRaising and carrying of light objects such as chairs, keys,\ncandlesticks, boxes, water bottles, kc ;\n\"Winding-up of musical boxes, ringing of electric bells, and\nplaying of accordions ;\nTouching, pulling, and grasping of observers ;\nExhibition of hands or head.\nBelonging to Class B are such things as :\n\u2014\nRaising of heavy objects, beyond ordinary strength ;\nProduction of lights or of scent\n;\nExhibition of hands larger than those belonging to medium;\nWriting on distant objects, or writing without pencil\n;\nMovement of objects inside,\nor extraction of objects from a locked box.\nIn Class C we might place such things as :\n\u2014\nExtraction of objects from permanently closed box, or\nof matter from hermetically sealed tube ;\nTying of knots on endless string ;\nLinking together of two complete wooden rings ;\nSuspension of burning action of red hot bodies ;\nAdiabatic alteration of distribution of heat, in a bar or\nother bounded region, so as to change uniform into\nnon-uniform temperature without supply or withdrawal\nof heat\n;\nLocal concentration of a previously mixed solution in a\nsealed vessel.\nThings belonging to Class C have not yet been witnessed by me,\nnor, so far as I know, have they been asserted to occur in presence\nof E. P. Those in class B have been so asserted, but the occurrence\nof the last pair was in my case doubtful ; and for some of the others I\ndo not care to vouch. For instance, whether the hands seen and felt\nwere larger than those of the medium is a thing not easy to be sui-e of,\nin the absence of opportunity for actual measurement. I cannot say\nthat I have observed her do anything beyond what is possible to a\nfree and uncontrolled human being.\nThe events which happened during the sittings are stated in the\ncontemporary record, from which extracts are given in Appendix I.,\nand it will suffice here to say that the most ordinary language serves\nbest to describe the apparent phenomena ;\nthat is to say there seems\nnothing refined or subtle about the occurrences as a rule ; the things\nare moved much as they would be moved by hands, and the simplest\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov.. 1894.\nlanguage gives a very fair impression of the outer appearance of the\nphenomena as they appeal to one's senses at the time.\nSuch phrases as the following\u2014A chair in the window was now\nseen and heard to rise, to give 3 knocks, to approach several inches\nnearer, to move forcibly along the floor, to jerk up and down as if\nintelligently responding to a question ;\nor, the key in the door was now\nheard to turn and fidget in the lock and presently to make its\nappearance on the table, whence, after having been felt, it returned\nto the door and again entered the lock,\u2014such phrases may seem very\nabsurd but nevertheless they express what certainly occurs without\nany hypothesis, and until more is known about the cause I fail to see\nthat any more appropriate language can be used.\nIt would no doubt be possible to record all the movements of the\nchair by sufficiently elaborate apparatus, but it would be ingenuity\nthrown away. It is the fact of the movements which is interesting\nand surprising. A detailed description of them could hardly add\nmuch. The movements are characteristic of the action of a living\nbeing acting in unusual places and ways, but otherwise acting\nintelligently and capriciously just as live things do.\nSuppose a galvanometer began to exhibit strange and inexplicable\nmovements : it might at first occur to a physicist to note and record\nthem accurately, so as to trace their physical origin ;\nand in many\ncases that would be the proper thing to do. But as soon as it turned\nout that a blue-bottle fly was inside the case, he would cease to pay\nattention to the precise character of the movements. He would\nrecognise the capriciousness of a live thing. So it is in the seance-\nroom : things move precisely as if a live person were at large\n;\nand naturally the first hypothesis must be that such a person is.\nactually present. This hypothesis is the simple one of cheating on the\npart of someone:\n\u2014\n(1) Of the medium.\n(2) Of one or more of the sitters.\n(3) Of some outside person introduced for the purpose.\nTo guard against cheating on the part of the medium many\nprecautions were taken. Her feet were sometimes placed on an\napparatus, devised by M. Ochorowicz, which rings an electric bell\nif either foot is raised, and which was tested many times during a\nsitting to see that it was working well ; sometimes this apparatus was.\nreplaced by actual holding of the feet and legs. Her hands are\nheld, and often her head^ is held too, by one or more sitters.\n1 At the second series Professor Sidgwick specially attended to the position of the\nmouth on certain critical occasions, and took measuies to observe that no instrument\nwas held between the teeth ur otherwise.\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eiisapia Paladino. 315\nUsually the sitter on her right holds her right hand, and the sitter\non her left holds her left, the whole forearm being frequently\nheld as well as the hand. All this precautionary holding is entirely\nacquiesced in by the medium ; and before anything striking occurs\nshe usually calls attention to the position of each hand and foot\nseparately, and frequently places her head in contact with one or\nother of the sitters, so that its locahty may be known too. The sitters^\nwere well aware of the necessity for secure holding of the medium's\ngenuine hands and feet, and continually called out to each other as to\nthe security or otherwise of that portion of the body of the medium\nwhich they had in trust.\nFraud on the part of the medium is thus prevented, even if it were\ncontemplated ; and though we have no reason to suspect attempts at.\nfraud on the part of E. P. during our sittings, yet when a person is in.\na somnambulic or trance condition no confidence can be felt as to their\nactions, even by themselves. It is essential to take full and complete\nand continuous precaution of this kind, and such precautions were\ninvariably taken.'-\nIt is well also to remember that the arrival of a small object on the\ntable or floor in darkness is only valid as an abnormal event if the\nholding has been of unbroken continuity throughout. Practically it is\nunwise to consider this perfect continuity possible, hence no arrival of\nan object is considered trustworthy unless it is seen or heard coming,\nor unless it is too big or heavy or distant to admit of having been\nbrought near and concealed by the medium during some possible\nmoment of laxity, or unless its original situation has just previously\nbeen observed. The agency, whatever it is, whether the medium or\nsomething else, does not attempt to take observers by surprise, but-\nfrequently gives notice that something is going to happen, and\noccasionally indicates its nature beforehand, so that there may be no-\nlapse of attention to spoil the evidence during its occurrence. There\nis evidently a keen desire to make the evidence as good as possible. At\nthe same time there is a habit of requesting miscellaneous conversation\nbefore any specially energetic effort is made, especially before the^\n1 I hear it frequently said by men of average, or perhaps excessive, common-sense,\nthat only statements made by a professional conjurer would convince them of the\nabsence of fraud. It may be well to secure the evidence of persons specially skilled\nin conjuring devices, among others ; and such assistance has already been several,\ntimes given to the Society by well-known conjurers. I am not prepared to admit,,\nhowever, that the evidence of a conjurer is necessarily of a kind such as to render\nother evidence superfluous, nor that it is always superior to that of a person whose\nlife-long study has been the pursuit of truth.\u2014(\"C\/. R. Hodgson on \" Indian Magic\nand the Testimony of Conjurers,\" P\u00bb'Oceedim\/s S.P.R. Vol. IX., p. 354, January, 1894.),\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\ndisplay of a visible object ; and this habit is somewhat objectionable\nfor though it is possible to converse feebly and still attend keenly, yet\nsilent attention would be preferred by an observer. The medium,\nhowever, seems to feel constrained and repressed by complete silence,\nwhile genial remarks and general conversation seem to assist her. I\ndid not myself find it necessary to join in the conversation in the\nearly days of my experience.\nThe next hypothesis is collusion on the part of the sitters. In some\ncircles, where the sitters ai'e unknown to each other, and where\nconfederates are possible, the possibility of this hypothesis is such as\nalmost to destroy the value of evidence ; but in our case, where each\nobserver was an intimate friend of at least one of the others, and\nwhere all four were persons engaged in responsible pursuits, giving up\ntheir time at much inconvenience to investigate the phenomenon, this\nhypothesis becomes as nearly as possible absurd. Nevertheless, it\nmust be faced.\nFirst we have the hypothesis of invention\u2014that our meeting was\nfor the purpose of concocting an elaborate and consistent lie.\nNext, outsiders may frame the idea that sooner than not see pheno-\nmena occur some one or more of the sitters began to produce them\nthemselves for the misedification of the others.\nThird, it may be held that one of the sitters occasionally released\nthe medium's hand in order that she might move whatever was within\n.her reach, while yet he kept asserting that he had it safe.\nIt is difficult to discuss these hypotheses, because manifestly no denial\nof any of them can be of any weight. All that each sitter can do is to\nmake sure occasionally that the phenomena can occur even when he by\nhimself is holding both hands and both feet of the medium. This for\nmyself I was able to do, and I believe that the others have each at\ndifferent times similarly satisfied himself ;\n\u2014not because we really dis-\ntrusted the good faith of each other, but in order to be able to bear each\nhis own individual testimony as to the powerlessness of the medium to\nproduce the effects in any normal way ; and because in face of these\nextraordinary and incredible manifestations every possible hypothesis\nmust be pushed to the uttermost before being abandoned.\nAs to the hypothesis of collusion or confederacy on the part of any\none sitter in the way of actually producing phenomena, that is eliminated\nby the absence of each from the group in turn, and by observing that\nin his absence the phenomena occur equally well. I need hardly say\nthat MM. Richet and Ochorowicz had had an immense mass of similar\nexperience before we arrived on the scene. Therefore they could not\nsuspect us. On one occasion during our visit when things happened\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eusapia Paladino. SIT\nextremely well, Dr. Ochorowicz was outside the room taking notes,\nbeing then frequently spoken to and answering back from outside the\nwindow ; so that his presence was not essential. At a later series of\nsittings at which I was present, neither Mr. Myers nor Dr. Ochoro-\nwicz was within 200 miles of the place, and M. Bellier was several\nmiles away.\nThere remains the grotesque hypothesis that Prof. Richet has him-\nself elaborately arranged a deception : and not even this hypothesis is\nof any use, because the phenomena were observed by Ochorowicz, Finzi,\nSchiaparelli, Lombroso, and many others, both in Poland and in Italv;\nin the absence of M. Richet ;\nmoreover, on a later occasion Professor\nRichet was outside the room taking notes for twenty minutes, while\nthe phenomena inside were occurring equally well. Excepting E.P.,\nI have not observed that either the presence or the absence of any one\nindividual prevents the occurrence of the phenomena.\nIf deception on the part of responsible sitters is to be seriously\ncontemplated, nothing less than a hypothesis of wholesale and con-\ntagious lying will serve the purpose. What I am now writing is in\nthat case but part of the scheme, and therefore it is useless to attempt\nto meet this hypothesis.\nIn what follows I shall disregard it.\nBut granting that the sitters were honest and ordinarily acute, and\nthat the medium was so controlled that she could not do any of the\nabnormal things with her normal body, what about the introduction\nof a confederate ?\nHere the topographical situation, on an almost uninhabited island,\nshould be a satisfaction to outsiders. The people on the island were all\nknown and accounted for. The population was limited to the light-\nhouse-keeper's family and M. Richet's servants, viz., a boatman and\nhis wife and daughter. The lighthouse was a third of a mile away.\nThe servants slept in a separate cottage, and had retired there for the\nnight. It may be conjectured, by persons who have not seen these\nsimple Proven9al peasants, that they were accomplices of the astute\nItalian, and that the barrier of language, which prevented any\nconversation beyond the most ordinary sentences, was a device\nassumed for the occasion. It is needless to discuss this absurd\nhypothesis, because their neighbourhood is in no way essential to\nthe phenomena. I am myself satisfied that, on the island, no\none was present near the sitting room except the note-taker\noutside, whose locality was a matter of easy knowledge to those\ninside. There was only one door to the room, and that was locked\nduring two sittings by myself ; but even when it was not locked no\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., i894.\none could possibly have entered the room without our knowing. The\nwalls were of stucco and were quite plain. The windows were shuttered\ndn a sufficient manner. A large fixed divan along one end of the room\nwas opened and examined with a portable electric lamp on a later\noccasion by Professor Sidgwick and myself just before a successful\nseance, to make sure that it was empty. The sittings always began in\nfull lamp-light. This testimony may be helpful to persons not present,\nbut to me the real evidence is that I should certainly have known, by\nsight and otherwise, if any stranger had normally entered or moved\nabout the room ; and I am able to assert positively that no such\nunknown person was there.\nUnder these circumstances, I will content myself by saying that,\nbeing fully alive beforehand to this hypothesis of the introduction\nor action of a confederate, I soon came to regard it as, in this instance,\nbeyond the limits of reasonable discussion. The only accomplice\npermitted by the facts is an invisible person or animal always\naccompanying Eusapia. Nevertheless, I expect that scientific men\nwho take the trouble to think over explanations of these incredible\nfacts, will take refuge in this hypothesis of a confederate as the most\nplausible open to them ; but I feel sure that they will discard it as\ninadequate and preposterous directly they experience the phenomena\nthemselves. The facts are not to be explained by the oi'dinary devices\nof a conjurer. One is not, in the best cases, presented with an initial\nand a final state, which is the conjurer's plan, but one sees the event in\noperation ;\nobjects are transferred in a visible, audible, and fairly\nleisurely manner.\nThen there is the old Faraday hypothesis of unconscious muscular\naction on the part of sitters. This is commonly held to explain move-\nments of a table at which several persons are sitting in good faith. It\nprobably does explain some of those movements ;\nperhaps it explains\nthem all, though it certainly requires a great deal of stretching to ex-\nplain some of the movements that I have seen. But anyhow it does\nnot explain the raising of a table completely from the ground when\nhands are only on the top and all knees away from it. Still less can it\nexplain the movement of an entirely untouched object.\nThe occurrence of this last class of movement suffices to throw\nout of court the hypothesis of unconscious muscular action as ex-\nplanatory of the occurrences manifested in presence of E.P.\nThere remains the hypothesis of collective hallucination, \u2014that\nthe noises we heard, the touches we felt, the sights we saw were not\nreal but were hallucinatory, were begotten of an excited imagination.\nBefore taking part in sittings of this description I had myself\n\fNov., 1894.] \u2022\nReport on Eiisapia Paladino. 319\nthought that some such explanation must be a not improbable one ;\nbut now I perceive its extremely forced character as applied to the\npresent instance.\nSo far from being excited we were in the most matter-of-fact and\ncold-blooded spirit of enquiry. No one present could have the slightest\ndoubt as to the objective reality of the noises and touches ;\nand it is\nnot easy to have doubts about the things seen, though these were more\nhazy, and some faint doubt about them might creep in if there were\nnothing to confirm their objectivity.\nBut it has been said that no one inside the room can be sure that\nhe is not hypnotised to see, hear, and feel things that are not really\nthere : that the evidence of someone outside would be necessary and\nsufficient to dispel the illusion, i\nThe hypothesis of collective hallu-\ncination as applied to this case probably sounds most plausible to\npersons ignorant of hypnotism ; students of the subject will know\nthat there is no evidence of the possibility of this wholesale\nhypnotic power over every introduced stranger (many of which\nstrangers have been found insusceptible to ordinary hypnotic methods),\nthe power being exerted without any of the ordinary physical or\nphysiological aids. Certainly, if such kind and degree of hypnotism\nis possible, the establishment of the fact would be intensely interesting,\nhut I find it impossible seriously to contemplate this hypothesis\nas applied to the present case. If these things are hallucinations,\nmost of what reaches us through a less number of senses than usual\nmust be similarly classed; but to make assurance doubly sure, it\nis to be observed that in this case we had an outside witness, in\nthe person of the note-taker, first M. Bellier and then Dr. Ocho-\nrowicz, \u2014 once for a short time on a later occasion Prof. Richetj\nand to' the reality of all the noises they can bear emphatic testimony.2\nThe things were heard by them sitting outside in the night air of\nthe verandah precisely as they were described to them from within.\nSometimes, as in the case of the key fumbling in the lock, the note-taker\nheard the noise and enquired who was unlocking the door, before a report\nwas made to him of the occurrence. At some of the later sittings, more-\nover, I myself did not form part of the circle all the time, but got up\n1 It is probably advisable to repeat once mere that a widely-circulated statement\nconcerning a photographic proof of the occurrence of collective hallucination m the\ncase of an Indian conjurer, took its origin in a mere mischievous lie ;\nand that\napparently no rehable evidence exists to show that these Indian feats are more\nthan conjuring. See Dr.Hodgson, Proceedings S.P.R.,PartXXV., Vol. IX.,pag6354.\n2 See end of Appendix 1. At Carqueiranne, indeed, persons in other parts of tlie\nhouse stated that they had heard the noises, of piano and of moving objects in the\nlater series of sittings, and had been kept awake by them.\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\nand walked about and witnessed some of the movements from an out-\nside point of view. I am compelled to conclude that this unsupported\nhypothesis of collective hallucination must be abandoned, as the\nhypothesis of cheating has been abandoned. If it is to be contemplated\nat all, perhaps its most plausible form is to suppose that we ware-\ndeceived into imagining that we had full control over the medium,,\nwhom we saw and felt in her chair at the table, while she was really\nfree and moving about producing the effects. This hypothesis will, I\nbelieve, seem quite absurd to each person sepai'ately as soon as he has\nexperienced the effects, but it may possibly commend itself to out-\nsiders who have not yet taken part in the observation. It may possibly\ncommend itself, as the explanation involving least strain, even to some\nactual observers ; but so far as I know it has not as yet done so. Any-\nhow the effects themselves are not illusions : the phenomena do really\noccur ; and it remains to describe them, and, if possible, gradually, by\ncontinued investigation, to account for them.\nThis is what we have now to do : first to bring those leaders of\nscience who are willing to make the essay to a personal knowledge\nof the occurrences themselves : next to investigate their laws, if they\nhave any : and thereby to trace them to their origin.\nThe Simulation of Deception.\nBut in thus inviting fresh persons to experience the occurrences\nthemselves there is a certain risk to be run. Not always are the\ntrances equally good and complete ; not always are the manifestations\nequally clear. Hence, it may happen that at a first sitting the\nthings experienced may be of a weak and unsatisfactory order, and the\nnew comer may think that, if that is all, he need not waste his time any\nmore ; or if a few unusual things do occur in a place not far enough\nremoved from the medium to be free from suspicion, he may accuse\nsome other sitter of collusion, \u2014say of having let go the medium's\nhand. This is a distinct danger to be faced. A new sitter feels himself,\nsay, touched on the shoulder in the dark by a rustling something which\nseems to protrude momentarily from the body of the medium, and he\nnaturally concludes that it is her arm ; or he may, perhaps, dimly see\na thing looking just like an arm engaged in carrying some small\nobject not far from the medium. He is holding one hand himself,\nand knows that it is not the aroi belonging to that; so he jumps to\nthe conclusion that another sitter, who knows equally clearly that\nhe has all the time been holding the other hand, has momentarily\nlet go.\nI was familiar with accusations of this kind of cheating that had been\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eusapia Paladino. 321\nmade between one sitter and another, and I was much impressed with\nthe extreme liabihty to such an accusation. Some few of the occur-\nrences happen precisely as if a hand or sometimes as if a foot of the\nmedium had been released ; and if those occurrences were all that were\nexperienced, a lurking doubt of such laxity on the part of another sitter\ncould hardly be repressed, even though that other sitter were Mr.\nHuxley himself. Moreover, if everything that happens happens within\nreach of the medium, it is difficult to meet the objection that con-\nceivably one of the holders has been hypnotised to think that he is-\nholding a hand when he really is not. Occurrences too close to the\nmedium, and in the dark, must remain open to some shadow of this\ndoubt, but with patience and more sittings it is extremely unlikely that\nsuch dubious phenomena will be the only ones displayed. Sometimes\nthe thing moved will be beyond the reasonable range of any such\nhypothesis ; sometimes there will be light enough to see that there is\nno normal contact ;\nand, as in my case also, sometimes one will\nfeel the suspicious contact while one has hold oneself of both hands and\nboth feet of the medium, with the head visible or otherwise under\ncontrol; in fact sooner or later the thing will occur in such a way as to\nrender the hypothesis of self-deception the only one possible, short\nof admitting the fact as it is.\nI was much interested in observing several times this simulation of\ndeception on the part of the phenomena : it is a thing to be clearly\nadmitted, and nothing but patience on the part of a new sitter can\nguard him from making unjust accusations if his early experience\nhappen thus to be untoward, or if he is unprepared with the knowledge\nthat things sometimes appear, looking like hands and arms, which yet-\ndo not of necessity normally belong to anyone present. It is his duty\nto ascertain whether they so belong or not, but he should not jump to\nhasty conclusions. This appearance as of extra limbs is indeed so\nprominent a feature that actual physical malformation of the medium\nhas been suggested to account for them. But I have authority to say\nthat she has been medically examined, and I know that Mrs. Sidgwick\nand Mrs. Lodge took pains to assure themselves that there was nothing\nwhatever abnormal about her external configuration. They were also\nsatisfied that she did not bring with her into the seance room any\nconcealed appliances or dummy limbs.\nThe accusation of collusion is manifestly a serious one, and to guard\nagainst it I think that in no investigation of this kind should\nanyone be admitted who is not willing to bind himself to take\npart in a certain number of sittings, \u2014say four, at least, \u2014before making\nany sort of accusation or public testimony. There is danger, even\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894-\nthen, that his disgust at a failui'e on the first attempt may lead him\nto regard all the other sittings as a mere nuisance to be endured ; in\nwhich case his unscientific deportment may ensure a sequence of\nsimilar failures.\nIt is obviously absurd for a person after one sitting to consider\nhis experience of more value than the accumulated experiences of\nmany other observers over a long peiiod ;\nbut, as a matter of\nexperience, absurdity is no deterrent. At least one distinguished\nProfessor, for instance, after one bad sitting with Mrs. Piper when\nshe was not properly entranced, jumped to the conclusion that\nhe understood the whole fraud and refused to have anything\nmore to do with her; and one frequently sees this bad experience of\nhis quoted as a strong argument against the genuineness of the Piper\nphenomena. A written agreement to attend at least 4 sittings, at two\nof which he must be content to act, if necessary, merely as a\nwitness, without active interference, might well be required of\nanybody introduced to these unusual experiences. After that, he\nmust of course be free to make any report which he may think proper.\nA novice should realise first the kind of things attested by others,\nand then gradually introduce such reasonable modifications as may\nserve to convince him of the genuineness of what he has experienced.\nI believe also that it would be well to bind a stranger, or one who\nspecially prided himself on his superiority to the reception of new\ntruth, on his honour to play no pranks, such as himself to touch and\nmove things to the possible confusion of other observers, nor to exert\nsuch surprise or violence upon the medium as might be bodily dangerous\nto her.\nWhile speaking of the simulation of deception exhibited by some\nof the phenomena, \u2014a subject of great interest and importance and on\nwhich we now ought to be prepared to act more wisely in the light of\nmany years' past experience of some of our members, \u2014I wish specially\nto record the fact that Eusapia herself in her ordinary state is not\naverse to exhibiting things which she seems to consider just as good\nas those which are accomplished while she is unconscious. I have no\ndoubt that she does this out of good nature and a wish to please\n;\nshe is not a person of high education, and apparently she does not\nclearly discriminate between what is really of interest and what is\nnot.\nOne afternoon she began, with me alone, to jig a table about and\ncause liquid in a jar to shake; others came in and took part in the\nprocedure, and presently the light table was lifted for an instant from\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eusapia Paladino. 323\ni}he floor ; but the whole thing was wearisome and quite unhke the\ngenuine phenomenon. The movements were such as anyone could\nproduce, and a momentary raising of the table could be eff'ected in her\nthen position without serious difficulty. The experiments werepersisted in\nfor half-an-hour out of motives of politeness to her, but I am not sorry\nfor the experience. It enables me to warn intending observers that if,\non the strength of any such exhibition, they proceed to accuse Eusapia\nof fraud they may be stultifying themselves as well as harming the\ncause of truth. Such performances are doubtless extremely unwise on\nher part, but it would be unduly severe to call them fraudulent\n;\nthere need be no fraud in the matter ; she is probably experi-\nmenting in her way on whether she too cannot do the things\nshe has heard talked about for years ; and she succeeds only in\ngiving a very poor imitation of some of them, such as could hardly\ndeceive anyone.\nAt the beginning of a regular seance, too, before she has properly gone\ninto the trance and assumed the personality of \"John,\" the move-\nments are of an intermediate character (in my experience)\u2014not so futile\nas those produced in her ordinary state, yet nothing like so conclusive\nas those obtained in a complete trance. In a bad sitting it is probable\nthat this intermediate state is the only one attained, as was sometimes\nthe case with Mrs. Piper ; the medium is then more than half conscious\nof what is happening, and beginners must be prepared for the chance\nof one or two such unsatisfactory sittings, by which no one will expect\nthem to be convinced.\nAt the time when the above was written I happened to have had\nonly good sittings with Eusapia, and my only experience of what was\nlikely to happen in the others was based upon what happened when\nshe was not entranced at all. Judging from that experience, I thought\nit not unlikely that she may sometimes half-somnambulically attempt\nto achieve effects which she thinks desired in what may readily appear\na fraudulent manner. Later experience, with sittings of a less\nuniformly successful character, though it has not, so far, verified that\nconjecture, leads me to supplement it with the further opinions (1) that\nit must be possible, by sufficient precaution, to check such attempts,\neven if made ; and (2) that, if undue latitude were given, it would be\nreasonable to expect some such attempt sooner or later. For it must\nbe observed that in the trance state the medium is in a curious condi-\ntion, a condition in which it is really unfair to leave her uncontrolled\nas if she were in the full possession of her normal faculties ;\nmoreover,\nit may very likely be true that the difference between a normal and an\n.abnormal operation is a distinction based rather upon our present\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 189-4.\nignorance than upon anything ultimate in the nature of things, so that\nif in the trance state either of two methods of achieving a result appear\nto her equally feasible, it may need an effort to remember that one\nof those methods will strike spectators with astonishment, while the\nother will be stigmatised by them as imposture. It is, however,\nunlikely that both methods are really equally easy\u2014the abnormal\nmethod clearly requires an effort\u2014and there must be a temptation\nto take the easier path in cases of difficulty, if that is unguardedly\nleft open.\nIt must be understood that in her ordinary state Eusapia under-\nstands the phenomena as little as anybody, and has less actual experi-\nence of them than other people have. She can only know about them\nwhat she may be told afterwards, and her opinion on them is of no\nmore value than her imitations.\nAll danger of unfair accusation will be avoided if sitters will only\nhave the common sense to treat her, not as a scientific person engaged\nin a demonstration, but as a delicate piece of apparatus wherewith\nthey themselves are making an investigation. She is an instrument\nwhose ways and idiosyncracies must be learnt, and to a certain extent\nhumoured, just as one studies and humours the ways of some much less\ndelicate piece of physical apparatus turned out by a skilled instrument-\nmaker.\nA bad joint in a galvanometer circuit may cause irregular and capri-\ncious and deceptive effects, yet no one would accuse the instrument of\ncheating. So also with Eusapia : it is obviously right to study the\nphenomena she exhibits in their entirety, so far as can be done with\nsuch a comphcated mechanism, but charges of fraud should not be lightly\nand irresponsibly made\u2014however justified such charges may have been\nin other cases. It is to be observed that Eusapia has nothing whatever\nto do with arranging the sittings : she comes in when all is ready and\nsits down where requested. By means of raps and other movements,\noccasionally also by interjections, she does subsequently exert some\ncontrol over the proceedings; but the control of the agency was never\nof such a character (in my experience so far) as to assist or encourage\nunfair practices, though it certainly hampered free experimentation.\nA course of sittings with stupid and ignorant clients is, how-\never, not unlikely to lead in the long run to deception and fraud.\nIt is a serious danger which all mediums must run, unless they\ncan be kept in the hands of wise and i-esponsible persons. It is-\nhuman to succumb to temptation, and the temptation will sooner or\nlater arise :\u2014say, when the trance will not come on and nothing genuine-\nwill happen. But the behaviour of such a decadent medium, though.\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eitsapia Paladino. 325\nmuch to be regretted, has no necessary connexion with the phenomena\nexhibited by him before he cheated, if only we can be sure that he had\na time of honesty. It is indeed always possible for subsequent\nexposui-e to be instructive, viz., when it throws light on modes of\noperation and possibilities of mal-observation ; but it will be scarcely\nreasonable, though it may be natural, hereafter summarily to discard\nexisting evidence at the mere rumour of detected trickery, without\ndetails showing similarity between the present and the future. If,\nfor instance, the experiments with Eusapia are now made really and\nfinally secure, her subsequent conduct, though in many ways a\nmatter of interest, and to some extent of responsibility, will have\nno directly scientific bearing. My insistence on this point may be\nmisunderstood, but it is impossible to make a report at all if the act is\nheld to make one responsible for the future career of some practically\nunknown person. I have put no confidence in Eusapia's character at\nall, but for scientific purposes have treated her as a being liable to\ndeceive both voluntarily and involuntarily. What I have deprecated\na few paragraphs above, is not justifiable and necessary suspicion but\nhasty and ill-founded accusation.\nGeneral Propositions Concerning the Phenomena.\nI have explained that the investigation of the laws of the effects\nis complicated and rendered apparently unprecise by reason of\ntheir occurring in the presence of a live person, and that they\nhave all the capricious characteristics of vitality and independent\n\"volition.\nI have likened the movements to those caused by a fly in a\ngalvanometer or a mouse in a balance case : it would be useless in\nsuch case to map out all the motions, yet there would be no doubt of\ntheir objectivity, and they might follow some sort of half recognisable\nlaws. Thus a beam of light might conceivably keep the animal still,\nwhile darkness liberated its activity. Silent attention might similarly\nparalyse it, while miscellaneous talking might encourage it to pro-\nceed. A violent intrusion or other surprise might check any further\n,\nmanifestation for a long time, and so on.\nThe things which happen in the seance-room happen precisely as if\nan invisible or only partially visible intelligent live animal of some\nstrength were hovering about and moving objects ;\nmoving them with\ngreatest ease in the neighbourhood of the medium, but occasionally at\nconsiderable distances, and sometimes exerting more force than the\nmedium's ordinary muscles could be supposed capable of.\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894,\nWith reference to the abnormal exercise of force on the part of\nthe medium, an experience gained during my second visit to the South\nof France is of interest. After the seance the medium is usually for\nsome time only half awakened, and a slight stimulus is occasionally\nsufficient to send her back into trance again ; and even though this\ndoes not happen, yet the abnormal power seems not quite departed, so\nthat she may sometimes move an object without contact, or may\nproduce writing or marks without ordinary means. The advantage\nof these post-trance effects is that they occur in full lamplight ; the dis-\nadvantage of them is that they happen rather unexpectedly. On the\noccasion now to be mentioned, the usual operation of squeezing a\nhand dynamometer was being gone through by everybody after a--\ns^ance, and I was writing down the results. The scale was arbitrary^\nbut it may be said that women ranged from 40 to 70, men from 70 tO'\n160 or thereabouts. No one was able to reach 165.^ Eusapia's-\nnormal I'ecord was about 50, and after the stance she was usually too\nfatigued for so much as this. But on this one occasion, after she had\nsqueezed the spring normally with her right hand, and had taken it in.\nher left, she called out that \"John\" was squeezing her hand on the\ninstrument. She was standing by the lamp at which I was writing, and\nI saw the index going up gradually to an abnormal figure. It went up to\n138. Professor Ptichet then took the instrument from her, reset it, and\ngave it back with the index against her palm, so that no accidental\ncontact of finger tips could afiect it. She squeezed again in the same\nforcible manner, and this time the registering index was at 210. Once\n1 1 can sometimes get up to 170 now, but the heat was excessive then.

Professor Richet says that\nsuch hysteric exhibitions of abnormal strength are not unknown in\nmedical experience. Her left hand is normally rather stronger than\nher right, and the best effects are supposed to be produced at her left\nside during the trance. This may be considered a suspicious\ncircumstance : it is well to have all such circumstances emphasised.\nIf the actual occurrences had not been sufiicient to overpower all my\nown suspicions, I should, of course, express strongly the last vestige\nof doubt which I might feel. It is eminently a case where it is neces-\nsary to exaggerate and bring into prominence the least trace of residual\ndoubt.\nThe phenomena usually develop themselves in a certain order, in-\ndicating a series of increasing difiiculty : and the following is the\norder of the early stages, so far as I have observed :\n\u2014\n1st, and easiest, a slow or steady force or push\u2014(a) on inert\nmatter, such as the table or other objects, (producing tilts and\nmovements) ;\n(b) on the clothes or skin of some person present.\n2nd, a sudden and audible striking force\n\u2014\n(a) on ordinary objects^\n(producing raps) ;\n(b) on the bodies of people present.\n3rd, a visible appearance or shade, more or less closely imitating\npart of a human body.\n4tb, a similar appearance not only visible but also tangible ; able\nto produce the sensation of grasping contact in whatever part of the\nbody it is seen to touch, and also capable of moving objects visibly and\npermanently.\nSome of the simpler things occur in the light, but the most developed\n1 The follovving is the complete dynamometer record for this particular evening ;\nright hand first, then left hand, in each case ;\nreadings being taken on the outside\nscale of the instrument.\nCarqueiranne, September 2nd, 1894.\nBefore sitting.

This is obviously to be regretted, and efforts are frequently\nmade to get them done in light, but more and more darkness is usually\nasked for by the agency and can hardly be refused except at the\nexpense of not getting any results : and it seems more useful to get\nresults for such observation as is possible under the circumstances than\nnot to get them at all.

My sole object is to give as unbiassed and exact an\naccount of these strange experiences as possible, and to bring into\nprominence all weak points. If, notwithstanding all these weak points,\nI am able to profess myself convinced, that by itself is a fact which\n\u2022different readers will appreciate differently. It is only fair to say in\nthe present connexion that the darkness was seldom sufficient to\npermit a person to move about the room unperceived, and when it was\nso dark as this, the conditions were not considered at their best.\nWhen the conditions were good, the medium could be seen as well as\nfelt, and the other persons present could be seen too. No confederate\nwas possible.\nThere are a certain number of questions or topics which naturally\narise with regard to the conditions of the phenomena ; these I will now\ntake seriatim.\nEffect of Light.\nLight is an etherial undulation, and it is improbable that the\nextremely feeble amount of energy needed to excite the retina should\nhave any physically deleterious effect. Moreover dark radiation, which\nmay be equally or much more energetic, is not known to exert any\nhostile action. Every room is full of ether waves from every object in\nit, and an iron ball or stove below red heat would probably not be ob-\njected to by the agency or medium. Perhaps ultra-violet rays would\nequally well escape recognition, and in that case, if the invisible \"illumi-\nnation \" were sufficient, a series of photographs might be taken\u2014a highly\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eusapia Paladino. 329\ndesirable thing to do, and a matter to be separately considered in\nAppendix II, ;\n\u2014but it .is by no means certain that a knowledge of the\nexistence of a photographic eye might not exert a depressing influence\non the trance-intelligence, which appears keener and more knowing\nthan the ordinary intelligence of E. P. Bandaging her eyes does not,\nI am told, prevent her sensibility to light. Professor Richet will report\non this subject.\nOn the whole it seems to us most likely that the action of visible\nlight is not a physical so much as a psychological one ;\nthat it is not\nthe quivering ether but the seeing power of the sitters which is the\nhostile fact. It may be really and unavoidably hostile, or it may be\nonly hostile by suggestion ; and in the latter case, if it could be sug-\ngested to E. P. that light would be beneficial rather than adverse, the\nconditions of investigation might be improved.\nAt the second series of sittings I had an electric lamp which could\nbe flashed up ; but it is a serious responsibihty to attempt a surprise.\nAny rapid change of illumination, such as I tried on a small scale once\nor twice, seems to be felt by the entranced medium in a painful\nmanner, unless she is prepared beforehand. It is unnecessary to\nemphasise the obviously suspicious character of this fact. After notice\nshe can stand even the magnesium flash light, as used for photo-\ngraphic purposes (almost as if she were hypnotised not to perceive\nit) ; but without notice it would be rash to attempt a sudden\nillumination except under responsible medical advice ; and even then\nit would be difficult to time the flash appropriately, unless the occur-\nrences were of a more durable character than those experienced by me.\nGradual training to endure a steady light seems the more hopeful\nmethod of investigation.\nIn saying that the conditions could be improved I am not im-\nplying doubt of the reality of the movements\u2014I have seen them\noccur in sufficient light to feel sure of that, besides hearing them and\nfeeling them ad nauseam,\u2014but I want to see more of those things\nthat give one the (probably absurd) impression of being processes\nor apparent protuberances from the medium's body. I want to\nascertain whether they always or only occasionally exist, from what\npart of the medium's body they spring, if they always do spring\nthence, and whether they are continuous all the way when their\nfurther terminations are visible. I had a hoop ready to pass over her\nbody when some continuous distant action was going on, to see if\nanything would be intercepted, but I found no convenient opportunity\nfor performing the experiment. Continuous distant actions lasting\nsome time were rare ; most of the events were quickly over. Moreover\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\nthe holding of hands round in a chain, which the medium unfortunately\nhas grown accustomed to request, and indeed insist upon, is a serious\nbar to free and easy experimenting. If observation were easy the\nwhole thing would probably have been accepted and understood long\nao-o. The visible manifestations \u2014the imitation of hands, etc.\n\u2014\nare sufficiently objective to be seen by several persons at once\nor to be felt by one person and seen by another ;\nbut they\nseem to disappear suddenly, leaving no trace, and their relation\nto or inter-connexion with ordinary matter does not seem always con-\nsistent. (For instance, sometimes they are intercepted by drapery^\nat other times they appear to penetrate it.) If the things are faintly\nluminous, as has been sometimes asserted, then darkness may be the\nbest condition for seeing them, but when some portable object is\nsailing across the room one would naturally like to have a look at\nwhat is holding it, in a good clear light if possible. It is not of course\ncertain that anything would be visible.\nIt is possible that more experienced observers may have a definite\nopinion based upon past experience on these and many other matters. I\nmust leave them to speak for themselves. In a matter of this sort at its\npresent stage it seems almost necessary for each new observer to start\nfor himself de novo without loading himself with a knowledge of\nwhat has already been done, and without attempting to learn from,\npast testimony, lest he become prejudiced.^ The necessity for this con-\nstantly new foundation is a weakness and defect which before long I\nhope will be remedied. It will be remedied as soon as the subject can\ntake its place as a branch of orthodox science, and until it so takes its\nplace it can hardly make much progress.\nNature of Objects Moved.\nForeign objects unknown to and previously untouched by the\nmedium do not seem so likely to be operated upon as more familiar\nobjects. I myself at first tried to get things out of my pocket moved,,\nbut unsuccessfully. Later I chose things belonging to or connected\nwith Eusapia, taking them, however, secretly, and arranging them as I\npleased beforehand. These were successfully moved in nearly every\ncase, provided they were inside the room. It may be well for intending\nexperimenters to remember that when they seal things up or otherwise\nplace things for experiment it is preferable to choose something previously\nhandled by the medium and not some foreign object without interest for\nher or association with her. The probability that the latter objects.\n1 This must be my apo'o^ry to those learned in the history of this subject for my\nobvious ignoiance of its literature.\n\fNov., 1894.1 Report on Easapia Polaclino. 33L\nare best may sound suspicious, as so many other things may sound, but,\nso far as I see, the suspicious character of the fact is only apparent\n;\nsuch objects will serve the purpose of experiment as well as any other\nif properly arranged, and one cannot be held responsible for the human\ncharacter of the manifestations ; nor can it be considered altogether\nunreasonable.\nSource of the Energy.\nPhysical movements imply a source of energy, and it may be\nassumed that the energy necessary is withdrawn from those present\n\u2014\nprincipally I suppose, perhaps entirely, from the medium ;\nwho was some-\ntimes completely exhausted, \u2014although she was usually quite restored\nby a night's rest. I shall leave others to report on the dynamometer\nreadings which, as already incidentally mentioned, were taken before\nand after each seance, in order to ascertain, if possible, the source of the\nenergy; nothing has yet been clearly proved by them so far as I know,\nbut if once the movements are admitted it will be conceded that animal\nvitality is the most natural, indeed the only Hkely, source of the energy\nemployed.\nSeat of the Reaction.\nAn object cannot be moved by ordinary physical laws unless som&\nother body experience an equal opposite reaction. So also a body\ncannot be raised from the earth unless some other bodies experience\nan equal increment of weight.\nIn the case of these movements the simple physical laws may con-\nceivably turn out inapplicable, but it is unlikely that they will, and I\nregard it as exceedingly important to localise the reaction in every\ncase where possible.\nIt appears most feasible to do this when some heavy object is being\nlifted from the ground. Assuming this done directly by the medium,\nshe would gain in weight, and, if placed upon a scale pan or regis-\ntering balance, her weight should increase until the thing begins to\ndrop. The medium's weight is 60 kilos., and the heaviest thing I have\nseen her raise is 22 kilos. I have not yet succeeded in getting this-\ndone while she was on a balance, but I hope to persevere in this\nattempt.\nI may say that the aspect of affairs when a heavy body is being\nraised, with the medium's fingers gently touching the top of it, is not\nas if it were being pulled up from above, but as if it were being\npushed up from below. This is the appearance of the thing\u2014that is\nall I can say at present. She may be standing by it with not only hands\nheld but with feet also held, so that extensive undetected knee action is-\nimpossible (though, indeed, I have not found that anyone, however\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\nstrong, can thoroughly raise the heavy table, standing, with his\nknees); nevertheless, the thing rises as if an extra protuberance jutted\nout from her body, and with great effort (in the case of a heavy table)\neffected the elevation. Or, it may be said, as if someone got under the\ntable and heaved it up with his back. Now the experiment of the ab-\nnormal dynamometer grasp related above indicates that the medium\nhas at times altogether exceptional strength ; and it would be rash to\ndeny that during some such access the table could be lifted. But then\nsuch force as this can hardly be considered a normal phenomenon, and,\neven if it were so regarded, there has been in my experience often no\nsufficient i^int d'ajjpui for the force to be normally applied. Never-\ntheless the two kinds of phenomenon may shade into one another, and\nperhaps one of them may help to throw light on the other.\nAll these movements are accompanied by effort on the part of the\nmedium, who often when moving a distant object makes a small sym-\npathetic movement in its direction. Similarly when the key-board\n\u2022of an accordion or piano is being apparently fingered at a distance the\nfingers of the medium are sometimes felt by those holding her hands to\nbe going through apparently appropriate motions in their grasp.\nSideway movements of heavy furniture were also accompanied by\nconvulsive movements of the medium, as if she were conscious of the\neffort and was really producing it by some sort of abnormal process or\nprotuberance. The slight movements or strains here spoken of produce\nno effect except pressure against the persons who are holding her, but\nthey shew that she is conscious of the effort being made and is\nsympathetically following it ;\n\u2014much as men crane over a billiard-table\n.as though to help on a ball which has insufficient momentum.\nIn this case also I want to examine the seat of the reaction, if\npossible, by placing the medium on a wheeled or suspended platform\u2014\n-\nif this can be done without endangering her sense of security and\nthereby spoiling the effects\u2014so as to see whether her platform moves\nin a direction opposite to that of the moved table or desk.\nI do not regard this attempt at detection of the seat of the reaction\nas affecting the evidence for the reality of the movements, but as con-\nveying information as to the laws of the unknown force. I anticipate,\nbut quite gratuitously, that the reaction will be found on the person\nof the medium, so that when she is supporting a table she will be found\n,heavier by the weight of the table, but it by no means necessarily\nfollows that it is so ; it is conceivable that the reaction may be\ndiffused through the room. A reaction may be taken up and diffused\nby air molecules, as, for instance, in the case of a lamb being carried off\n\fNov., 1894.] Report on Eusapia Paladino. 333'\nby an eagle ; it would not in that case be easy to demonstrate the\nstill existing weight of the lamb.\nIt is a matter for experiment to ascertain where the reaction is ;\nand, if no adequate reaction can be found, the phenomenon may have to\nbe likened more nearly to the action of a flying animal than to that of\nan animal resting on the ground.\nSympathetic Movements of the Medium.\nThe fact, just recorded, that the medium's body undergoes sym-\npathetic or corresponding movements or twitches is very instructive and\ninteresting. Sometimes when she is going to push a distant object she-\nwill make a little sudden push with her hand in its direction, and\nimmediately afterwards the object moves. Once this was done for mj\nedification with constantly the same object, viz. a bureau in a.\ncorner of the room, but with the group of observers and medium\n(under control as usual of course) first close to it and then gradually\nfurther and further away from it, and I was instructed by the agency\nto observe that the time-interval between the push and the response-\nincreased as the distance increased, so that when 6 or 7 feet away the\ntime interval was something like 2 seconds. This detail by itself is of\nno value save as a hint for investigation, but the fact of the sympathetic-\nmovements on the part of the medium seems to me of considerable\ninterest. When the accordion is being played, the fingers of the medium\nare moving in a thoroughly appropriate manner, and the process\nreminds one of the twitching of a dog's legs when he is supposed\nto be dreaming that he is chasing a hare. It is as if Eusapia\nwere dreaming that she was fingering an instrument, and dream-\ning it so vividly that the instrument was actually played. It\nis as if a dog dreamt of the chase with such energy that a distant\nhare was really captured and killed, as by a phantom dog; and,,\nfanciful as for the moment it may seem, and valueless as I must\nsuppose such speculations are, I am, I confess, at present more than\nhalf disposed to look in some such direction for a clue to these\neffects. In an idealistic interpretation of nature it has by many\nphilosophers been considered that thought is the reality, and that\nmaterial substratum is but a consequence of thought. So ni a\nminor degree it appears here : it is as if, let us say, the dream of\nthe entranced person were vivid enough to physically affect sur-\nrounding objects, and actually to produce objective results to cause\nnot only real and permanent movements of ordinary objects, but also-\ntemporary fresh aggregations of material particles into extraordinary\nobjects ; these aggregations being objective enough to be felt, heard,\nseen, and probably even photographed, while they last.\n\f:S34 Journal of Society for Psychical Kesearch. [Nov., 1894.\nSummary and Conclusion.\nHowever the facts are to be explained, the possibility of the facts I\nam constrained to admit ; there is no further room in my mind for doubt.\nAny person without invincible prejudice who had had the same experi-\nence would come to the same broad conclusion, viz., that things hitherto\nheld impossible do actually occur. If one such fact is clearly estab-\nlished, the conceivability of others may be more readily granted, and I\nconcentrated my attention mainly on what seemed to me the most\nsimple and definite thing, viz., the movement of an \" untouched\n\"\nobject in suiiicient light for no doubt of its motion to exist. This\nI have now witnessed several times ; the fact of movement being\nvouched for by both sight and hearing, sometimes also by touch, and\nthe objectivity of the movement being demonstrated by the sounds\nheai'd by an outside observer, and by permanent alteration in position\nof object.\nWhen I say an \" untouched \" object, I mean that it is not\n-touched in a normal way by any person present, nor by instru-\nments or other indirect contrivances wielded by any one : but I am\nnot prepared to believe that the body is, technically speaking, acted\nupon at a distance. It is untouched by any part of any person's\nnormal body, but it is probable that before motion occurs the object\nmust be touched by something ; \u2014something which occasionally seems\nlike an abnormal temporary prolongation from \"the medium's \" body.\nThe phenomena do not seem to me to modify the fundamental laws of\nphysics, but perhaps they may lead to an extension of the recognised\nlaws of biology. ^ In other words, it is only in the presence of a living\nbeing that these actions occur, and the power which enables such\nmovements appears to be a modified or unusual display of vital power,\ndirecting energy in an unusual way along unrecognised channels, but\notherwise effecting much the same kinds of movement as can be\ncaused by the action of ordinary limbs. Thus, instead of action at a\ndistance in the physical sense, what I have observed may be said to\nbe more like vitality at a distance\u2014the action of a living organism\nexerted in unusual directions and over a range greater than the\nordinary.\nThe reason why I speak of temporary prolongations from the\n1 It may be asked why I abstain from contemplating the spiritualistic hypothesis.\nThe reason is that I have not yet seen it scientifically framed, and I do not feel that in\nany of the vague forms known to me it is specially applicable to these particular\nfacts. In order to be able to move matter I must presume that some sort of body is\nnecessary, as well as a will ; and the people present are accommodated with both.\nOne of the rules of philosophizing is, to exhaust the possibilities of the known before\nseeking the aid of the unknown. But if ultimately I perceive that the agency of\nsomething at present undefined is a real assistance in accounting for the phenomena,\nI shall hope to face the question frankly.\n\fNov.. 1894,] Report on Eusapia Paladino. 3\nmedium's body is because I myself have been frequently touched by\nsomething which might most readily be described as such a prolonga-\ntion or formation, and have sometimes seen such a thing while it was\ntouching another person. But the effect on an observer is usually\nmore as if the connecting link, if any, were invisible and intangible,\nor as if a portion of vital or directing energy had been detached, and\nwere producing distant movements without any apparent connexion\nAvith the medium.\nTo illustrate by things of common knowledge something of what\nI mean by these hypothetical prolongations and projections of vital\nactivity :\n\u2014That which I mean by prolongation occurs when an\n.animal has a swelling or protuberance which having effected some\ncontact or movement of an otherwise untouched object may then\ndisappear, (of this the best known non-pathological instances are the\nprocesses of the amoeba); whereas the further stage of projection of\nvital activity occurs when an animal or plant has an off-shoot or bud\nwhich detaches itself more or less completely and maintains a more or\nless independent existence, (of this perhaps the only known instances\nare connected with the operations of reproduction). But, although the\nphenomena experienced often suggest that something analogous to one\nor other of the above processes is in operation, I by no means wish to\nimply that the real cause is to be looked for in this direction,\u2014such\na hypothesis would doubtless to a biologist seem absurd ;\nand two pages\nabove I venture to suggest tentatively another vague and more meta-\nphysical direction, in which, I confess, I at present feel more tempted\nto try and grope ;\nnevertheless it is almost necessary to use terms\nappropriate to some biological hypothesis in order to describe the\nphenomena. The facts are hard even to describe, and the language\nused is to be understood as part of the description, and not as aiming\nat an explanation ;\nyet perhaps it may be considered that some\nsuch unexpected power of protoplasmic activity is a less violent\nhypothesis than genuine physical actio in distans without medium of\ncommunication.\nThat is my report, introductory to such portion of the detailed notes\nof the sittings as it may be considered worth while to print. It is\ndrawn up under a heavy sense of responsibility and without enthu-\nsiasm. I am under no delusion as to ease and rapidity in the matter\nof convincing a world. The world is very busy, and I suppose that this\nreport will not be much read, or that it will be read only by those who\nare already more than half convinced. I was not convinced by what\nI had read myself, though indeed some of Mr. Crookes' statements^ were\ni Quarterly Journal of Science, July and October, 1871, Vol. VIII., pp. 345 and 484-492.\n\f336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\nsuch as to compel respect ; and why should what I now say convince\nothers ? I do not expect to convince, but I do wish to make a prirnd\nfacie case for investigation : I do wish to see these truths taken under\nthe wing of orthodox science. Even this amount of recognition my\nreport standing alone could not appreciably influence, but it will not>\nstand alone. The phenomena exhibited by Eusapia Paladino have\nattracted attention from savants of nearly all the countries of the\nContinent, and I hope that my report will be ultimately embedded in\na mass of their independent testimony.\nAppended to the bare narrative of facts I have thought it useful,\nand therefore legitimate, to represent their appearance more vividly\nby the aid of language which may justly be stigmatised as involving\nsome amount of hypothesis. But I need hardly say that I attach no\nimportance whatever to any of these vague attempts at hypotheses,\nthough they are all that I am able to frame at present. They represent\npartially our discussions held on the ile Roubaud, in the midst of the\nphenomena, and they include my friends' notions as well as my own.\nThey may possibly be of some use if taken as part of the description,\nof facts, since they represent the effect of the phenomena on the minds\nof unprejudiced observers ; and they have at least aided my own mind\nto overcome some of its nausea at the reception of these unpalatable\nfacts. Time achieves many things, and it may achieve the assimilation\nand digestion even of these tough morsels.\nWhatever may be the present fate of this report, I assume that if\nincorporated in our Proceedings it may meet the eye of a better in-\nstructed posterity, to whom such of the statements in it as are true\nwill have become a commonplace, and such of the statements as are\nfalse will appear properly ludicrous. To such posterity I appeal, and\nI would that all hostile criticism now made could be similarly bound\nup in our Proceedings, and go down along with these lame but con-\nscientious records, so that the atmosphere of the time in which they\nare made might be rightly estimated, and the reputation both of critic\nand of criticised might meet with the same impartial judgment, with\nthe same impartial award.\n[For details of Seances, see Apj^endix I., pp. 346-357.]\nMr. F. \"W. H. Myers then spoke to the following effect :\n\u2014\n\" I had the pleasure of being Professor Richet's guest on the ile\nRoubaud, July -Jlst\u201427th, and of witnessing the phenomena which\nProfessor Lodge has described. I entirely confirm all that he has\nsaid, which is strictly based upon the notes carefully taken at the\ntime. These notes, as already described, were jotted down from\n\fNov., 1894.] Discussion of Professor Lodge's Paper. 337\nminute to minute by the note-taker outside the room, in accordance\nwith our dictation from inside. The words to be written down were\ncalled out to him generally by Professor Richet, but sometimes by one\nof the rest of us. On the morning after each sitting Professor Lodge\nand I translated together into English the notes of the preceding\nevening, while our own memories were fresh ;\nadding such explanations,\nmeasurements, &c., as seemed needful to make the notes coherent, and\nto avoid misunderstandings. If we had any doubt on any point, we\nconsulted Professors Richet and Ochorowicz, and put nothing down\nunless all memories were agreed upon it. I mention this because\nwhere phenomena are so apparently casual and unconnected it seems\ndesirable that not only should the record be simultaneous, but the\nredaction of the record, \u2014which is sure to need explanatory words\nhere and there, \u2014should also be as closely subsequent as possible.\n\" Being thus fully satisfied with Professor Lodge's presentment of\nthe phenomena witnessed, I need here only add a few of the incidents\nwhich he has omitted for brevity's sake ;\nsuch, especially, as I chanced\nfrom some accident of position or otherwise to have good opportunity\nof observing.\n\" Violence of the touches. \u2014It so happened that I received the most\nviolent of the pressures experienced at these sittings, and also the\nonly pressure, I think, felt at three separate points at once. In the\nnotes for July 26th occur the words :\n'\nM. was seized from behind as\nby a bear and compressed. It turned him about and ubimately drew\nhim violently away from L., who saw him moving, and felt the trans-\nmitted pull. M. then felt as if a big man were kneeling behind him\nseizing him round back and thighs, and shaking him vigorously.\nEmbrace strong and lasting.' Here, when I say ' seized round back\nand thighs,' I mean that the feeling was as if a powerful head were\nbutting me in the small of the back, while I was shaken sideways,\nfirst to one side then to the other, by something which pressed strongly\non both hips, though without, in this case, any definite sensation oifingers.\nWhen I say '\nas by a bear '\nI mean that the grip was stifF and massive\nrather than flexible, as opposed to cases where apparent palm and\nfinger-tips were felt. There were, at any rate, strong simultaneous\npressures on three different regions of my body, and with a force\nwhich impressed me at the time as being greater than my own.\nI was holding the hands of Professor Lodge and of Eusapia ;\nProfessor\nRichet, the only other person in the room, was holding the other hands\nof Professor Lodge and of Eusapia, and we were all standing round\nthe table. Professor Ochorowicz was outside the window, taking\nnotes, and no one else could possibly have been present.\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1894.\n\" Another phenomenon, on July 23rd is thus described in the\nnotes\n:\n\" '\nThen a tall candlestick with glass globe enclosing candle was\ncarried from spare table on to sitting table ; M. distinctly seeing it\ndescending in a wavy line down the gap in the shutters. This being a\nslender object in line of sight was easily obsei-ved, and M. saw no hand\ntouching it. It remained on table some time, L. feeling it there.'\n\"I wish to make it clear that the whole of this candlestick with the\ncylindrical glass shade around it was easily comprised in the belt of clear\nsky between the shutters, and remained fully in my sight, at about\neighteen inches from my face, for several seconds, moving gently the\nwhile. The rattle of the ill-fitting shade, as it vibrated in the air,\nwas heard by Professor Lodge and myself. In this case, and in\nseveral others described in the notes, I clearly witnessed objects\npoised and moving with no material hand or attachment.\n\" It may be well to point out that this plan which we adopted of\nconstantly verifying by direct appeals to each other, and then clearly\ndictating to the note-taker outside, each in ndent while it was actually\noccurring, introduces a special difficulty into the hypothesis of col-\nlective hallucinations. For instance, when we have the note (July\n21st), 'M. and L. holding both Eusapia's hands in air firmly . . .\nthe large table was by request of L. turned over on its back behind\nM. and left with its feet in the air,' we must have correctly dictated\nthe overturn of the table, which was heard from outside, and remained\nvisible when the candle was lit ; but must at the same time, on the\nhallucination hypothesis, have incorrectly stated that we were\nholding Eusapia's hands ; \u2014since she, instead of sitting between us as we\nsupposed, must have got up and left the circle, passed behind me to\noverturn the table, and returned and taken our hands before the light\nwas struck directly afterwards. There must have been no vague or\ngeneral hallucination on our parts, but hallucinations perfectly distinct,\nconstantly varied, and always the same for all the persons present.\n\" The hypothesis of a confederate finding access to this small room,\non a desert island, under Professor Richet's control, in which room,\nor on the verandah in front of which, we habitually lived, can\nonly be used as a subsidiary explanation. For besides the direct\nwriting, described by Professor Lodge, which occurred in full light\nof lamp or candle, many other phenomena occurred in light which\nenabled us to see each others' figures and faces so distinctly that\nwe could hardly have failed to notice any additional human\nbeing engaged in pulling our beards, patting our heads, slapping us\non the back, and so forth.\n\fNov., 1894.] Discussion of Professor Lodge's Paper. 339\n\" Some may think that the hands which we held as the medium's\nwere composed, not of hallucination, but of sawdust. It would, how-\never, be difficult to train a stuffed hand to perspire naturally,\nto mark time to an accordion, and to clench one's palm with its\nnails ; all which the small hand which I grasped undoubtedly did.\n\" Some persons, again, will no doubt think that one of us so-called\nwitnesses must have done the things himself. Against this my best\ndefence is, that as I have only sat four times with Eusapia I cannot\nhave done the things on the odd four hundred occasions or so on which\nthey have been reported to occur. A similar line of defence, I am\nglad to think, is open to everyone who has ever sat with her. I think\nthat we discussed on the island every possible or impossible way\nof producing these phenomena ; but I can see no explanation\nexcept the hypothesis that the energy stored in the medium's body\ncan be used either by her own spirit or by some other spirit to do\nmechanical work, not only in the usual way at the surface of her body,\nbut also at a distance of some feet from her apparent periphery.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick then said :\n\" As far as they go, my experiences\nwith Eusapia Paladino entirely confirm Professor Lodge, though they\ndo not go so far\u2014for the phenomena T witnessed were never, I think,\nsuch as could not have been produced by normal means had her hands\nalone been free, whereas for some of his experiences it seems necessary\nto assume her body also free. Still, my experiences were the most\nimpressive of the kind that I have ever had, though I have sat\nwith a good many mediums.\n\" Although the evidence, so far as my own experiences go,\nentirely depends on whether her hands were efficiently held, yet, if\nthey were so held, I see no means of avoiding the supposition that\na supernormal agency was at work, since I confidently reject the\nsupposition that any confederate was present in the room, or that\nsome of the observers aided her in any way. For the phenomena\nwhich impressed me most could not have been produced by means of her\nmouth or her feet ; for instance, a grasp resembling that of a hand\non the head cannot be produced by a foot, nor can a billiard ball or\na large heavy melon without a stalk be conveyed from the table\nbehind the medium to the table in front by her teeth (and all\nthese things happened in my experience), \u2014and besides, in cases\nwhich did seem conceivably to admit of any such explanation,\nit was excluded in subsequent trials by the securing of her feet and\nher mouth. Indeed, during the most important parts of the seances at\nwhich I was present, the feet were almost always held by the hands of\n\f340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1S94.\none or other of the investigators who placed himself under the table\nfor the purpose. M. Richet and M. Ochorowicz had come to the con-\nclusion that this was a more satisfactory method of control than even\nthe electrical apparatus described by Professor Lodge.\n\"The question then\u2014as regards my contribution to the evidence-\nis, could there be any mistake about the holding of the hands?\nAt the seances which impressed me most, it did not seem to me that\nI personally could be mistaken. I felt sure that I held the hand for-\nwhich I was responsible, that it was Eusapia's hand, that it had the\ntexture of her skin, that it was continuous with her arm and sleeve,\nand that it was her left hand, as could be verified by the position of\nthe thumb. And it may be observed in passing that it is not even\nnecessary to be assured of holding the hand continuously, provided\none has it at the moment the touch as of a hand is felt on the head\nor shoulder, or that an object, such as a melon, is touching one's face\nin its passage on to the table. At the time of these seances, ifc\nseemed to me absolutely impossible that T should have been deceived^\nand I certainly do not now know any method of deceptively\nproducing the sensations I had.\n\" At the first seance. Professor Sidgwick held the other hand, and\nhis conviction that he had it was, I think, as strong as mine that I\nhad the left hand, and under these circumstances we experienced various\ntouches and grasps which could only have been produced by a human\nhand or a good imitation of it, and this when, as I say, the mouth\nand the feet were fully accounted for. Similarly, at the last of our\nseries of seances, I again held the left hand, while the riglit was held\nby a French physician. Dr. Segard. At this seance, at which all\nthe usual phenomena occurred in abundance, I was not onlj\nconfident that I held the left hand well, but that, independently of\nthat, (for reasons which it would take too long now to go into) if any\nhand was free, it was the right hand. M. Segard was, however, quite\nconfident throughout\u2014and we continually asked him \u2014that he held\nthe right hand ; and not only so, but when in the course of the\nseance we lighted up in order to see more clearly the position of things,\nhe certainly was holding it. I think that the feeling of both\nDr. Segard and myself after the sitting was that, if the phenomena,\nwere not genuine, the other sitter had let go the hand, but that to\naccuse him of this was almost to accuse him of idiocy.\n\"To sum up then,\u2014although, if my own experiences had stood\nalone, I should have preferred to wait for further opportunities of\nobservation before laying them before the Society, I feel bound to\nsay that, as far as they go, they entirely confirm those of Professor\n\fNov., 1894] Discussion of Professor Lodge's Paper. 341\nLodge and Mr. Myers, and that I regard collusion or confederacy as\nout of the question.\"\nMr. W. Crookes spoke to the follo-sving effect :\n\u2014\n\" Through the kindness of Professor Lodge I have had an opportunity\nof reading a proof of his paper in advance, and it has occurred to me\nthat a few observations on certain diiferences which I have noted\nbetween the phenomena occurring in Eusapia Paladino's presence and\nthose which I used to see with D. D. Home, might interest the\nmeeting.\n\"In the first place, most if not all the occurrences with Eusapia\nseem to have taken place when she was in a trance, and the more\ncomplete the trance the more striking the phenomena. This was not\nalways so with Home. Certainly the two most striking things I ever saw\nwith him, the fire test and visible forms, were to be observed while he was\nentranced, but it was not always easy to tell when he was in that state,\nfor he spoke and moved about almost as if he were in his normal\ncondition ; the chief difl:erences being that his actions were more\ndeliberate, and his manner and expressions more solemn, and he\nalways spoke of himself in the third person, as 'Dan.'\n\" I several times saw the fire test, both at my own and at other\nhouses. On one occasion he called me to him when he went to the\nfire and told me to watch carefully. He certainly put his hand in the\ngrate and handled the red-hot coals in a manner which would have\nbeen impossible for me to have imitated without being severely burnt. I\nonce saw him go to a bright wood fire, and, taking a large piece of red-\nhot charcoal, put it in the hollow of one hand, and covering it with\nthe other hand, blow into the extempore furnace till the coal was\nwhite hot and the flames licked round his fingers. No sign of burning\ncould be seen then or afterwards on his hands.\n\" When he was not in a trance we frequently had movements of\nobjects in diflFerent parts of the room, with visible hands carrying\nflowers about and playing the accordion. On one occasion I was\nasked by Home to look at the accordion as it was playing in the\nsemi-darkness beneath the table. I saw a delicate-looking female hand\nholding it by the handle, and the keys at the lower end rising and\nfalling as if fingers were playing on them, although I could not see\nthem. So life-like was the hand that at first I said it was my sister-\nin-law's, but was assured by all present that both her hands were on\nthe table, a fact which I then verified for myself.\n\" The best cases of Home's levitation I witnessed were in my own\nhouse. On one occasion he went to a clear part of the room, and after\nstanding quietly for a minute, told us he was rising. I saw him slowly\n\f342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov..\nrise up with a continuous gliding movement and remain about six\nnches off the ground for several seconds, when he slowly descended.\nOn this occasion no one moved from their places. On another occasion\nI was invited to come to him, when he rose 18 inches off the ground,\nand I passed my hands under his feet, round him, and over his head\nwhen he was in the air.\n\" On several occasions Home and the chair on which he was sitting,\nat the table rose off the ground. This was generally done very de-\nliberately, and Home sometimes then tucked up his feet on the seat of\nthe chair and held up his hands in view of all of us. On such an\noccasion I have got down and seen and felt that all four legs were off\nthe ground at the same time, Home's feet being on the chair. Less\nfrequently the levitating power extended to those sitting next to him.\nOnce my wife was thus raised off the ground in her chair.\n\"Home always had a great objection to darkness, and we generally\nhad plenty of light. I tried several experiments on lighting the room.\nOnce I illuminated it with Geissler vacuum tubes electrically excited,\nbut the result was not satisfactory; the flickering of the light distracted\none's attention. Another time I lighted the room with an alcohol flame\ncoloured yellow with soda. This gave everyone a ghastly look, but the\nphenomena that took place were very strong, and I was told it was a\ngood light for the purpose. One of the best seances I ever had wa^\nwhen the full moon was shining into the room. The blinds and\ncurtains were drawn back and there was light enough to enable one to\nread small print.\n\"One of the most common occurrences at the seances consisted in\nmovements of flowers and light objects. Sometimes those present could\nsee fingers or a complete hand carrying things about, but frequently no\nvisible support was to be detected. The hands felt warm and life-like, and\nif retained would appear to melt away in one's grasp. They were never\ndragged away.\n\" One of the most striking things I ever saw in the way of move-\nments of light objects was when a glass water-bottle and tumbler rose\nfrom the table. There was plenty of light in the room from two large\nsalted alcohol flames, and Home's hands were not near. The bottle\nand glass floated about over the middle of the table. I asked if they\nwould answer questions by knocking one against the other. Immediately\nthree taps together signified 'Yes.' They then kept floating about six\nor eight inches up, going from the front of one sitter to another round\nthe table, tapping together and answering questions in this manner.\nQuite five minutes were occupied by this phenomenon, during which\ntime we had ample opportunity of seeing that Home was a passive\n\fNov., 1894.] Discussion of Professor Lodge's Paper. 343\nagent, and that no wires or strings, &c., were in use. But the idea of\nany such tricks was absurd, as the occurrence was in my own house,\nand no one could have tampered with anything in the room. Home\nnot having been in the room till we all came in together for the seance.\nOn another occasion I asked for a word to be written by a pencil in my\npresence without anyone's hand being near. A piece of paper, a pencil,\nand a small wooden lath were on the table. The pencil rose up over\nthe paper and seenied as if it were trying to write, and the lath went\nas if to steady it, but we were told the power was too weak to enable\nwriting to be done.\n\" I never noticed any sympathetic movements of Home's hands or\nbody when objects at a distance were being moved. I am certain\nthat in most cases, when Home was not in a trance, he knew no more\nwhat was going to happen than did any one else present. He was\nan excellent raconteur, and by no means kept silent. Frequently he\nwas looking another way, engaged in animated conversation with some\none at his side, when the first movements took place, and his attention\nhad to be called to them like the rest of us. He took a child-like\npleasure in anything that was going on, and he always declared he had\nno power whatever over the progress of the phenomena.\n\"General conversation was going on all the time, and on many\noccasions something on the table had moved some time before Home was\naware of it. We had to draw his attention to such things far of tener than\nhe drew our attention to them. Indeed, he sometimes used to annoy\nme by his indifference to what was going on. When things were going\non well, ample opportunity was generally given us to examine the\noccurrences at leisure, and frequently things would repeat themselves\nat request, or small objects, flowers, &c ,\nwould move about for many\nminutes passing from one to the other of those present. For my part\nI was always allowed to move about and examine what was taking\nplace as carefully as I liked. All that we were asked was that we\nshould not move suddenly. This was liable to stop the phenomena for\na short time.\n\"I quite agree with what Professor Lodge says as to strangers.\nThey are, I suppose, necessary evils, but some of my best seances have\nbeen spoiled by transparent and futile attempts at trickery on the part\nof strangers who had begged for an invitation. On one occasion every-\nthing seemed to promise a good sitting, and a very great man was\npresent at his earnest request. We sat for an hour with nothing\nhappening except sundry movements and noises, kicks and pushes,\nevidently made by my visitor. At length he left, and a message was\nreceived that '\nthey had been waiting till Mr. ceased to play the\n\f344 Journal of Society for Psychical Re.^earch. [Nov.,\nfool.' We then had an excellent seance. I subsequently heard that\nour visitor went about saying we were a credulous lot. He had\nsuccessfully taken us in with raps and movements, but Home was too\nclever to attempt to play any tricks in his presence.\n\" The drawback to accurate observation of Eusapia's phenomena\nappears to have been the very dim light in which most of the things\noccurred, rendering it necessary to take special precautions against\npo'^sible deception. Had the light been better the elaborate holdings\nof hands, feet, and head, would have been unnecessary, and the un-\navoidable suspicions that the person on the other side had liberated a\nhand, would have been impossible. Home always refused to sit in the\ndark.' He said that with firmness and perseverance the phenomena could\nbe got just as well in the light, and even if some of the things were not\nso strong, the evidence of one's eyesight was worth making some sacri-\nfice for. In almost all the seances I had with Home there was plenty\nof light to see all that occurred, and not only to enable me to write\ndown notes of what was taking place but to read my notes without\ndifficulty. Home was very anxious to let everyone present be satisfied\nthat he was not doing any of the things himself\u2014 too anxious, I some-\ntimes thought, for frequently he would interfere with the progress and\ndevelopment of what was going on by insisting that some sceptic\nor other should come round and take hold of his hands and feet\nto be sure he was not doing anything himself. At times he would\npush his chair back and move right away from the table when things\nwere moving on it, and ask those furthest from him to come round\nand satisfy themselves that he had nothing to do with the movements.\nI used frequently to beg him to be quiet, knowing that if he would not\nmove about in his eagerness to convince us of his genuineness, the\nstrength of the phenomena would probably increase to such a degree\nthat no further evidence would be needed that their production was\nbeyond the powers of the medium.\n\"During the whole of my knowledge of D. D. Home, extending\nover several years, I never once saw the slightest occurrence that\nwould make me suspicious that he was attempting to play tricks. He\nwas scrupulously sensitive on this point, and never felt hurt at any-\none taking precautions against deception. He sometimes, in the early\ndays of our acquaintance, used to say to me before a seance, ' Now,\nWilliam, I want you to act as if I was a recognised conjurer, and was\ngoing to cheat you and play all the tricks I could. Take every\nprecaution you can devise against me, and move about and look under\nthe table or where else you like. Don't consider my feelings. I shall\nnot be offended. I know that the more carefully I am tested the\n\fNov., 1894.] Discussion of Professor Lodge's Paper. 345\nmore convinced will everyone be that these abnormal occurrences are\nnot of ray own doings.' Latterly I used jokingly to say to him, ' Let\nus sit round the lire and have a quiet chat, and see if our friends are\nhere and will do anyrhing for us. We won't have any tests or\nprecautions.' On these occasions, when only my own family were\npresent with him, some of the most convincing phenomena took place.\n\"I think it is a cruel thing that a man like D. D. Home, gifted with\nsuch extraordinary powers, and always willing, nay, anxious, to place\nhimself at the disposal of men of science for investigation, should have\nlived so many years in London, and with one or two exceptions no one\nof weight in the scientific world should have thought it worth while to\nlook into the truth or falsity of things which were being talked about\nin society on all sides. To those who knew him Home was one of the\nmost lovable of men, and his perfect genuineness and uprightness were\nbeyond suspicion, but by those who did not know him he was called\n& charlatan, and those who believed in him were considered little\nbetter than lunatics.\"\nMr. Crookes concluded by expressing his satisfaction that so\neminent a man of science as Professor Lodge should endorse the\nconclusions he himself had arrived at so many years ago, and called\nthe attention of the meeting to the great courage exhibited by Mr.\nLodge in coming forward as he was doing.\nMe. Page Hopps endorsed Mr. Crookes' final remarks, and referred\nto similar phenomena witnessed by himself thirty years ago.\nMr. Baekworth asked if any observations had been made of\nchanges of temperature in the medium, by means of a clinical\nthermometer or otherwise.\nProfessor Lodge replied that he thought it best to leave\nobservations of this kind to medical men. He had not noticed special\nchanges of temperature in the hands held by him.\nProfessor Sidgwick, in closing the meeting, expressed his general\nconcurrence in what had been said by Mrs. Sidgwick with regard to\nthe experiences in which they had both shared. Although he kept\nhis mind open to suggestions as to methods of producing an illusory\nbelief that a medium's hand was being held when it was in fact\nfree, he felt bound to say that none of the methods of this kind\nthat were known to him appeared to him to afford an admissible\nexplanation in the present case : and the supposition of confederacy\nwas still more completely excluded by the conditions of the experi-\nments. His experiences therefore, so far as they went, tended to\nconfirm the more interesting results obtained by Professor Lodge and\nMr. Myers.\n\f346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The door could not be opened without\ndisturbing either R. or L. wlio were sitting near it. No unknown or\nunspecified person was in the room.\nSitters at small table joined liands round ;\nE., in very plain black\niStuff dress, had her back to the window all the first part of the time. A\nlighted paraffin lamp, with a shade, stood on the round table.\nAt the beginning, the position of observers was as shown in\nFirst the diagram. The unshod feet of E. were on a wooden apparatus\nposition.\n^j^g pedals of a harmonium encased in a box and having a\n^ complete partition between the two pedals so that one foot\ncould not possibly depress both. The depression of both\npedals shunted an electric bell out of a battery circuit,\n0 thereby keeping it quiet, whereas when either was allowed\nto spring up so much as an inch, the bell rang loudly.\nHer hands were held by R. and 0. respectively.\n9. 36.\u2014Under these conditions, in full lamplight, with the hands held,\nand feet on the machine, the black dress of E. being plainly visible\nall over to M. and L. who could see well under the table, the table tilted\nup at her end, wriggled about, and made a small quick jump completely off\nthe floor. This was then repeated. [These preliminary movements of\nthe light table always occur and are not devoid of interest, but as they\nare less secure of proof than later occurrences they will not henceforth be\nquoted.] The attention of L. was then called to protuberances of E.'&\ndress near her left leg, protuberances or gonflements which came and went.\nL. leaned over and touched one of these protrusions, about 12 inches from\nthe floor, and it instantly retreated. This was repeated several times,\nand the contact each time evoked a slight cry from the medium, but nothing\nwas grasped on this occasion. L. observed that both her feet were\ndistinctly visible on the machine, (which though tested before and after was\nnow quite silent), otherwise the protrusion looked and felt not unlike a\nraised and laterally protruded heel. [This occurrence is recorded as infor-\nmation, not as being first-rate evidence.]\n10.14.\u2014Raps on the table and tilts occurred which showed intelligence\nand permitted a change in the positifm of the observers, as\nSecond shown in second diagram.\nposition. rpj^g\nmachine was now soon dispensed with. L. held the\n1\nQ left hand of E. and had one of her feet on his. M. held the\nother hand and foot similarly ; and they continually kept each\nother informed as to the security of each. E. had no shoes on,\nL M and M. and L. had on soft slippers so that they could be sure of\n'\nreally feeling feet. There was often a twitching of her body\n^ and spasmodic jerking of her fingers but never sufficient to\ncause loss of control. The lamp was lowered.\n10.21.\u2014The first distinctly abnormal occurrence took place now, whem\n\f348 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

M. was touched lightly on\nthe back several times.\n10.24. \u2014Light lowered more, M. held both her hands in the air, L. held\nher head, and each held one foot. M. was again touched distinctly in the\nback.\nThe lamp now went out of itself. Dark.\n10.30.\u2014E.'s hands being well held by L. and M. on the table, M.'s\nbeard was distinctly pulled ; he was also touched on the shoulder and\n.clapped loudly on the back.\nBoth E.'s feet were now firmly held by M., and her hands were held by\nL. and M. as before. Several strong slaps occurred, and then the chair of\nM. was withdrawn from under him, and arrived on the table, knocking L.'s\nhead as it came.\n10.35. \u2014A light was now struck, and position of affairs observed. The\nlamp was then again lowered considerably.\n10.47.\u2014While L. held both feet and left hand, and M. held right hand,\nL. was touched on the right side and also on the knee.\n10.49. \u2014Nearly dark again.\n10.51. \u2014R. 's arm was grasped and M. pinched several times. While L.\nheld head and both hands, and M. held both feet, M. was touched as with\na hand on his arm and body.\n11.2. \u2014Hands and feet well held. R. was .scratched as by nails and\ntouched on head, M. was loudly .slapped on shoulder and strongly pinched,\nand the large table behind M. came violently part way towards us along the\nfloor.\n11.9. \u2014L. had whiskers pulled on left side as by fingers, and he was also\ntouched on shoulder and head ;\n(hands and feet held all the time.)\n11. 10. \u2014M. was distinctly pinched as by five fingers, one after the other\ntouching, and then all pinching simultaneously. E. had predicted in this\ncase what was going to be done by going through the appropriate\nmovements with her fingers, as they were being held con.stantly in the hand\nof M.\n\"\n11.14. \u2014M. was pushed very definitely [and many other such contacts\noccurred, which it would be tedious to narrate further]. Hands being held\nall round, the large table approached, answered questions by tilts, and rose\nV entirely in the air, being dimly visible to 0. It was entirely untouched.\n11.32. \u2014A sound as of smart friction of thumb and fingers in the air near\nE., whose hands were well held.\nL. then felt a hairy rough contact on the back of his head and shoulders,\non the side of his face and front of his forehead, as of something hairy\nmoving about and gently rubbing his head. Spoke of it first as like a hairy\ncat, afterwards as a fringe of a curtain. Conceived that he heard the rustle of a\nwindow curtain behind him and that its fringe was raised over and touching\nhis head. E. was completely under control all the time, and the position of\neverybody in the circle was well known. [This was a very curious and\nunmistakeable sensation, which could not possibly have been caused\nnormally by anyone sitting at the table.]\n\fNov., 1894.] Appemlix I. to Professor Lodges Paper.\n11.34.\u2014L., holding both hands of E., was distmctly touched as by a hand\non the shoulder and back of head. The hairy mass was again felt by him.\n11.36.\u2014M.'s chair was again drawn from under him and put on the\nmiddle of the table, and M. remained standing. The large table drew\nnearer ; hands and feet of E. well held.\n11.43.\u2014M. and L. both saw faint lights in the middle of the table, like\nfirefly scintillations, clear and sharp though of low luminosity.\nM. felt the hairy contact on his head while still standing up, and while\nL. had E.'s head touching his shoulder, her hands constantly held. [This\nrepetition under still better conditions was done to emphasise the fact that\nit was not the medium's hair that was being felt.] The large table again\nmoved and turned over on its side, turning over so as not to break the\nbattery close by. E. announced that \"John\" would write, and asked\nwhich table it should be on. R. selected large table, and asked for\ncross in red. E. said doubtful, and drew with M.'s finger on R.'s hand an\nirregular figure feeling like a circle with a knot attached [to show what would\nbe attempted].\nM. was touched twice on his right side, and felt a large hand on his\nback, also a hairy mass on his head, and a violent push in the back. E.\nplaced her head against M.'s arm, and M. felt the hairy contact on the top\nof his head clearly. .\n-d >\n12.4.\u2014M. and L. each holding one of E.'s hands firmly in the air, K. s\nhand was strongly grasped and held as by a hand while 31 was counted. At\nrequest of L. the large table then turned itself over on its back behind M.\nand was left with its feet in the air.\nA light was now struck, and the under surface of table (now turned\nupwards), was examined for marks. Nothing was found\nexcept joiners' lines which had been there before. The table \\\nwas now half raised, so that its legs were horizontal, and its\n( Q r\\\nupper surface shewed at once a large blue scrawl of this\nshape. Nocross was found [such as had been asked for above]. (\n[Although it is unlikely that so large and prominent a\nscrawl would have escaped previous observation, the proof of its immediately\nprevious absence is incomplete .]\nThere was now full light and the seance was understood to have stopped.\nBut E asked for a blue pencil, and when one was found and given her\nshe proceeded to cover the tip of her fore-finger with blue chalk. She then\ncave this finger to R. to hold, and with it extended she walked up to the\nvertically-standing top surface of the large table, and made near, but not\ntouching it, a couple of quick cross marks in the air. The blue had then\ndisappeared from her finger, and two large blue crosses, sharply drawn, not\nas with finger tip, were found at the back or far side of the table, viz., on\none of the sideboards of the under side which had been just previously\nexamined for such marks. There was no fresh mark on the surface in front\nof which she had made the gestures.\n[This is a remarkable phenomenon if genuine, but it has too much the\nsuperficial aspect of a conjuring trick to be altogether satisfactory.]\n\f350 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\n12.35. \u2014Sittings at the small table were now resumed, with a change of\nposition. The table was moved considerably further from the window and\nthe positions were as shewn. The shutter was more widely\nThird opened so as to admit light from the bright moon outside.\nvosition. rpj^g\ncandle of the recorder also gave some little lisht,\nbut the lamp inside the room was not lighted R. held both\nI.\nM arms and one hand of E., while M. held both feet and her\nother hand. R. then felt a hand move over his head and rest\non his mouth for some seconds, during which he spoke to us\nO with his voice muffled. The round table now approached.\nR.'s head was stroked behind. R. held both E.'s knees, still\nretaining one hand while M. held the other, and the round\ntable continued to approacli in violent jerks.\n]2.49. \u2014A small cigar box fell on to our table, and a sound was heard in\nthe air as of something rattling. R. was holding head and right hand ; M.\n,\nholding left hand, raised it in the air holding it lightly by the tips of its\nfingers, but with part of his own hand free. A saucer containing small shot,\n'(from another part of the room), was then put into this hand of M. in the\n^ir. A covered wire of the electric battery came on to the table and\nwrapped itself round R. 's and E. 's heads, and was pulled till E. called out.\nHenceforth R. held her head and body, M. kept one hand and both feet,\nwhile L. held the other hand, and in this position E. made several\nspasmodic movements, each of wliich was accompanied or followed by\nviolent movements of the neighbouring round table.\n12.57. \u2014The accordion which was on the round table got on to the floor\nsomehow, and began to play single notes. Bellier counted 26 of them and\nthen ceased counting. While the accordion played, E.'s fingers made move-\nments in the hands of both M. and L. in accord with the notes as if she were\nplaying them at a distance with difficulty. The lightly-touched quick notes\nwere also thus felt by L. with singular precision. Sometimes the touch failed\nto elicit a response, and this failure was usually succeeded by an interval of\nsilence and rest.\n1.5. \u2014E. being well held, M. heard a noise on the round table at his side,\nand turning to look saw a white object detach itself from the table and\nmove slowly through the clear space between his own head and E.

M. was repeatedly and\nvigorously pushed on the back while L. was trying to see what was touching\nliim [changing places with O. for the purpose]. L. could see M.'s\nback readily, but could not see anything upon it, though M. kept on\ncalling out that he was being pushed, and that things which pushed\nlike that must be visible. Soon afterwards the sitting was suspended\nand E. came out of the trance. During the latter half of the sitting,\nE. had taken one of M.'s fingers and drawn some scrawls with it\noutside R.'s flannel jacket, which was buttoned up to his neck. M. said:\n\" She is using me to write on you,\" and it was thought no more of. But\nafter the seance, when undressing, R. found on his shirt front, underneath\nboth flannel jacket and high white waistcoat, a clear blue scrawl ;\nand he\ncame at once to bedrooms to shew it.\n[The account of this sitting has been quoted at considerable length as a\nspecimen : it will not be necessary to quote all equally fully ;\nnor is it\nsuggested that all the incidents quoted are equally valid as evidence. It\nwas not the best sitting, but it was a good one, and it may be noted that\n(at 11.34) L. was distinctly touched as by a hand on the shoulder and the\nback of his head while he himself was holding both hands of Eusapia ;\nand\nthat twice (at 1.5 and at 1.17) a small object moved visibly through the air.]\nSecond Sitting, July 1894.\nSame persons present, but arranged differently at small table, as shown.\nNo one else was in the room. Bellier was outside the window taking notes.\nE. had her back to the window, in which a chair\nFirst Position. stood, and on it the chalet was placed beforehand.\n_2 ?L_ There was only a very small amount of light at first.\nM ^ selection of the events only is quoted, principally\n1 those in which L. was specially concerned.\nThe feet of Eusapia were placed without slippers\non the electric apparatus, so that neither foot could be raised an\ninch without ringing a bell ; her hands were wide apart and held\nquite distinctly, the left by L. and the right by M.\nVarious small phenomena occurred, and movements of the table, etc.\nM. felt the hairy contact on his head such as L. had felt on the 21st,\nalso a thick-feeling hand on his back, etc.\nUnder the above condition of holding, a couple of loud claps, as of free\nhands in the air, were heard. One of the window curtains was flung forcibly\nover the sitters. M. was clapped audibly on the back, and at the same\nmoment the chalet (musical box) was raised oflF a chair where it had been\nplaced, behind Eusapia, touched M. as it came, and stood upon the table.\nHands being still held it came next on to the chest of L., and then got on to\nthe ground. In this case it was not playing. R . was then told to hold his\nhand up free in the air, and the chalet was gently deposited in it. L.'s head\nwas now seized and forcibly squeezed and shaken, as if by two strong hands\n\f352 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\nor stumps ; and \"John \" was understood to claim the \" hairy mass \" as his-\nbeard, and to be rebuking L. for asserting it to be a curtain fringe. The\nchalet had been replaced on table, and, while Eusapia's hands were well held\nand the position of her head and mouth observed, it wound itself up and\nstarted to play. While playing it descended on to the floor. There it ran down,\nand stopped playing, but while still on the floor it wound itself up again and\nrose on to the table once more, playing as it came. Eusapia's hands were'\nunder perfect control all the time, and the foot apparatus was now tested\nand found to be working well.\nL. was then permitted to hold both arms and both feet (the foot apparatus\nbeing removed) and he was then touched twice on the back and grasped\ndistinctly on the left arm. E. then held up one of L.'s hands and with it\nmade two small movements, and at each movement a chair not far distant\ngrated along the floor as if pushed or pulled. (This sort of action occurred\nmany times and is very characteristic.)\nThe shutter was arranged to let in more moonlight.\nThe chair from behind E. now arrived on the top of table, and while there\nin full view rose up and down several times ; E.'s hands, under control, not\ntouching it, but making appropriate or sympathetic movements to-\ncorrespond.\nR. and L. now changed places so that L. could face\nSecond position. window and see if the things which were frequently\n0 touching M. were visible. R. held head and left hand\n^ and left foot of E. M. held right hand and foot. R. and\nO. saw things across the window : then L., leaning over\nj5 the table, saw, crossing the light of the window, a dark\nprotuberance stretching over from E. towards M.'s head\nand shoulder ; it looked like three or four large stiff' black feathers or ragged\nfingers, trying to reach M.'s shoulder and just not succeeding. The object\nthen drooped and seemed to touch M.'s forearm, and, at the same instant as\nL. saw the contact, M. exclaimed as feeling a touch, and said his arm and\nelbow had been touched and shaken. [This was a very distinct experience.}\nE. still well held, the curtain approached R., and he felt something hard\ninside it. M. received several slaps on the back, but L. could see nothing\nof what did it, though he could see M.'s back. Getting\nThird position (First tired of these numerous contacts, all got up.

The table then rose exactly as\nbefore, staying two seconds horizontally in the air.\nE. 's body shewed signs of efi'ort while this occurred,\nbut still the hand held by M. did not touch the table\nand the hand held by L. only lightly touched it. 'No one-\nelse touched the table at all. [Since only one foot was\nsafely accounted for it must be supposed that the other was free ;\nbut even so\nit appears to me impossible for any person to lift a table of this size and\nweight while standing up to it, with hands only on top, without plenty of\nleg action, and considerable strength and pressure of hands. It was quite\nbeyond any normal power of Eusapia. A tnan sitting at such a table can\nraise it by means of one knee and foot, but he cannot so raise while standing,\nwith his hands only on the top.]\nDimensions and weight of table are given under \" Preliminary Details.'\"\nO\nThird Sitting, Jidy 2oth.\nThe position of the three tables was altered so as to be more like what is\nhere shewn ; the second position of sitters being also represented (the first\nposition was the same, except that R. and L. were interchanged) :\u2014\nO R\nSmall Table M\nQ \" Chalet \" suspended to ceiling.\nE\nL. had suspended the \" chalet,\" with its lowest point 5 feet from the floor,\nto a hook in the centre of the ceiling, by a bit of string, to see what would\nhappen to it under these circumstances, and he had made sure that it was\ncompletely run down, so that it could not play till wound up. It hung at a\ndistance distinctly beyond Eusapia's normal reach : at least two feet beyond.\nLodge had entirely arranged the room as he wished, and kept special guard\nover it to see that no one entered or tampered with anything ;\nlocking the\ndoor immediately after the sitters were admitted.\nThe first experiment was the extraction of a^couple of halma-men out of\n\f354 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\na box without removing the lid ; but since the men in the box had not been\ncounted beforehand, this experiment must be rejected as uncertain.\n[There is no other record of the extraction of matter from a closed box by\nthis medium that I am aware of.] The second was the production of scent,\nsomething like verbena, on the medium's hands; but there was not sufficient\nevidence of the absence of such scent from the island. The large table\nbehind medium now moved along the floor, while medium was under\ncomplete control ; her hands, feet, and knees being held. Then an electric bell-\npush, which L. had arranged on round table, just within normal reach, was\ntouched so as to ring the bell. The square table was violently dragged about,\nand loud bangs occurred on it. Then Richet and Lodge interchanged places\n[so as now to correspond with the above diagram], and several times\nduring the next hour Lodge was touched, grasped, and pinched, while he\ndistinctly held both Eusapia's hands and feet. He also let one of his\nhands be held by Eusapia's two hands, feeling down her sleeves and\nhaving a light struck to assure himself that the holding was correctly felt,\nand under these conditions a distinct hand was applied to his right arm, and\nwhen he put his free {i.e., Ochorowicz-holding) hand to the place it was\ngripped momentarily too, giving a clear feeling of nails and of thumb and\nfingers. Also, while Lodge held both hands and feet, the large table was\nseveral times violently moved, and other clear movements of smaller objects\noccurred.\nThe agency was asked to wind up the suspended chalet, but reported\nthat it turned round [naturally] when the attempt was made.\nThe accordion, a candlestick, and other objects arrived on the table.\nEusapia now held both her hands on Lodge's head, and Myers held both her\nknees. She then said 5 times \" tira \" spasmodically, and at each utterance\nthe square table made a vigorous scrajjing movement along the floor towards\nus. This lasted 4 seconds as recorded by Bellier outside, from the evidence\nof his own ears and the watch in front of him.\nWhile Lodge held both the medium's hands on the table, and also her\nhead leaning over on to him away from the chalet, (see figure above), and\nwhile Richet held both her feet, the suspended chalet was heard to be\nwound partially up 3 times, with brief pauses, taking four seconds in all,\nas heard and recorded by Bellier. It did not now begin to play, but began\nto flap, as if its doors were trying to open. Soon it began to play and raps\nwere heard on it. While it played Eusapia's hands waved L's hands in the\nair in time with the music. It soon stopped, but was immediately re-wound\nand went on playing some time. While this was going on, the chalet began\nto swing and the string was heard to break, but instead of dropping on\nthe floor, the chalet was gently placed on M. 's head and thence on to the\ntable. [This phenomenon occurred under quite satisfactory conditions.]\nL. was told to hold one hand loosely against the skirt of Eusapia, still\nholding her two hands with the other, and he then felt his hand gripped\nquickly several times as by a hand through her dress. He had also several\ndistinct hand-grasps as from a bare hand coming from E.'s shoulder, both\nber real hands being at the time completely in his control. He did not\n\fNov., 1894.] Apiyendix I. to Professor Lodges Paper. 355\nsucceed in grasping one of these pseudo-hands ;\nthough other observers did\non other occasions. Attempt was now made to prolong one of these\npressures. A hand was felt on M.'s back and he began counting seconds.\nThe hand pressed at each count 5 times, and remained still up to 10 times,\nwhen it slapped audibly and disappeared. Observation made in light as to\ncorrect holding of Eusapia's real hands.\n[A great number of other phenomena occurred, but the above are\nsufficient to quote at present. This was the best sitting.]\nAfter the sitting there occurred a curious writing episode, in which the\nclean finger nail of Professor Richet, held by Eusapia, was made to act as a\nblue crayon and to leave a thick blue pencil mark when drawn thus along\nwhite paper in full candle light. This was done several times, and the\nformation of the last two of these marks was closely watched by all in the\nlight close to a candle. It appeared to L. as if the blue did not appear\ndh-ectly under the nail, but slightly on one side, as if some invisible\nprotrusion from the fingers of Eusapia (which themselves were about half\nan inch off the paper) were really producing it, but he does not vouch for\nthis detail and only records it as a memorandum for future observation.\n[The paper was certainly clean beforehand, and the marks could be seen\nbeing formed.]\nFourth Sitting, July 2Qth.\nOn 26th July a sitting was held in which Ochorowicz took notes outside\nthe window, Bellier having left the island ;\nand the observers were Richet,\nMyers, and Lodge. The room was again arranged and guarded by Lodge,\nwho again locked the door when the other two observers had entered with\nEusapia. The first incident of note was some extremely loud and dangerous-\nsounding bangs on the square table and on the small table at which they\nsat. These bangs were louder than could be made with hand blows [and\nwere sufficient to cause alarm for the safety of the hands among which they\nsometimes occurred].\nL. and M. distinctly and simultaneously saw a small bright light rapidly\nmoving in front of them above the table, like a spark or a firefly. The\nsmall table rose high into the air in fair light, and remained there barely\ntouched by E. on the top, while eleven was counted.\nAn arm chair in the window, four feet of clear space intervening\nbetween it and the back of Eusapia, now began to move. It was very\nvisible to Lodge and to all; the shutters being open and sky-light glinting on\nthe back of the chair. It was seen to approach and otherwise move a\nfew inches several times, it also made intelligent visible tilts in reply to\nquestions. Eusapia was well held, and all conditions perfect. No one was\nnear the chair. , , t.\n\u2022\nj\nThe window curtain, five feet away from everybody, and behind\nEusapia, now rose and swelled out across the window. M. now held Eusapia's\nhead, and at the same time L. saw the outline of a large face or mask over\nthe window, but it might have been made out of the edge and fringe of the\nswollen curtain. It remained there 20 or 30 seconds, and an imitaticm\n\f366 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\n'\n' hand \" moved about and touched the nose of the face to call attention to it.\nThen the curtain suddenly fell back into its ordinary shape and quietude.\nThe window was only slightly open, and there was no wind such as could\ndistort the curtain thus ; nor was there anyone concealed in the room.\nL. had tied a fan belonging to the medium under the table before the\nsitting, without mentioning the fact ; this was now wrenched forcibly away\nfrom its fastenings and flung upon the table.\nRichet was grasped or clutched as by a large hand with open fingers\napplied to his head, he himself at the time holding both the hands of the\nmedium.\nEusapia's hands being well held, Myers' wallet with books and papers\nwas lifted from the floor on to the table. It weighed 12 pounds.\nNoise as of key being fumbled in the door, and Ochorowicz from outside\nasked who was unlocking the door. Eusapia's hands were well held and\nno one was near the door. The clear space of several feet near door was\nplainly enough visible. Blows occurred on the door. The key then arrived\non the table, [and was felt there by L.] It disappeared again, and was\nheard to be replacing itself in the door with a sound as of the door being\nlocked (or unlocked) ; then the key came again on to the table into Richet's\nhand and stayed there. (At the beginning of the seance the door had been\nlocked, and at the end it was still locked ;\njudging by sound, it had\nj)robably been unlocked and locked again during this episode. The door\ncertainly remained shut all the time.) Richet saw an indistinct black\nsquare-looking object which seemed to prolong the key when it was brought\ntowards his hand.\nThere was light enough to see the position of everybody's normal hands\nall the time on this occasion, and we were sitting some four or five feet\ndistant from the door. [It was a perfectly distinct phenomenon.]\nRichet next saw something detached, like a bird in the air, going to M.'s\nhead. At the instant he saw it touch, M. called out that he was touched on\nthe head.\nL. ,\nR., and M. then all saw the curious imitation-hand or feather\nfingers stretching horizontally over the vertical gap between the half open\nshutters : a thing which L. had several times seen before.\nM. was seized from behind while standing, and vigorously pulled and\nshaken about ; while all four were standing holding hands round the table.\nL. saw him moving and felt a transmitted pull. A loaf and other objects\nfrom the bufi\"et hard by arrived on the table, and a pile of five plates.\nOur small table was in front of the bufiet. Evei-ybody was now standing\nup, and observers were getting tired, so we asked to stop, but agency\ninsisted on continuing. Statement made that the medium needed re-\nfreshment, but the agency said it could see to that. A gurgling noise was\nheard as if the medium was drinking from a bottle, and directly afterwards\na decanter of water which had been on a top shelf of the buffet arrived\non the table ; then it rose again to the medium's mouth, where it was felt\nhorizontally by Richet, and again she drank. It then came again on to the\ntable, and stayed there.\n\fNov., 1894.] Appendix II. to Professor Lodge's Paper. 357\n[There was so much locomotion in this seance that it is useless to \u00bbive\n.a plan. The position of buffet B and escritoire W, of door and window, is\nshown in plan at beginning of this Appendix. Most of the sitting and\nstanding was near the buffet.]\nMedium now conducted the standing group to near the writing desk in\nthe corner, and made three little movements with her held hand. They\nseemed to take effect and tilt the desk backwards, after a very short but\nappreciable interval. Then she moved further away and repeated the action\n;\nthe same movement of the bureau occurred, but with more delay. Then\nonce more, this time two metres from the desk ; and the interval elapsing\nbefore the response was now greater, perhaps as much as two seconds.\nOliver J. Lodge.\nNote. \u2014The following written statement was made by Dr. Uchorowicz,\n\u2022who acted as note-taker during this sitting.\n\" Je certifie que tous les hruita entendus par les assistants dans la chambre\nou a eu lieu la seance ont ete entendus par moi en dehors dn cerde et en dehors\n\u2022de la chambre.\"\n(Signed) J.

TO PROFESSOR LODGE'S PAPER.\nOn some Appliances needed pgr a Psychical Laboratory.\nAssuming that the facts here recorded, when taken in conjunction with\na multitude of similar facts vouched for by other observers, suffice to\nestablish the existence of a class of physical phenomena not yet recognised\nby science, it is natural to suppose that they are but the foreshadowings\nof a mass of new knowledge, i\nthat they are the early stages of a whole\nbody of science. Such has usually been the past experience of the human\nrace in connexion with a new department of observation, and until the\nAttempt is made to develop our knowledge of these phenomena on scientific\nlines, we cannot tell whether or no that experience is to be repeated in this\n\u2022case also.\nThe investigations are on one side more difficult and troublesome than\nare ordinary physical experiments, because they involve a person as a chief\ninstrument of research ; and this person requires humane and cautious\ntreatment of a kind quite different from that accorded to ordinary apparatus.\nBut although this is the case with the chief instrument, there are a number\nof subsidiary pieces of apparatus necessary for the investigation, of a kind\nnot very different from those needed in any physical or chemical research ;\nand if the observations are to go on easily and well, special appliances must\nbe contrived and arranged conveniently for use, precisely as is done in any\nproperly fitted laboratory.\n1 In using the word \"new \" here I would be understood to use it in the sense in\nwhich biologists speak of a \"new species\"; not meaning that it has just been\n\u2022created, nor even that it has never been used by man for decorative or nutritive\npurposes, but in the sense that now for the first time it is being recorded by orthodox\nand organised science for future study.\n\f358 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894.\nIt has already, doubtless, been realised that one of the needs of] the\nfuture is a psychical laboratory specially adapted for all kinds of experi-\nmental psychology and psycho-physics, and I believe that such laboratories\nalready exist in several countries ; but I proceed to indicate a few\nadditional pieces of apparatus such as are suggested by the demands of the\npresent enquiry.\nOne of the chief needs is a well arranged registering balance, with its\nplatform level with the Hoor, so that the medium's chair can be placed upon\nit with perfect and obvious security. The same platform might be arranged\nto indicate horizontal forces as well as vertical ones. The actual movements\nshould be small and imperceptible ; it is the force which should be registered,\nin order to determine the nature and locality of reactions experienced by\nthe body of the medium.\nThe registration should occur on a drum driven by the standard clock of\nthe place, which should have a dial visible to the note-taker, perhaps tO'\nexperimenters also, so that there be no question about diflerences of time ;\nand the same clock should beat audible seconds for convenience of rapid\ntime-estimates.\nWhile so much is unknown about the subject, it would be necessary at\nfirst to take a number of observations more or less at random, until it is\nfound out which are the operative conditions and which may be ignored.\nThen, in addition to the medium's weight, it will be well to take his or her\ntemperature, muscular exertion, pulse, breathing, &c., &c. ; and all this\nwould be best done in some automatically registering manner by apparatus\noutside the room, and actuated through a single thin strand of wires from\nthe person of the medium, arranged not to incommode him or imj^ede his\nmovements.\nThe entire record might be made on one large drum or paper-roll, on\nwhich also a hand-worked stylus could record the instant of the various\nphenomena. If worth while, indeed, not only the time, but the nature of\nthe phenomenon also could be indicated, by an arrangement like Cowper's\nwriting telegraph. The chart exhibiting all these events simultaneously\nrecorded could hardly fail to yield instruction to subsequent leisurely\nstudy.\nUntil more is known it may be well also to take some simple data, before\nand after the seance, from the sitters also ; and unless the apparatus is\nconveniently arranged in an ante-chamber for doing this quickly, it is sure\nto be overlooked.\nIt is probably specially desirable to record the muscular swellings of the\nmedium, say by the yield of slight elastic collars round the principal muscles,\nso as to ascertain what sort of exertion is needed for each class of distant\nmovement, and where each exertion is localised.\nOther devices of a more purely mechanical kind could be made to replace\nthe \"tables\" and \"chairs\" of the ordinary seance room. A table is\nevidently convenient to mediums because it permits contact of both hands\nand feet ; but this renders it unsatisfactory to investigators. A sort of table,\ni.e., a thing standing on the floor and yet reachable by hands, could be\neasily made so as to ring a bell in its own cavity whenever it was raised\n\fNov., 189-1.] Appendix II. to Professor Lodge's Paper. 359\nfrom the floor nnthotit pressure under any of its feet ; but if it experienced\npressure on its feet, as it does when standing on the floor for instance, then\nthe bell could be silent.\nThe same sort of plan, extended underneath its boards, could gradually\nshow the locality of the raising force as applied to the table ; and a balance\nunder the table could perhaps indicate where the reaction was, supposing\nthat it were not on the medium.\nIf so elaborate a plan were necessary, it would be possible to arrange\nthat the floor was chequed out into square-foot-blocks, all apparently steady,\nbut all really recording their load on one drum by means of a carbon-cloth\nrheostat underneath each. The tops of the blocks, if smoked or whitened,\ncould indicate upon which of them the table or the medium had rested, and\nthe record on the drum would shew where and when the reaction force had\nbeen applied. It may be possible to get the locality of the reaction force by\na simpler means than this, but such an arrangement as the one indicated\nwould be feasible in a permanent laboratory ; and it might not be safe to\nassume, without proof, that the locality must necessarily be the same for\nevery kind of medium.\nIt must, however, be remembered that the experiment room should not\nact on the medium in a repellent manner ; it is probably well that all\nmechanical devices be more or less concealed under a superficial aspect of\ncomfort and ordinary homeliness.\nAnother, or perhaps the same, seance room should be arranged with special\nreference to its optical properties, with the especial object of obtaining as\nmuch light as possible of a kind unobjectionable to the medium. Thus it\nis sometimes stated that they do not mind phosphorescent light. If so, the\nwalls and ceiling could be painted with phosphorescent paint.\nIt is sometimes said that though mediums object to sudden changes of\nluminosity, they do not so much mind a slow change even in the direction\nof increase. If so, a gas or electric lamp could be arranged automatically\nto keep on raising itself slowly and imperceptibly, at the same time\nretaining the power of being turned down occasionally whenever a demand\nfor less light is made. Occasions would probably arrive when the increased\nillumination would pass unnoticed, especially if the phenomena were\noccurring easily, and then accordingly the sitters could get an unusually good\nview.\nBut a still better device may be to arrange a room so that it shall be\nflooded with invisible ultra-violet light, sufficient for a constant series of\nphotographs to be taken of its interior by a clockwork device outside.\nPinhole photography would be best, as no special focussing is then\nnecessary, and the perspective is correct ; but the exposures might have to\nbe too long.\nA number of cameras could look into the room through holes in the\nwa Is, and silently record its state at regular short intervals on a long ribbon,\nwith the times marked. They could either go continuously, or they could\n\"be started by the note-taker or one of the observers pulHng a string before\nthe occurrence of any special event, of the probable coming of which an\nexperienced observer is usually aware.\n\f360 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1894..\nA method of admitting ultra-violet light in considerable quantity, on\nwhich a few years ago I made some preliminary experiments, is to have\nthe ceiling of the room made of a great tank or set of tanks filled with\nammonio-sulphate-of-copper solution, open to the sky ;\nand to sit in the\ndaytime. A sufBcient thickness of this substance stops the visible but\ntransmits some of the photographic solar rays. Perhaps a better and cheaper\nplan is to fit the room with plentiful north and north-sky windows glazed\nwith black quartz, or some dark varieties of fluor spar. And in this case\nartificial light on the other side of the windows might serve for night\nsittings ; but an arc-light is an exceedingly feeble substitute for country\ndaylight, and it is well to employ somewhat brilliant ultra-violet \"illumina-\ntion\" in order to be able to get results with rapid exposures and avoid,\nblurring.\nOther devices, such as smoked surfaces, wet clay, etc., for obtaining an\nimprint of the \" hands,\" and other abnormal protuberances, with registering\nthermometers for ascertaining their temperature, will readily suggest them-\nselves as soon as a serious study of these things is contemplated ;\nand no\nmore well-developed \"mediums\" ought to be wasted in fruitless efforts to\nobtain scientific recognition for the phenomena which their organisms are\nable to exhibit.\nThe result of my experience is to convince me that certain phenomena\nusually considered abnormal do belong to the order of nature ;\nand, as a\ncorollary from this, that these phenomena ought to be investigated and\nrecorded by persons and societies interested in natural knowledge.\nOliver J.

Osgood Mason, A.M., M.D.\nMiss M., 22 years old, of Irish parentage, was born in New York,\nand was a teacher in the public schools. She had dark hair, heavy\neyebrows, and rather a pasty and unhealthy appearance. On her way\nhome from school, July 13th, 1870, she received a shock by seeing an\naccident. I first saw her late in the evening of the same day. She\nwas lying upon a sofa, her hair and dress in great disorder, and her\nwhole appearance perfectly wild. She was startled at the slightest\nnoise, and every few minutes she screamed at the top of her voice,\nand with the most terror-stricken look upon her face, at some fearful\nvision which was before her, and in which she saw a dear friend, who\nwas really at that moment sitting by her side, fall from some high\nplace, by which she was supposed to be bruised and mangled m a\nshocking manner.\nA similar state of things continued during the three following\ndays, when, rather suddenly, paralysis appeared.

Began to be sleepy in five or six minutes ;\neyelids quivered and\nbegan to droop and very soon she went into an unconscious condition,\nbut some nervous action of the hands continued. She slept fifteen\nminutes and then awoke suddenly. She smiled, looked brighter, and\ndeclared she felt greatly rested and refreshed, as though she had had\n\"two nights' sleep.\"\nJuly 31st. \u2014Patient is decidedly better\u2014has had no attacks of\nscreaming nor of unconsciousness. The paralysis is the same as before.\nHypnotised by holding the thumbs and the steady gaze\u2014she slept as\non the previous occasion, but much more quietly. During sleep I\nmade a single, firm, rapid pass down the outside of the paralyzed leg,\nfrom above the knee to the foot. Patient awoke suddenly with a\nstart and an exclamation : asked sharply what I had done to her leg\n\u2014\ndeclared that I had cut it, and looked suspiciously about for the knife.\nI assured her that ho instrument of any kind had been used, and sug-\ngested that she should try to move her limb. She moved it readily.\nShe then put down her hand, and, pinching her affected leg, exclaimed\nwith great surprise, \" And I can feel, too !\n\" I made a few more passes,\nand then, giving her my hand, I asked her to rise. She did so, and\nstood bearing her weight fairly upon both feet. She then took a step\nor two, very hesitatingly at first, as if doubting her ability to do it\n;\nbut at last she walked all about the room unassisted, as well as if\nnothing had been the matter. Every trace of paralysis had disappeared\nand did not return.\nAugust 1st. \u2014Patient walked into the room unassisted, looked\nbright, had slept well ; still there was a strangeness in her look, and\nher friends reported that, contrary to her usual manner, she was\npetulant, fault-finding, and unreasonable. Hypnotised, she went to\nsleep easily, and, after allowing her a short sleep, I made two or three\nrapid passes upward across her forehead to arouse her. She awoke\nsuddenly and complained of headache, which very soon passed away\nand, on being asked how she felt, she replied :\n\" I wonder how people\nfeel who have been in a trance. I feel as though I had been in a\n\fDec, 1894.] JouTiial of Society for Psychical Research.\ntrance.\" Then, as if suddenly realising her surroundings, she ex-\nclaimed :\n\" How did I come to be in this room, and why am I in this\nhorrid dress 1\" and she went on to say that she should have been in\nthe room where I found her on the evening of my first visit, and\ndescribed the dress she then wore as the one she should have on now.\nIn short, she had no recollection of anything that had occurred since\nthe evening of July 13th\u2014the day she was taken sick : she calls that\nyesterday and all the intervening time is a blank.\nAugust 2nd.\u2014Patient has slept well and has apparently been clear\nin mind.\nAugust 12th.\u2014Patient has not seemed so well\u2014is again strange,\npetulant and unreasonable. She reads however, writes and amuses\nherself ; has not been altogether right, her friends say, since the 2nd\nof the month. Hypnotized, and, after a short sleep, awoke her by\nquick passes across her forehead. The whole time since August 1st is\na blank. She calls to-day Friday, July 1.5th. She was taken sick on\nWednesday, July 1-3 th ; the day I awoke her first is Thursday, and\nto-day is Friday. It is all right to her that way and in no other.\nFrom this time on there were no further manifestations of the\npeculiarities which had characterised her illness, nor any further lapses\nin time or consciousness. She was however imder my observation for\nseveral weeks, and I also gave her occasional treatment by hypnotism.\nDuring this later stage of her case, and after all abnormal condi-\ntions had seemingly disappeared, I was convinced that my patient\nwas still what might properly be called a \" Sensitive.\" During her\niUness I had observed decided indications of this heightened or supra-\nnormal power of perception. On my first attempt to hypnotize her,\non making the passes as usual four or six inches from the surface of\nthe body, she screamed with pain as though a powerful battery had\nbeen applied, and it was only at a distance of four or five feet that the\npasses were at all comfortable or soothing. I also found that pointing\nmy fingers at her from a distance\u2014as across the room\u2014produced con-\nvulsive muscular action. Thinking at first it was only \" expectation\n\"\nwhich induced this action, I tried the experiment when she was not\naware of my presence\u2014when her back was turned to me\u2014and even\nthrough a closed door, with the same result.\nI now instituted the following experiments :\n\u2014\nFirst.\u2014Taking an old-fashioned copper cent, I wrapped it neatlj\nin a bit of ordinary tissue paper ; this was folded in another covering\nof the same material, and so on until it had acquired six entire cover-\nings of tissue paper, and was a little, soft, oval, innocent-looking\npackage, quite convenient for my purpose.

I took a chair as I passed in, and,\nplacing it beside the lounge, I sat leisurely down and took her right\nhand in mine, in such a manner that the little package was between\nour palms and in close contact with both. I remarked upon the\nweather and commenced the routine duty of feeling her pulse with my\nleft hand. A minute or two was passed ;in banter and conversation\nintended by me to thoroughly engage her attention, when all at once\nshe commenced to wipe her mouth with her handkerchief, and spit and\nsputter with her tongnie and lips, as if to get rid of some offensive\ntaste. She then looked up suspiciously at me and said, \" I wonder\nwhat you are doing with me now\" ; then suddenly pulling her hand\naway from mine, she exclaimed :\n\" I know what it is ;\nyou have put a\nnasty piece of copper in my hand.\"\nSecond.\u2014I took two clean, new bottles, exactly alike, with new\ncorks, and put a small dot of ink in one of the corks so as to be able\nto distinguish it. I then filled the bottle with the unmarked cork\nwith plain water from the fawcet in my office. Immediately after I\ndrew a goblet of water from the same fawcet, and, placing it on my\ndesk, I brought all my fingers together in a clump, and then held them\nfor a minute or two over the goblet as near as possible to the water but\nwithout the slightest contact. \" This it was and nothing more \" with\nwhich I filled the second bottle, having the dot in the cork.\nI then wrapped the bottles separately in thick white paper, put them\nin a satchel, and took them with me on my visit to my patient.\nDuring the visit I produced the bottles, taking care that my patient did\nnot see them\u2014much less distinguish the corks. I poured out a small\nquantity of the plain water and desired her to taste it, and then asked\nher what she supposed it to be. She repUed that she could taste\nnothing but simple water. I then took a portion of the water from the\nmarked bottle and desired her to swallow it ; and on asking her the\nsame question, she replied that that also was water, but that it was\npeculiar. It was not exactly like aerated water, but that conveyed the\nbest idea she was able to give of how it differed from ordinary\nwater. It had a sparkle which she felt on her tongue and all the way\ndown as it passed into her stomach. No matter how or in what order\nthe two waters were given, she never failed to distinguish which it\nwas, and she always described the difference in the same way. Five\nyears later I accidentally met this lady in the cars with her husband\nand two children. She lived far out of town : the meeting was only\nfor a moment, and there was no opportunity of learning her history\nsince I last saw her, nor anything of her psychical condition.\n\fDec, 1894.] Journal of Society for FsycMccd Research. 365\nA friend of hers recently told me that, after Miss M.'s recovery\nand return to her school duties, on one occasion she was suddenly\nstartled and passed into a condition similar to but less violent than\nthe one just described as the commencement of her illness ;\non that\noccasion another teacher, a friend of hers, dipped a handkerchief in\nplain cold water and applied it to her lips. She quickly became calm,\nbut at once seized the handkerchief and sucked the water from it\ngreedily, declaring that it \"sparkled \" in her mouth like the water Dr.\nMason used to give her.\nOASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nS. 14. From Mr. T. Barkworth.\nJanuary 25th, 1893.\nThe following statements referring to physical phenomena of an\nunusually decided character are made by the \"medium\" herself, and\nby a friend of hers who is also a relative of my own. The \" medium \"\nis a young lady utterly unversed in psychical research generally, and in\nspiritism in particular. She struck me as possessing unaffected sim-\nplicity and candour. The other witness has been known to me from\nchildhood, and I can vouch for her veracity in all respects.\nIt will be noticed that there is a discrepancy in dates between the\ntwo statements, fortunately of no importance, but as to which neither\nwitness will give way. It only serves to shew the importance of\nrecording events of this kind on the spot. Miss Masterman, how-\never, writes :\u2014 \" I might have given a few other occurrences . . .\nbut I suppose it is best only to state those which I could swear to.\"\nOne of the most singular circumstances of the case is the little impor-\ntance both ladies seem to have attached to the phenomena themselves,\nso much so that there is no certainty, from their recollection, of dates\nor of the identity of other witnesses present on particular occasions.\nThis is most unfortunate in the case of the table moving without\ncontact. A clergyman was thought to have been present, but he\nwrites to me, \"I heard of the occurrence to which you refer, but this\nparticular manifestation did not take place in my presence. . .\n.\nThat the phenomenon occurred, however, I cannot doubt, several per-\nsons being present at the time, and bearing witness to the fact.\"\nI may still, therefore, at a future time, obtain further confirmation\nof this extraordinary event.\nThe apparition described will be considered by most persons as\npurely subjective, in view of the percipient's condition at the time,\n\f366 '\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research, [mc^^m^.\nand, if so, it is an interesting example of a subjective hallucination\nbeing transferred, or shared by two people.\nT.B.\nStatement of Miss Paetoiv, 24, Queen Anne's Grove, Bedford Park, taken\ndown from her verbal answers to my questions on December 7th, 1892, and\nsubsequently revised and signed by her.\nThe phenomena to be described first appeared about May, 1890. I had\nnot previously given attention to the subject, nor read anything about it,\nand had never been to any seances.\nThe first attempt was made when some friends, including L.M., came\nover for the day. We began by table turning, and after the other friends\nleft, L. M. and I went on alone, the influence growing stronger. I tried for\nraps in answer to questions and got them from the table or on the floor near\nby. These questions were mostly concerned with the future. Not bemg\nacquainted with any alphabetical or other code, the questions were limited\nto such as admitted of being answered by a simple \"Yes,\" or \"No.\" No\nperson was named as communicating agent. Raps were heard freely at\nnight when I was alone in bed. As to movements of obiects, beside those\nwhich were produced when my hands were on the table, it moved on two or\nthree occasions without contact at all ; and once, with contact, it tilted so\nviolently as to throw L. M. off when she was sitting on it. This was a four-\nlegged table. On another occasion a dining-room table stood on end, and\nonce a small table climbed on to a bed with only my hands on it. At other\ntimes the chair I was sitting on moved, carrying me with it. There was no\nfeeling of trance except on one occasion, and then just as I was sinking into\nit, I was recalled by a scream from my friend who saw what was about to\nhappen. There was no exercise of the will on my part in producing the\ndifferent phenomena. I have never been hypnotised nor have I ever been\nhysterical. The experiments were continued for about five months, but had\nto be discontinued in consequence of the suffering to health which they\ncaused, being followed by severe headache and nervous prostration. They\nhave not since been resumed.\nI have tried j)lanchette which writes readily for me, but even this pro-\nduces headache. I have once tried the crystal, but without result.\nI suffered considerable alarm at the time these occurrences were in\nprogress, particularly when in bed at night, and this feeling was increased by\nthe\u00b0raps which came at that time. Thus my rest was broken and my health\nsuffered in consequence.\nThe power increased with use, and since practice has been given up it\nseems to have ceased.\nWith regard to further psychical experiences occurring to her. Miss\nPaetow adds :\n\u2014\nOn one occasion, when seated at the piano, my sister being in the room,\na well-defined hallucination of a man (unrecognised) entered, walked out\nand ran rapidly upstairs. His steps were heard before he became visible and\nafter ceasing to be so. This hallucination was, I believe, shared by my sister,\n\fDec, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nmore or less. It could not have been a real man, as it entered through the\nsolid waU. I was overwrought at the time, and in an excitable and nervous\ncondition in consequence of the other experiences, but was not otherwise\nout of health.\nThe above statements, which I have carefully read over, contain the\ninformation verbally given by me to Mr. Barkworth and are all quite\ncorrect. ^ ^\nMabel E. Paetow.\nMiss Masterman writes :\n\u2014\nDecember Uth, 1892.\nThe first time I saw Miss Paetow turn a table was in the autumn of\n1890 about October. I and a few friends were at her house one afternoon,\nand the subject of table turning having been started, five of us .stood\nround a small three-legged table in the usual manner, placing our hands\nupon it-none of us knowing at the time that she possessed any power of\nthe kind On our asking the table which of us it preferred, it tilted\nalways in her direction ; we therefore left her alone with it. With only one\nfinger placed lightly upon it, it moved quickly into the next room, which\nwas a bedroom, and at her request climbed on to the bed, laid down and\n<rot up again, failing however to reach the ground from the bed. It also\ntried to climb up her, standing on her foot with one leg.\nWe tried these experiments over and over again at different times on\ninto the spring of the next year, and her power increased very much. I\nhave seen her move a moderately heavy table about 36 in. square with one\nfin-er upon it, letting it fall on to the ground, and then with her finger\nplaced lic^htly in the centre, and two of us pulling her behind to prevent\nher using\u00b0any force, it would leap up again with a bound.\nOn one occasion five or six of us sat with her round a dmmg table with\nour hands on it. It moved so violently backwards and forwards that it\ntore a hole about five or six inches long in the carpet.\n, -.^ .\nI have also seen a large heavy round table move at her request without\nany contaet whatever. About four of us have sat round at some distance\noff and she has asked the table to move towards the one it likes best. It\nhas at once walked quickly up to her, almost pushing her backwards\nI have also sat on the same table presshig on it with all my might, and,\nwith her one hand upon it, it has leaped upwards and thrown me violently\non to the ground. We have asked questions from time to time and received\nanswers, both by taps with one of the legs, and also by knocks in the centre\nof the table. Her famUy had no intention then of leaving their house.\nShe asked the table if they were going to leave, the answer was Yes.\n\" In a very short time V \" Yes.\" In a few weeks, for reasons which they\ncould not then have known, they found it advisable to leave their house.\nMost of the questions, however, were foolish, and we never got beyond the\nanswers\n\" Yes \" \"No \" or \" Don't know.\" The chair Miss Paetow has sat\nin has also moved and slipped gradually from under her, and my own has\nsometimes done the same when sitting with her.\nLouisa Masterman.\n\f368 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

A^l Pn From Prince Victor Duleep Singh.\nIn the following case the experience of the percipient seems to\nhave been on the line between illusion and hallucination.\nHighclere Castle, Newbury, November 8th, 1894.\nOn Saturday, October, 1893, I was in Berlin with Lord Carnarvon. We\nwent to a theatre together and returned before midnight. I went to bed,\nleaving, as I always do, a bright light in the room (electric light). As I lay in\nbed I found myself looking at an oleograph which hung on the wall opposite\nmy bed. I saw distinctly the face of my father, the Maharajah Duleep\nSingh, looking at me, as it were out of this picture ; not like a portrait of\nhim, but his real head. The head about filled the picture frame. I continued\nlooking and still saw my father looking at me with an intent expression.\nThough not in the least alarmed, I was so puzzled that I got out of bed to see\nwhat the picture really was. It was an oleograph common-place picture of a\ngirl holding a rose and leaning out of a balcony, an arch forming a back-\nground. The girl's face was quite small, whereas my father's head was the\nsize of life and filled the frame.\nI was in no special anxiety about my father at the time, and had for some\nyears known him to be seriously out of health ; but there had been no news\nto alarm me about him.\nNext morning (Sunday) I told the incident to Lord Carnarvon.\nThat evening (Sunday) late on returning home. Lord Carnarvon brought\ntwo telegrams into my room and handed them to me. I said at once, \" My\nfather is dead.\" That was the fact. He had had an apoplectic seizure on the\nSaturday evening at about nine o'clock, from which he never recovered, but\ncontinued unconscious and died on the Sunday, early in the afternoon. My\nfather had often said to me that if I was not with him when he died he would\ntry and come to me.\nI am not subject to hallucinations, and have only once had any similar\nexperience, when, as a schoolboy, I fancied I saw the figure of a dead school-\nboy who had died in the room which I slept in with my brother ; but I attach\nno importance to this.\nVictor Duleep Singh.\nLord Carnarvon writes :\n\u2014\nI can confirm Prince V. Duleep Singh's account. I heard the incident\nfrom him on the Sunday morning. The same evening, at about 12 p.m., he\nreceived a telegram notifying him of his father's sudden illness and death.\nWe had no knowledge of his father's illness. He has never told me of any\nsimilar previous occurrence.\nCarnarvon.\nWe have ascertained that the Maharajah Duleep Singh died on\nSunday, October 22nd, 1893.\nL. 978. Ad Pe Vision.\nReceived through Miss E. Sturge, of Chilliswood, Tyndall's Park,,\nBristol. The percipient, whom we will call Miss G., gave her real\nname in confidence. She writes :\n\u2014\n\fDec, 1894.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 369\nAjml 1st, 1891.\nI saw my brother, who was ill at the time, lying in his berth, dressed in\nhis clothes. The ship was moving slowly along\u2014it was a bright moonlight\nnight and everything was exceedingly quiet and peaceful. At first he appeared\nasleep, but at length opened his eyes, gave me a bright smile and one long\nlook and then closed them again. Apparently I saw him just a few hours\nbefore he died. As far as I can remember, it was after midnight on the 29th\nof December, 1886. I was in bed, and very tired, after the exertions of a\nchildren's Christmas party. Of course I was anxious about my brother, but\nfrom that time all anxiety seemed to cease. When anyone congratulated\nme upon the safe arrival of the vessel, it seemed to make no cheerful impres-\nsion, and I ceased from that time writing the weekly letters which I had\nbeen in the habit of sending, although we did not hear of his death until\nFebruary 7th, 1887. I was 22 years old at the time. I had not seen my\nbrother since the 22nd of September, 1886, the date when the vessel left\nthe docks.\nMiss Sturge adds :\n\u2014\nMiss G.'s brother had not been in good health, and had travelled a good\ndeal on account of it, but the family were not especially anxious about him\nat the time of his death. He was going alone to Australia and died very\nshortly before arrival, and it was almost by accident that the family heard\nof his death.\nMiss Sturo-e writes later :\n\u2014\n\u00b0 Juhj 2nh, 1891.\nI find from a letter I have received from [Miss G.] that she does not\nquite know whether she was asleep or awake at the time of her vision, but\nsays she is certain she was awake immediately after. She sends me the\nprinted invitation to the children's party on the 28th December, 1886, and\nshe sends also a copy of the letter from the wife of the captain of the ship\non which her brother was at the time of his death, by which I see that he\ndied at 10 p.m. on the 29th December, the dream or vision thus preceding\nthe death. Miss G. repeats that she was so certain that her brother was\ndead that she refused to write to him or send him anything. She made no\nwritten memorandum at the time, but spoke of it to Mr. and Mrs. M. with\nwhom she was then and is now living [as their governess].\nShe seems to have been in the habit of dreaming of her brother, as she\nwas very fond of him.\nMr. Myers called on Miss G., on December 18th, 1891, and\nwrites :\n\u2014\nI saw Miss G. yesterday. She thinks that her experience ought to be\nclassed as a dream, although it was more vivid than any other dream she\nremembers, and woke her up so thoroughly that she got up and did not\nsleep again for some hours.\nThis dream alone of all that she has had showed her brother ill and\naltered, as he in fact was altered before death.\nShe did not tell Mr. and Mrs. M. until the news had arrived. She\n\f370 Journal of Society for Psychical Research- [Dec, 1894.\nintentionally kept the invitation card (which I saw), as a naemento of\nthe date, not wishing to put on paper what she regarded as so private a\nmatter.\nThe best proof of the importance of this dream in her eyes is that she\nnever once wrote to her brother again, although she was devotedly attached to\nhim, and used to write by every, or almost every, mail. Had he been alive,\nhe would have missed her letters with surprise and pain. I have seen the\ncaptain's wife's letter. The brother died at Port Adelaide between 7 and\n10 p.m. on the 29th, which would be in England from 9.40 to 12.40 a.m.\non the 29th. The vision therefore preceded the death by less than\n12 hours.\nThe brother had in fact been mainly lying dressed in his berth towards\nthe last, not being strong enough to be much on deck.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nMiss G. writes to Mr. Myers on December 23rd, 1891 :\n\u2014\nDeae Sir, \u2014Enclosed with this you will find the written statement of\nMr. M. , which you desired me to send you. 1 fear you will not find it very\nsatisfactory\u2014as, of course, to be really valuable to you, I ought to have\nmentioned my dream before the news of my brother's death reached\nEngland. As it is, it was quite by accident that Mr. M. found out about it.\nWe were on the station, and he was seeing me off on my way home, and was\nexpressing sympathy with me and saying how sorry he was, etc., when I\nremarked \" it was stupid of me to feel it so much, as I'd known for a long\ntime how it would be.\" Then he pressed me to tell him how I knew, and\nI told him the facts with which you are already acquainted, and he told\nMrs. M. Before giving my account to Miss Sturge, I got both Mr. and\nMrs. M. to read it through, not liking to trust entirely to my own memory,\nand they both thought it correct.\nMr. M. corroborates as follows : \u2014\nDecember 21st, 1891.\nWith reference to the particulars which have been given by Miss G.\nrespecting the dream she had on the night of her brother's departure from\nthis life, I perfectly recollect her telling me when the news arrived that she\nhad known for a long time that he had gone. She then described minutely\nto me the surroundings of the room, &c., on the ship where he died, and\nnamed other particulars which the written accounts I subsequently read\nfrom the wife of the captain of the vessel markedly confirmed.\nI should perhaps say Miss G. is, and always has been, very averse to\nconversing on the subject, and I have always abstained from pressing her to\ndo so, and from troubling her by anything like cross questionss on the\nsubject. Miss G. was deeply attached to her brother, and had seen him off\non his leaving England.\nG. 246.\nFrom a gentleman who does not wish his name to appear.

Again I was bailed, and returned to my bed\u2014not alas ! to\nsleep, but to listen intently. In a few minutes the rustling was repeated and\nI heard\u2014as it seemed to me niosfc distinctly \u2014in a slow whisper the words\n\" Have you found the key ? \" This question, however, received no answer ;\nnor did any other sound make itself heard, though my strained faculties kept\nme awake until day dawned, and weariness once more overpowered me.\nIn the morning as I dressed I noticed that in the side of an old carved ward-\nrobe was a lofty door opening into what would be a narrow compartment,\nlocked but ivitli no key in it, and which I had no doubt unconsciously noted\nwhen undressing the night before.\nNaturally I said nothing of my adventure to my host at breakfast, and a\nbright and active day on the moors had almost banished it from my memory,\nwhen it was recalled in a most startling way. We were dining on that day\nwith another sporting tenant in the neighbourhood, with whom, as it chanced,\nI had some acquaintance. Judge of myastonishment when, as I was talking with\nour host, before dinner was announced, I heard our hostess say to my friend :\n\" Well, Edward, have you yet seen or rather heard,the Ghost of Castle 1 ''\nI noticed that my friend's reply was given in a low voice, so that I could not\ncatch its purport, and I of course made no sign. We walked homewards,\nand as we crossed the little bridge, I could not but think the old turretted\nhouse a fit scene for a ghost story. I wondered whether the night would\nbring me fresh revelations ;\nnothing more happened, however, and in a few\ndays I returned southwards, taking care not to leave any unwelcome mystery\nfor my friend's wife and daughters to brood over.\nIn the later autumn my friend came to stay with me. I did not delay to\nask him if he had taken Castle for the following season, as I knew had\nbeen his intention. \"No,\" he answered, \"through a stupid misunderstanding\non the part of the agent, it has been let over my head.\" I then\ntold him my story. He listened with breathless attention ; and when I had\nended, he told me that the house had in fact the reputation of being\n\"haunted \"\n; that he had learnt this for the first time as he travelled down\non the coach to take possession ; that the ghost was one to be heard but not\nseen ; and that to his horror he had discovered on the morning of my arrival\nthat the housekeeper, innocent of all knowledge of the story, had prepared\nfor my use the very room which was alleged to be the \" haunted chamber.''\nHe added that it was then too late to make any change, especially as he\ncould give no tolerable reason for doing so ; but that he had thought it worth\nwhile to let me know in which room I should find him in case my night's rest\nshould be disturbed.\nI have now told my story of \" the ghost of Castle\"; but I must in\nall honesty give you my reasons for treating it as a case of pure though\nvery remarkable \" coincidence \"\u2014so far, that is, as the contribution of my\nexperience may seem to any lover of the marvellous to add weight to the\ntradition of the neighbourhood\u2014no particulars of which, however, have ever\nreached me.\n\fDec, 1894.] Joumctl of Society for Psychical Research. 373\n1. I was still under the influence of Bulwer's weird story, The House and\nthe Brain.\n2. I was in a state of exhaustion after a long and fatiguing journey.\n3. The admonition of my host, twice repeated, to note the door of his\nroom.\n4. An unconscious notice that, while the other doors of the wardrobe had\nbeen left open for my use, the one door was locked and had no hey in it.\n5. Then comes in what I call the remarkable coincidence\u2014the accident,\nnamely, that the housekeeper had assigned to me the very room which\ntradition declared to be haunted ; but this of course adds nothing to the\nevidence for the supernatural.\nI am confident that people do not attach enough importance to the part\nthat simple coincidence plays in these stories, and especially in what are\ncalled prophetic dreams. The reason is obvious\u2014that 99 coincidences out\nof every 100 are so utterly insignificant that one has no temptation to dwell\non them.\nI ought to add, perhaps, that I had no second visitation in the haunted\nroom ; nor did I hear (as I doubtless should have heard) that any other\noccupant of the room during my friend's tenancy was troubled by any\nuncanny sight or sound.\nThe writer adds later :\n\u2014\nJidy m.h, 1894.\nMy recollection is quite clear that the impression I spoke of as to the\nunusual emphasis of my host's admonition about the door of his room did\nnot arise save by way of after-thought ; did not in fact give me at the time\nany suggestion whatever that \"it meant something.\"\nThe name of the house was given us in confidence.\nWith regard to the next case, when the impression\u2014familiar\nto many persons\u2014that certain circumstances are a repetition of what\nhas previously happened, only occurs during or after the experience, it\nmay obviously be explained as a mere illusion of memory. But to\nthe main incident here given this explanation does not apply, since the\nimpression not only occurred, but was mentioned, before its apparent\nwerification.\nM CI. 91. Impression.\nFrom Miss L. M. Robinson, 24, Trent-road, Brixton Hill.\nAs a child, when taken to a strange place, I often had the feeling that I\n3iad been there before. Sometimes it would come on entering a house for\nthe first time. Sometimes during the holidays when we used to visit many\nstrange places, a tree, a church, a turn of the country road, would haunt me\nwith a strange sense of familiarity.\nThe first day I went to school we turned into\n.an inn yard which the nurse explained was a short cut to the school.\nAt once the feeling rushed upon me that I had been there before ;\nevery\n\f374 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. \\v>m., 1894.\nobject was familiar. A curious glass window in the pavement over which I\nwas walking, I felt I had passed over many times. I thought about this all\nthe morning and speculated how I could possibly have seen the place before.\nWhen my school days were over my mother took me abroad. We\ntravelled about for some months and then settled down for the autumn at\nGunten on the Lake of Thoune. Shortly after our arrival I sprained my\nankle, so I could not join many of the excursions.\nOne lovely warm day I had watched the merry party start for Thoune. I\nfelt rather comforted that my mother had decided to remain with me. We\nhad just settled down to our books, when one of the party returned to beg\nmy mother to allow him to take us on the Lake, as we could have a row\nwithout fatigue and he said he would show us a lovely view, which we could\nsee after a very short climb. So we went, and had a most enjoyable two\nhours on the Lake before we reached a little point of the shore, where we\nlanded.\nWe commenced climbing a narrow winding path when suddenly I was\nseized with the conviction that I had been there before. So strong was this\nfeeling that I told my mother, and to convince her I was not mistaken,\nsaid, after we should turn a corner just before the top there was a tree on\nthe left with a tin notice. When we had nearly reached the top and had\nturned a corner we saw the tree to our left with its tin notice. It was\nimpossible from any point to have caught sight of it before, and this was\nthe first time in my life I had been near the spot, and until that clay I had\nnot been so far up the lake towards Interlaken. Yet every tree was\nfamiliar, and every point in the landscape I knew well. T will copy a piece\ntaken from my rough notes written at the time :\n\u2014\n\" October Idth, 1887.\n\" Every one went to Thoune, but mother, thinking I might be lonely,\nreturned, and Mr. T \u2014 took us on the lake where we landed and saw\nthe most lovely view we had ever seen. Half way up I said, '\nI have been here\nbefore and near the top you will see a tree with a funny tin notice. ' It was\nso. I had never seen or heard of the place before.\"\nLouise M.

In a book I have\n\fDec, 1S94.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 375\nlately come across. Was wird aus ims nacli dem Tode, by Hans Arnold, (Max\nSpohr, Leipzig,) the following assertion is made :\u2014\n\" At Quadewater, a little town near Utrecht, there existed still at the\nbeginning of the 18th century a pair of witch-scales, privileged by Charles Y.\nAt\u00b0the time of the witch persecutions, somnambulists . . . were taken\nfor witches just because they had lost their gravity. Those who were\naccused of witchcraft were therefore weighed in the witch-scales, and from\nthe records we find that the judge had a right to acquit a person of witch-\ncraft who weighed over 30 pfund.\"\nHave people in abnormal conditions ever been weighed in modern\ninvestigations, and if not, would it not be a good thing to do so, and to see-\nif any change of weight were produced ?\nAn Associate.\nCATALOGUE OF UNPRINTED CASES.\n{Continued from the February Journal.)\nFivrther information improving the evidence in any of these eases\nwill be gratefully received.\nB L 176 Dream \u2014Miss Ive dreams that her little niece falls into the\nwater while out with her in a boat, and cannot be found Her niece did\nfall into the water, either the day before or the day after while feeding\nsome ducks, but was at once pulled out.
