He was educated at home by his father, a clergyman, and later at Bath College (1878-1881). He moved to Weston-super-Mare, becoming friends with spiritualists and John Allen Bartlett, also a clergyman\u2019s son, who later acted as the mediumistic source for his psychic activities at Glastonbury.1\n\nFrom 1888 he worked as an architect in Bristol. His two-volume work Roodscreens and Roodlofts, written jointly with Rev Dom Bede Camm, brought him a reputation as an expert in church architecture.2\n\nBond was a member of the Freemasons, the Theosophical Society, the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and the Ghost Club. He joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1902 and the Somerset Archeological and Natural History Society the following year.  Glastonbury Excavations\n\nIn 1907 Bond joined excavations in monastic buildings taking place at Glastonbury, where he was appointed unpaid director by the diocese of Bath and Wells. This work uncovered the dimensions and purpose of a number of the monastic buildings, notably the Edgar and Loretto Chapels.\n\nBond claimed that the breakthroughs were brought about by the mediumship of his friend John Bartlett making contact with dead monks from the time of the early history of the abbey.3 He published his results in a book The Gate of Remembrance.4 This lead to his dismissal in 1921 by the dean of Bath and Wells, Dr Joseph Armitage Robinson, who was opposed to mediumship being used in archeology.\n\nCritical archeologists disputed Bond\u2019s claims, pointing out that some documentation already existed regarding the whereabouts of the buildings and objecting to a lack of scientific controls.5\n\nAs editor of&nbsp; Psychic Science, the quarterly journal of the College of Psychic Science, between 1921 and 1926 Bond published several pamphlets about his continued mediumistic contacts with deceased Glastonbury monks.6\n\nFor a full description of this episode, see The Glastonbury Scripts.  Other Research\n\nBond collaborated with the medium Geraldine Cummins on automatic writings that came to be known as the Scripts of Cleophas, purporting to be accounts by Christians who lived in the first century after Christ\u2019s death. This later led to a copyright dispute, with Bond claiming that the scripts were addressed to him and that he should therefore have full rights. The claim went to court but was dismissed.7 &nbsp;\n\nAnother medium, Hester Dowden, provided him with the spirit communication which led to his writing The Gospel of Philip the Deacon.8\n\nBond\u2019s research on the possibility of thought-forms in psychic photography, carried out with Ada Deane,9 was acknowledged in the book Thought-forms by Annie Besant and CW Leadbeater.10  American Society for Psychical Research\n\nIn 1926 Bond emigrated to New York, where he was appointed education secretary to the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) and editor of its journal. He became involved in the dispute over the mediumship of Mina Crandon (\u2018Margery\u2019), and having been a strong supporter became sceptical of its validity, following which he was dismissed.11\n\nAt this time, he became a member of the Catholic Church of North America (the Old Roman Catholic Church), founded in 1925, being ordained in 1932 and being \u2018swiftly elevated to a status equivalent to (the only) bishop\u2026\u2019.12\n\nIn 1936, Bond returned to England and after living in London for a while moved to Wales, where he died in 1945.
