To them was entrusted the\nspecialcharge of religion; and, as priests, they\nwere superior in education and training to the\npeoplein general. Among the Persians, \"the\nlovers of wisdom and the servants of God\"\nwere, according to Suidas, called magi. It\nseems also, that they extended themselves into\nother lands, and that among the Chaldeans\nthey were an organized body.\n' We read in the inspired book of Daniel,~\n\"the magi,\" or \"wise men,\" among whom t\nprophet himself was classed; and others, w\nknow, directed by \" the star in the ('ast,\" went\nto the infant Saviour, when born, at Bethlehem,\n\" as Christ the Lord,\" and presented to him\ntheir offerings, \"gold, and frankincense, and\nmyrrh.\" Among the Greeks and Romans, the\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n6 .MAGIC.\nsame c~assof persons was styled Chaldeans and\n.\nmagi.\nFor a time, the magi surpassed the .rest of \u00b7\nthe world in knowledge, and were the friends,\ncompanions, and counsellors, of its mightiest\nsovereigns. But their $cie!lce, from having\nno solid basis, sank, after a while, into in-\nsignificance. On the _\nruins of its reputation\n\u00b7other persons sought to build theirs. A man\nwho.knew, or could perform some things, with\n,which others h~d no acquajnt;a.nce,or for which\n\u00b7they had no power, announced himself as a\nmagician. Npr w~r~\nth~ peop1t='\nindisposed to\nconcede to him the credit he desired, espe-\ncially .if he claimed alliance with spiritual\nbeings'; and, in not a few instances, they a~\ntributed his n1arvels to suoh agenoy. Thus,\n\u00b7then, the magician may be tl'aOedt9 the magua,\nor IIJ.agian; and ~agio, to the so\"oall~ philo-\nsophy of the east. \u00b7\nMagic squares are of great antiquity. A\nsquare of this kind is divided into several other\nsmall equal squares, or cells,filled u~ with the\nterms of any progression of numbers, but\ngenerally an arithmetical one; so that those\n\u00b7 each band, whet~er hoi-izontal, vertical, or\niagonal, shall always make the\u00b7 s~e sum.\nThe ancients ascribed to them gr.eat virtues;\n\u00b7 and the disposition of numl>era formed the\nbasis and principle ~f many of their talismans.\nAccording Iy, a square of \u00b7one cell, filled up\nwith unity, ,vas the symbol of the Deity, on\naccount of the unity and imrqutability of God;\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f7\nfor they remarked that this\u00b7 square\u00b7 was, by its\nnature, unique and immutable; the product of\nunitr by itself being always unity. The\nsquare of the root two, was the symbol of im-\nperfeot matter, both on account of the four\nelements, and of its being supposed impossible t,o\narrange this square magically. A square of nine\noellawas assigned or consecrated to Saturn; that\nof sixteen t,oJupiter; that oftwenty-fiveto Mars;\nthat of thirty-six t.o the sun; that of forty-~ine\nto Venus; that of 1ixty-four to Mercury; and\ntllat of eighty-one, or nine on each side, to the\nmoon. Those whp can find any relation be-\ntween two planets, and such an arrangement of\nnumbers, must have minds strongly tinctured\nwith.superstition; yet so it was in the mysterious\n,_ phil08ophy of lamblichus, Porphyry, and their\ndi1eiples.\nPlana,, as well as numbers, were long con-\nsidered. to be endowed with magical properties.\nPliny enumerates those which, according t,o\nPythagoras, were supposed to have the power\nof concealing waters. To others were attri-\nbut,ed extraordinary effects. The asyritea,as\nit was denomihated by the Egyptians, was\nusecl under the idea that it acted as a\nfence against witchcraft ; and the nepentk\nwhich Helen presented, in a potion, to Me~e..\u00b7 .\u00b7\nlaus, was believed, by the same people, to be\npowerful in banishing sadness, and in restoring\nthe mind to its accustomed, or even to greater\ne11eerfulness. Whatever may be th~ virtues of\nIUCh\nJterbs; they were used rather from an\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n8\nidea of their magical than of their medicinal\nqualities; every cure was cunningly ascribed\nto some mysterious and occult power.\nFrom the same superstition, metals and\nstones were supposed to be endowed with sin-\ngular virtues: the opal, to grow pale at the\ntouch of poison; the emerald, to remove intoxi-\ncation; and the carbuncle, \" only to be found\nin the head of the dragon, the hideous inhabit-\nant of the island of Ceylon,\" to shine in the\ndarkness. As the metal called gold always\nbore the highest value, it was concluded, from\nan absurd analogy, that its power to preserve\nhealth and cure disease must likewise surpass\nthat of all other applications. Multitudes gave\nthemselves to busy idleness in atteplpting to\nrender it potable, and to prevent it from again\nbeing converted into metal. Not only did they\nlabour in obscure situations, but in the splendid\nlaboratories of nobles\u00b7 and. sovereigns. ?.fen\nof rank, impelled by one common frenzy,\nforn1ed secret alliances; and even proceeded to\nsuch extravagance as to bring ruinous debts on\nthemselves and their posterity. The object of\nwhich they were in pursuit was \" an elixir of\n\"\nn Italy, Germany, France, and other\ncountries, the common people often denied\nthemselves the necessaries of life, to save as\nmuch as would purchase a few drops of the\ntincture of gold, which was superstitiously or\nfraudulently offered for sale. So fully did they\neonfidein the efficacy\nof this imaginarypower,\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz f\n)IAQIC POWER OF MINERALS.\nLLat on it generally depended their only ho\nof recovery.

O\u00b7\ntimes are in the hands of God; and at his w\nthe -dust returns to the dust \u00b7from whence\nwas taken, and the spirit to him who gave it.\nHow fearful was the ignorance that prevailc\nin the bygone times to which a reference 11:\nbeen made! -What gratitude should we feel fi\nthe advantages we enjoy! Let us, then, co1\nstantly remember that _asto ua ~uch has beE\ngiven, so of us much will be required; and th~\none kind of knowledge surpasses all othen\n\"This\" said the adorable Redeemer, \"is li1\neternai that they might kno,v thee the onl\ntrne God,\nand Je~P ..\n\"18 C1'rh-t:whom thou hm\nsent.\" John xvii. 8.\ng\nOf1Qlr01 'rom\nINDIANA. UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nCHAPTER II.\nPeats of modern magician&:-Their wonden ~lained-The\nsnake-charmersof India-A Chinese delusion-The magi-\ncian of Cairo.\nWONDER-WORKERS have often appeared. Some\nof them \u00b7have lately repeated their most re-\nmarkable feats in London and various places in\nEngland, varied by others of inferior interest.\nLarge and astonished assemblies have witnessed\ntheir performance, and public journals have\ndescribed them as absolut;ely \"inexplicable.\"\nAnd yet, though the writer has no personal\nacquaintance with any modern \" magician,\" he\nhas no doubt that all their feats may be ac-\ncounted for, from sleight-of-hand, confederacy,\ningenious contrivance, or the application ot\nsome natural law. A few illustrations shall\nnow be given.\nMany delusions are entirely dependent on\nsleight-of-hand; a rapidity of manipulation\nbeing attained by long practice, as in the mar-\nvellous movements of the fingers of a highly\naccomplished instrumenta! performer; while the\npower may become so great as to defy the\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nILLUSIONS EXPLAINED~\nobservation of the acutest vision. The late\nMr. Walker, minister at Demattar, in the\nMears, told sir Walter Scott of a young\ncountry girl, wlio threw turf, 1tone1, and other\nmisailes, with such dexteritl, that it was, for a\ntime, impossible to ascertain the agency em-\nployed in the dia~rbanoea of which ahe was\nthe aole cause.\nA friend of the writer has a remarkable nicety\nof touch, and, at pleasure, a rapid movement of\nthe hands, by which he can rival many magical\nfeats. Thus he conveys balls under cups, and\nappears to change them into fruit, to the\nastonishment of lookers-on. He also takea two\nhorn cups of exactly the same size, and pro-\n- duces the impression that he cauaea one to fall\nthrough the other, when this is impossible, and\nall that is done is effected by dexterous and\nrapid manipulation, illustrating the proverb,\n\"The hand is quicker than the eye.\"\nMany astounding feats, which form a part of\nall popular magical exhibitions, are performed\n\\ by this l~::!1-~~n. Apparently, the per-\n) former receiv~ a lady's wedding.ring and\nbreaks it in piecea; burns a :five-pound note\nhanded to him by a spectator ; reduces a hat\nto a hideous shape; or crushes a bonnet into\nfragments, and then restorea them uninjured ro\nthe respective parties, amidst the acclamations\nof ~e multitude. But all that is done is with\nindescribable rapidity to substitute articles of\nhis own to undergo the process of destruc-\ntion, and, at the right moment, to exhibit thos,\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f12 MAGIC.\nwhich have been presented by the spectators,\nand are preserved in safety.\nAnother cause of wonderment is confederacy.\nA modem performer has been accustomed to\nhand a box to one of his audience, requesting\nthat in it might be placed any article that he\nhad, and,that it might be passed on from one\nto another for the same purpose. While this\nhas been done, he has proceeded to his table,\nand apparently waited the filling of the box.\nAt length, while the box has been held up at a\n.distance, he has\u00b7 placed his rod to his eye and\ndescribed the collection that has been made.\nHe has said, perhaps, \" I can see in that box a\n.piece of ribbon, a lozenge, a few grains, ,part, I\ndare say, of a pinch of snuff, and a lady's card;\nI will try and read it~Miss - Clara - Hen-\nderson;\" t.LdBD .hepasc;esthrough the chief part\nof the series. And yet, as his patrons look on\nwith astonishment, they do not think of what\nis most likely to be the fact, that a confederate,\nsitting as one of the audience, made a list of\nthe articles as they were deposited in the box,\nand despatched it in portions or altogether, so\nthat their names might reach the eye of the\nperformer from some part Qfhis table.\nA third means of wonder-working is that of\ningeniouscontrivance. We will illustrate this\nby two popular feats. A number of handker-\nchiefs. taken from the audience by more than\none popular performer, were placed in a emall\nwashing-tub, into which water was poured, and\nthey were washed for a few minutes. They\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fILLUSIONSEXPLAINED. 13\nwere then placed in a vessel like the figure,\nbelow, and immediately\nafterwards the performer\nsaid to the persons in\nfront : \" I will give you\nthese;\" and taking off\nthe top, when he was\nexpected to throw out\nthe wet handkerchiefs,\nall that fell was a num-\nber of flowers. He now\nbrought out abox, which\nhe opened, and showed\nit to be empty ; then\nshutting it, and uttering\na few cabalistic words,\nhe opened it again, and\nthere were the handker-\nchiefs, all dry, folded,\nand scented, which he\ndistributed to their re-\nspective claimants.\nAnother experiment of a popular perforn1er\n.was called \"coffee for the million.\" Producing\na vessel like the diagram A ;\nthe performer filled it with un-\nground coffee, and placing it\nunder a cover n, he said,\" There,\nwhen you have done that, let it\nsimmer for three-quarters-of-an\nhour ; but, perhaps, you will\nnot like to wait so long ; here A\nDigitizedby Go gle 0!1glM 'mm\nINDIA~ UNIVERSfTY\n\f11 MAGIC.\nthen it is;\" and on removing\nthe cover, the vessel appeared\nfull of hot \u00b7liquid coffee. In\nanother vessel of the same\nkind he obtained lump-sugar\n~ from rape-seed; and in a third,\n~ warm mil~ from horse-beans;\n, and pouring out the cqff~e\n-=- into cups, sent them round to\nregale l}is auditory; amidst\n:a their loud and approving\nshouts at so gNUtta transformation.\nAs these feats are the \u2022result of considerable\ningenuity, it le probable that the devices em--\nplayed would not readily occur to spectators in\ngeneral, while they would utterly escape those\nwhose object is merely amusement, and w~o,.if\nthey thought at all, would be likely to describe\nthe result as supernatural. We proceed, ~hen1\nto the unravellh1g of the mystery. Let 1t be\nobserved, in reference to the first experiment,\nthat .a number of handkerchiefs are collected in\n\u2022\u00b7the early part of the evening for various illu-\nsions, and that many of them appear for a time\non the performer's table. Provided with a\ncollection of these articles~ from the handsome\nsilk handkerchief to one trimmed with lace,\nused by a fashionable lady, he could easily\nsubstitute his own of the same kind for those of\nhis n.uditory, as the curtain falls, according to\nthe arrangements of the evening, between the\ncollection of the hand.kerchiefs and. the subse-\nquent process.

W. Arthur, in his work on the\n~ysore, directs us to results of a different kind:\n-\" Whilst walki~g in the verandah,\" he says,\n\" some snake-charmers approached, and forth-\nwith began to show us their skill. They pro-\nduced several bags and basket,9, containing\nserpents of the most poisonous kind-the cobra\ndi capello; then blew upon an instrument\nshaped like a cocoa-nut, with a short tube\ninserted, and producing music closely allied to\nthat of the bag-pipe. The animals were brought\nforth, raised themselves to the music, spread\nout their head, showing tha spectacle mask\nfully distended; and waved about with consi-\nderable grace, and liUle appearance of venom.\nThe men coquetted '#lth them, and coiled them\nabout their persons, without anysign of either\ndislike or fear. . This powerDi dealing with\ncreatures so deadly ia ascribed by the natives\nto magic. Europeat11 generall7 aooount for it\nby saying that the fang, are extttieted. But\nthe most reasonable explanation \u2022emnsto be,\nthat when the 1nak1 is fint caught, by a\ndexterous movem@ttit)fthe charmer, the hand\nis slipped along the body,until it reaches the\nneck, which he presses so firmly, as to compel\nan ejection of the virus; thus destroying, for a\ntime, all power to harm; and tl1at this opera-\ntion is repeated as often as is necessary, to\nprevent the dangerous accumulation. If this\nbe true-and I believe it is-nothing ia n~\nOr1QI\nr01 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fSERPENT CHARMING. 19\nmryto the safe haildling of these reptiles, buc\na knowledge of the laws which regulate the\nvenomous secretion. The wonder seems to lie\nin the power they possess of attrac,ting the\nmakea by their rude music, abd\"'seiz~ them\nin the first instance. But enough is known to\n111ake\nit evident that, in what all natives and\nmany Europeans regard as mysterio\\18 and\nmagical, there ii nothin~ but experience, tact,\nand courage.\"\nA strange and repulsive feat is thus described\nby the. Rev. G. Smith, in his recent work on\n\" China\"\" \" Aquei conducted us into a. room,\nwhere be was sitting with his two wives, hand-.\nsomelyattired, looking from a window on the\ncro-wd assembled in the street to witne88 the\nperformances of. a native .juggler. The latter,\nafter haranguing the crowd with much anima-\ntion in the Nanking dialect, (aa is usual with\nactors,) proceeded to one part of the crowd,\nand took thence a child, apparently five or six\nyearsold, who, with struggling reaistance, was\nled into the oentre of the circle. The man\nthen\u2022 with impassioned gesture, violently threw\nthe child on a wooden stool, and, placing him\non his back, flourished over him a large knife;\nthe child all the time sobbing and crying as if\nfrom fright. Two or three older men from the\ncrowd approached, with earnest remonstrancea\nagainst the threatened deed of violence. For a\ntim~, he desisted, but, soon after, returning to\nthe child, who was still uttering most pitiable\ncries, he place~ him with his .back upwards,\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nand, notwithstanding the violent prote.stsof the\nseniors, he suddenly dashed the knife into the\nback of the child's neck, which it appeared to\nenter till it had almost divided it from \u00b7the\nhead; the blood meanwhile flowing copiously\nfrom the wound, and streaming to the ground,\nand over the hands of the man. The struggle\nof the child grew more and more feeble, and at\nlast altogether ceased. The man then arose,\nleaving the knife firmly fixed in the child's\nneck. Copper cashwas then thrown liberally\ninto the ring, for the benefit of the principal\nactors. These were collected by assistants, all\nof them viewing the influx of the coins with\ngreat deligQt, and bowing continually to\u00b7 the\nspectators, and reit,erating the words, ' To\nseoz,' 'Many thanks.' After a time, the man\nproceeded towards the corpse, pronounced a\ntew words, took away the \u00b7knife, and called\naloud to the child. Soon there appeared the\nsigns of returning animation. The stiffness of\ndeath gradually relaxed, and at last he stood\nup among the eager crowd, who closed around\n\u2022 him, and bountifully rewarded him with cash.\nThe performance was evidently one which ex-\ncited delight in the bystanders, who, by their\ncontinued shouts, showed their approbation of\nthe acting.\"\nIt is almost superfluous to add, that the\ndeception consisted in the construct.ion of the\nblade and the handle of the knife, so that, by\nmaking a sawing motion on the throat of the\nchild, a stream of coloured liquid, resembling\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fABD-EL-KADER. 21\nblood, is pun1ped out ; a little acting on the\npart of the performer and the child is amply\nsufficient for all the rest.\nWithin the last few years, we have had ac-\ncounts of a magician in Egypt, first described\nin a valuable work on that country by ?tlr.\nLane, which produced an extraordinary im-\npression. The ma-\ngician, it was said,\ncaused a boy to see \/.. \u00b7'4 Y _, \" t_ ~\"' ..,\ncertain persons called ,, ~-\nfor, in a little ink,\nplace<l in his hand, in x\nI\nthe centre of a double\nmagic square, some-\nwhat like the figure.\nOne of the most pro-\nfound writers of the\n~ r\n) --------\u00b7<\nv.

But can this assumption be\nmadeon any other ground than a prior general\nassumption that there is no such preternatural\nintervention in the system of the world? But\nhow to lcnou, that there is not? The negative\ndecision pronounced in confident ignorance, is\na conceited impertinence, which ought to be\nrebuked by that philosophy whose oracles it is\nOri QI\nn;il 'rem\nINDIANA UNIVERSITY\n\fDi itiz by\n.IIAtilU\u2022\naffecting to utter. For what any man knows,\nor can know, there may be such intervention.\nThat it is not incon1patible with the constitu-\ntion of the world, is an unquestionable fact\nwith the unsophisticated believers in the sacred\nrecords. And not a few occurrences in larer\nhistory have totally defied every attempt at\nexplanation in any other way.\"\u2022\nAnd yet sir Gardiner Wilkinson, who sub-\nsequently travelled in Egypt, and visited the\n. .\nmagician, says :-\n\" On going to see him, I was determined to\nexamine the matter with minute attention, at\nthe same time that I divested myself of every\nprevious bias, either for 9r against his pre-\ntendeapowers. A party having been made up to\nwitness the exhibiti<1n, we met, \u00b7according to\nprevious agreement, at Mr. Lewis's house on\nWednesday evening, the 8th of December.\nThe magician was ushered in, and having\ntaken his place, we all sat down, some before\nhim, others by his side. The party consisted\nof colonel Barnet, our consul-ge:peral, Mr.\nLewis, Dr. Abbott; Mr. ~uel, Mr.~Christian,\nM. Prisse, with another French gentleman, and\nmyself, four of whom understood Arabic very\nwell; so that we had no need of any interpreter.\nThe magician, after entering into conversation\nwith many of us on different subjects, and dis-\ncussing two or three pipes, prepared for the\nperformance. He first of all requested that a\n* Foster'\u2022 Contributions to the Eclectic Review, voL i.\np. H5.\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fMU\nb~EW of livecharcoal should be brought him,\n\u00b7and,..4l the mean while, oooupied himself in\nwriti\u00b5g 'Ppon a long slip of paper five sentenoea\nof two lines ~h, then two others, one of a\naingle\nline,and the other of two, as an invoca-\ntion to the spirits, Every sentence began with\n'Tuyurshoon.' . Each was separated from the\none above and below it. by a line, to direct him\nin tearing them apart. A boy was then called,\nwho was ordered to sit down before the magi-\ncian. He did ao,.and the magician having\nasked for some ink from Mr. Lewis, traced\nwith a pen Qn the palm of his right hand a\ndouble square, containing the nine numbers in\nthis orqer, or in English-making fifteen each\nway; the centre one being five-the evil num-\nber. This I remarked to the magician, but\nhe made no reply. A brazier was brought\nand placed between the magician and the boy,\nwho was ordered to look stedfastly into the ink,\nand report what he should see. I begged the\nmagician to etpeakslowly enough to give me\ntime to yrite down every word, which he pro-\nmised tf do, without being displeased at the\nJ!equest;- nor had be objected, during the pr~\nliminary part of the performance, to my\naUempt to sketch him as he sat. . He now\nbegan an incantation, calling on the spirits by\nthe power of' our lord Soolayman,' with the\nwords ' tuyurshoon' and ' haderoo' (be present)\nfrequently repeated.\n\" He ~hen muttered words to himself, and\ntearing \u2022p&l't the diiferent ~entences he had\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nwritten, he put them, one after another, into\nthe ~e, together with \u00b7some frankincense.

This boy\nwas then sent away, and another was brought,\nwho had never before seen the magician, having\nbeen chosen with another, by Mr. Lewis, on\npurpose ;\u00b7 but after many incantations, incense,\nand\u00b7 long delay, he could see \u00b7nothing, and fell\nasleep over the ink. The other boy was then\ncalled in, but he, like the other, could not be\nmade to see anything ; and a fourth was\nbrought in, ,vho had evidently acted his part\nbefore. Hefirst saw a shadow, \u00b7and was or-\ndered to ' tell him to sleep;' and, after the\nftags and the sultan as usual, some one sug-\ngested that lord Fitzroy So\u00b7merset should be\ncalled for. He was\ndescribed in a white Frank\ndress, a long, high, white hat, black stockings,\nand white gloves, tall, and standing before him\nwith black boots. I asked how he could see his\nstockings with boots ? The boy answered,\n'Under his trowsers.' He continued, 'IIis\neyes are white, moustaches no beard, but little\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fAnn..:EL-KADER. 25\nwhiskers, an~ yellow or light hair ; he is thin,\nthin legs, thin arms; in his left hand he holds\na stick, and in the other a pipe; he has a black\nhandkerchief round his neck, his throat but-\ntoned up, his trowsers are long, he wears green\nspectacles.' The magician, seeing some of the\nparty smiling at the description and its inac-\ncuracies, said to the boy, ' Don't tell lies, boy.'\nTo which he answered, ' I do not ; why\nshould I ?'-M. 'Tell h~ to go.'-B. 'Go.'\nQueen Victoria was next called for, who was\ndescribed as short, dressed in black trowsers,\na white hat, black shoes, whi~ gloves, red coat,\nwith lining, and black waistcoat, with whiskers,\nbut no beard nor moustaches, and holding in\nhis hand a glass tumbler. He was asked if\n~e person were a man or a woman ? He\nanswered, ' A man.' We told the magician\nthat it was our queen I He said, ' I do not\nknow why they should say what is false ; I\nknew she was a woman, but the boys describe\nas they see.'\n\"From the manner in which the questions\nwere put, it is very evident that, when a boy is\npersuaded to see anything, the appearances 01\nthe sweeper, the flags, and the sultan, are the\nresult of leading questions. The boy pretends\nor imagines he sees a man or a shadow, and he\nis t,oldto order some one to sweep : he is there-\nfore prepared with his answer ; and the same\ncontinues to the end, the magician always tell-\ning him whathe is to call for, and consequently\nwhatbe is to see.

To\nthis it must be added, that his avowed theory\nof morals was, on all occasions, that ' we did\nour whole duty if we did what we thought\nbest for our fellow-creatures and most agreeable\nto them.' Osman was present when llr. Lane\nwas so ast,onished at hearing the boy describe\nvery accurately, the person of M. Burckhardt,\nwi_th whom the magician was unacquainted,\nbut who had been Osman's .patron, and who,\nalso, knew well the other gentleman whom Mr.\nLane states in his book that the boy described\nas appearing ill and lying on a sofa, and Mr.\nLane added that he had, probably,been asked\nby Osman about that gentleman's health, whom\nMr. Lane then knew to be swfering under an\nattack of rheumatism.

We proceed now to consider some\neffects regarded as magical, which are satisfac-\ntorily explained on natural principles, beginning\nwith mechanics.\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fMAGICAL IIACJIINES. Hl\nAn ability to construct wonderfttl or magical\nmachines was manifest among the ancients.\nArchytas, a native of Tarentum, in Italy, who\nlived four hundred years before the birth ot\nour Lord and Saviour, is said to have made a\nwooden dove, which flew and sustained iteelf\nfor some time in the air. Other clever contrh'-\nanees are also mentioned. \" A magician,\" says\nD'lsraeli, \" was annoyed, as philosophers still\naret by passengers in the street; and he, parti-\ncularly so, by having horses led to drink u_ndet\nhis window. He made a magical horse of wood,\naccording to one of the book8of Hermes,\nwhich perfectly ans'\\\\r-ered his Jlurpose, by\nfrightening away the horses, or, rather, the\ngrooms I The wooden b()rse, no doubt, gave\nso~e palpable \u00b7kick.\"\nIt is worthy of remark, that tales of ancient\ntimes mU8t be received with caution. We\nfind it neee88ary, even at a much later period.\nThe tricks whioh now amuse or astonish the\npopulace at a 0011ntry fair, would be greatly\nexaggerated in a credulous age, and often\nassume even the most portentous colouring.\nNoi: is it difficult to guess, and sometimes to\ndiseover, the stages of similar and great mysti-\nfications. The following instance is rather re-\nmarkable. On Charle1 v. enooring Nuremberg,\na celebrated German astronomer, whose re:u\nname wa! Johann Millier, but who styled him-\nself Regiomontanus, exhibited some automata\nwhieh he had constructed. 'fhese were a.n\neagle of wood, which, placed on the gate of the\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\ncity, rose up and :flapped its wings, while \u00b7tha\n_emperorwas passing below; and a fly, made of\nsteel, which walked round a table. Now all\nthis is sufficiently credible. But what is the\nrecord of the chroniclers only a few years after?\nThat the wooden eagle sprang from the t9wer\nand soared in the air; and that the steel fly\nflew three times round the emperor, and then\nalighted buzzing on his hand I\nIn many instances, the mechanism of modem\ntimes is surprisingly minute. A watchmaker\nin London presented his majesty George m.\nwith a repeating watch he had constructed, set\nin a ring. Its size was something less than a\nsilver two-pence; it contained onehundred-and-\ntwenty-five different parts, and weighed, alto-\ngether, no more than five pennyweights and\nseven grains I\nIn an exhibition of Maillardet, which the\nwriter has seen, the lid of a box suddenly flew\nopen, and a small bird of beautiful plumage\nstarted forth from its nest. The wings fluttered,\nand the bill opening with the tremulous motion\npeculiar to singing birds, it began to warble.\nAfter a succession of notes, whose sound well\nfilled a large apartment, it retired to its nest,\nand the lid closed. Its performances occupied\nabout four minutes. In the same exhibition\nwere an automatic spider, a caterpillar, a mouse,\nand a serpent; all of ,vhich exhibited the pecu-\nliar movements of the living creatures. The\nspider was made of steel: it ran on the suri:'lce\nof a table for three minutes, and its course\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fIDNUTE ENGntES. 33\ntended towards the middle of the table. The\nserpent crawled about in every direction,\nopened its mouth, hissed, and darted forth ita\ntongue.\nSeveral years ago, a watchmaker, residing\nin a town in which the writer lived, made a\nworking model of a steam-engine, the packing-\ncaae of which was a walnut-shell. On showing\nit one day to a gentleman, the machine was\nsuddenly stopped, the mechanic remarking,\n\"There is something wrong in one of the safety-\nvalves.\" \" Safety-valve I\" exclaimed the ob-\nserver; \" I have not yet been able to detect the\n:By-wheel!\" .\nThe most curious specimen of minute work-\nmanship, however, with which we are ac-\nquainted, is a high-pressure engine, the work\nof a watchmaker having a stand at the\nPolytechnic Institution, and first exhibited in\n184:o. Each part was made according to scale,\nit worked by atmospheric pressure, in lieu of\nsteam, with the greatest activity, yet it was so\nsmaU,that it stood on a fourpenny-piece, with\nground to spare, and, with the exception of the\n1ly-wheel, it might be covered with a thimble.\nD'Alembert describes a flute-nh1yer, con-\nstrucfiedby Vaucanson, which he saw-~xhibited\nat Paris in 1738. The writer has also seen\npne, in which a figure appeared seated, and then\nrose and played a tune, the motions of the\nfingers seeming to accord with the notes. - He\ncannot answer for the music having been pro-\nduce<!by the movements of the hands of the\n\u2022\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n34 MECHANICS.\nautomaton. D'Alemhert affirms, however, that\nthe automaton of Vaucanson really projected\nthe air with its lips against the embouchure of\nthe instrun1ent, producing the different octaves\nby expanding and contr~cting their openings,\ngiving rnore or less air, and regulating the\n\u00b7tones by its fingers, in the \u00b7manner of living '\nperformers. The height of the figure, with the\npedestal, containing some of the machinery, was\nnearly six feet; it commanded three octaves,\nseveral notes of which musicians find it difficult\nto produce. Some years ago, two automaton\n:flute-players were exhibited in this country, of\nthe size of life, which performed ten or twelve I\nduets. That they actually played the flute\nmight be proved, by placing t.he finger on any\nhole t~at was unstopped for a moment by the\nautomata.\nM. Vaucanson produced a flageolet-player,\nwho beat a tambourine with one hand. Th(,\nflageolet had only three holes, and some notes\nwere made by half-stopping these. The lowest\nnote was produced by a force of wind equal to\nan ounce, the highest by one of fifty-six French\npounds. A duck was, however, considered to .\nbe his chef-d'reuvre; it dabbled in the mire,\nswam, drank, quacked, raised and moved its\nwings, and dressed its feathers with its bill; it\neven extended its neck, took barley from the\nhand and swallowed it, during which process\nthe muscles \u00b7of the neck were seen in\u00b7 motion,\nand it \u00b7also digested the food by means of\nmaterials provided for its solution in the\nOr1QI\nrid!

The invent.or made no secret oft.he\nmachinery, which excited, at the time, great\nadmiration.\nMaelzel, the inventor of the metronome, or\ntime-measurer, frequently used to aid pupila\nin music, exhibited in Vienna in 1809, another\nautomaton of singular power; which appeared\nin the uniform of a trumpeter in the Austrian\ndragoon regiment Albert, with his instrument\nplaced to his mouth. When the figure wu\npressed on the lei\\ shoulder, it played not only\nthe Austrian cavalry march, and all the signals\nofthat army, but also a march and allegro by\nWeigl, ,vhich was accompanied by the whole\norche.stra. The dreas of the figure was then\nchangedinto that of a French trumpeter of the\nguards, when it began to play a French cavalry\nmarch, all the. signals, the march of Dussek,\nand an allegro of Pleyel, accompanied again\nby the full orchestra. Maelzel publicly wound\nup his instrument only twice on the left hip.\nThe sound of the trumpet was pure and pe-\ncuJiarly agreeable.\n- About thirty years ago, Maillardet exhibited,\nin Spring Gardens, a variety of automata,\nwhich the writer\u00b7 had an opportunity of seeing\nat a lat,er period. One was the figure of a boy,\nwho wrote sentences, and drew certain objects\nwith remarkable promptitude and correctness.\nAnother was a pianiste, seated at a piano-forte,\non which she played eighteen tunes.

When the automaton was\nonce wound up, it would continue playing for\nan hour; and the principal part of the ma-\nchinery employed was freely exposed to public\nview. It has been doubted whether the music\nwas actually produced by the automaton: since\nthe time now referred to, the ,vriter has ex-\namined another, in which the keys of the in-\nstrument were certainly acted upon by the\ntouch.\nHe has also seen, at various times, several\nvery curious!y constructed automata: the figure\nof a lady, who could walk along a level sur-\nface, throwing out the limbs, and moving\nthe head from side to side; a tippler, who\ncould pour out wine from a decanter into a\nglass, open his mouth, and swallow the fluid,\nand thus proceed till the bottle was drained ;\nand a performer on the slack rope, whose ex-\nceedingly rapid movements of the body, the\narms, and the head, all consistent and graceful,\n,vere truly an1azing.\nA very beautiful automaton was exhibited,\na few years ago, in Paris, and subsequently in\nLondon, It appeared in a court suit, sitting\nat a table, in the attitude of writing. Several\nquestions, inscribed on tablets, were placed or.\nthe table on which the whole apparatus stood,\nand visitors might select any one or more at\npleasure. The tablet, containing a question, on\nbeing handed to the attendant, was placed iJi\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fUI\na drawer, and, as soon as it was closed, the\nfigure traced on paper an appropriate reply.\nOn the question being given, \" Who may be\nvolatile without a crime ?\" the answer was,\n\"A butterfly.\" And as the figure could draw\na response as well as write it, when the ques-\ntion was put, \"What is the symbol of fidelity ?\"\nit drew, in outline, the form of a greyhound.\nIn the same way it proceeded throughout the\nseries -0fquest!ons,\nIn some instances, the effect of automata is\nincreased by the exhibiter proposing certain\nquestions, and receiving responses from the\nfigure-as shaking the head, to denote a nega-\ntive; or nodding, to indicate assent. It ia\nevident that here the inquiries or remarks are\nthrown in to 8CCord\nwi..\nb the motions that the\nfigure is contrived to make. When, however,\na performer, as one has recently done, puts a\nwhistle in the mouth of an automaton, and\nthen,sitting down by its side, plays a tune on\na guitar, desiring the figure to accompany him;\nthe huty sounds with which the figure seems\ninclined to begin, the irregularity with which\nit proceeds,and the long and loud closing note,\nmay all be easily supplied by some confederate.\nSurprising.asare the e:fFects\nproduced by many\nattt.omata,it would be wrong to infer that their\nonly results are the wonder of the multitude,\norgain or applause to their inventors. \" They\ngave rise,\" as sir David Br~wster has re-\nmarked, \" to the most ingenious mechanical\ndevices,and introduced, among the higher\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\norder of artists, habits of nice and accurate\nexecution in the formation of the most delicate\npieces of machinery.\" Those combinations of\nwheels and pinions, which almost eluded ob-\nservation, \" reappeared \u00b7in the stupendous\nmechanistn of our spinning-machines and our\nsteam-engines.

For this,\nthe other member, Mr. Babbage, at once re-\nplied, that \" this was possible;\" and, persevering\nin the inquiry which had thus suggested itself,\nhe produced a machine for calculating . tables\nwith surprising accuracy.\nThe calculating part of the machinery oc-\ncupies a space of about ten feet broad, ten feet\nhigh, and five feet deep.

But, unhappily\nforthe tale, other impressions have been ob-\nserved besides those of the horse's feet; and it\nis affirmed by various naturalists, deserving of\ncredit, that they must have been made by very\ndifferent animals, at a remote period, before\nthe stone had completely hardened. Other\ninstances of the same kind might easily be\nlriven. In the British Museum, there is a slab\nhavingsinillar impressions, obviously produced\nB 8\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n42 TERRESTRIAL\nPHENOMENA.\nby the same means. It was dug from a great\ndepth; a mass of ~tone, many feet in thickness,\nhaving been formed above the layer which re-\nceived, in a soft state, the impression from the\nfeet of several anin1als.\nOther impressions, of v1hich ,ve read or hear,\nare nothing more than tricks of art. Such,\nmost probably, is the impression of the foot of\nBudda upon the Peak of Adam, at Ceylon; the\nprint of the foot of the idol Gaudama, in the\nBurmese empire, which has been three times\nreproduced; and most certainly this is the case\n,vith the so\u2022called impressions of the feet of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour, shown to the\npresent day, on Mount Olivet.\n'fhe cave of St. Paul, at Civita Vecchia, the\nformer capital of the island of ?tlalta, is an\nexcavation, about nineteen feet in height, and\nfifty in circu1nfcrence; in a soft, white, lime-\nstone rock, more friable than chalk. A belief\nthat the stone was endowed with miraculous\nmedical virtues, led people to Cilrry away large\nquantities of it during the sway of the knights.\nIn 1770, when visited by Brydone, the cave\nwas in the highest celebrity; not only every\nhouse in the island had a medical chest of it,\nbut large quantities were sent to different\ncountries in Europe, and even to the East\nIndies. It was supposed to have a miraculous\npower which preserved it from diminution;\nwhich may be accounted for by a natural law-\nthe calcareous process of formation still going\non-while its healing power is to be attributed\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fTHE LOGANSTONE. 43\nto its having some of the properties of inag\nnesia; which leads, according to Dr. Walsh, to\nits still being given as a purgative-sudorific in\neruptive or fever complaints.\nOne instanee of gross superstition, as con-\nnected with rocks, is too imp0rtant to be\nomitted. The trial by ordeal appears to have\nbeen very early practise4 among the Celtic\ntribes of Europe, who \"'.\"ere always under the\ninfluence of an artful and domineering priest-\nhood. Thus, it is ~aid that in cases of doubtful\naccusation the Druids made use of the rocking-\nstones which were common in Britain, and that\nthe culprit was acquitted Qf condemned accord-\ning as besucceeded or failed in shaking them.\nMason, \u00b7..alludes to this trial in the following\nlines:-\n\" Be.W yon huge\nAnd unknown sphere of li-l''ingadamant,\nWhich, poised by magic, rests its central weigl1t\nOn yonder pointed rock ; firm as it seems,\nBoeh is its stran~e and virtuous property,\nIt moves obseqU1ousto tile gentlest touch\nOf him whose heart ia pure; but to a traitor,\nThough e'en a giant's prowess nezyed bis arm,\nIt stands as fixed as Snowdon.\"\nA little knowledge would have disabused the\nmind of this delusion.

It is composed of a light-coloured\nfriablesandstone, about the same as the rest of\nthechain; but an inclined plane of almost im-\npalpable sand rises at an angle of about forty\ndegrees\nwith the horizon, and is bounded by a\nsemi-circle of .rocks, presenting broken, abrupt,\nand pinnacled forms, and ext;ending to the base\nof this remarkable hill. Its height is about\nfour hundred feet.\nLieutenant Wellsted observed, that_the shape\nand arrangement of the rocks resembled, in\nsome respects, a whispering-gallery; but he\naecertained, by experiment, that their irregular\nIUrlacerendered them but ill-adapted for the\nproduction of an echo. Seated on a rock at the\nbase .of the sloping eminence, he directed a\nBedouin to ascend; snd it ,vas not..till he had\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n46 TERRES'l'lUAL P,HENOIIENA.\nreached some distance that the lieutenant per-\nceived the sand in 1uotion,rolling down the hill to\nthe depth of a foot. It did not, however, descend\nin one continued stream, but, as the Arab\nscrambled upwards, it spread out laterally and\nabove, until a considerable portion of the sur-\nface was in motion. Ag the sand began to fall,\nthe sounds produced might be compared to the\nfaint strains of an Eoliaq: harp when its strings\nfirst catch the breeze. When the sounds be-\ncame more violently agitated by the increased\nvelocity of the descent, the naise more near1y\ntesen1hled that produced by dra,ving the moist-\nened fingers over glass. As it reached the base,-\nthe reverberations attained the loudness of\ndistant thunder,. causing the rock on which\n_lieutenant Wellsted was seated to ,ibrate\u00b7;\nand the camels, animals not easily frightened,\nbecame so alarmed, that their drivers could\nonly retain them with difficulty. The noise, it\nwas remarked, did not issue from every part of\n\u00b7the hill alike, the loudest being produced by\ndisturbing the sand on the northern side, about\ntwenty feet from the base, and about ten from\nthe rocks that bound it in that direction. 1'he\ntradition is, that the bells of a convent were\nLuried here; the Bedouins trace the sounds t;o\nseveral wild and fanciful causes; but, in the\nexperiment now described, it was evident that\nthe sounds sometimes fell quicker on the ear,\n~and at other titnes were more prolonged, ac-\ncording to the Arab's increasing or rPtarding\nthe velocity of his descent.\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fVJBKATWNS,\nDr. Chladni made many curious experi-\nments on the figures assumed by sand and\nsimilar substances, when strewed over vibrating\nsonorous bodies. The reader may easily try an\nexperiment of this kind. Let a square piece of\nglass be taken, such as that ueiedfor windows,\nnot less than four or fil'e inches over, the edges\nofwhieh are to be smoothed by grinding. Spread\nover the plate, as evenly as possible, a little\nsand, and, holding it between th.e thumb and\nfore-finger, in the middle, pass the bow of a\n-violin against one of its edges, drawing it either\nupwards or downwards, in a \u00b7direction perpen-\ndicular to its surface. A tremulous motion\nwill be immediately observed, and the 8811d\nwill assume some particular and fixed figure.\nIf the bow be pasaed over the middle of one\nof the sides, the sand will arrange itself in the\ndirection of ihe two diagonals, dividing the\nsquare into four isosceles triangles. If the bow\nbe applied at any point which is one-fourth the\nlength of the square from any angle, the\nvrangement of the sand will represent the two\ndiameters of the square, dividing it into four\nequal figures of the same form. If the square\nbe held at the two extremities of either dia\u2022\nmeter, and the bow be applied to tl1e extremities\nof the other diameter, the sand will take the\nfigure of an oval, having its major axis in the\nsame direction as one of the diameters.\nDi itiz by\nOther experiments of the same kind l1ave\nsince been made by II.

They always\nranged them~elves in the form of a curve, the\nconvexity of which was in proportion to the\npoint touched by the violin bo,v, or towards\nthe point which has an analogous situation;\nthe nearer that each of these little heaps was\nto these points, the greater was its height, a cir-\ncumstance which gave remarkable regularity\nto the figure. The interior of the small eleva-\ntions thus obtained, were in constant motion\nduring the continuance of the sound, and the\nduration of the vibrations might be observed\non a plate from four to six inches in diameter.\nAt one moment the height increased, at another\nit diminished, and the dust had the appearance\nof arranging itself in small globules, which\nrolled one above another.\nWe tnay now return from these very inter-\nesting facts, to others on a far larger scale.\nNear the Kom-el-Hett'an, or the mound of\nsand-stone, which makes the \u00b7site of one of\nthe palaces and temples of Amunoph m., art!\ntwo sitting colossi, which seem to 388ert the\ngrandeur of ancient Thebes. The easternmost\nof the two_is doubt.less the statue reported by\nancient authors to utter a sound at the rising\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fof the sun. It was said to resemble the bieak-\ning of a metallic ring, or harp-string. The\nsuperstition of its Roman visitors ascribed the\ncolOS8118\nto Memnon, and a multitude of inscrip-\ntions attributed to him miraculous powers.\nThe memory of ite daily performance is still\nretained in the traditional appellation of Sala-\nmat, \" salutations,\" by the modern inhabitants\nof Thebes. It is said to have \" saluted\" the\nemperor Adrian and his queen Sabina twice ;\nbut some persons, of course of humble rank,\nwere disappointed on their first visit, and\nobliged to return another morning to aatiafy\nI.heir curiosity.\nAnd yet there is ample reason to believe that\nthe whole was an artifice of the priest.a. In\nthe lap of the statue is a stone ; and as sir\nGardiner Wilkinson discovered, on examining\nthe inscriptions, that one Ballilla had compared\nthe sound the stone emitted, when struck, to\nthe striking of brass, he determined to put the \u00b7\nmatter to the test. Accordingly, posting some\npeasants below, and ascending to the lap of the\natatue, he struck the sonorous block with a\nsmall hammer, and inquiring what was heard\nby the peasants, they answered, \" You are\nstriking brass.\" \" This,\" says sir Gardiner,\n\" convinced me that the sound was the sound\nthat deceived the Romans, and led Strabo to\nobserve that it appeared\nto him as the effect of\na slight blow.\" \"The Theban priests,\" he\nadds,\" must have been considerable gainers by\nthe credulity of those who visited their lion.\"\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n50 TERRES1'RIAL PHENOMENA.\nThe reader who may have taken the delight-\nful walk from Tunbridge Wells to the High\nl?ocks, and examined particularly those huge\nmasses, will not fail to remember the one called\n\"the Bell Rock.\" On entering the space between\nthis one and the next, it may be struck with a\nstick, when a sound will be heard like that pro-\nduced, on a large metallic body being smitten.\nIn the road cut by Napoleon bet~een Savoy\nand France, and about two miles from Les\nEchelles, there is a gallery twenty-se?en feet\nhigh and broad, and nine hundred atld sixty\nfeet in length, formed in the solid rock. When\nthis road ,vas nearly complete, and the e:tcava-\ntions commenced at eaoh end almost tnet, the\npartition was broken through by a piek-axe,\nand a loud and deep sound was heard. We\nare indebted to Mr. Bakewell fur the fbllowing\nsolution of this pheno1nenon. The mountain\nrises full one thousand feet above\u00b7the passage,\nand. fifooenhundred above the valley. 'fhe air,\non the eastern side of the mountain 1is sheltered\nboth on the south and ,vest from the sun's\nrays; and consequently must be much colder\nthan on the western side. The mountain,\ntherefore, formed a partition between the hot\nair of the valley, and the cold air of the ravines\non the eastern side. When the opening was\nmade, the cold, and therefore denser air, rushed\ninto that rarefied by heat, and a loud report\nwas produced, in the same manner as when a\nbladder, placed over an exhausted air-pump\nreceiver, is burst.\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n0.1\nBaron Humboldt informs us, on credible\nauthority, that subterranean sounds, resembling\nthe tones of an organ, are heard on the banks\nof' the Oroonoko. He supp08es that they arise\nfrom a di1Ference of fiemperature betweenthe\nexternal atmosphere and the air confined in the\ncrevices of the adjacent granitic rocks. He\neoncludea that, as the temperature of the con-\nfined air is greatly increased during the day\nfrom the cond11etion of heat by the roeke; and\nas the duFerence of temperature between it and\nthe atm<>@pbere\nwill reach its maximum about\nsunrise, the sounds are produced by the escap-\ning current.\nThe following illustrative experiment is nol\na little curious :-If a tube formed of some\nelastic and sonorous substance be taken, and a\njet of inflamed hydrogen be introduced, a\nmusical sound will be heard. This will take\nplace in a tube closed at one end, if it be large\nenough to admit a sufficient quantity of atmo-\nspheric air to support the combustion of the\ngas ; but if the tuee be open at both extremi-\nties, the musical sound will be clear and full.\nVarious conclusions have been arrived at in\nreference to this phenomenon; but they have\nbeen set aside by the experiments of Mr. Fara-\nday, who attributes the sounds produced by\nflames in tubes to a continual series of detona-\ntions or explosions.\nThe first philosopher who exhibited the\u00b7\nlongitudinal vibration of solids was Dr. Chladni.\nAccording to him, t~e . best method of pro-\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n52 TERRESTRIAL\nPHENOMENA.\nducing these vibr$tions in rods, is by rubbing\nthem, in the direction of their length, with\nsome son substance, covered with powdered\nresin, or by the finger. When glass tubes are\nemployed, they should be rubbed with a piece\nof rag spread over with fine sand, the tube\nbeing held by one of the ends.\n\" In all longitudinal vibrations,\" says the\nsame writer, \"the tones depend merely on\nthe length of the sonorous body, and on the\nquality of the substance, the thickness and\nform being of no consideration ; yet the tones\nare not varied by the specific gravity of the\nvibrating substance ; for fir-wood, glass, and\niron, give almost the same tone as brass, oak,\nand the shanks of tobacco-pipes.\" He also\nmentions several kinds of longitudinal vibra-\ntion ; in one, to use his own words, \" there is a\ncertain point in the middle at which the\u00b7vibra-\ntion of each half-stops ; in the next there are\ntwo, each at the distance of a fourth part from\nthe end; and, in the following,there are three, or\nmore. The tones correspond with the natural\nseries of the numbers 1, 2, 8, 4, etc. If a rod\nbe fastened at one end, during the first kind of\nlongitudinal vibration, the alternate expansion\nand contraction of the whole rod will take place\nin such a manner, that they stop at the fixed\nend ; in the next tone there is a resting-point\nat the distance of one-third from the free end ;\nand in the followingthere are two.

It, however, became a\ndifficult question to determine in what way an\ninstrument of this kind should be constructed.\nAfter much and long-continued unsuccessful\nthought, he returned home one evening ex-\nhausted with walking, and he had scarcely\nclosedhis eyes to fall asleep in his chair, when\nthe arrangement he had so long been seeking,\noccurred to his mind. He soon after completed\nan instrument, which in every respect an-\nswered his expectations. \u00b7\nThe euphone, signifying an instrument hav-\ning a pleasant sound, consists of forty-one fixed\nand parallel cylinders of glass, equal in length\nand thickness. In its external appearance it\nresembles a small writing-desk, which, when\nopened, presents a series of glass tubes about\naixt.een inches long, and the thickness of a\nquill. They are fixed in a perpendicular\nsounding-board, at the back of the instrument.\nWhe~ used, the tubes are wetted with a\nsponge, and stroked in the direction of their\nlength with wet fingers; the intensity of the\nt'lne being varied by greater or less pressure.\nThe singular phenomenon of sound occa-\nsioned by. the vibration of soft iron, produced\nby a galvanic current; was recently discovered\nby Mr. Sage, and has been since verified by\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n54 TERRESTRl.AL\nPHENOMENA.\nthe observations of a French philosopher, M.\n1':Iarian. The experiments were made on a bar\nof iron, which was fixed at the middle, in a\nhorizontal position, each half being inclosed in\na large glass tube. By appropriate arrange~\nments, the galvanic circle was completed ; and\nthe longitudinal sound could be distinguished,\nalthough it was feeble. The origin of the\nsound has therefore been ascribed to a vi-\nbration in the interior of the iron bar; and to\nthe same cause are probably attributable many\nphenomena.\nWe now pass on 1D the violent agitation of\nthe air, which is often productive of surprising\nresult.c;.

The paper was contri-\nbuted by Mr. Clouston, of Stromness. \"One\nnight a heavy fall of snow took place, which\ncovered the plain to a depth of several inches.\n' Upon this pure carpet,' says the writer, ' there\nreste4 next morning thousands of large messes\nof snow, which contrasted strangely with iti\nsmooth surface.' These occurred generally in\npatches, from one acre to a hundred in extent,\nwhile clusters were often half-a-mile asunder.\nThe fields so covered looked as if they had\nbeen scattered over with cart-loads of manure,\nand the latter covered with snow ; but, on\nexamination, the masses were all found to be\ncylindrical, like hollow fluted rollers, or l~ea'\nswan-down muffs, bearing a strong resem-\nblance to the latter. The ,largest 1neasured 8-j-\nfeet long, and 7 feet in circumference.

They did not occur in any of\nthe adjoining parishes, and were limited to a\n,paceof about :fivemiles. The first idea, as to\nthe origin of these bodies, was, that they had\nfallen from the clouds, and portended so~e\ndirefulcalamity. But, had they fallen from the\natmosphere, their symmetry and loose texture\nmust have been destroyed. The writer having\nexamined them, ,vas soon convjnced that they\nDi itiz by\nOr1QI\nrid!

A few of the wonders connected\nwith this science may, therefore, appropriately\nfollow the terrestrial phenomena which have\njust been considered.\nDi itiz by\nThe Rom~sh ehurch has rendered chemistry\navailable in connexion with one of its prodigies,\nthe so-called blood of St. Januarius.

Let the phial which contains it when\ncoagulated, be held in the hand for a few min-\nutes, and the temperature of the substance\nrises, and it becomes fluid. Even the warmth\n-afa public assembly is sufficient for this pur-\npose.\nMarcms,the chief of one of the sects in the\nsecond century, who wished to amalgamate\nwith Christianity the doctrines and rules of\npagan rites,filled with white wine three cups\nof transparent glass; and, while he was pray-\ning, the liquid in one of the cups became like\nblood; in another, of a purple colour ; and\nin the third, sky-blue. But these effects might\neasily be produced by chemical action. Pro-\nfess-or Beyruss, at the court of the duke of\nBrunswick, promised that his white dress should\nbecome red during a repast; and the change\ntook place, to the astonishment of the prince\nand his guests. M. Vogel, who relates this\nfact, does not reveal the means employed ; but\nobserves that, by pouring lime-water on the\njuice of beet-root; a colourless liquid is obtained,\nthat a piece of cloth dipped in it and quickly\ndried becomes red in a few hours by the contact\nof the\u00b7 air alone; and that this effect may be\naccelerated in a room where champagne and\nOri\"'\nrial from\nDi itiz by\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n64 CHEMICAL\nWONDERS.\nother beverages charged with carbonic acid\n1sasare abundantly used. Still more rapidly\nn1ight the chang~ be .effected in some temple,\nin the midst of rising incense and burning\ntorches; and the veil which covered things\ndeemed sacred, might thus have been seen to\nchange from white to the colour of blood-a\npresage of fearfu.ldisasters.\nA series of remarkable experiments was per-\nformed by professor Boutigny, .at the British\nAssociation at Cambridge, in 1845. He com-\nmenced by showing, that when cold water is\npo~red on a hot metallic surface, the heat is not\ncommunicated to it; and that the water assumes\na spheroidal form, and continues to roll about,\nupheld at a minute distance from the heated\nsurface, without boiling. The water was poured\ninto a hot platinum cup kept in rapid motion,\nand resembled a small globe of glass dancing\nabout. There was no hissing noise nor appear-\nance of steam, though the globule of water\nmust, nevertheless, have evaporated rapidly;\nfor, after gradually diminishing in size, in the\ncourse of about t,vo minutes it disappeared.\nThe same result takes place when any substance\ncapable of assuming a globular form is placed\non a heated surface. In proof of this, the pro-\nfessor placed in the heated cup of platinum,\niodine, ammonia, and some inflammable sub.:.\nstances ; each of which became globular, and\ndanced about like the globule of water, bt!t\nwithout emitting smell or vapour, or being\ninflamed, witil the platinum cup was cooled.\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fAnother experiment was yet more curious.\nProfessor Boutigny heated a silver weight, of\ntbe same shape as the weight of a clock, until\u00b7\nit was red-hot, and then Io:weredit by a wire\ninto a glass of cold water, without there being\nany more indication of action in the water than\nif the weight had been quite cold. Professor\nBoutigny advanced no theory to account for\nthese peculiar actions, further than that a filin\nof vapour intervenes between the heated body\nand the substance, which prevents the com-\nmunication of heat. The facts, however, he\nthought were of importance in a practical point\nof view, both as regards the tempering of\nmetals, and in the explanation of the causes\nof steam-boiler explosions. It would seem,\nfrom experiments in tempering metals, that, if\nthe metal be tod much heated, the e1Fectof\nplunging it into water will be diminished. In\nsteam-boilers, also, if the heated water be in-\ntroduced into a heated surface, the heat may\nnot be communicated\u00b7 to the water, and the\nboiler may become red hot, and without any\ngreat emission of steam; until, at length, when\nthe boiler cools, a vast quantity of steam would\nbecome suddenly generated, and the boiler\nburst.\n\u00b7 The' last and most curious experiment per-\nformed by professor Boutigny, was the freezing\nof water in a red-hot vessel. Having heated a\nplatinum cup red-hot, he poured into it a small\nquantity of water; which was kept in a globular\nt=Jrm,as in the other experiments. He then\nC\nOri\"'\nrial from\nDi itiz by\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\ntifj CHEMICAL\nWONDERS.\npoured into the cup some liquid sulphurous\nacid; when a sudden evaporation ensued, and,\non quickly inverting the cup, there came out a\nsi:pall mass of ice. The principle of this ex..\nperiment, which called forth loud and continued\napp1ause, is this :-sulphurous acid has the\npr<>pertyof boiling water when it is at a tem-\nperature below the freezing point; and, when\npoured into the heated vessel; the suddenness of\nthe evaporation occasions a degree of cold suffi-\ncient to freeze water\u2022.\nLiquid carbonic acid takes a high position\nfor its freezing qualities. Mr. Adams, of\nKensington, manufactures this curious liquid as\nan article of commerce, and has, occasionally,\nas much as nine gallons of it in store. In\ndrawing it from its powerful reservoirs, it\nevaporates so rapidly as to freeze, and it is then\na light porous mass, like snow. If a small\nquantity of this is drenched with ether, the\ndegree of cold produced is even more intolerable\nto the touch than boiling water ; a drop or two\nof the mixture producing blisters, just as if the\nskin had been burned l Air. Adams states\nthat, in eight minutes he has frozen a mass of\nmercury weighing ten pounds.\nIn one department of knowledge-that of\nvapours and gases-on which chemistry casts\nso much light, we discover many remarkable\nphenomena. Few persons have resided, for ex-\nample, in the fenny and swampy districts of our\nisland, without seeing, at least occasionally, the\nignisfatuus, Will-o'-the-wisp, or Jack-o'-lantern,\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f..--- - -- ----\nhoveringa fewfeetabove the surfaceofst,apant\nwater.\n\" Wild fires dancing o'er the heath,\"\nmaybe observed, indeed, at almost all times ot\nthe year, but it is chiefly in autumn, and par-\nticularly in November, that they flit in muy\ncircles and irregular evolutions; aometimes at\nthe edge of a morass, over the tops of wit1lered\nsedges,reeds, and brushwood; and, at others,\nover palings and hedgerows, or the still surface\nofthe oozy bog.\nIt has been argued by some, that they are\neft'ects produced by luminous insects, as the\nglow-worm, the gnat, and the mole-cricket.\nBut this theory is very unsatisfactory, and the\ncause which is now generally acknowledged to\nbe the real one, is far more natural. There is\na substance r~dily obtained, but of very otFen-\nsive odour, called phosphoret of lime; and, if a\npiece of this be taken and dropped into a pool\nof water, little flames will he seen on its surface.\nThese arise from the power of the substance to\ndecompose water, in consequence of which, the\nhydrogen a111ends\nto the surface, and ignites on\ncoming in contact with the air.\nDr. Weissenborn has given the following\ninteresting statements:-\" In the year 1818,\nI was fortunate enough to get \u00b7a fine view\nof the ignes fatui operating on an extensive\nscale. I was ~en at Schnepfe~thal, in the\nduchy of Gotha; and in a clear- November\n-night,between eleven and twelve o'clock, when\nc2\nOri\"'\nrial from\nDi itiz by\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n68 CHEMICAL\nWONDERS.\nI had just undressed, the bright moonshine\nallured me to the window, to survey the expanse\nof boggy meadows, which spread two or three\nEnglish miles in length, a quarter-of-a-mile from\nthe foot of the hillock on which the house in\nwhich I then was, is standing. Through the first\nthird of the meadows there was a winding rivulet,\nof the breadth of seven or eight feet, which then\nturns oiF into an artificial bed, whilst the old\nbed continues in the direction of the meadows,\nwhich are bou\u00b5ded on one side by a range of\nbrushwood, and on the other by cultivated\ngrounds, with marshy dells here and there. My\nintimate acquaintance with the locality, together\nwith the bright moonshine, enabled me to dis-\ncover every object round the meadow-ground,\nsufficiently well to judge of the position and\ndirection of the luminous phenomena, the dis-\nplay of which I saw as soon as I had posted\nmyself at the window. I perceived a number\nof reddish yellow :flameson different part8\n~f the\nexpanse of almost level ground. I descried,\nperhaps, no more than six at a time, but dying\naway and appearing in other places so rapidly,\nthat it was impossible to count them; but I\nshould say, on a rough calculation, there were\nabout twenty or twenty-five within a second.\nSome were small and bur~d dimly; others\nflashed with a bright flame, in a direction\nalmost parallel with the ground, and coinciding\nwith that of the wind, which was rather brisk.\nAfter having for some time looked with amaze-\nment at the brilliant scene, ns a whole, I tried\nOr1QI\nrid! '11:)m\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fWILL\u00b7O'-THE-WISP. 69\nto study its details, and soon found that the\nflames which were nearest originated in a\nquagmire, the position of which I knew exactly,\nby a solitary cluster of willows; and I could\n. trace a succession of flashes from that spot to a\ncertain point of the margin of the wood across\nthe rivulet and meadow. The distance of the\ntwo points from each other was more than half-\na-mile, and the flames travelled over it, perhaps,\n\u00b7in less than a second. The first flash was not\nalways observed in the immediate neighbour-\nhood of the quagmire; but the succession of\nflames lay always in the same straight line, and\nin the direction of the wind; whilst other sets\nwere observed, though not with the same dis-\ntinctness, in the more distant parts of the\nmeadow-ground.\n\"After about an hour, a bank of mist began\nto overspread the meadows, but I saw the light\nstill glimmering through it, whilst I dressed\nmyself, in order to examine the phenomenon in\nits laboratory. However, when I reached the\nmeadows, the atmospheric conditions which\ngave rise to the ignes fatui had ceased to exist.\"\nWeissenbom then expresses his belief that the\nphosphoric hydrogen gas, exhaled by certain\nswamps, is kindled into flame by cQming in\ncontact with the atmospheric air; but, as the\nhydr gen is not saturated with phosphorus, (the\ngreater portion of the latter being precipitated\nin passing through the water as red oxide of\nphosphorus,) there is a certain electric condition .\nof the atmosphere necessary to cause the com-\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n70 CHEMICAL\nWONDERS.\nbustion. Thus, under common circumstances,\nthe gas is evolved and dissipated without being\nobserved; but when the state of the atmosphere\nis competent to effectits combustion, the proper\ndegree of electrical tension is lost at the place\nwhere the explosion is effected; and, until it is\nrestored, or the gas comes in contact with that\nlayer of the atmosphere which possesses the\nrequisite .degree of electrical tension, a consi-\nderable body of bog gas may collect, and be\ncarried in the direction of the wind, so as to\ngive rise to a sort of quick fire, with occasional\nflashes; in thoee places of the stream of gas\nwhere there happens\u00b7 to be a considerable\nvolume of it. The lights, which still frequently\nexcite apprehensions in Wales, and are popu-\nlarly termed \"corpse candles,\" have the same\norigin as the-\" ignes fatui.\"\nAt the village of Wigmore, in Herefordshir~\nthere are fields which may be, and two houses\nwhich -really are, illuminated with a natural\ngas. This vapour, with which the subjacent\nstrata seem to be charged, is obtained in the\nfollowing manner :-a hole is made in the cellar\nof the house, or other locality, with an iron\nrod; a hollow tube is then placed therein, fitted\nwith a burner similar to those used for ordinary\ngas-lights, and immediately on applying a flame\nto the jet, a soft and brilliant light is obtained,\nwhich may be kept burning at pleasure. The \u00b7\ngas is very pure, quite free from any offensive\nsmell, and does not stain the ceilings, as is\ngenerally the case with the manufactured\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fNATURAL.\nGAS. 71\nkrticle. Besides lighting rooms, etc., it ha,\n'Deenused for cooking ; and, indeed, seems\ntapable of the same applications as prepared\ncarburetted hydrogen. t There are several fields\nin which the phenomenon exists, and children\nare seen boring holes and setting the gas on\nfire for amusement. It is now several months\nsince the discovery was made ; and a great\nmany of the curious have visited, and still con-\ntinue to visit, the spot.\nIf the Chineseare not manwacturers, they are,\nnevertheless, gas consumers and employers on\na large scale; and have evidently been so, ages\nbefore the knowledge of its application was\nacquired by Europeans. Beds of coal are fre-\nquently pierced by the borers of salt water;\nand the inflammable gas is forced up in jets\ntwenty or thirty feet in height. From these\nfountains, the vapour has been conveyed to the\nsalt-works in pipes, and there used for the\nboiling and evaporation of the salt; other tubes\nconvey the gas intended for lighting the streets,\nand the larger apartments and kitchens. As\nthere is still more gas than is required, the\nexcess is conducted beyond the limits of the\nsalt-works, and forms separate chimneys or\ncolumns of flame.\nA singular counterpart to this employment\nof natural gas, is ,vitnessed in the valley of the\nKanawha, in Virginia. The origin, the means\nof supply, the application to all the processes of\nmanufacturing salt, and of the appropriation of\nthe surplus for the purposesof illumination, are\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n'12 CHEMICAL\nWONDERS.\nremarkably alike at such distant points as\nChina and the United States.\nIt has sometimes been stated of a departed\nperson, that a luminous a.ppearance wasobserved\nto rest upon, and occasionally to surround a\ncorpse. Such an effect has been described as\nsupernatural-a Divine attestation to extra-\nordinary excellence ; and, doubtless, Roman\nCatholics have n1ade the most of such circum-\nstances in reference to those ,vhom they have\ndenominated saints; and to whom a place has\nbeen assigned in their calendar. And yet there\nwas no departure in any such instance from the\nordinary laws of nature. Sir H. Marsh, in an\nessay on \" The Evolution of Light from the\nHuman Subject,'' states, that electric sparks\nhave been known to issue from the skin of some\nindividuals when rubbed lightly and quickly\nwith -a linen cloth. Not only }:lasthis physi-\ncian heard of such cases, but two had actually\ncome under his observation.\nlie was led to consider the subject by the\nfollowing statement made to him : \" About an\nhour and a half before my sister's death, we\nwere struck by appearances proceeding from\nher head, in a diagonal direction. She was, at\nthe time, in a half-recumbent position, and per-\nfectly tranquil. The light ,vas pale as the\nmoon, but quite evident to mamma, myself,\nand $isters, who \"rere watching over her at the\ntime. One of us, at first, thought that it was\nlightning ; till, shortly after, ,ve fancied we\nperceived a sort of tremulous glimmer playing\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fLUMIMOUS APPEARANCES. \"\/D\nround the head of the bed; and then, recollect-\ning that we had read something of a similar\nnature having been observed previous to dis-\nsolution, we had candles brought into the room,\nfearing our dear sister would perceive it, and\nthat it might disturb the tranquillity of her\nlast moments.\"\nA similar appe.arance around the person,\nand in the room, of a man who fell a sacrifice\nto lingering disease in a remote district of the\nsouth-west of Ireland, is recorded, All the\nwitnesses agree in having seen the light; many,\nhowever, came to the conclusion that it was\ncaused by supernatural agency, and a proof of\nmiraculous interposition, and. even evidence of\nDivine favour. Considerable excitement ,vu\noccasioned in the south of Ireland by the fol-\nlowing case, related by Dr. D. Donavan, in the\nDublin Medical Prus, Jan. 15, 1840 :-\" I\nwas sent for,\" the Doctor says, \"in December,\n1828, to see Harrington. He had been under\nthe care of my predecessor, and had been en-\ntered in the dispensary book as a phthisical\npatient; and, on reference to my note-book, I\nfind that the stethoscopic and other jndications\nof ph~is were indubitable. . He was\u00b7 under\nmy care for about five years; during which\ntime, strange to say, the symptoms continued\nat&tionary; and I had discontinued my attend-\nance for about two years, when the report\nbecame general, t~at ~ystel'!oue lights ~ere\nevery night seen m his cabin. The subJect\nattract,eda great deal of attention; and, like\nC 3\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n74 CHEMICAL\nWONDERS.\neverything else in Ireland, at once assumed a\nsectarian complexion; some attributing the\nlight to the miraculous interference of Heaven;\nothers, to the practice of the black art. Not\nregarding these views as affording an explana-\ntion of the mystery, I determined to subject\nthe matter to the ordeal of my own senses;\nand, for this purpose, visited the cabin for four-\nteen nights; and on three nights, only, did I\nwitness anything unusual. Once I perceived .\na luminous fog, resembling the aurora borealis,\nand twice \u00b7I saw the scintillations, like the\nsparkling phosphorescence sometimes exhibited\nby the sea infusoria. From the close scrutiny\n1 made, I can, with certainty, say, that no im-\nposition ,vas either employed or attempted.\nHow are these appearances to be accounted\nfor? In answering this question, I would ob-\nserve, that they are never seen but in cases of\nextensive disease, and when considerable alter-\nation of structure has taken place. Processes\nanalogous to decomposition are witnessed in\nthe h~man subject while the living principle\nremains.\"\nOn these, and similar facts, Dr. Marsh re-\nmarks : '' Disease is but a step toward disso\u2022\nlution, in which the vital powers are impaired;\nand, unless t4e malady be checked, by the use\nof proper means, a period will quickly ap-\nproach when the chemical action will entirely\nprevail over the whole frame. Phosphorescent\n1natter n1ay be generated in organic bodies at\na period of incipient decomposition; and when\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fwe consider that phosphuretted hydrogen un-\ndergoes spontaneous combustion, when brought\nin contact with the oxygen of the atmosphere,\nand that the component parts of which this\ngas is formed exist in the body in great abun-\ndance, an easy solation is at hand, accounting\nfor the luminous appearances which have been\nwitnessed in dissecting-rooms, in burial-grounds,\nand in marine substances, as well as on the\napproach of dissolution.\"\nThe Arabs are well known as believers in\nwonders ; and of Qne of their magicians, named\nSadoomeh, the following story is told. \"In .\norder to give one of his friends a treat, he took\nhim to the distance of about half-an-hour's\nwalk into the desert, on the north of Cairo, where\nthey both sat down upon the pebbly and sandy\nplain; and the magician having uttered a spell,\nthey suddenly foqnd themselves in the midst or\na garden, like one of the gardens of Paradise,\nabounding with flowers and fruit-trees of every\nkind, springing up from a soil covered with\nverdure brilliant as the emerald, and irrigated\nby numerous streamlets of the purest ,vater.\nA repast of the most delicious viands and fruit\nwas spread before them by invisible hands;\nand they both ate and drank to satiety, taking\ncopious draughts of the various wines. At\nlength the magician's guest sank into a deep\nsleep, and when he awoke he found himself\nagain in the pebbly and sandy plain, with\nSadoomeh still by his side.\" \"The reader will\nprobably attribute this vision,\" says Mr. Lane,\nDi itiz by\nOr1QI\nr01 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n,u\nwho relates the tale, \" to a dose of opiun1 or\nsome similar drug; and such I suppose to have\nbeen the means employed ; for I cannot doubt\nthe integrity of the narrat.o~, though he would\nnot admit such an explanation; regarding the\nwhole as an affair of magic, 'jinn,' or genii.''\nA story of Gassendi, one of the most dis-\ntinguished of naturalists, mathematicians, and\nphilosophers of France, in the sixteenth cen-\ntury, will place this solution in a still clearer\nlight. As he was taking a morning walk near\nDeigne, in Provence, his ears were assailed by\nrepeated exclamations of \" A sorcerer ! a sor-\ncerer I\" On glancing behind him, he beheld a\nmean and simple-looking man, with his hands\ntied, whom a mob of the country-people were\nhurrying to prison. Gassendi's character and\nlearning had given him great authority with\nthem, and he desired to be left alone with the\nman. They immediately surrendered him,\nand Gassendi said to him, in private,\u2022 \" My\nfriend, you must tell me sincerely, whether you\nhave tnade a compact with the devil or not: it\nyou confess it, I will give you your liberty im-\nmediately; but, if you refuse to tell me, I will\ngive you immediately int.o the hands of a ma-\ngistrate.\" The man answered, \"Sir, I will\nown that I go to a meeting of wizards every\nday. One of my friends has given me a drug,\nwhich I take to effect this, and I have been\nreceived as a sorcerer these three ye.ars.\" He\nthen described the proceedings of these meet-\nings, and spoke of the duferent devils,as if he\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nTHE SORCERER\nUNDECEIVED. 77\nhad been all his life acquainted with then1.\n\" Show me,\" said Gassendi, \" the dn1g which\nyou take to attend this infernal meeting, for I\nintend to go there with you to-night.\" The\nman replied, \" As you please, Sir; I will take\nyou at midnight, as soon as the clock strikes\ntwelve.\" Accordingly, he met Gassendi at the\nappointed hour, and, showing him two boluses,\neach of the size of a walnut, he desired him to\nswallow one, as soon asGa111endi\n.Iiad seen him\nswallow the other, and then they lay down to-\ngether on a goat-skin. The man soon fell asleep,\nbut Gassendi i:emained awake and watched him,\nand perceived'tbat he was greatly disturbed in\nhis slumbers, and writhed and twisted his body\nabout, as if he bad been troubled by bad\ndreams. At the expiration of five or six hours\nhe awoke, and said to GasHendi, \" I am sure,\nSir, you ought to be satisfied with the manner\nin wbirch the great goat received you; _hecon-\n:ferred on you a high honour wl1enhe permitted\nyou to kiss his tail the first time he ever saw\nyou.\" It ,vas thus apparent that the dele-\nterious opiate had operated upon his imagina-\ntion. Gassendi, compassionating his weakness\nand credulity, took pains to convince him of\nhis self-delusion; and, sho,ving him the bolus,\nhe gave it to a dog, who soon fell asleep, and\nsuffered great convulsions.

The plant is\na species of hemp; the smoking of which is\nconsidered so delightful, according to Dr.\nThomson, as to have been denominated by such\nepithets as \"Assuager of sorrow,\" \"Increaser\nof pleasure,\"\" Cementer of friendship,\"\" Laugh-\nter-mover,\" and others of the same kind.\nOn the same authority it is stated, that in\nNepaul, the l'esin only is used; in some places\nit is collected by native coolies,walking through\nthe fields of hemp at the time the plants give\nforth the resin, which, adhering to the skin, is\nscraped off'from it, and kneaded into balls. It\nis taken in doses, from a grain to two grains,\nand causes a delightful delirium. When re-\npeated, however, it is followed by catalepsy, or\nthat state of insensibility which allows the body\nto be moulded into any form like a Dutch-\njointed doll, the limbs remaining in the position\nin which they. were placed, though contrary to\nthe law of gravity, and continuing so for many\nhours.\nWe are well acquainted with various means\nof acting in an extraordinary manner on the\n-human frame. The writer, in common with\nmultitudes, has witnessed, for example, the\noperation of nitrous oxide, often called \" the\nlaughing-gas.\" It acts, however, very differ- \u00b7\nently on. different persons; some laugh immo-\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f'111B\nLAUGIIING-GAS. 79\nderately, others become depressed, others assume\nthe airs of vanity and importance which accord\nwith their most cherished dispositions; and\nsome can only be forcibly restrained from deeds\nof great violence. It is certainly a most sin-\ngular sight to see a person laughing most\nboi&t,erously,or strutting with all the hauteur\nof a newly-made potentate, suddenly subside as\nthe action of the gas ceases, into a very unob-\ntmsive individual.\nWe may now briefly allude t;o one of the moat\nextraordinary applications of the present times.\nThe late air Humphry Davy made many ex-\nperiments on the effects of various gases on the\nhuman lungs. He found, in his own person,\nthat the inhalation of nitrous oxide removed\nhead-ache, and greatly aS8Uaged\nthe pain of cut-\nting a wisdom-tooth. . In his works, edited by\nDr. Jolin Davy, is the following passage:-\n\" As nitrous oxide, in its extensive operation,\nappears capable of destroying physical pain, it\nmay probably be used\u00b7 with advantage during\nsurgical operatioM in which no great effusion\nof blood takes place.\" Here is the germ of the\nrecent application of ether. \u00b7\n\u00b7 \"The e:ffectsof this inhalation; as indicated\nby the patient's own recollection,\" says a writer\nin the North British Review,\" are very various.\nIn general they are somewhat as follows:-A\npleasing sense of soothing succeeds the first\nirksomeness of the pungent vapour-a soothing\nof both mind and body.

The limbs are felt\n\u00b7cold and powerless; the hands and feet first,\nthen the knees; and the feeling is as if these\nparts had ceased to be peculiar property, and\ndropped away. This sensation may gradually\ncreep over the whole frame ; the patient becom-\ning, in more senses than one, truly etherealized;\nreduced to the condition of no body and aQ.\nsoul. The objects around are either lost sight\nof or strangely perverted; fancied shadows flit\nbefore the eyes, and then a dream sets in-\nsometimes calm and placid, sometimes active\nand bustling, sometimes very pleasurable,\nsometimes frightful, as a nightmare. Emerging,\nthe figures and scenes shift rapidly, and grow\nfainter and fainter; present objects are caught\nby the eye once more, the ringing of the ears\nis heard again, consciousness and self-control\nreturn, a tendency to excited talking is very\nmanifest, movement is unsteady, and, both in\nmind and body, a kind of intoxication is de-\nclared. It is, however, of a light and airy\nkind; very pure, very pleasant, and very pass-\ning, and, when gone, leaving very little trace\nbehind. \u00b7 \u2022 .\n\" Experience has fully shown that the brain\nmay be acted on so as to annihilate, for the\ntime, what may be termed the faculty of feel-\ning pain ; the organ of general sense may be\nlulled int-0 profound sleep, while the organ of\nspecial sense, and the organ of intellectual\nfunction remain wide awake, active, and busily\nemployed.

Patients\nhave said, quietly, 'You are sawing now,' dur-\ning the use of the saw in amputation ; and\nnfterwards they have declared most solemnly,\nthat though quite conscious of that part of the\noperation, yet they felt no pain. We have\nseen a patient enduring amputation of a limb\n.without any sign of suWering,opening her eyes\nduring the performan~, at its most painful\npart, descrying a country practitioner at some\ndistance-under whose care she had formerly\nbeen, and whom she had not seen for some\nconsiderable time-addressing him by name,\nand requesting that he might not leave town\nwithout seeing her.\"\nSince the period to which the writer just\nquoted refers, Dr. Simpson, of F..,dinburgh,has\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n82 CHEMICAL\nWONDERS.\ndiscovered a substitute for sulphuric ether--\nchloroform, or the perchloride of formyle. It is\nstated to possess over sulphuric ether the follow-\ning advantages :-1. A greatly less quantity\nof chloroform than of ether is requisite to pro-\nduce the desired e:ffect. 2. Its action is much\nmore rapid and complete, and generally more\nenduring. 8. The inhalation and influence or\nchloroform are far more agreeable and pleasant\nthan those of ether. 4. The use of chloroform\nis less expensive thin that of ether. 6. Its\nodour is not unpleasant ; nor does it exhale\nin a disagreeable form from the lungs of the\npatient, as so generally happens with sulphuric\nether. 6. Being required in much less quan-\ntity, it is much more port.able and transmiu-\nible than sulphuric ether. 7. No special kind\nof inhaler or in.strument is necessary for its ex-\nhibition. A little of the liquid diffused upon\nthe interior of a hollow-shaped sponge, or on a\npocket-handkerchief, or a piece of linen or\npaper, or held over the mouth and nostrils, so\nas to be fully inhaled, generally suffices, in\n.\n11bouta minute or two, to produce the effect.\nThis agent, how(tver,v requires to be used to\nannul pain under the direction of a judicious\nmedical practitioner; it may otherwise be pro-\nductive of serious consequences. \u00b7\nA prodigious force often arises from chemical\naffinity. Of this, gunpowder presents a familiar\ninstance. It is formed of nitre, sulphur, and\ncharcoal, which, in the ordinary state, are only\ncombined mechanically : hut no socner is this\nOr1QI\nr01 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fOUN-COTTON. 83\ncompound ignited, than these mbstances are\nbrought, by cl1emical action, into such close\ncontact, as to evolve a mighty and destructive\npower. It seemed likely to be thrown into the\nshade by the discovery of gun-cotton as an ex-\nplosive agent, which excited extraordinary in-\nterest throughout Europe. ~ projectile expe-\nriments being made, a gun, charged with thirty\ngrains of prepared cotton, prope1led an equal\ncharge of shot, with greater force and precision,\nat a distance of forty yards, than were gained by\nthe same gun loaded with a hundred-and-twenty\ngrains of gunpowder. A rifle, charged with\nfifty-four and-a-half ~ains of gunpowder, sent\na ball through seven boards, half-an-inch in\nthickness, at a diatance of forty yards; the\nsame rifle, charged with forty grains of gun-\ncotton, caused the ball to enter the eighth board.\nAnother rifle, which had been used for elephant-\nshooting, and conBequently carried a much\nlarger balI, charged with forty grains of gnn-\n\u00b7cotton, forced the ball through eight boards,\nat a distance of ninety yards. In no cue was\nthe discharge accompanied by a greaim recoil\nthan usual ; and the reports were not louder\nthan those accompanying the discharge of guns\nand rifles loaded with gunpowder. According\nto the specification of the patentee, M. Schon-\nbein, cotton ie preferred for this purpose, freed\nfrom extraneous matters; and it is considered\ndesirable to operate on the clean fibres of the\ncotton in a dry state, by means of nitric and\nsulphuric acids. These are mixed together in\nDi itiz by\nOr1QI\nrid! '11:)m\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n84\n\u2022\nCHEMICAL\nWONDEit~.\nthe proportion of one measure of nitric acid to\nthree measures of sulphuric acid, in any suit-\nable or convenient vessel not liable to be\naffected by the acids. A great degree of heat\nbeing generated by the mixture, it is left to\ncool until its temperature falls to sixty or fifty\ndegrees Fahrenheit. The cotton is then im-\nmersed in it ; and, in order that it may become\nthoroughly saturated with the acids, it is stirred\nwith a rod of glass, or other material, not\naffected by the acids. The cotton should be\nintroduced in as open a state as prnctjcable.\nThe acids are then poured or drawn off',and\nthe cotton gently pressed by a presser of glaz~d\nearthenware, to take out the acids, after which\nit is covered up in the vessel, and allowed to\nstand for about an hour. It is subsequently\nwashed in a continuous :flowof water, until the\npresence of the acids is not indicated by the\nordinary test of litmus paper. To remove any\nuncombined portions of the acids which may\nremain after the cleansing process, the patentee\ndips the cotton in a weak solution of carbon~te\nof potash, composed of one ounce of carbonate\nof potash to one gallon of water, a~d partially\ndries it by pressing, us before. The cotton is\nthen highly explosive, and n1ay be used in that\nstate ; but, to increase its explosive power, it is\ndipped in a weak solution of nitrate of potash,\nand, lastly, dried in a room heated by hot air,\nor steam, to about one hundred and fifty degrees\nFahrenheit.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of this\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fsubstance have thus been stated by professor \u00b7\n'Brande :-\" The disadvantages are, that the\n\u00b7 effects are less regular than those of gunpow-\nder ; that it is more dangerous, because inflam-\ning at a lower temperature ; that it does not\ntake fire ,vhen compressed in tubes ; that it\nburns slowly in all kinds of cartridges; that\nguns and pistols must be altered to admit of\nits use; that it is not adapted for the use of the\narmy; that the barrel of the gun is moistened\nby the water produced during combustion.\nThe advantages, on the other hand, may be\nstated as follows :-Its extreme cleanliness,\nleaving no residue after combustion ; its free-\ndom from all bad smell ; the facility and the\nsafety of its preparation; the possessing treble\nthe force of gunpowder; \u00b7itsexplosion producing\nno smoke, and less noise than that of gun-\npowder; its fi)amP.ntary nature admitting of its\nbeing used over head in mining operations ;\nits not being liable (as a granulated substance\nis) to the accidents of leakage ; its occasioning\nvery little recoil.\"-Every benevolent mind must\nwish to hear no more of '' the confused noise of\nbattle and of garments rolled in blood;\" and\nthat the time may soon arrive when men shall\n\" beat their swords into ploughshares, and\ntheir spears into pruning-hooks ;\" when \" they\nshall learn war no more,\" but yield themselves\nheartily and devotedly to the benjgnant sway\nof the Prince of peace. There seems, however,\nno reason to conclude that gun-cotton will be\nemployedfor any hostile purpose, the Bonrd of\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nCHEMICAL\nWONDERS.\nOrdnance having definitely decided against its\nadoption in the military and naval services. The\nprincipal objection to it is, the very low tem-\nperature at which it explodes. The mere heat-\ning of a gun, from a number of charges success-\nive!y fired, has been proved sufficient to cause\nan instant explosion of gun-cotton.\nIn mining, it b likely to be of great use. In\nthe slate-quarries at Penrhyns it has been found\nfar superior to gunpowder. A huge mass ot\nsixty tons' weight, for instance, was gently\npushed from its firmly compacted bed by the\nexplosion of only eigqt ounces of cotton, while\nthe slate was not splintered. In other great\nworks it will also be of service. In a cutting\non the Syston and Peterborough railway, not far\nfrom Stamford, experiment.a showed the ave-\nrage powers of the gun-cotton to be in the\nproportion of one to six of gunpowder ; so that,\nin a hard freestone foundation, about five feet\nthick, and with an entire depth of twenty-eight\nfeet, where six holes were necessary for gun-\npowder, only one was required for gun-cotton.\nIn all blasting operations, whether in open cut-\ntings, tunnels, or deep mines, a great saving or\ntime, labour, and cost, is thus likely t,o be\neffected.\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fCHAPTER VI.\nLkllt and its phenomena-Magic oicturee-The oi,taealpara-\ndox-Chinese metallic mirron-~ffect of an optlcal in1tru-\nment on a 1upentitious mind-Origin of photography-The\nTalbotype-The Daguerreotype-Sunlight pictures.\nTHE cause of those sensations which we refer\nto the eyes, or that which produces the sense\nof seeing, is light.

Stanislaus Julien,\non the metallic mirrors made in China, and to\nwhich the name of \" magic mirrors \" has been\ngiven. Hitherto all attempts by Europeans to\nobtain information as to the process, in the\nlocalities where they are manufactured, have\nproved failures, some of the persons applied to\nbeing unwilling to reveal the secret, and others\nbeing ignorant of the process. These mirrors .\narecalled magical, because, if they receive.the\nrays of the sun on their polished surface, the\ncharacters, or flowers in\u00b7relief,whjch exist on\nthe other side, are faithfully reproduced. The\nfollowing information has been obtained by M.\nJulien, from the writings of an author named\nOu-tseu-hing, who lived between 1260 and\n1341 :-\" The cause of this phenomenon is the\ndistinct use of fine copper and rough copper.\n. If, on the under side, there be pr~uced, by\ncasting in a mould, the figure of a dragon in a\ncircle, there is then engraved deeply on the\ndisc a dragon exactly similar. Then, the parts\nwhich have been cut are~ filled with rather\nrough copper; and this is, by the action of fire,\nincorporated with the other metal, which .is of\na finer nature. The face of the mirror is next\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f\u00b7-...\nDi itiz by\n90 PBENOMXNA\nor LIQRT.\nprepared, and a slight coating of tin is spread\n\u00bbver it. If the polished disc of a mirror so\nprepared be turned t;owards the sun, and the\nimage be reflected on a wall, it presents dis-\ntinctly the clear portion and the dark portion,\nthe one of the fine, and the other of the rough\ncopper.\" Ou-tseu-hing states, that he had\nascertained this by a careful inspection of the\nfr.cigmentsof a broken mirror.\nIt is easy for an ignorant and superstitious\nmind to confound a very har,JDlessand simple\ninstrument with one of magical power. We\nhave an example of this in Dodwell's descrip-\ntion of his residence at Athens. On his first\nadmission within the venerable walls of the\nAcropolis, it was necessary to o1Fer a small\n1>resentto the disdar, or Turkish governor,\nand an additional sum to make drawings and\nobservations without being molested by the\nservants of the garrison. The disdar proved\nto be a man of bad faith and insatiable rapa -\ncity, and, after experiencing numerous vexa-\ntions from the mercenary Turk, Dodwell was\nat length released from his importunities by a\nsingular circumstance. \u00b7As he was one day\nengaged in drawing the Parthenon, with the\naid of his camera obscura, the disdar, whose\nsurprise was excited by the novelty of the\nsight, asked, with a sort of fretful inquietude,\nwhat new conjuration he ,,.as performing with\nthat extraordinary machine. Dodwell endea-\nvoured to explain it, by putting in a clean sheet\nof paper, and making him look at the instru-\nOri\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fI..,\nTHE DISDil PERPLEXED. 91\n.\nment ; but he no sooner saw the Temple of\nMinerva reflected on the paper in all its lines\nand colours, than he imagined the eff'ectwas\nproduced by some magical process ; his aAto-\nnishment appeared mingled with alarm, and,\nstroking his long black beard, he repeated seve-\nral times the words Allah, Masch-Allah-a term\nof admiration with the Turks, signifying that\nwhich is made by God.\nAgain he looked into the camera obscura,\nwith a kind of cautious diffidence, and, at that\nmoment, sorne of his soldiers happening to pass\nbefore the re1lecting-glass,were beheld by the\nastonished disdar walking upon the\u00b7 paper.\nHe now became outrageous ; he assailed Dod-\nwell with various opprobrioua epithets, one of\nwhich was Bonap~the appellation being\nat the time synonymous to that of magician, or\nof any one supposed to be endowed with super-\nnatural talents-and declared that, if Dodwell\nchose, he might take away all the stones in the\ntemple, but that he would not permit his sol-\ndiers to be conjured into a box. \" When I\nfound,\" says Dodwell, \" that it was no use to\nreason -withhis ignorance, I changed my tone,\nand told him that, if he did not leave me un-\nmolested, I would put him into my box; and\nthat he should find it a very difficult matter to\nget out again. His alarm was now visible;\nhe immediately retired, and ever after stared\nat me with a mixture of apprehension and\namazement. When he saw me come to the\nAcropolis,he carefully avoided my approach;\nDi itiz by\nOr1QI\nr01 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f92' PHENOMENAOF LIGHT.\nand never afterwards gave me any further\nmolestation.\"\nThe portable camera obscura, represented\nby the diagran1, has often yielded much plea-\nsure in the domestic circle, while the larger\nones, ,vhich are publicly exhibited, are high ly\ninteresting . No person, perhaps, has witnessed\nthe neatness of outline, the precision of form,\nthe truth of colouring, and the sweet gradatio ns\nof tint, thus apparent, without regretting that\nan imagery so exquisite and faithful to natur e\ncould not be made to fix itself permanently on\nthe tablet of the machine. Yet, in the esti-\nmation of all, such a wish seemed destined to\ntake its place among other dreams of beautif ul\nthings; the splendid but impracticable con-\nceptions in which men of science and ardent\ntemperament have sometimes indulged. Such\na dream, however, has been realized of late.\nMr. Thomas Wedgewood, the celebrat ed\nporcelain manufacturer, so early as 1802, pub-\nlished, in the journals of the Royal Instituti on,\nDigitizedi::; Go gle 0!1glM 'mm\nINDIA~ UNIVERSfTY\n\fa method of copying paintings upon glass, and\nof making profiles by the agency of light upon\nnitrate of silver. The experiments he made\nwere repeated by sir Hu.mphry Davy ; but\nseveral yearsafter, MM. Niepc~ and Daguerre,\nand Mr. Fox Talbot, laid the foundation of\nthe present state of photographic drawing.\nThe former engaged in a long series of experi-\nments to render metallic surfaces peculiarly\nsensitive; the aim of the latter was to produce\nthis effect on paper. The camera obscura\nused for this purpose-is a rectangular box, with\na double convex lens, A, at one end, and a\nglass reflector, B, which is generally a piece of\nlooking-glass, at the other. Now, supposing\nthe rays of light to proceed from an extensive\nlandscape, and pass through this small convex\nlens, as we ,veil know they may do, what will\nbe the effect produced ? The scene will, in\nthe first place, be tlu\u00b7own on the reflector,\nwhich is fixed at an angle of forty-five degrees\nto the horizon. Now it follows, from a law\nwellkno,vn to opticians, that these rJ.ys ,vill be\nreflected to the top of the box, immediately\nover the mirror; so that if a ground glass, or\n\u00b7&rJ.y\nother medium capable of receiving the\nDi itiz by Ori\"'\nrial from\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nreflected image, be placed there, a representa-\ntion of the landscape may be observed. As\nthen, it is proved, by innumerable experiments,\nthat reflected light has, in proportion to its\npower, as much influence on prepared or pho-\ntographic paper, as the direct rays of the sun;\nit follows that, if a piece of it be placed in the\nsame situation as the ground glass, the re-\nflected image, be it a landscape, a figure, or an\nartificial object, will be formed on it. All that\nis, therefore, required to be done, in using the\ncamera obscura for photographic drawing, is to\nplace upon the opening at the top of the box\nthe prepared paper, and immediately to cover\nit with the lid, c, so that it may not be acted\nupon by any other light than that reflected\nfrom the mirror. The time required for pro-\nducing the necessary effect will depend on\nseveral circumstances, such as the preparation\nof the paper and the intensity of the light when\nthe experiment is made; the latter, however,\nis by far the more important. On a bright\nsun-shining day, the drawing will be produced\nin one-half the time, and with far more sharp-\nness of outline, than on a dull wintry day,\nwhen the sun struggles with the mists by\nwhich its radiant beams are encumbered.-\n\"The Pencil of Nature,\" is the expressive title\nof a collection of photographic drawings, pro-\nduced by Mr. Talbot. Upon the third part of\nthis work, we find the following acute criticism\nin the Athen<BUm,\nNo. 920.\n\" The subjects are ' 'fhe Entrance Gateway of\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fQueen's College, Oxford;' ' The Ladder,' in\nwhich we have three figures from the life ;\nand ' A View of the Author's Residence,\nLacock Abbey, in Wiltshire.' In the first ot\nthese, the truth-telling character of photo-\ngraphic pictures is pleasingly shown. It ap-\npears, by the turret clock, that the view was\ntaken a little after two, when the sun was shin-\ningobliquely upon the building. The story of\neverystone is told, and the crumbling of its\nsurfaceunder the action of atmospheric infiu-\nences is distinctly marked. The figures in\n' The Ladder' are prettily arranged, but the\nfaceof the boy is distorted, from the circum-\nstanceof its being so very near the edge of the\nfield of vieV? embraced by the lens of the\ncamera obscura. In looking at this photo-\ngraph,we are led at once to reflect on the truth\nto nature observed by Rembrandt, in the dis-\nposition of his lights and shadows. We have\nno violent contrasts; even the highest lights\nand the deepest shadows seem to melt into each\nother, and the middle tints are but the har-\nmonizing gradations. Without the aid of\ncolour,with simple brown and white, so charm-\ning a result is produced, that, looking at the\npicture from a little distance, we are almost led\nto fancythat the introduction of colour would\nadd nothing to its charm.\" _\nThe following is ~he patent process for ob-\ntaining a negative picture :-Take a sheet of\npaper,with a smooth su.rfacet and a close and\neven texture, and without the water-mark, and\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\ntlV\n\"'ash one side of it, by means of a soft camel's\u2022\nhair brush, with a solution composed of one\nhundred grains of crystallized nitrate of silver\ndissolved in six ounces of distilled water,\nhaving previously marked with. a cross the side\nwhich is to be washed. When the paper has\nbeen dried cautiously at the fire, or spon-\ntaneously in the dark, immerse it for a few\nn1inutes (two minutes, at a temperature of\nsixty-five degrees,) in a solution of iodide of\npotassium, consisting of five hundred grains to\none pint of distilled water. The paper is then\nto be dipped in water, and then dried, by ap-\nplying blotting-paper to it lightly, and after-\nwards exposing it to the l1eat of a fire, or\nallowing it to dry spontaneously. The paper\nthus prepared is called iodized paper, and may\nbe kept for any length of time .in a portfolio\nnot exposed to light. When a sheet of paper\nis required for use, wash it with the following\nsolution, which we shall call No. 1; take one\nhundred grains of nitrate of silver, dissolved in\ntwo ounces of distilled ,vater, and add to this\none-third of its volume of strong acetic acid.\nMake another solution, No. 2, by dissolving\ncrystallized gallic acid in cold distilled water,\nand then mix the two solutions together in\nequal proportions, and in no greater quantity\nthan is required for immediate use, as it will\nnot keep long without spoiling.

After re1naining in the\ncamera from ten seconds to several minutes,\naccording to the intensity of the light, it is\ntaken out of the camera in a dark room. If\nthe object has been strongly illuminated, or if\nthe paper has been long in the camera, a sen-\nsible picture will be seen on the paper; but, if\nthe time of exposure has been short, or the\nillumination feeble, the paper will \" appear\nentirely blank.\" An invisible image, however,\nis impressed on the paper, and may be ren-\ndered apparent by the following process :-\nTake some of the gallo-nitrate of silver, and,\nwith a soft camel's-hair brush, wash the paper\nall o\\'cr with this liquid, then hold it before a\ngentle fire, and, in a short time, the image will\nbegin to appear; and those parts upon which\nthe light has acted most strongly will become\nbrown or biack, while the others remain white.\nThe image continues to grow more and more\ndistinct for some time, and, when it becon1es\nIUfficientJy\nso, the operation must be tern1inated,\nD\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n98 PHENOMENA\nOF LIGH'l'.\nand the picture fixed. In order to effect this,\nthe paper must be dipped first int.owater, then\npartly dried by blotting-paper,. and afterwards\nwashed with a solution of bromide of potassium,\nconsisting of one hundred grains of the salt,\ndissolved in eight or ten ounces of water. The\npicture is then finally washed in water and\ndried as before.

No\nsooner was the camera fixed on the edge of the\ncrat.er, and the sensitive paper introduced, than\na partial irruption took place, and the ~raveller\nhad to fly for his life. On the cessation of the\nirruption, he returned; doubtless, with the ex-\npectation of merely collectiJlgthe fragments of\nhis valuable instrument; when, to his great\naat.onishment and delight, he discovered not\nonlythat his camera was absolutely uninjured,\nbut that it contained an admirable represent&\u2022\ntion of the crater and the irruption.\nA brief account of the process of the Dague~-\nreotypemay now be given. A plate of silvered\ncopper, about as thick as a ahilling, is well\ncleaned and polished by rubbing it with cotton,\nfine pumice powder, and dilute nitric acid, and\n\u00b7afterwards.exposed to the heat of a spirit-lamp,\nplaced below it, till a strong white coating is\n(ormed on the polis_hedsurface. On the plate\nbeing cooled suddenly by means of a cold slab\nof atone or of metal, the white coating is re-\nmoved by repeatedly polishing it with dry\npumice and cotton, and t\u00b5en three times more\n\u00b7withthe dilute nitric acid and pumice powder.\nA careful cle$ning bWlg thus given to the\nplate, it is placed in a box containing i~ t\u00b5l\nDi itiz by\ng\n\u2022 North Britiab Baview.\nD 2\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nJ.VV rll~NOll.t:NA OJ-4'\nLIGt,T \u2022\nit becon1esvisibly covered\u00b7 ,vith a golden fihn\nof that substance, which must neither be pale\nnor purple. It is then placed in the camera\ntill a distinct picture of whatever appears\nbefore it is forn1ed upon the surface; it remains\nthere for a period depending on the intensity of\nthe light, and is then removed to a metallic box,\nhaving in it a cup containing at least three\nounces of mercury. Placed below the cup is a\nspirit-lamp, which throws off the mercurial\nvapour; and, in exact proportion as this vapour\ndeposits itself on the parts of the plate ,vhich\nhave been acted upon by the light, is the\npicture developed on the surfacE-'\nof the plate,\nby the adhesion of the white mercurial vapour\nto the different parts which had been impressed\nby the light. As soon as the picture appears\nc01nplete, the plate is placed in a trough of\nsheet-copper, containing either a saturate,~\nsolution of common salt, or a weak solution of\nhyposulphite of soda. Thus, the coating of\niodine will be dissolved, the yellow colour quite\ndisappearing; hot, but not boiling, distilled\n,vater is then poured over the plate, and any\ndrops ,vhich re1nain are removed by blowing\nupon them.\n. The picture being now finished, is preserved\nfrom dust by placing it in a frame, and covering\nit ,vfth glass. In every successful operation,\nthe picture is almost as perfect in its details as\nthat of the camera obscura itself; but, as the\nlight of t.he sun is only white, there can be, of\npourse, none of the varied tints of natw\u00b7e. The\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fshades are supplied by- the black polish of the\nmetallic surface which, when it reflects a lumin-\nous object, the white vapour of the mercury\nappears in shade, and thus gives us either a\npositive or a negative picture, according to the\nlight in which it is viewed.\nVarious improvements have gradually been\nmade in the proceJJSeS\nof the Daguerreotype and\nthe Talbotype, which our limited space forbids us\nto describe. Mr. Beard has added colour to his\nDaguerreotype portraits, whieh is uniform and\neo transparent as not to affect the likeness in\nany degree, while the life-like effect is greatly\nheightened. M. Claudet has found that, when\nthe sun is rendered red by the vapours of the\natmosphere, it not only produces no effect upon\ntl1eDaguerreotype plate, but that it destroys the\neiFect previously produced by the white light.\nIf the image of the red sun be taken in the\ncamera obscura, it produces apon the Daguer-\nreotype plate a black image. By covering\u00b7 a\n])aguerreotype plate previously affected by light\nwith a red, orange, or yellow glass, the radiation\nthrough these coloured media has also the pro-\nperty of destroying the action produced by\n,,\u00b7hite light. The most interesting part of M\nClnudet's statement refers to the fact that, afte1\nthe destroying action of the red, orange, and\nyellow radiations, the plate is restored to itc\nformer sensitiveness; so that, after having been\naff'ect,edby wbite light, and restored by tl1c\ndestructive action of the red, orange, and yellow\ni-ndiations, it is possible to produce a 1)hotogrn-\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n102 I'BENOMENA\nOFLIGilT.\nphic effect, as upon a plate just prepared with\niodine and bromine. This alternate ncting and\ndestroying action n1ay be repeated ad infinitum,\nwithout altering the final state of the plate.\nThis curious fact proves, evidently, that, in the\nDaguerreotype process, light does not alter the\nchemical compound on the plate, and that the\naffinity for mercury is the result of some new\nproperty imparted by the action of the rays of\nlight. M. Claudet's experimenta prove, also.\nthat the red and yellow raya are endowed with\na photographic action of their own,which, aa\nwell as that of the blue and violet ray,, gives\nan affinity for mercurial vapour. The photo-\ngraphic action of the red ray is destroyed by\nthe yellow, that of the~yellow by the red; the\nred and yellow destroy the photographic action\nof the blue, and the blue destroys the action of\nthe others. 'fhe photographic, or the destroying\naction of any pa.rticular ray cannot be continued\nby any other. It appears, therefore, that each\nradiation changes the state of the plate, and\neach change produces the sensitiveness to\nmercurial vapour when it does not exist, and\ndestroys this sensitiveness ,,,hen it does exist.\u2022\nM:.Regnault has laid \u00b7before the Academy of\nSciences, at Paris, some photographic speoimens\non paper, obtained by M. Blanquart-Evrard, by\na modification of the usual process. In the\npreparations hitherto described, one part of the\n.process presented serious difficulties, namely,\nthat of the use of gallic acid in order to produce\n\u2022 LiteraryGazette.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fthe impression. It happened frequently, that a\nproof taken in too mild a light, or of too large\ndimensions, could not receive the necessary\nforce before disappearing, aa it may be said,\nunder the uniform colour prcduccd by tho\nminore of the gallic acid with the nceto-azotate\nof silver, with which the paper is imbued.\nAfter having ascertained that the gallio acid\nproduces this uniform colour on the impression,\nonly because it is combined in sn1all quantity\nwith the aceto-azotate of sih1er, M. Blanq:uart-\nEvrard removes all the difficulty. After taking\nthe proof from the camera obscura, he plunge,\nit int.o a vessel of large dimensions, covered\nwith a layer of one centim~tre of gallic acid of\ncold saturation. The bath is agitated during\nthe immersion; and the action may be thU8\nprolonged until the impression has obtained\nthe necessary force to secure a good result.\nThe proof is then washed, and the gallic acid\nis replaced by a solution of bromure of potas-\nsium, or chloruret of sodium, in which it is left\nfor about a quarter-of-an-hour.\u2022\nThe chromatype, discovered by Mr. Hwit,\nconsistsin washing good letter-paper with t.he\nfo1lowingsolution:-\nBi-chromate of potash ..\u2022 10 grains\nSulphate of copper . \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 20 graina\nDistilled water . \u2022 . . \u2022 \u2022 . 1 ounce\nPapers prepared with this are of a pale yel-\nlowcolour; they may be kept for any length of\ntime without injury, and are always ready for\n\u2022 Athemeum.\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n104 f\u00b7Jl!NOlJENA OF LIGHT.\nnse. For copying botanical specin1ens or en-\ngravings, nothing can be more beautiful. After\nthe paper has been exposed to the influence of\nsunshine, with the objects to be copied super-\nposed, it is washed over in the- dark with a\nsolution of nitrate of silver of moderate strength.\nAs soon as this is done, a very vivid po:>itive\npicture n1akes its appearance ; and all the\nfixing these pl1otographic pictures require is,\nwell washing in pure water.\nM. Niepce de St. Victor finds that, if a sheet\nof paper on which there is writing, print.ed\ncharacters, or a drawing, be exposed for a few\nn1inutes to the vapour of iodine, and there be\napplied immediately afterwards a coating of\nstarch, moistened by slightly acidulatcd water,\na faithful tracing of the writing, printing, or\ndrawing, will be obtained. M. Niepce has also\ndiscovered that a great number of substances,\nsuch as nitric acid, cl1lorurets of lime and\nmercury, act in a similar manner; and that\nvarious vapours, particularly those of ammonia,\nhave the effect of vivifying the images which\nare obtained by photography.\nIn the words of a writer in the North British\nRevieto:-\" While the nrtist is thus supplied_\nwith every materiar for his creative genius,\ntl1e public ,vill derive a new and immediate\nadvantage from the productioll.i of the solar\n\u00b7pencil.

When Labat the Jesuit visited the Peruvians,\nbe took the naked arm of one of them, and,\nconcentrating on it the rays of the sun by\nmeans of a powexful lens, soon made him\ncry out with pain, while the others looked on\nwith wonder, not unmixed with indignation.\nHow could this effect be produced ? was instantly\nthe question ; and, as prornptly, the cause was\ndeclared to be infernal.

The father-general of the Augustine\nfriars was dining with the Jesuits; and, ,vhen\nthe table was removed, he entered into a forn1al\ndiscourse of the superiority of the monastic\norder, and charged the Jesuits with assuming\nthe title of \"f1\u00b7atres,\"while they held not the\nthree vows ,vhich other monks were obliged to\nconsider sacred and binding. The general or\nthe Augustine friars ,vas very eloquent and\nvery authoritative-and the superior of the .\nJesuits was very unlearned. \u00b7\n'fhe Jesuit avoided entering the lists of con-\ntroversy with the Augustine friar, but arrested\nhis triumph by asking him if he would see one\nof his friars, who pretended to be nothing more\nthan a Jesuit, and one of the Augustine friars\nwho religiously performed the three vows; show\ninstantly ,vhich of them would be readier to\nobey his superior ?\nThe gustine friar consented. The Jesuit\n.,hen turning to one of his brothers, the friar\nMark, who was waiting upon them, said,\n\" Brother Mark, our companions are cold ; I\ncommand you, in virtue of the holy obedience\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fyou have sworn to me, to bring here, inr,antly,\nout of the kitchen-fire, and in your hands, some\nburning coals, that they may warm themselves\nover your hands.\" Father Mark mstantly\nobeyed; and, to the astonishment ofthe Augustine\nfriar, brought in his hands a supply of red\nburning coals, and held them to whoever chose\nto warm himself; and, at the command of his\nsuperior, returned them to the kitchen hearth.\nThe general of the Augustine friars, with the\nrest of his brotherhood, stood amazed; he looked\nwistfully on one of his monks, as if he wished\nto command him to do the like. But the\nAugustine monk, who perfectly understood him,\nand saw this was not a time to hesitate, ob-\nserved, \"Reverend father, forbear, and do not\ncomn1and me to tempt God : I am ready to\nfetch you fire in a chaffing-dish, but not in my\nbare hands.\" The triumph of the Jesuits was\ncomplete, and it is not necessary to add, that\n\"the miracle\"was noised about 1 and that the\nAugustine friars could never account for it,\nnotwithstanding their strict performance of the\nthree\u00b7 vows ! And yet here was no mystery.\nAccording to sir James Mackintosh, \" In the\nMercure de France, there is a very curious\naccount of experiments made at Naples to\ndiscover the means by which jugglers have\nappearedto be incombustible. They seem to\nbe completely discovered, and chiefly to consist\nin, first, gradually \u00b7habituating the skin, the\nmouth throat, and stomach, to great degrees or\nheat; ;econd, in rubbing the skin ,vith hard\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n110 ACTIONOJ'HEAT.\nsoap, and in covering the tongue with\u00b7 hard\nsoap, and over that with a layer of powdered\nsugar. By these means, tlie professor at Naples\nis enabled to walk over burning coals, to take\ninto .his mouth boiling oil, and to wash his\nhands in melted lead. The miracles or several\nsaints, the numerous escapes from the fiery\nordeal-, and tricks now played by the Hindoo\njugglers, are thus perfectly explained; and all\nthese prodigies may be performed in a fortnight\nby any apothecary's apprentice.\"\nOther instances of endurance are inerely\npretended. In country places, a con)urer some-\ntimes appears in the streets, professing that he\nIs able to eat fire ; and yet he only rolls\ntogether a ball or flax or hemp, lights it, roll\u25a0\nround it some more of the same material, slips\nit cunningly into. his mouth, and breathes\nthrough it to revive the flame; and so long\nus he inspires the air through the nostrils, and\nnot through the mouth, he suffers no injury.\nA performer, named Richardson, in the seven-\nteenth century, pretended to pour melted lead\n~pon his tongue ; but it is probable that he\nused the fusible metal formed of bismuth, tin,\nand lead, which melts at a low temperature,\nand which the writer has seeri fused on a card,\nand poured into the hand with impunity by a\nperson accustomed to handle hot substances.\nNot many years ago, a man named Chaubert\nprofessed to be incombustible; but it has been\nproved that the human body is capable of\nbearing a very high degree of heat. Men of\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\funquestionable integrity have surpassedall his\nwonders. Sir Charles Blagden exposed him .\nself in a heated room where the heat was one\nor two degrees above 260\u00b0, and remained eight\nminut,es in this situation. Eggs and a beef-\nsteak were placed on a tin framet near the\nthermometer, and in the space of twenty mi-\nnutes the eggs were roasbld quite hard, and in\nforty-seven minutes the steak was not only\ndressed, but almost .dry. Another beef-steak\nsiinilarly placed, was rather over-done in\nthirty-three minutes. Chantrey, the .celebrated\nsculptor, accompanied by five or\u00b7six friends,\nalso entered a furnace, and, after remaining\ntwo minutes, brought out a thermometer which\nstood at 320\u00b0. Some pain was experienced in\nthis experiment, but it placed beyond all\ndoubt that the human body has a remarkable\npower of enduring heat. Chaubert excited\nmuch wonder by taking phosphorus into his \u2022\nm~uth; but, as that substance, when deprived\nof air, will \u00b7not burn, he always closed his lips,\nand retired to eject the phosphonu immediately\nafterwards.\n- We tui-nnow from the resistance of heat by\nchemical means, to some striking examples ot\nits power. \u00b7\nThe name of the Giants' Causeway arose, pro-\nbably, from an idea of the supernatural power,\nentertained in times of ignorance and super-\nstition. And yet it is demonstrated that vast\nmasses of rock are to be traced to causes\n1trictly natural. Basalt is of very frequent\nDi itiz by\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n112 ACTION\nOFBEAT.\noccurrence on the surface of the globe, and is\nfrequently detected in a variety of volcanoes,\nboth extinct and active. The greatest mass of\nbasalt hitherto observed is that in the Deccan,\nwhich constitutes the surface of many thousand\nsquare miles of that part of India. In other\ninstances, it occurs in horizontal tabular masses,\nand is columnar. Sometimes, the basaltic\ncolumns are curved, and of this there is a\nbeautiful example in the island of Staffa.\nNow basalt is not a crystalline substance, for as\nit is not capable, as all crystals are, of cleavage\nin the line of its planes, or at some angle with\nthem, it is concretional. Its structure resem-\nbles an onion, or any bulbous root, for, in the\ncentre, is a solid mass, about which are others\njust like the parts of the vegetable }lroducts\nalready mentioned. These portions of basalt\nare at first of an oval form, and then they\ngradually become rudely hexagonal. \u00b7Some\nnon-columnar basalts show no trace of any\nparticular arrangement of parts, while others\nhave a globular structure, so that when the\nrock becomes much decomposed, it has the\nappearance of numerous \u00b7bomb-shells and can-\nnon-balls cemented together.\nHere, then, we have an extraordinary effect\nof heat. Mr. Gregory Watt took seven hundred\n,veight of the substance named ro\u00b7wley 1'ag,\nkept it in fusion more than six hours, and\ncooled it so gradually, that eight days elapsed\nbefore it was taken from the furnace.

Numerous\nspheroids were also formed, some being two\ninches in diameter. They were radiated with\ndistinct :fibres, the latter also forming concentric\ncoats, when circumstances were favourable to\nsuch an arrangement. When the temperature\nhad. been surliciently continuro, the centres of\nthe spheroids became compact;ed before they\nhad attained the diameter of half-an-inch.\nWhen two spheroids came \u00b7into contact, no\npenetration ensued ; but the two bodies became\nmutually compressed and separated by a plane,\nwell defined, and invested with a rusty colour.\nWhen several met, they formed prisms. In\nreasoning on th~e facts, Mr. G. Watt observes:\n\"In a stratum composed of an indefinitienumber\nin superficial extent, but only one in height,\nof impenetrable spheroids, if their peripheries\nshould come in contact in the same plane, it\nseems obvious that their mutual action _\nwould\nform thc,.m into hexagons ; and if these _were\nresisted below, and there was no opposing cause\nabove them, it seems equally clear that they\nwould extend their dimensions up,vards, and\nthus form hexagonal prisms, whose length\nmight be indefinitely greater than their dia-\nmeters.\".\nDi itiz y\nThat the great power in operation in the\nformation of basaltic columns is heat, appears\nto be indisputable. There \u2022, for example, a\nbed of sandstone in furnaces for smelting\ng a.1 glrial 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f114: ACTIONOF BEI.T.\nmetals, and, in tho course of time, it requires\nto be repaired. Portions, taken out, on such\noccasions, have been found to have a columnar\nappearance : the heat of the furnace having\nchanged the form of the substance, not by any\nfusion of its partB, but by a peculiar arrange-\nment of them, thus giving them the specified\nfigure.\nAnother astonishing result of this natural\npower is seen in the eruption of a volcano.\n'fhe eye of a traveller, perhaps, as it is turned\ntowards Vesuvius, discerns a dark red spot on\nthe mountain's side, issuing from an orifice near\nto the crater. But soon, that deep burning\nlight apparently spreads out, or flows on into a\nlong wide stream, descends the entire length of\nthe great cone, and reaches to the plain below.\nBut, as the :first light was seen through and\nbehind the mists which follow the departure of\nthe sun, so now its extended influence is only\nrendered visible by the increasing gloom.

It\nis said that the inventor observed that the smoke\nhovering over a burning mountain diminished\nits fury, and that, on analysing it and combining\nsimilar elements, he discovered the means of\nextinguishing fires, and thus of arresting at the\noutset what might otherwise prove a tremendous\ncalamity. \u00b7\nMany processesof art, like the operations of\nnature, are dependent on heat.

The baron Von\nTchivanhausen constructed a burning mirror\nin 1687, :fivefeet three inches in breadth, and\nreflecting the solar rays with extrao:rdinary\npower. When exposed to its force, wood took\nfire, and continued to burn, notwithstanding a\nmost violent wind ; and water, contained in an\nearthen vessel, quickly boiled, so that. eggs\nwere cooked, and the liquid soon after evapo-\nrated.

In one case, the heat of the\nflame of oxide of carbon and oxygen had been\nused; in another, the oxyhydrogen flame; and,\nin the third, the galvanic arc of :flamefrom a\nBunsen battery of one hundred pairs.

Sievier.\nThe general principle is this :-Pieces of caout-\nchouc, mixed, as they are in their native state,\nwith various impurities, are put into a strong\nmetallic drum, through which passes an axle,\nstudded with chisel-shaped teeth. The interior\nof the drum is supplied with similar ones, but\nstationary. Therefore, when the axle is made\nto revolve, the caoutchouc becomes subjected\nto a most powerful rending and kneading mo-\ntion, in the course of which sufficient heat is\nevolved, notwithstanding a current of cold\nwater continually passes through the drum,\nto agglutinate the material into a compact\nmass.

The process has also\nbeen successfully tested for drying loaf-sugar,\ndrying printing-paper, or setting the ink, to\nenable books to be bound more quickly than\nusual; drying starch, and converting it into\ndextine, or British gum; and preserving meat.\nIt has been also stated, that sixty suits of\nclothes, which had belonged to persons who\nhad died of the plague in Syria, had been sub-\nject to the process of purification, at a tem-\nperature of about 240\u00b0, and afterwards worn\nby sixty persons ; not one of whom ever gave\nthe slightest sympton1 of being affected by the\nmalady. In describing these processes, the\nwriter referred to the mode adopted by the\nNorth American Indians for preserving the meat\nof the buffalo-that of drying it in the sun ;\nand sta,ted (hat heated currents had been ap-\nplied successfully. The discovery seems highly\nimportant for shipping; ns, instead of sailors\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n122 ACTION OF J.lEAT.\nconsuming salted provisions from one month's\nend to another, they might thus have an occa-\nsional supply of fresh meat. Meat treated in\nthis way occupies much less space, too, and is\nmuch lighter in weight. It is believed that the\njuices of the meat contain about seven-eighths\nof watery moisture : this, the current of heated\nair removes, leaving the albumen and all the\nflavour and n~trition behind. \u00b7\nThat in the production of steam heat is of\nincalculable value, there needs no proof.

Addressing the specta-\ntors, he was accustomed to ask for a nmne to be\ngiven him, and it ,vas correctly spelt by the\nswan, as it moved fron1 one letter to another\ntill it had indicated the whole. A little philo-\nsophy, in this instance, produced repeatedly\ngreat astonishment. A magnetic bar ,vas placed\nin the s,van, and the performer had a powerful\nn1agnet concealed in his own dress, and the\nswan, of course, follo,ved his motions. Thus,\nif he wanted the swan to spell \" Selina,\" lie\nmoved first to S, then to E, and so on, through\nthe successive letters of that name, till the \u00b7word\n,vas spelt. On one occasion, ho,vever, the per-\nformer was not a little disconcerted-the swan\nstopped in its course and refused to move.\nAgain and again the effort was n1ade, but it\nwas utterly in vain; the n1,\nngician could only\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fOXlDE or IUON. 125\nacknowledge that some person was in the room\naware of his secret, and count.erncting his\nmovements. Sir Francis Blake Delaval avowed\nhimself to be the person: he produced a magnet\nwhich he had used on facing the performer as\nhe stood at the table; the swan was, therefore,\nplaced between two attractive instruments, and,\nof course, remained immovable. .\nA magnet may be described as a piece of\niron, which possesses the property of turning\ntowards the poles of the earth. This extra-\nordinary quality does not necessarily belong to\nall specitnens of iron in its native state, but\nonly to one kind or variety called the oxide, on\naccount of its union with oxygen in a particular\ncondition. The possession of n special quality\nin this ore of iron was not discovered from its\npolarity, or power of turning to_\nthe poles of the\nearth, but fron1 its property of attracting small\npieces. of iron, ,vhich are not magnetic; and\nhence it was called the loadstone.\n'!'here are many uses to ,vhich the magnet\n.has been applied, and there is a probability of\nits being much more extcnsi vely employed; but\nits most important application is in the con-\n9truction of the mariners' co1npass, which ren-\nders it possible freely tQ traverse the ocean.\nThere has been some controversy as to the\ndiscovery of the directive power of the magnet,\nand the invention of the compass. It was once\nsupposed to have been unknown until about the\nthirteenth century, but it is now generally\nacknowledged tliat the Chinese were acquainted\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n126 MAGNETISM.\nwith the compass at least eleven hundred and\nfourteen years before the birth of Christ. At\nthe commencement of the thirteenth century, it\nwas certainly in use in Europe; for cardinal de\nVitty mentions it with some particularity, in a\nwork entitled \"The History of the East,\" where\nhe says, \" The iron needle, after contact with\nthe loadstone, constantly turns t.o the north\nstar, which, as the \u2022axis of the firmament,. re-\n3lains immovable, while \u00b7the others revolve;\nand hence it is essentially nece,sary to those\nnavigating on the ocean.\" This shows that\nthe compass was not invented in Europe, as\ncommonly believed, by Gioia, a pilot, and a\nnative of Pasitano, a small village, situated near\nAmalfi, who lived about the end of the thir-\nteenth century, but, by him, it appears to have\nbeen made fully available for the purposes of\nnavigation.\nAs used by sailors in the Mediterranean at\nthat period, it was a very uncertain guide; for\nthe compass then consisted of a magnetic needle\nattached to two straws on a piece of cork,\nfloating onwater in a basin, or glass vase. Gioia,\ntherefore, placed the magnetic needle upon a\npivot, so that it was free to move in any dire<>-\ntion, and thus prevented that inconvenience and\ninaccuracy of observation which must have\nresulted from the motion of the needle floating\non :water, agitated by the tossing of the vessel.\nThe magnetic needle was afterwards attached to\na card divided into thirty-two points, called the\nrosedu t,ents, so that the dirootion in whicha\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fIRONMAGNETIZED. 127\nvessel was sailing could be minutely determined,\nand the means of ascertaining it was no longer\ndependent on the accuracy of the eye in mea-\nwring distances. The mariners' compass is\nstill constructed in the same manner, but is\ninclosed in a box with a glass cover, and is\nthus preserved from the influence of the wind.\nAnother improv.ement has been made in so\nsuspending the box that, however the vessel\nmay be pitched by the wavee, and rolled from\nside to side, the needle remains in a horizontal\nposition, and gives accurate indications of the\ndirection in which the vessel is e~iling.\nIn addition to the properties already men-\ntioned, the loadstone has the power of oommu..\nnicatiug its virtues to any piece of hard iron or\nsteel, and that, without diminution of strength ;\nso that, if but one piece had been discovered, it\nwould have been sufficient for the production\n,of all the magnets that have ever been formed\nby man. Other means may be adopted of\naccomplishing this purpose. Take a bar of\niron, and, striking it several times with a\nhammer, it will become n1agnetic. This ex-\nperiment may be performed with a common\npok\u00b7er. The magnetism thus communicated to a\nsteel bar will be much increased in power, if it\nbe supported on another bar during the process\n\u2022ofhammering. -\nGay Lussac, a French chemist of great\ncelebrity, discovered a method of making mag-\nnets by a process so simple, that it may, in all\ncases,be applied successfully. Take a piece of\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nthin iron wire and suspend it in a vertical\nposition. The earth itself being a magnet,\ninduces a magnetic power in the wire. To\nrender this permanent, twist the ,vire till it\nbreaks, and a n1agnet will be obtained.\nMrs. Somerville, well known for her e..~cellent\n}lhilosophical works, made some experiments\non the effect of solar light in the production of\npermanent magnetism. If half of a small\nsewing needle le covered with paper, and the\nexposed part be placed in the violet or indigo\nray, magnetis1n will be induced, and the same\neffect will be producedin a smaller degree by\nthe blue and green. e -( \/\n. To describe but one more mode ; magnets\nare readily made by what is called the single\ntouch, and this is perhaps the mo$t simple and\nmvst effective way of proceeding. Place tht\nsteel bar to be n1agnct.izedoria table, or any other\nconvenient place, and, as nearly as possible,\nnorth and south, which position is callei! by\nphilosophers, the magnetic meridian. This\nbeing done, draw over it perpendicularly a\n.strong magnet. In this operation, it is neces-\nsary to begin at one end of the bar, and draw\nthe magnet over its entire length, and then\nagain in the same direction. It must not be\ndrawn backward and forward, for the power\ncommunicated in one direction, \"\"ould be de-\nstroyed by an opposite motion.\nThe following experin1ents are very instruct-\nive :-Suspend a magnetic needle bya silk cord,\nso that it will hang in a horizontal position.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDIFroSION OT KAQNETISY. l !9\nThen bring it over the centre of a large\nn1agnet lying _upon a table, and it will still\nretain its position ; but, as it is brought near\nto eitlier end, it will be bent downwards, and,\nat the extremities, will be vertical. This ex-\nperiment illustrates what is called the dip or\n~he magnet .. On the equator of the earth, the\nneedle is horizo~tal, or nearly so, but as it is\nbrought near the poles it dips, and over either\nmagnetic pole would be vertical. The reason\nof this is evident from the former experiment :\nat the equator, each pole of the needle is\nattracted in an equal degree by the north and\nsouth poles of the\u00b7 earth ; but, if we proceed\nnorthward, the north pole\u00b7of the magnet will\nbe more attracted than the south, and point\ntowards it until at last it becomes verticaJ \u2022\nThe poles of the earth's rotation, that is, tl-\n..\ne\npoints which would form the terminations of\nits axis, did it revolve on one, are no_tthe\nmagnetic poles; nor is the equator of the earth\nthe magnetic equator. They do not, however,\ngreatly vary.\n,Take, also, a bar magnet,and, placing it upon\na table, cover it with a sheet of writing-paper.\nThen sprinkle upon it some fine iron filings,\n~d they will arrange themselves in very\nbeautiful curves round the magnet, showing, as\n, it is supposed, the circulation of the magnetic\nfluid. :From this experiment, we learn that the\nmagnetic power is greatest at the poles; and\nthis .is true in reference to the magnetism of\nthe\u00b7 earth, ,v\nhich increases in power from the\nDi itiz by\ng\nB\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n130 MAGNETISM.\nmagnetic equator to the magnetic poles of the\nearth, as determined by a great variety of inte-\nresting and delicate experimentB. Sir Graves\nC. Haughton has communicated a paper to the\nJune number of Brewster's Philosophical\nMagazine, entitled \"Experiments proving the\ncommon nature of Magnetism, Cohesion, Ad-\nhesion, and Viscosity.\"\nThis paper contains two separate sets of\nexperiments, the first of which relates to the\nattraction the magnetic needle has for various\nmineral, vegetable, and animal substances : and\nit is not a little remarkable that antimony and\nbismuth, as well as copper, tin, and cadmium,\nare, in these experiments, shown to have attract-\nive powers for the magnetic needle; though,\nin those made by Dr. Faraday, he has ranged\nthem amongst the class of dia-magnetics, that\nis, of those that exhibited repulsion. Arsenic,\ntoo, which he found so intractable, was made,\nin the present experiments, to assume the real\nmagnetic character,, that is to say,the power of\nattracting and repelling, by being kept for a\nshort time in contact with a bar magnet.\nIodine, likewise, \u00b7wasfound, on bringing it near\ntl1e needle, to be able to attract it.\nIn most of these experiments, the needle was\n~~1ade\nto attach itself to the substances by being\nf:)rced towards them by a magnet., which was\ngent1y withdrawn after contact was so effected.\n1n this way, and by a reference to the degrees\nr.;,f the compass traversed by the needle, a hair\n;,f the head, or a sp~rk of diamond, can be\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fl>tFJUSlONo, lll<IMETISK. -18l\nICCUTatel:,meamred. The strength of the\nneedle in its movement on a pivot was ascer-\ntained by azimuthtt, of which a detailed account\nia given.\nThe remainder of the memoir, which is con\ntaineclin a supplementary number of the Maga-\nzine, ia devoted to a detail of about five hundred\nexperimente, in which non-ferruginous needles\nwere made, by a modification of the magnetic\nneedle, or which they formed a portion, to\nattach themselves to the same substances as in\nthe preceding experiments. Th us, for instance,\nneedles of most of the ;remarkable metals, as\nwell as of glass, were found to have a strong\naffinity for nearly every kind of substance,\nwhether mineral, vegetable, or animal, if its\ndensity was greater than that of cork or char-\ncoal. Brass surpassed all the metals in its\npower of attraction, an<f,what is most remark-\nable, the magnetic needle was the lowest of all\n~ the scale, showing not much more than one-\nthird of the attractive energy of so~ iron.\nEvery substance of a crystalline or vitreous\ncharacter exhibited remarkable magnetic pro-\nperties, and this could not be mistaken, as it\nmight be heightened at pleasure by contact\nwith either pole of a powerful magnet.

They were joined by means of the wir~\nof the telegraph, in such a manner as that, by a\ncurrent of electricity, the machinery of the\nclock in Glasgo,v was made to move correctly,\naccording to the vibrations of the electrical\npendulum in Edinburgh. \u00b7 Thus, in like man~\nner,w~reEngland and Scotland united in one\ngreat chronometrical alliance, a single elec-\ntrical pendulum of this description, placed in\nthe Observatory at Greenwich, would give the\nastronomical time correctly throughout the\ncountry.\nThe electric telegraph may be said to havf\noriginated in a trivial incident. It occurred to\nprofesspr Oersted, of Copenhagen, to try the\neffect of a galvanic current on the needle of the\n~omp8$s. He found it, on making the experi-\nment, deflected, that is, turned aside from its\nusual bearing of due north and south. Pro-\nfessor ,vheatstone applied this result very in--\ngeniously.

The wires, which are suspended through\nthe length of the line, are attached at either\nend to the telegraphic instruments, a branch\n,vire being fastened to a large metallic surface,\nimbedded in the earth for completing the elec-\ntric current. When at rest, the handles are\ndown, and the pointers remain in their vertical\nposition. The signals are given by two mag-\nnetic needles, or pointers, each suspended ver-\ntically on an axis passing through the dial, and,\nbehind, another pointer is fixed on each cor-\nresponping axis. \u00b7 A portion o( the conducting\n,vire, many yards in length, is coiled round the\ngalvanometer frame, in w!iich the magnet\nn1oves,so as to subject the magnet to the multi-\nplied deflecting force of the electric current.\nThe battery is the motive power of the ma-\nchine, occupying the same relative position to\nit, as the boiler does to the locomotive; for,\nthough it does not produce any immediate\nt'eSulton the works, yet the part it performs in\nthe undertaking is essential.

If the\nreceiver understands the wora, he signifies it by\nmoving the same pointer twice to the left, and\ntwice .to the right, which n1eans yes; if the\ncommunication is not understood, then the\nneedle points twice to the right, and twice to the\n.left, which indicates no.

Never,\np~rhaps, was a stratagem acted more infamous\nthan one in Berne, in the year 1500, the follow-\ning acoo11ntof which drawn from Ruchet's\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n\"Histoire de Ja R~formntion en Suisse,\" and\nHottinger's \"Hist. Eccles. Hch1\net.,\" is given in\nMosheim's \"Eccles. Hist.\" A similar account\nn1ay be found in bishop Barnet's Travels\nthrough France, Italy, etc. The stratagem in\nquestion was the consequence of a rivalship\nbetween the Franciscans and Dominicans, and\nmore especially of their controversy concerning\nthe immaculate conception of the virgin Mary.\nThe former maintained, that she was born\nwithout. the blemish of original sin ; the latter\nasserted the contrary. The doctiine of the\nFranciscans, in an age of darkness and super-\nstition, could not but be popular; and hence,\nthe Dominicans lost ground from day to day.\nTo support the credit of their order, they re-\nsolved, at a chapter held at Vimpsen in the\nyear 1504, to have recourse to fictitious visions\nand dreams, in ,vhich the people at that time\nhad an easy faith; and they determined to\nmake Berne the scene of their operation.a. A\nperson named Jetzer, who was extremely sim-\nple, and much inclined to austerities, and who\nhad taken their habit as a lay-brother, was\nchosen as the instrument of the delusions they\nwere contriving. One of the four Dominicans,\nwho had undertaken the management of this\nplot, conveyed himself secretly into Jetzer's\nce11;and, about miqnight, appeared to him in a\nhorrid figure, surrounded with howling dogs,\nand seen1ed to blow fire from his nostrils, by\nthe means of a box of combustibles which he\nheld near his mouth. f.n thia frightful form, he\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nTHEFIWrolSCAKSANDDOlllNICANS. 1~7\napproached Jetzer's bed, told him that he was\nthe ghost of a Dominican, who had been killed\nat Paris, as a judgment from heaven for laying\naside his monastic habit ; that he was con-\nd_emned to purgatory for this crime; adding,\nthat, by his means, he might be rescued from\nhis misery, which was beyond expression.\nThis story, accompanied with horrible cries\nand howlings, frightened poor Jetzer out of\nthe little wits he had, and engaged him to\npromise to do all in his power to deliver the\nDominican from his torment. Upon this, the\nimpostor told him, that nothing but the most\nextraordinary mortifications, such as the disci-\npline of the whip, performed during eight days\nby the whole monastery, and Jetzer's lying\nprostrate, in the form of one crucified, in the\nchapel, during n1ass, could contribute to his\ndeliverance. He added, that the performance\nof these mortifications would draw down upon\nJetzer the peculiar protection of the blessed\nvirgin ; and concluded by saying that he\nshould appear to him again, accompanied with\ntwo other spirits.\n1\"Iorningwas no s~oner come, than Jetzer\ngave an account of this apparition to the rest\nof the convent, who all unanimously advised\nhim to undergo the discipline that was enjoined ;\nand every one consented to endure his share\nof the task imposed. The deluded simpleton\nobeyed, and was admired as a saint by the\n1nnititnde that crowded about the convent,\nwLile~the four friars, that managed the impos-\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f158 PRETIKDKD\nMllUOLU.\nture, magnified, in the most pompom manner,\nthe miracle of this apparition, in t.heir sermons,\nand in their discourse. The night after, the\napparition waa .renewed, with the addition of\ntwo impostors, dressed like devils; and Jetzer's\nfaith was augmented by hearing from the\nspectre all the secrets of his life and thoughts,\nwhich the impostors had learned from his\nconfessor. In this, and some subsequent\n. scenes, (the detail of whose enormities we shall\nhere omit,) the impostor talked much to Jetzer\nof the Don1inican order, which ha said wns\npeculiar Iy dear to the blessed virgin : he added,\nthat the virgin knew herself to he conceived in\noriginal sin; that the doctors who taught the\ncontrary were in purgatory; that the blessed\nvirgin abhorred the Franciscans for making\nher equal with her Son ; and that the town of\nBerne would be destroyed for harbouring such\nplagues within her walls. In one of these\napparitions, Jetzer imagined that the voice of\nthe spectre resen1bled that of the prior of the\nconvent, and he was not mistaken ; hut, not\nsuspecting a fraud, he gave little\u00b7 attention to\nthis. The prior appeared in varioua forms,\nsometimes in that of St. Barbara, at others, in\nthat of St. Bernard; at length, he assumed\nthat of the virgin Mary; and, for that purpoSEs\nclothed himself in the habits that were em-\nployed to adorn the statue of the virgin in the\ngreat festivals ; the little images, that on th~se\ndays are placed on the altars, were made use o(\nfor angels, which, being tied to a cord that\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fTHE .FRANCISCANS\nAMDDOHINICANS. 159\npassed through a pulley over Jetzer's head,\nrose up and down, and danced about the\npretended virgin to increas~ the delusion. The\nvirgin thus equipped, ad~ressed a long dis-:-\ncourse to Jetzer, in which, among other. things,\nshe told him that she was conceiveil in originaJ\nsin, though she had remained but a short titne\nunder that blemish. \u00b7She gave him, as a. mi-\nraculous proof of her presence, a host, or\nconsecrated wafer, which turned from white to\nred in a moment : and, airer various visits, in\nwhich the greatest enormities were transacted,\nthe virgin-prior told Jetzer, that she would\ngive him the most affecting and undoubted\nmarks of her Son's love, by iinprinting on him\nthe five wounds that pierced Jesus 01;1t\u00b5e cross,\nas she had done hefore to St. Lucia and St.\nCatharine. Accordingly, she took .his hand\nby force, and struck a large nail through it,\nwhich threw the poor dupe into the greatest\ntorment.\nThe next night, this masculine virgin\nbrought, as he pretended, some of th~ linen\nin which Christ had been buried, to soften th~\nwound, and gave Jetzer a soporific draught,\nwhich had in it the blood of an unbaptized\nchild, eome grains of incense, and of conse-\ncrated salt, some quicksilver, and the hairs of\nthe eye-brows of a child, all of which, with\nsome stupifying and poisonous ingredients,\nwere mingled together by the prior with magic\nceremonies, and a sole1nn dedication of himself\nto the devil in the hope oi his succour.

When\nhe awoke, he found, to his unspeakable joy,\nthese iinpressions \u2022 on his body, and came at\nlast to fancy himself a representative of Christ\nin the various parts of his passion. He was,\n1n this state, exposed to the admiring multi-\ntude on the principal altar of the convent, to\nthe great mortification of the Franciscans.\nThe Dominicans gave him some other draughts,\n\u00b7that thre,v him into convulsions, which were\nfollowed by a voice conveyed through a pi~\ninto the mouths of two. images, one of Mary,\nand another of the child Jesus ; the fonner\nof which had tears painted upon its cheeks in\na lively manner. The little Jesus asked his\nmother, by means of t.his voice, (which was\nthat of the prior,) why she ,vept? and she\nanswered, that her tears ,vere owing to the\nimpious manner in which the Franciscans\nattributed to her the honour that was due to\nhim, in saying that she was conceived and\nborn without sin.\nThe apparitions, false prodigies, nnd abomi-\nnable stratagems \u2022 of th~se Dominicans were\nrepeated every night; and the matter was at\nlength so grossly over-acted, that, simple as\nJetzer ,vas, he at last discovered it, and had\nalmost killed the prior, who appeared to him\none night in tl1e form of the virgin, with a\ncrown on her head. The Dominicans, fearing,\ng a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fTHE JfKA.NUUKiUUS A.ND .DOMlfflCAM:t. J.0.l\nby this discovery, to lose the fruits of their\nimposture, thought the best method would be 1iO\nown the whole matter .t,o Jetzer, and to engage\nhim, by the most seducing promises of opulence\n\u2022 \u00b7\n,i)r i glory, to carry on the cheat. Jetzer was\n_. ~ersuaded, or at least he appeared to be so.\nThe Dominicans, however, suspecting that he\nwas not entirely gained over, resolved to poison\nhim ; but his constitution was so vigorous\nthat, though they gave him poison five several\n. times; he was not destroyed by it. One\nday, they sent him a loaf prepared with some\nspices, wnich, growing green in a day or two,\nhe threw a piece of it to a wolf's whelps, that .\nwere in the monastery, and it kille<l them\nimmediately. At another time, they poisoned\nthe host, or consecrated wafer, but he escaped\nonce more. In short, there were no means of\nsecuring him, which the most detestable im-\npiety and barbarity could invent, that they did\nnot put in practice; till, finding at last an oppor-\ntunity of getting out of the convent, he threw\nhimself into the hands of the magistraties, to\nwhom he made a full discovery of this infernal\nplot. The affair being brought to Rome, com-\nmissaries were sent from thence to examine the\nmatter; and the wholecheat being fully proved,\nthe four friars were solemnly degraded from\ntheir priesthood, and were burned alive, on the\nlast day of May, 1509. Jetzer died some time\nafter at Constance, having poisoned \u00b7himself,\nas was believed by some.

His, holiness, on this occasion,\u00b7 pre\naented him with a precious box of relic,. Tht\nprince having returned home, some monks in\ntreat;ed permission to try the eifect of thest.\nrelics on a demoniac, who had hitherto re\nsilted eyery kind of exorcism. They we1e\nbrought into the church with solemn pomp,\nand deposited on the altar, accompanied by an\ninnumerable crowd. After the usual conjura...\ntions, which were unsuccessful, they applied\nthe relics. The demoniae instantly recovered.\nThe people called out, ''- A miracle P' and the\nprince, lifting his hands and eyes to heaven,\nfelt, it is said, his faith confirmed. In this\ntransport of joy, he -observed that a young\ngentleman, who was keeper of this treasure of\nrelics, smiled, and by his motions ridiculed the\nmiracle. The prince indignantly took the\nyoung keeper of the relics to task ; who, on the\nPJ9omise of pardon, gave the following secret\nintelligence concerning them. In travelling\nfrom Rome he had lost the box ofrelics, and,\nnot daring to mention it, he obtained a similar\none, which he had filled with small bones of\ndogs and cats, and other trifles similar to what\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f.

He hoped he might be forgiven for\nsmiling, when he found such a collection of\nrubbish was idolized with such pomp, and had\neven the virtue of expelling demons ! It was\nby the assistance of this box that the prince\ndiscovered the gross impositions of the monks\nand demoniacs, and Radzviil afterwards becaroe\na zealous Lutheran.\u2022\nTo take another case, for which we are in-\ndebted to Scott's \" History of the Lives of Pro-\ntestant Reformers in Scotland.\" At the east end\nof the -village of Musselburgh there was a\nchapel dedicated to the virgin Mary;its proper\nname being Loretta, though it was vulgarly\ncalled Alareit, or Lawreit. There was also a\nchapel of the same name in Perth, and many\ncredulous people of both these places, as well\nas the people of Loretta, in Italy, believed that\ntheir chapel contained within it the identical\nsmall brick-built house in which Mary had\ndwelt at Nazareth, and that it had been con-\nveyed miraculously from its original seat. At\nthe time now reft~rred to, it was announced in\nEdinburgh, and the neighbouring places, that a\nmiracle would be performed on a certain day,\nand a great number of persons consequently\n.l8sembled. A stage was erected on the out-\nside of the chapel, and, at length, a young man,\napparently blind, was led forward. Many of\nthose who were present knew this person, and\nhad, perhaps, often pitied his circumstances.\nAfter various prayers and ceremonies, his eyes,\n\u2022 ~Iaraeli'\u2022 \"Curiosities,'~ p. 87.\nF2\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f.....\nDi itiz by\n164: PRETENDED\nMIRACLES.\nto the satisfaction of the people, appeared. to be\nperfectly restored. Returning thanks to the\npriests and friars, he now left the stage, and\nreceived the congratulations of the people, some\nof whom gave hitn money.\n. The true character of the treatment of his\ncase will appear from the following narrative.\nHe had been a poor friendless boy, who had\nattended the sheep belonging to the ruins ot\nScienna, or Sciennes, about a quarter of a mile\nfrom Edinburgh. It was one of his amuse-\nments to turn up the whites of his eyes ; and,\nso effectually did he do this, as to appear, at\npleasure, perfectly blind. The nuns spoke of\nhim to some priests and friars, and they ]aid\nthe plan which was afterwards carried out.\nThe child was secreted for some years from\npublic view, and, when it was supposed he was\n\u2022 s\u00b0'altered as not to be recognised, he was sent\nforth a blind mendicant, \u00b7accompanied by a\nperson who believed he was born so, and had\npreviously been supported by the nuns. Bound\nby a solemn but rash vow to affect blindness,\nhe travelled the country for a considerable\ntime, till at length the trick of his restoration\nwas played as has already been stated.\nAmong the numerous publications of M.\nGuizot, is an edition of the \" Chronicles ot\nFrodvard,'' which, in addition to much historical\nmatter, ascribes many miracles to the bishops or\nRheims. One of them, bishop Remi, it is said,\n\"was in the house of a wealthy female relative,\nconversing with her on religious topics, when her\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fTHE MADONNA.. 165\nbutler announced that there was no ~ore wine in\nthe cellars. The bishop, seeing her embarrass-\nment, having previously entered some of the\nlower apartments himself, proposed to accom-\npany her to the cellar. When they entered it,\nhe inquired whether there was not a little win~\nremaining in a particular cask. The butler\nreplied, that there was only enough to preserve\nit from \u00b7decay. The bishop then desired him\nto sh~t the \u00b7door, and not to stir from his posi-\ntion, and passing to the other end to the cask,\nwhich was pretty large,\u00b7 he made the sign or\nthe cross and prayed. Soon the wine rose up\nout of the cask, and flooded\u00b7over the cellar-\nfioor !\" Now, the fact of the bishop's visit to\nthe cellar first ; of a butler, it might be, not\nvery acute in \u00b7vision, being desired, after lock-\ning the door, to exclude all witnesses, and to\nstand at a distance; and, of a relation of the\nbishop, who might easily. be made a con-\nfederate, being engaged; is surely more than\nsufficient to set aside the whole tale. Moreover,\nthe lady gave, as the result of the prodigy,\nwhich many a conjuror has easily surpassed, a\nportion of her estate in perpetuity to the bishop\nand his church ! Prodigies pf the Romish\nchurch in abundance have had precisely the\nsame issue. '\nIn an official and authorized Roman\nCatholic publication, printed in 1881, we are\ntold that not less than twenty-six pictures \u00b7or \u00b7\nthe virgin Mary opened and shut their eyes at\nRome ~uring the years 1796 and 1797, which\n\u2022\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n166 PUETENDED IDRAOLES.\nwas supposed to be an indication of her \u00b7pe~\nculiar favour to the inhabitants of that city for\nthe opposition which they presented to the\nFrench.

At length one,\nmore acute than the rest, observed that some\nwater was passing through the roof of the\nthurch, and dripping upon the canvas, pointed\nout the circumstance; but he nearly fell a\nvictim to his want of j udgment, for the people\nwere determined to have a miracle ; nor could\nthey be persuaded to disperse till the arch-\nbishop, a venerable old man, mounted a ladder,\nand wiped the lady's eyes with a napkin ; afte1\nthis, he drew the picture into a oore perpen-\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fAIJSBBTBD\nIXOILOIBV. 167\ndicular situation, teJUng his audience, that, u\nthe cause was luckily removed, their patro,ae,,\nhad promised to weep u.omore.\"\u2022\nThe author of \" Rome in the N9meteenth\nCentury\" aays: \"Privat,e miracles affecting\nindividuals go on quite commonly every day\nwit.bout exciting the smallest attention.

The so-called miracle was blazed\nforth far and wide, and an engraved repre-\nsent.ation of the appearance was widely distri-\nbuted. Nor was this all: it was said that the\nvirgin sat on a stone during the interview,\nand that, on this being broken, after she was\ngone, there was found in the interior an image\nof our Lord ! But what are the facts that have\nbeen discovered since? That the priests em-\nployed a lady to personate the virgin; and\nthat the figure in the stone was traced by a\nFrench officer, who, with a companion, placed\nit on that .spot for a joke; as, in Italy, objects\nof modern manufacture are buried, and then\ndug up, to be passed oif on the unwary as\nreally antique! In such instances, however,\nmoney is frequently made; while the French\nofficers had no mercenary inten~ns.\n\u00b7 We close these exposures with a pretended\nmiracle of the Greek church. At the church\nof the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, there is\nannually a ceremony to which multitudes are\nattracted. It is pretended by the Greek\npriests, that, on a particular day, u sacred fire\nJ>roceeds fron1 the sepulchre : the pilgrims,\ntherefore: congregated at Je11.1salem,\nattend\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fTHE GREll :rmE. 118\nthere to light theirs; these are then extin-\nguished, and carefully preserved, to be added\nto the garment dipped in the Jordan when\nthey are buried. All, however, await the\narrival of the Turkish governor; for, \" till he\naITives, the miracle is not certainly to take\nplace.\"\nTo quote from some travellers who were\npresent at the ceremony, during the year 1846,\nwe are informed that \" it was a very remark-\nable scene. The large area of the church was\ndensely crowded; but, around the sepulchre, a\nspace of about four feet wide was kept clear by\na double line of Turkish soldiers. At short\nintervals_of time, a number of infatuated and\nhighly-excite<l men and boys entered in, and,\nrushed round and round with desperate energy,\nscreaming and hallooing like so many maniacs.\nSome stood upright on a friend's shoulders,\nwho ran with the rest till an unlucky stumble\nthrew both to the ground. One old man was\nparticularly conspicuous; he generally headed\nthe rest, and seemed to be fitter for a strait-\nwaistcoat than to be the leader of a religious\nprocession. He ~ced, shouted, and threw\nhimself intoall sorts of postures. At last he\nmounted 9n another frantic devotee, and urged\nhim to his utmost speed: they continued their\nmad course till he was thrown down violently\nagainst two of the soldiers ; they seized him by\nthe hair of his head, and hauled him out of the\nchurch.

It was, for the\ntime, like Bedlam let loose: some were kneeling\nin 8Cltatic adorat.iont others screaming, dancing,\nand jumping; the more zealous put the flame\ninto their mouths, or applied it to their faces or\nnaked breasts. It is asserted that the holy fire\ndoes not burn or hurt any one, but Mr. Dalton\nnoticed that few kept it long enough near to\ngife it a fair trial.

As the grant of Divine\nrevelation was made to some persons who were\nto proclaim it to the whole human race, so,\nwhile holy men of God spake as they were\nmoved by the Holy Ghcst, the broad seal of\nHeaven was placed by miracles on their testi-\nmony. As a man's signature gives validity to\nhis bond, or tl1e credentials of an ambassador\ndemonstrate his right to transact the business ot\nhis sovereign ; so the supernatural works per-\nformed by \u00b7the prophets, by our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and by his apostles, prove as fully to\nthose who witnessed them, that the words they\nheard proceeded from God, as if they had\nlistened to him pronouncing them with an\naudible voice from the excellent glory; while\najl to whom their testimony has been faithfully\ntran.smitted, may cherish an equal confidence\n8\nOr1QI\nrial 'rbm\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n178 lllRACLES.\nIt has been well remarked by archbishop\nTillotson, that \"there are two things necessary .\nin a miracle: that there should be a supernatural\neffect, and that this effect should be evident to\nsense.\" He adds, \"Neither in Scripture, nor\nin profane authors, nor in common use, is any-\nthing called a mi~acle but what falls under the\ncognizance of the senses; a miracle being\nnothing else but a su~atural effect evident to\nsense, t~e great end and design whereof is to be\nthe sensible proof and conviction of something\nthat we do not see.\" The church of Rome\naffirms that, in the celebration of the mass, the\nbread and wine are changed into the very body\nand blood, soul and Divinity, of our Lord Jesus\nChrist; though they retain exactly the same\nappearance that they had before the change is\nsaid to have occurred. Hence, the same writer\nargues, \" For want of a supernatural effect\nevident to sense, transubstantiation is no mira-\ncle ; a sign or a miracle is always a thing\nsensible, otherwise it could be no sign. Now-;\nthat such a change in tran~ubstantiation should\nreally be wrought, ::indyet that th~re 8honld\nbe no sign of it, is a thing very wonderful; but\nnot to sense, for our senses percei~e no change\u2022\n.Andthat a thing should remain to all appearance\njust as it was, hath nothing at all wonderful in.\nit. We wonder, indeed, when we see a strange\nthin~ done, but no man.wonders when he sees\nnothing done.\"\nNumberless were the tniracles wrought by\nJehovah in ancient times, in behalf of his chosen\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fMIRACLES IN THE WILDERNESS. 179\npeopl~. In\u00b7 vain does infidelity object that the\ncontentf3 of the books of Moses may not be true;\nsince, had they been false, it was absolutely\nimpossible tl_iat ~1ey could have obtained any\ncredit. The number of the people must have\nAmounted to three millions, and every adult\nperson was a competent judge whether the\nthings related to ha~e taken place within his\nown memory had really happened.\nThe Israelites would not have believed that\nthe Re~ Sea was divided to give them a pass\u2022\nage---that, during their pilgrimage of forty\nyears in the 'Wilderness, a miraculous cloud hacl\nguided them by day, and become n.t night a\nfire casting round its radiance-that they hu.d\nbeen supplied with manna from heaven, falling\non six successive days around their ca.mp,and on\nthe last of them a double quantity, to prevent its\n\u00b7being gathered on the sabbath-that God had\npublished his law on the mount that might not\nbe touched, amidst ihunders, and lightning, and\nt,empest---and tha.t he had punished its violation\nby terrible plagues-for them to belie1e these\nthings wottld have been absolutely impossible,\nhad the whole narrative been a fiction. A\nromance would have ejtcited their ridicule, and\nthe yoke whic;h, on the ground\u00b7of the invention,\nwas to be placed about their necks, would have\nbeen :rejected with the utmost indignation. It is\nalso morally impossible that th~ books of Moses\ncould have beeri received in the age imniediat~ly\nafter his death, if their ~orttents had been fulse;\nand highly imp?t>bablethat, thottgh true, they\n\u2022\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n180 :IIIRACLES.\n,\u2022,ould have been considered his writings, if they\nhad been set forth by some other person in his\nname, and had not appeared till he was lying\nin his grave.\nIt would be easy to show that the wondrous\nacts recorded are traced explicitly to Divine_\noperat~on. In illustration of this, the following\npassages may be taken : \" I am the Lord, your\nHoly One, the Creator of Israel, your King.\"\n\" Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in\nthe sea and a path in the mighty waters;\"\nalluding, most probably, to the passage of Israel\nthrough the Red Sea, and, afterwards, to their\ncrossing the Jordan, both of which events were\nunquestionably miraculous.\nThat one great object kept in view by the\nRedeemer in performing miracles was, to furnish\nconvincing proofs of his Divine mission, is\nevident from the uniform tenor of the inspired\nnarratives. Nicoden1us reasoned justly when he\nsaid, \"Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher\ncome from God: for no man can dothese miracles\nthat thou doest, except God be with him,\" John\niii. 2. The same \u00b7conviction was possessedby\nthe chief priests and the Pharisees, for they\nsai~, after the resurrection of Lazarus, \" This\nman doeth many miracles: if we let him thus\nalone all men will believe on him,\" John xi.\n47, 48. Our Lord himself appeals to his mira-\ncles: \" I have greater witness than that of John,\nfor the works which the Father bath given me to\nfinish, the same works that I do baa, witness of\nme, that the Father bath sent me,\" John v. 86.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fTHE RESURRECTION\nOF CHRIS'f. 1S1\nIt is impossible, therefore, that any statement\ncould be more plain and decisive. Our Lord\nrests his claim to be believed on the wonders\nhe ,vronght. Again, he s.ays, \" If I had not\ndone a1nong them the works which none other\nman did, they had not had sin ; but now they\nhave no cloak for their sin.\" 'l'hus, we see the\nwonders which Christ wrou.ght were unparal-\nleled. He healed the sick, he penetrated the\nminds of men by his own infinite power. And\nhence, the unbelief of those who witnessed his\nmighty deeds appeared in all its aggravated and\nnaked enormity; \"their sin remained.\" But, in\ndirect opposition to this, there would have been\na plea for unbelief had pretended miracles been\ntrue. Had it been a fact, instead of a fable, that\n.LEsculapiushad cured disease at his oracle, or\nthat the god of the oracle of Claros had known\nthe thoughts of men's hearts, then, and then\nonly, there would have been a cover for their\niniquity.\nWere we.to select one miracle as demonst~a-\ntive that Jesus was sent by the Father, and of\nthe acceptance of his work; and, still further,\nof the futility of every objection that can be\nraised against it; it should be that of the resur-\nrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. \" See,\" says\nSaurin, \" how :111any\nextravagant suppositions\nmust be advanced if the resurrection of our\nSaviour be denied.

On this controverted question we\ndo not enter; it is sufficient for \u00b7the present\npurpose to remark, that the superiority of the\nservants of J~hovah was placed beyo~d all dis-\npute. The rod of Aaron swallowed up the\nrods of the magicians ; at the plague of flies\nand the murrain on the cattle, they were com-\npelled to say, \" This is the finger of God ;\" and\nat length they \" could not stand before Moses\nbecause of the boils, for the boils were upon the\nmagicians and all the Egyptians,\" Exod. ix. 11.\nAnother instance of a later date is equally\nconclusive. 'fhe gospel was proclaimed at\nEphesus, where the arts which pretended to\nlay open the secrets of nature, and to arm the\nhand of man with supernatural powers, were\nespecially apparent. Indeed, in the age of our\nLord and bis apostles, pretended adepts in the\noccult sciences were numerous ; they travelled\nfrom country to\u00b7country, and were found in great\nnumbers in Asia, deceiving the credulous mul-\ntitude, and profiting by their expectations.\nThey were sometimes Jews, who refe~ed their\nskill, and even their forms of proceeding, to\nSolomon, who is still regarded in the east as\nthe head or prince of magicians. In Asia\nMinor, Ephesus bad a high reputation for\nmagical arts. Here, then, \" God wrought spe-\ncial miracles by the hands of Paul.\" The\nappeal to the wonder-workers of a country\n,vhich contained so n1agnificent a temple to\nDiana, that it was reckoned an1ong the wonders\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fMAGICAL\nARTS AT EPHESUS. . l~a\nof the world, was singularly striking. .Accus-\ntomed as the Ephesians were to produce strange\nresults by some species of magic, they would\nnaturally ascribe miracles to a similar agency.\nIt was necessary, therefore, that the miracles\nwhich were to serve as the credentials of Chris-\ntianity, should be especially marked, and placed\nbeyond the reach\u00b7 of all their enchantments and\nincantations. And it seems an instance not\nthe less remarkable, because easily overlooked,\nof the adaptation of means to an end, that in\nEphesus, in which, of all others, magic was\nresorted to, the powers granted to the first\nheralds of redeeming mercy sufficed to place\nthem at an immeasurable distance above the\nmost consummate magicians.\nAnother fact is equally entitled to attention.\nCertain Jews travelling in that country, and pro-\nfessingtocast out the evil spirits which frequently\npossessed the bodies of men, took upon them,\nas avowed exorcists, to employ the name of the\nLord Jesus, from the success with which it was\nused by the apostle Paul. Amongst these were\nthe seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, who addressed\nan evil spirit in the name of Christ, thinking,\nperhaps, that their number would give special\nforce to their adjuration.

Therefore, he added, \"And I know\nthat thou hearest me always: but because of\nthe people which stand by I said it, that they\nmay believe that thou h~t sent me.\" And\nas on other occaaions, he said, \" Thy sins are\nforgiven thee\"-\" Arise, take up thy bed and\nwalk\"-\"l command thee to come out of her,\"\n10 now he cried with a loud voic~, \" Lazarus,\ncome forth.

How strikingly con-\ntrasted. was the language of the apostles I In\nthe case of the lame man laid at the beautiful\ngate of the\u00b7 temple, Peter said, \"Silver and\ngold have I none; but such as I have give I\nthee: In -the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\n1ise up and walk.\" These words, uttered on\nthe first miracle of the apostles, expressed the\ngreat principle on which they performed every\nother, and the spirit in which they wrought all\ntheir wondrous deeds.\nThe apostle, _likethe prophet, laid down his\nauthority, and resigned his commission\u00b7 with\nhis life; but our Lord Jesus Christ not only\nexercised his power amidst his last sufferings\nand death, but extended his authority beyond\nthe grave.\" \" I lay down my life of myself;\nno man taketh it from me; I have power to lay\nit down, and I have power to take it again.\"\nAnd though he said, \" This c9mmandment\nhave I received of my Father,\" he also added,\n\"I and my Father are one\"-\" thereby,\" as the\nJews distinctly perceived, \" making himself\nequal with God.\"\nEven the diversity of gifts distributed among\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fCESSATION\nOPMmACLES. 189\nprimitive saints, proved the infinite resources\nof Him by whom they were granted. Though\nbestowed by the Holy Spirit, they were pur-\nchased by the blood and supplied by the grace\nof the Son of God. Speaking of the outpouring\nof the Spirit, and its results, Jesus said, \" He\nshall receive of mine, and shall show it unto\nyou.\" Most emphatically does he lay claim to\nall the fulness of the Godhead, when he adds,\n\" All thmgs that the Father bath are mine :\ntherefore said I, that he shall take \u00b7or_\nmine, and\nshow it unto you.\" 'fhus, the gift of tongues,\nof miracles, of prophecy, and of interpretation,\nproved the infinite power of the Giver, on whose\nwill the extent and diversity of the operation\nalike depended. Some had one power and\nsome another: but all these wrought that one\nand the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man\nseverally as he would. 1 Cor. xii. 11. .\nThe miraculous endowments of early times\nwere, however, transient. Certain facts appear\nto be conclusive on this point. No gift was\nmore highly estimated, or considered more\nnecessary for the propagation of the gospel,\n.than the gift of tongues. And yet, this was,\nunquestionably, of short duration. The only\nreference made to it in all the documents of\nantiquity, is in the work of Ireneus against the\nheretics. He says, \" We hear of many in the\nchurch imbued with prophetic gifts, speaking\nwith all kinds of tongues.\" But \u00b7though he\nmust have required the gift as much as any-\nfor he was called to labour for the dift'mionof\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nJllRAOl,1;5.\nthe gospel among the pagan Celts-yet he ex-\npressly declares, \" It was not the least part of\nhis trouble, that he was forced to learn the\nlanguage of the oountry, a rude and barbarous\ndialect, befoi\"ehe could effect any good among\nthem.\" Augustine, it iaevident, knew nothing\nof supernatural power like that which some\nhad possessed at a former period. \" In the\nprimitive times,\" he says, \"the Holy Spirit fell\nupon believers, and they spoke in tongues\nwhich they had not learned, as the Spirit .gave\nthem utterance.

It enlarges\nhis -sphere of contemplation, prompts him to\nthe highest action, binds each individual to his\u00b7\nkind, soothes him with the most lasting enjoy-\nments, and constitutes at once the food and\nmedicine of the soul. But faith is a good only\nwhen reason has den1andedand secured adequate\ngrounds for its exercise. When these are\npresent, belief ennobles and invigorates man;.\nwhen they are wanting, it proves a disgrace\nand a curse. The ruin of our first parents was,\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n8 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nthat, forsaking their confidence in God, they\ncherished faith in the promises of the evil spirit.\n'fhey were thus seduced to destruction. The\ninstrument which, when tuned according to the\nrules of truth and rectitude, uttered the sweetest\nmelodies, became, when these were wanting, a\nfractured thing, from which nothing could pro-\nceed but a chaos of wild sounds, full of discord.\nCredulity was man's first sin-a sin which,\nsince that moment, has been continually re-\npeated.\nError has thus become an element inseparable\nfrom the existence of human nature. As, in\nhis first fall, man had been allured by the lying\npromise, \" Ye shall be as gods\"-so he has\nsince that period been ever -deceived by some\nambitious hope, as brilliant and as false as that\nwhich constituted his earliest temptation. Some\nof the errors into which our fellow-creatures\nhave betm led will be recorded in the following\npages. But those which we can here enumerate\nare only specimens, and many of them specimens\nof delusion in its mildest form. The greater\ndevelopments of credulity are not within our\npresent scope. But all sin is credulity of the\nfalse; all virtue springs from belief of the true.\nRegarding the subject, however, as we now\ndo, in its secondary manifestations alone, it is\nboth vast and distressing. The idolatry which\nclings to a material representation of the\nDivinity; the intolerance which demands homage\nto the past, and refuses to acknowledge all\nadvance of intelligence ; the mad hopes by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fARE FOSTERED\nBY IGNORANCE. 9\nwhich mankind have been disgraced, and the\nwars by which they have been desolated; the\nfruitless projects of the ignorant and designing;\nthe intemperance which has proved the bane of\none crowd, and the licentiousness which has\nproved the ruin of another; the idle amusements\nof the frivolous, and the dark passions of the\nmalignant; the desire for the undue prolonga-\ntion of human life; the baseless dreams of the\ncovetous, and the desire of the clissatisfied to\npry into the secret and unknown ;-these, and\na thousand kindred errors, all have their origin\nin a single principle, the proneness of man to\nbe flattered by his wishes, and to believe in the\nimmediate and the sensible, rather than in the\nremote, however real.\nMany circumstances, superadded to t1ieten-\ndencies derived\u00b7 from the fall, co-operate in\nfostering such manifold delusions.\nIt is almost superfluous to remark, how this\n\u00b7propensity to be deceived is increased by ignO\"\".\nranee; for as knowledge is the apprehension\nof truth, whilst credulity is the apprehension\nonly of the semblance of truth, knowledge and\ncredulity must be ever opposites. We cannot,\ntherefore, wonder that the .Jeastcivilized ages of\nsociety have ever been most prolific in certain\nerrors. They have swarmed in the dark hot-\nbeds of vicious ignorance.

Indeed, of all the de-\nlusions to which n1ankind has been liable, none\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fINCOMPLETE\nKNOWLEDGE. 11\nhave been more remarkable than those which\nhave followed in the wake of a commencing\nperiod of human enlightenment. To this class\nmay be referred such superstitions as astrology,\nalchemy, and the El-Dorado. To this also we\nmust refer the various absurdities of the school-\nmen. The common mind of that day was,\nindeed, grossly dark; but the scholars were in\ncomparative light. Yet, absurd and trifling in\nthe highest degree were the studies to which\neven the best of them were addicted. Speci-\nmens of such delusions may be observed in the\nfollowing pages. In this connexion lord Bacon\nappropriately observes, that, \"like as many\nsubstances in nature which are solid do putrify\nand corrupt into worms, so it is the property of\ngoodand sound knowledge to putrify and dis-\nsolve into a number of subtle, idle, unwholesome,\nand, as I may term them, vermiculate questions,\nwhich have indeed a kind of quickness and life\nof spirit, but no soundness of matter or goodness\nof quality.\"*\nNor is it unnatural that the progress in\nknowledge gained by the more advanced should\nbe greatly disbelieved and abundantly miscon-\nstrued by the vulgar mind. Spirit, as well as\nmatter, has its inertia,or love of. rest, and\ntends, like every heavy body, to retain its\noriginal position; whilst whatever would disturb\nthat condition is readily resolved into the\nmiraculous, and therefore unlawful. We are\nnot surprised if the first invention of printing\nDi itiz by\ng\n\u2022 \" Advance of Leaming.\"\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n12 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nappeared to our forefathers a piece of monstrous\nmagic, or if that of gunpowder appeared, just\nin the sense in which the imputation was not\ntrue, attributable to infernal agency. Men\nresist the progress of knowledge, not only\nbecause it sometimes opposes their own pe-\ncuniary and other interests, but because they\nhave a disinclination to admit society to be in\nadvance of themselves.\nIt will be easily apparent, moreover, how\nmany of the prodigious wonders admitted by\nhuman c~edulity have arisen out of that morbid\ncuriosity and false sensibility which is one of\nthe most degraded forms of our fallen nature,\nespecially when, as developed in ill-regulated\nminds, it puts on the form of a passion of\nincredible strength. Of this diseaseour journals\nfurnish continual evidence. To-day it is the\ninclination to pry into the details of some tale\nof domestic sorrow, and to-morrow it is an\ninsatiable appetite after the details of some\nghastly murder, in each case demanding \u00b7par.:\nticulars with au eagerness which respects no\nbounds, and with a voracity which no amount\nof circumstantia]s can satisfy. For the moment,\nand in repudiation of every principle and of\nevery fact, the notorious criminals of the day\nbecome deified, and the very attention excited\nby their enormous crimes, drives the weak or\nthe wicked to become their imitators.\nNor can ,ve wonder how, during past ages,\nand at the suggestion of an interested priest-\nhood, from whose devices and intrigues many\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fHYPOCRISY\nAND CCWETOUSNESS. 18\nof these delusions sprang, tales of super-\nnatural dealings assumed a form absolutely\nhorrific. The advance of daylight has dispersed\nsuch forms into air ; though let it be carefully\nobserved, spectral terrors are fainter in the\nlight of modern Protestantism than in that of\nany other religious system.\nIt is painful to add to these instances those\nin which absolute hypocrisy has had a com-\nmanding share. But it is impossible to exempt\nsome cases related in the following pages from\nthat dark and dread charge. Every strong will\nhas a power greater than that of magic itself\nover the ignorant and inexperienced. And if\nit happen that the deceiver shall, under the\nawful names of God and religion, hold out lures\nwhich appeal to the passions or foster the\ncaprices of the multitude, especially if his\nsystem be a strongly imaginative one, (an essen-\ntial ingredient in most similar cases,) his success\nwill be probably in proportion to the venerable-\nness.of the names he invokes. The very crav-\ning after spiritual food becomes thus a vehicle\ntor every unwholesome and baneful poison.\nThere is, however, no form of error which\nhas more decidedly outlived the appliances of\nknowledge than those which are associated with\nan inordinate desire of gain. The limits within\nwhich the good things of this world should be\nacquired and possessed, are distinctly marked\nout by the great Proprietor himself. Let men\noverstep these bounds, and the result is unutter-\nable confusion and distraction.

'l'hey thus transmitted a legacy of\ncredulity to a posterity sufficiently eager to turn\nit to account. Many of these superstitions\nwere derived from Jewish sources, especially\nfrom the Rabbins, a remarkably fantastical and\nimaginative tribe. The Druidical religion of\nancient Britain and the contiguous parts of the\ncontinent was not less credulous. All readers\nof ancient British history are familiar with the\nname of the misletoe,\n(viscumalbum,) a parasi-\u00b7\ntical plant, which took root within the bark\nof the oak, though now very rarely found\non that tree, and bears flowers and fruit.\nIt is believed to have derived its sanctity, not\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\nl\n\fSUPERSTITIONS OF ANGLO-SAXONS. 17\nonly from the peculiar position in which it\nwas found, namely, on the wood of the tree\nthen commonly selected for their worship, but\nalso from the circumstance that its leaves and\nberries grow in clusters of three, deemed by the\nDruids a mystical number. At the close of\nthe year, the priests went in solemn procession\nto gather this plant, and peculiar ceremonies\nattended its removal from the oak. It was\nrequired to be cut with a golden knife by a\npriest habited in pure white, and it might\nbe gathered only when the moon was six days\nold, whilst the detached branch was received\nwith peculiar solemnity into a napkin held\nbeneath the tree. Subsequently, it was identi-\nfied by many with the forbidden tree of Eden,\nand was supposed to be a specific for peculiar\ndisorders. The shamrock, or trefoil, was re-\ngarded by the Irish Druids as possessed of a\nsimilar sanctity.\nThe Saxon conquerors of these islands\nbrought over with them, as ele1nents of their\nferocious religion, many similar superstitions.\nThe descendants of the more ancient inhabit-\nants of these islands, namely, the dwellers in\nthe Highlands, in Wales, in Cornwall, and in\nthe Isle of Man, still preserve sitnilar delusions\nin their fullest force. Many of these notions\n. were retained, scarcely modified, by the Anglo-\nSaxons when Christianized, (to use that word\nin a very popular sense,) and the imperfect\nknowledge of religion possessed by our fore-\nfathers is shown in nothing more strongly than\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nin the laws enacted to repress tbe spells and\nincantations prevalent in those days of im-\nperfect enlightenment.

In\ndays a little later, the notion which men had\nof education was that it was something akin to\na Divine inspiration, and it was a practice with\nmany parents, and those probably of the better\nsort, to interrogate their sleeping children on\nSt. George's-day as to whether they would\nstudy their book or not. If the half-sleeping\nchild uttered something affirmative, he was\ndevoted, when the parents could afford it, to\nsome learned profession; if the reply was un-\nfavourable, a handicraft occupation was selected.\nTo beat a child with an alder stick was ominous,\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nSUPERSTITIONSOF SAILORS. 19\nas it was the infallible way of stopping his\ngrowth.

The misfortunes\nof James n. were intimately connected, in the\nopinion of many, with the rending of the\ncloth of gold on the day of his inauguration ;\nand that no good could come from the number\ntwo was incontestably proved by the misfor-\ntunes of William 11.,\nHenry 11.,\nRichard n.,\nCharles n., and James n.\nThe minds of sailors-men peculiarly re-\nmoved from the ordinary advantages of educa-\ntion-are still extremely full of such supersti-\ntions.

Moonwort trodden on\nby a horse loosened his shoes fron1 his feet.\nRue was a preventive of witchcraft. A bay-\nleaf was a preservative against thunder. Such\nspecimens might be indefinitely extended.\nThe 25th of January, St. Paul's-day, was\nregarded by our forefathers as a crisis of great\nimportance, because it was believed that the\n. weather of the whole year might be predicted\nfrom the meteorology of that day. \"If the sun\nshine, it betokens a good year ; if it rain or\nsnow, an indifferent one ; if misty, it predicts\ngreat dearth ; if it thunder, great winds, and\ndeath of people that year.\" This prognostic\n,vas afterwards reduced to rhyme :-\n\" If St. Paul's-day be fair and clear\nIt does betide a happy year ;\nBut if it chance to snow or rain,\nThen will be dear all kinds of grain.\nIf clouds or mists do dark the sky,\nGreat store of birds and beasts shall die;\nAnd if the winds do fly aloft,\nThen wars shall vex the kingdom oft.\"\nModern opinions have ignored the portents\nof St. Paul's-day;\" but those of St. Swithin\n(July 15) still survive. The legend which\npertains to this day is curious. Swithin was\na Danish bishop of Winchester, who, at his\ndeath, expressed his desire to be buried in\nthe- churchyard instead of the chancel of his\nminster. The monks of Winchester, however,\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n22 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nzealous for the glories of so bright a saint, and\ndesirous of securing for his remains a better\nplace of sepulture, determined that his body\nshould be removed into the choir of the cathe-\ndral. But on the day fixed (July 15) for its\nremoval, and during the forty days succeeding,\nit rained so violently as to impress them with\nthe conviction that what they intended was a\nforbidden act, and they contented themselves\nwith erecting a chapel over his grave. Poor\nRobin's Almanac (1697) has the following dog-\ngrel, in which, however, a n1oralmay be found:-\n\" In this month is St. Swithin's-day,\nOn which, if that it rains,.they aay,\nFull forty days after it will,\nOr more or less, some rain distil.\nThis Swithin was a saint, I trow,\nAnd Winchester's bishop also;\nWho in bis time rudmany a feat,\nAs Popish legends do repeat.\nA woman having broke her eggs,\nBy stumbling at another's legs,\nFor which she made e.woful cey,\nSt. Swithin chanced for to come by,\nWho made them all as sound, or more,\nThan ever that they were before ;\n\u00b7 But whether this were so or no,\n'Tis more than you or I do know.\nBetter it is to rise betime,\nAnd to make hay while sun doth shine,\nThan to believe m tales or lies\nW'1ich idle monks and friars devise.\"*\nMost of our readers will remember sufficient\ninstances of failure to prove that this prognostic\nof St. Swithin's-day is by no means infallible ;\nand it is a somewhat remarkable circumstance\nthat though, in 1752,the new style was adopted\nin place of the old, (to cause the nominal to\n\u2022 Brande's Popular Anti:iuities, vol. i. pp. 340, 341.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fagree with astronomical time,) and though\neleven days were thereby sunk in the calendar,\nit made no difference to St. Swithin's credit.\nThe superstition appears to have no other foun-\ndation than this, that at certain parts of the\nyear the weather, whatever it may be, extends\nover somewhat long periods, and that at the\ntime of St. Swithin it is more than usually\nuniform. A similar notion seems to have for-\nmerly prevailed relative to St. Vitus's-day,\n(June 15.) Candlemas-day also (Feb. 2) once\nenjoyed the same prerogative.\nIn some parts of England, a singular super-\nstition formerly prevailed, that when any one\nof a family died, the members of the household\nn1ust inform the bees, if there were any, of the\nevent, or else that some calamity would after-\nwards befall those poorinsects themselves. This\nopinion is still current in some neighbourhoods,\nand is marked by hanging, in such a case, black\ncrape upon the hive, or suspending the mourn-\ning somewhere in its vicinity. It is related in\na London newspaper, that at a funeral of a rich\nold farmer, which took place in Devon, the\nfol1owingcircumstance occurred: \"Just as the\ncorpse was placed in the hearse, and the horse-\nmen to a large number were drawn up in order\nfor the procession of the funeral, a person\ncalled out, ' Turn the bees ;' when a servant,\nwho had no knowledge of such a custom,\ninstead of turning the hives about, lifted\nthem up, and then laid them down on their\nsid~s. The bees, thus hastily invaded, instantly\nDi itiz by\ng\n...\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n24 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nattacked and fastened on the horses and their\nriders. It was in vain they galloped off; the\nbees as precipitately followed, and left their\nstings as marks of their indignation. A general\nconfusion took place, attended with loss of hats,\nwigs, etc., and the corpse during the conflict\nwas left unattended, nol' was it till after a con-\nsiderable time that the funeral attendants could\nbe rallied, in order to proceed to the interment\nof their deceased friend.\"*\n\u00b7It was deemed essential by our ancestors,\nthat certain remedies should be applied three,\nseven, or nine times. The importance of these\nnumhers is also shown in other connexions. A\nroyal salute \u00b7with cannon is to this day com-\nposed of three times seven, or twenty-one guns.\nA superstition was prevalent, that a company\nof thirteen was unlucky, and that one of the\nnun1ber was certain to die within the year. The\nfact might be so, as the probabilities of life are\nin something approaching to that proportion.\nThe.seventh son of a seventh son (an occur-\nrence, the infrequency of which would neces-\nsarily place it beyond the opportunity of frequent\nobservation) was supposed to be born a genius,\nand some even averred that he had the power\nof healing scrofulous disorders, like former\nmonarchs, by his touch. At all events, it was\ncleem~d essential that he must be brought up\nto the study of medicine. These notions were\ndoubtless derived from the frequent use c,f the\nperfect number sevenamong the Jews.\n\u2022 Brande, vol. ii. p. 301.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fINFLUENCEOF .MOON.\n\"The hand of glory,\" as it was called, though\na phrase almost unintelligible to mode!n ears,\nwas regarded by our forefathers as endowed\nwith strangely mystic virtues, and was fre-\nquently employed by thieves and housebreakers\n\u00b7 in their depredations, since it was supposed to\nconfer the power of entering houses without\nobstruction from any who might encounter it.\nThe hand of a malefactor exposed on the high-\nway was to be obtained. The effect of this,\nwhen duly prepared, was, that it took away (so\nit ,vas believed) all power of motion from the\nperson before whom it was held.\nThe singular influences ascribed by our\nforefathers to the moon, are evidently remnants\nof the more ancient pagan worship of that\nluminary.

Burton, in his Anatomy, says\nthat a black spot is a bad omen. It is certainly\na sign either of previous injury or advancing\ndisease.\nA common superstition is still current, that\nin marriage the ring is put upon the fourth\nfinger of the left hand because an artery goes\nfrom that finger to the heart. This is a perfect\ndelusion, though once seriously believed by very\ngrave persons. The popish superstitions once\nconnected with the wedding-ring are well known\nto have led the early Puritans to desire that its\nuse might be abolished.\nSpirits were supposed to be detected by the\nblue burning of candles; whilst a knot of tallow\nnear the flame was called a winding-sheet, and\nregarded as a presage of approaching death to\none of the family. The howling of dogs (per-\nhaps derived from some afflicted animal being\nfound grieving over the dead body of his\nmaster) was regarded as a similar prognostic.\nIf crickets forsook a house they had been long\naccustomed to inhabit, it boded deep calamity.\n'fo kill a spider, and not to kill a snake, were\ndeemed equally disastrous. A very ancient\nsuperstition was, that the dead body of a mur-\ndered man would gush out blood if the mur-\nderer approached it. It is not very easy to\nconjecture from what this evidently false super-\nstition arose. Its original invention was de-\nsigned, perhaps, to terrify the guilty man into\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fFERN-SEED. 27\nconfession. It is accounted for, however, in\nanother way, by a well-known work, called\n\" The Ath~nian Oracle.,, \" Blood is congealed\nin the body for two or three days, and then\nbecomes liquid again, in its tendency to cor-\nruption. The air being heated by many persons\ncoming about tha body is the same thing as\nmotion to it ; it is observed that dead bodies\nwill bleed in a concourse of people, when mur-\nderers are absent as well as present.\"\nIt is ,vell known to all who have the slightest\nacquaintance with the elements of botany, that\nthere is a certain class of vegetables which\nderive the name of \" Cryptogamia,\"from the\nseeds being produced in a manner which is not\nreadily apparent. The fern, for instance, bears\nits seeds on the underside of its leaf, where\nthey are beautifully arranged, and may at the\nproper season be distinctly observed. It was\nonce supposed that the seed of the fern was\nactually invisible, and that those who possessed\nit (though according to this supposition they\ncould by no means become certified of its pre-\nsence) were, by its means, gifted with the\nfaculty of invisibility. But in order that this\nvirtue might be imparted, it was necessary to\ngather it on midsummer eve.\nThe deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna)\nwas supposed to derive its poisonous qualities\nfrom its growing, as it often did, among the\ndark deposits of death and corruption. These\ninvested it with an imaginary horror, and\ngreat magical virtues were attributed to it.\nDi itiz by\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n28 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nBut the mandrake (Atropa mandragora)was\nassociated with even more deadly and porten-\ntous attributes. It was imagined to grow under\nthe gallows, and to be nourished by the distil-\nlations of executed malefactors, and it was\nbelieved that when it was eradicated it uttered\na great shriek, as if possessing sensibility. To\nguard against the pestilential effects of gather-\ning it, some authors recommended that the\nplants should be tied to a dog, who, being driven\naway, would pull up the plant with him. We\ncan scarcely wonder at the feelings with which,\nin the dark ages, this plant was regarded, when\nwe are a,vare of its botanical peculiarities. Its\nroot, severed in some directions, bears a consi-\nderable affinity to the human form. Its smell\nis extremely fretid, and its properties venomous\nto a high degree. It is, however, a native only\nof the south of Europe. But its peculiarities\nbecame identified in England with the ropt of\nthe briony, which was, by a juggle, often cut\nso as to imitate its form.\n\u00b7The Glastonbury thorn was also, in the olden\ntime, an object of great notoriety. It was\nreported to blossom only on Christmas day, and\nsome said that it budded in the morning,\nflowered at noon, and decayed on the night of\nthe 25th of December. Its virtues were\nascribed to Joseph of Arimathrea, said to be\nthe founder of the first Christian church in\nEngland, (,vhich a foolish tradition placed at\nGlastonbury,) and was believed to have ~;rung\nfrom the staff which he stuck into the ground\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fGLASTONBURY\nTHORN. 29\nwhilst laying the foundation.

The only\nfoundation for the legend is, that at Glaston-\nbury and its vicinity grow certain thorns,\nwhich, like the Helleborusniger,or Christmas\nrose, blossom at a very early period of the\nyear.\nSuch superstitions as those we have narrated\nabove are not as yet, as we have remarked,\naltogether obsolete. We believe that even yet,\nin London, a shop exists in which certain beads\nare sold, made from the root of the white\nbriony, and once supposed to possess a singular\nvirtue when bung around the necks of children\ncutting their teeth. But such delusions are\nfast disappearing before the increasing light of\nintelligence; and though persons are still to\nbe found who transmit to ignorant men and\nsimple women the traces of such old-fashioned\nsuperstitions, they are destined soon to share\nthe fate of the broomstick of the witcl1, and the\nterrors of St. George and the dragon.

It will now be our office to point out\nto our readers the path of en\u00b7or through which -\nthis, and other departments of science, have had\nto struggle.\nWhen the ancients stepped out of the circle\nof their positive knowledge, they involved\nthemselves in a maze of the most palpable\nerrors. The fables of the Cimmerians, who\ndwelt at the ends of the ocean clouded in\nperpetual night; the story of .lEo]us and his\nbag of winds ; the island of Circe, peopled by\nenchanters-were delusions which, propagated\nby the idle and believed by the credulous,\nwould very naturally take root in barren and\nuncultivated soils.

He speaks of\nants like foxes, w}lo,burrowing in the golden\nsands of India, first turned up its treasures to\nthe view. Plutarch speaks also of little snakes,\nwhich crept into men's bodies-only an ex-\naggeration of the tortures still inflicted in the\nmarshy lands of Africa by the guinea-wor1n.\nThe ancient geographer, Strabo, represented\nBritain as a land not worth the conquest, and\nIreland as a region of eternal snows, peopled\nby cannibals.

Travellers of that day\nspoke of trees which bore flowers like wate1\u00b7-\npots; whilst the most energetic efforts were\nmade to discover the site of the ancient\nParadise, the western nations assigning its\nposition eastward, and the eastern nations\nwestward-both agreeing in believing that it\ng\n\u2022 D'lsraeli'a Curiosities of Literature.\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fTHE ARABIANS. . 35\nwas equally distant from themsel,,es.

It is upon\nrecord that, in those days, eight hides of land\nwere given for a book filled with such tales of\ngeographical marvels. Stories of red hens\nfound near the Red Sea, which consumed any\none who touched them; of human beings eight\nfeet broad, who wore their heads on their\nbreasts; of women with boars' tusks and camels'\nfeet; and of other beings, with mouths like the\nsails of a windmill. lbn Bathuta asserted that\nhe had seen Adan1's footstep left on the top of a\nmountain in Serendib; also that he had beheld\nrubies as large as hens' eggs ; and, more\nwonderful than all, that, in some far distant\npart,\u2022 leeches sprang from trees upon unwary\ntravellers, so that the natives were compelled\nto carry lemons, that by squeezing their juice\non them, they might be detached from their\nhold.

The Crusades, by bringing\nmen into real acquaintance with distant lands,\ngave the first shock to the lethargy of monkish\nsuperstition, and contributed much to the\nimprovement of geographical science. The\napplicatio11 of the magnetic principle to the\nformation of the mariner's compass, and the\ndiscovery of America by Columbus, rapidly\nreduced the remaining ignorance. But all\nmarvels had not yet grown obsolete. One of\nthe great difficulties which Columbus had to\novercome in the prosecution of his maritime\ndiscoveries, was the notion entertained by\nSpanish divines as to the shape of the sea. He\nwas gravely assured, that his vessels would, if\nthey proceeded in a certain direction, sail down\na deelivity, which they would not be able again\nto ascend.\nWhat ,vonders were not related of the\nEl-Dorado, or the Golden Country, in the\nsixteenth century l This region, supposed to lie\nsomewhere between the Orinoco and Amazon\nrivers, was regarded as prolific in gold and\njewels, which were as plentiful as the pebbles\non our roads. It was true that the treasures\nthemselves eluded the search of travellers, but\nthey were always imagined to be a little in\nadvance of the \u00b7regions then penetrated. Sti-\nmulated by these tales of the exuberant riches\nof El-Dorado, or using them as a pretext for\ncovering over his \u00b7own purposes, sir vY\nalter\nI!aleigh proposed the conquest of Guiana, and\nthe discovery of this country, in which the\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz y\n88 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\ntemples were roofed over with gold, and where\nthe natives, whilst celebrating their feast.a,were\naccustomed, it was said, to roll their bodies, pre-\nviously rubbed with a precious balsam, in gold\ndust. The expedition failed, of course, in its\nimmediate object, but it led to some geographi-\ncal discoveries of much importance. Even so\nlate as the publication of sir T. More's\ni, Utopia,\" that book was taken for a genuine\nhistory, and some readers thought it highly\nimportant that missionaries should be sent to\nteach so intelligent a nation the truths of\nChristianity.\nThe discoveries made in natural philosophy\nby Roger Bacon, who died in the year 1292,\nwere greatly in advance of his age. As an\nastrologer and alchemist, for to both these\nsciences he was addicted, he might appropri-\nately find a, place in a later chapter ; but his\n\u00b7 reputed invention of gunpowder, (though the\ninhabitants of China and of India lay a claim\nto it,) his conception of the telescope, (though\nother hands perfected the machine,) and his\ntreatises on optics and experimental philosophy,\njustly entitle him to be regarded as the greatest\nphilosopher of his age. Such studies were\nregarded as extremely inconsistent, however,\nwith the duties of a Cordelier friar, and popular\nindignation accused hhn of extensive dealings\nwith the devil.\nThe following is (as nearly as we can trans-\nlate it) the mysterious sentence in which\nBacon's knowledge of gunpowder is supposed to\ng a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fROGERBACON. 89\nlie concealed.

But if we suppose the hieroglyphical\nwords to denote charcoal, and the\" trick\" the\ngranulation of the mass, we shall certainly\narrive .atgunpowder. In Bacon's Opus Majus\nwe have the following passage, supposed to be\ndesigned to. describe this disastrous and death-\ndealing invention :-\nDi itiz by\n,, Some things disturb the ear so much that\nif they were made to happen suddenly by night\nand with sufficient skill, no city or army could\nbear them. No noise of thunder could compare\nwith them. Some things strike terror on the\nsight, so that the flashes of the clouds are\nbeyond comparison less disturbing. And an\ninstance we take from a childish amusement\nwhich exists in many parts of the world, to\nwit, that with an instrwnent as large as the\nhuman thumb, by the violence of the salt called\nsaltpetre, so horrible a noise is made by the\nrupture of so slight a thing as a bit of parch-\nment, that it is thought to exceed loud thunder,\nand the flash is stronger than the brightest light-\nning.\"\u2022 This certainly has some appearan~e of\nbeing an anticipation of the effectsof gunpowder.\n\u2022 \"Briti1h Worthies,\" vol. i. p. n.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n40 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nRoger Bacon was\u00b7 reported also to have\nformed, by the assistance of friar Bungay, a\nbrazen head, which is not improbable. That\nsome attempt may have been made to produce,\nby automatic agency, a few articulate sounds,\nis also very credible ; nor is it unlikely that\nBacon's servant, terrified at such a machine,\nmay have broken the head in pieces. Manyof\nthe ieats ascribed to Roger Bacon are traceable,\nwe may observe, to the use of the magic lan-\ntern, which is stated to have been one of his\ninventions.\n. The prejudiced delusions with which the\nadv.ances of science have, in many ages, been\ncalled to contend, are in no case more strikingly\nillustrated than by the history of Galileo, who\nlived in the sixteenth century. His discoveries\nwere of the highest philosophical importance,\nand led hipi to the conclusion that the.Ptolen1aic\nsystem of astronomy, though upheld by Aris-\ntotle, the fathers, and misconcei,,ed quotations\nfron1the Bible, was inadequate to account for\nthe phenomena of the universe. He was the\n:first who constructed a perfect telescope ; he\ndetermined the nature of the moon's surface,\ndiscovere4 Jupiter's satellites, and imperfectly\nperceived the ring by which Saturn is sur-\nrounded. But bis disclosures awakened the\nenmity of the Jesuits, and he was summoned\nbefore the Inquisition, who declared his pro-\npositions to be erroneous and dangerous. He\nwas compelled, therefore, to sign a recantation,\nof which the following is a portion :-\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nINVENTION OF PRINTING. 41\n\" With a sincere he.art and unfeigned faith,\nI abjure, curse, and detest the said errors and\nheresies; and I swear that I will never, in\nfuture, say or repeat anyihing, verbally or in\nwriting, which may give rise to a similar sus-\npicion against me.\"\nAs Galileo rose from his knees, however,\nafter this abjuration of bis doctrine concerning\nthe motion of the earth, etc., he muttered to a\nfriend who stood near him, \" It does move,\nthough, notwithstanding !\" A more heroic\nmaintenance of truth would have better become\nso distinguished a philosopher.\nThe invention of printing offended, in a\nsimilar way, the prejudices of the fifteenth cen-\ntury. Fust was the assistant of Guttenberg,\nthe first projector of the art of printing with\nmovable types. Like many other inventors,\nGuttenburg left the harvest of his invention to\nbe reaped by subsequent hands. It is said that,\nin consequence ofFust's employment of this art\nin cornbination with coloured ink, the vulgar\nconcluded that he had signed a compact with\nthe evil spirit in blood. The delusion took a\nstrong hold on the popular imagination, and is\nfrequently reproduced even at this day. Other\naccounts, however, state, that Fust and Faust,\nto whom a somewhat similar notoriety is\nattached, were distinct personages, and that the\nenormities ascribed to the latter originated in\nhis having greatly outstripped his age in pur-\nsuit of the physical sciences.\nWhatever be the degree of truth actually\nB2\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f42 RDL\\RKABLE DELUSIONS.\ninvolved in some of these stories, it is evident\nthat he who is, at any period of the world,\ngreatly in advance of his age, is liable to no\nsmall amount of misconception and misrepre-\nsentation. Perhaps, however, such men as\nthose we have enumerated, rendered themselves\nliable to the imputations circulated against\nthem, by veiling their real knowledge under\nsernhlances which they must have known to be\nfoItacious. If so, the fact may supply a lesson\nof some force to those who, having been\nintrusted with truths of value, seek, by a\npaltry conformity with the maxims of the\nignorant or the vicious, to render them palat-\nable to others. Let the Christian especially\nbeware how he tricks his heaven-born prin-\nciples in the meretricious guise which is \"of\nthe earth, earthy.\" Whilst no cringing to the\nworld can render spiritual religion acceptable to\nthose who know not its value, such an accom-\nmodation will infallibly awaken suspicion,\nand land its professors in deserved contempt.\nOnly one defence will avail the Christian :\n\"the armour of righteousness on the right\nhand and on the left.,,\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fANCIENT REMEDIES AND PRESCRIPTIONS. 43\nCHAPTER IV.\nDELUSIONS INVOLVING HEALTH AND LIFE.\nAncient remedies and preacri,Ptions-Deatb of king John-\nDiaeuea presided over by samt1-Chann1-Aurum potabile\n-Bezoars-Dead man's touch-Touching for king's evil-\nGold bullet-Harvey-Jenner-Animal magnetism.\nAYONG the choicest temporal blessings which\nGod bestows upon man must be reckoned good\nhealth.

Medical science, however, bas\n., been a plant of slow growth. As in the\npresent chapter we review the mass of errors\nand delusions through which the healing art\nhas had to make its advances, we call upon\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n44 UEH.~RKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nour reader to lift his heart in thankfulness to\nGod, for the abounding mercies which distin-\nguish the period in which his lot has been cast.\nAt the time of the Trojan war, the adminis-\ntr~tion of remedies was principally in the hands\nof the priests, who believed that their prayers\naccomplished more than their prescriptions.\n'fhe remedies of the Orientals and the Romans\nconsisted mainly in charms; the Greeks alone\nsurpassed their contemporaries in science.\nCato proposed that, in cases of fracture, the\u00b7\nlitnb whilst bound up should have the fol- .\nlowing charm daily sung over it : \"Huat, hanat,\nista, pista, fista, dominabo damnastra et lu:cala.\"\n'fhe Druids appear to have accompanied their\nmedical appliances by religious ceremonials,\nwhich it was imagined gave them their chief\nvirtue. The n1anner in which the medicinal\nherb was plucked, whether by the right hand\nor the left; the metal of the instrument by\nwhich it was cut off from its stalk ; the time of\nthe day at which it was procured; and even the\ndress of the person collecting the simples, was\ncarefully prescribed; and the alleged absence\nof some parts of the given formula\u00b7 often saved\nthe credit of the operator.\nSome of the ancient monkish legends describe\nking John of England as poisoned by tl1e ad-\nministration of a venomous reptile in his drink. \u2022\n\" Then went the monk into a garden, and found\na toad therein, and took her up, and put her in\na cup, and filled it with good ale, and pricked\nher in every place_in the cup till the venom\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDISEASES PRESIDED OVER BY SAINTS. 45\ncame out in every place, and brought it before\nthe king, and kneeled, and said, ' Sir, wassail;\nfor never in your life drank ye of such a cup.'\n'Begin, monk,' quoth the king. On which the\nIQonk drank of the potion, and retiring from\nthe king's presence, died immediately.\" The\nking himself only survived him two days. So\nruns the legend, which, however untrue to fact,\nsufficiently describes the superstitions of the\nperiod. Similarly, one of the stories of the\nScottish borders represents a young man as\npoisoned by partaking of a dish of stewed\nadders, which he 1nistook for eels. We need\nscarcely say that the toad is not venomous, and\nthat the poison of the adder is confined to its\nfangs.\nAbout the fifteenth century, Jewish medical\npractitioners were much employed in Europe.\nOne of these, John of Gadesden, the court\nphysician of England, ordered the king's son,\nthen sick of the smallpox, to be rolled up in\nscarlet cloth, and his\u00b7room to be hung with the\nsame material, as an infallible remedy.\nThe various diseases of the human body\nwere, after the introduction of Christianity into\nEngland, supposed to lie at the mercy of cor-\nresponding saints. St. Anthony presided over\ninflammations; St. Appolonia and Lucius over\n.. the toothache ; St. Osillia and \u00b7St. Clara over\nsore eyes ; St. Ruffin over madness ; St. Valen-\ntine over epilepsy ; St. Wolfgang over lame-\nness, ~tc.\nRoger Bacon's notions of medicine were full\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n46 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nof tl1e errors of his age. He tells us of a\nParisian sage who cut a serpent nearly in\npieces, and then watched what it would do.\nObserving that it dragged its body to a plant,\nthe leaves of which immediately made it whole,\nlie regarded the circumstance as an infallible\nindication of the 1nedicinal virtues of the indi-\ncated plant. The story is, however, only a\nreflection of a sin1ilar one in the pages of ancient\nn1ythology. The same author asserts that the\nflesh of dragons, ripen~ by severe hunting,\npossesses the greatest virtue in prolonging life.\nThe middle or dark ages abounded with a\ncountless variety of charms, supposed to\npossess efficacy in the removal of various\ndiseases. As a cure for the ague, the word\nA B R A C A D A B A R A was believed to\npossess great mystical virtues.

To cure consumption, certain inhabitants\nof Scotland tied a rag to the finger and toe nails\nof the sick person, and then, having waved it\nthrice round his head, buried it privately. This\nappears to be a relic of Druidism. Ricketty\nchildren were drawn through a split tree, which\nwas afterwards bound up so that its several\nparts might grow together, and the recovery of\nthe diseased child WM believed to correspond\nwith the restoration of the tree. A cure for\nhooping-cough was found in mounting the\npatient on a black ass, led nine times round an\noak tree, or sometimes in giving the hair of the\nchild, rolled up in butter, to a dog. It was\nbelieved in some parts of Berkshire that a ring\nmade out of con1munion money wasa sovereign\nremedy against convulsions. ,.\nSometimes these charms assun1ed a religious\nform, which, if not invented by priests, were\nnot at least forbidden by them.\nAll this is deplorable, and exhibits an amount\nof ignorance and infatuation of which the\npresent enlightened age would be ashamed.\n\u2022 Sco~t's \" Discovery of Witchcraft,\" p. 116.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f48 REMARKABLEDELUSIONS.\nSome of these charms approach so near to the\nblasphemous, as to forbid their insertion in our\npages.

Little doubt can exist that the aurum\npotahile\u2022 was meant to throw the precious\nmetal, not so much into the throat of the patient\nas into the pocket of the physician. At the\nsame period, great virtues were ascribed to\nbezoars,that is, certain hard substances found\nin the interiors of land animals. 'rhese stones\nwere supposed to expel poisons, and were sold\nat enormous prices. One variety of this medi-\ncine was formed from the heart and liver of\nvipers. But at that period, the more disgusting\nthe medicine the greater were its reputed\nvirtues. The reader who has petused the\nthrilling narrative of the death bed of king\nCharles 11.,\nmay remember the nauseous and\nrevolting character of the remedies adopted for\nthe relief of the royal patient. There was a\ncelebrated prescription, called \" treacle of mum-\nmy,\" which was compounded, as its name\nimports, of the dust of ancient Egyptian bodies,\n\u2022.

He relates in his Auto-\nbiography, a nostrum prescribed for one of his\nmany ailments, which gives a curious notion of\nthe state of medical knowledge in his day-\nunless, indeed, it were merely a piece of char-\nlatanism. The account is thus given in Calamy's\nabridgment of his Autobiography : \" Having\n\u2022 Brande, vol. iii. p. 301-303.\ng a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fHARVEY. 51\nread in Dr. Gerhard the admirable eiFects of\nthe B\\Vallowingof a gold bullet upon his own\nfather in a case much like his, he got a gold\nbullet, between twenty and thirty shillings'\nweight.\" But the good man found that the\nbullet, instead of producing the cure he had\nanticipated, was itself a sore and prolonged\ndisorder.\nTill the end of the sixteenth century, so\nfirmly was the authority of the ancients esta-\nblished among members of most learned profes-\nsions, that t.he authority of Aristotle, through\nthe medium of Arabic translations, was quoted\nas decisive of medical questions. When, how-\never, men devoted themselves to the study of\nanatomy, the errors of their previous conclusions\nbecame distinctly obvious.

At the end of the seventeenth century,\npains in the teeth and ears were treated by the\nuse of magnetic toothpicks.

Unquestionably the magnet has\ngreat value in relieving the eye, if troubled\nby the presence of particles of iron and\nsteel. But this has no connexion with its\nmedical, but onjy with its mechanical powers.\nParacelsus, however, extolled its virtues in\ncases in which it might be supposed to exert\nno influence whatever.

So he presently sent ibr his\ngarter, wherewith his hand was first bound, and\nas I called for a basin of water as if I would\nwash my hands, I took a handful of powder of\nwhite vitriol, which I had in my study, and pre-\nsently dissolved it ; as soon as the bloody\ngarter was brought me, I put it within the\nbasin, observing in the interim what l\\Ir.\nHowell did, who stoocltalking with a gentleman\nin the corner of my chamber, not regarding at\nall what I was doing ; but he started suddenly\nas if he had found some great alteration in him-\nself.

Methinks that a pleasing\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nANWAL MAGNETISM. 55\nkind of freshness, as it were a wet cold napkin,\ndid spread over my hand, which hath taken\naway the infiammation that tormented me\nbefore.\" To demonstrate still more the nature\nof this sympathy, sir Kenelm relates that, after\ndinner, and in Mr. Rowell's absence, he took\nthe garter, and held it before the fire. In a\nshort time, Mr. Rowell's servant came to say\nthat his master was in a great fever. The con-\nnexion hinted at in the last paragraph may be\nwell regarded as somewhat apocryphal. But\nwhatever might be the merit of the powder of\nsympathy, the treatment of the wound by sir\nKenelm, who, contrary to the practice of those\ndays, ordered the patient. to keep it clean, and\nto throw away all plaisters, were well adapted\nto effect a cure. Some notion of the \" philoso-\nphy\" of sir Kenelm may be derived from the\nfact, that this knight recommends the washing\nof the hands in a basin shone into by the moon\nwithout water, saying, that \"the moonshine\nwould have humidity enough to cleanse the\nhands because of the star from which it is\nderived.\" He declares that this is also an\ninfallible way to remove \u00b7warts.\nLord Bacon refers to the sympathetic powder,\nin his Natural History, with approbation. The\nsecret of composing similar powders, hnd it\nbeen known to the public, would probably have\ncaused many more diseases than cures. It is a\nsingular phenomenon connected with the evi-\ndence of testimony, that remedies praised by a\nthousand mouths in one aae as infallible, should\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz y\n56 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nbe ascertained in the next to possess no virtue\nwhatever. All charlatanism, however, exhibits\nasuccession of similar changes, and has cycles\nof recurrence too.\nIn process of time there arose a new method\nof applying this magnetizing influence. 1.Ir.\nValentine Greatraks, once a soldier of the Com-\nmonwealth, professed to effect astonishing cures\nby stroking with his hands the parts affected.\nHeadache, palsy, rheumatism, epilepsy, con-\nvulsions, were said to yield to this remedial\ntreatment. In 1766, this mode of cure was\ntaken up by }Ies1ner, who was half an astro-\nloger and wholly a quack. He gave similar\napplications the name of a science, and called it\nanimal magnetism, to distinguish it from mineral\nmagnetism, in which it originated.\nThe l!lode in which Mesmer operated in\nParis was extraordinary. He placed in the\ncentre of a room a vessel, about four feet in\ndiameter and one in depth, containing a num-\nber of bottles filled with magnetized water.\nFrom the cover of this vessel proceeded various\nrods of iron, each of which was held by a\npatient, who made one in a circle placed around\nthe baquet,,vhilst every patient was united to\nthe neighbouring one by a chain of connexion.\nCertain \" magnetizers \" then went round, and\ndirected to the patients various passes, till the\nexpected hysterical symptoms began \u00b7to appear.\nAll this was done in perfect silence. Mesmer\nhimself then appeared, dressed in robes of\nflowing silk, and holding in his hand a long\ng a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n\u00b7 AmMAL MAGNETISM. 57\nwand. He professed to regulate the crises of\nhis patients, and when he found them in a con-\nvulsed state, he made passes upon or towards\nthem. At his pleasure, calmness succeeded to\nthe energy of intense action, and the patients\ndescribed themselves as feeling streams of cool-\ning vapour at his touch.\nMesmer now became the talk of the salonsof\nParis. Wealth seemed within his grasp, and\nhe was offered by the king (Louis XVI.) a large\nsum to make known his discovery. He had,\nhowever, no desire to submit his empiricism to\ninvestigation, and removed precipitately to Spa.\nHe left,behind him a partner, M. D'Eslon, who\nafforded to the Royal Commissioners all the\nexplanations he could give, and an inquiry was\nforthwith instituted into the alleged phcno1nena.\nIt was conducted by 1cientific men of the\nhighest reputation. Their conclusion was, that\nanimal magnetism had no proofs to sustain it\nexcept the effects apparently produced on the\nhuman frame-that these effects could be pro-\nduced without passes at all-and that whatever\nmanipulations were employed depended for\ntheir success on the patient's real though uncon-\nscious knowledge. The conclusion was, that\nthe whole process was purely imaginative.\nThe revival of animal magnetism in our own\nday, is a subject of too modern a character for\nus appropriately to handle. The history of this\nart, we n1ay only observe, illustrates very strik-\ningly one great fact-the power of will possessed\nby the resolute and determined over the weak\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f58 RElL\\RKABLEDELUSIONS.\nand diseased sensibilities of an inferior physical\nnature.

Fearful are the exhi-\nbitions afforded, when son1e human being,\nstrong to do evil, controls and tyrannizes over\nhis fellow-man, seducing by his own example,\nand using the victim as the tool for his own\nbase and degrading purposes.

The carnal\nheart, however, while refusing faith to God's\ntestimony on these points, is too often distin-\n~uished by childish credulity with respect to\nfacts respecting the unseen world, which are\nonly man's erro~eous invention. In the follow-\ning chapter some of these will be enumerated\nby us. While carefully desirous of avoiding\nall appear~nce of dogmatism, we feel it in the\noutset our duty to call upon our reader to test\nall narratives of popular superstitions by the\nseverest and strictest law~of evidence. A spirit\nof credulity, however it may be fostered by the\nRomish church, is the very opposite of the\nspirit o-ftrue faith. It is curious, indeed, to\nobserve how those who forsake the latter are\ngenerally prone to indulge the former. Napo-\nleon Bonaparte believed on the presiding star\not his destiny; and many of the literary circle\nthat surrounded the \"philosophical\" king,\nFrederick the Great, while they derid~ the\ntruths of revelation, could yet perpetrate such\nfollies as those which are recorded in the follow-\ning extract. \" Lanethrie, an avowed atheist,\nused to make the sign of the cross if it thun-\ndered.

Others were\nthe dupes of fortune-tellers, and fhll half of\nthe court believed that a woman, all in white,\nappeared in one of the apartments of the castle,\nholding in her hands a large broon1, with\nwhich she swept the room when any of the\nroyal family were about to die. Several per-\nsons of distinction, occupying high places under\ngovernment, were duped by a person who pre-\ntended to have the power of intercourse with\nevil spirits so as to discover hidden treasure.\nThey even went the length of offering sacrifices\nto the devil, and procured at a great cost, as an\nacceptable offering, a goat which had not a\nsingle hair that was not black. Such are the\ninconsistencies of infidelity, and such are the\naberrations into which men are seduced, when,\nfor the delusions of their imaginations, they\nforsake the word of the living God.\"\nIn proportion as we recede towards the\ninfancy of ~ociety, especially where Divine\nrevelation has not poured its light upon the\nmind, we find the passion for the unseen un-\ngovernable and dangerous, and early hjstory is\ncrowded thick with portents, many of \u00b7which\nmay have originally possessed some conce~led\nfoundation, though, as they meet our eye, they\nare absolutely mythological and untrue. ,v\ne\nwill not, however, venture on the subject ante-\nrior to the date of modern history. The reader\nof the Old English Chronicles will be familiar\nwith numerous exemplifications of this credu-\nlous taste. The history (as it is called) of\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nVillPYRES. 63\nGeoffrey of Monmouth, abounds with incidents\nof this fabulous character.\nAmong the superstitions which paganism\ntransmitted to nominal Christians, was one of\nwhich scarcely any traces are now extant,\nthough in its day it exerted a horrifying influ-\nence. It was known under the name of Vam-\npyrism. A vampyre was represented as a dead\nman, quickened by magical processes into\nsupernatural life, which was sustained by prey-\ning upon the bodies of the dead. The Greek\nChristians appear to have beEln specially\naddicted to this delusion, and in various coun-\ntries of Europe, as in Bohemia and Hungary,\nsuch superstitions were prevalent even during\nthe last century. 'To such an extent did\ncredulity on this subject prevail, that not only\nwere vampyres imagined in every district, but\nassemblies of soldiers and ecclesiastics gravely\nmet to deliberate ho,v the enormity could be\nstayed. One mode of discovering a vampyre\nwas to pace a jet-black horse up and down the\nchurchyard between the graves. If the animal\nturned restive, and refused to proceed, it was\nconcluded that a vampyre existed somewhere in\nthe vicinity.\n'fhe process of ascertaining the innocence or\nguilt of an accused person by the trial of ordeal\nis of great antiquity. The followers of Zoroas-\ntev the Hindoos, and the Tartars, alike prac-\ntised it. It has been already shown, in one of\nthe volu1nes of the Monthly Series, how the\nhun1anbody may be rendered capablr ofresisting\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f64: REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nthe clfects of intense heat.\u2022 Such preparations\nwere well known to the ancients, and to those who\nlived in the dark ages. Accused persons often\nhandled red-hot iron without sustaining injury.\nHarold, king of Norway, in order to prove his\ntitle to the crown, walked over metal in this\nstate unscathed. Popon, to convince the Danes\nof the truth of Christianity, (a wretched proof\nof so important a theore1n,) put his naked arm\ninto a gauntlet heated to a white heat, and\ndrew it forth entirely sound. At Dydmo-\ntheque, in France, a wife, suspected by her\nhusband, lifted a bar of red-hot iron, which she\ncarried three times round a chair. She then\ndropped the iron on the chair, which was\ninstantly in a blaze. The husband was satis-\nfied ; but the wife declared to the bishop that\nshe was, nevertheless, guilty. In such instances\nthere can be no doubt of a familiarity with cer-\ntain secret~ known only to the initiated.\nUnder the Anglo-Saxon government of these\nislands, the imperfection of knowledge in the use\nof circumstantial evidence rendered such trials\nof frequent occurrence. The principal ordeals\nwere two-by water and by fire. li the trial\nwas by the former, a caldron of water was\nmade to boil in some part of a churcn, varying\nin depth according to the presumed guilt of the\naccused persQn. A heavy weight was then\nplaced within the caldron, to be drawn out. by\nthe prisoner with his arm bare.

If, at the expiration\nof that\u00b7 time, the limb was healed, the accused\nperson was deemed innocent; if otherwise, he\nwas punished as unquestionably guilty. The\ncorresponding ordeal was similar. A red-hot\npiece of iron being produced, was to be liftecl\nby the hands of the accused, who was required\nto take three prescribed steps whilst holding it.\nThe band was then bound up and sealed as\nbefore. . It is evident that such .cases afforded\nmuch opportunity for_connivanceand collusion,\nand that the interested or party prejudices of\nthe judges would materially modify the results.\nMany other ordeals are n1entioned by various\nauthors. At St. Sane, in Bretagne, was an iron\ncollar, which, bound round the neck, left (it ,vas\nsaid) the innocent uninjured, but strangled the\nguilty. The action of the collar was regulated,\nin all probability, by the opinion the operator\nmight have of the merits of the case before\nhim.\n. Credulity ~as, however, found no more ex-\ntensive field for the exercise of its powers, than\nthat which is associated with the idea of forms\nfrom another world. What terrors have not\nbeen excited, what idle and worthless volumes\nhave not been written, on this engrossing\ntheme ? . The subject is too prolific to receive\nin these pages more than a very epiton1ized\nnotice. \u00b7 It is unnecessary to analyse the\naccounts given of such appearances in the\npages of Holy Scripture. We have no reason to\ne~pect, in the ordinary government of the world\nDi itiz by\ng\n0\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n66 REMAnKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nby the providence of God, those manifestatiol)s\nwhich, in his wisdom, he deemed necessary\nunder a dispensation attended by miracles.\n'fhat such appearances have been, is no proof\nthat such things now are, any more than the\nfact that miraculous operations once took place\nis an argument for believing in their now daily\nrecurrence. Such appearances in modem times\nwill, it is evident, depend for their frequency\nvery greatly on the degree of popular credulity\nwhich may be prevalent. In certain states of\nmind, the unexplained passes readily into the\nsupernatural or even into the terrific.\nIt would be clearly impossible to undertake\nthe elucidation of every occurrence which seems\nto fa.vour the belief of this superstition. Yet\nthe explanation of a few cases may afford a\nlight by which to estimate the force of others\nyet involved in n1ystery.\nThat some of these alleged cases are the\nsimple effect of error or misapprehension is\nwhat will be denied by no judicious inquirer.\nA friend of the writer told him the following\nincident:-\nHe had been kept out by some business far\nbeyond his usual hour, and was returning home\nin very early morning, at a time when objects\nwere indistinctly seen, and when the mind, it\nmay be added, overstrained by undue exertion,\nis in a condition very favourable for the re-\nception of ideas of the supernatural. His path\nlay by a churchyard. Just as he reached it,\nhe saw, though indistinctly, a white figure\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fGHOSTS. 67\nslowly moving to and fro close to its precincts.\nIf, alarmed by terror, he had fled from the\nspot, his tale might have added a new item to\nthe catalogue of spectral appearances. But he\nwent on, and as he drew nearer, he ascertained\nthat the supposed apparition was only the\ninhabitant of a cottage hard by the church,\nwho, unable to sleep, and half-undressed, was\ntaking an airing, certainly at a very unseason-\nable, and, as it would have proved to most, at\na very uncomfortable hour in the morning.\nThe following is the narration of a Newcastle\nsea-captain : \"His cook,'' he said, \" chanced\nto die upon his passage homeward. This\nhonest fellow, having bad one of his legs a little\nshorter than the other, used to walk in that\nway which our vulgar idiom calls with an\nup and a down. A few nights after his body\nhad been committed to the deep, our captain\nwas alarmed by his mate with an account that\nthe cook was walking before the ship, and that\nall hands were on deck to see him. The\ncaptain, angry at being disturbed in his sleep,\nordered them to let him alone, and try whith,\nthe ship or he, should get first to Ne,vcastle.\nBut turning out on further importunity, he\nconfessed that he had like to have caught the\ncontagion; for, on seeing something move in a\n,vay so similar to that which the cook was\n\" wont to do, and withal having a cap on so like\nthat which he was used to wear, he verily\nthought that there was more in the report than\nhe was at first willing to believe.

Con1pslled to do\nthis himself, he found, on a nearer approach,\nthat the ridiculous cause of all their terror ,vas\npart of a main-top, the remains of some wreck\nfloating before then1.\"\u2022\nThere is something to be learned from the\nfollowing conversation between Dr. Fowler, a\nformer bishop of Gloucester, a great believer in\nthe supernatural, and ]Hr. Justice Powell, who\nhad less credulity. The latter one day told the\nformer that we had now ocular demonstration\nto convince him of the existence of ghosts.\n'fhe bishop congratulated him on his-discovery\nvf the truth, and the justice told how, as he\nlay in bed one night, he heard something con1e\nup stairs and stalk towards his room. \" I\ndrew,\" said he \"n1y curtain, and saw a faint\nglimmering of light enter my chamber.\" \" Of\na blue colour, no doubt,\" said the bishop. \"Of\na pale blue,\" answers the justice; \"the light\nwas followed by a tall, meagre, and stern per-\nsonage, who seemed about seventy, in a long,\ndangling gown, bound round with a leathern\ngirdle, his face wrinkled, and of a dark sable\nhue.\" \" .And did you not speak to it?\" inter-\nrupted the bishop. \"l\\ily lord, I did speak to\nit.\" \"And what answer, lir. Justice?\" \" l\\Iy\nlord, the answer was, that he was the watchman\nof the night, and came to give n1e notice that\nhe had found the street door open1\nand that\n\u2022 Hibbert.\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fGHOSTS. 69\nunless I rose and sl1ut it, I might chance to be\nrobbed befo.re break of day.\"\n. After the marringe of ifr. Matthews, a come-\ndian, he took lodgings in York, in a room\nwhich had been formerly occupied by Sterne,\nbut which was reported to be haunted, though\nthe ghost was only to be heard in the best bed-\nroom. When night catne, and just as the\nMinster clock struck twelve, the sleepers were\nawaked by three blows, asthey believed,upon\ntheir heads. Nothing, however, appeared wl1ich\nmight afford a clue to the explanation ; but\nevery night, precisely at the sa1ne witching\nhour, the same knocks ,vere repeated. The\npair became uneasy, but the cheapness of the\nlodgings still tempted .them to remain. At\nlength the noises suddenly ceased, and were\nnever renewed. It may be easily supposed\nthat the silence was almost as awful as the\nsounds. Some weeks after this, as Matthews\nand his wife were sitting in a room in company\nwith a widow, the conversation turned on\nthe Stonegate ghost. As a Mrs. Long, who\nwas present, heard it, she said, \" Why, that was\n1ny dear Billy Long I'' In the issue, it ap-\npeared that her husband, a bed-ridden 1nan,\nlodging in the adjoining house to Matthews,\nwas much annoyed through fear of thieves,\nespecially dreading that they should come from\nbehind his bed. As he was remarkable for his\nlove of punctuality, he had been accust.omed,\njust as the Minster clock struck twelve, to deal\nthree heavy blow\u00b7s upon the arras which hung\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n__..\n\fDi itiz by\n70 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nbehind his .pillow. His death -was followed, ot\ncourse, by a cessation of the sounds.\nSir Walter Scott, in his \" Letters on Demo-\nnology and Witchcraft,\" relates the following\noccurrence, which we imagine refers to himself\nand to the supposed apparition of his deceased\nfriend, lord Byron:-\n\" Not Ion~ after the death of a certain illus-\ntrious poet, who had filled,when living, a great\nstation in the eye of the public, a literary friend,\nto whom the deceased had been well known,\nwas engaged, during the darkening twilight of\nan autumn evening, in perusing one of the\npublications which professed to detail the habits\nand opinions of the distinguished individual\nwho wasno,vno more...\u2022 A visitor was sitting\nin the apartment who was engaged in reading.\nTheir sitting-room opened into an entrance hall;\nrather fantastically fitted up with articles of\narmour, wild animals, and the like.

He\nstopped for a single moment, so as to notice the\n,vonderful accuracy with which fancy had im-\npressed on his bodily eye the peculiarities of\ndress and posture of the illustrious poet.

These were merely a\nscreen, occupied by great coats, shawls, plaids,\nand such 9ther articles as are usually found in\na country entrance hall. The spectator re-\nturned to the spot from which he had seen the\nillusion, and endeavoured with all his power to\nrecall the itnage which had been so singularly\nvivid. But this was beyond his capacity ; and\nthe person who had witnessed the apparition,\nor, more properly, whose excited state had been\nthe means of raising it, bad only to return, and\ntell the young friend he had left under what\na striking hallucination be had for a moment\nlaboured.\"\nThe narration which follows presents a strik-\ning case in illustration of our subject:-\nA club of persons in the town of Plymouth\nwas accustomed to meet during the sun11ner\nmonths in a secluded summer-house, accessible\nto many of the members by a pass-key. On\noccasion of one of its meetings, the president for\nthe evening was taken dangerously ill, and, as\na mark of respect, the chair designed for him\nwas left unoccupied. His absence naturally led\nto a conversation on the talents and character\nof the absentee. Whilst the membe1\u00b7s were\nthus speaking, the figure of the president entered\nthe room. It was ghastly pale, and clothed in\nwhite. Gliding to the vacant chair, it lifted the\nempty glass before him, bowed to the company,\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n72 REMARKABLEDELUSIONS.\nand put it to his lips-then, in dead silence,\u00b7\ndisappeared as it had entered. The effect on\nthe club was horrifying. After remaining for\nson1etime together conversing on this appalling\nincident, two of the numher went to the house .\nof the president, and found him dead.\nLong after the news of the super~atural -\nvisitation had been circulated and obtained an\nawful credence, it ,vas discovered that the de-\nceased man, immediately before his death, and\nwhilst the nurse appointed to watch by bis\nbed-side was asleep, had, in a fit of delirium,\nactually gone to the summer-house, and had\nonly returned to his own bed to die. If that\nexplanation had been wanting, the whole scene,\nwitnessed as it was by many spectators at once,\nn1ight have passed for one of_the best attested\nghost stories on record.\nThe phenomenon oftl1espectre oftheBrocken,\na range ofmountains in Hanover,may be already\nfamiliar to many of our readers.

Some monks availed them-\nselves thus of the superstitions of one of the,\nkings of France, St. Louis. The king had\nexpressed a wish to ha,,e a community of the\nmonks of St. Bruno settled near Paris. These\nmonks fixed a longing eye upon the ancient\npalace of Vauvert, which appeared exactly to\naccord with their notions ofa desirable residence.\nVauvert immediately became haunted; sounds\nissued from -it at night; and dancing light.s,\nclanking chains, dreadful howlings, and other\nfrightful phenomena, alar1ued its neighbours.\n'l'hese were succeeded by a spectral form in\ngreen, with a beard of white, ,vhich was nightly\n. seen in one of the palace windows. The monks\ntold the tale to the king, and declared that if\nthey were a1lowed to occupy the palace, the\nspectres should soon be exterminated. 1'he\nking conveyed to them the property, the ghosts\ndisappeared, the noises were heard no more,\nand the monks of St. Bruno enjoyed the advan-\ntages of a quiet residence.\nDi itiz by\nThe writer was not long since at Linlithgow,\na celebrated palace of the former kings, or\nrather queens, of Scotland, through whose\ndeserted and fire-blasted walls the wind now\nsweeps unchecked.

He seemed to\nbe a man of two-and-fifty years, with a great\npikestaff in his hand, and came first forward\namong the lords, crying and speiring (asking)\nfor the king, saying he desired to speak with\nhim. While, at the last, he came where the\nking was sitting in the desk at his prayers; but\nwhen he saw the king, he made him little\nreverence or salutation, but leaned down gruffly\non the desk before him, and said to him in this\nmanner, as after follows: ' Sir king, my mother\nbath sent me to you, desiring you not to pass\nat this time where you are purposed, for if\nthou doest, thou wilt not farewell in thy journey,\nnor none that passeth with thee.'\" The ap-\nparition then, after a few niore remonstrances,\ndisappeared. But so1ne of the accounts describe\nit as disappearing towards the queen's apart-\nments.

During the early\npart of the last century, some inhabitants of\nDorking entertained the notion that a ghost\n,valked at a certain place in their neighbou;r-\nhood, and that a recently deceased lady was to\nbe seen hovering about her late dwelling with\na clattering noise, and in the night ,valking\nthrough the fields with a candle, which the\nhighest winds did not extinguish. The report\ngreatly \u00b7alarmed the surrounding inhabitants.\nIn the end, it proved to be only the trick of\nsome idle, but wicked boys, belonging to a\nboarding-school hard by.\nThe incident is related by Defoe, in his\n\u00b7 \"flistory of Apparitions.\" If, as is not impro-\nbable from his manner of relating the story, he\n\"'as himself concerned in this wicked ~rick, it\nmight prepare the way for a much n1ore repre-\nhensible appeal to superstitious minds perpe-\ntrated by him in his later years.

He mentions the case of a\nyoung clergyman, named Billing, who had dis-\ncovered a dead body by a certain luminous\nappearance above the spot. The peculiar form\nhe gave to it was probably, however, only the\neffect of his own imagination. Billing said, that\nwhenever he went near a grave-yard he always\nobserved many similar appearances. Though\nthe fact is not familiar to most persons, no\n, doubt can exist that a corpse is, as the professor\ndescribes it, \" a field for abundant che1nical\nchanges, decomposition, fermentation, putrefac-\ntion, gasification, and general play of affinities ;''\nnor is there any improbability in the belief,\nthat extremely sensitive constitutions may be\nable to discern a lambent fla1ne accon1panying\ntl1isaction, though altogether undiscoverable by\nthe ordinary observer. To put the matter to\nthe proof, professor Gregory induced a young\nlady, who possessed this sensitiveness in a high\ndegree, to accompany him to a churchyard.\nThis lady saw on one of the graves an ap-\npearance of phosphoric light-a kind of \"deli-\ncate breathing flame'' marking its whole\nlength; and its repet.ition, in a weakened form,\non an adjacent grave.

One incident, related by\na late writer, will sufficiently illustrate this\ndivision of our treatise:-\n\" It was about the eventful year 1800,\" says\nthe narrator, '' when the emperor Paul laid his\nill-judged embargo on British trade, that my\nfriend, on a journey to London, found himself\nin company in the mail-coach with a seafaring\nman, of middle age and respectable appearance,\nwho announced himself as a master of a vessel\nin the Baltic trade, and sufferer by the e1n-\nbargo. In the course of the desultory conver-\nsation which takes place on such occasions, the\nseaman observed, in compliance with a common\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fGIIOSTS. 83\nsuperstition, ' I wish \u00b7we may have good luck\non our voyage-there is a magpie.' ' And why\nshould that be unlucky ?' said my friend. ' I\ncannot tell you that,' replied the sailor; ' but all\nthe world agrees that one magpie bodes ill-luck,\ntwo are not so bad, but three are the worst\nof all. I never saw three magpies but twice,\nand once I had near lost my vessel, and the\nsecond I fell from my horse and was hurt.' This\nconversation led my friend to observe, that he\nsupposed he believed also in ghosts, since he\ncredited such auguries; ' And if I do,' said the\nsailor, ' I may have my own reasons for doing\nso ;' and he spoke this in a deep and serious\nmanner, in1plying that he felt deeply what he\nwas saying. On being further urged, he con-\nfessed that, if he could believe his own eyes,\nthere was one ghost at least which he had seen\nrepeatedly. He then told his story as I now\nrelate it:-\nDi itiz by\n\" Our mariner had in his youth gone mate\nof a slave vessel from Liverpool, of which town\nhe seemed to be a native. The captain of the\nvessel was a man of a variable temper, some-\ntimes kind and courteous to his men, but sub-\nject to fits of humour, dislike, and passion,\nduring which he ,vas very violent, tyrannical,\nand cruel. He took a particular dislike to one\nsailor on board, an elderly man. He seldom\nspoke to this person without threats and abuse,\n,vhich the old man, with the license which\nsailors take in merchant vessels, was very\napt toreturn. On one occasion, the latter\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n84 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nappeared slow in getti~g out on the yard to hancl\na sail. The captain, according to custom, abused\nthe seaman as leaving his duty to other people.\nThe man made a saucy answer, almost amount-\ning to mutiny, on which, in a towering passion,\nthe captain ran down to his cabin, and returned\nwith a blunderbuss loaded with slugs, with\nwhich he took a deliberate aim at the supp~sed\nmutineer, fired, and mortally wounded him.\nThe man was handed down from the yard and\nstretched on the deck, evidently dying. I-Ie\nfixed his \u00b7eyes on the captain, and saicl, ' Sir,\nyou have done for \u00b7me, but I will never leave\nyou.'\n\" The captain pledged his crew to silence.\nBut after a time, the mate found them impressed\nwith the idea, not unnatural in their situation,\nthat the ghost of the dead man appeared among\nthem when they had a spell of duty, especially ir\na sail was to be handed, on which occasion the\nspectre was sure to be out upon the yard before\nany of the crew. The narrator had seen this\napparition himself repeatedly-he believed the\ncaptain also saw it, but he took no notice of it\nfor some time, and the crew, terrified at the\nviolent temper of the man, dared not call his\nattention to it. Thus, they held on their course\nhome,vard with great fear and anxiety.\n\"At length the captain invited the mate to\ngo down into the cabin with him. In this\ninterview he assumed a very grave and serious\naspect. ' I need not tell you, Jack,' he said,\n'what sort of hand we have got on board with\ng\n. -\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nGHOSTS. 85\nus ; he told me he would \u00b7never leave n1e,and\nhe has kept his word.

I am determined to bear it no\nlonger, and I have resolved to leave you.'\n\" The mate replied, that his leaving the\nvessel ,vhile out of sight of any land was\nimpossible. He advised that, if the captain\napprehended any bad consequences from what\nhad happened, he should run for the west of\nFrance or Ireland, and there go ashore, and\nleave him, the mate, to carry the vessel\ninto Liverpool. The captain only shook his\nhead gloomily, and reiterated his determination\nto leave the ship. At this moment, the mate\nwas called to the deck for some purpose er\nother, and the instant he got up the companion\nladder he heard a splash in the water, and\nlooking over the ship's side, s~w that the\ncaptain had thrown himself into the sea from the\nquarter gallery, and was running astern at the\nrate of six knots an hour. When just about to\nsink, he seemed to make a last exertion, sprang\nhalf out of the water, and clasped his hands\ntowards the mate, calling, ' Ah l he is with me\nnow !' and then ..\n(tank to be seen no more.\"\nSupposing the conversation to have been accu-\nrately reporw<l, 1t is easy to imagine how the\nsuperstition so comn1on among sailors should\nhave given rise to their belief in the re-appear-\nance of their deceased comrade.

An awful illus-\ntration does it present of a poet's lines :-\n\" Guilt still appals,andconscience, ne'er asleep,\nWounds with incesaant strokes, not loud but deep;\nWhile the vexed mind, its own tormentor, pliea\nA scorpion scourge unseen by human eyes.,,\nSimilar instances to the above, magnified as\nthey would naturally be by the unthinking\nand credulous, have often \u00b7Jaid the foundations\nof what have been regarded as incontrovertible\nghost stories. The impression made by such\nnarrations on minds of a certain order is\nextremely enervating and deeply injurious.\nWithout entering upon the question as to the\npossibility of such supernatural manifestations,\n(a question which in this work we prefer to\nwaive,) we must regard the moral effects by\nwhich similar alleged appearances are attended\nas by no means such as to constitute an argu-\nment for the probability of their frequent\noccurrence, for the most credulous are certainly\nnot those on whom apprehensions in regard to\nspiritual being exert the most salutary practical\ninfluence. The objects supposed to be accom-\nplished by similar visitations are usually .so\ntrivial and even contemptible, as by no 1neans\nto harmonize with the wisdom which ever\nattends on Divine interpositions. When, too, it\nis remembered in ho,v many minds thei:e\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDREAMS. 87\nexists a strong predisposition to believe without\nadequate evidence, and on how many 1nore a\ndiseased iu1agination exerts an influence posi-\ntiv-ely disastrous, sufficient reasons exist why\nwe should be unusually slow in receiving such\nwonders. They demand an an1ount of proof\nwhich only the strongest evidence can afford.\nDi itiz by\nIt is not wonderful if, an1ong the various\ndelusions which have taken possession of the\nhuman mind, superstitions connected with\ndreams should have prevailed extensively. As\ndreaming was one of the modes by which\nDivine and prophetical communications ,vere\nmade in ancient days from God to his creatures,\nwe can scarcely wonder that a supernatural\ncharacter in dreams should be supposed to\nhave survived the period in which they were\nmanifestly employed for the above purposes.\n'fhere is something, also, so distinctive in the\nsensations themselves-such a. mixture of the\nnovel with the familiar-and so vivid and\napparently real are the pictures on which the\neye of the mind rests, as to render the pheno-\nmena of dreaming altogether peculiar. The\nsubject has accordingly been regarded with\nawful interest ; and though dreams are in\nordinary cases nothing more than new com-\nbinations of previously existing ideas, and\ntherefore reflections of the past rather than\nintimations of the future, they have been in\nalmost all ages identified with Divine influence.\nYet dreams which leave behind them the\nstrongest itnpressions, indicate only some dis-\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n88 RE.MARK.ABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nturbance of the physical system, and are rather\nproofs of the need of medical treatment than\nprophecies of events to come.\n]?reams are not, as they may be supposed\nto be, absolutely uncontrollable. Dr. Beattie\nrelates one of his dreams, in which he supposed\nhimself to be in a situation of the utmost\n.danger on the parapet of a high bridge. He\npossessed, however, sufficient consciousness to\nbe aware that this position was not altogether\nreal, and to disabuse himself of the delusion,\nhe resolved to precipitate himself from the emi-\nnence, in order to destroy the uncomfortable\nsensations of which he was conscious. Dr. Reid,\nalso, who, during a certain period of his life,\nwas, whilst asleep, oppressed by successions of\npainful imagery, took a decided course to divest\nhimself of the recurrent terrors. Before he\nslept, he endeavoured to impress upon his\nmind the conviction that Jiis dangers would be\naltogether imaginary, and when the moment of\nillusion came, he attempted to bring on the\ncrisis which he seemed instinctively to dread.\nHe thus. gradual1y dispossessed himself of the\nphantasms, and regained ease and tranquillity.\nThat dreams have sometimes remarkably\ncorresponded with subsequent facts, it would be\nuseless, and more than useless, to deny. Yet it\ndoes not thence follow that such dreams have\nbeen supernatural. Such is the nature of the\nassociation of ideas in the human mind, that a\nforgotten event will sometimes only be recalled\nby some circumstance ,\u2022rhich stood in very near\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDREAMS. 89\nrelation to it, not till then will the event itself\noccur to the memory.

Such\noccurrences are not unusual, and ,vhen applied\nto dreams, may explain a certain class of phe-\nnomena. which would be otherwise inex-\nplicable.\n\" A gentleman of the law in Edinburgh bad\nmislaid an important paper connected with the\nconveyance of a property which was to be settled\non a particular day.

But\nthe subject is altogether so wide and difficult,\nthat we can only give to it in these pages\na transient reference.\nThe absurd oracles by which dreams are\nprofessedly interpreted would be scarcely wor-\nthy of a moment's notice, were it not that they\nfrequently delude the unwary and unstable.\nThe following are specimens :-To dream you\nsee a stack of corn burned signifies famine and\nmortality.-To dream of little rain and drops of\n,vater is good for ploughmen.-'f o take flies\nsignifies wrong and injury, etc., etc. But these\nare by no means the worst specimens ; and to\nquote more would be a task equally insuffer-\nable to the writer, and uninteresting (we hope)\nto the reader. \\Ve would fain believe that the\ntaste for the little books which feed such\nfrivolous and often depraved fancies is fast\npassing a,vay.\nShould any of our readers entertain the\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nDREAMS. - 91\nopinion; that on the subject which we have been\ndiscussing \"it is necessary to caution against\nundue scepticism as well as against undue\ncredulity ,\"-instead of engaging in unprofitable\ncontroversy, we would rather draw a~tention to\nthe practical lessons which are deducible from\nthe topic under examination. The grounds on\nwhich the Christian will withhold his belief as\nto the suspension of the laws of nature in cases\nsimilar to those adduced above, will\u00b7 entirely\ndiffer fr01n those adopted by the unbeliever.\nWhile the latter ignorantly dreams that these\nlaws cannot be suspended, the other will\nren1ember that the same Bfling who ordained\nthem can at any time, when his wisdom sees\nfit, temporarily interrupt their action. He will\nreasonably expect, however, that the occasions\nwhen the laws of nature shall be so suspended\nwill be such as to demand miraculous interpo-\nsition, and not minister merely, to credulity\nGod, it is true, might send a messenger from\nthe dead to warn a sinner of his guilt; but while\n~Ioses and the prophets remain, we have no\nSeri ptural grounds to expect such a course.

The instinctive tendencies of the\n1nind towards religion are shown in nothing\n1nore than in the fact, that errors of a 1\u00b7eligious\ntype are the most deeply rooted of all which\npossess the mind of man. 'fhe spirit which the\ngospel breathes is emphatically a \"spirit of\nlove.\" It was in the love of God to fallen men\nthat the scheme of redemption originated. Love\nwas the chief feature of the Saviour's cha-\nracter while on earth, and love is the temper\nthat should distinguish his followers. Among\nnominal professors in all ages, .however, a car-\nnal spirit, clothing itself under the disguise\nof zeal for the honour of God, has often pre~\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n94: REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nvailed, manifesting itself in evil and bitter\nfruits. Even real Christians have too often,\nfrom unwatchfulness, been betrayed into the\nsame spirit, and have exchanged the meekness\nand gentleness of their Divine Pattern for the\ngratification of unlovely and unholy tempers.\nTo causes such as these, acting in combination\nwith the ign(?rance peculiar to the times, and\nerroneous interpretations of the word of God,\nmust, we fear, be largely attributed many of\nthe dark passages which stain the annals of this\nand other European countries in connexion\nwith the subject of witchcraft.\nThat laws were enacted against \u00b7witchcraft\nby the book of God is n1ost clear ; but tl1eir\nenactment would have been equally important\nand necessary whether witchcraft ,vere a fallacy\nor a reality. In the former case, it would,\nby its assumption of power belonging to the\nDivinity alone-by its professed alliance with\ninfluences not those of the Holy One-by its\nassociation with crimes which disgrace and de-\ngrade-and by its establishment oyer mind of\nan empire always base and disastrous, have\nconstituted a crime sufficient to give rise to\nthe command from God, '' Thou shalt not\nsuffer a witch to live.\" The visible association\nof witchcraft with all that is criminal in human\nhistory is, apart fron1 verbal criticism, a suffi-\ncient explanation of the solemn injunction ;\nwhile it is enough that God saw fit to give\nt.liis command to the Jews. The professed\nwitch was son1etimes a pander to evil, often\no. poisoner, always a criminal. She was\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fWITCHCRAFT. 96\nresorted tu by the basest of society-the dark\nand desperate in character and habits. No form\nof polity, perhaps, could, in that age, with im-\npunity tolerate such beings, and least of all\nthat economy which provided for the external\npurity of the chosen nation with such jealous\ncare. Nor can there be any doubt that n1any\nof the appearances related by the consulters ot\nwitches were occasioned by the intoxicating\nand often poisonous potions or perfumes which\nthey administered.\nBut whether the command quoted above be\naddressed to the Gentile equally with the Jew,\nor whether the cases of supposed witchcraft\n,vere those which \u00b7possessed proof enough to\nbring them under the letter of the Divine\ncommand, are questions which materially affect\nthe whole subject. There is abundant evidence\nthat the allegation of a compact with the evil\none, by which the minds of men were so ex-\ntensively influenced a hundred years ago, were\ndestitute of that proof which would entitle them\nto respect and regard.\nNothing can be more clear than that a large\nproportion of the ancient magical practices\narose fro1n the possession of physical secrets,\nkno,vn only to the initiated. The repeated\nstories respecting books, and their use in magi-\ncal incantations, confirm this conclusion. These\nbooks, though couched in mysterious and hiero-\n. glyphic characters, contained, in fact, experi-\nments in natural philosophy ; their contents\nbeing,probably, not very dissimilar from those\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n96 REMAUKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nnow perused by the first students of natural\nphenomena. A name for magical power being\nonce gained, the greatest pains were taken to\nkeep up the reputation. Sinan Raschid-Eddin,\nchief of the Ishmaelites of Syria, apparently\nperformed the miracle of making a decapitated\nhead speak. How was it managed ? 'l'he\nexplanation is very simple. A large bole was\ndug in the ground, into which the body of a\npupil was thrust, and the head appearing above\nground, was surrounded by a dish of bronze,\nhaving the appearance of a basin of _blood.\nWhen the poor victim had, as by previous\nagreement, delivered the message he was in-\n&tructed to convey, he was killed to preserve\nthe secret.\nIn these pretend~ magical appearances,\nmany arts, perfectly familiar in our day, were\nused with great sec:resy. Ventriloquism was,\ndoubtless, extensively employed. Auton1ata.\nwere not infrequent ; jugglery very comn1on;\nburning mirrors and telegraphs seem to have\nbeen also familiar. Optics, including the\nmagic lantern and camera obscura, interposed\ntheir illusions; whilst the then ascertained\ndiscoveries of chemistry, hydrostatics, an4\nacoustics, conspired to delude the ignorant\nspectator. Nor must it be forgo~ten that drugs,\nodours, and unguents, were often freely used in\npreparing the inquirer for the wonders to be\nrevealed to him.\nIt would be impossible, within a brief com-\npass, to convey to the reader a due notion or\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fWITCHCRAFT. 97\nthe various ranks and degrees of demons once\nsupposed to exert a mysterious influence. The\nbeing who was supposed to preside over witch-\ncraft. was no fallen archangel, \" great, though\nruined,\" full of the pride by which he fell, but a\nstrange compound of wickedness and vulgarity-\na trickster-a cheat-an idle vagrant-a low\nbuffoon-totally unlike that powerful, though\nmalignant b~ng, represented in the Scripture\nas \" the prince of the power of the air-the\nspirit that now worketh in the children of dis- \u00b7\nobedience.\" In conceiving of such a being as\nthat represented by the believers in witchcraft,\nthe spiritual character of sin is entirely lost,\nthe nature of the human soul infinitely de\u2022\ngraded, and all those solemn warnings neutral\u2022\nized by which Scripture has cautioned us to\nwatch against the devices ofSatan, as a being\nfull of malignity and subtlety. Some of the\nlegendary tales of St. Anthony, or those of\nNostradamus, (who, having made himself over\nto the devil's influence, in case of his being\nburied in or out of the church, escaped the\nalternative by giving directions that he should\nbe interred in a chul'ch wa11,) are degrading\nto the religion, the sacred name of which\nsheltered such profanations. It is a trite\nremark, that a despised enemy is seldom a\ndreaded one ; and these ludicrous distortions\nof the nature and character of the great enemy\nof souls must, doubtless, be ranked as among\ndevices of his own fostering, by which he, who\nwas\na deceiver from the beginning, seeks to\nDi itiz by\ng\nD\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n98\n.\nnEMAFKABLEDELUSIONS.\ndelude his victims into forgetfulness of their\ndanger.\nOther absurdities followed in the wake of\nthis leading one. The air swarmed with\ndemons, whose antic tricks,though the relation\nof them proyokes modern disdain, were sources\nof real terror to om\u00b7 forefathers. Spainboasted\nof a school of witchcraft, where the malignant\narts, interdicted by the church, were eagerly\npursued. It is inconceivable what a succession\nof laws were directed against this imaginary\ncrime. The Anglo-Saxon decretals of Edward\nand Guthnun declare-\" If witches or diviners,\nperjurers or morth-workers, or foul, defiled, or\nnotorious adulteresses, be found anywhere\nwithin the land, let them be driven from the\ncountry and the people cleansed, or let them\ntotally perish within the country unless they\ndesist.\" Accusations of witchcraft were the\nmost serious charges preferred against the\nKnights 'femplars at the suppression of their\norder, and fifty-nine of these knights were for\nthis crime roasted in Paris before a slow fire.\nTill the fourteenth century, however, the\npunishment of witchcraft belonged rather to\nthe. secular than to the ecclesiastical power. It\nwas afterwards dealt out, by special accusation,\nagainst heretics. In 1406, Henry 1v.gave\ndirections to the bishop of Norwich to discover\nand destroy sorcerers. During the same\ncentury, charges of witchcraft were extensively\nbrought by political parties against their ad-\nversaries. We see this in the cases of the\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fWITCHCRAFT. 99\nduchess of Gloucester, (temp. Hen. vr.,) the\nduchess of Bedford, (temp. Hen. IV.,)and lord\nHastings and Jane Shore, (temp. Richard\nm.)\nThe heroism of Joan of Arc has been often\nrelated, and is well known. Prompted by heads\nmore cunning than her own, she yielded herself\nto the influence of a fallacious enthusiasm,\nwhich, at the time of the invasion of France by\nEngland, was rapidly imparted t,o others, and\nroused the flagging spirits ora depressed nation,\nthough it ended in Joan's miserable death.\nWhen captured by the English, she was accused\nof having attended nightly meetings of <;lemons\nnear Domprine. It was stated that she con-\nstantly carried about her person the magical\nplant called mandrake. Shewas declared to\npossess a miraculous sword, to employ charmed\nbanners, and to have seduced the king of\n.France and the duke of Bourbon by means of\nevil spirits. To these accusations the innocent,\nbut deluded young woman fell a victim, and\nwas burned for sorcery.\nIn the beginning of the fifteenth century, the\nburning of witches greatly increased, and it was\nconvenient for the Roman Catholics to charge\nthe Waldenses with the crime. During the next\ncentury, also, many suft'ered under this accusa- \u00b7 \u00b7\ntion. In 1515, five hundred persons were\nburned in Geneva under the name of witches,\nbut really for the crime of heresy. In 1524, a\nthousand persons suirered for the same offence\nin Como ; and one inquisitor alone boasted that\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nl UU REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nin the course of fifteen years he had destroyed\nnine hundred.\nThe glories of the Reformation in England\nwere considerably diminished by the severe\nlaws passed and executed by Protestants against\nthis imaginary oifence. A law of Elizabeth,\nin 1562, declared witchcraft; to be a capital\ncrime. Thirty-two years after this enactment\noccurred the case of the witches of Warboys,\nHunts. Its particulars were the following:-\nTwo families lived in ,varboys, those of sir\nSamuel Cromwell and of Mr. Throgmorton.\nOne of the daughters of the former, who had\nalready a great deal of credulity on the sub-\nject, and who was liable to fits, declared that\nwhen passing the cottage of mother Samuel,\n(an old and forbidding-looking woman,) she\n:fixed her eyes intently upon .her. She imme-\ndiately imagined herself bewitched, and her\nterror not only became contagious through all\nher family, but communicated itself to the\nneighbouring one of the Cromwells. The re-\nputed witch was seized and tormented, and,\nunder the provocation of her sufferings, she\nuttered an imprecation against her persecutors.\nLady Cromwell happened to die about this\nperiod, and the event was considered an un-\ndoubted consequence of mother Samuel's male-\ndiction, especially when it was remembered\nthat the deceased lady had often dreamed of a\nblack cat. She was now assailed by universal\nsuspicion, until she began to believe (an event\nnot in those days uncommon) that she herself\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fWITCHCRAFT. 101\nwas really guilty of the crimes with which she\nwas charged. Being in Mr. 'fhrogmorton's -~-\nhouse at a time when his daughter was in fits,\nthe old woman repeated an exorcism dictated\nto her. She and her family ,vere brought to ti-ial\nfor the bewitching of the young ladies, and for\ncausing the death of lady Crom,vell. When\nput to the torture, the mother repeated her\nacknowledgn1ents of witc~craft; her children,\nhowever, strenuously denied the charge ; but\nthey were all condemned to be burned, and were\nexecuted April 7th, 1598.\nThe peruser of the criminal trials of the Scot-\ntish judicature will ascertain that charges of\nwitchcraft occupy a considerable space in these\nannals. Janet, lady Glammis, was celebrated\nfor her personal beauty and her virtues. By\nthe death of lord Glammis she was left a widow\nwith one son. Her hand was subsequently\nsought by William Lyon, a relation of l1er first\nhusband. This man, when he saw the object of\nhis attention married to Archibald Campbell,\nbegan to regard her _with deadly hatred, and\naccused her ofthe treason ofendeavouring totake\naway \"king James v. his life by witchcraft.\"\nFor this\u00b7 crime she ,vas burned, amidst the\ngeneral sympathy of the people. At the same\nperiod, dean Thomas Fore), vicar of Dolour, ,vas\nsimilarly accused; his crime being that he bad\ntaught his parishioners the paternoster, the\ncreed, and the ten commandments in English,\n\" contraire to all oure acts that they suld knawe\nwhatthey say.\" The accused produced a copy\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n102 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nof the English Scriptures as his authority,\nwhich act was regarded as the strongest\u00b7 aggra-\nvation of his guilt. He was burned at the\nCastle Hill of Edinburgh.\u2022\n. The like accusation was brought against the\ncelebrated Scottish reformer, John Knox. The\ncharge, however, seems not to have been\nprosecuted.\nJames 1. of England took, whil~t in Scotland,\ngreat interest in the trial of witches. He often\nattended the criminal proceedings, and himself\nwrote a well-known book on the subject. One\nof t.he trials at which he was present was that\nof Gellie Duncan, Dr. Fian, and others, in 1591.\nGellie Duncan being put to the torture, confessed\nthat she had sold her soul to the devil, and\nthat on the occasion of the marriage of the king\nto the princess of Denmark, she had by sorcery\nraised the storm which endangered the life of\nthe royal pair. The tortures undergone by\nDr. Fian, who was tried at the same time for a\nsimilar offence, were excruciating. Though he\n,vas a man of infamous character, he resolutely\ndenied this imputation. The application of the\nboot caused him to swoon. Then, with returning\nconsciousness, he signed a paper, declaring\nhimself an accomplice with Gellie Duncan. He\nafterwards escaped from his prison, but was re-\ncaptured. When brought again before the\ncourt of justiciary, the king himself ordered his\ntorture, ,vhich was of the most cruel description.\nThat some of these persons actually meditated\ng\n* Pitcairn'\u2022 Scottish Criminal Trials.\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fWITCHCRAFT, 108\nthe king's death is not improbable. When the\njury delivered in their verdict they acquitted\none of the prisoners. But the king, extremely\ndispleased, compelled them to retract that part\nof their finding. Twenty-nine were sentenced,\nfirst to be hanged and then burned. But one\nof the number, Euphemia Macalgan, who was\nproved guilty of poisoning, and who had been,\nmoreover, a partisan of the notorious earl oi\nBothwell, was bound to a stake, and burned\n'.'quick to the death.\"\nInReginald Soot's \"Diacoverie of Witchcraft,\"\n(1584) wefind the following observations, which\nconsiderably elucidate some of the occurrences\nrelating to this subject: \" The sort of such as\nare said to be witches, are women which be\ncommonly old, lame, blear-eyed, pale, fowle,\nand full of wrinkles-poore, sullen, supersti-\ntious.\" The same author gives an acco1mt of\n\" the order of examjnation of witches by the\ninquisitors.\" This we must curtail. Suspected\nwomen must not be allowed to go home after\ntheir apprehension. Great persuasions must be\nused to induce others to accuse them. Im\u2022\nmunities must be largely promised to witches\nwho confess and accuse others. The children\nof witches must be attached, and if they be\ncraftily handled will confess against their own\nmothers. Witches must be examined \u00b7as sud-\ndenly as possible, and the inquisitor must begin\nwith smaller matters first, aoas to throw them\noiF their guard. The examiner must look\n1tedfutly into their eyes. They must be\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n104: REMARKABLEDELUSIONS.\nexamined of all accusations, presu\\Dptions, and\nfaults, at one instant. A witch must not be\nimprisoned alone. To secure confession, the\njudge must put on a pitiful countenance, saying\nthat it was not she, but the devil in her. If\nthe accused be hardened against comn1on tor-\ntures, an exquisitely cruel one ii to be adopt.ed.\nAt the time of the examination, a number of\ninstruments, grieves, manacles, and apparatus\nof torture must be exhibited before her eyes.\nIf the prisoner will not confess, the inquisitor\nmust declare that she has been accused by\nothers, and then perhaps she will confess out of\nrevenge. Presumptions and conjectures are\nsufficient proofs. A perjured person is a good\nand lawful witness. If a woman's child die, no\nmatter ho,v, witchcraft is to be presumed unless\nthe contrary be provecl. If the parents of a\nsuspected person be witches, it is a strong\npresumption that the children are so too. It\nis a vehement suspicion if the witch cannot\nweep at the time of her examination; and yet,\nBodin saith, that a witch may shed three drops\nout of her right eye. It is more than suspicion\n-it is evident proof-if a man or beast die\nsuddenly where a person accused of being a\nwitch bath been seen lately. Little children\nmay be exposed to the torture, etc. It\nwill not greatly surprise the reader, if, amidst\nthis apparatus of all kinds of torture, bodily and\nmental, it has been calculated that, during a\nperiod of thirty-nine years, \u00b7in the six-\nteenth century, the average number of annual\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fWITCIICRAJT. 105\nexecutions for this crime, in Scotland alone,\namounted to two hundred.\nNor can it be regarded as marvellous, if, thus\ntreated, infirm or semi-insane persons often\nmade \" confessions\" of the imputed crimes. \" I\nwent once,\" says sir George Mackenzie,\" when\nI was justice depute, to eJramine some women\nthat had confessed judicially, and one of them\nwho was a sickly creature told me, under\nsecresie, that she had not confessed because she\nwas guilty, but, being a poor creature who\nwrought for her meat, and being defamed for a\nwitch, she knew she would starve; for no person\nhereafter would give her food and lodging, and\nthat all men would beat her and set dogs at her,\nand that therefore she desired to be out of the\nworld.\" It is related by one who was himself\na believer in witchcraft, that another forlorn\ncreature, when about to be led to the stake,\ndeclared,\" I am as free of witchcraft as any\nchild; but being delated by a malicious wo-\nman, and put in prison under the name of a\nwitch, disowned by my husband and friends,\nand seeing no ground of hope of ever coming\nout again, I made up that confession to de-\nstroy my own life, being weary of it, and\nchoosing rather to die than live.~' Many\nsimilar instances nre upon record. Delrio states,\nthat a gentleman in Westphalia was tortured\ntwenty times, in order to make him confess\nthat he was a wolf. He persisted in refusing,\ntill an intoxicating draught was administered,\nwhen he acknowledged that the charge was\nDi itiz by\ng\nD2\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n106 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\ntrue. Delrio quotes this as an instance of \" the\nclemency\nof thecriminaljudges!\" Another witch\nconfessed herself to be guilty of imputed crimes\nafter four hours' torture; and, in another case,\na little child, nine years of age, was subjected\nto a similar process in order that she might ac-\ncuse her mother. Is it wonderful that, predis-\nposed as these poor creatures were to believe\nin the reality of spiritual possessions, they\nshould, in such extremities, ackno,vledge the\ncrimes suggested to them by their judges ?\nIt would be unfair, ho,vever, not to state that\nthere are .instances of confession in which no\ntortures were actually applied. But then, were\nnot such tortures apprehended ?\nThe zeal of James 1. against witches accom-\npanied him on his accession to the throne of\nEngland. His first parliament passed an enact-\nment, that where witchcraft was proved, the\npunishment for the first offence should be\nimprisonment and the pillory, and for the\nsecond,death. An enormous number ofvictims\n(said to amount to five hundred annually) was\nsacrificedduring the prevalence of this infatua-\ntion. The contagion was carried by those ,vho\n~ere expatriated by their religious opinions\nmto New England, 1n which land great num-\nbers perished-a disgrace to those who had\nsacrificed home through their desire for greater\nfreedom.\nNo man was ever so notorious in accusing\nothers of this crime as Matthew Hopkins, a\nnative of the town of Manningtree, Essex. He\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f\u00b7 W.trtmCBAFT. 107\nwas entitled . \"witch-finder general,\" and was\ncertainly \"by merit raised to that bad emi-\nnence.\" Was there in any quarter an old, poor,\nill-favoured, and unprotected woman, disliked\nby any of her neighboms-Hopkins was the\nforemost in bringing her into suspicion as a\nwitch. If, on the body of this person, there\nwere, as is usual with aged persona, wens, or\ncallous parts, his sharpinstruments were always\nat hand to probe them; and if the blind-folded\nvictim, agonized by the terror which often\ndestroys sensitiveness, or confused into insensi-\nbility, could not name the precise spot which\nhad been operated upon, so much the worse for\nthe accused. It was Hopkins who tied the\nvictim, hands and feet together cross-wise, for\nthe trial by the water into whic4 she was\nthrown. If she swam, she was unque.stionably\nguilty; if she sank,\u2022 shewas sometimes saved;\nbut if lost, she left to her friends the conviction\nof her innocence. Hopkins was constantly\ncrusading about upon this errand, till at length\nhe, who had. stimulated the people's phrenzy,\nbecame in turn (aa not unfrequently happens)\nits victim. His own tests were tried upon\nhimself, and he suifered for the crime of which\nhe hadso extensively accusedothers.\nThe death of .this man had probably some\ninfluence in abatingthis epidemical infection ;\n:,et bow slowly this cruel prejudice declined\n\u2022 The doctrine of this practice wu, that aa the witch had\nahaken o1f the water of baptism, that elemeut refused to\nllceivetbitcrhpiv 1illto 1wtiGlaaa\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n108 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nmay be learned from the fact, tha~ even in the\nlast century, especially in Scotland, there were\nmany persons accused on similar charges.\nIn the parish church of Forfar there still is,\nor was until lately, an instrument called the\nwitches' bridle. Chambers thus describes it :\n\" A small circle of iron, sufficient to inclose the\nhead, is divided into four sections, which are\nconnected by hinges ; ashort chain hangs from\nbehind. In the front, but pointing inwards,\nis a prong, like to the rowel of an old-fashioned\nspur, which entered the mouth, and, by depress-\ning the tongue, acted as a kind of gag. The use\nof the thing was exactly what the name por-\ntends. By it, as with a bridle, the unfortunate\nold ,vomen, formerly burned at Forfar for the\nimaginary crime of witchcraft, were led out of\ntown to the place of execution. Its further and\nmore important purposes were to bind the\nculprit to the stake, and to prevent her cries\nduring the dreadful process of death. When\nall was over, the bridle used to be found among\nthe ashes of the victim.\"\u2022 A sil:nilar instru-\nment is exhibited in the Museum of Antiquaries\nin Edinburgh.\nOne of the most detailed trials extant on the\nsubject of sorcery may be seen in a volume\npubiished by the Camden Society, eniitled,\n\" Proceedings against Dame Alice Kyteler for\nSorcery,\" in 1824.

Lady Alice escaped to England.\nAfter having been six times :flogged, one of\nthe culprits acknowledged the crimes charged\nagainst her lady, and avowed herself an accom-\nplice. She was the first person burned in\nIreland as a witch.\nIt would be gratifying to be able to state\nthat these delusions of witchcraft were mainly\nthe offspring of the darker ages ; at least to\ndefend Protestantism against their enormities.\nBut truth forbids. The period of enlightenment\nafter ages of ignorance, has, as we have already\nobserved, usually abounded in sitnilar errors.\nBut this is only an extenuation, not an apology.\nNo papist can on this subject throw the first\nstone, seeing that \u00b7the Romanist is nearly, i\u00a3\nnot entirely, involved in the same error. But\nif it shall be expected that Protestantism sh(?uld\nhave shown, in this respect as well as others,\nits own superiority, we can only say-too true !\nYet we may plead, and plead triumphantly,\nthat the reformed religion has nobly redeemed its\nfirst errors, and that wherever there is a country\nin which n1en have outlived such deadly super-\nstitions, and in which some real approach is made\nto \"the perfect law of liberty,\" that country is\nassuredly Protestant l Let us not be under-\nstood\nasclaiming for the professors of that reli-\nDi itiz y g a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n110 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\ngion a freedom at all times from mistakes. We\nonly assert on their behalf that their mistakes\npossess in the Scriptures, which they delight to\ncirculate, a c~rrecting power.\nBefore we leave the subject of supernatural\nagency, we must make one passing remark,\nin addition to those contained in our previous\nchapter. Nothing can be more unfa,ir and\nunphilosopbieal than the manner in which the\nwhole question is often treated. Even if the\nnarrations which obtain credence were much\nbetter attested than they are-were there no\nroom for suspicion that the imagination is largely\nconcerned in them-and were we entirely satis-\nfiedthat more patient attention would have added\nnothing to the alleged facts themselves, one\nthing is to be remembered-what is une.'eplained\nis notnecessarily\nsupernatural. To assert other-\nwise would be to deny the whole history of\nscience and philosophy. .\n. It is also very important to observe, how\nfatal an influence is exerted upon the human\ncharacter, and upon none more than on the\nfemale part of it, by the undue cultivation of\nthe imagination.

As it took its rise\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fASTROLOGY 118\nfrom astronomy, whils\u00b7t astronomy was in its\nimperfect state, it might have been legitimately\nclassed with some of the contents of a former\nchapter ; but as it soon outran all scientific\nbounds, till it became a mass of delusion and\nartifice, and was afterwards lost, ~s a practice,\nin the oblivion it merited, it will not be incor-\nrectly placed among the subjects of the present\ndivision. So ancient is this art that history\ndoes not record its first applications. It was\nfrom a remote antiquity practised in the east,\nwhere it still holds an undisputed sway. 'l'he\nChaldmans, the Chinese, the Hindoos, are all\nunder the influence of its fascination. It was\nknown to the Egyptians, and is referred to in\nthe sacred writings under the general de-\nscriptions of magic and sorcery. The Rab-\nbinical Jews were much devoted to it. From\nthe time of the adoption of Egypt into the\nRoman empire it was greedily cultivated by\nthe Romans. Greece alone stands, among\nancient nations, an exception to its use. None,\nhowever, have observed it with more assiduity\nthan the Mohammedan nations.\nDi itiz y\nThe early ages of Christianity regarded\nastrology as a forbidden science. In those dark\nvolumes which, bearing the name of \"the\nfathers,\" stand on the lower shelves of the\nlearned and the curious, may be found not a\nfew passages describing the processes and de-\nnouncing the practice of this dark art. Ter-\ntullian protests against it. Basil declain1supon\nit with his usual eloquence. These men did\ng a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n114 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nnot see .that the future discoveries of astro-\nnomical science would take root in its delusions;\nthey only saw that it professed an unwarrant-\nable interference with the secrets of the Most\nHigh. Nor were their objections illegitimate.\u00b7\nMen have been prone in all ages to wrest the\nattributes of God to an evil purpose, and to use\nthen1 for their own interested and servile ends.\nBy none, in a later period, was the study 01\nastrology more assiduously cultivated than by\nAlonzo of Castile. He summoned an assembly\nof the wisest astrologers of his day, who spent\nfive years in deliberation on the processes and\nresults of their science. It was during the six-\nteenth and seventeenth centuries, however, that\nthe practice of astrology in Britain arrived at its\ngreatest eminence. Some of the astrological\nprescriptions which have. come down to us\nfrom that time savour strongly of the ridiculous.\nCharles x1.(of Bartholomew notoriety) consulted\nan astrologer. He was told that he would live\nas many days as he could turn on his heels in\nan hour. The hint was sufficient. Every\nmorning, for an hour, the monarch performed\nthe part of a spindle-the courtiers revolving\non their axes in compliment to his majesty.\nAstrology \u00b7was much truswd by Charles 1.\nand Charles n. of England; and the former,\nwhen in captivity, consulted an astrologer as to\nthe period most favourable for his intended\nescape from it. If the science of the adept were\nworth anything, the king must have greatly\nmisread the advice he received.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nASTROLOGY. 115\nIn the reign of James 1.,\nDr. Simon Forman\nwas a celebrated practitioner of this science.\nHe appears to have exhibited a eingul:r mix-\nture of knavery and folly, the latter ingredient\nbeing perhaps predominant. He relates that,\nas he was lying in bed one morning, the\nquestion occurred to him-Whether he should\never become a lord ? He had recourse to his\nhoroscope thereon, and ascertained that he\nshould attain that honour in the couse of two\nyears. But there must have been some griev-\nous mistake in his calculations ; for he tells us,\nwith marvellous simplicity, \" before the two\nyears were expired, the doctors put me in\nNewgate, and nothing came.\" This was almost\nenough to have disgusted him with his science,\nbut his credulity survived it. Again his horo-\nscope promised him that he should be a great\nlord within a year. But during that year he\n\"had no preferment at all.\" His predictions\non behalf of his neighbours were equally\nfallible. A knight, being about to leave ~g-_\nland for Turkey, inquired of the astrologer\nwhether his expedition would be successful.\nThe doctor, having consulted the stars, assured\nhim it would. But the dream seems to have\nbeen one meant to be taken\u00b7 by contraries ; for\nthe consulter \"was taken prisoner in Turkey,\nand lost all.\" Again, Forman read the stars,\nand believed that he should discover the philo-\nsopher's stone. But the same stars turned their\nbacks upon him again ; for he complains that\nall came to nothing. These things are related\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n116 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nby his pupil and successor Lilly, a practitioner\nof no small eminence in his day, who says,\nmoreover, that Forman predicted of another\npupil, Dr. Napper of Linford, that he would\nturn out a dunce, instead of which he becaine\na celebrated astrologer and physician-\" a con-\nsummation which,\" says a Quarterly Reviewer,\n\" might, perhaps, approach to an accomplish-\nment of the prophecy.\"\nNor were the above the only instances in\nwhich the astrological predictions of that day\nproved untrue. Lilly relates that David Ram-\nsay, his majesty's clockrnaker, having learned\nfrom the stars, or otherwise, that there was a\nquantity of treasure lying hid in the cloister of\nWestmins~r Abbey, entered into partnership\nwith John Scott and himself, to profit by its\nexhun1ation. They met accordingly on a ,vin-\nter's night, David Ramsay bringing a sack to\nreceive the substance. They dug to the depth\nof six feet, when they met with a coffin, and\nbecause it seemed light they did not open it,\n\" which,\" says Lilly, \"we afterwards much\nrepented.\" But in the midst of their labours\nthere arose a wind so high and fierce, that\nthey feared that the end of the abbey would fall\nupon them. John Scott, we are told, grew pale\nand nervous, but Lilly managed to dismiss the\nevil influences ; yet the money-diggers returned\nas empty as they came. On another occasion,\na noted astrologer predicted that there would be\na great wind ; but as no such phenomenon\noocurred, it was afterwards discovered that the\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fASTROLOGY. 117\nhoroscope might be referring to state revo-\nlutions, abundance of which happened about\nthat period.\nYet, in spite of all failures, astrology retained\nits hold. A poet of the century thus satirizes\nthe111, having perhaps Lilly himself promi-\nnently in view-\n\" To whom all people far andnear\nOn deep importances repair,\nWhen brass or pewter hap to stray,\nAnd linen slinks out of the way;\nWhen cattle feel indisposition,\nAnd need tb' opinion of pbyaician;\nWhen murrain reigns in bop and 1beep,\nAnd chickens languish of the pip.\"\nLilly boasts that some great men among the\nIndependents and Presbyterians patronized his\nart. It is certain, however, by his own com-\nplaints, that some of the greatest eminence did\nnot ; for he tells us that Dr. Owen, Mr. Gataker,\nand Mr. Nye, denounced his pretensions as\nfoolish and impious. He took his revenge\nby vehemently denouncing Gataker. Lilly's\nknavery was strongly supported. He relates\nthat, when in Scotland, he saw a soldier stand-\ning in front of the army encouraging the men\nto expect victory, because LilJy in his book\nhad prognosticated it.\nAmong other pretensions, Lilly professed to\ngive the true interpretation of the prophecies of\nMerlin, and many pages of his memoirs are\naddressed to the elucidation of these '' dark\nsayings.\" But his greatest fame was derived\n\u00b7 from\u00b7 a work published in 1651, entitled\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n1.U:S REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\n\" Monarchy, or No Monarchy.\" lri this book he\nhad given a hieroglyphic, which 1 like others of\nthat class, might be resolved literally or em-\nblematically, as the event might be. He says, \" I\nhad framed a hieroglyphic :representing a great\nsicknessand mortality, wherein you may see the\nrepresentation of people in their winding-sheets,\npersons digging graves and sepulchres, coffins,\"\netc., and on the other side, '' a city all on flames\nof fire.\" \" These pictures,\" he says, referring\nto them afterwards, \" represented the plague of\nLondon followed by an exorbitant fire.\" When \u00b7\nthe great conflagration, which destroyed the\ncity, had taken place, he was summoned before\nthe Commons, probably with the view of ascer-\ntaining whether, at the time of the prediction,\nhe was cognizant of any incendiary intentions.\nThe House, however, found in him only the\nvagueness or dissimulation of a practised adept ;\nand after ascertaining that Lilly had made no\npretensions to acquaintance with the time of the\nfire, dismissed the astrologer. That marginal\nroom for subsequent interpretation was de-\nmanded by Lilly, as by the Francis Moore of\nour own days, is evident from bis works.\nKepler, to whose astronomical labours sci-\nence owes much, practised astrology in his day,\nthough with considerable disgust at the occu-\npation. He confesses that his services in U1is\ndepartment were only \" worthless conjectures ;\"\nbut exclaims, in apology for hia occupation,\n\" Ye overwise philosophers, ye censure thia\ndaughter of astronomy beyond her desena.\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fFlUNCISKOOBE. 119\nKnow ye not she must support her mother by -\nher charms ?

We need\nhardly say that its pretensions were founded no\nless in folly than impiety.

To acquire\nriches does not indeed fa\\l within the province\nof every man ; but all men are bound to\nobserve with care the ethical and religious\nprinciples which are concerned in the pos-\nsibilities of obtaining it. All rightly acquired\nriches must be comprehended by the following\nregulations. They muat be equitably gained-\npossessed by n~ man's designed injury-tem-\nperately enjoyed-held as a trust for others-\nincreased without exposing the possessor to\nlarge hazards-regarded as uncertain posses-\nsions-watched against as a means of self-ela-\ntion-and consecrated wholly to God.

And when our\nLord, in his inimitable patt.ern of prayer, con-\nfined the supplications for temporal blessings\nto the clause, \" Give us this day our daily\nbread,\" he reduced the wishes of Christian men\nto a very moderate standard of computation\nindeed. In uttering the sentiment,'' He that\nmaketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent,\"\n\u00b7solomon enounced \u00b7a principle of the highest\nvalue to every community and to every\nChristian in it. The industry and economy\nnecessary to secure ~he daily bread are the\nblessings and safeguards of society ; the perils\ninvolved in the sudden acquisition of wealth\nagitate and convulse it, and are not to be con-\ntemplated without a shudder. Lord Bacon\n,vell describes riches as \" the baggage of\nvirtue\" \u2022-it had been well had he not too\nfatally exemplified the truth of his own axiom--\nand adds, \" As the baggage is to an army, so\nare riches to virtue ; they are necessary but\ncumbersome, and the care of it often loseth or\ndisturbeth the victory.\" And~in another cha-\nracteristic passage he thus speaks,\" Wisdom\nfor a man's self only is, in many branches\nthereof, a most depraved thing. It may be\ncompared to the ,visdom of rats, that will be\nsure to leave a house a little before it falls; to\nthe wisdom of the fox, that thrusts the badger\nout of the house that he dug for himself, not\n\"forhim ; to the wisdom of the crocodile, that\nDi itiz by\ng\n\u2022 :Moral\nEssays.\nOr1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f...\nDi itiz by\n122 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nsheds tears when he would devour. But this is\nparticularly to be observed, that those sort of\nmen who are lovers of themselYes without a\nrival are many times unfortunate. And whereas\nthey have all their life sacrificed to themselves,\nin the end they sacrifice to the inconstancy of\nfortune, whose wings they thought they had\nclipt by that notable self-wisdom of theirs.\"\u2022\nOf this truth innumerable instances, ancient\nand modern, might be cited. Of some of them\nthe following pages will furnish a brief history.\nThe study of alchemy, though of very early\ndate in Europe, appears, as indeed we might\nhave conjectured from the very form of the\nword, to have first attained eminence among\nthe Arabians, probably at the time when they\nbecame teachers of medicine to Europe. It\nbore a considerable analogy to astrology, and\nthe two studies were frequently associated.\nThere is a considerable resemblance between\nmany of the characters used in alchemy and\nthose of the ancient hieroglyphics ; sufficient,\nindeed, to prove their origin from the same\npeople and at nearly the same period. The\nobjects of alchemy were the discovery of the\nuniversal medicine which was to cure all\ndiseases, and the preparation of the philoso-\npher's stone, which was to turn all metals into\ngold. Hermes Trismegistus and Geber were\namong the first among modern practitioners in\nthis alleged art, from the latter of whom, and in\nallusion to the language of his science, the word\n* Bacon'\u2022 Moral Essays .\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fALCHEHY. 128\ngibberishis supposed to be derived. In this\ndepartment Albertus Magnus was also a sage.\nHe was the instructor of the celebrated Thomas\nAquinas, who, in 1244, put himself under his\ntuition. It was believed that Albertus con-\nstructea a brazen statue, (which is not impro-\nbable,) that he found means to give it speech,\n(which, considering that automata were under-\nstood in that day, is by no means impossible,)\n-\nand that he endowed this head with life, (here our\nbelief is ended,) giving it the place and assigning\nto it the duties ofadomestic servant; it performed\nmany officeswell, but, like some other servants,\nits chatter was intolerable. This disease defied\nall means of cure, till one day Aquinas, who\nwas then engaged in the solution of a difficult\nmathematical problem, and was greatly dis-\nturbed by it~lifted a heavy haminer which was\nwithin reach, and, in an access of rage, dashed\nthe head in pieces. A Greek author relates a\nsomewhat similar rage in the experience of\na magician of antiquity who had transfotmed\nthe bar of his door into a water-drawing ser-\nvant, and, because it did not perform its duty\nsufficiently fast, broke it in pieces ; when, as a\nsequel, each piece discharging a separate office,\ndrowned the poor devotee entirely. No part of\nAlbertus's head, however, survived his opera-\ntion ;. but Aquinas' petulance, and the mischief\nit had done, exposed him to the sharp rebuke of\nhis master Albertus. The temper was certainly\nunworthy of a philosopher, and sir Isaac New-\nt.onproved himself a much greater man, when\na.1 glrial 'rom\n\u2022\nDi itiz y g IND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n124 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nhis only rebuke to a dog, who had accidentally\nset fire to his mathematical papers, was, \" Ah I\nDiamond, Diamond, thou hast destroyed the\nlabours of thirty years.\" \u00b7\nThe most incredible marvels are related of\nthis Albertus. He is said to have once exhi-\nbited his power before William, count of Hol-\nland and king of the Romans, by altering the\nseasons, changing winter into summer and\nsummer into winter, to the astonishment of the\nbeholders. Had the miracle been performed in\nour day, one might have conceived of trans-\nparent blinds, painted in part with sympathetic\ninks, which when cold might become invisible,\nand when warm might put on the tints of\nfoliage. But no alter.native excepting the sup-\nposition of magic seems to have occurred to the\nspectators present. He was appointed bishop\nof Ratisbon, though he soon relinquished that\noffice because his ecclesiastical duties clashed\nwith the demands made upon his time by his\nalchemical studies. But at that period those\n1\\\u00b7ho filled the thrones or stalls of cathedrals\nand priories were often addicted to alchemical\npursuits, and many painted windows and\ngotl1icportals of our own isle still remain, to\ntestify by their emblems the frequency of this\nconjunction. Though nothing can reconcile us\nmodems to the incongruity, it must be remem\u2022\nbered that out of the pursuits of alchemy have\nunquestionably arisen some of the most in1por-\nunt discoveries of chemical science. Men, in\n1earch of the philosopher's stone, often com-\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fALCHEHY.\npounded substances which had never been com-\nbined before ; and thus the crucible and the\nalembic, though they did not furnish the direct\nresults so sanguinely anticipated, led to the arts\nwhich civilize, and to the discoveries which\nbless mankind.\n\u00b7Raymond Lulli, a Spanish ecclesiastic,boasted\nor having been so successful in alchen1ical\ntransmutations, as to have converted no less\ntha~ fifty thousand pounds of quicksilver, lead,\nand pewter, into gold.* His experiments are\nreported to have been made in the Tower of\nLondon, and it is said that a considerable\nnumber of rose nobles were coined from their\nsuccess. Roger Bacon also devoted much tin1e\nand attention to studies of this description. His\nreputation for them certainly gained for him an\nunenviable name, so that henarrowly escaped\nbeing burned to death as a magician.\nThe most incredible sto1ies are related of\nNicholas Flamel and his search after the philo-\nsopher's stone. He once bought an old book\nby accident at a sma11price, which he sup-\nposed to contain secrets of the highest alche-\nmical importance. 'rhe study of this book, its\nLatin text, and its enigmatical pictures, occu-\npied the remainder of his life. In search of its\ntrue interpretation he wandered assiduously\n\u2022 Some of these transmutations were mere tricks, and con-\nsisted in inserting a hollow cone, wholly or partially tilled with\ngold and stopped with wax, into melted lead or other met~\nwhich of course dissolved the wax, and liberated the i_men-\n1oned contents into the cmcible. In 10me caaeameremuta-\ntive metals were employed. \u00b7\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n126 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nthrough various countries, everywhere !eeking\nlight on this mysterious but most precious\nvolume. At length, by patient perseverance, he\nmastered its secrete, aided by which, and by the\nhelp of his alembics, mercury became silver,\nand even gold. He found, moreover, we are\ntold, the means. of defending himself for a\nquarter of a century from death. Such is the\ntradition. Cert;ain.it is that Flamel practised\nalchemy; it is equally certain that be employed\nlarge sums of money towards the end of his life\nin founding and endowing religious institutions.\nThe rest may be regarded as the poetical\nadornment of a credulous age. We can more\nreadily believe the report that, being wealthy, \u00b7\nhe lent out, to the needy and impoverished\nyoung nobles of France, sums of money at\n~normons interest, and that thus he greatly\nincreased his wealth.\nGeorge Ripley, canon ofBridlington, (York,)\nwas in his youth a laborious alchemist, but\nbefore his death his delusion on this subject\nentirely left him, and he desired that those who\nmet with his books would itnmediately burn\nthem, for that he was fully convinced of the\nfalsehood and inutility of such studies. It may\nbe readily imagined that such pursuits as these\nbeca1ne often associated with crime and infamy.\nOf this we have an example in the case of\nGilles de Laval, a marechal of France (nat.\n1420.) He inherited the most profuse riches,\nof which he made an extravagant use ; but\nsinister rumours arose as to the manner in\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fALCHEKY. 127\nwhich he employed them. His extravagance\nsoon exhausted his treasures. To replenish\nthem he became associated with Prelati, an\nalchemist of Padua, in the search after the\nphilosopher's stone. At length the scandal\nwhich surrounded Laval led to_ his- apprehen-\nsion for sorcery, murder, and other crimes.\nGilles confessed himself guilty, and with Prelati\nwas sentenced to be burned alive. His rank,\nhowever, caused him to be first strangled.\nPrelati underwent the full sentence, and his\nashes were thrown ~ the winds.\nIn an ancient poem, a story is told quaintly\nrebuking the folly of the votaries of alchemy.\nSome youths, so runs the legend, having applied\nto an oracular source for information as t,o how\nthey should :findthe philosopher's stone, received\nthe reply in three words-Labour, labour, la-\nbour. Assuming that this was intended to recom-\nmend diligent application to alchemical studies,\nthey pursued them till their wealth and hopes\nwere alike well nigh exhausted. The true meaning\nof the oracle at last occurred to one of them.\n\" We have been deceived, my friends,\" he said;\n\" honest labour was what was meant. Leaving\nthis vain pursuit, let us each adopt a lawful\ncalling.\" They did so, and found in diligent\napplication to business the real secret of wealth.\nThe ancient college of Manchester formerly\nhad for its warder a celebrated alchemist, who\nflourished in the reign of Elizabeth-Dr. Dee.\nHe was an astrologer as well as alchemist ; the\nqueen sent the earl of I\"eicester to consult him\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n128 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\non the most auspicious day for her coronation.\nShe subsequently visited him at Mortlake, and\ncaused him to be attended during an illness by\nher own physician. He subsequently published\nhis discourses on matters connected with his\nart, and these may yet be inspected by the\ncurious in the British Museum. He claimed,\nmoreover, to be in possession of the eli,-vir\nvit<.e;\nyet, after passing through a variety of adven-\ntures, he wa-sa suitor to the queen for pecuniary\nrelief. He even pawned his books for food.\nHe died in poverty at Mortlake, 1608. Such\nare the frequent results of fanaticism and im-\nposture.\nA variety of the alchemists is to be traced\nin a sect called the Rosicrucians. They derived\ntheir origin from Paracelsus, who, in 1527, was\nprofessor of alchemy at\u2022Basle. This man pos-\nsessed a character for irreligion and immorality.\n\"He was a glutton and a drunkard, and in\nfalsehood, vanity, and arrogance, was un-\nequalled. He pretended to possessthe philoso-\npher's stone, and asserted that he had dis-\ncovered the elixir of life.\"* The sect who\nfollowedhim derived their name, however, from\nChristian Rosencrantz, who lived in the four-\nteenth century. Their pretensions were enor-\nmous. They claimed to possess the secrets of\nhuman happiness and of the regeneration of\nsociety. They declared that the treasure.aof tl1e.\nearth were at their disposal, whilst they could\nrender them~elves invisible at pleasure.

No. 574:\nof the Spectator gives an account of the Rosi-\ncrucians. \"I was once engaged in discourse\nwith a Rosicrucian about the great secret. 'Its\npresence,' he said, ' naturally changes every \u2022\nplace into a kind of heaven.' After he had\ngone on for some time in this unintelligible\ncant, I found that he jumbled natural and\nmoral ideas together into the same discourse,\nand that his great secret was nothing else than\ncontent.\" Would men only look for the moral\ninstead of the physical advantages of life, they\nwould find the way much shorter to the real\nblessings of which they are in search. It is a\npitiful thing that creatures shoul~ seek in ex-\nternal preparations that _which only Divine\nprinciples can secure.

Such a man was William Law,\nwho, having devoted much of his time to\nquestions of finance, and having impoverished\nhimself by a career of dissipation, songht to\nrecover by public projects the fortune he nad\nlost. His schemes at length led him to Paris,\nthen in a crisis of it'8 history. That country,\nby a court magnificent beyond parallel, and a\ndespotic monarch, had been reduced to witness\nan en1pty exchequer. The regent of the day\nwas the duke of Orleans-a man most dissipated\nand worthless, utterly negligent of affairs of\nstate, and careless of everything except his\npersonal pleasures. Under his regime the\nclock of the state had almost run down alto-\ngether. In this crisis of disorder, Law found\nhimself at the regent's ear, and, by holding out\nlarge pr9mises, obtained his consent to establish\na bank upon a grand scale, out of the amazing\nsuccess of which grew up the famous Mississippi\nscheme. His project was nominally to form a\ncompany, possessing an exclusive trade with\nthe countries adjacent to the Mississippi river.\nBut the powers it sought were enormous. It\nclaimed to have control over the mint and the\npublic treasury, and to have power to multiply\nthe issue of bank-notes to any amount deemed\ndesirable. Its :first success was electric. It\nirresistibly appealed to a novelty-loving nation ;\nand Law, from a needy adventurer, rose at\nonce into a demi-god. The visitor to Paris\nmay be aware ora na1TOwstreet, called Rue de\nQuincampoix ;. it was here that Law resided at\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fBOBBLU. 181\nthe time of the projection of his scheme, and the\ninfluence of the project on his 'rioinitywas asto-\nnishing. Crowdsof persons, prince and peasant,\nsenators, physicians, ladies of rank, stock-\njobbers, tradesmen - all crowded and jostlecl\ntogether, waited,regardless of weather,\nto obtain\na preference for shares. Of these there were\nfifty thousand, whilst the applicants were three\nhundred thousand ! The regent profited by the\nopportunity. He increued the number of shares\nto a large amount, and paid ofFthe national\ndebt with the proceeds. The excitement in-\ncreased. To obtain access to the house of the\nadventurer, one lady caused her carriage to be\nupset, that thereby she might excite his pity;\n\u00b7 whilst, to diminish the c~owd, another cried\n\"fire.\" The ante-chambers of the regent were\nforsaken for those of the adventurer. The\nspectacle of the poor suddenly become rich waa\neverywhere witnessed. A smile from Law waa\na priceless favour. Trade was stimulated; .ex-\ntravagance and profusion were the order. of the\nday ; land sunk in value-every proprietor\ndesired cash ; _\nand the aid of the police was\nrequired to prevent suff'ocation. Between No-\nvember, 1719, and the April of the next year,\nthe price of stock rose till it reached 2,050\nper cent. The moral state of society during\nthis inflammatory fever was deplorable, and\nevery good man regarded it with terror. M.\nde Tocqueville says, \" There wu no folly er\nvice in which the high society did not take\nthe lead; the degradation of men's minds Wai\nDi itiz by\ng Or1gl r01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f....\nDi itiz by\n186 REKARKABLE DELUSIONS.\nequal to the corruption of their manners.\" A\nnobleman of the highest rank robbed a Jew of\n100,000 crowns, .and murdered him. When\nhis trial approached, the judges had to pass\nthrough a long procession of the noblest and\nproudest families, all intreating a mitigation of\nhis sentence; and when the criminal was con-\ndemned to be broken on the wheel, the most\nactive exertions continued, though fruitlessly,\nto obtain the commutation of the sentence. In\none week Law paid for estates upwards of three\nmillions of livres.\nBut, however brilliant the horizon, it proved\nitself all clouds and vapour. The day of\nawakening came. Rumours, vague and un-\ndefined arose-none knew how; and increased\nwith portentous rapidity. Suspicion is eYen\nmore contagious than enthusiasm, or, rather,\nthe frenzy of fear is even more powerful than\nthat of hope. Men began to think of securing\nthemselves. The prince of Conti sent such a\nquantity of paper to the bank to be cashed as\nto require wagons to remove the gold. The\ncountry was drained of its specie. An order\nwas issued which diminished the value of the\nnotes by one-half. Men, struggling for the\npayment of their notes, were killed in the crowd.\nAn indescribable panic ensued, during which\nguards were numerously posted in the streets\nto disperse the angry multitude. The horrors\nof another Bartholomew day were threatened.\nThe bank stopped payment of the precious\nmetals.

At length the ad-\nventurer :fled,and died in poverty, whilst France\nwas reduced to unspeakable distress, and the\nsad effects of this mania survived in the increase\nof the national debt by one-half. Truly was\nthe Divine prediction fulfilled, \" They that\nwill be rich filll into temptation and a snare,\nand into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which\ndro,vn men in destruction and perdition.\"\nThe next remarkable delusion was that known\nby the name of the English \" South Sea Scheme\"\n-another striking instance of the extent towhich\ncommon sense may be over-ridden by the all-en-\ngros$ing passion for wealth. Like the Mississippi\nscheme, it was an attempt to lessen the national\ndebt by concentrating many funds into one, and .\nv:as promoted by greedy adventurers in order \u00b7\nto advance their personal interests. The South\nSea Company made a proposition \" to unite the\nwhole of the debts of the state, amounting to\nthirty-one millions, at five per cent. until 1727,\nand after that period at four per cent., for which\nthey ,vere to pay three millions and a half.\"\nThe bank of England bid against them, and\noffered five millions for the same advantages.\nBut the South Sea Co1npany, resolving not to be\noutdone, increased their offer to seven and a\nhalf millions. This proposal again led to a fur-\nther o:ff\ner on the part of the bank,\" to give\u00a31,70O\nbank stock for every \u00a3100 irredeemable long an-\nnuities.\" But, unhappily, the South Sea Com-\npanyobtained the preference.

A few of these simultaneous\nprojects may be noted :-A scheme for supply-\ning London with cattle and hay, another for\nmaking pasteboards, another for trading in hair,\nanother for furnishing funerals, another for a\nflying machine, another for making oil from\npoppies, etc. Such were the devices which filled\nthe mouths of the gaping multitude. But even\nthese were not the grossest absurdities.

To a\nreligious mind, nothing is more painful and\ndetestable than the delusions w:bich have been\npromoted, the crimes which have been per-\npetrated, in the name of God. Yet, by how\nmuch religion is powerful as an instrument of\ngood, by so much it is deemed worthy of adop-\ntion by the base and degraded as an instrument\nof evil. 'fhe most lamentable result of such\nerrors is, that religion is made responsible for\ntl1e tricks and enormities perpetrated in its\nname; and men easily lean1 to decry that\nwhich they have found to be associated with\nfraud and imposture. Let it be remembered,\nhowever, that if piety has been abused and per-\nverted, so also has every other system which\naae ever conferred benefits upon the world-\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fBEATH.ENORACLES\n\u2022. 153\nYP,t,as the frauds ot speculators do not pro-\nscribe traffic; as the frauds of the empiric do\nnot proscribe medicine ; asthe frauds of trades-\nmen do not proscribe all trade; as food is\nnutritious, though liable to be adulterated ; and\nas friendship is true, though sometimes employed\nfor base purposes-so religion must not be\nidentified with that which bears its name, but\nhas no affinity with its character. Painful as the\nmisrepresentation is, a secret homage to religion\nis nevertheless involved in it. The truth is,\nthat, broadly speaking, the most inveterate\nopposers of Christianity by name are the most\ntenacious protectors of its leading principles of\njustice and integrity, and would set up much of\nChrist's kingdom though they dethrone the\nKing. Could they be only convinced that, but\nfor Christianity, these principles would never\nhave been fully known, they would beware lest\nthey sweep away, under the name of priest-\ncraft, the only truths by which the dangers of\npriestcraft can be prevented ; and would they\nbut think that much, which, in various ages, has\ncalled itself Christianity, was but a well-known\nsuperscription upon spurious metal, they would\nsave themselves much real, and some pretended\nperplexity. In the mean time, nothing more\nconcerns the Christian professor than to remem-\nber, that if Christ's name be put upon trickery,\nselfishness, bard-heartedness, and fraud ; or upon\nintemperance, lasciviousness, and ambition-he\nwho so writes it is a forger and a traitor. The\nbearer of the august name of 'Christ is deeply\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f1M REHARKABLEDELUSIONS.\nconcerned in being true to his own professed\nprinciples.\nPlato, who proposed to banish priests from\nbis republic, with singular inconsistency, ad-\nvocates the employment of methods not dis-\nsimilar to those which he would explode ; and\nwhilst vindicating marriages by lot, suggests\nthe employment of secret means to regulate\nthe decisions.\nThe oracles of the ancient heathens are\nnotorious exhibitions of innumerable frauds.\nThe most celebrated among them was that at\nDe1phi, consecrated to Apollo. The priestess\nof that god was placed upon a tripod over a\ncavity, whence a gaseous and highly intoxicat-\ning vapour was exhaled, and under this influ-\nence uttered mysterious sounds, which were\n\u00b7 immediately caught up and interpreted by her\nattendants. But as the promulgation of any\npredictions was attended by some danger to the\nreputation of the priests, care was taken to\nlimit and regulate the number of their utter-\nances, and not to give forth spontaneous oracles.\nExpensiTe sacrifices were demanded before the\nconsultation. It sometimes happened that the\nmoment was not favourable to a response, and\nthe answers when obtained were often ex-\ntremely delusive-mere equivocations. If, after\nall, the prophecy turned out a mistaken one, it\nwas often pretended that something bad been\nomitted in the prev.ious ceremonial ; and the\nambiguity of many of the answers transmitted\nto posterity wu eyidently such that they might\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f155\nreceive AD interpretation on die one aide or the\nother, as the case might afterwards require.\nTo aid, moreover, in the fabrication of these\noracles, the inhabitants of the whole vicinity\nwere in leaguewith the priests, and furnished\nthem with much necessary information. Dis-\ncoveries have been recently made in some of\nthe temples of antiquity, of the secret chambers\nand hollow statues in which the priests were\nused to secrete themselves. Dr. Johnson relates\nthe following in his description of the temple\nof Isis at Pompeii \u00b7:-\" We see the identical\nspot where the priests concealed themselvea\nwhilst delivering the oracles that were supposed\nto proceed from the mouth of the goddess.\nThere were found the bones of the victims\nsacrificed, and in the refeot,oryof the abstemi-\nO'UBpriests were discovered the Temains of ham,\nfowls, eggs, fish, and bottles of wine.\"\nThe rocking-stones of the Druids were used,\nin all probability, to imply the presence of\nsupernatural agency. Some of them still\nexist in Cornwall. One, which stood in the\nparish of Sithney, was so adj118ted,as that the\ntouch of a child could set it in motion on it,s\npivot. The celebrated Loggan-stone was of\na similar kind. It wae seventeen feet in length,\nand its weight was estimated at sixty-six tons.\nEven a breath of wind caused it to vibrate. It\nwas overturned \u00b7by the captain of a revenue\ncutter, who excitied such odium by his daring\nact as to be compelled to restore it to its original\nposition. Toland imagines that the Druid,\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f156 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\npersuaded the people that these stones could\nonly be removed by miracle. .\nTo record many of the foolish, and more than\nfoolish legends palmed on their deceived vota-\nries by the teachers of the Romish religion,\nwould exceed the compass of our volume.\nBefore the Reformation, not only were a _count-\nless number of such legends current, but they\nconstituted the principal materials from which\nthe priests professed to instruct the people in\nreligion. \" The golden legend\"-one of the\nearliest volumes printed in this country, proba-\nbly by Caxton himself....:wasa repertory of such\nextravagancies, read by the priests instead of\nsermons. A few specimens of the deleterious\nfood by which the people were then fed will be\nsufficient for our purpose.\nThe legends associated with the name of St.\nGregory are manifold. It is related of him,\nthat one day, when officiating at the altar, a\nbright cloud descended, which filled the church\nwith so heavenly an odour, that none could\ndare to enter it. On another occasion,he caused\nthe consecrated bread to appear in the form of\nvisible .flesh. Again, when certain ecclesiastical\nambassadors came to Rome searching for relics,\nhe gave them a linen cloth which had been in\ncontact with the body of a saint. The mes-\nsengers saw nothing in this present, and de-\nspised it ; on which St. Gregory pierced it with\na knife, and the cloth shed miraculous blood.\nWhen Gregory absented himself from Rome to\nescape the honours ofthe popedom,a pillar of fire\n...._\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nEIIPBESSHELENA-ST.

This cross was repre-\nsented to possess such powers, as to be capable\nof being reproduced to any extent without loss\nof its original virtue. This was convenient,\nespecially at a time when so many pieces of it\nwere spread about in Europe as to have made,\nhad they been all collected, many crosses in-\nstead of one.\nThe story of St. Denis, or St. Dionysius, is\nperpetuated in the neighbourhood of Paris by\nthe church which bears his name, and which\nwas formerly the mausoleum of the French\nkings. Dionysius is reported to have been\nbeheaded for his adherence to the Christian\nfaith, on the \"Mount of the Martyrs,\" (Mont-\nmartre.) Immediately after his decapitation,\nhis dead body rose from the ground, took its\nbead into its hand, and, amidst a crowd of\nangels, walked for two miles, till it met an old\nwoman, into whose bands the saint put his own\nhead. It was even believed that St. Denis\nkissed the head \u00b7 he carried. Is it wonderful\nthat such tales as these have brought the name\nof Christianity into suspicion and contempt\namong a community who only know it through\nthe imperfect representation of it which Popery\npresents?_\nIn some of the letters relating to the sup-\npression of monasteries, now published in one\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\n108 BBKARliBL& DELUSIONS.\nvolume by the Camden Society, are curious\nparticulars relative to the gro\\\\yth of credulity\nin a former age. The following is from a\nletter of Layton, one of the commissioners for\nthe suppression, to secretary Cromwell :-\n\" By this bringar my servant, I send you\nreliquies, fyrste, two flowers wrapede in white\nand blake sarcenet, that one Christymas evyn\nhorl1 ipsd qu\/J ChrWus natus fuerat, (in the\nvery hour in which Christ was born,) ,vill\nspring and burgin (bud) and bear blosson1s-;\nquod expertum esse,(bad Latin for, ' which is a\nfact,') saith the prior of Maden Bradeley; ye\nshall also receive a bage of reliquis, wherein ye\nshall see strangers thynges as shall appere by\nthe scripture as Gode's cote, (God's coat,) oure\nlady's smoke, parte of Gode's supper in cena\nDomini\/' (in the Lord's supper,) \"pars petri\nsuperqud natusest Jesus in Bethelem, (part of\nthe stone on which Jesus was born in Beth-\n- lehem,) belyke ther is in Bethelem plentie\nof stones and sum quarrie, and maketh their\nmangers of stone,\" etc. etc.\u2022\nNo so-called miracle of the Romish church\nhas been paraded with more eclat than the\nliquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius-a\nwonder still exhibited at Naples.

Strange as,\nin many respects, the progress of this delusion\nhas been, we must not forget that it was the\ninterpolation with his own Iying materials of\nmany of the nobler precepts of the religion of\nGod, which alone imparted to it influence.\nAbout the middle of the seventeenth century,\ngreat excitement was caused among European\n,Jews by the claims of Sabbatai Seva, who\ndeclared that he ,vas the Messiah of that\nancient people. Though renouncing, in the\nface of the wonderful accordance of fact with\nprophecy, the demands of Jesus to be regarded\nas the predicted Messiah, that ancient people\nhave ever shown a remarkable disposition to\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f164 REMARKABLEDELUSIONS.\nbelieve in false prophets. Seva was the son of\na merchant of Smyrna, and after a somewhat\nerratic course in the earlier period of his life,\ndeclared himself to be the long-expected one of\nthe Jews. He was assisted in this imposture\nby one Nathan, who personated the character\nof Elijah, Messiah's precursor. The 26th of\nJune ,vas fixed as the period of manifestation ;\nand it was announced that at tl1at time the\nMessiah would sit upon the throne of the grand\nsignor. 'rhe deception succeeded to a large\nextent, and multitudes of the Jews engaged in\nprepal-atory acts of devotion,,and expected their\ndeliverer. But the chief men alone were sus-\npicious, denouncing Sabbatai as an impostor,\nand they consequently exposed themselves to\ngreat unpopularity an1ong the mass of their\nbrethren. Sabbatai in the mean time advanced\nfrom prediction to asserted miracle. As a\npillar of fire had guided the Israelites on their\nfirst emancipation from Egypt, so, it was de-\nclared, a si1nil~r spectacle should herald them\nback to the scenes of their former glory. Such\na portent, Sabbatai said, had already greeted\nhim, though he alone had been able to discern\nit. Yet this was believed on his own uncorro-\nborated testimony. He next determined to\nvisit Constantinople, there to proclain1 his new\nmission. But his claims had given some un-\neasiness to the Sublime Porte, and instead of a\ntriumphant entry, the impostor only found in\nthat ancient city chains and prison-darkness.\nHe ,vas summoned at length before the grand\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\u2022\nI\niI\n\fENTHUSIASTS AT MUNSTER. 165\nsignor, and told, that nothing less than a mira-\ncle would save him from being punished for\nwilful deception. The test to which he was\nexposed was severe. He was ordered to be\nstripped naked, and it was declared, that if\nwhen shot at by marksmen he remained unhurt,\nhis Messiahship should be immediate!y acknow-\nledged. The impostor quailed and confessed.\nBut this was not all. He was ordered to\nbe immediately impaled, unless he renounced\nJudaism and embraced Mohammedanism. To\nthis also Sabbatai consented, declaring that to\nbecome a Turk \\\\Tas an honour he had long\ncoveted. Such was the disgraceful unveiling of\nthis \" speaker of lies in hypocrisy l\"\nSeveral other pretenders to the Messiahship\nof the Jews have since appeared-amongst\nwhich may be distinguished Hans Rosenfeld, a\nGerman, who for this offence was ,vhipped and\nimprisoned for life ; and Richard Brothers, who,\nin the latter part of the last century, found a\nhome in Bedlam.\nThe dreadful extravagances practised at\nMunster, in 1538, if not well attested, would\nseem almost incredible. Certain so-called\nreligionists, with whose impieties no sect in the\npresent day can be legitimately associated, pro-\nclain1ed that a new Jerusalem was to be set up\nin that city, which was to attract the whole\nearth to its influence.

Against such\ndoctrines, therefore, the early Reformers, and\namongst others Melancthon, lifted their loudest\nprotests. From Munster, however, the flame of\ndisaffection spread into Holland, where John of\nLeyden, already notorious for the part he had\ntaken in the first insurrection, was proclaimed\nthe apostle of this insane and dangerous mission,\nattended by twelve disciples, most of whom\n,vere women. This man claimed, by authority\nfrom heaven, to be king over the whole earth,\navowing that he was commissioned to raise an\narmy which should put down the unbelieving\npowers of this world. He was at length be-\nsieged in Munster by its bishop, count Waldeck.\nFor a long time the city held out under his\ninfluence. But John of Leyden was at last\nbetrayed ; an entrance was treacherously\neffected into the city, and the leaders of the\ninsurrection were punished by exquisite tor-\nments, their flesh being torn from their bones\nwith red-hot pincers, whilst their mangled\nremains were exhibited in iron cages.

Some ot\nthem coming in England in 1706, with great\nvigour and earnestness, endeavoured to spread\ntheir notions here, where they were but too\nwell entertained ; their common cry among us\nwas, that this new prophetic dispensation was\nto be llroclaimed in every nation under heaven,\nbeginning in EI)gland, and to be ~anifested\nover the whole earth within the short time of\nthree years.\" These people were called \"French\nProphets.\" One of their adherents was called\nLacy, and was well known to the doctor. 1'his\nman imagined himself inspired.

It is incredible to what extra-\nvagancies men may be led by the influence of\ndiseased self-esteem. Even in ordinary inter-\ncourse with society, a sagacious observer must\nl1ave known many who are utterly incapable\nof deliberately violating truth, and yet who so\ntorture the smallest occurrences into self-flat-\u00b7\ntery, as to derive incense from the most insig-\nnificant sources.

It cannot be too strongly im-\npressed upon the mind, that religion is a system\nof external evidences, as well as of internal \u2022\nexperience; that it is as much objective,as it is\nsubjective;that its revelations are not only sus-\ntained by inward consciousness, but by pro-\nphecy, miracle, contemporaneous testimony,\nand a_world-wide adaptation. As we dwell on\nthe pages which record the progress of reli-\ngious delusion, how strong is sometimes the\ndesire that we could subject its promoters-not\nto the tortures of the red-hot pincers, or the\nboots, or pilliewinkies of former times-but to\na searching cross-examination as to their visions\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f,\ntDi itiz by\nTHE BUCHANITES. 171\nthemselves-the motives of love of applause by\nwhich they might have been influenced-the\nstate of health in which they were at the\nmoment-the tests they would apply to sepa-\nrate their own convictions from the impositions\nof credulity-and the Scriptural warrant for\nbelieving their practices true.

As its pernicious errors have exten-\nsively spread, a more detailed exposure of them\nmay be useful. This sect originated with one\nJoseph Smith, who, though he was, perhaps, at\na subsequent time partially the dupe of his own\ndelusions, began his course as an impostor of the\nblackest order. Hypocrisy is seldom found\nunmixed, and the most atrocious deceivers are\nusually, in someimportant respects,self-deluded.\nJoseph Smith was born in the state ofVermont,\n(U.S.) in the year 1805, and though an illiterate\nman, who could scarcely read and write, was\npossessed of great talents, which he afterwards\nused for the most injurious purposes. The\nwhole family to which he belonged were loose\nand unsettled, incapable of industrious applica-\ntion, and seeking their livelihood by digging\nfor treasures supposed to be deposited in the\nearth by the ancient buccaneers. In these\nexploits Smith distinguished himself as a clair-\nvoyant. Putting a certain stone, to which he\nattached much value, into his hat, and then\nhiding his head iu it, he professed to be able to\npoint out the quarters in which the search of\nhis friends would be most successful. But\nas decept.ion is suggestive and accumulative,\nJoseph Smith advanced from one lie to another.\nHe pretended to receive visions from Heaven,\nand though not yet fourteen years old, he found\nthose who were ready to give credence to\nhis tale. These visions, however, did not alter\nthe course of his 1ife, which was at this time,\naccording to the admissions of his own people,\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\fDi itiz by\nTHE MORIIONITES. 178\nvain and abandoned. He pretended to have\nbeen Divinely told, that the American Indians\nwere descendants of the ancient Israel-the\ncolour of their skins having been miraculously\nchanged in punishment for their transgressions;\nthat they had emigrated to America at an early\nperiod of the world's history; that their record,\nwere Divinely preserved, and constituted a book\nof revelation from God ; and that he himself, if\nfound faithful, should be employed to exhibit\nthese records to the world. In process of time,\nanother revelation, he declared, told him where\nthis sacred book was deposited, and Joseph Smith\ncommunicated the information he had received\nto his father and brothers. The father insisted\nthat they ~hould immediate!y go to the indicated\nspot, and satisfy themselves of the existence of\nthis extraordinary volume. The family went\naccordingly, and dug up the ground with im-\nplements provided for the purpose. But when\nthe chest had just inet their view, it was super-\nnaturally removed out of their sight. Again\nthey disinterred it, but amidst thunder and\nlightning the same process was repeated, and\nthey fled in t.error to their home. Joseph alone\nremained behind them. As he was slowly\nreturning to his house, he encountered a dread-\nful vision of an angel, who in a fearful voice\nspoke to him, whilst lightning was flashing\naround, upbraiding him for the disobedience\nof which he had been guilty, in communicating\nthe dreadful secret. He was \u00b7afterwards sent\nalone to the spot, and was commanded to take the\n\u2022\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f] 74 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\ncl1est, and to bury it under his hearthstone, but\nforbidden to investigate its contents. Together\nwith the book, he professed to have found two\nstones, designated in his first narratives a pair\nof spectacles, but afterwards termed \" the Urim\nand Thummim \"-\" two transparent stones set\nin the two rims of a bow,\" which were to\nenable him to decipher these wonderful records.\nDr. Authon, of whom we shall speak hereafter,\nrelates:-'' The way that Smith made his\ntranslations and transcripts was the following:\nAlthough in the same room, a thick curtain\n'or blanket was suspended between them, and\nSmith, concealed behind the blanket, pretended\nto look through his spectacles or transparent\nstones, and would then write down or repeat\nwhat he saw, which, when repeated aloud, was\nwritten down.\" The severest judgments were\ndenounced against the scribe, if he should pre-\nsume to draw near to, or ~ven to look upon\nSmith, whilst thus dictating. One Sidney\nRigdon was largely engaged in this work of\ntranscription, and at length, under these aus-\npices, what is called \"The Book of Mormon\"\nwas brought forth to the world as a new\nrevelation. It professes to have been found\nwritten on golden plates, in a mysterious\ncharacter, which only Smith himself was able\nto read, and he simply by a supernatural\nimpulse. Its contents relate to different pe-\nriods, and contain fifteen books, the produc-\ntions of as many authors.

Smith's testimony. Simul-\ntaneous}y, another paper was put forth by\neight other witnesses, declaring that they had \u00b7\nseen the plates, which bore the appearance of\ngold, and that they had also seen the engrav-\nings upon them. Such, then, is the basis of\nthe J\\,lormon imposture. Joseph Smith, who\nappears to have had Mohammed in his eye,\nand to have imitated some of his leading trans-\nactions, professes a new revelation ; declares\nthat an angel from heaven has directed him to\na Divine book, long hidden from the world;\nsupports his declaration by bringing forward\nthree witnesses, who avow they have seen an\nangel, who corroborates Smith's statements,\nand eight others who declare that they have\nseen the golden volume. But it remains invi-\nsible to all other eyes, and is, as the Mormonites\npretend, divinely shut up from the view of all\nbesides. On this testimony the Book of Mor-\nmon claims to be received as a special revela-\ntion from God.\nNow\u00b7 the absence of the book itself, it must\nbe obvious, gives the complete lie to the whole\ntransaction. Such a pretence as that of Smith\ndemands the largest proof-the most open pub-\ng a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f176 REMARKABLEDELUSIONS.\nlicity. Christianity could say, \"These things\nwere not done in a corner.\" Mormonism, \u00b7on\nthe contrary, is the 1nost \" hole and corner\ndevice\" imaginable. Christianity is, it is true,\ndependent on testimony, ~ Mormonism pro-\nfesses to be. But the testimony which sup-\nported Christianity was a testimony borne in the\nmost open and the strongest manner. Our Lord\nhad been crucified by the Jews and buried ; his\ndisciples declared him risen again, and assert~d\nthat he had so proved his Divinity. Not three\nonly, but \"above five hundred brethren at\nonce,\" were ready to prove that they had seer\nhim. The disciples bore this testimony in\nJerusalem, before our Lord's very crucifiers, in\nthe most repeated form, and when the produc-\ntion of the body of Jesus would have silenced\nthem at once, such a proof could never be\nmade. Mormonism, on the contrary, produces\nthree witnesses, who bear witness to an appear-\nance which might have been delusive, and if\nnot an invention altogether, has not strength\nenough to influence the world in its favour.\nThey say that they have seen the engravings\nand the plates, and they declare that an angel\nbrought them from heaven. But they do not\ndeclare that they saw the angel-only that he\ncame and laid the plates before their eyes. The\nstatement is so loose that one wonders at the\namount of credit it has received. There was\nobviously nothing in Smith's previous character\nto render it unlikely that he should invent the\nwhole story.

The Mor-\nmon writers lay great stress on the unlikeliness\nof so young a man inventing such a lie. But\nthe improbability is altogether imaginary. The\nannals of deception furnish many much younger\ncriminals. \u2022\nH we examine the names of the witnesses,\nnamely, of the three affixed to the first paper,\nand of the eight subjoined to the second, we\nshall find that of the three first, one was Smith's\namanuensis, (Cowdery,) one probably either a\nrelative or intimate connexion, (Whitmer,) and\none an amanuensis and a dupe, (Harris,) and\nthat of the eight others, four ,vere Whitmer' s\nand three Smith's own family. The majority\nwere thus unprejudiced witnesses truly 11 It\nmay be observed respecting Martin Harris, who\nperhaps was the most honest of the group, that\nhe was evidently one of the weakest of men.\n\"A gentleman of Palmyra, bred to the law, a\nprofessor of religion, and of undoubted vera-\ncity,\" is reported on good authority to have\n\" appealed to Harris, and to have asked him\ndirectly, ' Did you see those plates?' Harris\nreplied he did. ' Did you see the plates and\nthe engravings on them with your bodily eyes?'\nHarris replied, ' Yes, I saw them with my\neyes ; they were s~own me by the power of God\nand not of man.' 'But did you see them with\nyour natural, your bodily eyes, just as you see\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f..\n178 REMARKABLE\nDELUSJONS.\nthis pencil-case in my hand?

Harris replied, ' Why I did not\nsee them as I do that pencil-case, yet I saw\nthem with the eye of faith; I saw them just as\ndistinctly as I see anything around me, though\nat thetime they were coveredover with a cloth.'\"\nAt the time the pretended finding of these\nbooks took place, this man applied to professor\nAuthon, a man of large reputation as a scholar,\ninforming him that \" a gold book, consisting of\na number of plates fastened together by wires\nof the same material, had been dug up in the\nnorthern part of the state of New York, and\nalong with it an enormous pair of spectacles.\n'fhese spectacles were so large that if any per-\nson attempted to look through them, his two\neyes would look through one glass only..\u2022\n'Whoever,' he said, ' examined the plates\nthrough the glasses was enabled not on1\ny to\nread them but fully to understand their mean-\ning.'\" Harris, moreover, said, thitt having been\nrequested to contribute a sum of money for the\npublication of the said book, he had come to\nask the professor tocounsel him on the contents\nof a paper he had brought with him, which\nprofessed to be an extract from this mysterious\nvolume. The professor regarded the matter\nfirst as a hoax, and then as a cheat. The\npaper consisted of \" all kinds of crooked cha-\nracters,\" composed of different ancient alphabets,\nand ending with \"the rude delineation of a\ncircle, divided into various compartments,\ndecked with various strange marks, and evi-\n8\nOr1QI\nrial 'rbm\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n......\n\fDi itiz y\nTIIE MORIIONITES. 179\nI\ndently copied after the Mexican calendar given\nby Humboldt, but copied in such a way as not\nto betray the source whence it was derived.\"\nSubsequently the professor advised Harris to go\nto a magistrate, and have the whole affair\nexamined. This he declined to do, stating his\nconviction that the curse of God ,vould rest\nupon him if he di9 so. Such is the testimony\nof professo~ Anthon. By what means Harris\nwas afterwards induced to affix his name to the\npaper which professed that he had seen the\nplates is unknown, but the process taken with\nso ,iveaka man is not i\u00b5conceivable.\nIt may appear strange that an illiterate man\nlike \u00b7 Smith should have been able to invent\na story such as that contained in the Book of\nMormon. But there are other circumstances\nwhich explain the wonder. It appears that, in\nthe year 1809, one Solomon Spaulding, who had\nbeen previously a clergyman, set himself to\ncompose a religious tale, based upon the assumed\nfact that the North American Indians were\ndescendants of the lost tribes of Israel. As he\nproceeded in his story, he read portions of his\nmanuscript to his neighbours, who beca1ne\ngreatly interested in it, especia11yin that part\nin which he fictitiously related how he had\nfound an ancient record, imitating the style of\nthe Old Testament. This volume was after-\nwards put into the hands of a bookseller for\npublication, and whilst there was copied by\nSidney Rigdon, who it is to be observed was\none of the pron1oters of the Mormon imposture.\ng a.1 glrial 'rom\nIND IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f180 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nSpaulding's brother declared that the pretended\nScriptures were altogether compiled from his\ndeceased brother's manuscript. The widow of\nSpaulding bore the same testimony ; and it is\nadded that the neigh hours to whom the original\ntale had been read, instantly recognised the\nproduction with which they had been heretofore\nfamiliar as incorporated in the Book of Mormon\nwhich came forth from Joseph Smith as a new\nrevelation from Heaven. Rigdon denied, indeed,\nthe whole transaction, but in so abusive a\nstyle and manner as by no means to add to our\nconviction of his veracity.\nThe manner in which this pretended revela-\ntion is co1npiled, is extremely clumsy and\nilliterate. Such phrases as the following are\nfrequent :-\" I saith unto them\"-\" these things\nhad not ought to be\"-\" ye saith unto him\"-\n\" ye are like unto they.\" The mariner's com-\npass is spoken of as haying piloted these ancient\nIsraelites upon their ~oyage, though well-known\nnot to have been applied as a nautical instru-\nment until many ages later than the professed\nperiod. The Messiah is called by names not\nknown at all to the ancient Hebrews, and of\nwell-known Greek origin.\nWhat are the doctrines of the books them-\nselves? If the Book of Mormon have any\nmoral power, it is derived from its appropriation\nof Scriptural truth which it admits, though its\ninterpretation grossly garbles the contents of\nthe sacred volume. It receives the doctrine of\natonement and of punishment for sin, and it\nDi itiz by\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n-'\n\fDi itiz by\nTHE IIORMONITES. 181\navows a code o( pure morality. But certain\nallegations borne to the conduct of some of its\nfollowers, even of Smith himself, have tended\nto throw considerable suspicion upon the prac-\ntice of the most eminent of its apostles. Mor-\nmonism enunciates an entirely new system of\nchurch government, dividing its priesthood\n\u2022into two branches, each consisting of many\nofficers- the Melchisedec and the Aaronic\npriesthood. In these offices,Joseph Smith, as\nmight be expected, bears the pre-eminence. It\nlays great stress on baptism for remission of\nsins. It regards the church as a living inter-\npreter of revelation. It interprets the Hebre,v\nScriptures literally, never symbolically. It\nt~1ereforebelieves that God possesses a human\nform, which doctrine is avowed in all its\ncreeds and catechisms. It sets up a great\nscheme of worldly polity, to which it believes\nthat all the inhabitants of the earth will become\nultimately subject, and which affords peculiar\nadvantages to its founders and leaders. It\ndeclares that \" no one can possibly be saved\nand reject\" its messages. Against all forrns\nand creeds it wages, therefore, the most offensive\nand deadly warfare; labouring thus to uproot\nand destroy all the seeds of piety sown in the\nhearts of men. Of all spiritual religion-the\nreligion of the heart-it is mainly ignorant,\nthe visible and external being the leading\nobjects of its ambition.

Such\nwonders often arise out of the faith of the\noperator alone.\nThe history of ~Iormonis1n is, however, very\nsingular, and affords a remarkable proof how\npersecution may lift into eminence the system\nagainst which its attacks are directed. Basing\nhis system on such pretensions as we have\ndetailed, Joseph Smith soon found himself the\nhead of a growing sect. From the 1st of\nJune, 1830, when its numbers were thirty, it\nadvanced like the religion of Mohammed, in\nregularly increasing development. As it grew,\nthe opposition against it became loud and\nvehement, and men, disgusted with its preten-\nsions, attacked it with a violence which savoured\naltogether of this ,vorld.

A mob dragged him from\nhis bed in a village called \"Hiram,\" and\nviolently tarred him and some of his followers.\nThe same mob tracked his footsteps, caused\nriots wherever a Mormon settlement was found,\nsacked the houses of the religionists, and\ncompelled them to emigrate into distant coun-\ntries. Such proceedings as these of course\nexcited sympathy and furnished undeserved\npower to the new sect ; and though the public\nauthorities reprobated the persecution, it was\neasily put by the Mormons to the discredit of\nthe old sects. The expatriated people moved\ninto the state of Missouri. Whilst there, the\nfollowing entry occurs in one of the journals of\nthe elder accompanying the prophet. It will\nbe understood as bearing reference to the\nmeteoric appearances well-kno,vn to philoso-\nphers as characterising the month of Noven1-\nber, and may be taken as an example of the\nwhole delusion:-\n\" November 13.-About four o'clock, A.Irr.,\nI was awakened by brother Davis knocking at.\nmy door, and calling on me to arise, and behold\nthe signs in the heavens. I arose, and to my\ngreat joy beheld the stars faHfrom heaven like\na shower of hail-stones-a literal fulfilment of\nthe word of God, recorded in the Holy Scrip-\ntures, as a sure sign that the coming of Christ\nis close at hand.\"\nSuch were the delusions which impressed\n8\nOr1<;JI\nr~ 'rom\nINDIANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f184 REMARKABLE DELUSIONS.\nthe minds of the Mormon leaders, and were by\nthem communicated to their people.\nIn the midst of dangers such as those to\nwhich he was exposed, Joseph Smith began to\norganize his followers into a body-guard to\ndefend him against his enemies. His brother,\nHiram Smith, was nominated captain, and\nanother brother, George Smith, held the office'\nof armour-bearer. Such measures on Smith's\npart provoked corresponding ones\u00b7 on the side\nof his enemies. An antagonist force was rapidly\nraised, and one of the leaders of this band swore\nto destroy Smith and his army. Before he\ncould accomplish this threat, however, the man\nwas drowned in the midst of the Missouri\nriver-an event which Smith did not fail to\nregard as a just punishment of his foe. Soon\nafter this event, the cholera broke out in the\nMormon army. At first, Smith endeavoured to\ncure it by the power which he supposed to be\nvested in himself, but he soon learned that the\ndisease was quite beyond his influence, and\nthirteen .of his band were\u00b7 removed by it.\nAbout the same time, Smith was accused by\nsome of his own followers of prophesying lies,\nand appropriating the money of his people. He\nmet the charge boldly, however, and the accuser\nretracted \u00b7the charge.\nJoseph Sn1ith itl accused of having fled from\nbis debts in Kirtland, where his first settlement\nhad been, in the middle of the night, leaving\nhis creditors to do as they could.

But\nthe last was deeP.in Joseph Smith's secrets, and\nwas soon forgiven. The persecution of the\nbody in the meantime continued. Obst.ruc-\ntions being offered to the right of voting in\npolitical elections by the enemies of Smith, a\nregular series of assaults took place, which\nlasted during several weeks. In the end, an\nattempt was made to massacre the Mormons.\nThe Mormons now began to establish them ...\nselves in Illinois, where they formed a .town,\nwhich they ca11ed\"Nauvoo,\" or beautiful. Of\n.this towQ Smith was .appointed mayor, and in\naddition to his titles of prophet and president,\nwas also termed lieutenant-general.\nIn 1837, Mormonism began first to make\nhead in England, and in that year made many\nconverts among the ignorant and weak-minded,\nprincipally iu the manufacturing districts. Those\n\u00b7who looked to religion for a system of external\nadvantdge and polity, saw much in this new\nsystem which corresponde_d with their views.\nIn 1841, Joseph Smith directed, under inspira-\ntion, as he termed it, the construction of a\nmagnificen~ temple at Nauvoo, to which he\ninvited contributions from all quarters. It was\nwell situated, and of large proportions, and a\nmillion of dollars were expended upon its\nconstruction.\nAmong other descriptions given at this time\ng Or1glr01 'rl:lm\nIN \u25a1 IANA UNIVERSrTY\n\f186 REMARKABLE\nDELUSIONS.\nof the prophet, is one delivered by a public\nlecturer, named Newhall, who was present at a\nreview of his army by Smith himself, attended\nby \" six ladies on horseback, who were dressed\nin black velvet, and wore waving plumes of\nwhite feathers, and rode up an\"ddown in front\nof the regiment.\" The prophet himself is called\n\"very sociable, easy, cheerful, obliging, and\nkind, and very hospitable-in a word, a jolly\nfellow, and one of the last persons whom he\nwould have supposed God would have raised up\nas a prophet or priest.\"\nIt was about this time that one of the leaders\nof the Mormonites, Sidney Rigdon, promulged\nthe abhorr.ent doctrine of plurality of wives, in\nimitation of Mohammed himself-a doctrine\nwhich Smith was regarded as greatly favouring.\nSmith, now at the very height of his ambi-\ntion, was put forward as a candidate for the\npresidentship of the United States, and pub-\nlished what he termed '~General Smith's Views\nof the Government and Policy of the United\nStates.\" . It is needless to say that his preten-\nsions were regarded iu the main with contempt.\nSoon after this, the accusation against Smith of\npromoting the \" spiritual wife\" doctrine, sus-\ntained asit was by the affidavits of sixteen\npersons, led to the destruction by the Mormons\nof the newspaper which had published then1,\nand thence to a serious conflict between the\nMormonites of Nauvoo and the surrounding\ninhabitants, in the course of which Joseph\nSmith and his brother were shot.

His reputation was, however, so low,\nthat this was found to be impossible. He was\nexpelled from the society, and Brigham Young\nwas appointed the leader-a post which he still\nholds.\nAgain the Mormon body were compelled to\nemigrate. They were driven from Nauvoo,\nand have now fixed their residence at Deseret,\nin the vicinity of California, in the great salt\nwater lake valley, which they first reached\nafter incredible troubles and privations. 'fhey\nhave formed here a large and increasing settle-\nment; t-hey have built an enormous temple;\nthey are said to have been the first who profited\nby the gold found in California, and they have\nestablished a perpetual emigration fund, to aid\nthose from all countries who are attracted by\nthe hope of an earthly paradise. The latest\naccount of them is given by Mr. Kelly, who, in\nhis \"Excursion to California,\" gives no very\nfavourable description of the morals of the new\nsettlement. If only half the narratives given of\nthe practices of the leaders be true, they will\ndemonstrate the fact that chastity and purity\nhave no true basis among them. It is indeed\ntrue that the Mormonite books profess to abjure\nsuch practices.

There is a want\namong their votaries of an earnest, simple-\nminded, child-like desire to attain to the truth,\nand mingled, as this often is, with the indul-\ngence of some known sin, it ends in the judicial\nsurrender of the victim to a strong delusion to\nbelieve a lie. Those, however, who earnestly\nand with uprightness of purpose seek to knc,w\nthe Lord, no such delusions will be permitted\nto, entangle.

A few short words will\nbe enough.\n'fhe reader who lives in the nineteenth cen-\ntury stands on vantage-ground with regard to\nmost of the errors which we have detailed. The\nself-complacency naturally attendant on our ad-\nvanced knowledge can well afford to pity those\nwho lived in a period of comparative disadvan-\ntage, and who were thus victims of their own\ninfatuation. We censure delusions not our own,\nas the man despises the delusions of the child.\nBut what if we conceive of a state of things,\nas much or more in advance of the present, as\nthe present is in advance of the past?

He risks that soul upon ventures in\nwhich the chances of repentance are inconceiv-\nably small, and the probabilities offinal ruin over-\nwhelmingly great. The spendthrift embraces\nthe want be dreads. The drunkard faints for\nhis \" liquid fire.\" The pleasure-seeker labo-\nriously invites the ennui which he yet feels to\nbe intolerable. The debauchee eagerly invites\ndisgrac~, premature exhaustion, and a nerveless\ndeath. Men ask for martyrdom in forms which\nbring all its pains without its attendant conso-\nlations. The mind grows sick at such exhi-\nbitions. Delusion and infatuation possess the\nworld.\nIn all directions men are seen to act like\nmaniacs. Insane, when in youth they lay up\nfor themselves future diseases and death ; insane,\nwhen in manhood they solicit their own inevit-\nable disappointment ; insane, when through life\nthey kindle the fires of a life to come.
