Mingle was also the editor of a periodical published in Chicago and associated with her School of Liveable Christianity, called The Light of Truth, which should not be confused with the Spiritualist periodical of the same name.\n\nOffshoots of Mingle's organization continue today; one publishes an online journal called Wayshowers.
