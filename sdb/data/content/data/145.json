He taught in China for the China Inland Mission, and lectured in physics at Chi-lu University, Shantung, between 1908 and 1915. For the remainder of World War I he served as British vice-consul at the Chinese Emigration Bureau Centre in North China. He was labour superintendent of Kailan Mining Administration from 1919 to 1930.\n\nIn 1930 Fisk returned to the UK and began carrying out ESP research with the Society for Psychical Research, which he had joined while in China. During the 1940s he worked at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, returning to research activities in 1949.  Psychical Research in China\n\nIn China, Fisk became fascinated by the ESP capabilities he observed in some Chinese people. He carried out rough experiments, with results that he said were sometimes \u2018remarkable\u2019. He was also struck by people who could correctly indicate the points of the compass, even in complete darkness. He experimented successfully with \u2018some dozens\u2019 of his Chinese students but when he used Europeans as controls they failed.1\n\nFisk was also impressed by the many tales of poltergeist activity that seemed to occur in China.2  ESP Research\n\nHe returned to England in 1930 and in 1934 was asked by GNM Tyrrell to take part in ESP tests with Gertrude Johnson. He later stated that \u2018\u2026her scores were of a significance sufficiently high to undermine my persistent lingering doubts as to the genuineness of ESP phenomena\u2019.3 He devised an electronic machine which according to Tyrrell seemed to facilitate significant results.4\n\nThe following year he published a critique of radiation theory as an explanation of telepathy and clairvoyance,5 citing information he had gained while in China.\n\nFisk believed that quantitative research was more likely to produce tangible results than working with \u2018gifted\u2019 individuals and looked for innovative ways of boosting positive scores. Collaborating with Fraser Nicol and Donald West, he introduced into his ESP experiments a new technique of scoring with \u2018clock-cards\u2019 that allowed the assessment of near-misses as well as direct hits.6 Another innovation was the use of erotic symbols as ESP targets, following Freud\u2019s suggestion that \u2018repressed emotional complexes provide good material for telepathy\u2019.7 (This approach has since often been used by parapsychologists, for instance Daryl Bem, on the premise that erotic material has a stronger impact than ordinary images.)\n\nFisk continued his ESP experiments with a vigour that was only limited by his other work as a member of the SPR council (from 1950) and the editor of the SPR Journal and Proceedings from 1957 until 1965. He was a vice-president of the SPR from 1963 until his death in 1972.\n\nDonald West, bewailing the state of parapsychology in Britain, wrote: \u2018The yield in the last few years would have been poor indeed but for the work of one individual in particular, Mr G.W. Fisk\u2019.8 &nbsp;In 1958 he received the McDougall Award for distinguished work in parapsychology (jointly with West) for their paper \u2018Psychokinetic Experiments with a Single Subject\u2019.\n\nFisk was tentative about the reality of ESP at first but became convinced of it by his experiments. He considered that the faculty for it is widely, if sparsely spread, and that  \n\nthe mood of a percipient is an important factor in success; that some sort of sympathetic rapport between agent and percipient is of value; and also, although it cannot be considered proved, it appears likely that the mood [and] personality \u2026 of the experimenter himself, apart from the agents and percipients employed, has some bearing on the success or failure of the experiments performed.9\n\nAll of these views, now commonplace in parapsychology, were at the time just beginning to become established.
