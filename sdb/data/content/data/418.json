[Jan.,l@S6.\nOne new Member and ten new Associates, whose names and\naddresses appear on the preceding page, were also elected.\nSeveral resignations of Members and A\u00a3sociates who from various\nreasons desired at the close of the year to withdraw from the Society,\nwere accepted.\nIt was announced that Mr. Edward R. Pease desired to resign his\nposition as a Member of the Council at the close of the year.\nThe usual cash account for the past month was presented, and the\nnecessary accounts passed for payment.\nA donation of .\u00a31 from Miss Curtis, an Honorary Associate, was\nreported, and directed to be acknowledged with thanks.\nA Statement of the Receipts and Expenditure for the year endingthe\n31st of December was also presented to the Council, which showed that\nwhile there had been again a large increase in the income of the\nSociety from subscriptions and the sale of publications, it had still\nbeen inadequate to meet the needful expenditure. The receipts\nfrom the1M' sources had been supplemented by S!lme small dona-\ntions, but mainly by the continued liberality of the late President,\nProfessor H. Sidgwick. The whole question of the finances, with special\nreference to certain items, was referred to the Finance Committee, 'with\nthe request that it would draw up a scheme of expenditure for the\ncoming year, and sQ,bmit it to the Council.\nThe Annual Business Meeting of the Members of the Society, at\nwhich the usual audited Financial Statement will be presented, will\nbeheld, as arranged, at the Society's Rooms, 14, Dean's Yard, S.W.\u2022 on\nFriday, the 29th inst., at 4 p.m. The Council will meet previously on\nthe same afternoon.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nA General Meeting of the Society was held at the rooms of the\nSociety of British Artists, Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, S.W., on the even-\ning of the 2nd inst. The President occupied the chair.\nMr. Edmund Gurney read a paper on \"Collective Hallucinations.\"\nHe pointed out that, though these phenomena had not been recognised\nby psychologists, there was a large amount of evidence for their\noccurrence; and they might be explained as instances of thought;..\ntransference. It was conceivable that even a. purely subjective hallu-\ncination might spread in this way by infection; though no doubt\nmost of the cases where this explanation had been put forward were\ncases merely of collective illusion, where a real object had been\nmisinterpreted in the same sense by several spectators, generally owing\nto some verbal suggestion. In most, however, of the examples which\nthe Literary Committee had collected, the original hallucination seemed\n\fJan., 1886.J JOllrnalqf Society for Psychical RelJearcli. 155\nto be probably ~kpat\"ic, and due to the contemporaneous crisis of\nsome absent person; and in such cases it was sometimes conceivable\ntha.t the absent person had influenced two (or more) percipient\ndirectly; while sometimes it seemed more natural to suppose that the im-\npression had been propagated from one of these percipients to another.\nAccording to this theory if the reality of impressions from deceased\npersons were ever solidly established, sensory hallucinations so caused\nmight be communicable from one person to another in just the samo\nway.\nThe President said that he had listened with pleasure to the able and\ninteresting paper by Mr. Gurney. Before going further he should like\nto refer for a few moments to the progress that had been made by the\nSociety during\u00b7.the year that had just closed. He had been gratified at\nfinding that it now numbered 643 members, being an increase of over 120\nsince this time last year. He thought thu.t the success of the Society had\nbeen in great measure due to the fact that, in his opinion, the relation\nbetween Science and Philosophy had in its researches been just as it\nshould be. It WIUI his conviction that their continued prosperity\ndepended on the legitimate claims of both being duly recognised, and he\nthought this was being done by Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney in the\nspecial work in which they, were engaged. The fact. of Telepathy having\nbeen established beyond doubt, it was being investiga.ted in many\ndiJferent directions. Mr. Gurney's analysis of a numbel' of cases of\ncollective ha.llucination might play an important part in this investi-\ngation.\nSome persons, the President continued, would like to go on a.\nlittle faster than the Society seemed to be moving. His own wonder\nwas that so much had been done. Ordinary science did not make rapid\nprogress. The work of the chemist. for instance, was exceedingly slow.\nlIen of science have, however, been too ready to build dead walls. It\nhas been suggested that t.his Society had been doing something of the\n&ame kind itself. But he felt quite certain that no such stigma would\nattach to it. The Society had been loyal to the truth in its youth,\nand he believed it would remain so as it grew older. He did not\nbelicve in any such thing as a dead wall in science. The intellectual\nlandscape was in that respect as boundless as the physical. But the\nwork must be carried on laboriously. There is no royal road to any\nkind of knowledge. The links of connection must be maintained in\nevery step taken. It will be found to have been a great adva.ntage tha.t\ntelepathy should be worked up in everypossible wa.y, ever bell.ring ill mind\nthat there is no such thing as 0. dead wall. In concluding his remarks,\nthe President said that he considered that the Society had made as great\nprogress as could possibly have becn expected. He now invited remarks\nfrom anyone in the meeting.\nK :1\n\f156 Journal ofSociety\/or PSJ\/cAical Research. [Jan., 1886.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers said that although he usually found himself\nin accordance with Mr. Gurney on points of this kind, he saw great\ndifficulties in the theory which had just been broa.ched,-expla.ining\ncollective hallucinations, of telepathic origin, by a communication of\nthe telepathic impact to some one primary percipient, and then the\ninfection of other persons in his neighbourhood with the hallucination\nwhich that primary percipient's mind had deTeloped. We had thus to\nassume not only that the death of onA man could generate a\nhallucinatory percept in anothel,-which the evidence sufficiently\nproved,-but also that this hallucinatory percept itself possessed a\npower of infecting other minds without verbal suggestion. This\ninfectiousness seemed to need corroboration from non-telepathic cases,\nbefore we could assume it as operative in telepathic cases. But there\nwas no evidence that the hallucinations of the insane were ever\ncommunicated either amongst themselves or to sane persons by\ninfection without verbal suggestion, although insane delusions were\noften communicated to others by verbal suggestion. Mr. Gurney's\ncases of the supposed spreading of a hallucinatory image-not of tele-\npathic origin-from one sane person to another seemed of a very\ndubious character. Most of them were cases of what was ta.ken at the\ntime to be the voice of a dead person. But he (the speaker) considered\nthat the possibility or otherwise of communications with the so-called\ndead was an entirely open question, and that until the evidence had\nbeen thoroughly sifted we were bound to preserve a bond fide neutrality,\nand not to treat such narratives as though the interpretation which the\nnarrators placed upon them were out of the question. He felt strongly\nthe da.nger of which the President had spoken,-the danger that those\nwho believed themselves to have attained to some truth new to\nscience-such as telepathy-should build a wall round this\nnew extension of territory, and refuse to look beyond it, in the\nsame way as other men often refused to look beyond the limit\nto which the accredited sciences had already attained. For his own\npart, he preferred t() seek the explanation of these collective veridical\nhallucinations in the direction of clairvoyance. In the simplest tele-\npathic experiment-the transference of a word or number from one\nmind to another-the percipient's mind was probably in reality more\nactive than the so-called agent's, for it was, of course, easy to think of\nthe word, but to most people impossible to divine it. And throughout\nthe series of spontaneous telepathic cases we might trace instances of\nthis activity 0\/ percipience-as when a man, either in dream or\nwaking life, seemed to himself to be transported into a distant seene\nand witnessing it from a particular standpoint. Now we certainly need\nnot suppose that he was in this distant scene in any material fashion,\nthat there was anything transported thither which could reflect light or\nDigitized by Google\n\fJau., 1886.J Journal Qf Society for Psychical Research. 167\n----------------\nact; on the ponderable world. But it was conceivable that a centre of\npsychical energy might be thus translated, and might form a phantaB-\nmoue-netic radiant-point-o. point in apparent space, that is to say, from\nwhence hallucinations might be generated, which should thus directly\nreach all or some of the persons present. Support seemed to be given\nto this view by reciprocal cases; cases, that is to say, where something\nwas perceived at each end of the telepathic line, where A felt himself to\nhe in B's home, and saw what B was doing, while B on his side per-\ncei\\\"ed A's phantom in the very place where A felt himself to be.\nApologising for the obscurity of this theory and for the trivial character\nof an illu.c;trative example given, Mr. Myers concluded by saying that so\nlong as we were content to think vaguely of the great primary concep-\ntions with which these discussions were bringing us into somewhat\ncloser contact, they appeared simple and sublime; while rudi-\nmentary attempts to give precision and actuality to our thought were\nlikely to seem grotesque, trivial, and obscure. Yet, in other regions of\ninquiry men had found that, after passing through a period of similarly\ntentative groping among \"beggarly elements,\" they had been able to\nreconstitute great conceptions in a simplicity and sublimity founded more\nfirmly than before on observation and fact.\nMr. R. Pearsall Smith (of Philadelphia), a Member of the Council\nof the American Society for Psychical Research, congratulated the\nAssociation on its marked success in gathering together so many men of\nhigh scientific reputation; on the careful and yet courageous investiga-\ntions, and on the marked talent shown in its papers. He specially spoke\nof the number of intellectual young men who had been recently saved by\nits thorough investigations and masterly Report from the in1luence of a\nfascinating imposture, a work which could not have been accomplished\nsave by an organised society. The affiliated Association in America is\ncomposed of the best representative men of science, whose work will in\ndue time tell upon para.llellines in the development of psychic research.\nHe believed that the Society was building\" better than it knew,\" and\nthat the in1luence of its work was spreading throughout the whole Anglo-\nSaxon world and beyond, opening up, in its final results, great \"truths\ndeep seated in our mystic frame,\" which bear vitally on human wel-\nfare and happiness. He could not see how any delusive phenomena\ncould long survive the calcium light of such accurate, systematic, con-\ntinuous observation and record, or how wha1i truths were behind real\nphenomena could escape being brought out into the light.\nMr. Douglas B. W. Sladen asked permission to mention an occur-\nrence which had happened to himself. Some years ago, when in\nAnstralia, he dreamed one night that his father's house in England was\non fire. The dream woke him up. He observed the time,about 1.30 a.m.,\nroused his wife and told her of his dream, and also, there and then,\nDigitized by Google\n\f158 Journall?f Societ,ll fo,. Psychical Rtseal\u00b7cl,. [Jan.,188&.\n-----\nmade an entry ill his diary. Six weeks afterwards he learned by letter\nfrom England that a fire bad occurred exactly as he had dreamed.\nBut there was this curious circumstance. After allowing for differ-\nence of longitude, about 91 hours, it still seemed as if his dream ,,-as\nseveral hours subsequent to the time of the actual occurrence_\nIt had struck him whether the time of his dream corresponded with\nthe hour at which his father might have been writing to him the next\nday, whell his father's thoughts were centred both on the fire and on\nhimself. But this he had not ascertained. However, the fact remained\nthat the circumstances of the fire were transmitted to him visibly at a.\ndistance of 11,000 miles...\nThe meeting then assumed a com-ersational character.\nANNOUSCEMENT OF MEETINGS.\nThe Annual Business Meeting of the Members of the Society will\nbe held at the Society's Rooms, 14, Dean's Yard, S.W., on Friday, the\n29th of January, at 4 p_m. The nex~ General Meeting of the Society\nwill be held on Saturday, the 6th of March.\nHALLUCINATION, MEMORY, AND THE UNCONSCIOUS\nSELF.\nBy HON. RODEN NOEL.\nAs my strictures on Messrs. Von Hartmann, Gurney, and Myers\nwere published in Ligltt, and as it must be a little difficult for our\nreaders to judge of them from the extracts which my friend Mr. Myers\nhas made in the course of his reply (Journal, December), it seems well,\nby permission of the editor, te say a few words here. I hardly think Mr.\nMyers has attempted to meetmy objections; he would rather seem to have\nmade, as it were, casual darts at my papers here and there, and fished out\nextracts almost at random from them, somewhat as a boy makes darts\nat Ilo dish of snapdragon. I fear, however, he has not approved of my\nplums, and I hope he has not burnt his fingers! But this method is \u2022\nperhaps a little bit hard on one's objections,-though I am glad he gives\nme credit for CI eanlestness,\" if for no other good quality. And while I\nam not disposed to begrudge him his claim to greater knowledge of\nphysiology than I call pretelld to, I am sure he will pardon me for\n\u2022 On further inquiry we learn froDl Mr. Sladen that th\"re was a discrepancy of &\nfew days between the time of the fire and hisdream experience. He writes that\" the\nday (In which his father wrote to him was the 22nd of December, 1881, and the date!\nof entry in the diary was 1 a.m_ of December 23rd, though entered not unnaturally at\nthe foot of DflCtlmber 22ncl, after all the events of that day.\" And\" as 1 a.m_ in\nVictoria on December 23rd c(lrresponds with 3.30 p.m. on December 22nd in EnJrland.\nand as the Australian mail cloees in branch offices at I; p.m., nothing is more1ikelr\nthan that his father should ha\\-e been writing tohim just an hour orao before the mail\nc:10lled.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\f.Tat 1_] Journal of Sockty for Psychical Reutlrc\". 159\nretorting that I in my turn could wish my esteemed opponentjusta trifle\nmore fully equipped in metaphysics and psychology for his arduous\nundertaking.\nBecause I myself believe that philosophy (in this sense) can\nalone furnish the clue we need to guide us through this labyrinth of\nO<leult and unfamiliar facts, which the admimbly patient a.nd difficult\nin,-esti.,aations of Mr. Myers himself and his working colleagues of our\nSociety (in collaboration with French and other \"researchers \") are\ngradually revealing, or, at any rate, reliving. And yet I own that I\ndeem it a somewhat serious charge which he has brought against me-\nthis of ignorance of the most elementary laws of physiology-and that\npartly because no man can afford to be ignorant of the results of the\nbest thought of his time, even with respect to matters only remotely\nrelated to the topic under discussion-partly also because I have in\nLigl.t actually entered, though only a little way, upon that physiological\nline of argument, on which the peculiar theories of the writers under\nconsideration necessarily invited me to enter. And though I cannot, and\ndo not, as Mr. Myers rightly surmises, pretend to be a physiological expert\nof the same calibre as my friends the English authors of these very\ningenious and intricate psycho-physiological hypotheses, which are,\nfrom their (somewhat startling) originality, even compelling their\nauthors to favour us with quite a new language of their own, yet I do\nclaim a little of that el.erMntanJ knowledge which nearly every educated\nman now possesses; indeed, I have formerly been much interested in\n. this particular science of physiology, and have read several standard\ntreatises upon it. Moreover, though I have, as I say, partly through\ninability, and partly through failure to understand that physiology has\nmore than a remote connection with the topics under discussion,\nentered only a little way into this question, yet I fail to see that\nHr. Myers in his answer (if, indeed, he intended his remarks for\nanswer) has convicted me of such entire ignorance of the rudiments of\nthe science as he apparently imputes to me in the course of his\nremarks.\nAs instances of \"misapprehensions of a somewhat rudimentary kind\"\n(misapprehensions, as it appears from the context, of phytJioWgical di~\ncoveries), I am surprised to find that Mr. Myers cites my suggestion that\nin madness the patient may be really conversing with some alien intelli-\ngences out of the flesh, as he supposes himself to be doing, and that\nin dreams we may sometimes be really conversing with those persons\nwe imagine ourselves to meet. But if Mr. Myers had done me the honour\nto read me attentively he would have seen that I acknowledge the\ndifficulty of supposing that we do so when they are, 'So far as they can\nremember, not thinking or dreaming of us, or do not conceive them-\nseh\u00b7es to be in the situations belonging to our dream (thus Mr. Myers'\nDigitized by Google\n\f'160 Journal qf 8ociet,'Ifor PsyckiClll Research. [J...., 1886.\nfun about Bradlaugh and the woolsack does not touch me) 1 But as\nMr. Myers is himself, unless 1 err, partly responsible for the statement,\nfounded on testimony received by our own Society, that a dreamer is\npeculiarly open to \"telepathic\" impressions from other spirits far away\nfrom him in the flesh, 1 scarcely see the force of his caveat that my sugges-\ntion about dreams and madmen shows the danger of not knowing more\nabout physiology, and is a reversion to tha \"crude explanations of a\npre-scientific age.\" For if many dreams are admitted by Mr. Myers and\nhis friends to be due to the telepathic influence of spirits (1 thank\nour researchers for that valuable discovery of the fact\" telepathy,\"\nand for the convenient word), and if their great knowledge of physi-\nology has nothing to say against that admission, 1 fail to see why it\nshould have so much more to say against a suggestion that all dreams\nmay possibly be due to a similar cause. The fundamental mystery,\nwhich is yet a fact, is the transmi~on of impressions, or ideas,\nfrom mind to mind. The study of occasions or attendlUlt circum-\nstances, though interesting, helps us not at all to explain\nthe fact, nor perception. My argument as regards dreams and\nhallucinations (more fully given in Light) is briefly, that they are\nfor the most part as vivid and apparently sensible as our normal\nwaking perceptions, that they are felt and believed by us at the time to\n,be as objectiveand external to ourselves as the bodies and objects we per-\nce'ive when wide awake; the only difference being that our perception\nin the former case is unshared by persons in the normal waking condi\u00b7\ntion. Upon that 1 remark that if they were in our condition, or sphere,\nwe should probably perceive the same, or similar, objects, but as weare\nnot in their sphere or condition, we also fail to perceive and confinu the\nreality of their objects. Does Mr. Myers think, then, that his, or any\none's knowledge of physiology ezplai'118 normal perception 1 1 can only say\nthat Professor Huxley, for one, does not agree with him, and that perhaps\nno physiologist,who is also a metaphysician,agrees with him. Mr. Gurney,\nI think, does not. But if physiology cannot explain normal percep-\ntion, 1 do not understand why it should be more successful with halluci-\nnations or dreams. Here you have awave of a certain length in a supposed\n-ether (the whole being confessed to be only a good working hypothesis),\n.impinging on certain nerves, whose vibrations, or changes of some sort,\nnobody knows exactly what, are communicated to certain nervous\ncentres-does Mr. Myers think that throws any real light on the very\n.simplest sensation of green or blue, let alone the perception of an\nordered landscape 1 If he does, 1 do not know of any philosophical\nphysiologist who agrees with him. Nor again does the other fact\n(which 1 am as far from denying 8.8 I am of denying that this correJ.a..\nlation in normal perception is a fact) that when I see a landscape or\nperson in my sleep, and talk with that person-these being experiences\nDigitized by Google\n\fJaD., l.88G.] JOllrnal of Societyfor P'!lchical Research. ]61\nfully as vivid, and seemingly real, as the former, or when a madman\nis hallucinated with the same vivid impression of reality, there is\nprobably a nervous change passing downward from the. ideational\ncentres to special sense-centres-nor again, I say, does this other\nprobable fact throw any more light upon the dream, or ballucination-\nexperience than the former correlated physiological fact threw upon\nnormal sensation or perception. And let Mr. Myers be able to pass\never so stiff an examination in physiology, biology, anatomy, entomology,\nbotany, or astronomy (all sciences of extreme interest to myself, as\nwell as to him), I do not think: he will ever find that either of them\nthrow any real light upon psychology and metaphysics-[except, indeed,\nindirectly, for all is in correlation, nothing isolated.]. But what makes\nus admit the existence of a world external to ourselves1 Why, only\ncommon-sense, instinct, that very \"intuition\" about which Mr. Myers\nexpresses himself so contemptuously. Now I argue that the same\ncommon-sense, intuition, orinstinct, assures the dreamer,or the madman,\nthat he also is in presence of a world external to himself. And I do\nnot quite see how a rudimentary, or even a perfected, acquaintance with\nlIr. Myers' pet science is going to dispose of his intuition, unless it is\nalso going to dispose of the waking man's perception~lly since,' as\nI have argued in Ligkl.,the sense-centres are admitted by physiologists to\nbeaft\"ected in these other casesalso, though it be from the cortical centres\noutward. Ifit is replied that others do not share the same experience,\nand so confirm it, my rejoinder is that the dreamer does not share our\n(waking) experienceany more than we share his. Each is surrounded by\nhisown external world according to his condition, and others in the same\ncondition are likely to share the same, or at least a similar experience.\nI know enough to know that physiologists do not profess to be able\nalways to discover a chemical, or other peculiarity of brain-structure in\ncases of madness; but if they were able, I should still maintain that,\nsince their science cannot explain fUW71I41 perception, neither can it\nany better explain abnormal. But I am, to use Mr. Myers' expression,\n\"in earnest\" with my idealism; and I am not at all sure that Mr.\nMyers, though he explains that he also is an idealist, is as much in\nesmest with that as he is with his physiology. For he says that\n\"neither Mr. Noel nor I am likely to prove this interesting thesis.\"\nBut I do not hold my idealism on these easy terms. I consider it\nquite as certain and\" provable\" as physiology.\nEven an elementary course of physiology should have shown Mr.\nMyers that our sensations are subjective, that colour is not in a dead\nIDaterial objf'Ct, because it is a feeling; and then a little elementary\nphilO$ophy will show him that when felt as a colour-as blue or green-\nit needs to be discriminated, identified, distinguished, I;lOmpa.red by our\nimplicitly self-identifying Ego. And that is still more true of 80\nDigitized by Google\n\f162 Journal of Societ,ll for P8!lcllical Re8eflrch. [JIlII.,lSSG.\nperception.

This is no\nspeculative theory-(Mr. Myers, curiously enough, seems to object to\nspeculath-e theories, though his own are so ingenious)-but it is the\nmost rudimentary mental philosophy. Surely, since Berkeley, Hume,\nand Kant, it is impossible to ignore, or affect to treat it as doubtful, if\none has at all understood the problem, and the solution offered by\nphilosophy 1 Now, as I believe that we, by our mental constitution, give\n\" laws\" to nature, and Call only comprehend her according to the\nlaws of our own knowing faculty, why Mr. Myers attributes to me\nthe odd notion that \"phenomena\" are \" rea.l,\" hut not\" laws,\" I cannot\neven remotely guess! \" Phenomena\" are only possible and conceivable\nby and tl~rough \"laws,\" or uniformity of op'eration. But what I\nmaintain is that the ideal u the rea~ and the real uthe idt'.al. From\nwhat I have said it must be obvious that there can be no real outofthe\nideal; out of minds, therefore, for only in and by minds can the ideal\nprocess of experience, which alone makes phenomena possible, take place\nat all. Percepts, or objects can only be in and through some consciously\narranged, and implicitly self-identified order, or system of experience,\nwhich involves one Ego at les.st. If common-sense, or intuition insists\nthat it is also outside this Ego, say myself, then assuredly I have here\nshown thn.t it must be in another, or many other similar conscious Egos.\nHow \" physiology\" is going to affect this conclusion I cannot at a.ll\nimagine.\nThen again as to memory. Mr. Myers also classes my theory of\nmemory as another\" misapprehension of 0. somewhat rudimentary kind,\"\nand the context sbows he means 0. phyBiological misapprehension! From\nthis I suppose Mr. Myers really thinks that what pbysiologico.l\npsychology tells us about nervous changes, or motions in the ready\u00b7\nmade channels of least resistance explains memory. I am quite aware\nof what this school has said, but it never struck me as explaining\nmemory at all, whether my own theory be right or wrong. Thatseems\nto me to explain it, not of course fully, but a little better than other\nthoories. Does not Mr. Myers see that you might have the sa.me, or\nsimilar neural changes for ever, and even if you got their psychico.l\ncorrelates (but Mr. Myers does not know l\/,Ow you get these, or why\nthere should be such 0. correlation, for, as I said in Lig\/~t, the dance of\nmolecules in the nervous systems of Goethe and Homer does not explain\nthe\" Iliad\" or \"Faust,\" any more than Mr. Myers' own algebraical\nformula for revelations-XX'+HH'~xpla.ins the Bible), even, I\nsay, if you got their psychical correlates, you would not be a bit nearer\nDigitized by Google\n\fJan., 1886.J Journal flf 8odet!lfor P8ycMcni Be8earc!.. 163\nto memory? For memory does not consist in tl'6 identity of nervous\nchanges, or even of their corresponding concepts, but in our recognition\n01 tl,em as the same.

You try and remember whll.t is not in con-\nsciousness, and yet directly that flashes into it you recognise it for\nwhat you were seeking, and for the same image or notion as has been\nin your mind before. That involves a self-identifying Ego, the\nsame through all changes of experience, and implicitly knowing itself\nto be the same, comparing the present with the past experience, and\npronouncing it either identical or different. But if you want to know\nwhat memory is, you must carefully examine and reflect on your con-\nscious experience; you may, of course, also dissect, or vivisect somebody's\nbrain if you like; only the brain seems to be one thing, and my\nremembrance of a past fact quite another. Now, I argue that if\nthere was an external object, person, or thing affecting your first per-\nception, and if your memory assures you that you are now conscious of\nthe same thing or person, that thing or person 'must be now again\naffecting you. But you are o.lso aware tha.t it is the past of that person\nor thing which you now remember; the past is restored, therefore, and'\nbecome present, but this (which seems to me like a miracle) is only\npossible, I suppose, if the past has not perished; yet in time it has\nperished; hence it must' be out of its trtm8C6ndent being, above and\nbeyond time, that it now affects you. That argument may be unsound,\nbat I do not see how it argues insufficient knowledge of pllYriology to\nmaintain it, nor do I think the instance of the squib a reductio ad\noblltrclulll of it, since I regard all phenomena as in theil' essential being\ntranscendent, squibs included! But then I am \"in earnest.\"\nWith regard to the\" more complicated confusion\" attributed to me\non p. 124, I am at a lOBS to conceive on what kind of misunderstanding the-\nclmrge may be founded. On p. 516 of Ligl.e what I am referring to is\nnot sensations, but thoughts, and these are nsually located, even by\nadvanced physiologists, I have understood, in the cortical centres, and\nnot in the muscles.

[.JaD., l.888.\nWhat 1 expressly urged against him in Ligl'\" (though llr.\nMyers is curiously wrong in his allegation that the greater part of my\neflSay was directed against him! whereas it was chiefly a reply to Von\nHa.rtma.nn, and in part to Mr. Gurney) was that the instances of this\nhabit-organised, or secondary reflex action, and those of our behaviour\nwhen absent-minded, or attending to something else, which he brings to\nsupport his theory of an unconscious secondary self, as explaining a\ngreat proportion of the phenomena. of Spiritism, attribut.ed by Spiritists\nto intelligences out of the body, other tha.n those of the medium and\ndrcle, or the psychogra.phic writer, are really not to the point.\nBecause (1) here there is nothing organised for reflex action by\ninheritance, or by habit and long practice; (2) in psychography, or in\nwa.tching slate writing through Eglinton, or at a Spiritist seance, the\npersons concerned are not Commonlyattending strenuously to something\nelse, or absolutely given over to a day dream. They are, on the con-\ntrary, either watching keenly (perhaps suspiciously) the present p~\nceedings, or at all events in a frame of more or less blank, and expectant\nattention to the matter in hand.\nAnd yet under these circumstances occur the extraordinary phen~\nmena of slate writing, or those other extraordinary phenomena happen-\ning at Spiritist seances-(1 mean, of course, granting them genuine). The\nspecial instance 1 brought forward as inconsistent with Mr. Myers'\nhypothesis was that of Mr. and Mrs. Newnham, detailed in our \"P~\nceedings,\" and commented on as a proof of his theory by Mr. Myers\n(1 also brought forward the Clelia ana.gra.ms) j and 1 may observe here\nthat Mr. Myers is mistaken in supposing that my comments upon the\nvery interesting experiments in mesmerism detailed by him in the\nFortnigl\"'Zy were intended for an interpretation of his opinions\n(1 know how totally our opinions differ); they were my own interpreta-\ntion of his facts. But though Mr. Myers tells us he believes in a tran-\nscendent self, I do not quite know what use he makes of it, if not to\nafford a refuge, so to speak,for the incuba.tingideas which are to enter,\nbut have not yet entered the conscious current of a particular personal\nexperience: that is one great use of it for me, though I assert that these\ncannot enter in two full, parallel, uncommunicating, simultaneous con-\nscious currents. The transcend. nt Ego ha.s itself blocked the way for\non\" by providing another at 0. given moment. If we ever attend\nstrenuously to more than one thing at a time, we are awa.re of it then,\nand remember it afterwards. I criticised particularly the \"sub-con-\nscious\" department of this perhaps somewhat many-chambered, and\nelastic theory, in reference to the Newnham case. For the writers\nseem now to maintain absolute, a.'ld now only relative unconsciousness\nin their secondary self, as if they didn't quite know on which leg to\nstand. 1 rather wish they would finally decide on one alternative or\nDigitized by Google\n\f:Tau., 1886.] Journal of Societ.v lor P81lchical Ruearch. 16:)\nthe other. Thus too Hartmann seems to oscillate between a.bsolute\nunconsciousness, and an even \/ulkr \"masked somnambulic,\" or\nclairvoyant consciousness in this secondary self (in the latter sellS&\nMr. Massey interprets him, at least). But I shall here confine\nmyself chiefly to Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney (in this last\nDecember paper Mr. Myers appears to prefer Mr. Gurney's\n\u2022\u2022 Bub-conscious\" view). Now that, I think, is quite inapplicable to\nthis case. Because, as I have said, it is impossible that Mrs. Newnham\nherself can have been only sub-conscious of the written questions of her\nhusband, and of the relevant answers that were written to them through\nplanchette, while yet her mind was not strenuously occupied with 801M\nother subject, or abandoned to aimless reverie, but, so far as appears from\nthe printed account, was blankly and expectantly attentive. If such\na. process had taken place in her mind at all, reading and comprehend-\ning questions put by another, and intelligently replying to them, though\nin a. peculiar fashion quite uncharacteristic of herself (her attention not\nbeing occupied otherwise), she could not have been sub-conscious, only\nsemi-conscious of it; the work would not have been done, more-\nover, unless she was fully conscious; and if she was fully con-\nscious of it, and yet not cons::ious of it at the Ba77J6 ti77J6, that is the self-\ncontradictory hypothesis which I am sure no knowledge of \"physiology,,.\nhowever advanced, could ever make me, for one, content to swallow.\nI tried to show, moreover, that ab80lutely unconscious intelligence\nis an absurd a.nd self-contradictory idea--a.lso that a transcendent\nconsciousness did not seem applica.ble to such Ilo case-but now I will\nconfine myself to a. little further brief comment on this sub-conscious\nself tbeory, which, I ga.ther from his present paper, Mr. Myers now\nwishes to put forward as his own finally a.uthorised version of his hypo-\nthesis of an unconscious secondary self. But unless we are going to use\nthe words, \"conscious\" and \" unconscious\" self, in some peculiar sense\nof our own, I really do not think there is much need to define them.\nsince they connote ideas\u00b7 so funda.mental, universal, and primary. I\ncomplained in Light, however, that the writers criticised did not seem\nto have realised clearly what a self (as universally and by common-\nseD86 understood) actually does imply, for else they could hardly have\ninvented these hypotheses. Definitions of the most primary and\nuniversally understood fact of experience consciO'lume88 are perhaps a.\nlittle dangerous, as they may possibly tend to limit the meaning too\nmuch. Unconscious, of course, unle.ss specially defined, is just the\nnegation, excluding opposite of conscious. But Mr. Myers says, \"by\nan experiment in definition\" lte will mean by \"conscious\" \" memorable,\"\nthat may be remembered. Yet, though sensation is certainly conscious,\nit is not always rememberable-at least at once-though, ultimately, I\nbelieve it is.

However, if Mr. lIyers\nmeans by \" unconscious\" faint, and practically unrememberable sensa-\ntions, then I say that these would clearly be incompetent to perform the\nwork attributed to the intelligence who wrote automatically through\nMrs. Newnham j for that comprehended and appraised the questions of\nher husband, carefully and deliberately adapting answers to them\nthrough the muscles of Mrs. Newnham. That was the work of a\ncomplex, '\u00b7tJnllmwering, matured self-conscious thought, not of vague,\nunrememberable sensations.\nYet Mrs. Newnham had her train of thought and observation too,\ngoing on at UIAJ ,ame time, and she assures us that of this other train of\nthought she knew nothing, till she saw it written down. That, llr.\nMyers thinks, belonged, however, as he now says, to a \"second focus\nof consciousness in the one mind\" of Mrs. Newnham. And he adds\nthat his position is this: ., One such focus of potential (not necessarily\nof actual) consciousness may acquire knowledge, or perform operations\nnot acquired or performed by another focus, and communicate such\nknowledge, &c., to the other in various ways.\" Now, I must repeat\nthat this is distinctly a description of two selv8I!I, not of one. You may\ncall two selves two foci, and say they belong to one mind, but that\ndoes not make thefact otherwise. Mr. Myers says that I use words as\n\" metaphysical counters.\" On the.contrary, I claim that in my use of the\nwords \"self\" and U conscious\" I simply follow the meaning assigned\nto them by universal consent, and common usage. That is true when I\nsay the conscious can never identify itself with the unconscious j they\nbeing states absolutely exclusive of one another-by that I mean, in\ntheir commonly understood sense. But wilen you come to give a\npeculiar'meaning of your own to the term U unconscious,\" and make\nitmean \"faintlyconscious,\" then I would no longerassertthis-farfromit\n-though Mr. Myers indeed asserts it when he says that the ,-ery faintly\n~onscioU8 cannot be remembered. That I shall totally deny, if he metUls\nnever. I contend that feeling, if it be feeling at all, must Ilave some\nc:haracter (however vaguely) attributed to it at the moment, and that\nthis implies lOme attention-wilen the neural process has been long\nenough to accompany (not, observe, to cause) any rise abo'\u00b7e the thres-\nhold of consciousness, expressing myself in the terms of that. par-\nticular psychological school j and if there has been any attention, t\u00b7he\nfeeling may always be remembered on the fit occasion. But 1\\lr. Myers\nmust be talking of vague percepts, or notions j el~ his l'f'.marks would\nbe totally irrelevant to the discussion. Now these imply indisputably\nsome attention, or they could never have been formed and dis-\ntinguished at 11011, and so they certainly are \"memorable.\" However, my\npresent point is that thl'se faint experiences gather round no \" focus of\nDigitized by Google\n\fJan.,l8S6.] Journalqf Sode\/lIfo,.

I know that they do so, whether \"memor-\nable\" at a given moment or not--for 'else they could never have been\neouscious at all, never have risen above the threshold of consciousness,\nthat is, of ours. What other \"second focus of mentation\" does Mr. )Iyers\nthink they gather around 1 If we must put-and we must ill these dis-\ncussions-the intuition of common-sense into philosophical language,\nthen certainly what everybody who has not a theory to defend means by\na\" self\" is a given order of experience that is capable of SUbjective\nor inward identification as belonging to one and the same focus of con-\nsciousness, however various the successive details of which it is composed.\nThat one focus is you, or I.

And, therefore, I conclude that this intelligence\nwas not then, never was before, and never will be afterwards, her intel-\nligence, but was, is, and a.lways will be someone else's, i.e., that of some\nthird intelligence, using her brain and body to communicate with her\nand her husband-which is the conclusion of Spiritism. Mr. Myers\nwill have to prove not only that faint unmemorable feelings may gather\nround a second focus of mentation, and yet belong to the same person,\nthough he knows nothing of it, but also that a full-blown, mature, se1\u00a3-\nidentifying, self-remembering system of consciousness may do 80; and\nyet that is precisely what he now disclaims being supposed to mean [\nHe talks, indeed, of \" a second potentially (not necessarily &lJtually)\nconscious focus of mentation.\" What does he mean 1 A\" potentially\"\nconscious intelligence could certainly not have done the work attributed\nto it.

This is what I mean by\n\"both confounding the persons, and dividing the substa.nce.\" For this\nintelligence must have had all our categories, or fixed formal modes of\nthought behind it, by help of its own past remembered experience,\nunderstanding, remembering, putting together, Mr. Newnham's ques-\ntions, besides seeing them written, and then, by help of the same re-\nmembered and compared experience, putting relevant answers together.\nand writing them down.

That is, briefly, the hypothesis of a tmrlllUntknt Ego,\nincluding the normal ancl contemporary experience of Mrs. Newnham,\nbut this latter not including it.

The momentous fact of the correlation of nervous with\npsychical process, and the nourishment of the former by the great\nworld without, can to my idealism only mean the correlation of our\npsychical life with. and its nourishment by, the world of intelligences\nexternal to our own.

I can testify that the statement now initialled by\nhim coincides exactly with what he related to me and to othel'B in my house\nwithin an hour after the occurrence. From a very intimate knowledge of\nM. C., and of all the circumstances of the case, 1 am convinced that he\nreported only what he believed he saw, and that he is not by any llleans a\nperson of predominant and constructive imagination. Twice, I think,\nwithin three days after the 21st he passed at nightfall over the Bcene of the\napparition, and then with 311 impression and almost hope that his vision\nwould be renewed; but nothing occurred.\nThe Grove, Pluckley, Kent.\nJuly 19Ut, 1883.\nThe school at which M. C. and the boy had met was not Clijwn, but\nCheltffiham College, and I have no reason whatever for supposing that the\nboy had any connection with the locality of the apparition. The extremo\nllightness of the previous acquaintance is a curious fact in the case. M. C.\nprobably knew 200 or 300 boy. at least at Cheltenham as well or better than\nhe knew the deceased. 'Vhen at a \".reance\" the Dan1e was given, he merely\nremembered the fact that a boy of that surnamo had died-the Christian\nname he had never knoWll-Mld that his death had taken place at home-\nwhere he did not know-from illneBB begun at school. A death at school\nsometimes makes a strong impression on boy.' minds, and might serve as a.\nspiritual connecting link, but a death at home is much less impressive, 3Ild\nwould have made very little impreBBion on M. C., to judge from my pretty\nintintate knowledge of him. I feel sure that I have now given correctly tho\neffect of his statement made at the time. He certainly said nothing then\nabout any vanishing of the apparition from under his eyes. The impreBBion\nleft on my mind was that he looked away from the figure, and hurried on\nwithout again turning his eyes towards it. Three of the pupils now with me\nwere tlten at Hanbrook, and heard the whole story from M. C. just after I\ndid, and their impression agrees with mine exactly. So does that of my\ndaughter, who heard the story with me from M. C. as he told it for the\nfirst time, immediately after the occurrence. I tltink this combination of\nevidence more satisfactory than any statement of the boy's Owll could be\nafter an interval of six months and more. I believe you will be safe in\ntaking it that the apparition did not vanish under his eyes.\nWll. S. GRIGNON.\nG.-472.\nFrom Ml'B.

The fact is ahe only awoke for an instant, and as ahe is 9 yeMII younger\nthan myself, and I saw ahe bel~~ed I had only been dreaming this, I apared\nher. I had not fallen aaleel'. I did not argue the point with her, or refer to\nit again for some long time aiter. It was the aame with my father. I called\nout Mrs. W.'II name, and he referred to it all Adream in the morning.

Oxford, who\ncontributed a paper on the subject to the JounlUl for last September. The\nexperiments cannot, unfortunately, be continued RS tho ladies who carried\nthem out find that they produce sleeplOBllne8B .and headache.\nThe agent and percipient are listers, and Mr. Beatty infonlls us that\nthere is a remarkably strong sympathy between them, and that they oc-\ncaaionally dream the sarno dreams. &c. They do not wish their names to\nbe published, though they are willing to give them to persons genuinely\ninterested in the experiments, but Mr. Beatty has known them for many\nyears, and has every confidence in them. Moreover, the experiments were\ncarried out in his presence &lid under his superintendence.\nWe give the method of experimenting, and the results, as well lUI 111'.\nBeatty's comments on them, in his OWll words :-\n\"The percipiflnt was blindfolded while the card was written doWll. ~o\npack was used; the agent merely thought of a card,\" and then wrote it\ndown in a book. The percipient sat near the middle of a small, round\ndrawing-table, the agent near, but looking in a different direction. Tho\npercipient took her hand, and after about a minute told the card chosen. I\nthen compared her answer with what was written in the book.\nPERcIPIENT, M. L\nCARD CHOSEN.\n1. Ace of Hearts.\n2.

It is noteworthy that only once\nwas the percipient wrong in the suit and always right in the colour.\nIn experiment No. 10 the percipient said first, \"Three of Hearts.\" I\nasked whether that was right. Before the agent had replilld she said, .. It'l\neither the three or the eight.\" \" Which is it 1\" I asked. .. I think the\neight.\"\n\u2022 We think this is to be regretted, since the agent might have a tendency to\nchOO86 the card within certain limite or in certain 8uoceaeions, which might be uncon-\nRCiously perceived by the percipient, and this would to IIOme extent affect the chances\nof bet' guet!llinS- right.
