There was a  hiatus between volume 5, no. 4, August 1932, and the final issue, published in 1941 and called Part II, which reprinted two of Clymer's pamphlet attacks on H. Spencer Lewis and the A.M.OR.C. No advertisements except for pages devoted to \"Balancets\" (\"concentrated elements of all known non-poisonous curative fruits, vegetables and herb-vegetables\" in capsule form), sold by Food Balance Corp. of Chicago, an enterprise in which Clymer must have had an interest.  This journal reflects Clymer's mature, hierarchically organized system of churches, orders, and schools, and contains both his attempts to create a consistent history of the groups that cumulated in his Rosicrucians, and his attacks on competitors such as A.M.O.R.C.  Basically, Clymer combed the works of P.B. Randolph and F.B. Dowd, took every name mentioned (E.A. Hitchcock, Abraham Lincoln, the Count d'Ourche, Hargrave Jennings, et al.), assigned them to one or another of the Secret Councils that supposedly oversaw the occult world, and provided some attempt (hardly successful) at rationalizing their relationships.  The contrast between The Initiates of 1908-1910 and this revived journal is striking: Clymer's overt ceremonial magic and sexual preoccupations are  less evident, and the myriad minor occult groups such as the Sons of Osiris, have largely vanished.  The entire run of the journal (1928-1941) was later reprinted in five volumes and sold by the Philosophical Publishing Company.
