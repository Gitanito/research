Publisher: J. Allen.  Succeeded by: Mercurius's Predicting Almanac (1876-1880)\n\n 1\/1, September 1857.  32 pp., 6d. an issue.  Edward Vaughn Williams (1817-before 1880), who described himself as Professor of Astral Prophecy and Professor of the Sidereal Art, was a practicing astrologer in London.  He proclaimed himself to be \"Successor to T[homas]. Oxley, Esq.\"  The journal was almost exclusively devoted to astrology but contained occasional articles or letters on the \"Botanical Practice of Physics\" and \"astro-phrenology.\"  Its real purpose seems to have been as an advertisement for Vaughan's New Calculating Instrument or Belt Planisphere (with explanatory key) to calculate nativities (priced \u00a32 10s to \u00a35) and for his services as an astrologer (one-year horoscope for \u00a31 1s 6d., life horoscope for \u00a35).  The journal seems to have struggled from the beginning and Vaughan was compelled to offer his services half off in exchange for a new paid subscription.  Williams figured as complaining witness in a criminal assault trial reported in the Birmingham Journal for January 26, 1850, when a relative of a man whose suicide Williams had predicted in his almanack the year before horsewhipped him.  At the trial Williams identified himself as the \"founder and President of the true Astral Prophetic Society, or School of Prophets of England,\" and bragged of the wonderful effects of his \"astro-medical botany\" which could \"relieve or completely cure any one suffering from any disease, no matter what doctors may have given them up.\" He acknowledged on the witness stand that he had not foreseen the horsewhipping.\n\n       Issues:Astrologers Magazine V1 N1 1857 Sep Astrologers Magazine V1 N2 1857 Oct Astrologers Magazine V1 N4 1858 Jan Astrologers Magazine V1 N6 1858 Mar Astrologers Magazine V1 N7 1858 Apr Astrologers Magazine V1 N8 1858 May      <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/astrologers_magazine_williams\/","_id":1190}
