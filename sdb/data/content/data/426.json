There waa an abundance of out-hoUBeB\nin a somewhat ruinous condition. The carriage-way had become a damp\nlane, Bometimea flooded in winter. But the building itBelf was sound-its\nWallB very thick. A tragedy had taken place therein nearly half a century\nbefore the date of which I write. A captain in his Majeaty'. Navy had lived\nthere with an amiable young wife, to whom he waa unfaithful to IUch an\nextent that, diBguiBing his marriage, he made an offer to another young lady,\nand waa on the point of committing bigamy. Indeed, the marriage cere-\nmony had actually begun, when the injured wife appeared on the 'scene and\nforbade ita completion. He ran away j eM returned home, and in her\ndiBtreu hung heraelf in a room at the extreme angle of the top Btorey of\nthe house.\nThe unhappy wife lies buried in a neighbouring churchyard with the\nfollowing epitaph :-\nReader!\nIf thou hast a heart famed for Tender-\nneBB and Pity, Contemplate this Spot,\nIn which are depoaited the Remaina of a\nYoung Lady, whose artIeBB Beauty, innocence\nof Mind, and gentle Mannera once obtained\nher the Love and Esteem of all who knew her j\nBut when Nervel were too delicately Bpun to\nbear the rude Shakea and J08tlings which we\nmeet with in this transitory World, Nature gave\nway; She Bunk R.Ild died a Martyr to\nEXceBBive Sensibility :\nMm.

Whatever it was that entered,\nit certainly po888ased force, for it puahed the open door of a wardrobe, which\nobatructed the passage, forcibly aside, and ahut it with a loud noise.

I cried aloud,\" Who is it 1\" and all waa silent. I\nsprang out of bed and searched the room and the adjacent paasages, but no\nelucidation of the mystery appeared.\nWhen I communicated my night's experience (very cautiously-for my\nfather had again and again forbidden such reports aa likely to alarm the boys\nand prejudice the school), I found that I had stumbled on a fact known to\nmany in secret-that at a quarter to three each morning these stepa paraded\nthe house, from the chamber where the suicide ....as committed to the room\nin ....hich I alept.\nAn aasistant muter informed me that, going upstairs at that hour, he\nhad met the stepe coming down and felt a cold blast of wind paas him, to his\nno small terror.

They\ncentred, it ie true, at the old hour, but were by no meanaconfined wit now.\n1 will give a few instances.\nMy brother told me that one night he was awoke by loud cries of terror\nfrom the boys who alept in the\" suicide's room,\" jUllt above his own.

I had gone to sleep in spite of it all-for it waa too\ncold to get up to investigate-when I heard the ringing of a bell in my room,\nwhich had been a servants' room, and communicated below. I got up and\nheard knocks upon the ceiling beneath my ftoor.\nAn invalid sister was then sleeping in the chamber beneath, and I\naccordingly put on my dressing-gown, went out into the bitter atmosphere\n(that night a policeman was frozen to death in his box not far off), descended\nthe staira, and went to the door of my sister's room\u2022\n.. Poor L. is so dreadfully alarmed by the noises,\" said my other sistsr,\nwho slept with her ; .. do see what it all means I\"\n\"It is usel888,\" I said, \"but I will go through the house to satisfy you\nthat there are no robbera in it.\" So I went through all the large rooms of\nthe empty house. I was the only man in it that night. All was quiet; and\nI went back to my sistera' door, and said, \"You need not fear; it is only the\nghosts. They can do us no harm while we trust in God !\" I then went back\nto my bed, but not to rest, for I was no BOoner asleep than I W88 awoke\nby a fearful craah I Outside my door was a large box; this appeared,\njudging by the BOund, to be lifted up several feet, and then allowed to fall\nheavily on the floor. I would not get up, and soon dozed off again. It 1fU\nrepeated a second time, with a deafening noise and shock. Still, I would\nnot get up, but, commending myself to God, slept again. A third time I\nwas awoke by the same shock.\nA sudden thought inapired me. I was a priest and might try what\nexorcism would do. So I used, as nearly as I could remember it, the ancient\nform commanding the spirits to depart in the name of the Father, Son, and\nHoly Ghost I And all waa quiet through ~e old house during the remainder\nof that night. In the morning I asked my sistera, \"Did you hear anything\nafter I left. you 1\" They replied, \" Yes, three heavy smashes; then all\nwas still.\"\nThis occurrence, more than aught else, led me to believe that the noisea\nwere the result of the !!gency of evil spirits.\nA friend, who is a great believer in Spiritualism, tells me that I ought to\nhave l1uestioned the ghosts, for they can open no COnIDlUnication, but\nevidently sought such opening ; and that I might have done good had I\naddre88ed them.\nTo conclude, from that night until we left the place it was the scene of\ncontinual disturbance. Our doora were tried at night; we saw the handles\nturn; steps continually paraded the passages; furniture appeared to be\nshifted, but never could we detect any visible agency. The most melancholy\noccurrence connected with these disturbances was as follows :-A poor boy\n\\\\'as left behind in the following Christmas holidays, suffering from conges-\ntioll of the lungs. He died, and one night, while the body was lying in\n110 room adjacent to my brother's study, such dismal noises issued from the\nchamber of death while my brother and his wife wero in their room, that\nthey could not bear it, and were obliged to go elsewhere.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept., 1886.] JO'UNUJl of Society 1m' PBychical Ruearclt. 391\n_o\\nd the moat significant thing occurred at the same trying II888On. My\nbrother was in town, and bia wife was sleeping alone when she heard lOunds\nall over the hoWl8, as if a number of carpenters and upholaterers were taking\ndown the furniture previous to removal. She heard them, as it seemed, take\ndown the bedsteads, and place the iron laths in succeuion on the floor with\ndistinct lOund. She lay terrified a long time, and then awoke a visitor who\nslept in the adjoining room. He, too, had heard all these noiaea with the\nutmost astonishment, greatly wondering what household arrangements thus\ninterfered with the rest which night should bring to all. These noiaea were\nevidently prophetic, for within a year fever broke out in the village, extend-\ning to the school, and coating us two or three lives; and my brother, under\nmedical advice, moved his whole establishment to a woll-known watering-\nplace on the South Cout, where it still flourishes.\nWe are all, from experience, what the world calla .. believel'll in ghOllts \" ;\nbut none of us have ever had such experiences elaewhere-a strong proof\nthat the occurrences I have detailed did not originate in our own imaginations.\nMarch, 1883.\nMr. A.

About midnight, 10011 after we all got to bed; there was a continuous\naeries of heavy noises in all the empty rooms, as if heavy bodies were lifted\nup, and then dashed violently against the floor. I slept in the Muter's\nroom and was alone upon the upper floor; it was intensely cold, and I had\ngot under a prodigious number of blankets, with a hot water apparatus at\nmy feet, 10 I was not much incline(l to move ; but presently a bell rang in my\nroom, and I quietly observed to myself, that the ghOllts were improving in\ntheir practice; but when I heard voices in the room below (occupied by my\naistel'll), I found they had rung the bell (by a wire), and that they were dread-\nfully alarmed by the noises; so I was forced to get up and IIC8ol'ch the hoWl8,\nverr ineffectually, until reporting all safe, I got into bed again, and was no\nIOOner warm than the malicious hobgoblins began as badly as ever. So I\nlaid a prayer against evil spirits. After this I heard no more, and slept com-\nfortably till daybreak. It was strange that at the moment I named, the\nnoises aeemed to cease everrwhere. At breakfast this moming we tried to\ndiacuaa the matter, but could come to no aatisfactorr conclusions; the noises\nwere unaccountable, 10 they must lie at the door of the same agoncies which\nUICd to disturb us so dreadfully ten or twelve ye&l'll ago.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\f392 Joo,1\"fW1, of Society for Psychical, &search.

The following notes of our\nconversation have been read through and corrected by him:-\nWhen he wrote that he could only give a geneml confirmation to the\naccount written by the Rev. A. D.

C. caDIlot\nprofe.. to remember all the details given; but he confirms in the fullest\nmanner his brother's account of the footfalls.\nThey went to the house in IMG, when Mr. E. E. C. was only four yean\nold. He distinctly remembers the incident narrated by his brother, vis..\nhearing the stepa come down to him at a time when he lay in the lower room,\nMr. E. E. C., indeed, frequently heard the stepa as 0. boy. He describes them\nas finn and determined, but not heavy-like a woman's footsteps. They\nalways began in No.9-the suicide's room-and went along an uncarpeted\npassage, and down two flights of uncarpeted stairs, passing through the\nlower bedroom-in which Mr. E. E. C. used at one time to sleep-into the\nboudoir, where they ceased. Thus, throughout the whole of this COI1l'll8 the\nboards were bare, and the stepa sounded like a woman's finn steps on boards;\nquite loud and unmistakeable. They never varied in their character, their\nCOI1l'll8, or their time. Mr. E. E. C. never heard them, and never learnt that\nanyone else heard them, at any other time than 2.45 Lm. He is unable to\nconceive any ordinary explanation for the noises. No mere creaking of wood,\nnoises of the wind, rats, or any other cause with which he is acquainted\ncould, in his opinion, account for them. On one occasion in particular,\nwhen about 16 years old, Mr. E. E. C., when sleeping in the lower room (on\nthe ground Hoor), woke up suddenly, with an indescribable feeling of terror.\nahivering all over, and then heard the steps coming along the pauage over-\nhead, and got out of bed to go upatairs to a cousin's room. He paued the\natepa, on this occaaion, on the stairs-he going up, the steps, apparently,\ncoming down.\nIt was about this time (1857, or thereabouts) that Mr. J. W., the senior\naaaistant master, and Mr. A. D. C., sat up to hear the steps. Mr. E. E. C.\ndid not himself sit up, but he distinctly remembers hearing from Mr. W. and\nhis brother an account of their adventures the next day.\nHe also recollects on many occasions hearing visitors asking who had\nbeen walking about the house in the middle of the night; and, whenever the\ntime could be accurately fixed, it was found to be the aame-2.45 a.m.\nItwas in 1866 that Mr. E. E. C. married, and took the charge of the school\nDuring the first year or 80 of their married life, he and his wife lived in a\ncottage in the village, 80 that he was not himself a witneu of the noises.\nThe incident of the boys being alarmed he recollects, however; md it\nmust, therefore, have occurred rather later. The boys told him that someone\nhad come into the room ; but on questioning, he ascertained that they had\nonly heard stepa Zeaml1g the room, and had drawn the inference that someone\nmust have come in~ the room before. Nothing, he thinks, was said about\na figure being .teen by any boy. But it is pouible that some nervous &mall\nboy may.have made the statement referred to by Mr. A. D. C.

D. C.'s account is\ndead.\nThe _\" (not midwife), who was a complete stranger in the neighbour-\nhood, stated to him, on being questioned, that she had merely heard sounds\nof someone Uatnt'!l the room. She said that she would prefer-if there was\nno other room for her-to sleep on the door mat outside Mr. E. E. C.'s\nroom. This W'aI! in 1867.\nMr. E. E. C. can recollect hearing from both hia brother and the two\naiaters (one dead, one at Oxford), their accounts of the noises and the\nexorcism, but he was not himself present in the house ; nor can he recollect\nhow the noises were described at that time.\nIn general Mr. E. E. C. can only recollect hearing the steps. He never\nhimself saw handles turned, or doors opened, or heard the noises as of\nfurniture being shifted. Nor can he remember the noises i88uing from the\n\"chamber of death \" referred to. Indeed, it is very unlikely that such\nnoises would have been heard unle88 extremely loud. The room in which\nthe dead body was placed was situated at the extreme end of a long and\nrambling pile of buildings, in the same wing as hia study, but at the opposite\nextremity, and far away from the bedroom occupied by himself and hia wife.\nMrs. E. E. C., who has read through Mr. A. D. C.'s account, told her\nhusband that she well recollected the noises as of bedsteads being moved,\n&c., but that in her opinion they were due to ordinary causes. Tho sounds\noccurred in an exceptionally stomly winter (Christmas, 18(7), and no doubt\nwind amongst the trees, and in the roof, was responsible for moet of the\nsounds.\nIn this same winter, however, Mr. E. E. C. sat up each night during\nhis wife's. illne88, reading in his study, and would hear the steps go along\nthe passage and down the stairs on moat of the nights of his vigil. They\nwere always heard at the same time. If nothing had happened by 3 a.m.\nMr. E. E. C. knew that nothing would happen, and would go to bed.\nMr. B., a relative of the boy who died, stayed in the house before\nthe death, and on one occaeion came to Mr. E. E. C.'s room in tho middle of\nthe night to ask if anyond had gone down to the boy, as he had heard some-\none paaaing down the stairs. Mr. E. E. C. then looked at his watch, found it\nwas just past 2.45 a.m., and was able to assure his visitor that no one had\nstirred, and that the steps would not be heard again that night.\nMr. E. E. C. is decidedly of opinion that the footsteps were not of physical\norigin. He has had no other experience of the kind, and has never been\nthe subject of a ha.llucination.\nMr. E. E. C., as a boy, heard the story of the suicide from James, an\nold inhabitant of the village-of the labouring claaa-who died in about\n1856, at the age of between 90 and 100.

E. E. C., and A. D. C., who were then young, IDd\nresident at C. I waa told, shortly after becoming an inmate of their\nfather's house, that it waa subject to sundry disturbances, one of which\nin particular took place aa a rule ahortly before 3 in the morning. I\nagreed with the elder brother-now a vicar in W--- dioceae-to\ndevote one night to a careful watch. I do not think anyone knew of\nour intention. The room in which we Bat was, perhaps, about BlIven\nyards from the top of the stair\u00b7ffight where the foot-stepa were said to\ncommence.\" * At the given time-I think 15 minutes t<> 3-foot-atepl,\n.. of a high-heeled boot were heard descending the stair : they were followed\nby the younger gentleman, while I remained above to see it was no com\u00b7\nbination or trickery.

D. 0., and\n.ascending the stair as before, died away about the second knob from the\ntop of the balustrade.* I think these were the plain facts of that evening'l\nvigil. I ought, perhaps, to add that the lmall room known as the \"ante-\nn>om\" had a large nail in its wall, bent down by lOme heavy weight. It\nwas said that a man \"little of ltature\" had hanged himlelf thereon.t Of\ncourse I cannot vouch for this having been the case. But I do aver that\nwhen the said .. ante-room\" became my own bed-chamber, the presence of\n-the said \"nail,\" of the lize ulually known as \"tenpenny,\" was IOmewhat\nundesirable, from its MIOCiation with the above rumour. But I would not\nmake request for its removal ; deeming it better to forget its presence than\n.Yield to a groundlelB fear of the intangible. I may not say how many timel,\nwhile lying there, I have heard the same creaking tramp of footsteps up to\nmy door, then deliberately back to the same point of the ItaiN.t At first I\n-was gravely annoyed, and would unclose tho door (which opened outwardly)\nwith ludden jerk, vainly thinking to trip up lOme IOmnambuliat, perchance;\nbut the steps retraced their normal way, while I looked on nothing save the\navenue np which they had glided. Once or twice I followed them up the\n.tair by the moon-rays or with a candle; but alwaYI with the same effect-\nthe dying away of the Itrange noise upon the return flight of the ItaiN, and\na Ihort distance from its lummit. After I had occupied the room in question\nlor lOme considerable period, probably two or three Ye&l\"l, an alteration was\neffected during the Midsummer vacation. The plaster of the \"ante-room\"\nwall being in parts broken,-Ipecially round the nail, whose presence had\nbecome to me a thing of course-it was restored, previous to the painting\n.of the room ; and on my return after the month'l absence the bent nail was\ngone. I had nothing to do with its removal; pro\\lably it was thought un-\noBightly and unneceuary. But after that I cannot remember hearing the\n.duceJtding \"foot-ateps on the ltain\" again.\u00a7 I have watched for them\nwhen my avocation rendered it advisable to rise at an unusually early hour,\nbut they came not, as, with measured and privileged tramp up to the door,\nothey had done till the removal of the \"bent nail.\" I look upon this as\n-the appendix of what yon have termed our\" vigil.\" I don't know if what\nI am about to relate may be termed a \"vigil,\" as we had on this occasion\n-no intention of watching.

One of us mounted on ..\nbed (there was an empty bed each lide of the door) and looked out of the\n\" borrowed lights\" that had been opened on the paBIIBgE-I presume in the\ndaYI of the obnoxious window-duty-and round from the ltair head came the\nsound or lemblance of something whose weight rendf'red it difficult to draw ;\nbut distinctly between the attempts to overcome the inertia were heard the\nshuftlings, mumed and dabbled, of what seemed the bearer'l feet. The\npauage where they passed was almost brilliant with the rays, direct or re-\nHooted, of an August moon, so that any practical joke would have been im-\npollible. After the labouring paces had leemingly IUCCeeded in reaching a\nroom that was for the night unoccupied, through the non-arrival of one viMtor,\nthere commenced upon the panell of its door, for it may be two or three\ncousecutive minutes, a distinct Icratching, all of iron talons, from top to\nHoor, then a fall of the body, and a return down the pauage in the l&IDe\nfallhion as before. I need not aay the unusual noise left us in a ltate by no\nmeans enviable. I think tha.t one of us Wall awakened by the other who first\nheard the noise on the ltair. On the following night the other * brother of\nthe family watched with me j though we had 110 intention of leaving the\nroom we did not think it necelBary to \"lit up,\" but occupied our several\nbeds-I can scarcely aay rested in them. We took certain precautions to\nmake ounelvesdoubly lure there was no collusion, or rather to detoct\nany if it existed, which Wall altogether improbable. About the same time\ncommenced the weird loundl from the fatal knob upon the ltair-ftight, the\nlabouring efforts to drag lOme unwieldy body upwards, then the Houndering\nupon the puaage-Hoor, the slow advance all on the previous night up to the\ndoor of the end room, and the return j but, to my dismay, this time the\nBOund came through tM door of our dormitory t to within a few yards of our\nbedl j and after what seemed a fierce scufHe of protracted length over a p&rt\nof the Hoor that had been replaced with deal, when certain ltains had been\nfound indelible, they went out, leaving the idea of soddened footsteps fresIl\nfrom a slaughter-house.

The time of our \"vigil\" was the night of\n-.June. 1854.. 1\u00a3it be asked how I remember, I reply that it was a week or\nthereabouts before the commencement of the first Midsummer holidays after\nmy becoming \"aaaiata.nt master\" there. I went there in March, 1854. .As\nthe holidays generally commenced about the 15th of June, it must, there-\nfore, have been about a week after the beginning of that month. 1 am not\n10 clear as to the year in which the othel\u00b7 event was registered in memory,\nbut from concurrent circumata.nces, judge it could not have been later tha.n\n1856, a.nd as it succeeded the Midsummer holidays it was probably early in\nthe August of that year. The two consecutive nights alluded to were those\nof the Saturday a.nd Sunday.\n(2.) I cannot remember mentioning the matten, either at the time of their\noccurrence or otherwise, in writing. Being aware that in some inata.nces the\nsupposition of the place being \"haunted\" might prove detrimental, I should\nhave restrained a.ny tendency to &8Iiat in sprea.ding it. Neither did I keep a\ndiary. I can remember being questioned by the \"le8888 It of the house as\nto a.ny \"experience\" I might have ha.d there, a.nd cautioned to \"keep dark\"\non the matter.\n(3.) The elder brother was with me (we did not then\" sit up \") cn the\nevening of the first of the two consecutive nights to which I have a.dverted,\nthe Saturday evening. I suppose this may not be material, as to the beat of\nmy knowledge or recollection one slept in the room on the Saturday and the\nother on the following night. I do not think I could affirm positively which on\nwhich night. The room on the door of which the \"acra.tching\" took place\nwas void 011 the Sunday evening, through one visitor, who was expected,\nhaving wa.lked on to his hoUle instea.d of halting at C. for the night.

It formed the\ncomer j one window giving on the Piazza, the other on the Chiaja, and many\nan hour have I spent at my window watching the blue wavea of the tideleaa\nsea, 88 they danc8d in the golden sunshine, or the silvery moonlight. \" A\nNapoli non e mai notte,\" I once heard a man exclaim under my window,\nand the proverbially merry Neapolitans sang, twanged their guitars, and\nchattered the greater part of the night.\nMy powen of sleeping forsook me, not only on account of the varying\n80unds already deacribed, added to the constant rumbling of beavy carta laden\nwith 1lax at this season of the year, but also on account of the well-known\nexcitable properties of the Neapolitan atmosphere. I W88 very sleepleaa.\nBeing obliged to leave my window open on account of the heat, I could not\ndarken the room without excluding the air, and every object in it W1I8 there-\nfore partially visible.\nThere W88 but a short space between my mother's door and my aiater's\ndoor, which were situated at right anglea to each other in a comer of my\nroom, and every night during the four months I spent at Naples, the figure\nof a woman paaaed through these doors, which were always left open.\nIn the uncertain light I could only see that the form W88 that of a\nwoman apparently young from the outline and movement. Atfirst I thought\nit was my aiater and called to her, but, receiving no answer, supposed she\nhad not heard me. For a few nights I paid little attention to the circum-\nstance, 88 there were four women in the house besides myself, and it might\neuily have been one of these, but gradually I became attracted with the\npeculiar gliding movement of the figure, and the fact that I never received\nan answer to my constant challenge of \"Who's there 1\". I resolved on the\nnext opportunity to jump from my bed and follow the intruder into my\naiater's room. I did 80 more than once, and each time the form vanished on\nthe threshold. I thought it better not to mention the circumstance to the\nservants, leut of all to the Neapolitan, but I spoke of it to my mother and\naiater, who both laughed at my superstitious fears. A little offended by\nthis, I entered no more on the subject with them, for indeed I had no fears.\nThe appearance of my mysterious visitor did not cause an extra beat to my\nheart or pulse, but I set to work to argue with myself the poaBibility of the\nwhole affair being a freak of the imagination, and I thought \"I will look up\nand see her now.\" She did not come at my bidding, and later on, when\nplunged in a reverie respecting my favourite brother at achool in England, or\nin recalling the delights of a moonlight ride on the preceding evening-then,\nwhen I had quite forgotten Her, I heard the rustle, raised my head, and\nsaw her paa8 through the accustomed door.\n202\nDigitized by Google\n\f404 JO'Urnal of Society for Psychical Research.

(\" Aus Meiner Erfahrung. Philo-\nlogische Rii.thsel Mediumistisch Aufgegeben,\" by the Editor.)\nM. Akaakof and his sister-in-law, a lady of 40, and his step-son, a young\nman of 20, had held a series of sitt.ings, in which communicatioll8 in various\nlanguages had been received through table tiltinga, and through a planchette,\nwhich stood upon a card on which was printed the French and Ruaian\nalphabets.\nAt the 57th seance a request was made through tilts for the RUBBian\nalphabet. After some RU88ian sentences had been given, pIanchette turned\nto the French alphabet. M. Akaakof took no mediumistic part in the\nexperiments, but sat at another table, writing down the letters pointed out\nby planchette, and which one of the mediums dictated to him.\nThe following were the letters which he wrote down ;-\nemekhabaccha\nwhich was said by:pIanchette to be a Hebrew saying, signifying \"the Vale\nof Tears.\"\nM. Akaakof requested that the sentence might be repeated in the Ruaaian\nalphabet.\nThis was done. (The mediums who dictated the letters without under-\nstanding what they meant, could not have done this themselves, and they\ndid not see the note-book.)\ngitized by (.oogI\n\fSept.,1886.] Journal of SocUty for Psychical Research. 405\nOn beiDg asked where these worde came from, a reply waa received that\nthey were a well-known saying of a Portuguese Jewish doctor, whOle name-\nplanchette believed-wD8 .. Sardovy.\"\nHere the .ea.nce waa interrupted by tea. M. Akaakof turned at once to\na Hebrew lexicon, and found the sentence\" emek habacca \"-\" Vale of\nTears.\" He further learnt from the dictionary that the sentence occurs only\nonce in the Old Testament, namely, ill the 84th Psalm, verae 7.\nThe saying waa quite unknown to M. Akaakof. It waa 30 yeara since\nhe had studied Hebrew a little, and he had never advanced beyond the first\nchapter of Genesis, and the first ten paalma. The quotation waa right, but\nfor the change of \u2022habacca' to \u2022habaccha. ' And turning to a French\ntranalation by Cahen of the Hebrew Bible, M. Akaakof found these\nworde tranalated \"la valllSe de Bacha,\" in which the syllable \"ca\" waa\nspelt .. cha.\"\nHe could not find the name Sardovy in a biographical lexicon. Re-\nturning to the .ea.nce-room, he found that the mediums had re-seated them-\nselves at the table, and that planchette had jU8t spelt out, .. Look in the\ndictiona.ry for B. Cardosio.\" As M. Akaakof sat down planchette continued,\n\" I remember that the name is not Sardovy, but Cardovy j but no, I am still\nmaking a mistake, he is called Cardosy,\" and then going over to the Latin\nalphabet-\" Cardosio b.\" On being D8ked what b signified, planchette\ncontinued, .. His name-B. Cardosio, a lelU'Ded doctor. who in his time\nwas well-known.\" Being D8ked as to the connection between this and the\nHebrew letters, planchette replied, .. A celebrated motto.\"\nAt the conclusion of the .ea.nce M. Akaakof consulted Didot's Nouvelle\nBiographie Unitlerlelle, and found :-\"Cardoso (Fernando), Portuguese doctor,\nborn about the beginning of the 17th century . . . who won great fame\nin his profession. . . \u2022 It WD8 a curious fact in the life of this IIImtlt\nthat he gave up the Christian religion to return to the Jewish creed. . . \"\nThis time, therefore, the surname and the characteristic details were\nright, the only mistake being in the Christian name, which WD8 of little\nimportance. Whether the motto WD8 really much used by Cardoso, one\ncannot tell without a perusal of his works, and this M. Akaakof has had no\nopportunity of accomplishing.\nM. Akaakof calla the attention of those who would view this occurrence\naa transference of a latent thought, to the following points :-That hiahands\ndid not touch planchette, that he sat at another table, and was isolated from\nall contact with the mediums j that the name WD8 given first D8 Sardovy, then\nCardovy, and lastly D8 Cardosio, with details of the biography of a man\nwh08e name even was not mentioned in ordiaary biographical dictionaries j\nthat had the Hebrew worde come from him, he would have been able to say\nwith certainty that the sentence was in the Old Testament, or with greater\nprecision still, in the Psalms. No other sources were known to him; he\nnever would have connected the words with a Jewish Portuguese doctor; he\nwould never have aBBerted that the motto WD8 Cardosio's, when the name\neven was unknown to him.\nThere is a logical impouibility in such a view, which M. Akaakof believes\ngitized by (.oogI\n\f406 Journal of SocUty JOT Psychical &search.

Aksa.kof. He repeats that hiB knowledge of Hebrew was of a most\nelementary nature, enabling him with the help of a dictionary to pick\nout a few words only. His step-son knew no Hebrew.\nHe wishes to call especial attention to a point which he regrets\nhaving omitted to comment upon in his original paper, namely, that\neven though it were possible to suppose that the Hebrew words could\nhave been unconsciously impressed on his brain, there is a very much\nlarger assumption involved, if it be maintained that the meaning conld\nlikewise have been unconsciously impressed.\nJ. H.s.\nM. Aksakof writes on the 17th August, 1886:-\nI have been in the British Museum and found there some of the worka of\nFen14ndo CardolO, namely :-\n1. De las utilidades del Agua, Madrid, 1637.\n2. Discorso sobre el Vesuvio, Madrid, 1632.\n3. Philosophia libera, Venetiiz, 1673.\n4. Las Excellencias de los Hebreos, Amsterdam, 1678.\nThe last two works were published by him under the name of IIQ.C,\nCardoso, after baving embraced the Hebrew religion, and are, I think, the\nmost important. I have perused all the four volumes, but did not find the\nmotto.\nAocording to the Biog-raphie Univer&elle de Michaud (nouvt'lle Mition),\nthere are some other works of Cardoso, and among them are given the titles\nof: \"De febri syncopei,\" Madrid, 1634. \"Panegyrico del color verde,\" ib.\u2022\n1635, which arc not in the Library of the British Museum.\nAnd so, however, it is not positively proven, but I am inclined to conclude\nthat the reference, as regards the motto, is wrong. Its confinnation would\nbe valuable, but the important point remains (Cardoso's name, with particu-\nlars, &c.).\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYOHICAL REsLutCH.\nSu,-Like many others I must submit to hard names and be considered\n\" unreliable\" ; as this was exactly my attitude not long ago towards the\nSpiritualists, I deserve all I get.

THE SocnrrY POR PSYCHICAL RESBARCB.\nSm,-As I find Mrs. Sidgwick's letter in your last Journal (for August)\nwould lead to, indeed seems to rest upon, a misconception of my previous note\nin BOme particulars, I now wish as shortly I\\B poBBible to make my sense clearer.\nMrs. Sidgwick says that I have expressed \"surprille that a believer in\ntelepathy should feel any difficulty in lIoCCepting Mr. Eglinton's phenomena\nas genuine.\" I never used the word \"genuine,\" for which the substitution of\nthe word pollible would be correct ; and I made no reference whatever to\n\"telepathy,\" but to one special case of planchette-writing, well-known as\nthe NeumlIam, to which a considerable part of the first half-yeal\"ly report for\n1885 was devoted. It is no simple case of telepathy, but a much more\ninvolved example of those psychical puzzles the Society have I18t themselves\nthe task of explaining. True, telepathy may account for the unconscious\ntransference of thought in the first place from Mr. Newnham to his wife, the\nmedium ; but after that several unknown psychical proceBBes are required to\ncomplete the chain which ends in a written answer to an unknown question.\nFor at no time does Mrs. Newnham have any conscious idea of her husband's\nailent questioning. Each question therefore received, let us say telepathically,\nby Mrs. Newnham had to be submitted unconsciously to her sub-conscious\nself, an answer found, and still again transmitted by unconscious muscular\naction to the planchette pencil (1), such answer finally from its immorality\nbeing unrecognisable by Mr. Newnham as that at all likely to come from his\nwife. So curious an illustration of psychical power cannot be passed out\nof argument as simply\" telepathy.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick then goes on to hint that perhaps I mean that \"anyone\ntaking one step away from scientific orthodoxy\" (as with her belief in the\nNewnham marvels)-\" accepting as a truth anything not generally admitted\nby scientific men-is logically bound to believe everything else.\" Of course\nnot. My argument WI\\B rather this : that, given a certain series of reported\nand unusual phenomena bearing a great impreasion oj exterior resemblance and\nclOle relation, yet of an incredible nature, it would be just and scientific that\nan investigator hitherto a stranger and disbeliever in all, should, on finding\none to be true-however explained-at least for a little suspend judgment or\nbe careful in rejecting the reat--alao poSBibly true, however explained. I\nconsider myself quite justified in seeing on the face of things some resem-\nblance between the Newnham case and Mr. Eglinton's occult writing as\nreported, inasmuch \/loB in the latter there is only an extended or additional\ninvisible as well as unconscious power over a pencil for the answering of\nunknown questions. But Mrs. Sidgwick had, as I am rather glad to record\nagain, .. no huitation\" at all in ascribing slate-writing to conjuring, a very\ndi1l\"erent position indeed from that of adepts themselves in conjuring such\nDigitized by Google\n\f408 Journal 0\/ Society \/0'1' Psychical Resea,'Ch. [Sept.,188&.\nas Angelo J. Lewis (Profe880r Hoft'man) and Dr. Hel'llChell, and far more,\nfrom that of lOme eminent authorities in lIOience.\nStill, after all, I think Mn. Sidgwick in these worda and verdict jut\nquoted surely oventates her inward convictions as to possibilities. For I\nread in her last letter that ahe has been investigating Spiritualism for 12\nyean. This presents to me a picture of a very rema.rkable period of hesita-\ntion, not likely either, I fully believe, to be BOOn ended. The facta remain\nand increase, yet being of 10 delicate a kind, requiring diapaaaionate,\neven sympathic interest for the time, will ever remain a riddle to those who\napproach them with the moods of mind which are represented by hard and\nfast outward conclusions and condescending criticism.\nI need not enter into what would become IUl interminable argument upon\nmethods of investigation. The suggestion Mn. Sidgwick makes is a good one,\nbut if succeaaful is not neceaaarily, I fear, convincing.
