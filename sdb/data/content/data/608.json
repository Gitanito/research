D. HOME.\nBy Sik Oliver Lodge.\nPART I.\nThe so-caUed \" physical phenomena \" of SpirituaHsm have\nhitherto attracted but httle scientific attention in this\ncountry : and even as regards popular attention they\nhave been less welcome than the more purely mental\nor psychic communications which seem to have a bearing\non human destiny and survival. Physical phenomena of\nthis peculiar and unusual kind labour under certain dis-\nadvantages. They are rather easily imitated, for one\nthing, or at least they attract the attention and arouse\nthe ingenuity of skilled conjiu-ers to see how closely they\ncan be produced by normal means. And since very few\nof those who have had an opportunity of observing them\nhave had a laboratory training or been accustomed to\nlearn from actual experiments ; and since most people,\nincluding physicists, are aware that conjurers under their\nown conditions are able to deceive them ; there has\nusually been a doubt as to the actual occurrence of any\nabnormal physical phenomenon apart from conscious\nhuman contrivance. And this uncertainty has prevented\na very whole-hearted attempt to bring such things to\nbook and ascertain their laws.\nFor laws, of course, they must have ;\nthough inasmuch\nas the activity of live things is involved, those laws are\n\f2 Sir Oliver Lodge\nbound to be complicated by the general difficulties in-\nseparable from the activities of hfe. Live things are\nusually excluded from a physical laboratory. The observer\nexcludes even himself during extremely dehcate weighings\nor temperature determinations ; he may have to read a\nscale through a telescope from the other end of a corridor.\nAnd even in ordinary experiments, a buzzing fly or a\nspider's web would be more than a nuisance in a scientific\ninstrument. Charwomen and mischievous students could\nplay havoc with a simple meteorological observation. A\nphysical experimenter always proceeds on the assumption\nthat vital activities have been excluded, or he takes\nprecautions to exclude them. Experiments on spontaneous\ngeneration were for a long time vitiated by the unwanted\nbut overlooked incursion of hving organisms. But\u2014in\ncontrast with all that,\u2014in the particular class of observa-\ntion with which psychical research is concerned, a hving\norganism of some kind is bound to be introduced, or\nnothing happens. Everyone admits that. The question\nis, what sort of a hve agency is operating ? Is it an\ningeniously fraudulent one, or is it of an unknown and\nunsuspected kind ?\nWe may sa3^ that in the p^^rely physical world nothing\nsupernormal ever happens. And even in the psychic\nworld there is no question of superseding the laws of\nPhysics and Chemistry : we must assume that they can\nonly be supplemented. There should be no suspicion or\nsuggestion about suspending Gravitation, for instance, or\nuj)setting the Conservation of Energy. It ought to be\nassumed that aU well ascertained laws are rigorously\nobeyed, whether by animate or inanimate nature. But\nit is a famihar fact that hve things introduce a supple-\nmentary element, a guiding or controlhng element, an\ninfusion of will and of intelhgence, something not sus-\npending but supplementing the ordinary processes of\nnature. Everyone knows how perturbing a kitten or a\nbarrel-organ or a mosquito can be : their action is en-\ntirely commonplace, and in the case of the kitten may be\nattractive, but they introduce a perturbing element\nbecause of the spontaneous and incalculable character of\n\fIntroduction 3\ntheir movements. I do not suppose that even Laplace's\nCalculator could predict the orbit of a fly, or predetermine\nthe vibrations of air caused by an itinerant vendor.\nSo also hve people can lift stones that would not other-\nwise have been lifted, they can light or extinguish a fire,\ncan penetrate mountainous obstacles, divert the course of\nrivers, unite oceans, amend unhealthy climates, and do\nmany other things ; not by suspending but by modifying\nand perturbing the direct incidence of the laws of nature.\nMoreover, apart from perturbation, hving processes are\nwell known to produce curious results, such as birds'\nnests, honeycombs, pictures, and cathedrals. Physics and\nChemistry are therefore insufficient in the examination of\nvital phenomena : they must be supplemented by Physio-\nlogy and by Psychology. Furthermore, if it should turn\nout that any unknown intelligent agencies exist, even\nthough they be only of the animal or savage order, they\nmight conceivably produce results akin to those suggested\nabove ; but their incursion would make scientific examina-\ntion difficult, and would inevitably have a deterrent\ninfluence on an investigator, so long as the agencies were\nunknown.\nIn Psychical Research we set out with the intention of\nnot excluding unknown activities ; we are engaged in\nexamining the behaviour of specially endowed hving\npeople. Even in experiments on the purely mental side\nwe have to introduce \" a sensitive,\" that is someone\nwith exceptional faculties, often called a \" medium.\"\nAnd the precautions necessary to ensure the honesty of\nsuch a person, though necessary, are inevitably distasteful.\nNevertheless, on the purely mental side, precautions are\nfairly easy ;\naccordingly such things as Telepathy and\nClairvoyance, and the action of the subconscious generally,\nhave been seriously tackled ; and some progress has been\nmade. There are still some die-hards, but few responsible\npeople now doubt that there are genuine phenomena to\nbe investigated ; and though we are well aware that we\nhave, as yet, no adequate theory to cover the ground\ncompletely, we can proceed by the method of working\nhjrpothesis, we feel at hberty to suggest an experi-\n\f4 Sir Oliver Lodge\nmental theory, to be amended or modified as experience\ngrows.\nOn the physical side of these phenomena, however, we\nin this country, and presumably in America also, have\nmade less progress.\nThe Society for Psychical Research has not ignored\nthe subject, but its experience has been in some respects\nunfortunate ; and accordingly some of its skilled investi-\ngators, who are quite entitled to their opinion, do not\nshare my views, or at least might express their present\nconvictions differently. It would be safe to say that\nseveral members of Council are still in a state of doubt\nabout the occurrence of psycho-physical phenomena in\ngeneral ; hence nothing I say need be taken as repre-\nsenting any view held by the Society as a whole. The\nSociety as a whole preserves an open mind and would\nwelcome good opportunities for investigating abnormal\nphysical phenomena. Some of the members imagine that\nthe positive results obtained by others are due to a\nlack of adequate precaution against trickery ! Others\nconjecture that so-called precautionary measures may be\npushed to such excess as to frustrate the object in view\nand to inhibit the occurrence of genuine phenomena.\nIt is better to err on the side of excessive caution than\nof over-credulity, but it is difficult to form an opinion\non purely negative results. The subject has been seriously\nattacked in Europe by physiologists and qualified medical\nmen, as well as by a few others of different or more\ngeneral training ;\nthey have endeavoured to ascertain\nsomething of the laws of the phenomena, and responsible\npublications embody some of their results. In this country,\n\u2014apart from some laborious and cautious reports by\nOfficials and Members of the Society for Psychical Re-\nsearch, e.g. a long report by Messrs. Feilding, Baggally\nand Carrington, in Volume XXIII. of the Society's Pro-\nceedings,\u2014that branch of the subject has hitherto been\nleft mainly to amateurs, whose testimony to odd and\ninexplicable occurrences is voluble and extensive, but\nhas for the most part been recorded in such a way as\nnot to attract the attention of men of science, or at any\n\fIntroduction 5\nrate not to attract it in a favourable manner. And\nmany of the asserted phenomena have been more or less\nclosely imitated, with considerable mgenuity, on the\nconjuring stage.\nTo this statement about scientific aloofness there have\nbeen some exceptions. Every now and then a medium\nhas arisen possessing abnormal faculties to so great an\nextent that a few scientific men have felt it their duty to\nexamine and report ; chief among them being Sir William\nCrookes. Such men have suffered for their temerity.\nTheir testimony has not been widely accepted. Their\nefforts to mduce others of their fraternity to come and\nverify the facts have usually been unsuccessful. And\nso the effort has exhausted itseh in a kind of sterility,\nleaving no group or school of investigators to carry\non the work. In time this recurrent barrenness must\nterminate, either in the discovery that all these observa-\ntions are ill-founded and that no such phenomena occur,\nor\u2014as is much more liliely\u2014in repeated confirmation of\nthe fact that the phenomena are real, and can gradually\nbe subjected to the reign of law and order.\nScientific men on the Continent have seriously taken\nthe subject up. Institutes have been founded for the\nprosecution of the enquiry, and devoted experimenters are\nsacrificing their careers and incurring odium and ridicule\nin their endeavour to explore, verify, and enlarge this\nnascent and puzzling branch of science. It can only be\nby the combination of a number of workers of different\naptitudes and knowledge, all possessing first-hand acquaint-\nance with the disputed facts, that anything like a satis-\nfactory treatment can at length be achieved. One of\nthe first things that a would-be investigator has to do\nis to make himself acquainted with the first-hand testimony\nof responsible and trustworthy predecessors, especially\nthose who have had an opportunity of examining the\nmore powerful mediums who from time to time have\narisen in the past.\nAssuming any of these wonder-workers to be genuine,\nthat is to say assuming that they are not consciously\nor maliciously prodixcing their effects, it is safe to say\n\f6 Sir Oliver Lodge\nthat they understand them as little as anyone else. While\nthey are being produced, the ostensible producers are\nfor the most part unconscious or only semi-conscious :\ntheir organism is not wholly under thek own control.\nThe appearance is as if it were utilised by other intelli-\ngences,\u2014intelUgences it may be of a low order, possibly\nnot even human,\u2014superhuman or infra-human. So, as\nin cases of multiple personaUty and other pathological\nphenomena, the investigation must be conducted, not by\nthe patient, but by the qualified practitioner who examines\nand reports on the case. And inasmuch as the qualified\npractitioner cannot be always present, and cannot himself\nobserve all the phases of the disorder, he must make\nsuch use as he can of the testimony of friends and\nrelations, or of those who have been most closely associ-\nated with the individual durmg the access.\nThe physical mediums who have quite recently been\nexamined and reported on by trained observers are known\nin this branch of scientific literature by such names\nas Eusapia Palladino, Miss Goliglier, Eva C, Willy S.,\nKluski, Guzik, etc. And although it may be casually\nand hastily thought that everyone of these has been\nexposed or exploded, that is not really a considered and\nreasonable and legitimate view. We have to be on our\nguard against deception, but it is not really reasonable\ngratuitously to suppose that an individual starts out on\na career of that kind, and subjects him or herself to\nall the minute and repulsive precautions which have to\nbe taken, without any kind of foundation in reality.\nTo those who resolutely shut their minds to evidence,\nand decide beforehand that they know what is possible\nand what is impossible, neither this record nor any other\nbook on the subject will have any interest. But to\nthose who, preserving an open mind and not coming to\nhasty conclusions, are impressed with the fact that these\nthings have been asserted for very many years by many\ndifferent people,\u2014some who have attained distinction in\nother branches of knowledge and who have suffered for\nthen' conscientious testimony to what they conceive to be\ntruth,\u2014this book will be a useful compendium of direct\n\fIntroduction 7\nfirst-hand observation witli an exceptional medium, un-\npretentiously and contemporaneously recorded.\nIt has long been known to psychical researchers that\nsuch a record, privately printed, was in existence. And\nmany of them must have seen and perhaps read a copy.\nBut the copies were not accessible to the public, nor\nindeed in any convenient way to enquirers. Existing\ncopies are few m number, and only to be found in\nspecial libraries. Consequently when the present Earl of\nDunraven told me some years ago that he thought it was\nperhaps his duty to make accessible the diary which he\nwrote at the request of his father, to whom he reported\ndaily, I heartily welcomed the suggestion.\nThere were difficulties about carrying out the proposal ;\nbut Lord Dunraven thought he owed it to the memory\nof his father that this contemporary record of observed\nphenomena should not be lost to Science, especially now\nthat the subject was being seriously investigated and\nsimilar experiences testified to by others, so that there\nwas some chance now of taking it out of the sporadic\nunintelhgible stage of mere observation, and bringing it\ngradually into the realm of organised science. This may\nbe a slow process ; but a beginning has been made.\nSome of us are beginning to think that what \" telepathy\n\"\nhas proved to be to the more psychic side of the enquiry,\n\" ectoplasm \" may prove to be on the more physical or\nphysiological side.\nA discussion of that, or any of the theoretical aspects,\nis beyond my intention now, and beyond the scope of\nthis book. What we are concerned with here is a record\nof the facts themselves. And all that I want to do in\nthis Introduction is to state that facts of a similar kind\nhave been observed both before and since, and to give\nbrief references to samples of those observations. This I\nwill do in the Second Part of this Introduction. I will\nconclude this First Part by briefly saying, what appears\nmore fully elsewhere, that the late Earl of Dunraven was\nat one time keenly '\ninterested in Home's phenomena,\nand that his son, the present Earl, then Viscount Adare,\nfilially shared in this interest, to the extent of partially\n\f8 Sir Oliver Lodge\nliving with Home, keeping a record of the odd things\nthat happened in his presence, and transmitting them\nregularly to his father. It is of this calm and collected\nrecord, made without decorations or exclamations of\nastonishment or any other perturbing emotions, that the\nbook consists.\nI ought also to say that the more striking things\noccurred when Home was in trance, apparently under\ncontrol by some other intelligence, and speaking of him-\nseK in the thu-d person as \" Dan.\" Whether the usual\n'\ncontrol ' himself had any ostensible name, I do not know ;\nnor does it matter. But, to understand the record, it\nmust be known that Home under control called himself\nDan, his name being Daniel Dunglas Home. In this\nstate he was probably unconscious of his actions ; and\nit was clear that his body or physiological organism in\nthe controlled state possessed unusual powers and pro-\nperties. It could stand fire, for instance : it could be\nlevitated : it could even seem to be elongated, and be\nmade to do other things which in its normal state were\nimpossible. It could apparently be made to do things\nwhich most people only dream they are able to do, such\nas float in space.\nOne obvious quasi explanation will be, as it often has\nbeen, suggested,\u2014that the observers were under hypnotic\ncontrol, that they suffered from hallucination, and, so to\nspeak, only dreamed the things. Well, that is one of the\nhypotheses that has to be met. There may be instances\nto which it applies. But I am convinced that to the\ngreat bulk of the phenomena known to me it does not\napply. And this opinion was shared by the high authority\nof the late Lord Rayleigli, who, in testifying to such\nexperience as he had had of supernormal physical pheno-\nmena, condemned the hypothesis of hallucination in his\ncase utterly : and I entirely confirm and support his\nstatement. One is no more hallucinated than when\nmaking observations in a laboratory. One must be on\none's guard against seeing things because we are told of\nthem, or would like to see them, but that is a common-\nplace of scientific training. In his Presidential Address\n\fIntroduction 9\nto the Society for Psychical Research the late Lord Rayleigh\nspeaks about his old experience, in and about the seventies\nof last century, as follows :\n\" I was not disinclined to believe that what was, or at\nany rate had recently been, orthodox opmiou might be\nquite wrong, and accordingly became mterested hi what I\nheard from friends of the domgs of Home and other\nso-called mediums. Some of the stories could, as it seemed,\nbe explained away only on the supposition of barefaced\nlying, or more charitably as the result of hallucination,\nwhether self-induced or due to the suggestion and influ-\nence of others. The possibility of the latter view cannot\nbe left out of account, but I have never seen anything to\nshow that it has the remotest application to niy own\nexperience or that of the friends with whom I have co-\noperated.\n\" The interest that I felt was greatly stimulated by the\nappearance of Sir W. Crookes's '\nNotes of an Enquiry into\nthe Phenomena called Spiritual during the years 1870-73.' ^\nI was acquainted with some of the author's scientific\nwork, and knew that he was a skilful experimenter and\nlikely to be alive to the precautions required in order to\nguard against sense illusions.\"\nAfter quoting a few phenomena testified to by Crookes\nin this article. Lord Rayleigh continues :\n\" The two mediums whose names are mentioned in the\narticle, and with whom most of the observations were\nmade, are Home and Miss Fox, afterwards Mrs. Jencken.\nA highly desirable characteristic of Home's mediumship\nwas the unusual opportunity allowed to the sense of sight.\nHome always objected to darkness at his seances. '\nIndeed,'\nsays Sir Wdham Crookes, '\nexcept on two occasions . . .\neverything that I have witnessed with him has taken\nplace in the hght.' [And Lord Rayleigh continues :\n\u2014\n]\n\" I found (and indeed still find) it difficult to accept what\none may call the '\nknave and fool theory '\nof these occur-\nrences ; but failing that, it would seem to follow that one\n^Quarterly Journal of Science, Jan. 1874.\n\f10 Sir Oliver Lodge.\nmust admit the possibility of much that contrasts strongly\nwith ordinary experience.\"\nHe then mentions experiments of his own with Mrs.\nJencken, Home not being available, and emphatically\nsays :\n\" In common, I suppose, with most witnesses of such\nthings, I repudiate altogether the idea of hallucination as\nan explanation.\"\nBut the whole address should be read, in the Pro-\nceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, Vol. XXX.,\npp. 275-290.\nPART II.\nSummary of the Phenomena.\nWhen, many years ago, Crookes lent me his copy of\nthe privately printed record now about to be published,\nhe said as he handed it to me, \" You will get most out\nof this book if you allow yourself, for the time, to imagine\nthat things happened as narrated.\" I doubt if I was able\nto follow his advice then ; for at that time my experience\nof supernormal phenomena was small, and my faith in\nscientific orthodoxy strong. First-hand experience has now\ndone what second-hand testimony could not : it has\ngradually shaken my beliefs out of their formal mould\nand enlarged my perceptions of the possibilities and\nrealities of existence.\nThe phenomena testified to in this book may be classi-\nfied roughly and incompletely as follows :\n(1) Movements of objects ivithout contact, that is without\nobvious and perceptible or normal contact. This is an\nextremely frequent occurrence with practically all physical\nmediums. Many observers, including myself, have testified\nto the fact that it truly happens. (See, for instance,\nJournal S.P.R. Vol. VI. pp. 354-357).\n(2) Luminosities and scents. These also are common\nphenomena, to the occurrence of which I can personally\ntestify. Sir William Crookes testified that he was not\n\fIntroduction 11\nimposed on by phosphorised oil or other chemical means,\nand that nevertheless, under the strictest test conditions,\n\" I have seen luminous pomts of light darting about\nand setthng on the heads of different persons ; I have\nhad questions answered by the flashing of a bright Mght\na desired number of times in front of my face. I have\nseen sparks of light rising from the table to the ceiling,\nand again falhng upon the table, strildng it with an\naudible soimd.\" {^Researches in Spiritualism,, p. 91.\nReprinted from The Quarterly Journal of Science.)\nSee also his summary of many other remarkable and\ntypical phenomena on pp. 88-96 of the same book.\n(3) Levitatian. The levitation of ordinary objects is only\na special case of movement of things without contact. I\nhave not myself seen the levitation of a human body ;\nbut it is no more difficult to understand than the raising\nof any other piece of matter.\nMost of the levitations of untouched objects that I\nhave seen have been in a dim light ; but with D. D.\nHome they are said to have occurred in daylight. And\nmy son, F. Brodie Lodge, whUe on a visit to Professor\nRichet at his Chateau de Carqueiranne, saw such a levita-\ntion in the presence of Eusapia Palladtno. The object\nraised was a heavy table, specially made for the purpose,\nwithout a flange, and with sharp pointed feet. The top\nof the table was continued vertically downwards for about\nsix inches, so that when hands were on the top, there\nwas nothing to grip on, and it could not be raised normally\nby a standing person. It weighed 48 lbs. (22 kilos), and\nwas purposely made awkward to catch hold of. This\ntable was at the time standing out of doors, in the full\nblaze of sunshine. And after it had gone up in the air,\nthey all stood away from it ; and to Ricliet's delight, it\nremained up. My son's testimony (from memory) is as\nfollows :\n\" It was only one incident among many at that time\n\u2014\nAugust or September 1898. I Avas eighteen, and next\nmonth started in business witli Alfred Booth & Co. in\nLiverpool ; so I am sure of the date.\n\f12 Sir Oliver Lodge\n\"At all the successful sittings with Eusapia that summer,\nobjects of various sizes were moved about, sometimes\nvisible, sometimes not, according to the illumination that\nEusapia allowed at the time. That day she must have\nfelt in particularly good form, because it was out in\nbroad daylight, with nothing overhead. But I was getting\npretty well used to the idea of table-lifting by then\n;\nonly I was struck by Professor Richet's joyous chuckle\nand triumphant challenge '\nEn pleine lumiere !\n'\n\" I used to keep a diary during those daj^s on the Mediter-\nranean. The incident occurred on the drive in front of the\nChateau de Carqueiranne, just to the left of it as you\nstand facing its front. We all started as usual round\nthe table\u2014the special heavy wooden one you Imow of,\nwith sharp pointed feet, which surely none of us alone\ncould lift, and which had been sj)ecially made for tests.\nWhen it was well up, about two feeb I should judge,\n(Eusapia being held as usual), Ave all, including Eusapia,\nstood back and away from it ; and Professor Richet\npassed his hand under it and over it and all round it.\nThen we did the same, some of us, and we were all\nquite satisfied that there was no physical support of any\nkmd.\"\n(4) The jdaying of an accordion, either unsupported or\nsupported at the keyless end (page 193). This was also\nobserved later with the same medium by Sir William\nCrookes and Sir William Huggins, when the accordion\nwas surrounded by a wire cage, so as to protect it from\ninterference (see Researches in Sjnritualistn, pp. 12 to\n14, with illustrations. Also pages 92 and 94). I have myself\nheard notes from an apparently untouched piano, and\nhave heard an accordion play under conditions reported\nin Journal S.P.R. Vol. VI. p. 350.\n(5) Withdrawal of scent from a flower (page 136). A\nrather similar effect was perhaps the one and only physical\nphenomenon achieved by Mrs. Piper, as testified to by\nDr. Hodgson. Mrs. Piper's fingers were moved near the\nflower, as if withdrawing something from it ; and in a\nfew hours it had withered.\n\fIntroduction 13\n(6) Pencil tvriting by itself. The phenomenon of \" direct\nwriting,\" that is with no normal contact with the pencil,\nis unusual ; but I have had experience of it under good\nconditions. It is, after all, only the intelligent movement\nof a piece of wood\u2014the intelligence having some lin-\nguistic acquirement, which is an additional feature. The\nintelligent and responsive movement of various objects\nabove a dining-table in full light has been forcibly attested\nby Crookes. (See Researches in Spiritualism, pages 90\nand 93).\n(7) Direct voices. These also I have heard with more\nthan one medium, and have verified then' genuine\ncharacter. On one occasion the tone of Raymond's voice\nwas recognised, though that is unusual. The incident\nwas subsequently referred to by him duruig a sitting\nwith another independent medium in an evidential manner.\n(See Raymond Revised, pp. 173, 174, 177.)\n(8) Elongation of the human body. This I have never\nseen, and am only acquainted with verbal testimony of\nSir William and Lady Crookes to the same phenomenon\nwith the same medium Home. Nor can I be sure that\nthere was anything beyond levitation.\n(9) The fire test. That is, the handling of red-hot\ncoals or the putting the face into the fire. This I have\nnot had experience of. But it is testified to by Crookes,\nHuggins, and several other people ;\nincluding Madame de\nCrespigny. I quote Crookes's evidence from Sir William\nBarrett's book On the Threshold of the Unseen, (page 75) :\n\" At Mr. Home's request, whilst he was entranced, I\nwent with him to the fireplace in the back drawing-room.\nHe [the influence controlling Home] said :\n'\nWe wane you\nto notice particularly what Dan [i.e. Home] is doing.'\nAccordingly I stood close to the fire, and stooped down\nto it when he put his hands in . . . Mr. Home then waved\na handkerchief about in the ah two or three times,\nheld it above his head, and then folded it up and laid\nit on his hand lilce a cushion. Putting his otlier hand\ninto the fire, he took out a large lump of cinder, red-\nhot at the loAver part, and placed the red part on the\n\f14 Sir Oliver Lodge\nhandkerchief. Under ordinary circumstances it would\nhave been in a blaze. In about half a minute he took\nit off the handkerchief with his hand, saying, '\nAs the\npower is not strong, if we leave the coal longer it will\nburn.' He then pub it on his hand, and brought it to\nthe table in the front room, where all but myself had\nremained seated.\"\nTo this Sir William Barrett adds :\n\" Not only have we Sir W. Crookes' evidence, but a\nformer President of the Royal Society, the late Su- W.\nHuggins, O.M., witnessed the same feat with Home and\ngave me a detailed account of it. So also did Mr. S. C.\nHall who was jDresent on another occasion, when a white\nhot coal was put on his head and his white hair gathered\nover it, but he told me he felt no heat and bis liair\nwas wholly uninjured.\n\" Various other eye witnesses have informed me that\nthey have seen Mr. Home handle with impunity red hot\ncoals ;\namong others a shrewd and able solicitor, the late\nMr. W. M. Wilkinson, writing to me from Lincoln's Inn\nFields, London, states that in the winter of 1869\n\u2014\n\" '\nI saw Mr. Home take out of our drawing-room fire\na red-hot coal, a little less in size than a cricket-ball,\nand carry it up and down the room. He said to Lord\nAdare,\u2014now Earl Dunraven,\u2014who was present. Will you\ntake it from me ? It will not hurt you. Lord Adare took\nit from him and held it in his hand for about half a\nmmute, and before he threw it back in the fire I put my\nhand close to it and felt the heat like that of a live\ncoal.'\n\"\nMadame de Crespigny's much more recent experience\nwas published in The Daily Exjjress (of date to me\nunknown). I asked Madame de Crespigny to send me a\nstatement ; and she says that it was in 1917.\n\"We met in an empty house in St. John's Wood,\nten or twelve of us, including a newspaper reporter from\nthe Daily Express. The medium was Mrs. Annie Hunter.\nA large fire was burning in the grate and the reporter\n\fIntroduction 15\nwent down into the cellar and brought up a log of wood.\nThis was put on the fire and turned round until it was\nred hot.\n\" The medium then went under cautrol il(e\u00a3, tontrol- was ,\nsaid to be a Persian fire-worshipper). .She\"'-]ifi>ed the^'fe^'\nhot log from the fire, after talking in an excited way in, a\nforeign language, and carried it about thsj. raora, putting,\nit back in the fire now and then to keep it at red heat.\nShe approached the reporter, who shrank away, and his\nhair was singed. She then offered ib to me. I argued\nthat as physical law told us flesh must burn if in contact\nwith a red hot log, and her flesh was not burning, another\nlaw must be superimposed. I had learnt of an '\noccult\n'\nlaw which was supposed to prevent contact, and con-\ncluded it must be in operation, and that if the log did\nnot burn her, it would not burn me. So I put my hand\nout without a qualm, and she laid the red hot log across\nit, leaving it there for some seconds. When she removed\nit, there was not a mark. I should not have cared how\nlong it remained. I knew it would not burn me.\n\" The man next me said that if conditions had been\nnorma] I should never have used my hand again.\n\" A man present, encouraged by what he had seen,\nallowed her to put the log near his head, without any\nbad results.\n\" I believe that had I had any fear, the vibrations\nwould have broken up the protective sheath.\nRose Ch. de Crespigny.\"\n(10) Objects remaining on a slanting table. This also is\ntestified to by others. (See page 63 of Barrett's On the\nThreshold of the Unseen, and also page xvi. of the\nBiographical Introduction to the Memorial Edition of\nStainton Moses' Spirit Teachhigs.)\nThe late W. Stainton Moses, a master at University\nCollege School, and one well known under his pen name\n\" M.A. Oxon,\" was not only a medium for automatic\nwriting and various intelligent communications about\nthings in general and for edifying teachings purporting to\ncome from the other side, but was also a physical medium\n\f16 Sir Oliver Lodge\nof no mean order. The phenomena testified to as fre-\nquently occurring in his presence are,\u2014raps, some of them\nof great intensity, lights and luminous vapours of various\nkmds, tli,e produetion of scents, of musical sounds, like\n'bells, -\nstiiiiged instj.'uments, and clarionets; also direct\n,\nwritmg without anyone touching the pencil ; movements\nand jevitatioiis : o| heavy objects ; the introduction of\nobjects from' other rooms into a closed and locked room\n\u2014a phenomenon which is frequently testified to, but which\nI have not myself securely observed ;\n\u2014the direct voice,\nthat is to say, a voice in the air at a distance from the\nmedium, when precautions are taken to prevent or to\nobserve separately the medium's own articulation ; and\nother very numerous phenomena.\nRemarks on the Attitude of Orthodox Science.\nThis brief summary, with these few illustrative examples,\nmust suffice to show that abnormal phenomena have been\ntestified to again and again, and that Lord Dunraven's\nexperiences with Home are only striking instances of\nthings which occur with less facility and less frequently\nthrough mediums of smaller power. In the years 1870,\n1871, a serious attempt was made by Crookes to examine\nsome of these things in a very simple form and in a\ncareful metrical manner, in the hope that they might be\no1:)served and testified to by the very distinguished chief\nOfficers of the Royal Society. In the attempt to interest\nthose representatives of science he did not succeed ; for\nthey objected that some of the phenomena were impossible\nin any mechanical or l^nown manner ;\n\u2014which of course\nwas Crookes's own contention, and exactly what he hoped\nwould arouse their interest sufficiently to cause them to\nutilise the exceptional opportunity of acquiring new\nknowledge by coming to witness what occurred. One\nof Crookes's simple arrangements for the hoped-for de-\nmonstration was a long registering lever, on the fulcrum\nof which the medium's hands were placed, with the result\nthat the far end was forcibly depressed. The deprecatory\nexcuse of an eminent man for not coming to see the\n\fIntroduction 17\nexperiment, was that it appeared to him contrary to all\nanalogy that a force acting according to physical laws\nshould produce the forcible depression of a lever by\nacting on its fulcrum. To which Crookes replied that he\nentirely agreed ; that was the whole gist of the experiment\nand the only reason he regarded it as worthy of attention.\nThe episode illustrates one of the difficulties which is\nbound to be encountered by investigators of novel physical\nphenomena. If a new kind of force is exerted, the ex-\nperiments are almost bound to be surprising and, so to\nspeak, incredible. We are now inclined to suppose that\nthe force in these cases is due to the mechanical inter-\nvention or employment of an invisible unknown material,\nprobably emanating from the medium, in the form of\nwhat we now call ectoplasm,\u2014a form of substance\nwhich was then not recognised by anyone. Nothing but\ndirect observation and instrumental confirmation can\nestablish such things as reahties. A theory need not\njump into existence at the same time as new facts are\nobserved ; but until there is some guiding theory or clue,\nthe facts seem detached from organised science, and are\nrebutted and disbelieved on theoretical grounds. Dis-\nbelief is only natural, and its foundation in common sense\nis rather like a modified version of David Hume's argu-\nment against miracles, viz. that it is more likely that a\nwitness should lie than that a miracle should happen ;\nbecause the one is consonant with human experience, and\nthe other is not. That is quite true ; but if the thing\nreally does happen, and if it can be shown contem-\nporaneously to happen, the argument has no force ; the\nfacts, when proven, are themselves an expansion of\nhuman experience ; and they clearly establish the need\nfor overhauling and enlarging our theoretical foundations.\nThings that are unlikely may nevertheless be true. Our\nknowledge of nature is not so extensive that we are able\nto say beforehand what is possible and what is not\npossible in a novel region of enquiry. The history of\nscience is too much disfigured by the premature rejection\nand contempt with which novelties have often been\nreceived. They are accepted, in the long run, by some\nB\n\f18 Sir Oliver Lodge\nsubsequent generation ; but the responsible generation\nliving at the time does not rise to the height of its\nopportunities. Contemporary men of science unfortunately\nwrite themselves down, as not only ignorant, which was\ninevitable, but as blind and prejudiced and sadly bigoted :\nthough it is true that in their lifetime their contemptuous\nattitude gains them credit for robust common sense\nand sanity. They are wise therefore in their day and\ngeneration.\nIt is singular, and perhaps depressing, that the obscurantist\nattitude of Theologians in the past has been so amply\nimitated by the pontiffs and high priests of science in\nthe recent present. They still oppose their admirable\ntheories and great knowledge of the universe to resist\nthe incursion of fresh information ;\nthey oppose observed\nfacts on a priori and utterly inadequate grounds. No one\nought to consider his knowledge of the universe so com-\nplete and final as to be competent to negative careful\ntestimony based on critical and responsible experiment\nand observation, especially if the observer has already\nproved his competence in more recognised branches of\nknowledge. Explanatory hypotheses may be criticised\nseverely, but the facts demand attention.\n' General Lines of a Hypothetical Explanation of Abnormal\nPhenomena.\nReturning to the more general aspect of the subject,\nI would point out that both on the physical and on the\npsychical side\u2014or in what Prof. Richet calls the objec-\ntive and the subjective variety of metapsychics,\u2014-the\nprincipal phenomena have a character which could be\nattributed to the action of unknown and hitherto un-\nsuspected Intelhgences, live things or live people. For they\nsimulate a life-like interference with the world of matter\nthrough the agency of a borrowed human organism ; some\nof the things done being such as we ourselves could do,\nand some being beyond those powers. This is undoubtedly\ntheir appearance, and I inchne to think that it is also\ntheir reality. I think that these phenomena are mainly\n\fIntroduction 19\nsurprising because we do not otherwise know of the\nagents who accomphsh them. If we did, they would\nbecome comparatively commonplace. Their value lies in\nthe demonstration of the existence of these, what we may\ncall, \" other people.\"\nThe fact is we have been living on an island planet,\napparently completely isolated, and not in touch with\nanything higher than ourselves. Religious people have\nalways supposed otherwise ; but scientific people, ex-\ncept in so far as they were also religious, have never\nhad occasion to postulate anything of the kind. Con-\nsequently they feel great repugnance to beginning. They\nwould prefer to exhaust aU known categories before\nintroducing any new ones ; and in this they are mani-\nfestly right. But the time will come\u2014has come already\nin my view\u2014when the known part of the Universe is\ninsufficient to account for the facts. Wo shall find our-\nselves like a race of Pacific islanders, who have known\nnothing about other people in the world, and who begin\nto be afflicted with indications of unaccustomed pheno-\nmena, coming at first from a distance,\u2014wireless waves,\nif any are sufficiently sensitive to feel that influence,\nshot and shell for those who are insensitive. Such islanders,\nif they were critical, would receive testimony to these\nsporadic occurrences with incredulity and general suspicion.\nAt length there comes a shipwrecked sailor, who may be\nseen by a few before he is rescued, but who is disbelieved\nin by most. Then others arrive, and inexpHcable pheno-\nmena begin to happen.\nThe parallel is not very close, because the visitants\nbelong to the same sphere of existence as the islanders.\nThe chief analogy is that the strange visitors are endowed\nwith what seem to be supernormal powers and extensive\nknowledge, which for the most part they are unable to\ncommunicate, or the islanders to receive. Even if one\nof the islanders were taken to a modern city, he would\nnot be able, on his return, to convey anything but the\nhaziest idea of the achievements of civilisation. While\nanother, who had been taken to visit some other city in\na different country, might give a rather differing account\n;\n\f20 Sir Oliver Lodge\nwherefore both would be disbelieved,\u2014differences being\nemphasised, and similarities overlooked.\nThe perception or realisation of other Intelligences in\nthe Universe than onr own, who are able under certain\nconditions to communicate with us, may or may not be\nwelcome or invigorating ; and yet it may be true. That\nis the only question for science.\nThe question of human siirvival, or persistent existence\n\u2014\nwhich appears to be demonstrated by several of the more\npsychic occurrences\u2014is of a higher order, and more\nmomentous to humanity. Psycho-physical phenomena\nappear to be of a lower grade, and seem to be a con-\ntribution from fairly low-scale intelligences, who by long\npractice have learnt how to manipulate matter by inter-\nfering with accessible nerve-muscle mechanism and other\norganised material. It is customary to attribute these\nodd powers to the activity of the sub-conscious ; that is\nto a submerged modification or variety of ordinary human\nintelligence such as may be evoked by hypnotism ; and\nthis view, that the intelligence concerned is an emanation\nfrom the subconsciousness of the medium, though surely\ninadequate as an explanation of all that occiirs, is de-\nserving of respect. Yet these phenomena, in spite of\ntheir presumably low grade, are not so entirely dis-\nsociated from discarnate human activity that they can be\nignored or disregarded, even by those who would prefer\nto limit their enquiries to the purely mental or sub-\njective side ; nor can they reasonably be contemned.\nWe are not in a position to contemn any fact in the\nUniverse. We never know what the bearing may be of\nany scientific discovery, nor what applications it may\nhave. Our sole business as scientific men is to explore\nand ascertain the truth. If the truth, when ascertained,\nseems to us and to posterity to be commonplace and\nunimportant, that will be rather an unprecedented occur-\nrence. Anyhow it would be one for which we are in no\nway responsible. Important or unimportant, welcome or\nunwelcome, we are bound to be loyal to what we con-\nceive to be truth, be the consequences what they may.\nMarch 11, 1924. OLIVER LODGE.\n\fAUTHOR'S PREFACE.\nThe occurrences that are recorded in the following pages\ntook place some sixty years ago. During that period a\ngreat deal of attention has been paid to psychical matters\nin general ; and spirituahsm in particular has been criti-\ncally investigated by the Society for Psychical Research\nand by other Associations. Many men eminent in the\nsphere of science have studied the subject. A vast number\nof facts must have been accumulated, investigated, sifted\nand tabulated ; and phenomena observed and recorded\nmore than half a century ago are presumably out of date.\nWhether they are, or are not, I am not in a position to\njudge, as I have not kept in touch with the subject\nsince those distant days ; but I am told by those who\nhave, and who ought to know, that the experiences of\nmy father and myself are in some respects unique ; and\nthat, in the search after truth, they ought to be made\navailable to those who desire to study them.\nI came across Mr. D. D. Home long ago in Paris, I\nforget under what circumstances, but they had nothing\nto do with spiritualism or with his mediumship. My\nmeetmg him again in 1867 was fortuitous. Circumstances\nin the shape of rheumatism, or rheumatic gout, led me\nto Dr. Gully's hydropathic establishment at Malvern and\nthere I became acquainted with Mr. Home, who was\nstaying with Dr. Gully as a guest. I was attracted by\nsome phenomena which took place immediately. I liked\n]Mr. Home. He had the defects of an emotional character,\nwith vanity highly developed (perhaps wisely to enable\nhim to hold his own against the ridicule and obloquy\nthat was then poured out vipon spiritualism and every\none connected with it). He was Uable to fits of great\n21\n\f22 Preface\ndepression and to nervous crises difficult at first to\nunderstand ; but lie was withal of a simple, kindly,\nhumorous, lovable disposition that appealed to me. I\nstruck up an intimate friendship with him, and spent\na great deal of time during the next two years in his\ncompany, with the result that the phenomena, wliich\nare here recorded, occurred at all times and seasons,\nunder all sorts of conditions\u2014in broad daylight, in artificial\nlight, in semi-darkness, at regular seances, unpremeditatedly\nwithout any seance a.t all, indoors, out of doors, in private\nhouses, in hotels\u2014at home and abroad, and it is probable\nthat to that extent these experiences are pecuHar. They\nwere printed by my father in order to preserve them, but\nfor rigidly private circulation which was obviously neces-\nsary at the time. Nearly all the jjersons mentioned have\n\" joined the great majority.\" Those remainmg with us\nwith whom I have been able to communicate have no\nobjection to publication ; neither have I, though the\nrecords allude to matters very persona] to myself. And\nas, in the opinion of those who have studied the subject,\npublication would be in the interests of science, I have\nagreed to it.\nI came to certain conclusions at the time, but I do not\naUude to them here, preferring to leave readers to form\ntheir own conclusions on facts placed before them without\ncomment. But some little explanation is necessary on\none or two points. I can, of course, speak only of the\nperiod during which I was closely connected with Mr.\nHome, but it is perhaps right to say that during that\ntime he never took money for seances, and seances failed\nas often as not. He was proud of his gift, but not\nhappy in it. He could not control it and it placed him\nsometimes in very unpleasant positions. I think he would\nhave been pleased to have been reheved of it, but I\nbeheve he was subject to these manifestations as long as\nhe Hved. It may be asked why did I abandon research\nafter an experience which, it will be admitted, was at\nleast interesting ; and it may be assumed that something\nin Home's character or in the manifestations themselves\nmust have repelled me. That assumption would be quite\n\fPreface 23\nerroneous. My belief in the genuineness of the phenomena\nremained unshaken, and my friendship with Mr. Home\ndid not diminish or change. The simple reason is that\nhaving satisfied myself that the facts were not due to\ntrickery or fraud, I found that I made little progress\nafter a certain point. Phenomena were all of the same\ncharacter, mainly physical, designed apparently to prove\nthat some force or forces other than physical, as we\nunderstand it, could be made to operate upon inanimate\nobjects. I had no inclination to investigate the nature\nof these forces. Study of the occult was not congenial\nto me. I was only twenty-four and I had my ambitions\nand plans for my life. I loved sport and an active\n\" out-of-doors \" life. All my instincts were to deal with\nthe physical world and the material aspects of life, and\nI did not feel myself competent to deal with anything\nelse. I thought that in some cases absorption in the\nsubject tended to weaken the sense of self-dependence and\nof the necessity of submitting everything to reason\n;\nand I found that seances for physical manifestations were\nphysically very exhausting to me. So having had my\nexperience I came to the conclusion that I was neither\nby inclination or natural character designed to spend my\ntime in pursuing the subject, and I completely abandoned it.\nMuch of the narrative in the following pages appears\ninconsequential and confused. It is not really so. Many\nof the communications, comments, and remarks were of\ntoo intimately private a character to be stated in full\nat the time ; but the allusions were perfectly understood\nby those concerned.\nIt will be noted that on one or two occasions state-\nments of a prophetic character were made, and opinions\nare expressed, or are alleged to be expressed, by a spidt\non physical science which, I take it, are entkely erroneous.\nOn that I have nothing to say except that the narrative\nstates that the communication was very confused. But\nin fau'ness I must comment upon seance 6, described on\npp. 62-63. That seance was obviously held on the\neve of my departure to join the Abyssinian Expedition. It\nis stated that the spirit of an Abyssinian chief was chosen\n\f24 Preface\nto look after me ; that lie would save my life on two\noccasions, and that though I could not then remember\nhis name I would later hear and recognise it. It is, of\ncourse, impossible for ai\\y one to say that under such\ncircumstances, or, indeed, under any circumstances, his\nlife was not in imminent danger ; but it is right I should\nstate that, so far as I was and am aware, my life was\nnot on two occasions, or on one occasion, in special\ndanger ; and that though I was much interested in the\nAbyssinian tribes\u2014then- manners, customs, and history,\nand talked with many chiefs, I never recognised the name\nmentioned at the seance.\nI regret that the seances and occurrences were not\nmore methodically arranged and that headings may be\nerroneous\u2014as, for instance, ui the case of Seance No. 41,\nand that details concerning the localities in which seances\nwere held, and the circumstances attending them, were\nnot more specifically stated ; but it must be remembered\nthat my records were embodied in private letters to my\nfather written at a time when no publication of any\nkmd was contemplated ; and that the book was com-\npiled and printed for strictly private circulation among\nthose who knew all about the circumstances mentioned.\nThe name of the narrator is not always mentioned.\nIt may be taken for granted that the letters or notes\nwere written by me, except in those cases to which my\nfather's name is appended. One or two accounts are\nmentioned of occurrences of which I was not personally\ncognisant. Obviously they were included because they\nwere explanatory of, or referred to, occurrences at which\nI was present.\nIt is also to be noted that when Mr. Home spoke in\nthe trance state he aUuded to himself as \" Daniel \" or\n\" Dan,\" and in aUudmg to others always used the first\nname except in respect of my father and myself. He\nmentioned us as \" Dunraven \" and \" Adare.\" It will be\nremembered that in those days I was \" Adare,\" and my\nfather \" Dunraven.\"\nIt is desirable that the supernormal phenomena herein\nmentioned should be co-orduiated and compared with\n\fPreface 25\nphenomena of a similar character which have been recorded\nduring the last half century and more. They should be\nviewed in the light of knowledge acquired since they were\nprinted. The experience requires supplementing in that\ndirection, and Sir OUver Lodge and others have been so\ngood as to undertake that work. But this publication\nis not based on recollection of events that took place\nmany years ago. Its sole merit consists of the fact that\nthe phenomena were noted and recorded at the time,\nand the original text has not been altered in any way.\nI was very yoimg at the time. I was devoted to out-\ndoor sport and was not trained in scientific observation.\nAll that I desire to say is that, to the best of my ability,\nI scrupulously examined certain strange phenomena, which\ncame under my observation, and faithfully recorded the\nfacts. My father's case was very different. The whole\nbent of his mind was towards science. He was trained\nin science and was an acute observer. He was a devout\nRoman Catholic and a very Hberal minded man. His\nremarks are valuable and his preface is retained. My\nUttle preface, written at the time, is without value, and I\nhave omitted it.\nDUNRAVEN.\n\fIt may be of interest to reproduce the Introduction ivhich my\nfather wrote in 1870 to the volume printed for private\ncirculation.\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS\nBy the late Earl of Duneaven\nThe subject of Spiritualism was first brought under my\nnotice about fifteen years ago, by reading two or three\naccounts of the occurrences which were taking place in\nAmerica. To some extent I was prepared for the fair\nconsideration of very strange and startling phenomena,\nfrom having previously examined fully into the subject of\nmesmerism. The result of this enquiry, carried on for\nseveral months, under most favourable circumstances, was\na thorough conviction of the reality of the phenomena of\nmesmerism, from the simple sleep up to clairvoyance. At\nthat time, scientific men in general, and the medical pro-\nfession in particular, were loud in condemnation of what\nthey considered sheer imposture ; and one of the most\neminent of the profession, the late Dr. Elliotson, lost a\nconsiderable portion of his very extensive practice by his\nbold and uncompromising assertion of the truth of mes-\nmerism and its great importance as a curative agent.\nSince then a great change has taken place in the opinion\nof the public on this subject. Judging by the literature of\nthe day, as well as by the remarks current in society, the\ngeneral phenomena of mesmerism are widely accepted as\ntrue ; and even those who believe in the higher pheno-\nmena, including clairvoyance, are no longer necessarily\nconsidered to be the victims of imposture.\n\fIntroductory Remarks 27\nWhen table turning became one of the amusements of\nthe day, I witnessed and tried various experiments which\nclearly demonstrated the inadequacy of Professor Faraday's\nexplanation of the manifestations by involuntary muscular\naction. I was also present at a seance, where Mrs. Hayden\nwas the medium, and an attentive examination of what\ntook place sufficed to satisfy me that the subject was\nworthy of careful examination, to be made whenever an\nopportunity should occur for a full investigation into a\nclass of phenomena, opening a new field of research of a\nvery strange and startling description. This opportunity\nhas been afforded by Lord Adare's acquaintance with Mr.\nHome, which commenced in 1867. I soon perceived from\nhis letters, that the manifestations were so remarkable\nthat they deserved to be duly chronicled and preserved.\nAt my request he has carefully noted, as fully as could\nconveniently be done, the occurrences of each day, and\nhas permitted me to print the whole series for private\ncirculation. Publication is out of the question, as much\nthat is interesting and a valuable portion of the record,\nrelates to private domestic affairs, and to near relatives or\nintimate friends.\nEven after the unavoidable suppression of some curious\nand instructive details, it was not without much reluctance\nthat we made up our minds to give even a very limited\ncirculation to this series of seances ;\nbut, after full con-\nsideration we have deemed it best to print\u2014as nearly as\nwe possibly could venture to do\u2014the entire record ;\nnot-\nwithstanding the pain, to ourselves and others, which\nnecessarily accompanies the mention of communications\nprofessing to come from those whose memories caU up the\ndeepest and tenderest feelings of our nature. It is obvious\nthat the chief value of such a record must depend upon\nthe trustworthiness of the narrator. Fidelity of description\nis very rare, even where honesty of purpose is undoubted.\nI believe that in the present case scrupulous accuracy, a\nretentive ^memory, and an unexcitable temperament are\ncombined in an unusual degree, forming just such a com-\nbination of quaUties as is indispensable for one who under-\ntakes to record phenomena of this exceptional and startling\n\f28 Introductory Remarks\ncharacter. In several of the latter seances, portions of\nthem have been written by both Lord Adare and myself,\nand then carefully compared ; some were looked over by\nmore than one of the persons present : thus everything\nhas been done to ensure the greatest accuracy. In\naddition, each of those mentioned as present at the\nseances (except a few who are not within reach) has\nreceived a copy of the printed account, and replies have\nbeen received from all, affirming the accuracy of the\nreports. A list of these names will be given further on,\nand thus the following pages, it is hoped, will be found\nto contain the fullest and best authenticated account of\nthe phenomena of Spiritualism which has as yet appeared\nin this country.\nIt must be borne in mind that an actual record of facts,\nand not the adoption or refutation of any particular\ntheory, is the main object in view. Spiritualism wiU,\ntherefore, in the ensuing remarks, be regarded chiefly in\nits scientific or phenomenal aspect, and I have purposely\navoided expressing any decided opinion on questions so\ncomplicated, and about which at present such conflicting\nopinions prevail, as upon the character of the phenomena,\nthe source from which they proceed, and the tendency of\nthe teaching to be derived from them.\nThe whole subject of Spiritualism is one which must\nsoon command the attention of thoughtful men in this\ncountry, as it has very fully done in America, and to\nsome extent in France and other countries of Europe. In\nAmerica, the belief in Spiritualism may be considered as a\nfait acco7npli. Its adherents are said to be reckoned by\nmillions ;\nvarying from three to eleven, according to\ndifferent accounts ;\nbut, even should the lowest calculation\nbe beyond the exact truth, as is probably the case, there\ncan be no doubt that a considerable portion of the people\nof the United States, including many men eminent in\nscience, literature, politics, &c. (among whom was to be\nreckoned the late President Lincoln), believe that a means\nof communication is now open between the inhabitants of\nthis world and intelligent beings belonging to a different\nstate of existence ; thus affording a new and astounding\n\fIntroductory Remarks 29\nevidence for the reality of another life, and of a spirit-\nworld. It is remarkable that this new source of evidence\nshould be discovered at a time when materialism, and the\ndenial of a future state are on the increase, apparently in\nall parts of the world, and are said to prevail to an\nalarming extent in America, the country, be it remarked,\nwhere first these manifestations occurred on a large or\nstriking scale. The timidity or apathy of men of science\nin England on this subject is to be deplored. A remark-\nable example of the former was seen in the case of the\nlate Sir David Brewster. He was present at two seances\nof Mr. Home's, where he stated, as is affirmed on the\nwritten testimony of persons present, his impression that\nthe phenomena were most striking and startling, and he\ndoes not apjjear then to have expressed any doubt of their\ngenuineness, but he afterwards did so in an offensive\nmanner. The whole discussion may be read in Mr. Home's\nbook entitled, \" Incidents in my Life.\" I mention this\ncircumstance, because, I was so struck with what Sir\nDavid Brewster\u2014with whom I was well acquainted\u2014had\nhimself told me, that it materially influenced me in deter-\nmining to examine thoroughly into the reality of the\nphenomena. I met him one day on the steps of the\nAthenaeum ; we got upon the subject of table-turning,\n&c. ; he spoke most earnestly, stating that the impression\nleft on his mind from what he had seen, was, that the\nmanifestations were to him quite inexplicable by fraud, or\nby any physical laws with which we were acquainted, and\nthat they ought to be fully and carefully examined into.\nAt present I know of only three eminent men of science\nin England, who have gone fully into the subject ; and\nin their case the enquiry has resulted in a conviction\nof the genuineness of the phenomena. I allude to Mr.\nDe Morgan the mathematician, Mr. Varley the electrician,\nand Mr. Wallace the naturalist, all, as is well known,\nmen of high distinction in widely difl'ering departments of\nscience.\nIn investigating this subject, the greatest patience is\nrequired. As in the somewhat analogous case of clair-\nvoyance, the recurrence of similar phenomena is most\n\f30 Introductory Remarks\nuncertain, owing partly to the varying physical conditions\nof the medium, partly to the physical state of one or\nmore of those present, or even to the state of the atmo-\nsphere ;\npartial or even total failures must, therefore,\noccasionally be expected. I remember at a seance held to\nwitness the clairvoyant phenomena of Alexis, how the\neffect of the presence of one lady sufficed nearly to\nobliterate his power ;\nshe, fortunately for us, left the room\nin disgust at what she designated as humbug, as Alexis's\npower returned almost immediately after her departure,\nand we had a most interesting and beautiful seance. A\nvery analogous example in the case of Spiritualism will\nbe found at p. 192 of the following seances. Great caution\nmust, therefore, be observed, and great allowances made\nwherever a hond fide desire to arrive at truth is the real\nobject of the enquirer.\nTaking a general view of the subject, there are five\nhypotheses, three of them widely accepted, for explaining\nthe so-caUed spiritualistic phenomena. The first, adopted\nby the world at large, maintains that they are the result\nof tricks or clever contrivance ; in other words, that the\nmediums are impostors, and the whole exhibition humbug.\nAccording to the second, which is advocated by some\nscientific and medical men, the persons assisting at a\nseance become, then and there, the victims of a sort of\nmania or delusion, and imagine phenomena to occur, which\nhave no real objective existence. The third maintains that\nthe manifestations are referable to cerebral action, con-\nscious or unconscious. This theory is evidently incapable\nof embracing the whole of the phenomena, and is not very\nwidely advocated. The fourth, adopted almost unani-\nmously by Spiritualists, is that the manifestations are\ncaused by the agency of the spirits of departed human\nbeings ;\nand, generally speaking, by those who profess to\nbe present. According to the fifth, which is held chiefly\nby believers in dogmatic Christianity, and also by many of\nthe Low Church and Calvinistic school, the phenomena are\nsupposed to be duo to the agency of evil spirits or devils,\npersonifying departed human beings, who have obtained\nthis new power apparently for the purpose of undermining\n\fIntrod^lCtory Remarks 31\nthat conception of Christianity which has hitherto been\nahnost universally received.\nNo amount of written or oral testimony seems to be\nsufficient to carry conviction on this mysterious subject to\nthe minds of the vast majority of persons ;\nyet a candid\nenquirer, reading a record such as that contained in the\nfollowing pages, embracing so great a variety of pheno-\nmena, witnessed under varying circumstances and con-\nditions, and attested by so many persons, can hardly\navoid, without putting aside the narrator's testimony as\nutterly tmtrustworthy, admitting the possibility that some\nof the occurrences here recounted are the work of an\nagency beyond that of the persons present. The examples\nare so numerous that it would be difficult to make a\nselection for illustration ; but the reader's attention may\nbe caUed to those instances where Mr. Home had never\nbefore entered the room in which the seance was held ; as\nfor example, at No. 5, Buckingham Gate, mentioned in\np. 57 ; or where, as in Seance No. 1, and indeed many of\nthe others, he had no possible opportunity of making any\npreparatory arrangements. It is perhaps as well here to\nmention, that we have not, on a single occasion, during\nthe whole series of seances, seen any indication of con-\ntrivance on the part of the medium for producing or\nfacilitating the manifestations which have taken place.\nThe larger has been our experience, and the more varied\nthe phenomena, the more firmly have we been convinced\nthat a large portion of them are but explicable on the\nhypothesis that they are caused by intelligent beings,\nother than the persons in the room ; the remainder being\nprobably due to the action of physical laws as yet un-\nknown.\nThe phenomena may be divided into two classes :\nPhysical manifestations ; and communications or messages.\nThe former are divisible again into those which are solely\nor partly due to physical forces acting by a law\u2014not yet\nascertained\u2014and those which imply a power exercised by\nan invisible and intelligent agent. To the first division of\nthe physical manifestations, certain movements and vibra-\ntions of the table, or other articles of furniture may be\n\f32 Introductory Remarks\nreferred ; and perhaps the cold currents of air so often\nfelt at the commencement of seances. As an example of\nthe second may be mentioned the case of the table rising\nabove our heads, described in page 218 ; but a more\ndecided illustration is afforded at page 227, where a table\nwas raised (no one touching it) and placed most carefully\nupon another table ; also may be cited those occasions on\nwhich the accordion was played, when not held or touched\nby mortal hands. One very curious example of vibration\nof the table will be found at the end of Seance No. 51,\np. 179, where the manifestation can only be referred to an\nintelligent agent, or to fraud on the part of some one\npresent. I was so struck by the synchronism of the\nvibration with each stroke of the clock, as indicating an\nintelligence at work somewhere, that I examined closely\nbut failed to detect any indication that it was caused by\nany one of those sitting at the table.\nThe communications may be divided into six classes ;\nthose which come through the alphabet ;\nthrough the\nplanchette ;\nwriting by the influenced hand ; direct spirit-\nwriting ; audible spirit-voices ;\nand, lastly, by the medium\nin a trance. The first and last methods are those em-\nployed in the following seances. Those delivered by the\nmedium in a trance are obviously unsuited to convince\npersons of the existence of spirits ;\ngenerally they afford\nno actual proof of the utterances being other than the\nthoughts of the medium ; there are, however, exceptional\ncases, as where a communication is made to some person\npresent, detailing circumstances unknown to the others, and\nof which the medium is almost certainly ignorant. Gener-\nally, but not always, these examples may be referable to\nthe powers of mind-reading, similar to that manifested by\nclairvoyants. A genuine message, spelled out by the\nalphabet, is best suited to produce conviction that a\ncommunication is really from a spirit, especially where the\nraps, indicative of the letters which compose the words,\nare made at a distance from the medium, or are of such\na nature as to have rendered it impossible for him to have\ncaused them. The most striking cases are those where the\nmode of marking the letters is unknown to the medium or\n\fIntroductory BemarJcs 33\nto any one present, except the person addressed. Examples\nwill be found at pp. 193, 194, and 206, where the letters\nwere indicated by my being touched on the knee. Not\nonly are the two modes of communication of very different\nvalue as to their power of producing conviction in the\nreality of the phenomena, but likewise as to the reliability\nof the messages sent ; and this must be carefully borne in\nmind when judging of the tendency of the communications,\nor teaching derived from them. When Mr. Home speaks\nin a trance, there is no certainty whether his utterances\nare those of a spirit alone, or how far they may be mixed\nup with his own ideas or principles. Sometimes the com-\nmunications are striking, at other times vague, sometimes\ntrivial. Messages through the alphabet, on the other hand,\ncarry at least a strong probability that they convey the\nthoughts of a spirit ;\nalthough even they too in some\ncases exhibit indications of being affected by the medium,\nand are therefore not quite reliable.\nThe foregoing remarks will suffice to shew that in my\nopinion the first of the five hypotheses is utterly unten-\nable. The second is disposed of by such cases as are\ndetailed in pp. 227, 232. In the first example, the table,\nlifted up and placed upon that at which we were sitting,\nremained in the same position after the seance was broken\nup. In the second, the traces of the snuff which had\nbeen poured out on the shelf under the window were\nvisible after supper. The third hypothesis requires no\nparticular comment, being held by a very limited number\namong those who believe in the reality of the phenomena.\nOnly two, therefore, need occupy the reader's attention,\nnamely, that by which the manifestations are supposed to\nbe caused by deceased human beings, or that which\naffirms them to be entirely due to the agency of lying\nspirits or devils. It is worthy of notice how the majority\nof the communications can be pressed into the service of\neither hypothesis.\nThe probabihty of the latter of the two theories being\nthe correct one, extravagant and repulsive as this must\nappear to so many in the present day, results from the\ndifficulty of reconciling the announcements of Spiritualism\nc\n\f34 Introductory Bemarks\nwith the belief in certain doctrines hitherto uniformly\nmaintained by all portions of Christendom. The necessity\nof a sacrificial atonement through Christ to obtain our\nsalvation ; the sejoaration of mankind at death into two\nclasses, the saved and the lost ; the former destined to'\nlive for ever in union with God and in happiness, the\nlatter in perpetual separation from Him, in punishment\nand misery ; and the existence of a personal devil, and of\nfallen angels, whose unceasing efforts are directed to pro-\ncure the loss of men's souls, are beliefs or doctrines which\nhave been universally held by aU churches. Now, the\nfirst and most important of these doctrines, one which has\nbeen regarded almost as the basis of Christianity, is\nseldom if ever alluded to in the following seances, while\nthe two others are absolutely denied by Spiritualists in aU\ncountries. Thus, too, the miracles of the Old and New\nTestament are referred to natural laws, as exemplified,\np. 144, in the passage of the Israelites through the Red\nSea ; and in p. 157, where the phenomena which occurred\non the day of Pentecost are imitated. More might be\ncited having the same tendency, as for example the views\nput forward in p. 119 ;\nbut, as has been already stated,\nthe principal object here is to place on record a series of\nactual occurrences and communications, and then to\nindicate very slightly such points as are most worthy of\nthe attention of an enquirer into their bearing upon the\nprevailing opinions of the day, on questions of social and\nreligious importance. It should, however, be borne in\nmind that the majority of the statements here alluded to\nwere made by the medium in a trance, and cannot be\nregarded as so probably the sayings of spirits, as if they\nwere derived from messages through the alphabet. I must\nalso observe that I have read many communications\nreceived through writing and drawing mediums which are\ndistinctly Christian in their teaching, they are full of refer-\nence to our Lord and to his office as the Mediator of\nmankind ; but all, as far as my knowledge extends, have\na latitudinarian character about them. Most fearfiil pic-\ntures are drawn of the consequences of sin, and of the\nway retribution must be made for evil done in this world.\n\fIntroductory Remarks 35\nMany Spiritualists affirm that communications coming from\nthese sources are of a higher kind than those conveyed through\nthe ordinary physical means, such as raps, table tiltings, &c.\nIn other important particulars there is an apparent con-\ntrast between Christianity and the tendency of SpirituaHsm.\nIn the New Testament, submission to authority and child-\nlike obedience are inculcated as qualities pecuUarly apper-\ntaining to the Christian believer, whereas the teaching of\nthe spirits, as here recorded, seems rather to bring every-\nthing to the test of our reason. The spirit of Christianity\nhas generally been antagonistic to the spirit of the world,\nand frequently to what may be called the spirit of the\nage. Latitudinarianism ;\nopposition to ecclesiastical rule\nand authority ;\nand dislike of forms as well as dogmas,\nare characteristic of the present day ; and these principles\nare in accordance with the general teaching of Spirituahsm,\nwhich is decidedly latitudinarian, and in harmony with the\nspirit of anti-sacerdotahsm as opposed to that of dogmatic\nChristianity.\nThe reader of the following pages will not fail to per-\nceive that a high and pure morality is taught in them ;\nthat the love of God, the value of prayer, and the im-\nportance of cultivating a truthful spirit are strongly incul-\ncated ;\nthe terrible effects of sin, and the necessity of\nleading a good life in this, in order to occupy a high\nplace in the next world, are forcibly pointed out. But\nwhat must perplex an orthodox Christian reader of these\nseances is the startling fact, that all reference to our\nLord's office and work, as the sole passport to heaven, is\npractically omitted, and that He, whom all Catholics and\nmost Protestants recognize as the sun of their rehgion,\nand the centre of their worship, seems to form so small a\npart of the thoughts or teaching of the spirits that here\nspeak to us from beyond the grave.\nThat every variety of religious opinion, and all forms of\nChristianity are taught by spirits, is fuUy shown in an\nexcellent book on Spirituahsm, designated by rather an\nill-chosen title, \" Planchette ;\nor, the Despair of Science.\" i\n1 Planchelle ; or Uie De.paa of Science. [By Epes Sargent.] Boston\n1869. 6 J\n\f36 Introductory Remarks\nThis, however, is quite in accordance with the general\nbelief of Spiritualists, namely, that spirits hold various\nviews because they retain in the next world their complete\nindividuality, and to a certain extent their ignorance ;\nthey do not therefore know for certain that one system is\nbetter than another. They teach immortality ; a living\nProvidence ; the possibility of communicating with us ;\nthat God has condemned no one to an eternity of punish-\nment ;\nand they usually imply that a good life in itself,\nrather than as springing from our union with Christ's\nmerits, is the passport to a happy position in the next\nworld. If what Spiritualists affirm be true, that the\nspirits are really those of departed human beings, and not\ndemons, no harm can be done by narrowly scanning the\ntendency of some of their announcements in an opposite\ndirection ;\nand on the contrary, if they are demons or\ndevils, the importance cannot be overrated of warning\nthose who are interested in the subject, lest they find\nthemselves implicated in the adoption of a system, which\nmust on that hypothesis be looked upon as a very formid-\nable conspiracy against the Christian religion, as hitherto\nbelieved in all countries.\nIt must, however, be evident to a thoughtful peruser of\nthese pages, (and still more should he extend his reading\nto larger works on Spiritualism ;\nsuch, for example, as the\n\" Life of the Seeress of Prevorst,\") that the evil-spirit or\ndevil hypothesis is surrounded by such formidable diffi-\nculties, that hasty judgments and rash conclusions cannot\nbe too strongly deprecated. Not to go so far back as the\nopposition made to Galileo and others, when their dis-\ncoveries appeared to militate against the letter of Scrip-\nture ; how many of us remember the sensation caused,\nand the alarms expressed by pious and learned persons,\nwhen the discoveries in geology demonstrated the impos-\nsibility of the world being created in six days, a few\nthousand years ago, but that it has existed and been\npeopled with animals for millions of years. Again, the\nuniversality of the Flood, so clearly declared in the words\nof Scripture, is fouud to be incompatible with the results\nof careful observation of the actual state of the surface of\n\fIntroductory EemarJcs 37\nthe earth. Among the beHefs exploded by geological\nresearch, may be mentioned the doctrine that pain and\ndeath, not only in man but in animals, are the result of\nAdam's sin. The fact being that the remains of animals,\nfitted to prey upon and kiU each other, are found in strata\nformed millions of years ago, and in many cases the\nsmaller creatures which were devoured are found within\nthe stomachs of those by whom they were killed and\neaten. Later still, the short amount of time during which\nman has existed on the globe, as deduced from even the\nlongest Scripture chronology, is irreconcilable with recent\nresearches in geology, in archaeology, and in philology ; the\naccuracy of which is every year more and more confirmed\nby additional observations, clearly indicating that man has\ninhabited this world for a period, not to be reckoned by\nthousands but by tens of thousands of years. This subject\nmight be pursued much further, and additional illustrations\ngiven, tending to inculcate the necessity of modifying pre-\nconceived opinions on questions of great importance. To\nmention only one\u2014that of miracles ; \u2014certain phenomena\nwhich have been universally considered as miraculous, or,\nto use the current expression, supernatural, are identical\nwith those which are manifested by clairvoyants. How far\nthis may extend cannot at present be known, but sufficient\nis established to render it advisable to pause before\ndenouncing those who deny that certain phenomena are\nmiraculous ; some of which are, and others may be,\nreferable to physical laws that have only recently been\nincluded within the domain of natural science, and which\nare as yet only partially understood. I would also point\nto the wonderful healing powers of certain mediums, as\naffording a subject of most serious consideration and re-\nflection, but which need not be entered upon here as not\nbearing upon the following seances.\nArguing by analogy, it need not surprise us to find, as\nmust be the case should the announcements of Spiritualism\nbe true, that the conceptions hitherto held by Christians\nof all denominations, of the state of existence in the next\nworld, may require considerable modification. We are in-\nformed that the spirit-world is very analogous in some\n\f38 Introductory Remarks\nresj)ects to this ; that it is one of continued progression ;\nthat we are not suddenly brought to the full knowledge of\nreligious truth ; that the belief we hold here we shall in\nall probability, at least for a time, retain there, in pro-\nportion as we are more bigoted in this life, and con-\nsequently more difficult to teach in the next. We are told,\np. 95, \" There is a contest \" going on, \" same as on earth \"\n;\nbut, \" pnrity when freed from the mortal is strongest, as\ntruth overcomes error.'' At different epochs of the world,\nthe same subject is regarded from very different points of\nview. For example, the idea of the punishment of hell\nbeing a material fire was for many ages almost universal ;\nit certainly is not so at present, even among the most\northodox believers in the doctrine of eternal punishment.\nA difficulty of another kind, one not easily got over,\nstands in the way of the adoption of the evil-spirit theory,\nnamely the fact that conversions have been made by the\nagency of Spiritualism, from Atheism and from simple\nDeism to Christianity. To take one instance ; Dr. Elliot-\nson was a strong materialist, and unbeliever ; he was\nconverted, through Mr. Home's manifestations, to Chris-\ntianity. In accordance with this fact we have a message\nfrom a spirit purporting to be his, (vide seance No. 10)\n\" \/ now hnoio that my Redeemer liveth,\" &c. Again others,\namong whom are four or five of my own acquaintance,\nhave been led by the same means from Unitarianism to a\nbelief in the divinity of Christ. Still more striking are the\ncases where persons have been brought into the Church of\nRome, several examples of which have occurred in America\nand a few in England. The case of Dr. and Airs. Nichols\n(Americans) affords a most remarkable instance in point\n;\nand it would be strange could any of these individuals be\nbrought to believe that their advance from a lower to a\nhigher religious creed was due to the agency of the devil\n;\nnor can the express testimony be overlooked of some pure-\nminded, earnest persons, as to the elevating effect of the\nbelief in Spiritualism upon their hearts and souls. Take\nfor example the interesting and striking account of the\nclosing years and death of a very beautiful character, the\nlate Mrs. Home, as described by Mrs. Howitt and Mrs.\n\fIntroductory Remarks 39\nS. C. Hall\/ where the happiness and the blessings which\nSpiritualism has produced, not only in her case, but in\ntheir own, are portrayed in a tone strikingly earnest and\nyet quite free from anything like excitement or exaggera-\ntion. To ascribe such peace and joy in believing, such\nlove of our Lord, and resignation to His will as led the\nBishop of Perigueux\u2014who administered the last sacraments\nto Mrs. Home\u2014to remark, \" Though he had been present\nat many a deathbed for heaven, he had never seen one\nequal to hers ; \"\u2014and she a professed Spiritualist, and the\nwife of one ot the most noted mediums in the world !\n\u2014\nTo ascribe, I repeat, such results to the agency of the\nfather of lies and the arch enemy of mankind, must\nappear as impossible to many, as it must be revolting to\nthe two gifted writers whom I have quoted, and who bear\nsuch strong testimony to the blessed influence which\nSpiritualism has exercised upon their own lives and faith.\nAttention should also be called to the seances at Homburg,\nespecially Nos. 19, 21, 22, where the action of the spirits\nwas decidedly exercised in various ways to promote bodily\nhealth and comfort, and also to inculcate and reiterate the\nadvantage of good practices, such as examination of con-\nscience at night ; still more striking was the evident\nanxiety on their part to prevent and counteract grievous\nsin, as must be quite clear to those who read these\naccounts with attention. Remarks upon this subject might\nbe considerably amplified ; but enough has been pointed\nout to indicate some of the difficulties which surround the\nadoption of the evil-spirit hypothesis. Indeed the only\nanswer which can be given, by those who maintain this\nview, is that Satan is allowed an unlimited power, of\nwhich he makes copious use, of transforming himself into\nan angel of light.\nSetting aside the religious question, and admitting even\nthat the spirits are those of departed human beings, the\ndifficulty of identification renders the whole subject in its\npresent stage rather unsatisfactory. This opinion, I know,\nis to a considerable extent shared in by persons who have\nbeen for several years believers in Spiritualism. Among\n' Vide Mr. Home's \"Incidents in my Life,\" chap. xii.\n\f40 Introductory Remarks\nthose who took part in the following seances, some seem to\nfind little or no difficulty in believing that the spirits in\ncommunication with them are the relatives or friends they\nprofessed to be. I confess in this confidence I cannot\nshare. To take an extreme case, the idea that the former\npossessor of Adare Manor should be present at a seance,\nand yet only manifest that presence by shaking his son's\nchair {No. 57, p. 199), seems as improbable as absurd.^\nWhatever view be taken of the source of the phenomena,\nthe subject is one deserving serious treatment, and careful\ninvestigation. The tone of levity which prevails in some\namateur seances, and the fashion now prevalent among\n3^oung ladies of playing with planehettes, cannot be too\nstrongly deprecated. A power, which practically may be\nlooked upon and treated of as new, has almost suddenly\nbeen developed among men ; a power which may be\nfraught in many cases with serious consequences. Are we\nin a position at present to pronounce from what sources\nthis power proceeds ? The veil which separates this world\nfrom the next is partially raised ; can we say why this\npartial unfolding of the future is permitted ; or to what\nextent it may be developed, or what is the main purpose\nfor which this unexpected source of knowledge, or decep-\ntion as the case may be, is revealed ? A partial but\ndecisive answer may be given to some of these questions.\nA proof, derived from a physical and material source is\nopened to men of an existence beyond the grave. The\ntendency of the present age being materialistic and\nsceptical, the evidence of the senses is required as a\nground for belief, to a degree far surpassing what has\nhitherto been the case ; that evidence is now afi^orded for\nthe most important of beliefs, namely, that of a future\nexistence. The true answer to those who require the cui\nhono of Spiritualism would appear, therefore, to be, that\nthrough its instrumentality an incontrovertible proof is\n1 Since these seances liave taken place, communications have been\nmade to Lord Adare (vide -p- 261) which, if genuine, would account for\nand explain why none were given at the time from the source men-\ntioned ; the probability, however, of identity is scarcely strengthened, in\nmy mind, by the tenor of these later communications.\n\fIntroductory Remarks 41\nafforded to all wlio will fairly, fully, and patiently investi-\ngate a world of spirits. This teaching stands out clear and\nunmistakable above any conflicting theories as to the kind\nof spirits who are the source of the communications.\nThat Spiritualism is not unaccompanied by danger is\nallowed, even by its most earnest believers. This chiefly\nsprings from the great power of deception which may be\nexercised by spirits, while the power of identification\nremains so unsatisfactory as it is at present. For example,\nmessages are sent, or communications in the trance state\ngiven, purporting to come from deceased members of a\nfamily, commenting on family affairs ; it is obvious that\nthis may be a source of serious mischief. If, as is allowed\nby all Spiritualists, bad and lying spirits can and do com-\nmunicate, what is to secure one from being deceived by\nthem in a particular case ? A friend of mine believed that\na spirit present at a seance was a gentleman who had been\nlately poisoned ; he asked if B was concerned in the\nmatter and was answered in the affirmative. This he\nappeared to believe, and thus B , who lives in his\nparish, to some extent lies under the imputation of being\nconcerned in a murder ; and this on the declaration of a\nspirit whose identity seemed to me to rest on no solid\nground.\nOne of the most remarkable features in these seances is\nthe frequency of Mr. Home's trances. This peculiar phase\nof his power has become much developed of late ; while\nothers, such as his being raised in the air, have compara-\ntively diminished. To those who are familiar with mes-\nmeric trances, the genuineness of ]\\Ir. Home's is easily\nadmitted. To me they are among the most interesting\nportions of the manifestations which occur through his\nmediumship. The change which takes place in him is very\nstriking ; he becomes, as it were, a being of a higher type.\nThere is a union of sweetness, tenderness, and earnestness\nin his voice and manner which is very attractive. At first\nsight much might appear to be skilful acting ; but after\nhaving so frequently witnessed these trance states, I am\nfully convinced of their truthfulness. Sometimes his utter-\nances are most impressive ; the language beautiful, con-\n\f42 Introductory Remarks\nveying his thoughts in the most appropriate words. That\nhe is possessed by a power or spirit, not his own, and\nsuperior to himself, a very Httle experience will suffice to\nrender manifest. I can most fully endorse the statement\nin Lord Adare's preface\u2014of the very imperfect conception\nof the impressiveness of some of these seances as conveyed\nby our meagre reports. They are, as it were, mere\nskeletons, as for example. No. 55 ; no one could imagine\nthe beauty and interest of that seance, from the very\ninadequate account given there of what occurred. To be\nappreciated or realized they must be witnessed, and that\nunder favourable circumstances. Those who have been\npresent will, I am sure, agree with me that some of them\nare very touching and beautiful. A pure, lofty, and\nreligious tone more or less pervades them. The solemnity\nwhich is always manifested at the name of God is remark-\nable. After reading Mr. Chevalier's pamphlet^ I was\nanxious to apply the test of using the invocation of the\nTrinity. I never mentioned this to Mr. Home ; but it was\nunexpectedly suggested by him when entranced during the\nseance, No. 59, and with a totally opposite result, as the\nreader wUl see.* The effect produced upon Mr. Home by\nPressense's \" Life of Christ \" was very striking. I have\nnever seen such reverence paid to the Bible in real Ufe ;\nit reminded one of the devotion exhibited by a Catholic\nto the Blessed Sacrament.\nAnother very remarkable feature and weU worthy of\nattention, is the account given by the spirits of the mode\nby which they are able to make manifestations, as is\ndetailed in pp. 117, 212, and other places ; also the ex-\ntreme difficulty experienced in making them, and the slight\ncauses which interrupt the power. In fact, when one\nconsiders the number of favourable conditions necessary in\norder that manifestations should succeed, the wonder is\n^ Experiences in Spiritualism ; or the Adjuration of Spirits. . . . By\na late member of Mr. Home's Spiritual Athenaeum [i.e. J. O. Chevalier].\nLondon, 1867.\n- Mr. Chevalier states that when he asked the spirit who it was, using\nthe names of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the word ''Devil'' was\nspelled out.\n\fIntroductory Remarhs 43\nthat they do not oftener fail. Nothing can be plainer than\nthat the power of spirits over matter is one of degree,\nvarying each night, and indeed almost every minute. This\nis the answer to those who are constantly remarking \" If\nthey can do tliis, why cannot they do that 1 If a spirit\ncan raise an object an inch, why not a yard 1 If Mr.\nHome could float in the air last week, why can he not\nto-day ?\n\" and so forth. The causes of failure are weU\nexemplified in the last seayice at Garinisli, No. 63, when\napparently, numbers were present, and evidently they had\nintended giving us a series of manifestations as a wind up\nto the seances in Ireland ; but this design was partly\nfrustrated by the state of the weather and Mr. Home's\nhealth, as well as our own rather unfavourable condition.\nA very common misconception on the general subject\nought to be here pointed out. The idea seems very preva-\nlent that Mr. Home invokes or evokes spirits. This notion\nis totally destitute of foundation. Neither Mr. Home, nor\nany medium, as far as I know ever professes to call up\nspirits. Several persons sit round a table, and Mr. Home,\nwhile deprecating levity, desires to promote cheerful and\nsocial conversation on general matters, without any premedi-\ntated design or wish expressed that particular things should\nhappen or particular spirits be present. Some Spiritualists\nbegin every sitting with prayer, and generally with a\nchapter in the Bible. I was at one lately, where, as soon\nas the presence of spirits was announced by raps, they\nwere asked, should we begin by reading a chapter ;\n\" Yes,\"\nwas the reply ; and they were then asked, what chapter\nit should be, and they rapped out, \" Acts, xi. chapter,\nverses, 5 to 18.\" One more appropriate could not readily\nbe selected.\nBefore concluding these introductory remarks, I would\nremind the reader, that the primary object of this little\nwork is to place on record a series of observed facts upon\na very mysterious and startling subject. It is only by\nsuch means, pursued under varying circumstances, as to\ntime, place, and mediums, multiplied by different observers,\nthat a conclusive answer can be hoped for to the question.\nWill the result of Spiritualism he good or evil ? is the\n\f44 Introductory Remarks\ntendencj^ of the movement as a whole to the glory of God,\nand the happiness of mankind in the next world, or, is it\na great system of deception, carried on by the powers of\ndarkness, and fraught with danger to our souls ? Setting\naside the great majority of the world, who refuse aU\nenquiry into a subject which they consider to be impos-\nture, or ridiculous nonsense, unworthy of serious thought,\nmany shrink from it as the work solely of evil spirits\n;\nothers, from a fear of the danger derived from the difficulty\nof identification, and the consequent deception which may\nbe practised ; and others again from an instinctive dread of\ncommuning with the departed, and from an intense pain\ncaused by the idea that the state of those whom they\nhave loved should be so widely different from, and appar-\nently so much lower than what they have fondly believed\nin, through the traditionary teaching under which they\nhave been brought up. Nor can we omit in fairness the\nopinion of many of the opponents of Spiritualism who\nmaintain, that the examples of its being productive of\ngood effects are exceptional, and that the system must be\njudged by its general results, which, as developed in\nAmerica, are, they say, drifting away from anything like\northodox Christianity. This statement I am not in a\nposition to be able to pronounce upon one way or the\nother.\nWithout attempting to conceal my own state of doubt\nas to the source from which the phenomena of Spiritualism\nproceed, and my decided impression of the danger which in\nsome respects seems possibly to accompany its pursait or\nadoption, I have been most desirous not to bias unduly\nthose who are anxious to investigate a very interesting and\nmost curious subject of enquiry ;\nespecially as Lord Adare\ntakes a more favourable view than I can at present con-\nscientiously hold, of the points about which such opposite\nopinions are entertained by men of earnest and truth-\nloving character. Why then, it may be asked, take any\npart in enquiring into a subject, the tendency of which\nseems so difficult to determine ? The answer is simple :\n\u2014\nChiefly, to examine for my own satisfaction ;\nnext, to\nenable others, who may consider a similar spirit of enquiry\n\fIntroductory Remarks 45\nadvisable or interesting, to have the benefit of the ex-\nperience derived from the following seances ; and also, to\nshew to those who are already struck by, or much\noccupied in, the pursuit of this mysterious subject, the\ndangers by which it is surrounded, through the possible\ntendencies of its teachings, or the deceptions practicable by\nbad or mischievous spirits. I maintain that we are entitled\nto investigate all the physical phenomena which may come\nbefore us, provided we do so earnestly and with a desire\nto arrive at truth. Acting upon this principle, I enquired\ninto the remarkable phenomena of mesmerism and clair-\nvoyance, when the propriety of so doing was doubted by\nsome for whom I entertained the highest respect. Upon\nthe same principle I now avail myself of the opportunity\nwhich Lord Adare's acquaintance with Mr. Home has\nafforded, of investigating the still more interesting and\nstartling phenomena of Spiritualism ; content that time\nwill clear up that which is at present so perplexing, and\nenable honest enquirers to decide whether the subject is\none which they can with propriety continue to pursue, or\none which they feel themselves bound, as sincere followers\nof Christ, and for the safety of their souls, to abandon.\n\fNAMES OF PERSONS PRESENT AT THE SEANCES ^\n[All the persons present at the following seances, with the\nexception of three or four to wliom access cannot be obtained,\nhave received a copy of the account of the seances which they\nwitnessed, with a request that if the report coincided with\ntheir own recollection of what took place, they would kindly\nallow their names to be appended, as testifying to its accuracy.\nEvery answer has been in the affirmative as to the correctness\nof the accounts ; but a very few have, for prudential reasons,\npreferred that their names should not appear.

We were\nshown into the back parlour, a small room, the furniture\nconsisting of a heavy round mahogany table, without any\ncover, with one leg in the centre, and of a piano and\nseveral ordinary chairs. The room was lighted by a fire,\na large lamp standing on the piano, and two wax candles\non the table.\nAfter Mrs. Thayer came in we sat and talked for a\nfew minutes by the fireside, until at Home's suggestion\nwe sat round the table, which was in the middle of the\nroom. Home was on my left, Mrs. Thayer opposite me,\nand Earl on my right. The room was perfectly light.\nAfter talking on ordinary subjects for perhaps ten minutes,\nraps were heard by us all in various parts of the room, on\nthe table and on the floor and walls. Home requested\nthe raps to be made in various places and it was done.\nHe asked that they would rap under my feet, and I not\nonly heard the noise, but distinctly felt the jar while the\nraps were taking place. I repeatedly looked under the\ntable, as did also Mr. Earl, to satisfy ourselves that,\nhowever they were done, it was not by any movement on\nHome's part. It was quite impossible that Home could\nhave made them, for while they were distinctly audible,\nI looked under the table and could have detected even\nthe slightest movement of his legs or feet ; Mr. Earl\nwatched his hands and arms. Similar raps were occasion-\n4S\n\fRecord of Seances 49\nally heard during the whole seance. At the commence-\nment of the seance we all felt cold cun^ents of air passing\nover our hands. The table began to vibrate with the\ngreatest rapidity, and was then moved about and tilted up\nin various directions. Mrs. Thayer had previously to this\nplaced a pencil and writing paper on the table. The\ntable was repeatedly tilted up at an angle I should say\ngreater than 45\u00b0. The surface was smooth polished\nmahogany, yet the candles, paper, and pencil did not\nmove. Home asked that the candles might slip (as they\nnaturally would), and they did slide down the table until\nnear the edge, when at his request they remained station-\nary. While the table was tilted up very high, Home said\nto Earl, \" Take a candle and look under the table.\"\nHe took one of the candles on the table, and in lifting it\nsaid, good gracious, how heavy it is ! I afterwards tried\nthe same thing, and found that when the table was tilted\nup there was a difficulty in removing the candle from the\nsurface that made it appear very heavy. The table was\nmoved up against my chest, and as I pushed back my\nchair, it followed me up until the back of my chair was\nagainst the window, and I could go no further ; the\ntable was then pushed close up against me. I now felt\ncold currents of air passing across my face and hands,\nand a chair that was standing against the wall, at a\ndistance of perhaps five yards, came suddenly and quickly\nout from the wall, and placed itself beside me at the table.\nThe effect was starthng. There was a lady's cloak on it,\nwhich was pulled off under the table. Mrs. Thayer said,\n\" She could see a shadowy form standing between Home\nand me.\" I saw nothing, but I was touched lightly on\nthe head, and distinctly as with a sharp tap of the finger\non the knee. I do not think it possible that anybody at\nthe table could have touched me. I could see all their\nhands, and had it been done by a foot I must have per-\nceived the difference of touch, and have seen the motion.\nSome time previously to this Mrs. Thayer had sent out the\nservant to ask a friend for an accordion, and it had been\nplaced upon the table. The alphabet was called for (by\nfive raps) and the following words were spelled out (I am\nD\n\f50 Experiences in Sinritualistn [seance\nnot sure that I remember the exact words but they were\nto this effect) :\n\u2014\" \/ could not come the other night because\nof H . Yours ever, Fred.'' Mrs. Thayer understood\nthe meaning of this message it having reference to a\nprevious seance, the first one, I beheve, at which she had\nbeen present. After a few minutes the alphabet was again\ncalled for, and the following words were spelled out : \u2014\n\u2022\n\" My hoy I am near you.\" I naturally referred this to\nmy mother.\nAfter this, the accordion was moved about on the table.\nHome took it, holding it by the lower part, with the\nkeys hanging down over the edge of the table. It is\nmanifestly impossible for a person so holding an accordion\neither to touch the keys, to inflate the bellows, or to\nexpel the air from it. Almost immediately the keys were\ntoitched in an uncertain manner, and then the accordion\nbegan to play. It played something resembling a voluntary\non the organ : the melody was perfect, and the expression\nbeautiful. I am sure that if I had heard it so played\nanywhere, under any circumstances, it would have occurred\nto me how like the music was to what I had often heard\nmy mother play, when running over a few chords on the\npiano. While the accordion was being played, I looked at\nit two or three times under the table. Home was on\neach occasion holding it as I have stated, and the instru-\nment was pulled out horizontally from his hand. I could\nsee the bellows drawn in and out, and the keys move.\nAt one time it was pulled violently under the chair at\nmy side towards me. Home asked me to name some\nair. I wished to think of one that might help me to\nidentify whoever was playing the accordion, but I could\nnot. Earl asked for \" The Last Rose of Summer.\" It\nwas beautifully played : first, the air quite simple, then\nwith chords and variations. After this Mrs. Thayer took\nthe accordion, and Mr. Earl also, but it did not play\nagain. During what I have narrated, the table was\noccasionally moved, and raps were now and then heard in\ndifferent parts of the room. All manifestations ceased\nwhen the accordion stopped playing. My hands during\nthe whole time were as cold as ice ; when the manifes-\n\fNO. 1] With D. D. Home 51\ntations ceased they became suddenly warm. I said,\n\" Dear me, my hands have become quite warm !\n\" Home\nsaid, \" Oh, then I am afraid there will be nothing more.\"\nWe waited perhaps five minutes ;\nand, finding there were\nno more manifestations, we got up and moved the table\nover to the fire. Home began reading to us some poetry.\nThe last thing he read was descriptive of the passing\naway of a poor old widow ;\nand, after a passage speaking\nof the love of Christ for her, strong raps of approval\n\u2014\nthat is, three raps in succession\u2014were heard on the floor\nbehind him. We then said Good-night to Mrs. Thayer,\nand went back to Tudor House. I turned into the dining\nroom and sat down by the fire alone. A few minutes\nafter. Home came in and sat down by me, and we talked\nabout ordinary subjects. We heard a sound that I thought\nwas the door creaking. He said it was not that, and\nasked that the sound should be repeated, and it was.\nHe then asked that it should rap where I usually sat at\ndinner ; and it did so right at the end of the table.\nWe were both sitting with our backs to the table. Then\ncame a noise as if furniture was moving. I turned but\nsaw nothing move. Home looked and said a chair had\nmoved up to the table. I looked again at the other side\nof the table, and saw that a chair was standing against\nit ; aU the others were against the waU. I did not see\nit move. We then heard a sort of whistKng sound flying\nup and down the room ; then a sound as of something\nrushing up and down, and then, laughter, unmistakable\nbut not pleasant sounding laughter. After this one of the\nservants came in, and nothing more occurred. When in\nthe dining room. Home asked whether the spirit that was\nthere in the room was one that loved me. It answered\n\" Yes.\" By \" answered,\" I mean that three raps were given,\nwhich means \" Yes.\" He asked if the spirit would like\nme to have another seance with him in London. \" Yes,\"\nwas answered.\n\f52 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nNo. 2 Seance.\nAbout a fortnight after this I had occasion to go to\nLondon. I went down to see Home at Mr. Jencken's,\nat Norwood. We had a seance in the evening. There were\npresent, Home, Mr. Jencken, Mrs. Hennings, and myself.\nNothing very remarkable occurred ; at least, I do not\nremember anything. The usual manifestations took place,\nsuch as the table moving, and raps were heard ; the\ntable, a light card table, was lifted off the ground com-\npletely. During the first part of the seance the manifes-\ntations seemed all directed to Home, afterwards the\ntable was in the same way as at the first seance moved\nup against me. The accordion was played in Home's\nhand. The last thing that occurred was that my chair\nbegan to vibrate rapidly in the most violent way ; it\ngave me a curious tingling sensation up my arms to the\nelbow, and up my legs as though I was receiving an\nelectric shock. Knowing that this vibration almost in-\nvariably preceded any movement, or lifting of the table,\nI thought that I was going to be raised into the air,\nand most unwillingly I became very nervous and fright-\nened. If I had not done so I think some phenomenon\nwould have occurred ; but as soon as I became alarmed,\nthe vibration of my chair ceased. That was the last thing\nthat occurred that evening.\nNo. 3 Seance.\nThis day week I again went down to Mr. Jencken's\nto see Home. After tea we had a seance. There were\npresent : Mr. Jencken, Mrs. Jencken (his mother), Mrs.\nHennings, Mrs. Scott Russell, Miss D R ,\nanother\nlady whose name I forget, Home and myself. We sat\nround the card table, all except Mrs. Jencken, who sat\nin her arm chair in another part of the room. We had\na very beautiful seance. Miss D R had never been\npresent at one before, and was most of the time engaged\nin looking under the table, and investigating what took\nplace. Very few raps were heard. The manifestations\n\fNO. 3] With D. D. Home 53\nbegan by the usual vibration of the table, the floor, and\nour chairs ;\nand by the cold currents of air passing round\nthe table over our hands. The table moved, and we\nfollowed it until it was in a corner close to the wall.\nHome had his back to the wall. On his left, at a little\ndistance, was a small square table, with a vase of flowers\non it ;\nand on his right was a small round table, on\nwhich stood a large vase containing a fern.\nThe chief part of the manifestations consisted in the\nmovement of these tables. They were brought close to\nHome, and then were sometimes raised in the air and\ninclined towards him ; sometimes simply tilted on one leg,\nso that the flowers touched his face. The flowers were\nin like manner also, as it were, presented to Mrs. Hen-\nnings and Mrs. Scott Russell. Before moving the small\nround table up to us, it was necessary to clear a space\nfor it, as the table at which we were sitting was close to\nthe window. Our table moved a little back, and we\nthen saw the window curtains drawn on one side out of\nthe way. This table was repeatedly raised in the air\nto the height of 4 or 5 inches. Miss D R .\nplacing\nher hands between it and the floor; and it was also\nfrequently inclined at such an angle that the vase must\ninevitably have fallen off under ordinary circumstances.\nThe flowers on the square table and the fern on the\nround table were frequently agitated and moved, but\nwere not broken ofl^ or plucked. On placing the ear\nagainst the smaU table, it was found to be full of minute\nraps, like a current of small electric sparks.\nThe phenomena connected with the movement of these\ntwo tables occupied some time, during which we talked\nabout various matters and subjects. Miss D R .\nand Mi\\ Jencken were talking about Spirituahsm, and he\ngot rather excited, and was saying something to the effect\nthat he lost his patience when people said it was ah\ntrickery and conjuring, and that instead of that it was a\ngreat and real blessing and dispensation vouchsafed to us\nby God for our comfort. Approving raps occurred at\nthis, and he said \"Is it not to shew us without doubt\nthat it is so,\" or some words of that sort. Assent was\n\f54 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nsignified to tlitit remark so emphatically that it made me\nlaugh. It seemed so energetic\u2014first, \" Yes \" was rapped\non the floor and walls, then the small tables tilted them-\nselves three times, and then the table we were sitting\nround tilted itself up towards each corner in turn three\ntimes, and lastly, being raised right off the ground, was\nmoved up and down three times in the air, and then\ncame down with an emphatic bang that shook the floor.\nDuring this seance, it was remarkable how the spirits\njoined as it were in our conversation, two or three times\nsignifying approval in the most emphatic way. I noticed\na remarkable circumstance in connection with the small\nround table. When it was inclined at a considerable\nangle I saw the vase move, but instead of slipping down\nthe slope, it moved up against it.\nAs I before mentioned, the small table with the fern\nwas raised in the air, and presented as if in greeting to\nMrs. Hennings, Home, and Mrs. Scott Russell. After this\nhad been done several times the alphabet was called for,\nand the following message given (the exact words I\ncannot answer for) :\n\" We would do more to shew our\nlove ; these (referring to the flowers) are emblems of God's\nlove.'' The letters were indicated sometimes by the small\ntable tilting, sometimes by raps on the large table. Soon\nafterwards the alphabet was again called for, and the follow-\ning message given :\n\u2014\" Sit alone in a corner with Adare.\"\nAccordingly Home and I left the table, and sat in another\ncorner of the room at the small round table, having\npreviously removed the vase ;\nimmediately the table was\nraised up and tilted against my chest. The table had\none leg terminating in three claws, one of them just\ntouched my toe, and the letters were indicated by the\nclaw tapping my toe. The following message was thus\ngiven :\n\u2014\" My oivn boy, I go with you, fear nothing, God\nwill give a mother 2^ower to protect her own boy. I will\nyet speak to you tvhen alone.\" The table was then raised\noff the ground, presented to m^e close to my face, two\nor three times, and replaced on the floor. Home was not\ntouching the table ; but during aU this time was sitting\nbeside me in an arm chair, and I distinctly felt\u2014and so\n\fNO. 3] With D. D. Home 55\ndid he\u2014some one standing between us. We then went\nback to the large table and Home took the accordion\nin his hand. He asked some questions, which were\nanswered in the affirmative by three single notes on the\naccordion. Home in asking these questions became very\nmuch affected\u2014I do not know why\u2014and his voice was\nquite broken ; he asked whether the spirit holding the\naccordion was the same that brought the chair to me at\nMalvern ? ^ Whether it had not stood between me and\nhim when we were sitting in the corner ? The accordion\nthen played something like a voluntary on the organ.\nThe peculiarity being that the last few notes were drawn\nout so fine as to be scarcely audible\u2014the last note dying\naway so gradually that I could not tell when it ceased.\nI do not think it possible for any human hand to pro-\nduce a note in that way. Sometime before this we had\nall heard a whistling over Home's head, similar to that\nwhich I had heard in the dining room at Tudor House.\nIt is a curious sound, something between a bird chirping\nand the whistling produced by birds' wings rapidly moving.\nAfter it ceased we all heard sounds as of a voice, but\nnot articulate. Home then asked if a spirit was en-\ndeavouring to make the voice heard, and was answered\n\" Yes, \" and he asked if it would be repeated, and was\nanswered \"Perhaps.'' It was not repeated until we left\nthe table. During the time the sounds were heard Home\nwas talking, which I was glad of, as I wished to feel\nsure the sounds were not the result of ventriloquism on\nhis part. I believe I may also safely say that we were\nall engaged in conversation at the time, so that the\nsounds could not have been produced by any accomplice\namong us. I did not, however, observe any of the\nothers so closely as I did Home.\nAfter the accordion had played I took it in my hand\nbut immediately after I had done so the alphabet was\ncalled for and the words were spelled out, \" We can do\nno more 7ioiv.\" All the manifestations then ceased. We\nwaited a few minutes, and Home asked if the spirits\n1 There is no answer recorded to Home's questions, but I believe the\nanswer to have been in the affirmative.\n\f50 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nwere gone. No answer was returned, so we left the\ntable. I had particularly noticed three things.\n1st. That the commencement of each seance appears\nthe same, namely, currents of cold air passing over the\nhands of those at the table as if some sort of chain was\nbeing formed. Any abrupt breaking of which by some\none suddenly leaving the table will stop the phenomena.\n2nd. That if the attention be too much concentrated it\nprevents the phenomena. They take place best when\nthose at the table are keeping up a general conversation.\nIf anything occurs, such as a table moving, and every-\nbody stops talking and looks at it, it is almost sure to\nstop. In the last seance, I noticed that when anything\nof that sort was being done, if every one turned to look\nat it and stopped talking, the table or some other piece\nof furniture moved as it were to attract attention. I\nforgot to mention that Home at the last seance was\nthrown into a trance. He remained entranced two or\nthree minutes, but said nothing. We foolishly all stopped\ntalking to look at him, and I think that broke the trance,\nas he awoke, passed his hand across his forehead, and\nremarked how quiet we all were.\nAt the commencement of a trance Home generally\ntells the spectators to go on talking ; not to fix their\nattention on him too much at first. I think that as\nnegative a condition of mind as can possibly be maintained\nis almost a necessity to ensure strong manifestations.\nThis is not however the case, I believe, with all mediums.\nThe presence of dogs in the room, or much tobacco smoke,\nwill entirely prevent manifestations with Home as medium.\nThe efi'ect of these things is, no doubt, upon the medium,\nnot upon the spiritual influence.\nZrd. That the name of God is always treated with\npeculiar reverence. In spelling out a sentence, if you\nguess an ordinary word, they say \" Yes \" ; and go on\nto the next. But though you may guess it, they spell\nout each letter in the name of God, and instead of in-\ndicating the letters quicldy, as usual, it is done in a slow\nmanner that impresses the mind with an idea of great\nreverence.\n\fNO. 4] With D. D. Home 57\nNo. 4 Seance\u2014London, November 2lst\u2014Recorded by\nmy Father.\nMr. Home came to my house, oiily Miss Gallwey and\nAdare being jDresent. We sat round a small table in my\nstudy. We talked about different subjects, wiiich Mr.\nHome says is preferable to silence, or to thinking or\nwishing too much on the one subject. Soon slight raps\nwere heard, followed by slight vibrations of the table.\nWe all agreed that the noise in the street was very\ndisagreeable, so we adjourned to the dining room, which\nMr. Home had never been in. I took in the table,\nand, placing it near the fire place, we sat round it.\nRaps soon came again, and slight vibrations. Some one\nremarked that the table was rather creaky, when Mr.\nHome observed, \" I have taken a dislike to this table ;\nlet us sit at another. Here, this dining table will do.\"\n\" What,\" I said, \" surely that huge table will not move !\n\"\n\"Oh, I daresay it will,\" he replied. The table was very\nlarge, above seven feet long and five feet wide, and very\nheavy, requiring considerable force to move it at all.\nUnder it is a Turkey carpet ; there were also quantities\nof Adare's things upon it. Mr. Home and I sat\nopposite each other at the sides, and Adare and Miss\nGallwey at the ends. Raps were heard at different parts\nof the table, and near the fire place, and on the round\ntable we had brought in. Presently the table vibrated\nvery strongly\u2014this was a most strange phenomenon,\nthe vibration was so uniform and powerful. The table\nthen moved at right angles to ]\\Ir. Home. I may remark\nthat there was a green cloth on the table, and when\npressure was used, the hand would simply slip on the\npolished mahogany. The table moved towards Adare\nabout a foot ; and it soon moved towards Miss Gallwey,\nthat is, in exactly the opposite direction. She said.\n\" May I stop it 1\n\" \"I dont tliink you can,\" Home\nrephed. \" Yes I can,\" she said, as she pressed her hands\nforcibly against the edge ; then suddenly withdrawing them\nfrom the table, it made one move, or rather spring\nforward, of nearly one foot in length, thus shewing the\n\f58 Ex})eriences in Spiritualism [seance\ngreat strength of the pressure which must have been\nexerted by some mysterious power. We heard sounds\nfrom the Httle table, and I saw it moving by itself.\nIt had advanced more than a foot towards Mr. Home\n;\nand it came still nearer afterwards. He sat rather back\nfrom the table, with his hands laid lightly on it.\nI expressed a hope that the power would become\nstronger. These messages were given :\n\u2014\" We would fain\ndo more if we could ; did love give strength, tve should he strong\nindeed.\" And then \" God bless you all ! \" The indications\nfor \" God \" differed from the others, being three strong\nvibrations of the table. After this we heard or felt\nnothing more. As to collusion or contrivances, none such\ncould have taken place ; the change of Toom, and our\nclose observation, rendered this impossible. The idea of\nour hands being able to move such a table is simply\nabsurd. The table, too, moved at right angles to where\nHome was sitting. The vibration was very singular\n;\nthe candles shook, and other things trembled visibly.\nOnce the candles very decidedly diminished in brightness\nfor a short time.\nNo. 5 Seance\u2014November 23rd.\u2014Recorded by my Father.\nA seance was held at Norwood. Present : Mr. Home,\nMrs. Hennings, Mr. Jencken and his mother, Mrs. Scott\nRussell, Adare, and myself. We sat at an ordinary card\ntable in the middle of the room, with two candles on\nthe chimney piece, and a bright fire. After about ten\nminutes, raps were heard : the table vibrated a little,\nand soon moved in the direction of Mr. Home, and\ntowards the piano. We followed, and were soon close to\nthe broad end of the piano. Raps were heard on and\nabout the table, and on a small table a few feet distant.\nOur table gradually tilted up, at an angle of about\n30 degrees or more. This was done more than once.\nThe narrow end of the piano moved from the wall two\nor three times, and altogether about one foot, and\npressed Mrs. Scott Russell between itself and the table.\n\fNO. 5] With D. D. Home 59\nTlie floor vibrated strongly ; this was very striking. The\nfive raps were heard for the alphabet, and the following\nsentence was spelled out :\n\u2014\" You are over anxious, and\nnot sufficiently jwayerful.''' Different movements of the\ntable occurred, and then the following sentence was\ngiven :\n\u2014\" On {? in) seeking for physical facts you lose\nsight of God.\" It was very remarkable that the indications\nfor the word \" God \" were made, not by common raps,\nbut by the table giving sudden movements, whilst it was\neither partially or wholly off the ground. At the end it\nwas clearly so ; and it made the sign of the cross by\nmoving forward and backward, and from side to side.\nBefore this the little table moved of itself, and I went\nclose to it, and I saw it move again slightly. It vibrated\nslightly when Mr. Home did not touch it, but more\nstrongly when he did. We then got the accordion, and\nMr. Home held it just under the table. After a little\nwhile it moved about and at last played, but apparently\nat first with effort, a sort of plaintive melody, very\npretty, but nothing I had ever heard. I looked under\nthe table more than once while ]\\Ir. Home's hand held\nit, and I saw it playing. At one time it was held up\nwithout his aid, for he put both his hands on the table,\nand I was then watching it. It stretched from Mr.\nHome, towards Mrs. RusseU, who took it, and it played,\nbut faintly. Home took it back. Alphabet then called\nfor, and the following message came:\n\u2014\n\"It was A. who\ntouched the keys.'' After this the accordion stretched\nnearly horizontally towards me, and I took it, \u2014and\nheld it a long time, but it did not play, though it was\nmoved about strangely, and distinct raps were made on\nit. Before this Mr. Home said he distinctly saw a spirit\nbetween Mrs. Scott Russell and me, and before he spoke,\nshe said she was touched in the side\u2014I was conscious\nof nothing. The cold currents were very sensible co-\nnight. After this the manifestations became feeble, and\nwhile remarking this, the alphabet was called for, and\nthe following given :\n\u2014\" Daniel is 7iot in a good state.\"\nWe waited longer, but nothing occurred. Mr. Home\non one occasion said, \" There are curious influences\n\f00 Ex'periences in S'piritucilisni [seance\nto-night \" ; and he then said his feet were moved about in\na strange way, and he was touched more than once.\nJust before the seance began, Mr. Home was called\nsuddenly away to see a man on business, and this rather\ndisturbed him. When the floor was vibrating strongly\nsome one said it could be felt in the next house ; and\nit was proposed that one of us should go in there, and\nnote the time. Raps of approval were given twice ;\nbut, somehow, Mr. Home said nothing, and no one went.\nI forgot to mention that when the sheet of paper was\non the table, Mr. Home touching one corner, the other\nend was Jifted uj) more than an inch, just at the time\nwhen Adare felt the cold currents very strongly, as\nmight happen if a bellows were blown near it. The\npaper was also rather curled up.\nNo. 6 Seance.\nWe had a seance the other night at Mr. Jencken's, at\nNorwood. Home went gradually into a trance ; his eyes\nwere quite shut ; he got up, moved one or two chairs,\nwalked up and down the room, then sat down again\nand began to speak. Mr. Jencken had been telling us\nhow one of the servants, Mally, was ill, and had been\nseeing phosphorescent balls of light in her room at night.\nHome being in a trance, said, \" It was Hans made the\nlights in Mally' s rooms ; if you all go presently into the\nnext room, he will show them to you. MaUy's mother\nwill pass away within, (I forget the exact time mentioned),\nMally must not be told this.\" After a pause, he turned\nto me and said, \" Do not let Daniel leave your house\non Saturday, as he wishes to do, because your friend is\ncoming ; we want to let you hear music in your room,\nand we wish Daniel to stay.\" He then said, \" Adare's\nmother and Caroline are here.\" After a jjause he said\nagain to me, \" Daniel will be able to see you from time\nto time when you are away.\" After sitting a little time\nin his chair, in an attitude of prayer, he got up and\n\fNO. 6] With D. D. Home 61\nwalked round the table to me, and stood behind\nme with his hand raised as in prayer, and then pro-\nceeded to make passes over me ; I felt nothing. He\nheld his hand out, made a hollow of it as if to hold a\nfluid, and went through the action of pouring out some-\nthing upon my head ; he then walked behind me, and\napparently prayed for some time, then placing his\nhands upon my shoulders he drew me back towards him\nand pressed his head firmly against my back ; I felt a\nstrong current of heat flow out of his hands into my\nshoulders, and out of his head into my back. It was\nvery hot indeed. He then went back to his place and\nsat down, then raising his hands, as if praying, he spoke\nas follows :\n\u2014(Mr. Jencken took notes as well as he could\nof what was said, but as Home spoke rapidly without any\nstop, it was impossible to put down more than the heads\nof his address.)\n\" Father of light, we, thy children, do approach thee\nin all humble reverence and confidence. We do beseech\nthee. Father of love, to grant us patience, charity,\nlove, that we may love others who are less fortunate\nthan ourselves. We pray that thou mayest remove the\nveil that slirouds the eternal life from our sight, and\nthat knowledge not of earth be given us. Grant that\nwe may be purified in heart and body : that we may\nlay aside our grosser earthly body and existence,\nand assume the robe of our eternal being. Grant\nthat hope be given us, hope ! that is the star that\nguides us ;\nguides us who know so little of the great\nworld of spirits beyond the grave, {after a pause) We,\nchildren of God, linger near you, the spirits, guardian\nangels, hover around jou, and guard and aid you in\nyour hour of trial and suffering. To us the spirit-land\nof higher spheres is like a beautiful planet, luminous,\nshining forth as our goal\u2014and spheres higher and higher\nstill, brighten as we advance in the vista of everlasting\nprogress. We cannot tell you all we know, for it is\nthe desire of more and more knowledge that impels you\nonward and upward. As men see a star and desire to\nknow about it, and know that others are beyond it, and\n\f62 ExjJeriences in Spiritualism [seance\ninvent instruments, and spend their lives in scientific\nresearch and in seeking after truth, so it is with you ;\nit would not be good for you to know aU, for there\nwould be no object for improvement and research. We\nknow all your sufferings and shortcomings, and what\nyou have to contend with, for have we not too been\nmortals, have we not wearied on the roadside, and had\nour times of agony and doubt ; but God, at the evening\nof our day, brought us home, and called in the weary\ntravellers. God called us into his fold and brought us\nhome, that we may be nearer to thee, 0 God. Our\nFather in creating beautiful things on earth, created them\nfor ever and ever, for all eternity, though they may fade\nto our sight ; so beauty, poetry, sunlight, and all that is\nharmonious are garnered up for ever. Even sound having\nleft the influence of this earth, goes on for ever down the\neverlasting corridors of space. Thus summer is again and\nagain refined into autumn, toned and softened down,\nsoftening down the wintry sky of the future, so too,\npurer impvilscs, nobler aspirations, leave their impress\nfor ever upon the waves of eternity\u2014like a wave of\nsound, the impulse moves on for ever. All of you have\nto grope your way in the dark paths of life, but we\nhover near you, carry your minds upwards from earth,\nwhisper to your heart that it may learn to aspire to God.\nHope and love are component parts of the Godhead.\nTruth is God ; waves may rise mountains high, but the\ngreat beacon truth shines forth over all the waves to guide\nus, lighting us on our way. From the eternal source\ngoes forth the eternal light to which we aspire. From\nthis great source emanates the small particle of light called\nour soul, dwelling in this body we live in\u2014The great God\nwho is light itself, for ever light us through all eternity,\"\nHome now spoke in a language none of us ever heard,\nthen said \"Oh, how very wonderful, how extraordinary !\n\"\nand turning to me, he said \" A spirit has been approved\nto go with you, sent by a higher spirit, one who has\ncharge of your past, your present and your future, your\nhigh guardian spirit. He knows the country and has\nbeen a chieftain in it. On earth he wore a large cross\n\fNO. 6] With D. D.

He will save your life on\ntwo occasions, you will know his name.\" Here Home\nspoke two strange words. I said to Mr. Jencken, \" Have\nyou written that down, for I have already forgotten it.\"\nHome smiled and said, \" You cannot write it down and\nyou cannot remember it, but you will recognize it when\nthe time comes.\" \" Guardian spirits are given to those\nwho go to foreign countries, to guide and aid them,\nwhereby they benefit themselves ;\ncharity brings good to\nthose that use it, more charity is gained by charity.\nNothing prevents you going, he has breathed on you\nonce, he will again, and once again, when you return,\nthen never more ; he will accompany you if nothing\noccurs to prevent your going ; he is very strong.\" Home\nnow got up, walked round to me, kneeled beside me as\nin prayer, and again drew me back by the shoulders,\nand pressed his head against my back, and I felt the\nsame current flow from his forehead as before. Home\nstood up and said, \" He is very strong and tall,\" and\nstanding there beside me. Home grew, I should say, at\nleast, six inches. Mr. Jencken, who is a taller man than\nHome, stood beside him, so there could be no mistake\nabout it. Home's natural height is, I believe, 5 feet\n10 inches. I should say he grew to 6 feet 4 inches or\n6 feet 6 inches. I placed my hands on his feet, and\nfelt that they were fairly level on the ground. He had\nslippers on, and he said, \" Daniel will shew you how it\nis,\" and he unbuttoned his coat. He was elongated from\nhis waist upwards, there was a space of, I suppose,\n4 inches between his waistcoat and the waistband of\nhis trowsers. He appeared to grow also in breadth and\nsize all over, but there was no way of testing that.\nHe diminished down to his natural size, and said, \" Daniel\nwill grow tall again \" ; he did so, and said, \" Daniel's\n\f64 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nfeet are on the ground,\" he walked about, and stamped\nhis feet. He returned to his natural size, and sitting\ndown, he said, \" Daniel is coming back now, sit down,\nand do not tell Daniel at once what he has said.\" In a\nfew seconds he awoke. After sitting a few minutes, he\nsaid, \" What can it mean, I hear a voice saying '\nGo\ninto the next room, go into the next room '\n1\n\" We\nall went into the drawing room ; it was quite dark.\nHome sat at the piano, and played a few notes. Mrs.\nHennings sat near him ; Mrs. Jencken a little way off ;\nMr. Jencken and I stood near the piano. Soon we\nobserved the light that we had been told we should see.\nA small luminous ball flitting about, sometimes very\nbrilliant ; the chords of the piano were swept, but the\nkeys were not touched. The piano was lifted off the\nground about 2 inches. I had my hand underneath, and\nit was again lifted about 2 inches, and then without\nany effort, I should say 8 inches higher. It was not\ntilted, but lifted bodily. We now heard loud raps,\nthe alphabet was called, and \" Oood flight \" spelled out.\nNothing more occurred.\nNo. 7 Seance.\nWe had a seance at No. 5, Buckingham Gate, the\nother night. Soon after sitting down the table began to\nshew evidence of some powerful influence about it. Mr.\nJencken had unfortunately to go away by the ten o'clock\ntrain. After he left, we went into the dining room, and\nsat at the small round table. We had paper and a pencil\non the table, and when the table was tilted the paper\nslipped off, which it does not generally do. I had been\nmentioning to Brinsley the fact that things on the table\ngenerally remain stationary, though it be raised to a\ngreat angle ; and we were all remarking how curious\nit was that it would not do so now. The next pheno-\nmena that occurred were entirely in connection with\nmaking the pajDer stay upon the table. Home said in\nall his experience he had never seen the same sort of\n\fNO, 7] With D. D. Home 65\nthing. His hand and arm were taken possession of,\nthat is to say, they became perfectly rigid, and were\nmoved quite independently of his will ; his fist was so\nfirmly closed that his fingers could not be opened ; and\nthe muscles of his wrist and arm felt like iron. He got\nup, and altered the position of one of the candles on the\nlarge table a few inches, and removed all our hands from\nthe table ;\nhe then commenced to mesmerise the paper,\npointing at it with the first and middle finger\u2014the\nothers being clenched\u2014making rapid passes over it, and\nmaking circles round it on the table with great rapidity.\nThe table was rapidly tilted up till its edge touched\nthe floor. Being a table with one central support it\nwas nearly, but not quite, perpendicular\u2014the paper\nremained without slipping for some httle time. We requested\nthat it might be moved. His hand was agitated above it,\nand the edges of the paper were blown up, apparently\nby the current caused by his hand. The paper slipped\nto the ground ; he took it and rubbed it round and\nround on the table, and then tried to leave it on the centre\nof the table. It would not, however, remain quite fixed,\nslipping a little. Getting rather tired of this. Home\nasked if we might not put the table in its place and all\nsit round it again. We were told \" Yes \" ; and did so.\nThe following sentences were then spelled out :\n\" We\ndid it to gratify you \" ;\n\" We have power to make the table\nheavy:' We tried, asking it to become heavy and fight,\nand it did as we required. A number of messages were then\ngiven, all having reference to Miss D R . None\nof us knew the people they purported to come from, or\nanything about the circumstances they had reference to.\nShe had some difficulty in believing that an uncle of hers\nwas present as represented, and as a test of identity the\nfollowing was spelt by someone else : ''He alivays signed\nhis name ,\" mentioning a peculiar way in which\nhe signed. AU the rest of the seance consisted in mes-\nsages and answers to Miss D R ,\namounting to\na conversation, and having some reference to matters that we\ndid not understand. We were wished Good night at the end.\nThe table was sometimes very violent in its movements.\nE\n\f66 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nNo. 8 Seance\u2014November, 186'\/.\nMy dear Father,\u2014I went down yesterday to Norwood,\nand dined with Mr. Jencken. I was very much disappointed\nto find that Home had settled to go up to London after\ndinner, to hear a lecture by Miss Emma Hardinge. I\nshould much have preferred spending the evening quietly\nthere. We all tried to persuade him to stop, but in\nvain. However, after dinner he recited us some poetry,\nand to our great satisfaction he went on until he missed\nthe train. We then talked for some time, and had some\nmusic. Mrs. Jencken played us some very pretty httle\nmusical airs. While Mrs. Jencken, Home, and Miss D\nR were at the piano there came raps upon it. Mr.\nJencken and I were sitting some way off at the table.\nShortly after, Home suggested that we should sit round\nthe table. The room was lighted by a bright fire and\ntwo candles. Almost immediately after sitting down, we\nheard raps ; and the usual currents of cold air were\nfelt, also the vibration of the table and floor. We had\nvery little of rapping or movement of the table during\nthe seance. The table was, however, two or three times\nraised off the floor, and sustained in the air for a con-\nsiderable time. We were talking about a gentleman\n(a friend of the others) ;\nabusing him a little for being\nconceited and unpleasant in different ways. Home said,\n\" Oh, don't let us talk about our neighbours now.\"\nHowever, they went on talking about him, not in what\none would usually call an ill-natured way ; but still,\ncutting him up a little. The table was moving slightly\nall the time, and at last the alphabet was called for.\nThe four following sentences were spelled out, with short\nintervals between them :\n\" There is one God, He is the\nFather of all.'' \" God is tolerant\u2014he hears with our\nshortcomings.''' \"Love and charity\u2014God gives the one and\nexpects the other.\" \" We are all hut mortals.\" After\nsuch a beautiful rebuke as that, I need not say that we\ndid not talk any more about the shortcomings of our\nneighbours.\nI should say that Mr. Jencken had, soon after the\n\fNO. 8] With D. D. Home 67\nphenomena commenced, put out the candles. The fire-\nlight was, however, in a small room, quite sufficient to\nshow everything clearly. The name of God was, in every\ncase, marked in a manner different to that in which\nthe letters in the other words were indicated ; some-\ntimes by the table being raised and waved about. Once,\nwhen the table was in the air during the whole sen-\ntence, by slow strong vibrations, instead of raps. Home\nnow said he was touched for the accordion, and took it,\nholding it in the usual way. Almost immediately, without\nany apparent effort, it began' to play powerful, clear,\nand beautifully harmonious chords.\nIt played for some considerable time when the alphabet\nwas called for and this was spelled :\n\u2014\" You are quite\ncorrect, it tvas Augusta.\" I said, I did not see exactly to\nwhat the sentence applied. The alphabet was called\nagain, and the words \" The other night \" spelled, making\nthe sentence complete, and referring to what you and I\nhad been speaking of in the train about the message\non Saturday night, \" It was A touched the keys.''\nAfter this the accordion was again played for some\nlittle time most beautifully, the notes being drawn out\nso fine, that it was only by bending the head and listening\nattentively, that the harmony could be heard dying\naway and then swelling again. The accordion was drawn\nout from under the table, Home still holding it, lifted\nover his head, and brought round to Miss D R ;\nit was lifted up and presented towards her, the same\nwas done to me, and it was rested on my left shoulder,\nand while there, close to my ear, it breathed out the\nsoftest sounds. There was a noise as of someone breath-\ning behind me, which the others also heard, but, I think,\nthat must have been caused by the instrument. The\naccordion was in like manner presented to Mr. and\nMrs. Jencken, and then went under the table again.\nA very remarkable thing now occurred, the accordion\nwas seized by some influence that evidently could not\nplay it, and which disturbed that previously acting. It\nabruptly left off playing, then began again quite dif-\nferently, playing three or four notes with a powerful\n\f68 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nloud touch, and then it broke down altogether. Home,\nbefore the change said, \" Ah, there is some strange\ninfluence at work now.\" After the discordant notes,\nthe accordion was raised above the table. Home stiU\nholding it, he said his arm felt quite paralyzed, and\nthat he was obliged to follow it ; it drew him from his\nchair, and went near to D and remained there\nsome time oscillating backwards and forwards, and waving\nitself about, the accordion then led him back to his\nchair, after which it went under the table and re-\ncommenced playing as before the interruption. Soon\nthe alphabet was called, and the following spelt :\n\u2014\n\"We do all we can to sheiv you that we do not forget\"\u2014\n\u2022\nand then the accordion finished the sentence by playing\n\" Auld Lang Syne,\" first quietly, then with full loud\nchords. Home said suddenly, \" Oh, this is a very\npoAverful spirit.\" He stood up, or rather he was raised\nup, and his hand was violently agitated in the air ; he\nthen sat down, and his hand was extended towards the\nflowers on the small table, the fingers pointing towards\nthem. His hand remained there a few seconds, and was\nthen brought round, and with a motion like sprinkling,\ncast the perfume of the flowers towards each of us in\nturn ; the perfume was so strong that there could be\nno mistake about it. This was done twice. His hand\nwas then raised a little above my head, the fingers point-\ning towards me, and went through motions something\nlike mesmeric passes, or as I thought as though blessing\nme. His hand was then placed upon mine, and stroked\nmy fingers gently, first one then the other ; it then was\ncarried to his own face, and passed across it two or\nthree times. His hand was now swung violently to and\nfro, then remained quiet, and presently it was extended\nto the flowers again. I could distinctly see it with\nthe fingers pointing towards the flowers, about six inches\nabove them ; I am sure it never touched them. His\nhand became quite luminous, and was brought slowly\nround and across the table, until it remained with the\nflngers still extended, over my hand. I raised my hand\ntowards it, and a leaf of sweet-scented geranium fell\n\fNO. 8] With D. D. Home 69\napparently from under liis hand into mine, tlie leaf\nwas not held in his fingers, neither could I see it until\nit fell. (Home said, when his hand was extended over\nthe flowers, that it felt to him, as though it was resting\non a solid or semi-solid substance.) At the same moment,\nthe alphabet was called for and this spelled, \" Take it\nivith you, my hoy.'' This sentence followed immediately,\n\" We have done %vhat tve promised, look mider the hand-\nkerchief.\" Mrs. Jencken had, on the evening they had\nhad such beautiful manifestations, a short time ago,\nasked that a flower might also be given to her. They\nhad announced that it would be done, and now imder\nher handkerchief there was a piece of geranium ; her\nhandkerchief had been on the table all the time, and no\none had touched it.\nThis sentence was now spelled, \" Next for dear D .\"\nHome's hand was extended again to the flowers ; it\ncertainly was not nearer them than 6 inches ; it became\nluminous, and a flower was given to D in the same\nway it had been given to me. The alphabet was again\ncalled, and this spelled, \" This is for you,\" and at the\nsame moment, a flower dropped at Mr. Jencken's hand ;\nnone of us heard it broken off, or saw it, but it fell on\nthe table just in front of his hand. \" Our joy \" was now\nspelled, and the accordion played, and then \" Our thanks\nto God \" and it played again. The alphabet was called,\nand \" Weejj 7iot \" spelled. Dear old Mrs. Jencken was\nquietly crying, not as she said for sorrow, when the\nwords \" Weep not \" were spelled, her handkerchief was\ngently taken from her under the table, and afterwards\nreplaced upon it. After this, \" Good night \" was spelled,\nand nothing more occurred.\nV No. 9 Seance\u2014July 26th, 1868.\nPresent : Mrs. Jencken, Mrs. Hennings, Mr. Jencken,\nHome, and myself. Physical manifestations very slight.\nHome passing almost immediately into a trance, in which\nhe delivered the following address, purporting to come\n\f70 Experiences in Spirihialism [seance\nfrom the spirit of Dr. Jenckeu ; to prove identity several\ntests were given.\nDr. Jencken, during the last few years of his life,\nhad been quite blind, and was in the habit, when dictating,\nof going through the form of writing with great rapidity\non his knee with his finger ; he also had a peculiar\nhabit of clasping his hands together, and speaking with\nhis head bent very low down. Home imitated him in\nboth respects to the very life, and also mentioned some\ncircumstances that had occurred many years before at\nMayence.\nThe first words Home spoke were in a very low voice,\ntelling us to go on talking. He then got up, threw away\na silk cushion he had been sitting on, and said, \" Re-\nmember, Dan must not sit on a silk cushion while this\nvery hot weather lasts.\" He remained silent for a few\nminutes, and then commenced speaking with a clear voice,\nand in a very impressive manner. Part of the discourse\nwas in verse, but owing to the partially darkened state\nof the room and the rapidity of his utterance, it was\nquite impossible to write it down. The following notes\ntaken by Mr. Jencken are for these reasons very im-\nperfect.\n\" There are laws which govern the approach of spiritual\nbeings to earth, and their organic life, and there are\nepochs of darkness when the spiritual spheres are far\nremoved from the earth ; when the approach of spirits\nis all but impossible. These epochs have been called by\nthose on earth the dark ages ;\nthey mark the absence of\nspiritual intercourse. There are also times of near approach,\nnot unlike your winter and summer seasons. This alternate\naction is a great law ;\ngreat principles rule all things.\nThere was such an epoch of easy approach at the time\nof the Ancient Egyptians. They knew this and under-\nstood the laws better than you do. Before that time\nspirits had not taken sufficient pains to encourage the\ninvention of means for the perpetuating of knowledge.\nThere was no printing, nor mechanical contrivance, in\nthose days. Since then, during the period that their\napproach to earth was more difficult, they had turned\n\fNO. 9] With D. D. Home 71\ntheir attention more to those matters, so that now\nknowledge can never be so lost again. You are now entering\nupon a period of very near approach. It is coming like\nthe tide in a river\u2014irresistible, overriding the current,\novercoming all ; it is coming grandly and Godly. What has\nalready been seen is but the smallest wavelet of the\ntide that is coming upon the earth. Some of you here\npresent will see it ; others among you will have joined\nus, and will be helping on the great work we have in\nhand. The echoes of it are coming ;\nthey sound like\nthe notes of the organ rolling up the aisles of those\ngrand old cathedrals that men have built\u2014notes signifying\nthe heart-felt prayer of an earnest soul ascending to the\nthrone of God ; never lost but echoing on for ever.\nSpiritual truth must come ; truth is a lighthouse, a\nbeacon, a speck, a point, leading onward to realms of\nlove. We have no power, we can do so little, that we\noften wonder that we are able to do anything for you.\nLanguage is too imperfect, we cannot convey to you our\nmeaning ;\nyou cannot understand us ; our state is so\ndifferent from your material state, that it is with great\ndifficulty that we can work upon it to make our presence\nknown ; not that it is painful to us\u2014no, no, it is a\nlabour of love. But still it is an actual labour to us.\nThe earth is still so imperfect\u2014so undeveloped\u2014that we\nhave much difficulty in dealing with material objects.\nWhy, even such a little thing as the silk cushion that\nDan was sitting on, prevented us from making physical\nmanifestations to-night ;\nyet we did succeed in giving\nyou each a token of our presence, though it was very\nslight. Henry, the floor vibrated under your chair.\nAdare, your chair was touched. Amelia and Mary, you\nboth felt the current of cold air pass over your hands.\nYou aU felt something.\n\" The earth is as yet very immature, but progressing.\nA period of very near approach is at hand ; after that\nthere will be one, probably two epochs of darkness.\nWe are entirely dependent upon atmospherical conditions.\nNow, to-night, the atmosphere is so surcharged with\nelectricity, that it appears to us quite thick, like sand.\n\f72 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nIt is so unlike our own, that it is almost impossible\nfor us to get near you. We feel like men wading through\na quicksand\u2014slipping back as fast as we advance. At\nother times, when your earthly atmosphere is in a natural\nstate, it is more like our own, and we have no difficulty\nin being near you. You wonder if we wish you to be\nbetter than you are. You are all good. The germs of\ngood are in all. We can see further than you can ; and\nknow all your trials, all your doubts and difficulties.\nWere we not once mortals as you are ? We see the\ntroubles and the thorns that beset your path. Stretch\nforth your hands\u2014thrust them through the brambles\n\u2014\ndraw them not back or the blood will flow\u2014stretch them\nout and let them remain, there shall they find rest.\nWe know not of time ; to us, yesterday, to-day, to-morrow\nare all one. Had we hours, days, years, even ages, like\nyou, we should say time passes slowly, or time passes\nfast. We never tire ; we are eternity. Happiness is not\nidleness. Labour is joy, the labour of love. Even on earth\nit is not the spirit that wearies of a labour of love ;\nit is the\npoor weak body that tires, that faints, that falls to sleep.\nWe have work to do, to elevate ourselves, and to draw\nyou onward and upward. We constantly watch over you,\nand sympathize with all your cares. We never weary ;\nwe do not judge you ; we were as you are. God alone\nis the Judge. You ask why we always speak of love ;\nit is love that brings us to you. God is Love. Spirit\nmessages are ahvays breathing love for God. God is\nLove. ,. .\n\" Henry, your father is pleased that you are engaged\nupon his works, he too has his work to do. He was\naided in writing, and knows now that higher spirits\naided him. Do you remember at Mayence, how he was\naffected ? (Here Home imitated his peculiar mode of\nwriting upon his knee, and manner of speaking.) An\ninferior spirit had got influence over him. I see him now,\nhe had great self-esteem and was very opinionated, and\nonly wanted his own ideas to become prominent ; this is\nvery dangerous, and must be guarded against. Truth,\ntruth\u2014worship truth : particle by particle build up the\n\fNO. 9] With D. D. Home 73\ntemple of truth ; be consistent, fur Cod is Trutli. Here\nwe have no narrowing creed, no four church walls, with a\ncushioned pew for the rich, and a plain board for the poor\nman, to limit the worship of truth. The great four walls\nof eternity ; the blue ether, set with sparkling stars, gems\nmade by the hand of God, ever lustrous diamonds of\nthe heavenly orb, peep-holes of heaven ; it is there we\nworship, and through them we peer in our search for truth.\n\" One great objection made to Spiritualism, is, that we\ndo not disclose all the truth\u2014if true, why not tell all ?\nAre you capable of perceiving the truth ? The man\nhas not yet been formed upon the earth fitted to know\nthe whole truth. Immortality is before you ! Immor-\ntality gleams upon earth\u2014gleams like a lighthouse, like\na beacon to you. The future is not even understood\nby all of us,^ but we draw nearer and nearer to God,\nfor here there is no one to hold you back, to say\nyou are mad ;\npeals of angel voices call you onward and\nupward ; cheer you in your struggles, and aid you.\n\" There are great laws of development that draw the\norganic and the inorganic together ;\nyou on earth witness\nthe onward course of aU things in the organic world,\nrising to higher conditions, as, for instance, the develop-\nment of the child into manhood. Onward is the progress ;\nonward and upward. Search,\u2014search for truth,\u2014be true, be\nbrave, be prayerful ;\nye are all children of God created by Him.\nThe meaning is obscure. The words, '\"\nThe future is not even under-\nstood by all of us ; but we draw nearer and nearer to God, for here\nthere is no one to hold you back\u2014to say you are mad,\" evidently\nrefer to spirits, and the sentence should stand :\n\" For here there is no\none to hold trs back\u2014to say that we are mad.\" Substituting the words\n\" us \" and \" we \" for \" you,\" which is evidently improperly used. It is\nan open question whether the remaining lines belong to the same\nsentence or not ; the context would rather lead me to suppose not. If\nthe lines constitute one sentence with the same train of thought rimning\nall through it, then the word \"you\" should be altered to \"us\" in the\nlast two lines also, which should read thus :\n\" Peals of angel voices call\nus onward and upward ; cheer us in our struggles and aid us.\" But it\nappears to me more probable that the reference to the state of the spirits\nconcludes with the word \" mad, \"\nand that the remaining lines are an\naspiration or prayer that \"peals of angel voices may call you\" (that is,\nmortals) \"onward aiid upward ; cheer you in your struggles and aid you.\"\n\f74 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nThe time is rapidly coming for a great change in spiritual\nlife ; we are nearing the cycle, so near that some of you\nhere present will witness the change, others will have gone\nto their home, to their rest, to the blessed.

There\nwere nine present : Mr. and Mrs. Hall, Home, the Misses\nBertolacci (mediums), a cousin of mine, two gentlemen\nwhose first seance it was, and myself. Almost immediately\nwe felt the sort of phenomena that usually take place\nfirst, such as cold currents of air passing over the hands,\ntable vibrating, &c. These ceased, and for some time\nnothing occurred. Some one suggested that the young\nladies should try if anything would be written. They\ndid so with the planchette, both placing one hand upon\nit at the same time. These words were written, \" By\npatience, and in the name of Christ.\" We were also told\nby the same means to sit down again in the same positions\nwe had occupied before. After a time very strong mani-\nfestations took place, the table vibrating, tilting, and\nbeing raised about a foot off the ground ;\nraps were\nheard on the table, on the floor, on our chairs, &c.,\n\u2014\nnearly everyone was touched. I felt a hand between my\nleg and Home's : I was sitting next to him. There was\nevidently some very strong influence about Home. After\na time a message was given by raps :\n\" \/ now knoiv that\nmy Redeemer liveth : have patience and bear all. Daniel,\nI owe you many thanks.\u2014John Elliotson.\" After this, in\nanswer to some question (I forget what), the table was\ntilted three times in the four opposite directions, and was\n\fNO. 10] With D. D. Home 75\nthen lifted three times in the air. Home's chair was once\ndrawn away a little from the table, and raised off the\nfloor, but certainly not more than one inch. His chair\nwas also turned completely round, so that his back was\ntowards us, his feet during the whole time the chair\nwas moving being off the ground. An arm chair moved\nof itself a distance of about a yard up against the back\nof my chair. Home's hand and arm became cataleptic,\nand were moved about quite independent of his will.\nHis hand was sometimes thumped and beaten violently\nagainst the table, but without causing him any pain.\nHis hand was moved to the back of my neck, and\npushed me forward in my chair. He then began to thump\nme violently on the back, and to rub me across the back,\ncommencing at the right side. His hand also stroked and\npatted my head, and was also moved to my cousin\nsitting at the opposite side of the table, and stroked and\npatted her hands and head.\nThe following message was written by Home's hand,\nhis fingers being so strongly clenched, it was with dif-\nficulty that the pencil was inserted between them. \" We\nknow all your discussion about A W \u2022 ; we are\nthe best judges, it ivas a bad influence. F\u2014\u2014 and F .\"\nThe paper was then pushed across to my cousin to read,\nneither of us could understand what F and F\nmeant, although we ought to have guessed, as the same\nwords had been used about the same subject, in a message\ngiven us a few days previously. Seeing that we could not\nmake it out the words \"forget and forgive \" were written.\nOther messages were written through Home and one of\nthe ladies present. Mr. Holt, a gentleman whose first\nseance it was, became much affected ; soon after sitting\ndown, his hands Were taken possession of and violently\nagitated, sometimes on, and sometimes under the table ;\noccasionally his arms were drawn back behind his chair,\nhis hands being all the time violently agitated ; a pencil\nand paper were given him, but though his hand moved\nover the paper with the greatest rapidity, nothing but\nscribbling was the result. So strong was the influence\nover him, that he went and sat alone upon the sofa at some\n\f76 Experieyices in Spwih\/alism, [seance\ndistance from iis, to try and diminish it , wlien be left,\nthe power about the table became sensibly lessened ;\nhe continued to be slightly agitated the whole evening.\nWe were all anxious to know Avho was endeavouring to\nmake him write ; two Christian names with the word\n\" uncle \" between them were written through Home.\nHome at one time said he felt convinced that a spirit\nwas near him who had passed from this life by being\ndrowned. Some little time after, Mr. Hall was telling\nus how one of his brothers had been mysteriously drowned\nat sea, he being a very good swimmer ; Home's hand was\ntaken possession of and wrote the word \" Shark \" upon\na piece of paper, and then pushed it to Mr. Hall. Home\nand one of the ladies present went into a trance at the\nsame moment ; for some time they sat in their places,\noccupying themselves with putting their fingers upon the\nsheets of paper on the table, and then waving their\nhands about, the paper adhering to their fingers ; Home\nthen got up and walked about the room ; he took a\nlarge sheet of paper off the table, doubled it up and\nplaced it on the piano in the next room ; the young\nlady also got up, and sat down upon the sofa, at the\nother side of the room.\nHome sat down in his chair, and began to talk to\nMrs. Hall in a whisper. 1 could not hear the exact\nwords he used, but they were to the effect that during\ntheir occupation of that house, there had been a bad\ninfluence present during searices twice only. He mentioned\nwho one of the spirits was, and said that the same\ninfluence had that evening turned Home round in his\nchair, and had brought the arm chair up against mine.\nHe also told her that in the house to which they were\ngoing, nothing but what was good and holy would come\nnear them. Home was elongated to the extent of, I\nshould say, 6 inches, four times ; he walked about,\nstamped, and shuffled his feet, to shew that he was\nstanding fairly upon them. He went round to Mr. Holt,\none of the gentlemen present, and made him place his\nhand upon his waist that he might feel how he became\nelongated and contracted. Mr. Holt said that he held\n\fNO. 10] With D. D. Home 11\nhis hand flat against Home's side ; that the lower edge\nof his hand was resting on his hip bone ; that he felt\nHome's lower rib pass under his hand, until it was\nsome inches above it ; the whole flesh and muscle\napparently moving and stretching. On the contraction\ntaking place, he felt the lower rib come down until it\npressed against the upper edge of his hand and moved\ninto its proper position. Home said that the young\nlady had also been elongated, and would be again. She\nwas then standing near the table in a trance, and began\nswaying herself from side to side ; she was palpably\nelongated to the extent of, perhaps, three inches. About\nthis time a loud knock came at the outside door. Home\nsaid, \" He must come in\u2014it is the Master of Lindsay.\"\nHome then opened the room door, went out into the entry,\nand took the gentleman by the hand ; he led him into\nthe room ; made him shake hands with Mr. and Mrs.\nHall, with the young lady who was in the trance, and\nwith me, we being all perfect strangers to him. Home\nthen said to him, \" You must go out of the room until\nDaniel awakes, for if he was to awake and find you here,\nhe would be frightened.\" Shortly after this they both\nawoke, and the party broke up.\nI arrived at home about half an hour before Home.\nSoon after we had gone to bed we both heard the hall\ndoor loudly slammed. I said, \" Oh, Dan, you have left\nthe door open, and some one has come in !\n\" He declared\nhe had locked it, and put the chain up ;\nhowever, we\nboth got up and went down to see what was the matter.\nI found the hall door locked and the chain up, and the\nstudy and dining room doors both wide open. I went\ninto the study and heard raps, I then went out to where\nHome was standing in the entry, and we heard raps on\nthe floor. He said, \" Oh, I am sure it is dear old Dr.\nElliotson,\" \" Yes,\" was rapped. I then said, \" In that\ncase I suppose no burglars came in and we may go to\nbed again ?\n\" \" Yes,\" was rapped. We went up stairs.\nDr. Elliotson following us rapping on the banisters and\n\f78 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nstairs. After we had got into bed again we heard heavy\nfootsteps walldng about the room, and raps in various\nplaces. Home carried on a conversation with Dr. Elliot-\nson for a little time, asking questions and receiving\nanswers to them by raps.\nHe (Dr. EUiotson) told us that he had not suffered\npain in passing away, and that he had found the other\nworld very much what he had expected it to be ; that\nhe had not intended to frighten us by making a sound\nas of slamming the door, and that he would be more\ncareful not to make so much noise in future ; but that\nas yet he had only imperfect control over physical mani-\nfestations ; that he had followed Home to the house,\nand was glad to be near him, &c. Home and I talked\nabout him for some little time, he joining in our conversa-\ntion, assenting or dissenting by means of raps.\nTwo days after this as we were getting up, about\n10 o'clock, a bright sun shining into the room, loud\nraps came upon the floor, &c., and a long message of\na private character was given to Home.\nNo. 11 Seance\u2014July, 1868.\nHaving missed the last train to London I was very\nglad to accept Mr. Jones's kind offer to remain a]l night\nat his house. Home and I carried a sofa upstairs to his\n(Home's) room for me to sleep on. I did not leave the\nroom after bringing in the sofa. My clothes I placed\nupon a small round table near the foot of the bed.\nOn a chair by the sofa I placed a pocket handkerchief,\ntwo eye glasses, and a snuff box.\nDuring the seance in the evening it was said that I\nshould hear music without any instrument that night.\nHome turned off the gas previous to going to bed. A\ncertain amount of light entered the room from the street,\nso that it was not perfectly dark. I could easily distin-\nguish Home when he sat up in bed ; and could have\nseen anybody moving about the room.\n\fNO. 11] With D. D. Home 79\nWe had not been in bed more than three minutes\nwhen both Home and myself simultaneously heard the\nmusic ; it sounded like a harmonium ;\nsometimes, as if\nplayed loudly at a great distance ; at other times, as if\nvery gently, close by. The music continued for some\nminutes, when Home got up to ask Mr. Jones if any one\nwas playing the accordion. Mr. Jones returned with him,\nand we all three then heard the music. The usual\nphenomena of rajDS and vibrations of the floor, sofa,\n&c., occurred very frequently and with great power ;\nthe raps sounded all over the room ; on the floor, walls,\neven on Home's bed ;\non, under, and in my sofa. My\nsofa occasionally vibrated very strongly ; the bed clothes\non Home's bed and on the sofa were frequently pulled\nand moved about. We both several times heard sounds\nsuch as would be caused by some one in a muslin dress\nmoving about the room, although we could see nothing.\nAfter a short time I heard the chair close to my sofa\nmoving, and a finger touched one of my hands that was\nhanging over the side of the sofa, the next moment I\nfelt the snuff box on the chair touch me, and found\nthat the chair was moving, I said that I thought some\none had touched me, but that probably I had been mis-\ntaken, and that it was only the box ; the spirits said by\nthe alphabet that I had been touched. The chair then\nmoved to the foot of the bed, and we heard the various\narticles upon it being stirred about. I was sitting upon\nthe sofa, with one hand resting on the edge, suddenly\nI felt something brush across my hand ; this was repeated,\nand I became aware of something swinging in the air.\nI then heard some object brushing backwards and for-\nwards against the back of the sofa, inside ; on putting\nmy hand to the spot, my eye glass was placed in it.\nI took the glass, and in drawing it away I felt, by the\nresistance offered, that the cord was attached to some-\nthing ; while feeling the resistance a hand and arm\nholding the end of the cord became visible. This I saw\ndistinctly for a second or two, it then disappeared.\nI now heard a sound near the foot of the bed as if\nmy double glasses were being opened and shut, and I\n\f80 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\ndistinctly saw a figure, apparently draped, standing over\nthe foot of the bed ; it held something, I believe the\ndouble glasses, and I could see the hand and arm waving\nbackwards and forwards ; I could hear the eye-glass\nswinging in the air, but could not see it ; the figure\nstooped down towards Mr. Jones, and disappeared. A\nmessage was then given :\n\" The figure is not the same as\nthe one that touched you.\"\nAbout half a minute after, I distinctly heard something\nmoving along the side of the sofa, and immediately my\ndouble eye-glass was placed upon the back of my hand ;\nI felt the hand that held it push it on, and then stroke\nand pat my fingers ; I took three fingers of the hand in\nmine, and held them for some seconds ; as I increased the\npressure upon them, they appeared to withdraw them-\nselves from me ; I was again touched, and my hand\nstroked and patted, the fingers were like a delicately\nformed human hand, the skin feeling perfectly natural to\nthe touch.\nA message was now given : \"We place it there to shew\nyou that we do not tvish you to contract a habit, pernicious,\nand that can he of no possible use to you.\" While wondering\nwhat this could mean, my snuff box came right across\nthe room through the air, falling against my leg, where it\nremained. Home saw it pass through the air in front of\nhim. I asked who had thrown it ; and was told \" Grand-\nfather Goold.\" Mr. Jones asked if the snuff had been\ntaken out, \" No,\" was immediately rapped in various\nparts of the room.\nMr. Jones wished that something might be done for\nhim, and he was slightly touched. He asked also that the\nchair might be moved round to him. The chair began\nagain to move, but there was not room for it to pass\nbetween the foot of the bed and the round table. The\ntable was raised off the floor and moved out of the way,\nthe top becoming slightly luminous. While moving, it\nsuddenly fell to the floor and rolled over. My clothes\ntumbled off, the money in the pockets rolling about the\nroom. I said, \" I wonder how it happened ;\nit is so unusual\nfor them to let anything fall.\" They answered, \" It\n\fNO. 11] With D. D. Home 81\nhappened by 7nistake.\" I observed, \" How kind it is of them\nto answer questions like this.\" They answered, \" Would\nyou not do the same for us.'' Mr. Jones said that he\nsupposed the spirits in the room were friends of mine.\nThey answered \" YesJ' I asked how many of my own\nfamily were present. They answered \" Six.\" I asked if\nthey had not come to welcome me home from abroad.\nThey answered \" Yes,\" by rapping three times all over\nthe room.\nA message was now given :\n\" We ivish to give you\nthe .\" Here it broke off ;\nand though Home re-\npeated the alphabet three or four times, nothing more\nwould come. While we were wondering at this unfinished\nsentence my pocket handkerchief dropped through the air\ninto my lap. I took it up and found there was something\nhard in it. It turned out to be my latch key that I\nhad left in my trowsers pocket, knotted into one corner\nof the handkerchief. The remainder of tlie unfinished\nmessage was then spelled out :\n\" Key to the mystery,\" making\naltogether, \"We ivish to give you the key to the mystery.\"\nMr. Jones had been telling me that the spirits were\nanxious to prove to me that there was an actual intel-\nligence at work, and that the phenomena were not the\nresult of mere animal magnetism.\nAfter this, \" Good night \" was spelled out. The last\nsound I heard was that of the jingling of the money\nwhile being picked up about the room. I put my eye-\nglass, handkerchief, and snuff-box on the floor. Mr. Jones\nleft the room, and I very soon went to sleep. In the\nmorning I found the things on the floor in the same\nposition that I had left them in, the key being still\nknotted to the handkerchief. The chair was near the\nfoot of the bed, a blanket that I had thrown off my\nsofa entangled round it. The table was lying on the\nground\u2014my clothes on the floor. All my silver I found in\nthe pocket I had left it in ; the gold, consisting of four\npieces, I found on Home's counterpane.\nThese phenomena could not have been caused by any\nmechanical contrivances. In order to produce the violent\nvibrations and the raps on the sofa, it would have been\nF\n\f82 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nnecessary to attach some complicated machinery to it ;\nthat was impossible, as I assisted to carry it up from the\ndrawing room, never left the room after we had brought it up,\nand was lying down upon it within three or four minutes\nafter we had placed it in the room. It would have been also\nnecessary to attach machinery to the chair and table.\nArticles were taken from the chair, and conveyed to me\nwithout any human agency, for I must have seen anyone\nmoving in the room, and the chair was too far removed\nfrom Mr. Jones and Home to have been reached by them\nby any means.\nNo. 12 Seance\u20145, Buckingham Gate, August Srd, 1868.\nOne day last week Home complained of not feeling at\nall well, and of being in very low spirits. I did not feel\nwell myself, and lay down on the sofa, where I presently\nwent to sleep. When I awoke, Home told me that there\nhad been raps on the tables, &c., but that instead of\ncheering him they made him feel more uncomfortable.\nThey had given him answers to several questions. He\nasked why it was that he felt so low and ill. The answer\nwas, \" There is nothing Spiritualistic in it ; it is rather\na tinge from the thoughts of Adare.'' This puzzled me very\nmuch, as I was quite unaware of anything having\ntaken place that could give rise to unpleasant thoughts.\nI sat down at the writing table and heard raps on various\nparts of it. They again said that they showed their\npresence to \" cheer Dan.\" Home had said that he felt\na desire to smoke a cigarette, a thing I have never known\nhim do before. He smoked one, owing to which, I think,\na fit of coughing was brought on. Home coughed up a\nquantity of blood and seemed relieved by it ; he then\nlay down on the sofa. The raps continued for a short\ntime, and I asked if Home's indisposition was anything\nserious. They answered, \" No.\" I asked if he would be\nall right soon. They answered, \" Yes.\" This occurred\nabout 3 p.m. in broad daylight.\n\fNO. 13] With D. D. Home 83\nNo. 13 Seance\u20145, Buckingham Gate.\nTwo or three days subsequently, Home and I having\ngone to bed after a seance here, at which we felt a few\nmovements of the table, we had manifestations in the bed\nroom, consisting of our beds vibrating strongly and of\nraps on the furniture, doors, and all about the room.\nHome's bed was slightly moved out from the wall. We both\nheard something on the dressing table being moved about,\nand at the same moment we both saw in exactly the same spot,\na perfectly white column, it can scarcely be called a figure,\nas the shape was indistinct. It moved from the dressing\ntable towards Home's bed. Home said he saw a white\nobject about the size of a child floating near the ceiling\nabove his head. I saw it also, but it appeared to me to\nbe in mid air, half way between the bed and the ceiling :\nit was floating about in a horizontal position ; it was like\na small white cloud without any well-defined shape. I\nsaw it descend close to Home, who then lost sight of it,\nbut I perceived it come within about two feet of his head.\nIt then slowly floated to the foot of his bed and dis-\nappeared. I afterwards saw the same appearance near the\ndoor. Home saw it intercept the light coming in from the\nwindow against the opposite wall ; I did not. We had\nthree messages given us : First, \" We love God best by\nloving you and seeking to influence you for good.'' Second,\n\" Seeing that you have been troubled to knoiv what we\nmeant by its being rather a tinge from the thoughts of Adare,\nwe wish to tell you it was oiving to something in a letter\nreceived from his father.\" The manifestations continued for\nsome time when the third message was given :\n\" Noio\nsleep.\" After this we heard and saw nothing more.\nThere was sufficient light in the room to distinguish\ncandles, books, &c., on the table.\nNo. 14 Seance\u2014August 6th, 1868.\nPresent : Mrs. Jencken, Mrs. Hennings, Mr. Jencken,\nHome, and mj^self.

Those that are longer away from\nearth lose their intense interest in it, they have other\ncalls upon them. He, like your father, sought for develop-\nment and truth, though often wrongly guided ; he did\nnot look up to the great sunhght, but doubted and erred.\nThese two have, as I said, met to-day, just now, according\nto your mode of computing time. Dr. ElUotson is so\ndelighted to meet your father. '\nWhy have we not met\nbefore ?\n'\nhe says, '\nwe ought.' '\nThat was your fault.\nDr. Elliotson ; not mine.' Then he turns back, shakes\nyour father by the hand and tells him he is so glad to\nknow him. In the state that we live in there are no\nrestrictions ; men are drawn together by mutual sym-\npathies.

The same thing has\noccurred to myself. In my case, my hands were moved about some-\ntimes violently, sometimes gently, without any act of volition on my\npart ; and yet in a manner not entirely beyond my control. In Mr.\nHome's case the muscles became perfectly hard and rigid ; and I fancy\nhe can neither direct nor prevent the movements.\n\" The following account of what occurred during Home's trance is\ncompiled from the notes taken by Mr. Jencken.\n\fNO. 14] With D.

He said, \" It's very\nwrong to allow persons to marry who are not properly\nfitted to perpetuate their race. By allowing perfect\nfreedom of marriage, crime and disease become perpetuated,\nand the lower and imperfect form becomes too permanent.\nSuch as are imperfect should be put aside, cared for,\npitied, but not allowed to perpetuate by marriage.

After a\nminute he fell back in his chair, then started up and\ntaking Mrs. Hennings' hands said (Dr. Elhotson speaking\nthrough him), \" They tell me I have been too violent with\nDan, but my dear lady, I must just tell you this.

On the following morning I\ngot a letter from Home, saying that she had been to\nvisit him, that she appeared very restless, and that she\nwas very anxious to come when he and I were together.\nOn returning to London, Home, at my request, came to\nstay at No. 5. All the evening he complained of being-\nvery nervous and in an unpleasant state, which he\nattributed a great deal to her influence. I felt just the\nsame, but put it down to having been out at two fires\nand not home till six o'clock the previous morning.\nAlmost immediately after we had gone to bed and put\nthe hghts out, we both heard music much the same as at\nNorwood but more powerful and distinct. Home said that\nthe music formed words ;\nthat, in fact, it was a voice\nspeaking and not instrumental music. I could hear nothing\nbut the chords hke an organ or harmonium played at a\ndistance. Home became quite excited because I could not\ndistinguish the words, thinking that if I could not hear\nthem, it must have been his imagination. He asked the\nspirits if possible to make the words sufficiently clear for\nme also to hear them. They said \" Yes \" (by raps) ;\nand the music became louder and louder until I dis-\ntinctly heard the words, \" Hallelujah, praise the Lord ;\npraise the Lord God Almight3^\" It was no imagination,\nor the result of anxiety on my part to hear the same as\nHome did. Every now and then I could not distinguish\nwords, although he said he could ; but I repeatedly heard\n\f92 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nthe words above mentioned as plainly as possible. I cannot\nin the least explain to you how the voice articulated ;\nthe words were not separately spoken, neither did it\nresemble a human voice. The sound was slightly reedy\nand metallic, not very unhke the Vox humana on an\norgan. If you can imagine an organ pipe of some rather\nreedy stop speaking to you, it will be as near it as\nanything I can describe. Home said he heard the words,\n\" Adah Isaaks Menken \" pronounced ; I did not. The\nmusic or voice gradually died away. We asked if it was\nMenken's voice, and they said not hers alone. There\nwere loud raps at different times upon the floor and walls,\nand some article of furniture was moved : I heard the\nmovement, but could not see what it was.\nThe room was dark, the bhnd being nearly down over\nthe window. We both saw as it were a luminous claud\nabout the middle of the room over the table, and another\nluminous cloud-like body floating in the air. Occasionally,\nI saw a luminous form standing at the foot of Home's\nbed which he did not see, and he at one time saw a\nsimilar appearance at the foot of mine which I failed to\nperceive ; we distinctly heard the rustUng of a silk dress\nmoving about the room. Home and I had called on\nMenken at her hotel one day last year, and she then had\non a very heavy silk dress, it appeared as though she\ncaused the rustling of this dress to be heard by us. At\none time I heard some one moving, and looking over on\ntowards Home's bed, I saw her quite plain (as did also\nHome) as a white slightly luminous body, I could clearly\nsee the folds of the drapery. In passing between him and\nthe window Home said she obstructed the light. She\nmoved up from near the foot of his bed where I first\nsaw her, making as loud a rusthng noise as a living\nwoman in a heavy silk dress would do, to the head of\nhis bed, bent over, put her hands upon his head, and\ndisappeared.\nPresently Home said that she was slightly taking\npossession of him, and I heard his hands moving about\non the bed clothes in the curious way that they do under\nthose circumstances. He then sat up in bed involuntarily.\n\fKO. 15] With D. D. Home 93\nand said she was taking possession of hira, and asked\nme not to be frightened at anything he might do.\nI felt rather nervous at this ; and asked him, if\npossible, to tell me before he did anything. He said\nnothing, but lay down in bed again. In about a minute,\nhe said in quite an altered voice, \" I am coming over to\nyou now,\" and I saw him get out of bed. I did not feel\nsure whether he was asleep or awake, and I said, \" Can\nyou see your way ?\n\" He said, \" Ah, I want no hght to\nguide my steps.\" I then perceived that he was in a\ntrance, and that Menken was speaking through him. He\nwalked slowly over to my bed, knelt down beside it,\ntook both my hands in his, and began speaking.\nI shall never forget the awfully thrilhng way in which\nshe spoke ; the desolation of the picture she drew of her\nfeeUngs at first. The words I do not recollect\u2014the effect\nof them I shall always remember. She went on to speak\nof the wonderful mercy and goodness of God ; of the\nhopeful state she was then in ; of the very little we know\nof the next world, sapng that she had thought she knew\nsomething of it. She spoke a great deal about Home, of\nhis character, &c.,_ &c., and a good deal about herself,\nand mentioned a curious fact. She said that at the time\nHome and I called upon her together, she felt then what\nshe was. \" Yes,\" she said, \" what was I but an animal ?\nYet I felt and knew that I ought to aspire to higher\nthings, and I longed sometimes for it.\" It appears as if our\nhaving called together upon her, had some curious effect,\nas she said she could not well say what she wanted, till\nwe were together again. She spoke of the intense desire\nof the spirit sometimes to communicate with, and do\ngood to, those on earth. She spoke in such an humble\nyet happy manner, of her having been permitted to come\nthat night into a house where so many pure and holy\nbeings had been. She spoke with the greatest pleasure\nof having been allowed to go into my mother's boudoir,\nand said that her greatest happiness, since she passed\naway, had been that evening\u2014in being permitted to make\nher voice audible to iis in praising God. She went on to\nsay, how much she wished to be sometimes near me and\n\f94 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nnear Home to watch over us ; and assured me again\nand again that she would do me no harm or hurt. She\nthen kissed my hand and said, \" I must go now ; I\nmust not make too much use of Dan.\" Home then got\nup and walked slowly away, turning round twice, and\nraising his hands above his head in an attitude of prayer\nor of blessing. As he went away from me, his clothes\nbecame slightly luminous.\nHe got into bed and I could hear him breathing\nregularly as in ordinary sleep ; in about five minutes he\nawoke and asked me if I was asleep, he said he had been\nasleep and wanted to know whether we had been hearing\nbeautiful music, or whether we had been dreaming. I\ntold him nothing about his having been in a trance\nuntd next day. Home said he felt remarkably happy and\ncalm,\u2014probably some reflection of the more calm and\nsoothed condition of Menken when she left ns. I was in\na queer state, my fingers and feet tingled as if I had\npins and needles. Every time I dropped off to sleep I\nheard, or fancied I heard, the same strains of music.\nHowever I slept very soundly.\nNow all this is to me far more wonderful than what\ntook place at Norwood. I was, to all intents and pur-\nposes, actually conversing ^vith the dead ;\nlistening,\ntalking, answering, and receiving answers from Menken.\nHome's individuality was quite gone : he spoke as Menken,\nand we both spoke of him as a third person at a distance\nfrom us. Menken said something (what I cannot remember)\nabout her having been a Jewess, and that events were\ntending gradually towards a greater unity of different\ncreeds.\nNo. 16 Seance\u2014Homhurg, August, 1868.\nAt Cologne we slept in a double-bedded room. As\nHome was going to sleep, he said, \" How odd.\" I asked\nhim what he meant ; and he said he had heard Menken's\nvoice say, \" That is right, Dan,\" in reference to an\nobservation he had just made to me. She also told him\n\fNO. 16] With D. D. Home 95\nthat she was with us that morning when we were talking\nabout the probabihty of dogs being able to understand\neach other ; that they could communicate with each\nother by magnetism, by touch, and through the eye ;\nbut not at all by sound. She added that she was going\nwith us. and that we should hear her voice.\nAt Frankfort, Home came into my room in the morn-\ning ; and on my asking him some question as to how he\nhad passed the night, said that after he had gone to\nbed he heard Menken's voice say that his sheets were\ndamp, that he had found that they were so, and had\nslept in a railway rug.\nOn Thursday night, at Homburg, we both heard strange\nraps about the room. I then felt and heard Uttle gentle\ntaps upon the foot of my bed, by which I recognized\nthe presence of my mother. I asked if it was so, and\nwas answered \" Yes.\" I said to Home that I was glad\nmy mother was there, because I thought that she had\nnot been near me for some time. This message came :\n\" Yoii must at times he aUoived foreign influences ; hut\nI do not leave you\u2014\/ love yoxi too much for that.''' We\nwere taUdng about this sentence ; and Home was saying\nit was unselfishness that induced my mother to give way\nto other spirits sometimes, who were very anxious to\ncommunicate, w^hen this message was given :\n\" The love\nof our great Creator is unselfish.'' We then began specu-\nlating as to whether there was a continual contest going\non in the next world between good and bad, and I was\nanswered by a message sajdng that \" there is a contest\nthe same as on earth.'' I made some remark that on\nearth it was a great deal a matter of physical force,\nand that a good weak man could not turn a bad strong\none out of his house, when this message was given :\n\" Purity, when freed from the mortal, is strongest, as truth\novercomes error.\" Home presently said, \" There is a\nspirit standing in the corner, can you not see it ? I\ncan see it as a faint light increasing and decreasing in\nbrightness.\" I looked, but could not make it out ; but\nI saw a faint light on the other side of the room, and\ncalled Home's attention to it. As we looked in that\n\f96 Experiences in S'lnritualitsm [seance\ndirection, the light in the corner shone out suddenly,\nlike a flash of lightning. It was an instantaneous per-\nfectly bright flash of light, lasting perhaps nearly a\nsecond.\nNo. 17. Seance.\nOn the 30th of August we had a seance at Mrs. Hamil-\nton's.

My\nhands were a good deal agitated ; I felt the cold air\nvery plainly. Home's hands were taken possession of,\nand he was caused to get up. He went behind Mrs.\nHamilton and began tapping her very rapidly with both\nhands on the ears and back ; while doing so, he went\ninto a trance. He continued to tap her ears and to\nmake passes over her. He then walked up and down the\nroom, leaning his head upon his hand as though thinking\ndeeply, and making gestures quite strange to him in his\nnatural state. He went behind Lady Fairfax, stooped\ndown, and holding her shoulders with both hands pressed\nhis head against her back. He then stood behind her,\npressed his hand to his side on the region of the liver,\nand looked as though he was suffering great pain or\ninconvenience ; he then opened the door and went into\nthe other room. From there he said, \" Mary (Miss\nHamilton) and Adare, come in here.\" We went in and\nfoxmd Home on the sofa, leaning his head upon his\nhand. He said, \" Adare, take a pencil and paper.\" I\ndid so, and wrote down what he said. Home said,\n\" Mary, the drum of your mother's ear is surrounded by\nwax ; the nerve is not paralyzed. Take some plain\nsweet oil in a phial, place it in hot water until the oil\nis warm, and drop one drop into the ear every night.\nAfter some time a discharge will take place, that is, the\nwax will become softened and come away.

We sat down again, and he placed himself\nin exactly the same position behind Mrs. Hamilton as\nhe had occupied when he became entranced. He then\nawoke and said, \"Is it not funny, all the power has\nleft my hands !\n\" and sat down. We then had some\nphysical manifestations ; the table was moved, tilted,\nand raised oli the ground ;\nmy chair was a httle moved,\nas was also Home's. \" Good night \" was then said.\nWhile he was in the trance, some one asked whether he\ncould see.

I asked, should he mesmerise me and\nsend me to sleep, they said, \" No.\" They then said,\n\" We have already calmed you,\" which was the case.\nHome then went into a trance ; he got up and came\nover to me and sat down on my bed ; he sat for some\nhttle time holding one of my hands in his and pressing\nthe other against my heart. I felt very calm and quiet ;\nhe then joined his hands in prayer and began praying,\nbut I could not hear the words. I said, more to myself\nthan him, \" I will unite my prayer to yours.\" He took\nmy two hands, joined them within his and we prayed\ntogether ;\nsomething affected me so much that I burst\nout crying, and the tears ran down my cheeks. After\na minute or two, he passed his hand across my throat,\nand stopped the crying immediately ; he than made\npasses over my head and down my side, took my hand\nand kissed it, kissed my forehead and said, \" Good\nnight ;\nsleep, sleep\u2014when you fall asleep you will not\nawake.\" He then got quietly into bed again ; in about\nhalf a minute the clock (a very noisy disagreeable one)\nstruck eleven. He got out of bed and went into the\nnext room where he awoke and nearly fell down ; he\nwas so much astonished at finding himself standing\nopposite the clock. The clock stopped at that moment.\n\f100 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nthough I do not believe he had touched it ; in fact he\ncould not have reached it without getting on a chair.\nIn a short time I fell into a sound sleep.\nThe next morning Home gave me two louis to play for\na medalhon for the moth ; I went in at a quarter-past\ntwelve and put one on red\u2014red won ; I then put the\nother also on red\u2014red won again ;\nmaking therefore\nsix louis. Something seemed to say to me six is enough,\nand I put out my hand to the rake to take the money ;\nhowever, when I had my hand almost on the rake,\nI felt a disinclination to take it. I allowed the money to\nremain on red, and so lost. I left the table to look for\nHome to tell him the money was gone ; when half way\ndown the corridor I involuntarily stopped, turned round,\nand walked back again. Something seemed to say, you\nmust use two louis of your own, and take them back\nafterwards. I did so, and won a small sum. I took\nback my two louis and handed the remainder to Home.\nNo. 19 Seance.\nOn Friday, the 4th [September, 1868], we had some\nraps in the room, and a spirit said, \" Are you good ?\n\"\nWe both thought, but could not discover that we had\ndone anything particularly wrong that day. I asked,\n\" Is the question for me 1\n\" No answer. \" Or for Dan ?\n\"\nNo answer. \" Or for both ?\n\" No answer. I said, \" Is\nit not for me ?\n\" Two raps came, meaning \" Partly,\" or\n\"Perhaps.\" After a pause, they said, \"We do not wish\nto reproach you, but at the close of the day it is always\nwell to review all that you have dmie, so as to be able to\navoid rep)eating the same things, if wrong, another day.\"\nThe same night we both saw a luminous hand waving in\nthe air at the foot of Home's bed.\nOn Saturday, the 5th [September, 1868], Home was not\nwell, and a certain circumstance annoyed him. In the\n\fNO. 19] With D. D. Home 101\nevening, I took him up rather sharply about it ;\ntelling\nhim it was absurd letting liis imagination run wild, and\nsupposing all sorts of nonsense. At night Home was\nvery ill ; it was about eleven o'clock, I was undi'essing,\nhe was in bed. Count Ronicker came in and sat down.\nHome became cataleptic or something having that appear-\nance ; his fingers were turned back, his arms and his neck\ntwisted round, and his whole body became as rigid as\niron\u2014^for about five minutes he did not appear to breathe.\nCount Ronicker magnetized him, and did him a great\ndeal of good. Home completely forgot English, and said\nhe could only speak Russian to the Count. He spoke\nabout me, but I do not know what he said.\nAfter a time he got better, and went into a trance\nand spoke Enghsh ; but so low that I could scarcely\nhear. I asked him to speak louder, he said, \" We cannot\n\u2014oh, do try to hear, we cannot keep Dan long in\na trance as we would wish, he is so ill.\" He said, \" When\nDan told you to-day that he felt a disagreeable influence,\nas it were, trying to separate you, he did not tell you\nall ; he ought to have done so ;\nyou were too sharp\nwith him ;\nyou were too hard upon him also about\nplaying ; remember he is very differently situated to you ;\nremember always that his nature is very sensitive, very\ndifferent from yours. You must arrange your worldly\naffairs together.\" He then sat up in bed, and began to\ntalk in French, still in a trance ; he smiled and beckoned\nto some one at the other side of the room. \" Ah,\" he\nsaid, \" there is such a sweet gentle spirit here ; 1 will\ntell you her name directly.\" He described her, and said\nshe had most beautiful eyes ; that when she smiled, she\nsmiled with her eyes also. He described the colour of\nher hair, eyes, &c., minutely. \" There is a httle child\nwith her\u2014ah, there are two ! One passed away at its\nbirth ; the other is older.\" He than shuddered and\nsaid, \" There is a spirit here who committed suicide.\nOh!\" he said, and began making passes before him,\nand drawing himself back as i\u00a3 in horror. Soon he went\non in French, and said, \" Daniel is very ill : his brain\nis very bad ; the influence about him is mixed to-night.\n\f102 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nAt four in the afternoon lie began to be ill, and his\nfriend did not talk to him or understand it, and after-\nwards his friend was a little cold and hard upon him ;\nhe has also undergone a very great trial lately, we cannot\ncure him of the effects at once. We tell you that you\nmay understand the state he is in.\" He then lay down,\nand said to the Count, \" It was Sophy who made the\nraps on the wall of your room last night. She is your\nguardian spirit, and is always about you and caring\nfor you.\" The Count asked \" Which Sophy ?\n\" He said,\n\" Both the younger and the elder.\" After a minute he\nsat up again, turned to the Count, and said, \" Where\nthen was your faith when you prayed to God on your\nknees for death ? Where was your faith ?\n\u2014you should\nthen rather have wished to live.\" He talked for some\nlittle time in French to the Count, and told him some\nfacts which he (the Count) swore positively to me could\nbe known only to himself and the spirit that Home had\nbeen describing ; he then said, \" When Daniel awakes we\nwill try and make some manifestations for you ; but\nDaniel is so ill we cannot do much. You will take a\nchair ; but not too near Daniel, your influence is too\nstrong. Adare will put the candle out.\" After he awoke\nI put the candle out, and we heard distinct raps on the\nfloor, walls, door, &c., and the Count felt his head touched.\nThe Count then went away. Soon after he had gone,\nthe same spirit that had told us the night before to\nreview our actions said, through the alphabet, \" How\nabout' to-day ? Soon after, he said, Are you happy?'\"\nI then heard that Home was getting some message\n;\nbut I do not know what it was. I heard him say,\n\" I cannot do it\u2014oh ! please don't ;\nyou know I am so\nill ?\n\" Directly after he turned his head round towards\nme, and said that when he had told me he felt an un-\npleasant influence as though trying to separate us, he had\nnot told me all, and he went on to explain about a\nvery extraordinary case of second sight that had occurred\nto him that day.\nAfter he had done so, he said that he felt quite com-\nfortable and happy. We talked for some time about\n\fNO. 19] With D. D. Home 103\nsecond sight, and he was explaining how one could tell\nby the appearance of his eyes when it was lil^ely to occur\nto him. Suddenly he said to me, \" I am in the Kursaal,\nin the playing room ; I will tell you what I see.\" All\nthe time he talked quite naturally, and knew that he\nwas in bed ; at the same time he declared he was actually\nstanding on the floor of the room, and could observe all\nthat was going on there. \" Oh !\n\" he said, \" it is horrible !\nOh, it is dreadful ! My God, it is so horrible that, if\nit lasts long, I can never go into that room again ! I\nsee the table, and I see crowds of hands all about it,\nflying about all over it,\n\u2014young hands, old hands,\u2014hands\nof men and women,\u2014they are dashing about over the\ntable, sometimes catching hold of each other, and then\nthrowing each other off. Oh, there is a hand with blood\nupon it ! There is an old man's hand, and a woman's\nhand that seizes his, but he dashes hers away from him !\nOh, it is too terrible It is changed now. I will tell\nyou what I see directly. There are a number of young\npeople sitting round the table, all young, pretty and\npleasant looking ;\nnearly all of them are women ;\nthey\nare playing, but laughing, talking and thinking of other\nthings also, not intent upon the game ; the others are\nall driven back from the table ;\nthey are in a varied\nconfused sort of crowd, there is a regular sohd barrier\nthat I can see before them. Some are leaning over\nand trying to get across, but they cannot ; now the\ntable is covered with roses : I see that they are playing\nwith roses. A sort of leader among them, a woman, is\ngetting up and says, '\nWell, I suppose we must take away\nthese lovely roses with us ; it is a pity, but if these\nj)oor people prefer money to them, why we must take\nthem away.' Now it has again changed. The table is\ncovered with httle children, they are sitting on the table,\nand most of them look thoughtful ;\nthey are such pretty,\nsweet little children. The crowd is still kej)t back by the\nbarrier, but some of them look as if they wanted to\ncaress the children. There is one man who is stretching-\nout his hands so eagerly towards such a rosy, pretty\nlittle fellow, and wants to shake hands with him, but the\n\f104 Ex2}eriences in Spiritualism [seance\nchild is saying, '\nI cannot shake your hand, because we\nhave all just been washed and dressed, and your hands are\nso dirty from the money that I must not touch them.'\n\"\nAfter this he saw nothing more and went to sleep, and\nawoke the next day wonderfully well, considering how\nill he had been.\nOn Sunday, the 6th [SejDtember, 1868], we had a seance\nat Mrs. Hamilton's. There was a strong influence ; there\nwere raps on the table, chairs, &c. ; our chairs were\nviolently vibrated ; Home's chair moved, and there were\nno messages. The table was tilted, not lifted. Count\nRonicker was present, and his magnetic influence was so\nstrong that it made us all more or less ill, and I think\nstopped the seance.\nNo. 20 Seance\u2014Friday, the 11th [September, 1868].\nLast Wednesday night, soon after the lights were put\nout, a spirit asked if our actions during the day had been\nas they should be ? Soon after, he said, \" The atmo-\nsphere of this house is not good for either of you ; it is\nvery damp.'\" I said, \" Is that the reason I always awake\nin the morning with a sore throat 1\n\" The spirit rephed,\n\" Yes.'' We asked where we should go ; the answer\nwas, \" The Hesse is the highest.'' We accordingly moved\n'into the Hotel de Hesse. The house in which we lodged\nwas, as the spirit said, in a very low and damp situation.\nNo. 21 Seance\u2014Sunday, 13th [September, 1868].\nLast Friday, we had a seance at Mrs. Hamilton's.\nPresent : Mr., Mrs., and Miss Hamilton, the Baron de\nVeh and his wife, the Princess Karoh, Mrs. Watkins,\nMrs. Gregory, the Count de Mons, General Brevern,\nHome, and myself. We had physical manifestations,\ncurrents of cold air, vibration of our chairs and the table,\ntable-tilting, &c. Home's chair was moved shghtly ;\nMrs. Watkins, who was sitting near him, was moved also.\n\fNO. 21] With D. D. Home 105\nMi's. Watkins had suffered severely from rheumatism,\nand was quite bent double by it. Home's hands were\ntaken possession of, and he was moved to get up. He\nplaced himself behind her chair and began tapping her\non the back and grasping her shoulders ; he then sat\ndown and presently went into a trance. We recognized\nby his manner the same spirit that had prescribed for\nMrs. Hamilton, and Lady Fairfax, and myself, on a\nprevious occasion. He walked up and down the room\ntwo or three times ; then placed his head against Mrs.\nWatkins's back, and held it firmly there for a minute or\ntwo. He then walked into the next room ; beckoned to\nme and made a sign as of writing. I got a pencil and\npaper, and went in. He was sitting down, and said,\n\" We wish you to have a compress made\u2014a sort of\nplaster of tar spread upon a cloth, and covered with\nmuslin, to be placed upon the back ; it will give strength\nto the spine. There is want of action, and no proper\nre-action ; the blood is very acid\u2014that is the cause of\nthe rheumatism ; that will do now.\" I went back to\nmy place ; he came in and sat down, and began to\nspeak of the different spirits present, telling their names,\nand describing them, so that their relations present\nrecognized them. He said that with one lady there was\na sweet little girl who wanted to play with him, and he\nwent through the form as if playing with a child. He\nthen stood behind the Count de Mons ; addressed him as\nhis father ; lent his head against his, and spoke to him\nfor a long time in a most affectionate and touching\nmanner. He said he could become a medium and be\nable to draw. Mrs. Gregory had been very sleepy for\nsome time. Home turned to her and said, \" We wish\nto take this influence away from you ; it is purely\nphysical\u2014nothing spiritual about it ;\nyou live very much\nwith Lady Fairfax ; she is very ill ; that is what affects\nyou ;\nyou must not be too much with her ;\nyou are not\nstrong enough to bear it.\" He then made passes over\nher hands for a few minutes. Home then began talking\nto Madame de Veh, and spoke to her for some time in\na most kindly manner ; the words I forget, but they\n\f106 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nwere to the effect that she was on no account to let\nher heart grow faint ; that the future would be brighter\nthan the past ; and that there was a new development\ncoming to her (she is a writing medium) ; what it was\nthey would not tell her, but it would cause her great\nhappiness. Home spoke to several others and then said,\n\" Daniel must now come back, as we want to make\nsome manifestations.\"\nSoon after, he awoke. Although we sat for some time\nlonger, we had only slight manifestations. Two or three\npeople got up soon after he awoke, which perhaps was\nthe reason of it. During his trance. Home spoke some-\ntimes in English, sometimes in French. When he was\ndescribing the spirits present, he seemed not to be quite\ncertain about the name and relationship of one of them,\nand said he must go and find out. He rose up, went\ninto the next room, and stood there a short time by him-\nself, and then came back and told us about the spirit\nin question.\nSeptember 15th [1868].\nLast Saturday night I was very wakeful. Late at\nnight. Home being asleep, I heard raps on some part of\nthe floor near his bed. They were tolerably loud and\nmonotonous, going on with a regular beat, like the\nticking of a clock, until I fell asleep.\nAt dinner last Saturday, Home pointed out to me a\nyoung man sitting at the end of the table, and said\n\" I feel impelled towards him\u2014I have something, I know\nnot what, to say to him, or to do for him.\" After\ndinner Home went up and spoke to him, and asked him\nto come the following evening to Mrs. Hamilton's.\nNo. 22 Seance.\nLast Sunday we had a seance at Mrs. Hamilton's.\nPresent : Mr., Mrs. and Miss Hamilton ; Mrs. Main-\nwaring, Mrs. Spearman, Mr. A- ,\nHome, and myself.\n\fNO. 22] With D. D. Home 107\nSoon after we sat down, there were vibrations of the\ntable, the chairs, the floor of the room, &c., and we felt\ncold currents of air. However, it soon ceased, and we\nsat for some time without anything occurring. Some one\nsuggested that we should have tea, and try again after-\nwards. We accordingly did so ; and after the things\nwere cleared away, sat round the table again. We felt\nthe cold air and vibrations of the table. Home suddenly\nsaid that he had distinctly seen a figure pass before the\nwindow outside. Before coming to the seance, Mr. A\nhad told us a curious occurrence that happened to him\nthe previous night. He was waiting in a garden to meet\na friend of his, a lady ; and he saw her, as he supposed,\nwalking towards him. He got up and went to meet her\n;\nbut when quite close, he looked on the ground for a\nsecond, and on raising his eyes the figure had disappeared.\nHe was very anxious to know whether what he had seen\nwas a delusion ; and if not, whether the figure that\npassed the window was the same or not.\nSoon after, Home went into a trance, and sat for a\nhttle time making passes over his own eyes and head.\nHe then went and stood behind ]\\Ir. A , and looked\nat him for some time. \" Ah,\" he said, \" you are like\nthe simoon\u2014like a wild wind of the Desert.\" He talked\nto him for some httle time ; I cannot remember his\nwords. He then said, \" You have many spirits about\nyou who love you, and many who do not. Your atmo-\nsphere is very varied ; it is Hke your character, change-\nable, wild, uncertain. You are pursuing a phantom.\"\nHome also said something about marriage, but I forget\nwhat. He then sat down. ]Mr. A. had been wishing\nto hear something about the apparition he had seen the\nprevious night, but had said nothing aloud. Home\nturned to him, and said, \" Yes, it had to do with what\nyou have in your mind. You understand very well what\nI mean. When I said you were pursuing a j)hantom\nthat ought to have been sufficient answer to you. You\nwill have a vision at a moment when you least expect :\nit will be a pleasant one. Take care that you profit\nby it, or you will see one other vision which shall be\n\f108 Experiences in Spirihialism [seance\nterrible.\" Home then got up, went close to Mr. A ,\nclasped his hands together, and said, \" Ah, do think\nof what you are doing ; do reason about it.\" He then\nwalked up and down the room, raising his hands and\nletting them fall again, as a man would who had done all\nin his power and could do no more, and saying, \" The\nways of God are inscrutable \u2014the ways of God are in-\nscrutable.\" He then sat down and began explaining to\nus how God's creatures could only act according to His\nwill ; and how spirits, though they could frequently see\nevents coming on in the future, yet could not avert\nthem. \" We can see,\" he said, \" the rocks in your path,\nand can sometimes strew them and cover them with\nflowers, but we cannot remove them ;\nso, though we may\nsee misfortune\u2014though we may see blood will be\nshed about it\u2014we cannot prevent it : we can only\ninfluence, and sometimes warn.\" Turning and pointing\nsolemnly to Mr. A , he said twice, \" There is danger\nin it\u2014there is danger in it.\" He then turned to Mrs.\nMainwaring, and spoke to her to the effect that she was\nnever to allow her mind to dwell on a certain subject\nthat had occupied her three times during her life, once\nfor a whole day. \" You have got rather a low influence\nabout you,\" he said, \" because you are always expecting\nand wishing for spiritual interference in the every-day\naffairs of life. You should take a higher view of it than\nthat. You wonder why the spirits do not help you. Are you\nnot a spirit ? You are all spirits, only you have the\nearthly envelope about you. Rouse yourself, do all you\ncan to rouse yourself, and help yourself ; do not expect\nothers to help you if you do not act yourself. It is a\ncommon thing for people to say, '\nIf spirits are about us, why\ndon't they manifest themselves ?\n' Is not God everywhere ?\nIs He not about you ? Why then does He not mani-\nfest Himself ? Yet do spirits interfere in a thousand\nways that you little dream of, and never notice. God\nhas so ordained, that though many of you spend your\nlives looking for evidence of His existence, yet every day\nyou pass by unnoticed the most wonderful and beautiful\nevidences.\n\fNO. 22J With D. D. Home 109\n\" Do not suppose for a moment that you can do any-\nthing in secret ; have no false modesty or false shame,\nand think not to do that in private which you would not\ndo before the world. If it be not enough for man to\nknow that God is everywhere, and sees all his actions,\nthen let him remember also, that his father, mother,\nbrothers, sisters and all those most dear to him, are con-\ntinually about him ; do nothing therefore in private that\nyou would be ashamed of doing openly.\" Turning to\nMrs. Spearman, he said, \" Louisa, when your mother\nsuffers from those acute pains in her limbs, she should\nfoment them with an infusion of hops, just pour boihng\nwater on the hops, and use it as hot as she can bear.\nHops are very good ;\nthey not only act as a sedative,\ncalm the nerves and mitigate the pain, but they also\nstrengthen and act as a tonic.\" He then, after hstening\napparently at J\\Irs. Hamilton's ear, said, \" The oil is too\nheavy against the drum of the ear, that is why your\ndeafness was increased.\" Turning to Miss Hamilton, he\nsaid, \" Mary, yovi have used more than we ordered ; we\nprescribed one drop only, you ought not to have used\nmore ; for the future, drop the oil on a bit of cotton\nand use a httle ether with it.\"\nHome then got up, walked round the table, taking\nour hands one after the other. He was then twice\nelongated and shortened to less than his natural height.\nHe made Mr. A put his foot on his feet, and place\nhis hands, one on his chest, the other just above his hips,\nin order that he might be sure that he was standing\nfairly on the ground, and that he might also feel the\nelongation and contraction taking place. He then sat\ndown and turned to me, laughed, and speaking in quite\na different tone of voice, said, \" A. M says she will\ncome to you to-night. She says she was with you last\nnight, and made those monotonous taps that you heard\n;\nshe wanted you to sleep and thought that might send\nyou to sleep. She says she made those slow regular\nsounds, Uke as it were the rocking of a cradle, as a\nsort of lullaby to soothe you. She says she will be able\nnow sometimes to make sounds like that, even when you\n\f110 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nare alone. When Dan said last night something about\nhaving been praying for you, it was she who spoke\nthrough him ; it was not Dan who spoke at all himself.\nYou had better tell him this as he has been rather\nworrying himself, thinking that his mind must have been\nwandering in his sleep. Dan will come back now ; sit\nfor five or ten minutes, and we will try and make some\nmanifestations-; we want John to see some.\" Home\nthen awoke, and we sat for a little time, but had scarcely\nanything more. We then broke up and a most extra-\nordinary thing occurred. I was standing in the balcony,\nthe rest were about the table ; all of a sudden the gas\nwent out and the room was in darkness ; the gas was\nnot turned off, but went out. They all declared that no\none was . near the burner ; three people, ]Mr. Home,\nMiss Hamilton, and Mrs. Mainwaring, said that they\ndistinctly saw a hand and arm stretched out over their\nheads upon the jet of gas and that at that moment it\nwent out. They said it was so distinct that their first\nidea was that some one had gone suddenly crazy and\nmust have burned themselves.\nMr. Hamilton told me next morning that he had\ninvestigated it, and found that at the same moment\neight jets of gas went out in the house, namely one in\nthe room in which we were ; two in the next ;\nthree,\nI think, on the landing and stairs, and two in the kitchen.\nThe meter had not been turned off, the meter does not\ncommunicate with the street gas, but has a separate pipe\nleading to the gasometer.\nThat night we heard raps announcing, I suppose, the\npresence of Adah Menken ;\nthey did not last however.\nJust as I was going to sleep. Home who was asleep,\nturned in his bed, and said, \" I have been trying but I\ncannot.\" He said it in a different tone of voice to his\nown, and as if he was rather vexed at having failed. I\nsaid, \" Never mind,\" which awoke him, and he asked me\nif he had been talking in his sleep.\n\fNO. 23] With D. D. Home 111\nNo. 23 Seance\u2014Sunday, September 20th [1868],\n5, Buckingham Oate.\nLast Friday night, after we had gone to bed, we were\ntalking, and I was saying something about how small\nand trivial our hves on earth must appear after we have\npassed away. A spirit joined our conversation by saying\n\" Yes,\" by three very emphatic loud raps. Home pre-\nsently had a sort of vision ;\nbeing quite awake, and\nknowing where he was, and describing to me what he\nsaw, he said, \" I am in a desert, that is Just at the\nedge of a great desert\u2014there is a sort of barrier between\nme and it. The desert is perfectly barren, there is no\nlight of the sun, but a great cross at the far side of it,\nand the light flowing from the cross is lighting it all up,\nthe cross means truth ; there are a number of pigmies\nall about the cross. Oh, it is so strange, they are all\nworking away as hard as they can, and trying to build\nup blocks of stone and rubbish and stuff before the cross,\nbut as they build them up, the blocks become trans-\nparent, and the light from the cross still shines through\nthem. The pigmies are digging away and working so\nhard about it, they seem to have made a desert of the\nplace by digging out earth and stufi^ to hide out the\ncross.\" Home suddenly stopped talking, and when he\nspoke again, was in a trance, he said, \" Now that you are\nquietly at home, we wish to explain to you how it was\nthat Dan was so nervous at Homburg.\" He then ex-\nplained some circumstances that had puzzled me a good\ndeal. He went on to say, \" After that Dan caught a\ncold, you also felt the same influence and you caught\na chill, then the magnetic atmosphere of that man Roniker\nwas so strong, that it irritated your nerves intensely,\nand on that night you were on the point of having\nbrain fever, but by the foot bath that we influenced\nDan to insist upon your having, and by magnetizing you\nthrough Dan, it was prevented. It was Adah Menken that\ninfluenced Dan in that matter.\" I remarked how thankful\nI was. Home said, \" Oh, it was .not Adah Menken that\nmagnetized you. She made Dan see that vision he told\n\f112 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nyou of, she is very often about you.\" I said that it was\nvery good of her to endeavour to do us good. Ah, he\nsaid, \" It does her good ! Ah, if bitter tears could wipe\naway the recollection of what has been, and the know-\nledge of what might have been ;\nwell, it was not to be.\nIt was not, therefore, it was not to be. Adah Menken\nwas the most suited of all the spirits about you to\ninterfere in that matter at Homburg that you know of ;\nher hfe had made her more capable of it, in fact\u2014as\nshe laughingly says herself\n\u2014' You must set a thief to\ncatch a thief.' She says that the wish you expressed at\nHomburg shall be gratified. Get her book. She says,\n'\nIf I could send it to you or write an order for it I\nwould, you know ; but then I cannot.' However, it is\nvery small and not expensive, and you can very well\nafford to buy it, so if you will get it, she says she will\nthis winter write her name in it for you. You remember\nsaying that you wished to see an instance of direct\nspirit writing, she thinks that will be a nice way to do\nit for you ; she will do the same for Dan.\" I said,\n\" Shall I tell Dan ?\n\" \" By all means. Dan is now\ncoming back to his desert, he will not know anything\nabout this httle episode.\" Having a matter on my mind,\nI said, \" May I ask a question ?\n\" He said, \" Yes,\"\nbefore I spoke, having read my thoughts and said, \" Yes,\"\nagain, when I asked. I accordingly asked about what I\nwanted to know, and received an answer and explanation ;\nwhile he was speaking he laughed, and said, \" Some\nspirits say we should not tell you too much, since this\nis in the future.\" Home then awoke and took up the\nthread of his description of the desert, directly after he\nsaid, \"It is beginning to fade,\" the vision then melted\naway gradually.\nNo. 24 Seance.\nOn Saturday we had a seance at Mr. S.

Before we sat down there were raps all about\nthe room ;\nimmediately after we were seated strong\nphysical manifestations took place, violent trembhng of\nchairs, table, floor, &c., &c. ; currents of cold air, very\nloud raps in various directions ; the table tilted, moved,\nand was raised from the ground ; some questions were\nanswered. Home was in a very nervous state, presently\nhe went into a trance and said, \" We are doing this to\ncalm Dan ; talk.\" He then got up, walked about the\nroom, sat down and played the piano for a little time ;\nhe then arose, went to the boy and placed his hands\nupon his head, patting and stroking it ; he then went to\nthe Comtesse de Pomare, but when he came near her\nhe drew back, shuddered, and looked distressed, \" Ah,\"\nhe said, \" there is something here the spirits do not hke.\"\nSome one said, \"It is because you are in mourning, and\nhave crape on your dress.\" \" Yes,\" he said, \" We do not\nlike that at all. He (her husband) has pulled your\ndress two or three times, as you are aware of, he will\ntry presently and tear a bit of the black crape off to\nshew you that he does not like it.\"\nWe began to talk about the custom of wearing mourn-\ning, and the difficulty there would be in breaking through\nit. Home walked about the room ; then sat down and\nsaid something to this effect : \"If you like to put on\nsome outward sign of woe while those you love are in\ngloom before dissolution, do so ; but to put on mourning\nafter that, when a soul has been set free, and has risen\nnearer to God\u2014yes, nearer to God\u2014oh, no ; rather put\non all that is pleasant\u2014all that is pleasing to the eye,\nand cheerful ;\nbut, if you think that soul is not\nworthy of approaching nearer to God, but must be in\ndarkness and tears, then, if you will, put on mourning ;\nbut wear it longer than six months or a year.\" \" Yes,\"\nthe Comtesse remarked, \" but we do not wear mourning\nbecause we think that a soul is unhappy ; but because\nwe ourselves are unhappy.\" Home said, \" Have you so\nhttle confidence in God, that you cannot trust Him to\ndo all for the best ?\n\" He then spoke of some of the\nH\n\f114 Experiences in Spirihialism [seance\nspirits present, chiefly addressing the Comtesse. He then\nturned to Mr. Hall, and told him his sister was present\n;\nhe smiled and said, \" She is standing just there behind\nyou-\u2014she has a communication to make to you, but she\ncannot make it now ; she seems so gentle and timid.\"\nThen he laughed, and said, \" She has such a funny habit\nof shading her eyes with her hand, as if she was afraid\nthe light would hurt them. Of course, it does not ; but\nshe cannot get rid of the habit now and then, and the\nothers are smiling at her for it. She is doing hke this\nnow,\" and he shaded his eyes with one hand, and went\nfeeling about before him with the other (Mr. Hall's sister\nhad been quite blind, and had had the habit of shading\nher eyes and feeling before her, so that was a good\ntest of identity). Home then turned to me, and said,\n\" There is a spirit standing near you that went through\na great deal of sufliering before passing away, her name\nis V ; she and the other spirit (Mr. Hall's sister)\nseem so much drawn to each other. They both under-\nwent a great deal of suffering, and that appears to draw\nthem to each other. They are talking about it now, and\nthey are speaking of their suffering, as if it had somehow\npurified them, and as if they were so thankful for it,\nand considered it to have been the greatest blessing.\"\nHe told me that we should see lights that night, and\nthen said \" Daniel is now coming back.\" He then awoke.\nWe had some more physical manifestations, and the\naccordion was played under the table. Home holding it\nin his hand. It was then suggested to put out the lights,\nand try if we could see anything ; the candles were\naccordingly put out, and we should, I think, have had a\nwonderful seance, but that the son of the Comtesse de\nPomare got so frightened and nervous we were obliged\nto stop. We had strong physical manifestations, the\ntable being lifted high in the air ; the window curtains\nwere moved, one being carried right across the table,\nand twined round Mrs. Hall ; the other was drawn\nbetween Home and me, laid over my shoulder, and across\nmy knee. I had hold of the curtain while it was moving,\nand felt that there was a hand moving it, but when I\n\fNO. 24] With D. D. Home 115\ntried to touch the hand it shd away. I and several\nothers saw a form moving about behind me and Home,\nand another form at the opposite side of the room, and\nwe were touched at different times ; however the boy\ngot so frightened we had to light the candles, and put\nan end to the seance.\nThe same night Home had to drop some lotion into\nhis eyes. I dropped it in for him, and then put the\nlights out. Almost immediately he said, \" What a curious\neffect that stuff has had, I see the most beautiful little\nHghts before me.\" I said, \" That is not the effect of\nthe drops ;\nyou said when in a trance that we should\nsee Ughts.\" \" That may be,\" he replied, \" but, what I\nsee is in my eye,\" and so positive was he that he came\nover to me and asked me to look into his eye, and try\nif I could not see them ; of course I could not. He went\nback to bed, and then I began to see the lights, and he\nwas satisfied that they were not in his eye. I saw the\nmost beautiful httle phosphorescent hghts moving. I saw\nas many as three at a time ; sometimes there were two\ntogether hke eyes, sometimes two would come together,\nand then dart away again from each other. We had no\nother manifestations.\nNo. 25 Seance\u2014at Ashley House, October 20t.h [1868].\nPresent : Captain Wynne (Charhe) and his wife, Brinsley\nNixon and his wife, Home and myself. We sat at a\nsmall card table. There were shght manifestations, currents\nof cold air, vibration of the table and chairs, and raps.\nThe alphabet was called, and the sentence was given :\n\" Sit at the other table.\" As soon as the influence became\npretty strong, the table was moved towards the card\ntable. After a while we got up, and as they evidently\nwished to alter the position of the table, we moved it\nourselves into the centre of the room, and sat down\nagain. We soon felt violent vibration of the floor, chairs,\nand table\u2014so violent that the glass pendants of the\n\f116 Ex'periences in Spiritualism [seance\nchandelier struck together, and the windows and doors\nshook and rattled in their frames, not only in the room\nin which we were sitting, but also in the next. The\ncard table was moved (no one touching it) up to our\ntable, and the two were pressed hard together. The sofa\nwas, under the same conditions, moved up to our table.\nA sentence was soon after given :\n\" We had to overcome the\ninfluence of the little table, and we have accomplished it.\"\nShortly after we were told to move the table and sofa\nback to their places. We had raps on both the tables\nand on the floor, and the spirits joined in our conversa-\ntion two or three times by rapping \" Yes \" or \" iVo.\" The\nfollowing message was then given :\n\" We have fnade\nthese external manifestations to convince 7jou all ; Charlie,\nask questiofis, we have a ivork to do -with you.\"\nCharlie asked if Augusta would recover ;\nthey rapped\n\" Yes \" emphatically. He asked if his sister would, and\nafter a pause they answered \" Perhaps,\" by touching him\ntwice upon the knee. He asked if they could bring us\nword what Augusta was then doing ; and afterwards\nasked for the name of the spirit who had touched him.\n\" Will \" was spelled, and a \" W \" ; but the power then\nappeared to cease, as we could get nothing more. After\na pause, they spelled \" Father,\" but the power again\nfailed. After an interval they said, \" We have not power\nto do more noiv ; find violin near,\" referring to the fact,\nI suppose, that Augusta had her viohn near her. We had\nno further manifestations after this. Both Emmy's and\nCadly's dresses were pulled during the evening.\nAfter they had all gone, Home went into a trance.\n\" Ah,\" he said, \" there was nothing wrong ; no evil\ninfluence to overcome about that little table. It was\nrather this way ;\nyou had been accustomed to sit at the\nother table ;\nyou had eaten off it, and always sat at it,\nand it had therefore become as it were partially magnetized\nby you. We were obliged to equalize the power over the\nroom and furniture ; and we therefore brought the two\ntables in contact, and moved up the sofa to inoculate\nthem, as we might say. There was nothing evil about the\ncard table. There is no such thing as evil in your sense\n\fNO. 25] With D. D. Home 117\nof the word. Evil is but good perverted and distorted,\ngnarled and twisted out of shape. As a blade springing\nup through the ground if it meets with a stone that\nobstructs it, is forced out of its course, stunted and\nthwarted, so is good changed by circumstances into what\nyou call evil. If evil was as you think, you would have\nto say that the devil had made the world to answer\nhis purpose, but it is not so ; God has made the world to\nanswer his ends. You may not be able to see how all\nthis evil can ever harmonize and resolve into good ;\nbut it is nevertheless so. Because the sun rises in the\nmidst of clouds in the morning you do not know that it\nwill be cloudy all day ; no ; so it is that though all\nmay be dark and cloudy now, it will end in brightness.\n\" It is wonderful to stand as it were above and outside\nthe world, and to watch the great wheels revolving ; the\ncogs look all black and broken, covered sometimes with\nblood, and disfigured ; but yet they all fit in and work\non smoothly, though to you. it appears otherwise. Yet\na time will come when there will be peace and knowledge\non the earth about all those matters that so much distract\nit now. The world revolves in its sphere, turning on its\naxis, and will enter upon a region of greater peace and\nknowledge.\n\" You do not know the difficulties that have to be over-\ncome in communicating with you. Supposing now we\nwant to make manifestations, four spirits would perhaps\ntake possession of the four corners of the room, and\nwould begin, as it were, to throw across to each other,\nand weave together their harmonizing influence, so as to\nget everything equahzed and prepared for the adoption\nof whatever they want to do. One spirit will remain\nin the midst who will manage and direct all that is to\nbe said\u2014of course, if one of the other spirits wish to\ncommunicate he would let him do so, they are not\nselfish, but one must have the direction of the mani-\nfestations to ensure unity of purpose. That is why it\nis so bad to wish for the presence of any particular\nspirit ;\nthat spirit might come, and the others not being\nselfish would admit him into the circle, and he not being\n\f118 Experiences in Sjnrihialism [seance\nin harmony with the others, would destroy the whole\nthing. You may often notice, especially at the commence-\nment of a seance, a whole volley of taps let off, that\nis a spirit discharging the electricity, to equahze the\ncurrent ; often until the whole is harmonized we cannot\nstop ourselves from making raps and cannot control them ;\nso that a spirit might at first, if you wanted them to\ncommunicate before they were ready themselves, answer\n\"Yes\" for \"No,\" and \"No\" for \"Yes.\" If you put\nyour ear also against the table while communications\nare being given by raps, you will generally hear a number\nof little ticks going on ; that is, some spirits are dis-\ncharging the electricity to keep the current in equili-\nbrium, while the others communicate.\n\"If we did not take all these careful precautions there\ncould be no conversation, nothing but a chaos of sounds\nand raps. It is this same difficulty\u2014the difficulty of\nencountering the materiahsm of all about you, that is\nthe cause of a great deal that you call bad and evil\ninfluence. A spirit might be standing near you that loved\nyou very much, that was not the least impure, and that\nwished to soothe and comfort you ; and yet he might\nonly serve to irritate you, and the more anxious he was\nto soothe, the more he might irritate and distress, because\nhe was not in harmony with you. You can feel that\nyourselves ;\nyou are not always in harmony with your\nbest friends, and sometimes you do not feel as much at\nease with them, as you would among strangers, and would\nhave more difficulty in showing off any accomplishment,\nsuch as playing, singing, &c., &c., to them than you would\nto strangers. Now, this case of the lady who is said\nto have had her hair pulled out by the roots ; it might\nhappen that a spirit that loved her very much was\nstanding near, perhaps even her own father wished to\nsoothe her and caress her hair, and it might have the\neffect of irritating intensely ; he could not stop himself,\nhe could not withdraw in a moment the electric current\nthat was set going, and the consequences might be\npainful ; of course all this applies chiefly to undeveloped\nand partially developed medivims.\"\n\fNO. 25] With D. D. Home 119\nQuestion.\u2014As it is so difficult to influence men are you\nnot constantly endeavouring to do certain things and\nfailing 1\nAnswer.\u2014To a certain extent,\u2014yes. But spiritual in-\nfluence has much more to do with the affairs of the\nworld than what you dream of. All inspiration, poetry,\nimprovising as in the case of the old Troubadours,\u2014all\nthat is owing to it\u2014everything in fact, is set in motion\nby spiritual interference. To those who pray earnestly\nfor and seek for hght and truth, hght will certainly be\ngiven ; our greatest difficulty is the folly of men's hearts,\nand their blindness. There are thousands of men who\npray that rather than that SpirituaHsm should be under-\nstood, men should beheve it to be the work of the\ndevil ; to advance themselves one day only, they would\nretard the progress of the world for ages. Every prayer\nhas its effect, and every aspiration and wish is a prayer ;\nit is not necessary to go down on your bended knees to\npray. Would that you could see as we do the great\nblack cloud (to speak figuratively) of prayers and aspira-\ntions that is for ever rising up from a populous haunt of\nmankind like this great city of London. Aspiration for\ntruth and knowledge will surely bring its answer, and as\nsurely does every prayer to the contrary distort and\nretard true progress.\nQuestion.\u2014I had a question put to me the other day\nas regards the comparative truth of different sects, which\nI answered according to my abihty. I should be glad to\nknow if I answered with anything hke truth.\nA7iswer.\u2014There is truth in every rehgion ; even the\npoor Pagan, who bows down before his idol, possesses\nthe germ of truth, inasmuch as he worships something\noutside and beyond himself. It is very wrong\u2014oh, very\nwrong indeed, to say there is only one portal to heaven ;\nwere that the case, there would be few indeed who would\narrive there. You are right in supposing that the form of\nrehgion which is best suited to a man, though it may\ncontain a smaller proportion of truth than another form,\nis yet the best for him ;\nbeing the most adapted to his\ncharacter and mind, it is that in which he can expand\n\f120 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nand improve himself to the best advantage. A good\nanswer for you to have given would be :\n'\nSpirits teach\nindividuality of spirit.' As you leave this world you are\napt\u2014oh, very apt indeed\u2014to continue for a long time.\nThose who seek not to raise themselves, and look not\nfor truth, must continue as they were until they\u2014to\nuse a common expression\u2014find it does not pay ; then they\nwill try to improve and will do so. There is this in-\ndividuality ;\nand a man is apt to get around him an\ninfluence agreeing with himself. Like seeks like every-\nwhere\u2014it is a universal law. The crow cannot consort\nwith the eagle, or the magpie with the dove.\"\nQuestion.\u2014\" Have we not better opportunities here\nthan we shall ever have hereafter of forming ourselves ?\n\"\n\" Most certainly, this is your time. If you strive earnestly\nand prayerfully here, you enter your true hfe in a state\nfitted for it. Seek for truth and you shall find it.\"\nAccount of Manifestations at Stockton.\nLittle Dannie Cox died in London last Sunday, the\n11th October, 1868 ;\nHome, who was his godfather, and\nvery much attached to him, was extremely cut up about\nit at first. On the Monday morning. Home breakfasted\nwith me at No. 5. I was reading the Daily Telegraph\nover the fire, waiting for breakfast, and he was sitting\nat the writing table, we heard loud raps on the floor\nbetween us ; and the following message was given ^ :\n\u2014\n\" We wish you to take the body to Stockton (Mr. Cox's\nplace in the country) to-morrow ; you ivill place the coffin\nin the draivi^ig-room ; and. at half-past eight we will show\nyou a spiritual funeral. You will take care that all the\nfamily are there, and no one else ; if I ivant Mr. Bat\n(family lawyer) \/ will send for him. I invite your friend\nto be present.\" After this we went to breakfast, and\nthe same spirit rapped repeatedly on the table during\nbreakfast, and answered some questions.\n1 Believed to be by the spirit of the late Mr. Cox.\n\fNO. 26] With D. D. Home 121\nNo. 26 Seance.\n^\nThe next morning the body was sent down ; I accom-\npanied Home and Mrs. Cox. The drawing-room was\nmost prettily arranged, everything being covered with\nwhite drapery, and quantities of flowers and ferns taste-\nfuUy placed. The coffin was open, and the httle body\nentirely covered with flowers, all but the face ; which\n} looked very calm and peaceful.\nAt half-past eight o'clock we all entered the room,\nand sat down, forming a sort of circle, but having no\ntable. Home went into a trance, got up and fetching a\nchair sat down close to the coffin ; he then took Mrs.\nCox's hands in his and dehvered a most wonderful dis-\ncourse, taking as it were for his text, the words, \" The\nLord gave and the Lord hath not taken away, blessed be\nthe name of the Lord.\" He went through the greater\npart of the burial service, explaining and expounding ;\nI\nhe then spake in the most consoling manner to Mrs.\nI- Cox, bidding her have confidence in God and in His\ngoodness, and not to look upon (hat as a separation\nwhich was not so in reahty ; told her the little boy\nwould be continually with her, was there even now\n;\nspoke of his purity and happiness, told her to be strong\nand not to give way to sorrow ; but now that her\nhusband and other relatives had undertaken the develop-\nment of little Dannie, she was to devote herself all the\nmore to the education of the two remaining children.\nHe then took Gerrie, the other son, by the hand, and spoke\nto him for some time in the most impressive manner\nabout his future conduct through life, bidding him be an\nhonest God-fearing man, and to remember that his brother\nwould be cognizant of all his actions and therefore not\nto do that which he knew would offend or grieve him.\nHe then took the httle girl's hand, petting and comforting\n' her, and giving her messages from Dannie about his pet\nrabbits and things of that sort, and telling her that\nDannie would often be in communion with her in her\nsleep, and that she would dream of going about with him.\nHe then walked round the circle, taking each one's hand\n\f122 Experiences in Spiritualism [SEAKCE\nand saying a kind word or two, and standing up in the\ncentre, and pointing to each of us, enumerated the spirits\npresent, saying, \" Your mother, your brother, and so on.\"\nHe then made a sign to signify that they were all stand-\ning round him, and raising his hands, prayed in the most\nbeautiful and earnest way for some little time, and then\nsat down again in his place ; he said that little Dannie\nwould make raps, and we heard three distinct little ticks,\nhke electric sparks going off ; he said we should recognize\nDannie by the pecuharity of his raps. He then said,\n\" We wished to have made physical manifestations, but\nDan is spiritually weak and we cannot, but something\nwill occur to-night.\" After Home awoke, we went into\nthe conservatory, and again heard httle Dannie rapping\non the floor and on the glass.\nAt supper, at about ten o'clock, there came suddenly\nvery loud raps all around on the table, walls, floor,\n&c., &c. I never heard them so loud before. Home was\nentranced, and taking Mrs. Cox by the hand led her\ninto the drawing-room. When there, she heard something\nrusthng near the coffin, and immediately felt a little\nhand touch her, and place between her fingers a sprig of\nlauristinus. Home then brought her back into the supper\nroom ; and somebody remarked that lauristinus meant in\nthe language of flowers\n\u2014\" If neglected, I die.\" Home\nawoke immediately.\nHe and I slept in the same room. Soon after he had\ngone to bed, he went into a trance ; and began discours-\ning about moral principles, &c. He then said, \" You\ntell his mother in the morning that Dannie gave her that\nsprig of lauristinus, which means, '\nIf neglected, I die '\n;\nbecause he wanted to show her that if she did anything\nunworthy of him it would give him pain. Your greatest\nidea of pain is death ;\nyou are wrong there ; but that\nis your idea, and therefore he put it in that way.\" I made\nsome remark about its being a very wonderful thing\nhis giving her the flower. He said, \" We are going to\ndo something still more wonderful for you. A little later,\nwhen the house is quite still, you and Dan are to get\nup ;\nyou will take the slippers ; we will take care Dan\n\fNO. 26] With D. D. Home 123\ndoes not catch cold. You are to go downstairs, and\ninto the drawing-room ; Dan will stand at the door ;\nand you are to go alone up to that little box you call\na coffin, and hft the lid a httle ; and then return to\nDan\u2014that is all. Little Dannie's colours are purple and\nwhite\u2014signs of the greatest purity ;\npurple and white\nare the most perfect colours ; remember that ; and after\nthem blue, and so on down to black, which is the lowest.\"\nHome then awoke, and presently said, \" I feel impressed\nto open the door.\" \" Well,\" I said, \" do so if you hke ;\nit can do no harm.\" He got up and did so ;\nand, on\nhis way back to bed, I heard some spirit tap him on the\nshoulder. He said something in answer, and went into\na trance ; he picked up the shppers, put them on my\nfeet, and told me to get up. \" Do not be afraid,\" he\nsaid, \" I require no light to guide my footsteps.\" He\ntook both my hands in his, and then led me rapidly,\nwithout hesitation, out of the room, down the stairs,\nand across the hall, the place being perfectly dark. He\nconducted me into the drawing-room, and then stood\nstill, saying, \" Now walk straight before you to the coffin,\nand do as you have been told.\" I did so, raising the\ndrapery, and Lifting the lid at the head about an inch.\nHome said \" Raise it a httle higher, about as high as\nwould permit a hand entering.\" I did so, and heard some-\nthing rustle inside. Home said, \" That is sufficient.\"\nI replaced the lid, and returned to where Home was\nstanding. He, as before, took both my hands in his,\nled me upstairs, and into the bedroom, closed the door,\nand put me down in a chair by the window, still retaining\nmy hands in the same position. He said, \" Little Dannie\nis here between you and the light ; can you not see\nhim ?\n\" \" No,\" I said, \" I cannot.\" He laughed and\nsaid, \" Dannie would make himself appear as white ;\nbut he cannot just yet ; he has so recently come to us.\nHe will try and make himself visible as a dark shadow to\nyou.\" I still said that I could see nothing. \" Ah, never\nmind !\n\" Home said ; and holding one of my hands in\nhis he stretched it out in the dark, and said, \" Dannie\nwill let you play with it first.\" I perceived a strong\n\f124 Experiences in S-piritualism [seance\nscent, as it were, blown over me, and felt a flower\ntouch my fingers and then withdraw itself. Presently, I\nfelt a little soft hand touch mine, and a flower was given\nme. I then felt a strong tremor run through Home's\nhands, and he spoke as little Dannie, and said, \" You\nmust get into bed quickly ; Dan is going to awake ;\nif you would like very much to see what you have got\nyou can make an excuse to light a candle presently.\"\nAccordingly, after Home had awoke, I lit a candle, and\nfound I had been given a purple and white petunia that\nhad been placed in one of the little hands in the coffin.\nNo. 21.-~Seance.\nThe next evening we had another seance, this time\nsitting round a table placed against the head of the\ncoffin. The coffin had been fastened down and covered\nwith white drapery, most prettily arranged with flowers\nand ferns. We had physical manifestations and some\nmessages from little Dannie, the table on which the coffin\nwas placed was moved about, the drapery agitated, &c.\nWe then heard pieces of fern being plucked, we could\ndistinctly hear the branches broken ; a piece of fern was\ngiven to each person present, their attention being called\nto it by being touched on the knee, and the hand being\nthen placed beneath the table the fern was put into it.\nWith the fern presented to me, the following message was\ngiven :\n\u2014\" Birth has given you distinction, let your life he\nthe more distinguished for a prayerful and earnest search\nafter truth ; it is kind of you to have come to the house\nof joy ; truth seekers are brothers and sisters and should\nshare each other s sorroivs and joys.\" Home then went\ninto a trance, and took the lamp out of the room, saying\nwe were to see a manifestation that could only take\nplace in the dark. We presently saw a brilliant httle\nstar, it flitted about with an uncertain-like motion\u2014some-\ntimes approaching, sometimes receding from us. We\nheard raps come from the star which flashed like an\nelectric spark at each detonation. Mrs. Cox suddenly\n\fNO. 27] With D. D. Home 125\nsaid that a quantity of Eau de Cologne had been thrown\nover her from the ceihng. Home carried a small flask\ncontaining some which the spii'its probably made use\nof. Home, who was standing at some distance from\nus, said, we should have the odour changed four times\nand in effect a totally different scent was blown over us\nfour times on a palpable strong current of air. Home\nthen fetched the lamp back. We heard a knocking at\nthe door, he opened it and appeared to invite some one\nto come in, but did not succeed ; he shut the door,\nwhen the knocking re-commenced he oj^ened it again,\nbut was unsuccessful ; this was repeated three or four\ntimes, at last he went and gathering some ferns and\n. flowers from off the coffin opened the door and held\nthem out ; still it was in vain, the knocking again\noccurred at the door, and this time he took little Ada\nand led her to the door, when he appeared to succeed\nin inducing the person to come in. He said, \" It\nis \" (a little servant girl who had died two days\npreviously). \" How very curious, she seems scarcely to\nknow that she has passed away, and says, she does not\nlike to come into the room where there is anybody dead.\nEvery time I opened the door she said, '\nNo thank you,\nI would sooner not !\n\" But little Dannie wanted her to\ncome in and rapped, or rather got another spirit to rap\nfor him at the door, every time I shut it. I took the\nflowers and ferns to show her there was nothing dis-\nagreeable about the room, and then I took little Ada with\nme, and she has come in now and is standing there in\nthe corner. She will move this fern that I have placed\nhere on the table near her.\" Home placed a fern on the\ntable, and presently we saw it taken up and put down\nagain. He then awoke.\nThe next afternoon the httle body was placed in the\nground. During the service a shght shower came on ;\nbut just at the conclusion, when we had lowered the\ncoffin to its place, a bright beam of sunshine broke out,\nflooding us with hght ; and a beautiful rainbow appeared\n\f126 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nin the heavens. On our way home, every one remarked\nthat the burial service, which is in general so impressive,\nhad that day while in church sounded strangely flat and\nunprofitable. Mrs. Cox asked how it was that the clergy-\nman had not used the words dust to dust, ashes to ashes,\nearth to earth. We assured her he had ; but she declared\nshe had not heard them, although standing as near to\nhim as any of us.\nNo. 28.\n\u2014\nSeance.\nThe same evening we had a seance, and Home was\nentranced\u2014Mr. Cox speaking through him. He turned to\nMrs. Cox and said, \" I was there with httle Dannie to-day,\nbut I did not like to take him into the church ; we\nwaited outside. The reason why the service did not\nimpress any of you is, that there was no spiritual presence\ninside the building\u2014nothing but the bare rafters. We\nmagnetized you to prevent your hearing the words\n\u2014\ndust to dust, ashes to ashes, earth to earth. Now, if\nyou had been consigning to the earth this day the body\nof some celebrated mediaeval ecclesiastic or great saint,\nthose circumstances of the shower of rain, the bright\ngleam of sun, and the rainbow, would have been considered\nmiraculous. Of course they were not so ; it is unreasonable\nto think that God's great laws should be interfered with\nto give you a rainbow. Yet was it the result of inter-\nference in this way. We knew by our superior knowledge\nof meteorology, and the laws that govern those things,\nthat at that hour on Thursday, there would pro-\nbably be a combination of circumstances that would\nproduce those effects. We therefore very strongly impressed\nDan to insist upon having the funeral on Thursday instead\nof Friday, which was the day you had fixed upon ; and\nwe impressed him to make you all hurry. You remember\nhow he did hurry you all on your way to church. As\nit happened, you arrived at the right time, and every-\nthing occurred just as we expected. That is all the\ninterference there was.\" He then spoke for some time\n\fKO. 28] With D. D. Home 127\nto Mrs. Cox, exhorting her to have patience and courage,\nand to trust in God. Tlie \" Nameless Doctor \" then took\npossession of Home ; who after walking about the room\nthinking, took httle Ada's hand in his, and said to Mrs.\nCox, \" This child's stomach is of more importance now than\nher brain ; do not push her too much in her studies.\"\nDr. Elliotson then took possession of him, and he spoke\nfor some time to Mrs. Cox. Then turning to me he\nsaid, \" I suppose you have found out, if not you will\n\u2014\nI know I did when on earth\u2014that if you try and climb\nup one rung higher on the ladder of knowledge than\nothers, the world will scream and say you are going to\ntumble down and break your neck ; but when they find\nyou stick there pretty safely, they will try and scramble\nup after you, and endeavour to get ahead of you. Pro-\nvided your own conscience does not reprove you, never\nmind what the world says. As my friend, Mr. Cox said\nto you yesterday, '\nBe constant in a prayerful and earnest\nsearch for truth ; seek truth, and you will find it.' \" He\nwent on speaking for some time, describing different\nphases of worldly ambition, and warning us against them.\nNo. 29.\n\u2014\nSeance, November 3rd, 1868.\nIn the account of the phenomena that occurred at\nHomburg, mention is made of Home finding a death's-\nhead moth ; of my being told to play with two louis, and\nwith the proceeds to buy a locket with it. I took the\nmoth to Tessier's, and ordered a crystal medalhon to be\nmade for it. In due course it was sent home. While\nHome was sitting with httle Dannie Cox, during his last\nillness, the locket in his pocket was broken by a blow\nfrom some invisible hand, or other agency. We speculated\nas to the reason for this, but came to no satisfactory\nresult. The day before yesterday I asked for the locket,\nin order to get it mended. When I saw it, I thought\nthat the material was glass and not crystal. I took it\nto my optician, and found I was correct. I then took it\n\f128 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nto Tessier's to have a proper crystal made. Yesterday,\nwhile washing my hands before dinner, I said to Home,\n\" I now know why the locket was broken ; it was to call\nattention to the fact that glass had been substituted for\ncrystal.\" Immediately a spirit rapped \" Yes,\" very loudly,\non the dressing table. About nine o'clock I was reading ;\nHome lying on the sofa. He said, \" There is a strong\nspirit standing near you ; he is nicely made, and appears\nto have nice features, but I cannot see them clearly.\nHis hair is cut very short indeed, and [he] has a sort of\nmark not amounting to a scar, upon his cheek bone.\" I\ncould not think who it was, when it seemed to flash upon\nme that it was A B ,\nthough I could not recognize\nhim the least by the description. Home said, \" His\nname begins with an A.\" I said, \" No ; with a B, if it\nis the person I imagine.\" \" His name begins with an A,\"\nhe said, \" that is, of course, his Christian name. \" Well,\"\nI said, \" that would be right.\" \" Yes,\" Home said, \" his\nname is A ; he says he will come to us to-night.\"\nHome said it was a case of second sight, and asked me to\nlook at his eyes to try and discover the film that is said to\ncover the eyes of a person during second sight. I could\nsee nothing abnormal about them, except that the pupils\nwere much dilated ; on applying light near them they\ncontracted naturally. The vision had nearly faded when I\nexamined his eyes.\nLater in the evening we had a seance. Present : C. and\nE. Wynne, C. and B. Nixon, James Gore-Booth, Home and\nmyself. We sat for about an hour, and scarcely anything\noccurred. We then went into the dining-room to have\na cup of tea, and raps came on the table. We returned\nto the other room and sat down, but had only very\nfaint- indications of spiritual presence. Home said to me,\n\" Let you and I and Charlie Wynne go into the bed-\nroom by ourselves for a minute, perhaps they would tell\nus the reason why we have no manifestations.\" We did\nso, and put our hands upon a small table. The table\ntilted itself into Charlie's lap ; and we had messages\n\fNO. 29] With D. D. Home 129\ngiven by tilts of the table, by raps on the table, and on\nthe floor.\nMessage to CharUe.\n\u2014\" We are developing you. You\nheard sowids like drops of rain upon your pillow ; you\nwill soon he able to have raps ; persevere in sitting as you\nhave done at home : you will be rewarded by rnanifestatiotis.\"\nCharUe asked, \" Was that shaking of my bed anything\nspiritual ?\n\" \" Yes, like this table is shaken.\" Charhe :\n\" Yes, that is hke it exactly ; but I do not Hke to be\nshaken in bed.\" The table was shaken more violently,\nas if to say that perhaps he would be shaken again.\nCharlie: \"Who shook me?\" \"Grandfather William.\nWe took away the pain from Emmy the other night.'' In\nanswer to a question, they said there was nothing anta-\ngonistic in any of the party, but that Dan was not in a\ngood condition. We joined the rest again, but had no\nfurther manifestations.\nAfter we had gone to bed. Home went into a\ntrance ; for some time he spoke with difficulty. He asked\nme who certain people were. \" Who is WUloughby\nWjmne ? Who is Emily ?\n\" he then said something about\na pretty Uttle child and two Amys ; and also there was\nan uncle of mine there who used to give me apples out\nof his pocket. I asked \" Wyndham ?\n\" he said \" No,\nGoold.\" \" Francis ?\n\" I asked ;\n\" Yes,\" he said, \" Francis.\"\nHe then began to speak quite clearly, and said \" We\nwould often hke to tell you who we are, but our oppor-\ntunities of communicating are so rare and so short, that\nwe cannot generally do so. There are so many difficulties\nin the way, it is hke sending messages along wires that\nare continually breaking and getting out of order. We\ncould scarcely do anything to-night. Dan ought not to\nhave drunli a second cup of tea, or that second glass of\nsherry at dinner ; the slightest thing is sufiicient to pre-\nvent anything occurring. Ah, A has just come in\n;\nhe has come busthng into the room ;\nyou heard him.\"\nI said, \" Well, I heard a noise as if the door had been\nopened.\" \" Yes,\" he said, \"that was him ;\nyou will always\nI\n\f130 Experiences in Spiritvalism [seance\nknow Avlien A comes ; he will make a sound like that\nat the door. He is standing close to yoix now, looking\nstraight at you. He does not quite understand his\nposition yet, poor fellow. He cannot disabuse himself\nof the idea that he is going to be punished. He does not\nthink that according to the life that he led on earth\nhe ought to be in the company of those who are here in\nthe same room. He says, '\nI am going to help you out\nof a scrape, old fellow.' He has a strange regret at\nhaving left the earth ; he was in love ; he will of course\nsoon cease to regret it ; but he does not quite understand\nhimself as yet. He asked us why you had put your\nglasses there close to you ; and when we told him in\ncase he or any of us made ourselves visible to you, you\nwished to be able to use them, he coidd not understand\nthat he could possibly make himself apparent to you.\nHe was a bit of a fop ;\nfond of being neat and tidy, and\nvery careful of his hands ; he had very nice hands.\"\n{hi answer to a remarh of mine.) \" He says he has\nnothing to forgive. He has been a good deal with your\nmother ; she is fond of him ; he is very truthful. He\nis very fond of his father ; he says that his father is\nhonest in his belief, and that is more than he can say\nfor most people. Your mother and he, and all of us\nhave been consulting about you, as regards a question\nyovi promised your father that you would ask. Yow had\nbetter absolve yoiirself from that obUgation, for your\nmother would not like you to ask her about any single\nor jaarticular dogma.\n\" That religion in which God's created creatures worship\nhim in spirit and in truth, forgetful of self, and casting\naside worldly amliition, is a true religion, nor does it\nmatter by what title you choose to call it. There is\ntoo much of worldly ambition and love of power mixed\nup in rehgion.\" Home then spoke to me about some\npurely personal matters, and then for some time on the\nsubject that atonement mvist be made for all wrong done\non earth. \"Ah,\" he said, \"Many that are very high\nand mighty when with you, must become very humble\nindeed when they come to us ;\nyou would scarcely think\n\fNO. 29] With D. D.

You were\nmagnetised just now, and you heard a spirit shout.\"'\nI said, \" I am not aware that I did.\" \" You did not\nnotice it ;\nyou did not know what it was, and you did\nnot pay any attention to it ; but you heard it. The\nspirit wanted to come into the room, but he knew he\ncould not. He was not worthy to come into the pre-\nsence of those who are in the room, no one said any-\nthing to him\u2014no one rebuked him ; but he felt his own\nunworthiness, and rushed away screaming, as you would\nif suffering pain ; as you, if some one were telling you\nsome dreadful harrowing story, would cry out to stop\nthem, thus he felt what he was, and fled away. Now\nsome men would call him a devil, but he is not ; he will\ntry and make amends, and eventually all will come right.\nGod could not create what you call a devil.''\nHome then began talking about dreams. He said,\n\" You may think it a very curiovis theory, but it is\ntrue, that we are sometimes in communion witli\nyour spirits when we cannot even see your bodies.\nIn sleep, sometimes, your spirits are, as it were, nearer\nto us, more open to impression. Of course, as you all\nknow, it is the mortal body only that requu'es sleep ;\nthe spirit is always awake. Now, with you, your stomach\nis so much out of order, your digestion so hard, and in\nsuch a bad state, that any impression upon you in\nsleep takes a fleeting and painful nature.\"\n{In answer to a question.) \" Yes, you can take it with\nother medicine. Take it for a fortnight, then leave o\nfor a fortnight, then take it again, and in two months\nor so we can judge of the effect. We can only tell\nthese things by watching the effect.\" Home was then\nsilent for a short time. When he next spoke, he spoke\n\f132 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nas little Dannie Cox. He said, \" Oh ! I say ! now\nlook here (two expressions Dannie habitually used when\non earth). I Uke you to pray, it does good, and I am\nfond of you. Never you mind about that fern, you shall\nhave another one. Perhaps you will find it yet, for I\nam not sure that it is destroyed ; at any rate, never you\nmind about it ; if it is, you shall have another. Dan is\ngoing to awake now. When he has awoke, if you will go\nand sit down on his bed for a minute I will come.\"\nI did so, telling Home that I wanted to see if we should\nhave any manifestations. We heard a spirit come in and\nwalk about the room ; and perceived a hght near the\nceiUng. Little Dannie Cox then came and moved away\na pillow that Home had over his feet. He stroked and\npulled my feet, and sat on them ; and when Home\nasked him if his mother was asleep, he bounced up and\ndown on my feet, feehng just as heavy as a child of his\nage would if in the flesh. We also saw the same sort\nof Httle star we had seen at Stockton. He then said,\n\" Now, good night,\" and stood upon the foot of the bed.\nI saw him distinctly as a shadowy figure, of the same\nsize as his mortal body, with apj)arently some loose\ndrapery on. His hand was stretched out towards us\nwaving about. The hand and arm were directly between\nme and the window, and interrupted the light as palpably\nas if made of sohd flesh and bone.\nNo. 30.\n\u2014\nSeance held at Mrs. Hennings' House, at Norwood.\nPresent : Mr. Home, Mrs. Hennings, Mrs. Jencken,\nMr. Jencken, Mr. Saal, Mr. Hurt, and myself. The\npeculiarity of this seance was that the manifestations appear\nto have been conducted with a view rather to convince\nthe spirits present, than the mortals.\nMr. Saal is a medium, but has been accustomed to make\na joke of the whole thing ; and has latterly been a good\ndeal troubled and annoyed by the spirits. We had\nphysical manifestations\u2014tilting and raising of the table,\nmovements of the piano, currents of air, raps, &c., &c.\n\fNO. 30] With D. D. Home 133\nA series of messages were then delivered to Mr. Saal.\nHe was told that he should not treat spirits in a manner\nthat he would not dare to exercise towards mortals.\nGood advice was given him, and he was told to submit\nall to his reason, for it was given him for that purpose.\nSuppose, they said, a spirit were to tell you to put\nyour finger in the candle, you would be very foohsh to\ndo so ;\nyou would be burnt ; but if a spirit was to tell\nyou to do this, and then magnetize you, causing you to\nfeel that some substance, as it were, had been placed\nover your skin, you might reasonably think means had\nbeen taken to prevent your being burned, and then you\nwould be right to try. Home then went into a trance.\nHe walked about the room, opened the door, and appeared\nto welcome a number of people. He then seemed to be\nexplaining to them the different phenomena that had\noccurred in that room. He showed how the table had\nbeen raised, the piano and the furniture moved, &c.\n;\nand apparently explained the process of elongation, point-\ning to certain marks on the wall that had been made on\na previous occasion to record the height to which he\nhad attained. He then went to the fire-place ; stirred\nthe coals into ,a blaze, and seemed to recount how he\nhad handled hot embers. He sat for some time on the\nhearth, and then got up and walked about a little while,\nand taking up from the other table Glanvill's book on\nWitchcraft, he appeared distressed. He brought the book\nto me, and placed my right hand flat upon the cover,\nsupporting it himself underneath ;\nraps came upon the\nbook. He gradually withdrew his hand until the book\nwas supported by one finger only ;\nlastly, he withdrew\nthat also, and the book was suspended in the air, or\nrather adhered to my open hand. My fingers were not\nnear the edges, my hand was extended flat upon the cover ;\nI could not have grasped and retained the book in any\nway ; it simply adhered to my hand. Home seemed\npleased at this, and laughed, and turned round to the\n(to us) invisible spectators, as much as to say, \" Do you\nsee that ?\n\" He repeated this experiment, making me\nplace my left hand upon his, which he placed underneath\n\f134 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nthe book, in order, as he said, that I might feel that his\nhand left the book. When he withdrew his hand, there\nwas a space between it and the book of, I should say,\nthree inches. The book felt to me as though supported\nfrom beneath by a cushion or column of air. He then\nplaced Glanvill on Witchcraft on the table, and, leaving\nthe room, brought back with him a large volume on\nMythology, which he had taken from a perfectly dark\nlibrary ; he also brought his own book. Reminiscences in\nmy Life, and laid them both upon the table. He then\nwalked about the room, and appeared to be expostulating\nwith the spirits, then sitting down he placed the three\nbooks before him, in the form of a cross, and began\nspeaking about them. \" This,\" he said, placing his hand\non the mythological book, \" is pure Materialism ;\nthis,\"\ntouching Glanvill, \" Religion materiaUzed ; and this,\"\ntaking his own book, \" Materialism spiritualized. The\nfirst, blood to appease a God ; the second, blood to\nappease mankind ; the third, the blood of the soul to\nappease mankind. Though you boast of your civilisation,\nand though there are no longer persecutions of fire and\nblood : yet is there a moral persecution, and, in many\nrespects, your age is as dark as any. Who will dispel\nthis darkness ? Who is bold enough to take the broom\nand clear away the cobwebs ? It must come from the\nmaterial side\u2014from your side\u2014we cannot do it.\" He\nspoke for a long time, more than half an hour I should\nthink. He likened different men's ideas of God to the\ndifferent attempts we would all make to delineate the\nhighest peak of the Himalayas. \" None of you,\" he said,\n\" have seen it ;\nyou would all draw a different form and\nnone of you would be right.\"\nHe was very sarcastic about the wise men of the day,\nwho, he said, were afraid to investigate for fear of dis-\ncovering something beyond their own philosophy, and\nwhich they could not account for ; and yet, not one of\nthem could tell you why one man's hair is hght and\nanother's dark. \"You are much puzzled,\" he said, \"about\nmany things. Know that the highest angels also are\nlost in wonder and awe at many things.\" While talking.\n\fNO. 30] With D. D. Home 135\nhe appeared to become uneasy and getting up, said,\n\" There is a spirit here who will go on arguing with\nDr. Elhotson, so that he cannot attend to anything ;\nI must really interfere,\" and he walked to the other end\nof the room, where he seemed to expostulate with some one.\nComing back he said, \" Dr. Elhotson and Dr. Jencken have\ninvited a number of spirits here, they did not know\nthe nature of manifestations, and were anxious to see\nthem. Owing to circumstances not being favourable at\nfirst we failed to do what we wished and they are not\nsatisfied, we will try again now.\" He went to the fire,\npoked up the coals, and putting his hand in, drew out\na hot burning ember, about twice the size of an orange ;\nthis he carried about the room, as if to shew it to the\nspirits, and then brought it to us ; we all examined it.\nHe then put it back in the fire and showed us his hands ;\nthey were not in the least blackened or scorched, neither\ndid they smell of fire, but on the contrary of a sweet\nscent which he threw off from his fingers at us across the\ntable. Having apparently spoken to some spirit, he went\nback to the fire, and with his hand stirred the embers\ninto a flame ; then kneehng down, he placed his face right\namong the burning coals, moving it about as though\nbathing it in water. Then, getting up, he held his finger\nfor some time in the flame of the candle. Presently, he\ntook the same lump of coal he had previously handled and\ncame over to us, blowing upon it to make it brighter. He\nthen waUied slowly round the table, and said, \" I want\nto see whicli of you will be the best subject. All\n!\nAdare will be the easiest, because he has been most\nwith Dan.\" ]Mr. Jencken held out his hand, saying,\n\" Put it in mine,\" Home said, \" No no, touch it and see,\"\nhe touched it with the tip of liis finger and burnt himself.\nHome then held it within four or five inches of ]\\Ir.\nSaal's and ]\\Ir. Hurt's hands, and they could not endure\nthe heat. He came to me and said, \" Now, if you are\nnot afraid, hold out your hand ;\n\" I did so, and having\nmade two rapid passes over my hand, he placed the coal\nin it. I must have held it for half a minute, long enough\nto have burned my hand fearfully ; the coal felt scarcely\n\f136 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nwarm. Home then took it away, laughed, and seemed\nmuch pleased. As he was going back to the fire-place,\nhe suddenly turned round and said, \" Why, just fancy,\nsome of them think that only one side of the ember was\nhot.\" He told me to make a hollow of both my hands ;\nI did so, and he placed the coal in them, and then put\nboth his on the top of the coal, so that it was completely\ncovered by our four hands, and we held it there for some\ntime. Upon this occasion scarcely any heat at all could be\nperceived. After having replaced the coal in the fire, he\nwent and held his hand\u2014the fingers being extended down-\nwards\u2014about nine inches above a vase of flowers, \" You\nwill see,\" he said, \" That I can withdraw the moisture\nand scent from the flowers.\" He came over to me and\nrubbed my hands, imparting the odour of the flowers to\nthem ; his fingers were quite moist as with dew ; he also\nflipped the moisture, and with it the scent from his\nfingers to each person. He now appeared quite satisfied,\nand after speaking a little to the spirits in the room,\nopened the door and bowed them out, and then resumed\nhis seat. \" Now,\" he said, \" Do you all realise that you\nhave seen what is called a miracle, yet in reaHty it is\nno such thing. All these phenomena only shew our\nsuperior acquaintance with natural laws, and our power\nover material substances. Mankind ought to have the\nsame power over the material world in which he fives ;\nyou little know the power that is in you ; had you faith,\nyou could do things you fittle dream of.\" He spoke\nsome time in this strain, and then said, \" Dan is going\nto awake now, do not tell him what has occurred, but\nlet him wash liis hands.\" When he awoke, he was much\nexhausted, but after washing, appeared quite refreshed.\nWe examined him closely ; there was no sign\u2014not even\nthe smell\u2014of fire about him, neither was a hair of his\nhead singed.\nNo. dl-\u2014Seance.\nThe other night, having been unwell for some days,\nI went to bed very uncomfortable, and agueish ; I could\n\fNO. 31] With D. D. Home 137\nnot get warm. Home's bed was rocked about, and he\nsaid, \"I do not know who you are, but unless there is\nsome object in it, I wish you would leave off rocking\nmy bed, for it makes me dizzy. The bed left off shaking\nand a spirit spelt out \" Adah.\" She said, \" \/ am here\nand seek to do you good ; can you imagine my inexpressible\njoy, your angel mother has taken my hand in hers.\" Home\nwent into a trance, got out of bed, wrapped a fur rug\nround his middle, then warmed his hands at the fire,\nand commenced shampooing me over my chest, stomach,\nlegs and feet. He then took off my fur rug, warmed it\nat the fire, and put it on again, and made passes over\nmy head, retreating as he did so to the further side of\nthe room. He then got into bed and awoke. I fell\nasleep soon and slept soundly.\nNo. 32.\nLast night, the 11th [November, 1868], I had gone to\nbed about nine o'clock, and Home an hour later. Charlie\nWynne happening to look in, he sat down in the bedroom\nand smoked. We were talking on serious subjects, and a\nspirit joined in our conversation. Home went into a sort\nof half trance and spoke for a short time. After Charhe\nhad gone. Home had a second-sight vision. He said that\nhe saw a wonderfully beautiful flower, the stem purple, the\nleaves the purest white, the flower the deepest crimson,\nturning to purple, each colour emitting a light of the same\ntint. As he looked it changed and he said it had reference\nto what we had been talking about, namely, whether there\nwas change in the next world. It was to shew that there\nis. \" You were speculating,\" he said, \"as to whether\nspirits could visit planets. They can visit them, planet\nafter planet, star after star, world after world, through\ninfinity, through space. Without change and progression\nthey would not be happy.\" He then said, \" The tobacco\nsmoke is very bad, I was going into a deep trance, but\nthat prevented it ; I see it, not as a cloud of smoke,\nbut as material particles.\"\n\f138 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nAdARE :\n\" But it could not be helped, I could not\nhave stopped him.\"\nHome :\n\" You might, it was only false modesty, Charhe\nwould not have minded.\"\nAdARE :\n\" But if I had stopped him when I saw you\nwere going into a trance it would have been too late.\"\nHome :\n\" Yes, but you might have prevented it at\nfirst, it was at any rate very bad for you.\" Home\nwas at this time only as it were half entranced, be became\nquite entranced and said, \" Tell Dan in the morning that\na Turkish bath will be good for him.\" He then got up\nand began blowing as if to dispel the smoke, and\nagitated the window blinds also, for the same purpose.\nHe said, \" You have a stiffness about the head yet.\"\nHe got out of bed, came to me, and began rubbing and\nkneading the back of my head, and the upper part\nof my spine, occasionally extending his hand behind him,\nand obtaining some moisture upon his fingers. I thought\nat the time that he was using a phial of spirits of\ncamphor, that had been on the dressing table, but I\ndiscovered afterwards that I had been mistaken. He\nfinished by vigorously rubbing my feet and legs ; he then\ngot into bed, rubbed his own chest, legs and arms, and\nsoon after awoke.\nNo. 33.\n\u2014\nSea7ice.\nLast Sunday we had a seance at Norwood. Present :\nMajor Drayson, Mr. Collins, Mr. and Mrs. Jencken, Mrs.\nHennings, myself. Home, Charhe Wynne, and a Prussian.\nWe had strong physical manifestations, but none of the\nhigher sort, as two of the party were occupied in investi-\ngations. Charlie happened to mention to some one a\nrather curious reason that a lady of his acquaintance\nhad given for not believing in Spiritualism, namely,\nthat she had hved 50 years in the world without hearing\nof it, and that therefore it could not be true. A spirit\nsaid, \" Sht forgot that people had lived before her, and would\nin all probability live after her. Fmiunately all have 7iot\nher organism.\" .\n\fNO. 34] With D. D. Home 139\nAbout ten days ago we had a smnce at Ashley House\nwith Henry and James Gore Booth. We had good\nphysical manifestations, which I think satisfied James.\nNo. M.\u2014October 21th [1868].i\nLast night I was saying to Home, that it was curious\nmy meeting him in such an unexpected manner at Malvern,\nand wondering why it was that after having known each\nother in Paris, we should have remained entirely separated\nfor so many years. I said that there must of course be\na reason for it. \" Perhaps,\" I said, \" my mother might\nnot have liked my investigation of Spiritualism.\" Immed-\niately a spirit rapped on a table by my bedside, \" Yes,\"\nmeaning that she would not have approved of it. Recog-\nnizing the raps, I asked if my mother was there, and\nwas told, \" Yes.\" Home asked, \" But do you now\nobject to it 1\n\" Answer, \" No, it adds greatly to 7)ty\nJiajypiness.\" After a pause, \" My hoy ; now more than\never, 7ny own boy.\" We then heard one of the ornaments\nupon the wall being moved, and judged by the position\nof the sound that it proceeded from a benitier that was\nsuspended over Home's head ; the benitier consisted of\na flat slab of marble, with two guardian angels repre-\nsented on it, and a vessel for holy water. We heard the\nbenitier removed from the wall. My mother spelled out,\n\"\/ bless you not with water, but by the 'ptire 2)7'esence of a\nspirit ;\n\" and I then saw a hand and arm extended over\nme, between me and the hght of the window. The\nfingers were stretched out, and the hand descended\ntowards me, waving in an attitude of blessing until close\nto my face, when it disappeared. Home then said,\n\" I see my Sacha (his wife) ; she is standing near the\nfoot of the bed, and has got the benitier in her hand.\"\nI could see neither the spirit not the benitier. He said,\n\" She is bringing it over to me ; it is pressed against\nmy forehead ; she is making the sign of the cross with\n1 If this record is correctly dated, it is given out of place, for the\npreceding seances took place early in November, 1868.

I could see no\nfigure or anything supporting it. Sacha then said, \" \/\nbless you both.'' The benitier was placed on Home's bed,\nnear the foot, and left there. Home said, \" Do tell me,\nSacha, for otherwise I would not feel comfortable about\nit ; did you take down the benitier because you do not\nlike it to be there ?\n\" Answer, \" No.'' \" Do you then\nhke it ?\n\" \" Yes, because it is a symbol of guardian\nspirits \" (referring to the figures upon it). She then said,\n\"And now a fond good night\n;\n\" and my mother added,\n\" God bless you both.\"\nNo. 35.\n\u2014\nSeance.\nWe had a very pretty seance at Mr. S. C. HalFs, the\nbeginning of last week. They had just come into their\nnew house at Ashley Place. There were only Mr. and\nMrs. Hall, Home, myself and one friend present. Home\nwent into a trance, and as it were, consecrated the house.\nHe prayed most earnestly and beautifully at the threshold,\nat the hearth, at the dining table, and at Mr. Hall's\nwriting table. It was very striking. Dr. Elhotson then\nspoke for some time through Home, and said, \" I am\nwaiting for Dr. Ashburner, it will not be long before he\njoins us, and right glad I shall be when he does.\"\nNo. 36.\nLast night Home went into a trance, and spoke about\ntwo strange sj^irits that were present. \" Oh, there are a\nnumber of men here, they are standing in a ring, and are\nwriting in little books : every now and then they dash\nthem down ; but they are compelled to take them up\nand go on ;\nthey are very angry with each other, for\neach one thinks that he has found out something much to\nhis advantage, and then he is disgusted to find that the\n\fNO. 36] With D.

There is Fred Goodwin and a man\ncalled Campbell among them, and there is one who seems\nin a sort of mist, he says, '\nYou may put me down for\nwhat you please.'\n\"\nAdARE :\n\" Why they must be betting.\"\nHome :\n\" Yes, they are betting, and they must go on\nalthough they hate it. There is a regular barrier between\nyou and them, they would be disagreeable to you if they\ncame too close. It seems as though your mother had by\nher love woven a sort of net between you, so that you\nmay see how horrible it is ; but still may not be hurt\nby them.\"\nI now heard a sound as of a horse galloping in the air.\nHome :\n\" Do you hear that horse ? You will always\nknow that C D is near when you hear that noise.\nHe did not now make it himseK ; he cannot ; other\nspirits made it for him.\"\nAdARE :\n\" Will C D have to keep the company\nof these betting men ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" Yes, he will for a time, and it will be\npainful to him, for he was not by nature coarse ; all\nhis coarseness was put on for bravado.\"\nAdARE :\n\" Will he have to attend races ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" Yes, he will ; and will see all the evil, all\nthe rascality and misery resulting from them. He will\nnot wish to go there ; but he will be compelled by an\nirresistible impulse to do so until he becomes puriiied,\nand fitted for better things.\"\nAdARE : \"I hope that may not be long.\"\nHome : \"It does not appear to me that it will be\nlong ; his nature is good ; he was very kind and did\nmany good actions. Many old and poor people to whom\nhe was kind, and some of his friends also who went before\nhim, are very anxious about him, and pray earnestly for\nhim. Altogether it does not seem that it will be long.\nC D does not quite understand himself yet ; he\nis conscious, but he does not know whether he is dead\nor not. His mother is near him, and will be of use to\nhim. She > was a very worldly woman; she would be\nhigher than she is were it not for that.\" Home was\n\f142 Ex'periences in Spiritualism [seance\nthen silent for a short time, he became much agitated,\nand said, \" Oh yes, I am sure we are very much obHged\nto you indeed, are we not, Adare 1 We mortals are\nvery much obliged to you. Oh, please don't ;\nOh,\ndon't strike him ! Oh\u2014(and there came a noise in the\ncorner of the room like a blow struck)\u2014did you hear that ?\nhe hit him. Ah, they have all gone. Our mothers would\nnot let them come any nearer\u2014they have gone now\n\u2014\nthey would have been disagreeable if they had been nearer\n\u2014they were so very rude and coarse\u2014they were boxers\n\u2014\nthey made the noise hke of a horse galloping, and then\nthey said they had made a cursed row for us, and that\nwe were not thankful enough ; and they were angry.\nOne of them said, '\nCome away, and let the chaps go to\nsleep ;\n'\nbut another got very angry, and got him in a\ncorner and hit him ;\nyou heard the blow.\" Home after-\nwards said, \" Of course he could not hurt him ; all these\nthings are done to shew you that perfect individuality\nexists in the other world.\" Home soon after awoke.\nNo. 37.\n\u2014\nSeance at Ashley House, November 20th [1868].\nLast night the Master of Lindsay dined here. About\nan hour after dinner, the drawing-room being very full\nof tobacco smoke, we went and sat down at the table\nin the dining-room. Immediately we had decided mani-\nfestations. The table was strongly moved ;\nmy chair\nwas rocked about ;\nLindsay and Home heard a voice ;\nand we all heard a spirit moving about the room. We\nwere told to go back into the other room. Nothing\noccurred at the table. Home got very drowsy\u2014half\nunconscious. He said he could see the table covered with\nlight, and light coming from my hands. He said, \" How\nvery curious, I can see these words quite plain :\n'\nSome\none in a high position will commit suicide. He said he\nhad taken an overdose of medicine and drugged himself.'\n\"\nAfter a short time he roused himself, and got better, and\npresently went into a trance. He said to me, \" There\nare a great numlier of Roman Catholic spirits about you.\"\n\fNO. 37] With D. D. Home 143\nI asked if I knew any of them. \" Yes, there is one you\nknew, a priest, a very tall man. There are a great many\nof them. It is curious, they seem to be going through\nsome sort of ceremony.\" He began speaking of the\nstrange and horrible influences about the Tower (Lindsay\nis quartered at the Tower). He said, \" They are very\ndreadful, but can do no harm ;\nthey are obUged to re-\nmain at the Tower ;\nthey could not even make mani-\nfestations, were a seance to be held there. There is one\namong them, could he manifest himself, it would be by\na most horrible stench, as of corrupt flesh.\" He described\nhim as having elevated eyebrows, pointed beard, and\nwearing a ruffle. We asked if he had been a torturer,\nor anything of that sort. \" No,\" he said, \" but an\ninstigator of those things. His tools and accomplices\nhave all gone. He is left alone\u2014quite alone\u2014walking\nalways round and round.\" \" How unhappy,\" I said,\n\"he must be.\" \"Unhappy,\" he replied, \"Oh, he bears\na weight of misery upon him that would crush mountains.\nOh, those who perhaps here have worn upon their heads\na crown, when they appear before God and before His\nthrone, have to exchange it for a weight of woe upon\ntheir brows that would seem insupportable.\" He described\nseveral spirits at the Tower in most graphic language.\nAt last he appeared to see some spirit that he could not\nendiire. \" Oh ! go away ! Go away !\n\" he said, \" You\nmust go away !\n\" He sobbed convulsively ; tore open\nhis coat and waistcoat ; took ofl: his cravat and collar, and\nappeared to be sufl^ering very much. Presently he got\nbetter, and we enquired who the spirit was ; he shuddered,\nand told us not to seek to know. I asked why these\ninfluences were suffered to come about us. He said,\n\"it is good you should know that there are two sides\nto the picture, for fear that you might bring upon your-\nselves such suftering as these feel.\" He then got up ;\npulled off his boots ; took a rose from a vase, and walked\ninto the centre of the room. Presently he came close to\nme, and apparently spoke to a spirit. \" Yes,\" he said\n\" Thank you.\" Then turning to me, said, \" When\nDan went into the middle of the room, they took him\n\f144 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nby the throat, and tore this button off his shirt ;\nthey\nthrew it at you, and you heard it drop ; and then\nthey tried to throw it in the fire, but they had to bring\nit back to him.\" I asked, \" Why did he take off his\nboots ?\n\" \" Just to typify his defencelessness ; that is\nwhy he took the rose, to shew his goodwill. It is thus\nthat right overcomes wrong. Why, even if a beast were\nsuffering pain, and you went up and threatened it, you\ncould do no good ; but if you went soothingly and gently,\nthough at first it might resist, not knowing you, yet it\nwould soon become passive. Ah, the influence is all\nchanged.\" Turning to Lindsay, he said, \" You wiU have\na curious manifestation at the Tower, quite alone.\"\nLindsay asked him about it. \"I must not tell you\nanything about it. Adare, perhaps, may be informed\n;\nbut if you were, your mind would become too positive,\nand that would surely stop it.\" He got up ; walked about;\npatted me on the shoulder, saying, \" You are all right,\nyou are going to get quite well soon.\" He sat down and\nsaid, \" I see an old man with silver locks ; he has on a\nmantle, covered with stars.\" \" Who is he ?\n\" I asked.\n\" Pythagoras. He is much interested about winds and\ntides ; he has been studying the passage of the Red Sea.\nHe says it was quite a natural phenomenon, and has\noccurred three or four times before the Jews crossed,\nand once since. It is a curious circumstance, owing to\na combination of wind and of tide.\" I said, \" Was it\nobserved when it occurred since ?\n\" \" He says. No, he\nthinks not,\" Home replied, \" But when it occurs again,\nmen wiU observe it.\" \" Are we about correct as to the\nspot where the Jews crossed ?\n\" \" Oh, yes, tolerably correct.\nHe (Pythagoras) was correct in his theory, that man should\nnever wear the skins of beasts ; there is an influence\nin them that is never lost. He was right ; but he\nexaggerated. You must, for instance, wear leather for\nyour feet, the influence is so shght and so easily counter-\nacted by other influences that it does you no harm.\nCaghostro is often with Lindsay, because he takes an\ninterest in freemasonry. You may tell Dan that he\nhas not been to liim for a long time ; but he will come\n\fNO. 37] With D. D. Home 145\nagain to him. C D is very anxious to come to\nyou, but he cannot to-night. I see a woman, she repre-\nsents Fate, she has in her hand a rosebud, it contains\na worm that has eaten it to the core, she is fastening it\nto a horse\u2014the horse is galloping off\u2014oh, he looks as if\nhe must break his neck. Ah, the rosebud has fallen off\nnow. Everybody was anxious, before it was fastened to\nthe horse, to get at it, see it, and sniff at it ; but now\nthere are only two or three who have a good word to\nsay for it.\" \"Is this emblematic of C\u2014 D ?\n\"\n\" Yes it is. The same spirit is here that foretold all\nthose earthquakes and convulsions of nature, he is standing\na long way off ; but he seems anxious to say that there\nwill be a great war, or plague, or some national disaster\nof that sort before long.\" \" In Europe ?\n\" \" Yes.\" \" In\nEngland ?\n\" \" No ; it seems rather that it is to be in\nFrance.\" \"Is it a war between France and Prussia ?\n\"\n\" No ; it does not seem to be.\" Home got up, walked\nabout, sat down again, and turning to me, said\n\u2014\" The\ndoctor is pleased with you, boy.\" \" What doctor ?\n\"\nI said, \" Why, Dan's silent doctor ; he says you will\nget all right, the sooner you go away for a httle change\nthe better ; but you must not take a long journey,\nor cross the sea, it would be very foolish to do so, a\nchill might strike in again upon your stomach. He says\nthat the other night, when he rubbed the back of your\nneck, he did not make use of any hquid, as you thought.\nIf Dan's fingers had been wet, they would have felt\nrough to the skin ; but they did not.\" I said \" No ;\nthey felt oily.\" \" Exactly ; like oleaginous matter ; still\nit was in reality nothing but very strong influence. I\ncannot explain this to you, you would not understand it.\nHe saved you from very acute suffering, from violent\npain in your head ; he cut it off from your head, and\nconfined the disease to your stomach.\" Home laughed\nand said, \" Some of your relatives think that you have\nmade yourself ill by being at so many seances.'' \" What\nam I to do to dispel that idea ?\n\" \" Why, do just what\nyou are doing ;\nget well to be sure, that is the best\nthing.\" Home then awoke.\n\f146 Experiences in Spiritualism. [seance\nNo. 38.\n\u2014\nSeance.\nLast Monday we had a seance at Mr. S. C. Hall's\u2014\n\u2022\nwhich was a failure. We had scarcely any manifestations.\nAt the close, the spirits asked for a decanter of water,\nthey directed Home and the two Misses Bertolacci to\nstand up and hold their hands in a certain position above\nand below it ; and we were directed to stand round.\nThey held the decanter for some time, magnetizing it,\nand were then told by the spirits to place it upon the\ntable. The spirits said, \" Adare is to take a wiyie glass\nfull night and morning, and with the blessing of Christ, he\nwill he cured in six days.\"\nNo. 39.\n\u2014\nSeance at Ashley House, Tuesday, November 24th\n[1868].\nLast Sunday Home went to Norwood ;\nLindsay accom-\npanied him. They had a seance, but scarcely any mani-\nfestations. Lindsay came back here with Home about\neleven o'clock. We three sat round the table and had a\nvery curious seance, the room being nearly dark. Lindsay\nand Home saw spirit forms. I did not ; but I saw, as did\nalso the others, phosphorescent lights about the room ; balls\nof Hght would move along the floor and touch us, feeling\nlike a .material substance and highly electrical. Adah\nMenken was there, and spoke to us a good deal. She\nremoved her book from the table, turned a leaf down,\nand brought it back, putting it in my hand, and\ntelling me that she had marked a certain place. Little\nDannie Cox's spirit came and moved a small chair from\nthe wall, and placed it near the table. He Ufted the\nchair (no one touching it), up in the air, brought it to\nme, then carried it over the table to Home who was\nsitting at the other side. He tried to materiahse his voice\nso that we might hear it. We heard the voice distinctly,\nand he articulated the words \" Uncle Dan.\" The spirits\ngave one message in a curious way. Lindsay was anxious\nto be toiiched. They said, \" All in good\u2014\u2022\n\" and then\n\fNO. 40] With D. D. Home 147\nturning the hands of a clock that was not going, so as\nto make it tick and strike, hnislied the sentence, \" All\nin good lime.\" The table we were sitting at was twice\nraised in the air so high that we could see under it without\nstooping. It was altogether a wonderful seance. We had a\nnumber of messages, but I forget them.\nNo. 40.\n\u2014\nSeance.\nLast week Lindsay called : he said that he had had\nstrong manifestations that evening when alone, and had\nbeen told to go to Ashley Place. About 11 o'clock Home\ncame in. We sat round the table and had a most wonder-\nful seance. The room was nearly dark. We had physical\nmanifestations. Home went into a trance ; he walked\nabout the room for some time, arranging the hght, and\ntalking to himself ; he then opened the window, drawing\nthe curtains, so that we could see nothing but his head ;\nand got outside the window. This frightened us, and\nLindsay wanted to stop him, but did not. Presently,\nhe came back and told us that we had no faith whatever,\nor we would not have been alarmed for his safety.\nHe went into the next room, and we saw him pour out\nfrom a bottle on the table about half a large wine glass\nof brandy. He brought the glass back with him ; then\npartially covering himself with the window curtains, but\nholding the glass with the brandy in it above his head,\nbetween us and the window, so that we could see it,\nhe was lifted off the floor about four or five feet. While\nin the air, we saw a bright hght in the glass ;\npresently,\nhe came down and showed us that the glass was empty,\nby turning it upside down ; he also came to us and\nturned it upside down upon our hands ; then going back\nto the window, he held the glass up, and we heard the\nliquid drop into it. He began talking about the brandy,\nand said \"It is under certain circumstances a demon, and\nreal devil ; but if properly used, it is most beneficial.\"\nAs he said this the light became visible in the glass,\nand he was again raised in the air ; \" But,\" he said,\n\f148 Experiences in Spiritualism, [seance\n\" if. improperly used, it becomes so,\" (the light disappeared)\n\" and drags you down, down, lower and lower ;\n\" and as\nhe spoke he sank gradually down till he touched the floor\nwith the glass. He again raised the glass above his head\nand the liquor was withdrawn. He then told me to come\nand hold my hand above the glass ; I did so, and the\nliquor fell over and through my fingers into the glass,\ndropping from the air above me. I sat down and asked\nhim where on earth the liquor went to. \" Oh,\" he said,\n\" the spirit that is making the experiment is obliged to\nform a material substance to retain the fluid. He might\ndrink it, or hold it in his mouth ; in this case he held it in\nhis hand.\"\nAdARE : \"When you say his hand, do you mean his\nown hand, or that he created a substance like a hand to\nhold it ; was he obliged to be there to hold it, or could\nhe have been at the other side of the room ?\n\"\nHome : \"Of course he must be there ; it was his own\nhand made material for the moment to hold the hquid,\nas a hand is made material when you touch or feel it.\"\nAdARE :\n\" Then that story in Howitt's book of a spirit\ndrinking a glass of beer may be true ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" Oh, yes ;\ncertainly it may.\"\nAdARE :\n\" But could he swallow and retain it 1\n\"\nHome : (laughing) \" No, he could not retain it long,\nhe must have held the beer for a time, but it must have\nbeen spilled outside. If the doors and windows had been\nshut, so that he could not carry it out of the room, it\nmust have fallen upon the floor.\"\nAdARE :\n\" He could not then transport it through a\nsolid substance ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" Oh dear no, certainly not ! If, when the\nliquid in that glass was retained in the air, you had put\nyour hand there, it would have fallen to the ground.\"\nHe then said, \" I am going to take the strength from the\nbrandy,\" and he began making passes over the glass and\nflipping his fingers, sending a strong smell of spirit\nthrough the room ; in about five minutes he had made\nthe brandy as weak [as very weak brandy and water ; it\nscarcely tasted at all of spirit ; both Lindsay and I\n\fNO. 40] With D. D. Home 149\ntasted it, at the moment, and also some time after the\nseance was over. Home then began to walk about and\ntalked, or rather some spirit talked through him ; he\nturned and said to some spirit, \" Well, really I think\nyou had better not, we don't know you, or know any-\nthing about you ; thank you, yes, that will do quite\nwell.\" A chair then moved up to the table between\nLindsay and me, and Home said that the spirit who had\ntried the experiments with the brandy was sitting there ;\nLindsay could see him, I could not. Home, or rather a\nspirit talking through him, then began speaking about\nmanifestations to this spirit, but in such a low tone, I\ncould only now and then catch what he said. This spirit\nappeared ignorant of how to raise a substance in the air,\nand the spirit who was talking through Home seemed\nmuch amused at what he said. He tried experiments\nwith my chair, but could not succeed, and Home laughed.\nHe then began talking about lifting him (Home) up, and\nafter speaking for some time in a low tone, apparently\nsuggesting different ways, he said, \" Well, then, I will\nlift him on to the table and sling him right off into the\nair.\" \" Oh, yes,\" said the other,^ \" and perhaps break\nhis leg, that will never do.\" They then arranged that\nhe was to try by lifting him first on to the back of my\nchair. Accordingly, in about a minute. Home was hfted\nup on to the back of my chair. \" Now,\" he said, \" take\nhold of Dan's feet.\" I took both his feet in my hands,\nand away he went up into the air so high that I was\nobliged to let go his feet ; he was carried along the wall,\nbrushing past the pictures, to the opposite side of the\nroom ; he then called me over to him. I took his hand,\nand felt him aUght upon the floor ; he sat down upon\nthe sofa and laughed, saying, \" That was very badly done,\nyou knocked Dan up against the pictures.\" Home got\nup, opened the door, pulled up the bhnd and made the\nroom much hghter ; then sitting down, said, \" We will\nlift Dan up again better presently, and in a clearer hght\n1 Apparently two spirits were at this time spealviiig alternately,\nthrough Mr. Home, so as to let us know the meaning of what they were\n\u2022doing with him, and what the subject of their conversation was. :\n\f150 ExjJeriences in, Sjnritualism [seance\nso that you can sec better. Always examine well, never\nforget to use your reason in these matters.\" He was not\nhowever raised again, for some other spirits anxious to\ncommunicate came, and those who were experimentahzing\ngave way. \" Ah !\n\" Home said, \" There is an unadvanced\nspirit here ;\nyou perceive the earthy smell 1\n\" We both\nnoticed it, and asked if he had long left this world.\n\" No, only a short time.\" We then heard the noise like\nof a horse galloping, and I knew C D was there.\nI said, \" Is C D here ?\" \" Yes,\" he said \" he\nis.\" Home got up and said (C D speaking through\nhim), \" I suppose you would think me a brute because\nI ask for brandy.\" He took the glass of brandy, walked\nabout with it, and then put it down and sat down, and\nin answer to Lindsay said, \" For some years, with what-\never medium it may be, you will always know him by\nthe sound of the horse.\" Turning to me, \" You did not\ndo as much as you might for him. You might have\nadvised him and spoken to him.\" I said I was truly\nsorry ; I had not thought I could have done him any\ngood. \" Well, he thinks perhaps you might, but he is\nnot sure that you could ; but you might have tried\n;\nhe was really attached to you, and is so still. He says\nas regards all this (Spirituahsm), if you had spoken about\nit, he would have called it all damned nonsense ; that is\nwhat he would have said then. He wanted to see if\nhe could taste brandy, but the others would not let him.\"\nI said, \" Has he any desire for those things now ?\n\"\n\" Well, he never did care for brandy ; he was fonder of\nchampagne. He does sometimes think about those things,\nbut he will soon cease to do so ; his desire for them was\nproduced by bodily weakness, and when he finds himself\nsuffering no longer from that feeling, he will not want\nthem. Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow, he is crying ; he\nsays he was not what he ought to have been, but he\nwas not as bad as he has been painted. He is unhappy ;\nsomething is weighing on his mind.\" I asked questions\nand received answers, giving me much information as to\nthe cause of this spirit being unhappy. He mentioned\nfacts that I knew to be accurate, thus affording a satis-\n\fNO. 41] With D. D. Home 151\nfactory test of identity ;\nbut, it being undesirable that\nthe identity should in this case be Imown, I refrain from\nmentioning what passed. I then asked, \" Can I be of\nany use about it ?\n\" \" He says if the real person is not\nfound out, he will try and manage to impress you\u2014to\ngive you some clue ; so that without your name coming\nforward, you might be of use.\" [After a pause) \" Adare, He\nsays, that he would not come back to earth if he could ;\nhe feels that he has a better chance of improvement as\nhe is. All will come right, he says, in time ; he feels\nas if he had been ploughed and harrowed, and torn to\nbits, and may now bring forth fruits. Ah, he is off\n;\nrestless, very restless. He turns back to say, '\nAdare, I\nwould not come back if I could ; I know that aU is for\nthe best.' \" We waited in hopes of Home being hfted in\nthe air again ; but the power was expended, and he\npresently awoke, and we went into the next room. After\nLindsay had gone. Home went into a trance for a minute\nor two, and spoke to me. He said that C\n\u2014\n\u2014 D 's\ncoming had prevented them doing what they had wanted.\nHe said, \" We were in the room when Dr. Hawkesley was\ntalking to you yesterday, and we much approve of his\nsuggestions. It is the quinine that caused those un-\npleasant feehngs in your head ; there was nothing spiritual\nabout it.\"'\nNo. 41.\n\u2014\nSeance at 5, Btickinghant Gate, Wednesday,\nDecember IQth}\nOn Sunday last, Charhe Wynne and I went over to\nAshley House after dinner. There we found Home and the\n1 We reprint this heading just as it appears in the original edition,\nbut it has evidently been misprinted, as reference to the first two lines\nof Lord Dunraven's report of the sitting will show. The heading should\nrun thus : No. 41 Seance\u2014Wednesday, December 16th, 5, Buckingham\nGate. The date and place of the heading refer to the date and place\nat which Lord Dunraven's account was written (compare e.g. the heading\nto Seance No. 23, p 111) The sitting itself took place on Sunday,\nDecember 13, 1868, at Ashley House, Victoria Street. This is borne\nout by the Master of Lindsay's statement to the Committee of the\nDialectical Society in 1869, in which he speaks of \" the limitations in\n\f152 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nMaster of Lindsay. Home proposed a sitting. We accord-\ningly sat round a table in the small room. There was no\nlight in the room ; but the hght from the window was\nsufficient to enable us to distinguish each other, and to see\nthe different articles of furniture. Immediately on sitting\nVictoria Street,\" and by Lord Dunraven's present recollection, which\non this point is perfectly clear. It seems worth while to call attention\nto this mistake, for both the time and place of the sitting are of\nevidential importance in relation to the famous incident which occurred\non this occasion of Home passing from one window to another.\nThe mistake is reproduced in Podmore's account of the incident\n(see Modern Spiritualism, vol. ii. p. 255), where he refers to the sitting\nas having taken place on \" December 16th, 1868, at 5, Buckingham\nGate,\" having doubtless been misled by the wrongly printed heading.\nIn connexion with this mis-statement of Podmore's concerning the date\nof the sitting a further point is worth noting. In discussing the credi-\nbility of the witnesses to this incident Podmore points out that in a\nstatement written on July 14, 1871 (two and a half years after the\nsitting) the Master of Lindsay referred to \" the moon shining full into\nthe room,\" whereas there could only have been \" faint moonlight,\" the\nmoon being on December 16th only \" two days old.\" But, as noted\nabove, the sitting took place on December 13th, on which day, accord-\ning to a Nautical Almanack of 1868, the moon was new at 13 h. 33.2 m.,\nand could not therefore light the room however faintly !\nThe Master of Lindsay's account of the incident, written in 1871,\ndoes not seem consistent with his account given to the Committee\nof the Dialectical Society in 1869 (in which, incidentallj^ he does not\nseem to have mentioned the moon), but, as Podmore points out {op.\ncit. p. 256), this may be due to inaccurate reporting. The chief point\nof interest to note here is that in Lord Dunraven's almost contem-\nporary report there is no mention of the moon. He only says that\n\" the light from the window was sufficient to enable us to distinguish\neach other,\" a circumstance not difficult to account for when one\nremembers that there must have been some light coming in from the\nstreet outside, the curtains having been apparently undrawn.\nThe above footnote was submitted to Lord Dunraven and in reply\nthe Editor, Mrs. Salter, received from him the following letter :\n\u2014\n22, NoBFOLK Street,\nPark Lane, W.I.,\nGth May, 1924.\nDear Mes. Salter,\n... I have seen a note from Sir Oliver Lodge and your\nfootnote relating to the discrepancies connected with Seance 41, and\nI have also looked at my copy of the \" Experiences.\" The discrepancy\nis unfortunate, but it is, I think, easily explained. I frequently stayed\n\fNO. 41] With D. D. Home 153\ndown we had physical manifestations and messages, chiefly\nfrom Adah Menken. Lindsay saw two spirits on the sofa,\nand others in different places. Home went into a trance.\nAdah Menken spoke through him, to what effect I do\nnot remember ; also httle Dannie Cox. The latter having\nin speaking to Charlie Wynne called him Charlie, turned\nto me and said, \" Please tell him that we always call\npeople by their Christian names.\" Home suddenly break-\ning off in the middle of a sentence said, \" Who is this\nman, E ? What does he want ? Do you know him ?\n\"\nCharlie :\n\" Yes, I knew him, he came to me at\nLissadell, and told me a variety of circumstances connected\nwith his death.\"\nat my father's house\u20145, Buckingham Gate\u2014and Mr. Home often stayed\nthere with me. In my father's and mother's absence the house was,\nof course, shut up, and my recollection is that I and Mr. Home just\nhad bedrooms there and lived out.\nIt is plain from the context of the book that we frequently went\nfrom Buckingham Gate to attend seances at other places^ I take it\nthat the heading in the \" Experiences \" is copied from the letter which\nI wi'ote to my father from Buckingham Gate, and probably on Bucking-\nham Gate notepaper, relating to the seance which took place at Ashley\nHouse on the previous Sunday. The correct title should have been,\n\" No. 41 Seance at Ashley House, Sunday, December 13th.\" The\ndiscrepancy applies to the date as well as the address, as the title\nstates Wednesday the 16th and the context commences \" On Sunday\nlast.\"\nThere can be no doubt whatever but that the seance was held at\nAshley House on Sunday, December 13th, and that the notes con-\ncerning it were posted by me from 5, Buckingham Gate on Wednesday,\nDecember 16th. . . .\nAs to Mr. Podmore's account of the incidents, at this long distance\nof time I am unable to give any information. The Master of Lindsay,\nafterwards Lord Crawford, seems to have given his account of the\nincident two and a half years after it had happened, and states that\nthere was moonlight. As you have examined the phases of the moon\nat that date, it is obvious that he must have been mistaken as to\nthe moonlight. In my account, written immediately after the occur-\nI'ences, I only stated that the light from the window was sufficient\nfor us to chstinguish each other. I have no doubt that the Master\nof Lindsay, writing some time after, attributed the light erroneously\nto moonlight.\nYours very truly,\nDUNBAVEN\n\f154 Experiences in Spiritualism [SEANOE\nHome :\n\" He is come about that. Do you object to\nhis doing so ?\n\"\nCharlie :\n\" Certainly not ; I am glad of it.\"\nHome :\n\" Then he will sit down beside you.\"\nA chair moved of itself from the wall up to the table\nbetween Home and Charlie. Charlie said he could feel\nthat there was some one there, but he saw nothing.\nLindsay perceived the figure in the chair, and said he\nwas leaning his arm on Charhe's shoulder. The upstart\nof a long conversation between Charlie and E\u2014\u2014,\nspeaking\nthrough Home, was that he, E , would on no account\ngive any information that would lead to the prosecution\nof That Charlie had been told at Lissadell\nto let the matter alone ; that he had not given the\ninformation at Lissadell ; that other spirits very anxious\non the subject had done so ; that they had made some\nmistakes, and that owing also to the imperfect develop-\nment of the medium other mistakes had occurred. That\nsome of the information was incorrect he said could be\nproved by his writing to certain places, when he would\nfind that no person of the name given had been there.\nHe had not been allowed to discover what became of a\ncertain man after his, E 's, death. God's justice\nwas very different from man's ; and God's justice would\nfind him out. He could not and would not have anything\nto do in the matter.\nAdARE :\n\" But you do not object to human justice\ntaking its course ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" Oh dear no ; it is necessary for the well-\nbeing of society that it should do so ; in human afiairs\nlet human justice proceed ; but we cannot interfere\n;\nGod's justice is so difi^erent from man's. It is obvious\nalso that were we permitted to continually interfere in\nthese matters, the result would be extremely bad.\"\nHome became much agitated ;\n\" Ah,\" he said, \" he\nhas something weighing on his mind ;\npoor, poor fellow !\n\"\nHe laid his head upon my hand on the table and sobbed\nviolently ; two or three tears fell upon my hand.\nHome :\n\" Do you feel how hot his tears are ?\n\"\nAdare: \"Yes, I do.\"\n\fNO. 41] With D.

Poor fellow, he seems to\nwant to speak about something that has been lost.\"\nCharlie :\n\" Is it about some missing papers ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" Yes, that is it.\"\nCharlie :\n\" Can he tell me where they are ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" He says that unfortimately most of them\nwere destroyed, but some were sent to his lawyer. He\ndoes not tell me the name of his lawyer, but the family\nwill know ; he says you wiU find several among some\nreceipts and other papers in a small box over the door\nof his study ; there are two or three small boxes there.\n'\nOh !

Ah ! he has\ngone, poor fellow ; he is rather abrupt in his manner, is\nhe not ? He does not brook much delay.\" Home told me\nto go into the next room and look if the tears had left\nany mark upon my hand. I perceived a very sUght red\nmark. When I returned he told me to stretch out my\nhand. I did so, and Dannie Cox touched it with the\ntip of his finger and said, through Mr. Home, \" You will\nsee the marks plainer in the morning.\" They were rather\nplainer, but stiU indistinct, when I awoke the next day.\nHome then got up and walked about the room. He was\nboth elongated and raised in the air. He spoke in a\nwhisper, as though the spirits were arranging something.\nHe then said to us, \" Do not be afraid, and on no\naccount leave your places ;\n\" and he went out into the\npassage. Lindsay suddenly said, \" Oh, good heavens\n!\nI know what he is going to do ; it is too fearful.\"\n\f156 Ex'periences in Sjnritualism [seance\nAdare :\n\" What is it ?\n\"\nLindsay : \"I cannot tell you, it is too horrible\n!\nAdah says that I must tell you ; he is going out of\nthe window in the other room, and coming in at this\nwindow.\" We heard Home go into the next room, heard\nthe window thrown up, and presently Home appeared\nstanding upright outside our window ; he opened the\nwindow and walked in quite coolly. \" Ah,\" he said,\n\" You were good this time,\" referring to our having sat\nstill and not wished to prevent him. He sat down and\nlaughed.\nCharlie :\n\" What are you laughing at ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" We are thinking that if a pohceman had been\npassing, and had looked up and seen a man turning\nround and round along the wall in the air he would have\nbeen much astonished. Adare, shut the window in the\nnext room.\" I got up, shut the window, and in coming\nback remarked that the window was not raised a foot,\nand that I could not think how he had managed to\nsqueeze through. He arose and said, \" Come and see.\"\nI went with him ; he told me to open the window as\nit was before, I did so : he told me to stand a little\ndistance off ; he then went through the open space, head\nfirst, quite rapidly, his body being nearly horizontal and\napparently rigid. He came in again, feet foremost, and\nwe returned to the other room. It was so dark I could\nnot see clearly how he was supported outside. He did\nnot appear to grasp, or rest upon, the balustrade, but\nrather to be swung out and in. Outside each window\nis a small balcony or ledge, 19 inches deep, bounded by\nstone balustrades, 18 inches high. The balustrades of\nthe two windows are 7 feet 4 inches apart, measuring\nfrom the nearest points. A string-course, 4 inches wide,\nruns between the windows at the level of the bottom of\nthe balustrade ; and another 3 inches wide at the level of\nthe top. Between the window at which Home went out,\nand that at which he came in, the wall recedes 6 inches.\nThe rooms are on the third floor. Home presently got\nup again, told us not to be frightened or to move, and\nleft the room. Adah Menken told Lindsay that they were\n\fNO. 41] With D. D. Home 157\ngoing to shew iis the water test ; but for some reason\nor other I suppose they were unable to do so, for Home\ncame in again directly, sat down and said \" Dan must\nawake now, he will be very nervous ; but you must\nbear with him, it will pass off.\" I asked Lindsay how\nAdah had spoken to him on the three occasions. He\ncould scarcely explain ; but said it did not sound hke\nan audible human voice ; but rather as if the tones\nwere whispered or impressed inside his ear. When Home\nawoke, he was much agitated ; he said he felt as if he\nhad gone through some fearful peril, and that he had\na most horrible desire to throw himself out of the\nwindow ; he remained in a very nervous condition for\na short time, then gradually became quiet. Having\nbeen ordered not to tell him, we said nothing of\nwhat had happened. We now had a series of very\ncurious mam'festations. Lindsay and Charlie saw tongues\nor jets of flame proceeding from Home's head. We then\nall distinctly heard, as it were, a bird flying round the\nroom, whisthng and chirping, but saw nothing, except\nLindsay, who perceived an indistinct form resembling a\nbird. There then came a sound as of a great wind\nrushing through the room, we also felt the wind strongly ;\nthe moaning rushing sound was the most weird thing I\never heard. Home then got up, being in a trance, and\nspoke something in a language that none of us under-\nstood ; it may have been nonsense, but it sounded like a\nsentence in a foreign tongue. Lindsay thought he recog-\nnized some words of Russian. He then quoted the text\nabout the different gifts of the spirit, and gave us a transla-\ntion in English of what he had said in the unknown tongue.\nHe told us that CharUe had that day been discussing\nthe miracles that took place at Pentecost ; and that the\nspirits made the sound of the wind ; of the bird de-\nscending ; of the unknown tongue, and interpretation\nthereof, and the tongues of fire : to show that the same\nphenomenon could occur again. He spoke at length on\nthe folly of supposing that God had long ago written, as\nit were, one little page of revelation, and then for ever\nshut the book, and turned away his face from mankind.\n\f158 Experiences in Spirihialism, [seance\nCharlie asked questions relative to the nature of God ;\nthe doctrine of the Trinity ; and God's having once been\non earth. Home spoke at great length, and with much\neloquence. I cannot remember the exact words ; but the\nsubstance of it was, that it was impossible for us to\ncomprehend it ; that nearly every man had really in his\nmind a different idea of God ; that whether our concep-\ntion of Him was as a unity, duahty, or a trinity, it\ncould not be of much consequence, provided that we\nrecognized Him and obeyed His laws. He spoke much\nof the immensity of God, and our almost utter ignorance\nof Him and His works. He described the geometrical\nforms and attributes of a grain of sand, and asked us if\nwe understood \"^ything of that ; and then pointing to a\nstar, he asked us what we knew of that. He commented\nupon the very shght knowledge that the most scientific\nmen had ;\nmentioning that not long ago the spots on\nthe sun had been considered to be mountains ; then\nwater ; then faculae : but that now they knew them to\nbe great chasms. \" But what they do not know,\" he\nsaid, \" is, that the sun is covered with a beautiful vege-\ntation, and full of organic hfe.\"\nAdARE :\n\" Is not the sun hot ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" No, the sun is cold ; the heat is produced\nand transmitted to the earth by the rays of hght passing\nthrough various atmospheres. As to God's having been\nonce on the earth, He has never left it, but is every-\nwhere.\"\nCharhe also asked about the divinity of Christ, and said\nhe wanted to know the truth about all those matters.\nHome spoke to the effect that even if they could tell\nus the whole truth, our minds could not understand or\nbear it. He said that spirits had different views on these\nsubjects, and that they could not and might not unfold\nthe truth. \" You are taught,\" he continued, \" as much\nas you can bear. A common theory, speaking figuratively,\nis that the heavens and earth are two cones ; and that\nChrist is, as it were, the two apexes, joining and con-\nnecting both.\" He recommended Charhe, if he did or\ncould, to hold the doctrine of the divinity of Christ, in\n\fNO. 41] With D. D. Home 159\nits usually accepted form, saying that it was better for\nhim to do so, if it led him to a more religious frame of\nmind ; but added, \" Follow His teaching and carry out\nHis mission. His mission was one of Peace ; do not then\ncut your neighbour's throat because he differs from you.\"\nHome then launched out into a tirade against intolerance\nand persecution, lamenting over the wickedness of man-\nkind in supposing that bloodshed and persecution could be\npleasing to God. He spoke at great length on this subject.\nAdARE :\n\" But if, for a time at least the whole truth\nabout such important doctrines as the divinity of Christ is\nnot perceived, do not the differences of opinion among\nspirits who are much together, lead to bad results ? For\ninstance, my mother was very rehgious ; . ?nd especially\nupon that subject of the divinity of Christ. She may be\nfrequently with spirits who do not hold the same views,\nor hold them in a modified form. Do they still differ 1\nDo they talk about it ?\n\"\nHome : \"It cannot lead to dissension ;\nthey know that\nthey are not perfect, and that they have much to learn.\nThe sort of conversation you have imagined to yourself\nhas actually taken place. A spirit has asked certain\nquestions such as :\n'\nCan you shew me that there was a\nnecessity for it 1\n' '\nCan you actually prove it ?\n'\n&c.,\n&c. And your mother always, as you know, kind and\ngentle, only says, '\nNo ;\nperhaps not ; but I do not see\nany reason why I should change the behef I always held\nabout it.'\"\nHome then turned to me saying, \" You have been\nmuch troubled and disturbed ;\nyou have a difficult and\ntortuous path before you, and you have thought that if\nthere was anything in Spirituahsm it ought to be of use\nand comfort to you. We know all your doubts and\ndifficulties, and sympathize with you. Be patient and\nprayerful, and all will be well. Have you had a dream ?\n\"\nAdaee : \"I beheve I have dreamt something curious ;\nbut I am unable to remember what it was.\"\nHome :\n\" Adah has been trying to impress you in your\nsleep. Your mother allowed her to do so ; but she has\nnot quite succeeded ; she will try again. What you dreamt,\n\f160 Experiences in Spiritualism [SEAKCE\nyou could not remember, it was this : You thought you\nwere journeying along a tortuous difficult path full of\nobstacles ; at the foot of a mountain you saw two angels ;\nthe one very bright and pure,, the other rather darker\nand more earthly. You were in doubt which to choose\n;\nbut thought the darker one, being most material, would\nbe of most use. You trusted yourseH to him ; but as\nyou ascended the mountain, the path became more and\nmore difficult, and the angel that guided you became\nhimself weary and confused ; could not conduct you any\nfurther, and at last you were obliged to stop. You found\nthen still greater difficulty in retracing your steps than\nyou had experienced in going up ; but at length, you\narrived again at the foot of the ascent ; and you then\ntrusted yourself to the other and brighter angel, when\nthe road became at once easy, and he led you up with-\nout doubt or difficulty.\"\nNo. 42.\n\u2014\nSeance at No. 5, Buckingliam Gate, December 20i^.^\nMy dear Father,\u2014Last Tuesday we had a seance at\nNo. 7. Present : Home, Charhe Wynne and his wife,\nAugusta Gore, the Master of Lindsay, Arthur Smith\nBarry, and myseK. There appeared to be great difficulty\nin making manifestations ;\nindeed, the spirits said that\nHome was ill and therefore that they had no power.\nWe felt strong vibrations of the table, which was moved\nabout. Augusta's couch was moved, (no one touching it)\nas was the screen, at the head of her couch, (no one\ntoucliing it). The spirits also answered, and gave messages\nby rapping on the couch ;\naltogether it was not a bad\nseance for convincing sceptics. Arthur was touched, as\nwas also Augusta, and the latter told me afterwards, that\nshe had seen spirit-forms in the room. Home was taken\npossession of, his hands and arms became partially cata-\nleptic, and he made passes in this condition over Augusta\n1 The same mistake in the printing of tlie heading has evidently\nbeen made in this case as in the case of Stance No. 41 (see above,\np. 151 ).

We sat for a short\ntime in the httle room, and had manifestations, but Home\nwas too weak for anything very wonderful. He was\nelongated slightly (I think), and raised in the air ; his\nhead became quite luminous at the top, giving him the\nappearance of having a halo round it. When he was\nraised in the air, he waved his arms about, and in each\nhand, there came a httle globe of fire (to my eyes, blue) ;\nthe effect was very pretty ; Adah Menken and Dannie\nCox were the only two spirits that I recognized by Home's\nmanner.\nNo. 43.\n\u2014\nSeance.\nLast Friday, I went to a seance at Mrs. E 's.\nPresent : Home, H. Jencken, Mrs. E , Mrs. Honey-\nwood, Captain S , General , and myself. This\nseance was in many respects the most wonderful that I\nhave ever witnessed. Home was in a trance the greater\npart of the time ; the information that he gave was of\na very private character to Captain S ; it was given\nin pantomime, not a word being spoken, in order that\nsome of the party should not understand. Captain\nS ,\nfor whom it was intended, understood it, and I\nfancy so did I ; but as it was quite private, and for some\nreasons very fearful, I do not feel at hberty to mention\nabout it. I have since found I was mistaken. Home,\nbefore he went into the trance, said that there was a\nvery strange influence about me. He partly made him\nout, but by degrees, and said that his name (surname) was\nThomas. Thomas of some place. That he had been a\nfriend of my father's and of my grandfather, in fact a\ngreater friend of the latter than of the former ; that I\nalso had known him, that he used to have conversations\nabout rehgion with my father. He said that lie was a\nvery strange spirit, abrupt and yet undecided in his\nmanner ; \"He wants to say something to you, but when\nL\n\f162 Ex'perieMces in Spiritualism [seance\nI am going to speak he stops me.\" \" Ah !\n\" he said,\n\" He is going, he says he will come again to-night.\"\nBesides the strange story that Home in a trance acted for\nthe benefit of Captain S , he also took Captain S \u2022\nand Mrs. E (brother and sister) into another room,\nand sj)oke to them in private for some time. We had at\ndiiferent times, pretty strong physical manifestations,\ntable hfted, &c., &c. When Home was acting the story,\nit being most necessary that not a word should be\nspoken, his jaws were locked and as rigid as steel ; I\nfelt them, as did others.\nNo. 44.\nThat night I slept in Home's room at Ashley House ;\nwe had a very beautiful manifestation. Home had been\ngiving a public reading the day before at Croydon, which\nhad been a failure, and he was much dispirited about it.\nA spirit (his mother I think), said, \" Do not he cast down,\nDan ; serve God truly, and his holy spirits will guard and\nprotect you ; fulfil your mission in life, and He will not\nforsake you,\u2014be not cast down.\" We then both heard,\nas it were, a bird chirping about the room, and the\nspirit added, \" For He careth even for the sparrows.'' The\nspirits conversed with us for some httle time by raps.\nMy mother spoke more to me than she has ever done\nbefore ; Home being in a trance. He made use of the\nsame expressions my mother would have done, in a most\naffectionate manner. He talked of her happiness, partly\non account of an immunity from physical pain and\nweakness, partly owing to the blessed calm and peace of\nher existence, and her knowledge that the hearts of those\nshe had loved still beat with love for her, and that soon\nthey would all be united again together. He told me\nnot to think that it was through want of affection that\nshe so seldom communicated with me, and gave me\ncertain reasons for it, and recited two verses of beautiful\npoetry relative to a mother's love. He mentioned a\npainful peculiarity of a spirit who had taken part at the\n\fNO. 44] With D. D. Home 163\nseance that evening ; a peculiarity that I also have, and\ntold me to take warning, and try and break myself of\nit. He said that her great wish was to see me lead so\npure and elevated a life, that I might make my existence\nhere a stepping stone to a far higher state of existence\nin the next hfe. He told me not to be discouraged by\nfailure, but to strive to do what I knew was right.\nThe spirit calling himseH Thomas of (name of place\nunknown), came and began to talk about himseK. He\nsaid that since he had entered the spirit-life, he had very\nmuch changed his views on rehgion. He broke off\nsuddenly and said he would tell me all about it another\ntime. It was then late, past three a.m., and my mother\nsaid, \" I will request the other influences to leave you\n;\nyou should sleep now.\"\nNo. 45.\nLast night I slept in Home's room at Ashley House.\nI did not go to bed till past three. Soon after I was in\nbed, there were evidences of a very strong influence in\nthe room ; and we saw hghts and heard sounds, as if\nsome one was endeavouring to make their voice audible\nto us ; and we heard a sound like footsteps. We then\nhad a very beautiful manifestation. There is a plaster of\nParis crucifix, about one foot in length, hanging on the\nwall over Home's bed. We heard something being moved\non the wall, and presently saw this crucifix waving in the\nair between us and the window. I could see nothing\nholding it ; it appeared to move of itself. A spirit then\nsaid, by raps on the cross, \" It is to shew you that ive do\nnot fear the symbol of the cross ; ive should like you to\nkiss it.\" The crucifix was then brought, or, as it appeared\nto me, moved of itself, close to my face and was placed\nupon my lips. I kissed it, and it was then taken away\nto Home's bed and placed upon his hps. He did the same.\nThey then said, \" We also will now kiss it.\" The crucifix\nwas moved away some distance, and we heard a sound\nof some one kissing it three times, but saw nothing.\n\f164 Experiences in Spiritualisfrh [seance\nThey then said, through the alphabet, that they had\nsomething to tell me next Sunday ; and that the same\nspirit that had spoken to us, through Home, the Sunday\nbefore, would come again ; that we were not to interrupt\nhim by asking questions, but just to listen to what he\nsaid, as he had something of importance to tell us.\nNo. 46 Seance.\u2014Saturday, December 2^th [1868].\nLast Sunday, Home and Lindsay went down to Norwood\nto have a seance. They returned about 11 o'clock. Charhe\nWynne and Captain Smith came also to Ashley House. After\nHome and Lindsay arrived, we went into the small room\nand sat round the table ; the room was dark. We had\nstrong physical manifestations ; we were all repeatedly\ntouched by hands coming from imder the table. Our\nhands when touched were on the table. A hand took\nCharlie's hand, and the moment he felt it he exclaimed,\n\" This is F \"s hand ; I could swear to her peculiar\ntouch.\"' The same hand also touched me ;\nplajrfully\npinching and patting the back of my hand ; it felt old\nand wrinkled. A spirit said by raps, \" Yes, it is F .\"\nThe hand again toviched Charlie ; he also remarked the\nwrinkled feeling of the skin. A spirit then said, \" Yes,\nit feels to you as it once -was ; now it is 7io longer aged ;\n\"\nand a hand feeling young and soft placed itself in Charlie's\nhand, taking his in the same peculiar manner, but patting\nhim briskly as if to shew that it was full of hfe. G\nH , an uncle of Smith, and H J , told us by\nraps that they were present. I asked if it were true that\nuncle Robert was conscious of their presence near him at\nnight, and if he had real manifestations. They replied,\n\" Yes, it is true, and not imagination on his part.'' I\nasked them if Emmy had been touched on the shoulder\nthe morning before, or whether it was as I had declared,\nher imagination. They replied, \" She ivas touched.'\" Charlie\nasked if what had happened to him in clnirch was\nspiritual ? They said, \" Yes, certainly, it was.\" They\n\fNO. 46] With D. D. Home 165\nentered a good deal into our conversation. Lindsay fell\ninto a trance ; at first he could not speak, but after a\ntime in answer to a question, they said through him,\n\" Yes, he can see sometimes ; he will not remember\nanything of it, we cannot talk through him much yet, he\nis not fully developed, but he will be in time.\" Lindsay\nwhen awake saw spirit-forms, I saw lights occasionally,\nfaint flashes and sparks. Home went into a trance ;\nhe walked about the room apparently settling what was\nto be done, then sat down, and turning to me, told me\nto go into the next room, and place outside the window\na certain vase of flowers. I did so, putting the vase\noutside on the ledge, and shuttino- the window. Home\nopened the window of the room in which we were sitting.\nThe flowers were carried through the air from the window\nof the next room in at our open window. We could all\nhear the rusthng, and see the curtains moved by the\nspirit standing there, who was bringing in the flowers ;\nLindsay saw the spirit distinctly. A flower and sprig\nof fern, or something of that sort, was now given to each\nof us ; in some cases it was placed upon the hand on\nthe table ; others were touched, and on putting down\ntheir hand, the flower was placed in it. I was touched\nstrongly on the knee, and a s^Drig of box was given me.\nAfterwards, little Dannie said, \" \/ will give you another\npiece of fern in place of the one you lost ; hat you must\ntake great care of this ; it is only a very little hit.\" In\nanswer apparently to some question. Home said, \" Oh\nyes, certainly, give it to him yourself.\" Home told me\nto hold out my hand\u2014I did so, rather behind me ;\nand\nI felt Dannie's soft httle fingers touch mine, and pat my\nhand, and place a httle bit of maiden hair fern in it.\nHome then made some very curious experiments with\nflowers : he separated the scent into two portions\u2014one\nodour smelhng exactly like earth ; the other being very\nsweet. He explained what he was doing ; and how there\ncam\u00a9 to be the two j)rinciples, as it were, in the flower.\nI did not clearly understand his meaning when he spoke ;\nand I forget now what he said. While the flowers were\nbeing given to us, Home said, \" Listen ;\n\" we did, and\n\f166 Ex'periences in iSpiritualism SEANCE\nall heard the sprigs being broken in the next room.\nWhile we hstened, the sound ceased. Home said, \" You\nsee the effect of the concentration of your thoughts.\nIt is hard for you to understand ; but I assure you that\nthe fact of your all directing your thoughts to a certain\nobject there, sent a sohd column of polarized light right\nthrough into the other room, and completely changed the\ncondition of the atmosphere there for a time, so that\nthey could not continue to do what they were about.\"\nAs soon as we had all been given our httle bunches of\nleaves or flowers, Home told me to go into the next room,\nand examine the vase. I did so, and found the window\nclosed as I had left it ; I opened it and found that\nall the tall sprigs of fern, &c., &c., had been taken away.\nHome never left the room we sat in after I had placed the\nvase outside the window, so that even supposing that the\nbranches we received had been concealed by Home on\nhis person, still the sprigs in the vase must have been\nbroken off and removed somehow outside the window.\nHome now left the room, saying, \" Do not be frightened ;\nDan is not going out of the window or anything of that\nsort.\" He returned, holding in his hand haff a lemon,\nfreshly cut ; he handed it to each of us to taste. He\nlaughed and said, \" Yes, it is very good, is it not ? so\nrefreshing.\" He then held it up above his head, and\nsaid, \" We will withdraw all the acid flavour from it.\"\nA yellowish light came over the lemon ; he held it up\nfor some little time, and said, \" Now taste again.\" He\nheld it out to me ; but the room being rather dark, I\nbobbed my nose against it, and therefore tasted nothing.\nAll the others tasted it, and described it as most disagree-\nable, having no odour, and the flavour being a sort of\nmawkish alkali ; some described it as Uke magnesia ;\nothers, as hke washing soda. Home laughed and said,\n\" We will take the nasty taste away presently.\" He then\ndescribed what had taken place, I cannot recollect what\nhe said, but the substance of it was that a purely natural\nprocess had been gone through. \" li you were to eat the\nlemon,\" he said, \" or swallow the juice, the same thing\nexactly would occur by natural decomposition, all the acid\n\fNO. 46] With D.

We have done nothing miraculous ;\nby our know-\nledge of natural substances and laws, we were able to\nhasten as it were, a natural process, and withdraw at once\nthe acid, instead of its being diffused into various forms :\nwe have retained it in the air, and will now restore it to\nthe lemon.\" He held the lemon up and a rose-coloured\nflame, or rather light, came over it. After a little, he\ngave it to those who had tasted it the second time ;\nthey\nsaid that it was quite good and fresh, and that all the\nnatural scent and flavour was restored to it.^\nHome sat down and said, \" It would be very nice if\nthe same party that are here to-night, could sit occasion-\nally together. You are all sympathetic, and in a very\nshort time you would all of you see not only sparks and\nflashes of hght, but the whole forms distinctly of the\nspirits in the room.

We sat at a large square tea\ntable, one side of it being placed against Augusta's couch.\nAlmost immediately on sitting down, we felt a strong\nvibration of the table. The alphabet w^as called for, and\nthe following long message given ;\nthe first part having\nreference to me and something that had occupied my\nmind ; the latter part intended for all of us : \"A perfect\nsubmission to the crosses of earth life only worhs out for you\na purer and higher life, ivhen freed from the mortal and\nnearer the divine. You, my darling boy, did not observe that\nthe little branch we gave you last night ivas in form a cross.\nIt has a deep significance. There are six leaves at every\npoint ; these, too, have a meaning, tohich you ivill one day\nunderstand. Meanwhile, hear all ; God's truth ^vill overcome\nerror. Be patient, my darlings ; I am indeed happy that\nyou have been led to investigate.''\nWe had all the usual physical phenomena, though not\nvery strongly ;\nthe chief feature of the seance being the\namount of conversation carried on through the alphabet\n;\nand by spirits assenting or differing from what we said by\nrapping \" Yes \" or \" No \" upon the table, furniture, &c.\nRaps came on Augusta's couch, and it was moved about,\nand the head part raised a little. After these manifesta-\ntions a message was given : \"Darling, this is G H ;\"\nand immediately afterwards :\n\" We all wish to see you thus,\"\nand her couch was again raised at the head, completing\nthe sentence :\n\" We all ivish to see you thus raised up.\"\n\fNO. 47] With D. D. Home 109\nThe table moved about, and was tilted up sometimes to\none side, and sometimes to another. A whistle that was\non the table did not move when the table was tilted in\nany direction, except towards Augusta ; when it was tilted\ntowards her the whistle rolled. In answer to a question\nas to the cause of this, they said, \" From a loant of\ninjluence on that side.\" They told us they did not with-\ndraw any influence from Augusta, as it would weaken her.\nThey afterwards turned the table round, so as to have the\nside at which Emmy had been sitting next Augusta ; the\nside which had been next to Augusta came opposite to\nHome. This equalized the magnetic influence round the\ntable. At the same time we were told that they were\ndesirous of showing their presence by messages rather than\nby physical manifestations. The table was raised in the\nair about 18 inches, and remained poised for some little\ntime. Emmy's dress was pulled and shaken ; Home's\nchair was moved. Having been told, through the alpha-\nbet, to put the white cloth on the table, we did so. We\nsaw, and were touched by hands moving under the cloth.\nA flower in Home's button-hole was taken away, and\ncarried underneath the table ; I heard it moving there.\nPresently the same iiower was thrown from behind Aug-\nusta's couch ; it touched her face, and then fell upon the\nfloor. It was taken up, and a hand and arm came from\nbehind her couch, and placed it gently against her cheek,\nand gave it to her. Emmy said, \" I saw the hand and\narm.\" A message was given \" A hand, ivith the flower\nfrom K .\" Home also saw the arm ; I did not. Some\nother manifestations were made about Augusta's couch, and\nthe words, \" It was G H ,\" given. We then heard\na sharp noise that we took to be the chirping of a bird\nunder the table, and we heard something moving under-\nneath the table. The message was given\n\u2014\" We hope soon\nyou toill not require * * * ;\n\" and at the same moment a\nheavy handle, used for winding up the couch, was raised\nfrom under the table, and placed in Augusta's hand, im-\nplying that they hoped soon she would be able to raise\nherseK. The name \" G H \" was given to show\nwho had made the manifestation. We found that the\n\f170 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nchirping sound we had heard was caused by the handle of\nthe lever turning while being moved under the table. This\nchirping was imitated exactly by a spirit at some distance\nbehind us in the centre of the room. We now had a very\nwonderful manifestation. We were merry about something\nor other, and we all distinctly heard a spirit voice joining\nin our laughter ; it sounded quite clear and loud. Home\nasked if it was to shew that they hked to see us happy\nand were happy themselves ; the answer was \" Yes ; God\nis so good.\" Soon after this the message was given\n\u2014\n\" Daniel is exhausted ;\n\" and all manifestations ceased.\nDuring the seance Emmy and Augusta saw shadowy forms,\nhands, and arms.\nAfter talking a short time we went into the next room\n(Uncle Robert's study). We were at supper eating, drink-\ning, and chatting very merrily, not talking of, or I beheve\nthinking about. Spiritualism, when there came a knock at\nthe door. Charlie turned his head, and said, \" Come in.\"\nThe door did not open ; but the next moment there came\nknocks upon the table and a chair gUded out from the\nwall to the table (no one touching it), and placed itself in\nthe most natural manner between Emmy and Home ; it\nthen moved up close to Home, and the alphabet was called\nfor by the chair tilting (no one touching it). The follow-\ning message was given\n\u2014\" \/ like you because you do good\nto those I love.\" Home asked who the spirit was ;\n\"(7\u2014\u2014\n-\nH\u2014 \" was answered. Emmy's dress was pulled, and\ndragged strongly under the table, and a hand was twice\nput into hers beneath the table. Charhe was touched on\nthe knee. Several questions were answered and another\nmessage, which I forget, was given by raps on the table,\nas loud as if some one had struck it underneath with a\nhammer. The table was moved and tilted, and once raised\ncompletely off the ground for a second or two, so slightly\nthat I did not perceive it, but the others did, and the\nspirits afterwards said that it had been off the ground. It\nmust have required great power even to move and tilt it,\nfor the table was a heavy dining-room table covered with\nplates, dishes, and decanters. Home was told that Aug-\nusta had also had manifestations ; and when we returned\n\fNO. 48] With D. D. Home 171\nto the other room, we found that she had heard raps in\nher room, while we were at supper in the other. She also\nheard the raps and the movement of the table in the\nstudy.\nNo. 4:8.~Fehruary 8th, 1869.\nLast night I slept at Ashley House. Home was at a\nparty, and did not come in until very late. Soon after\nhe had gone to bed he went into a trance for a short\ntime. He was far from well, and the spirits said they\ncould not make any use of him. In the morning, about\n11 o'clock, Sacha, Home's wife, said to me, through the\nalphabet, \" Will you from my part give to Florence some-\nthing ? \" I said I should be deUghted. She said to Home,\n\" Dannie, my broad gold Bussian bracelet.''\nNo. 49 Seance.\u2014February 9th [1869].\nIn the evening of the 8th, Dr. Gully came in. As we\nwere sitting by the fire talking, Home went gradually into\na trance. He examined Dr. Gully's heart, gave him some\ndirections as to treatment, and told him that his head and\nbrain were all working beautifully ; that his head had not\nbeen so clear and in such good order for some time. He\nwalked about the room conversing, sometimes with us,\nsometimes with the spirits in the room. He asked me to\nfetch an accordion from IVIr. S. C. Hall's rooms ; I did so.\nHe then said that Captain Smith was coming, and that he\nhad just then left his house. He became rather impatient\nat his not coming quicker ; he was aware when he did\narrive, and told me to go out and meet him, which I did,\ninforming him that Home was in a trance. When Smith\nentered. Home introduced him in a quaint style. Taking\nDr. Gully's hand, he said, \" This is James\u2014James Gully ;\nand this is Wilham\u2014Wilham Smith. You are to shake\nhands. They call him a doctor \u2014there is some sense in\nthat ; and they call you a captain, which means nothing\nat all.\".\n\f172 Experiences in Sjnritualism [seance\nHome aaid to me, \" Turn off some of the gas, it is too\nheavy on Dan's brain\u2014hght is a regular weight upon the\nbrain, that is why a strong Hght prevents our making\nmanifestations ; the brain of the medium cannot act. . It\nis through your brains that the atmosphere we make use\nof is thrown off. For the same reason, manifestations\noccur more readily at night, when there is an absence of\nsunhght, than in the daytime. From a similar cause, a\nstrong hght upon the platform, as at Miss Hardinge's\nlectures that you were speaking of this afternoon is very\nbad. Light is a ponderable substance. There is much\nthat scientific men do not yet know about the nature of\nhght ;\nthere is a material natural hght, and a spiritual\nlight. When men know all about material hght, they will\nthen turn their attention to the much greater subject of\nspiritual light. Everything has its light.\" We now, at\nHome's recjuest, went into the next room and sat round\nthe table ;\nthe room was dark with the exception of the\nhght from the window. Home had that morning given\nme the bracelet as a present from his wife to Florence ;\n\u2014\nI had left it in the drawing room.\nAfter we were seated in the small room, the attention\nof the spirits appeared principally directed to Dr. Gully.\nHome explained something to him about the muscles of\nhis left side, and they gave him several strong electric\nshocks. Home seemed much pleased at this. \" Oh,\" he\nsaid, \" that was so beautifully done, they managed it so\nwell, and it has answered admirably, and done you a great\ndeal of good.\" Dr. Gully had also some messages from\nhis daughter. I then felt that some one was standing\nnear me, and I heard something moving about my head,\nand presently felt a substance brushed across my hair, and\nthen placed upon my head. I asked if I might put up\nmy hand and take it. Home said, \" Wait a moment.\"\nThe substance was then taken from ofi my head and\npassed across my hands on the table ; and finally I dis-\ntinctly felt a hand place the bracelet given to Florence\nby Sacha into my fingers. The hand pressed and patted\nmy fingers. Sacha, speaking through Home, then addressed\na few most touching and approjoriate words to me, on the\n\fNO. 49] With D. D. Hwne 173\nsubject of marriage ; after which we all heard a spirit\nmove from beside me over to the window. Home got up,\nplaced himself close to the window and said, \" Sacha will\ntry and make herself visible to you.\" Her form gradually\nbecame apparent to us ; she moved close to Home and\nkissed him. She stood beside him against the window\nintercepting the light as a solid body, and appeared fully\nas material as Home himself, no one could have told which\nwas the mortal body and which was the spirit. It was\ntoo dark, however, to distinguish features ; I could see that\nshe had her full face turned towards us, and that either\nher hair was parted in the middle, and flowed down over\nher shoulders, or that she had on what appeared to be a\nveil. She said, through Home, that she would try and\nappear to us as white light, and she did so, but the form\nwas not nearly so distinct as when she stood as a dark\nsubstance against the window. Captain Smith asked me\nhad I not intended to have been travelhng that night ;\nI told him that such was my original intention, but that\nI had changed my plans some days ago. He said, \" I\nknow that, but it was not intended that you should travel\nto-night. I have no idea why you were prevented, but\nsome day probably you will know. I was obliged (by his\nhand being taken possession of) the other day, to write\ndown some questions ; I sealed them up and sent them to\nDan ; some day you are to open and answer them, I think\nyou will find something in them about it ; I have no idea\nwhat I wrote.\" Home also told me later that the spirits\nhad not wished me to travel that night. Smith began\ntalking to me about the seance in which the lemon was\nused, and said that he had been thinking deeply over it,\nand beheved that there was an allegorical meaning attached\nto it. Home said, \" Yes, there is, and in many things\nthat we do, we frequently symbolise ; and are content to\nknow that you will, by thinking for yourselves, find out\nthe meaning : it is better so. We sometimes also do things\nthe meaning or object of which we ourselves do not know ;\nwe have our impulses the same as you. What meaning\ndo you attach to the story of the lemon ?\n\"\nSmith : \"I consider the lemon to have represented\n\f174 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nhuman nature, and the yellow flame that surrounded it\nour evil passions. The yellow flame devoured and des-\ntroyed all that was good in the lemon\u2014the juice and the\nfragrance, representing all that is good in human nature ;\nand it left the lemon vile and worthless. The red flame\nthat then covered the lemon and restored it to its former\nexcellence represented the Holy Spirit of God, by which\nalone our human nature, debased and destroyed by evil\npassions, can be restored to its natural purity and beauty.\"\nHome appeared much pleased, and said, \" Yes, you have\nread the parable aright : the yellow flame was the fire of\nevil passions, and the pure bright red flame was the Spirit\nof God.\" He then talked about the various colours in,\nand virtues of, different crystals, diamonds, rubies, sap-\nphires, emeralds, &c., and what they symbohzed. Adah\nMenken came and said through Home, \" Many would think\nit horrible of such a one as I am to come to you now\n;\nbut you, I know, think otherwise about me, and I must\nspeak a word to you relative to the very important step\nyou are about to take.\" She spoke a little about my\nmarriage, and said, \" I will come again to-night ; I want\nto have a long chat with you, and tell you some curious\nthings that occurred at Adare.\" When Home awoke he\nwas rather astonished to find himself sitting in the small\nroom, and Smith one of the part3^ He was entranced for\nnearly two hours, and was much exhausted. After the\nothers had gone, my mother spoke to me through the\nalphabet about my intended marriage. She also spoke\nabout Home going to Adare, one message I remember\nbeing :\n\" Mortals seek for knoivledge ; but when we give them\nthe fruit of our studies, if it does not coincide with their\npreconceived ideas, we are classed as devils.\" Home was so\nweak that she could not make much use of him, and Adah\nMenken could not say anything that she had intended. The\nlast message was :\n\" Dan, you are very weak ; you must not\nsit for at least a week. We take away all power from you\nfor that time.\" I forgot to say that on Monday night\nHome spoke in a trance to me about the difficulties in the\nway of mediumship and communicating. As well as I can\nremember, he said :\n\" Very strange occurrences often take\n\fNO. 49] With D. D. Home 175\nplace with undeveloped mediums ; and you are naturally\nmuch puzzled by them. These things are allowed some-\ntimes as wholesome trials, in order that the person may\nsee how necessary it is to use judgment and reason, and\nto approach the subject with the greatest care. Medium-\nship is of very slow growth ;\npeople are too hasty, and\nexpect to get everything at once. They are often also\ntold things to make them persevere, spirits are so anxious\nto communicate, and it is such a joy to find people to\ncommunicate through, that they rush in, as it were, and\ntry to encourage the medium by promises that apply\nrather to mediums in general, than to any one individ-\nually ;\npromises also which may take years in their fulfil-\nment, instead of days, as mortals in their impatience\nsuppose. You think too much of the individuality of\nmediumship. Supposing a person is told that he is to be\na great healer, that he is to go forth teaching the nations,\nand to be as a king among men ; that person would con-\nsider it all as applying solely to himself : it apphes rather\nto the whole subject, to all mecUums. Mediums should\nbe as kings, in the true sense of the word ;\nthey have a\nwonderful gift, a weighty responsibihty, and they should,\nif possible, set themselves apart, and lead pure, simple,\nunworldly fives, that they may use their gift to the best\nadvantage. This mistake as regards promises, viz. : sup-\nposing them to apply to a single individual instead of to\nmediums in general, is an important fact, bear it in mind.\nThe discerning of spirits is important. Now if a dark,\ncold, low spirit came into the room Dan would know him\nand he could not stay ; he would feel mean and out of\nplace, and would have to go. Another person might not\nperceive what he was\u2014to use a homely simile, it is some-\nthing fike a man making faces at you belund your back ;\nhe would not do so if he knew there was a mirror in\nwinch you could see him ; when St. Paul spoke of dis-\ncerning spirits, he did not mean seeing them only, but\ndiscerning the differences between them, judging between\nthe pure and the impure. Living in any way in an\natmosphere of deceit, holding seances on the sly, and\nhaving anything whatever underhand about it, is very bad\n\f176 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nand is certain to produce a bad influence. Mediums while\nbeing developed must be yqxj cautious, very prayerful,\nvery guarded against deceit ;\nvery patient, humble, and\nquietly receptive of what may come to them ;\nvery careful\nand pure in life, for a calm and prayerful state of mind\nis necessary for the influx of a high spiritual influence,\nwhile lower influences can more easily impress themselves\n\u2014are more in their element, as it were, with natures more\ndisturbed, and less exalted and pure in mind and body.\nIf those who are being developed as mediums will remem-\nber and act up to this, they will arrive at a state in\nwhich the}^ will know at once the pure from the impure,\nand be able to judge of the influences about them.\"\n[The following seances occurred at Adare Manor, and at\nGarinish, a cottage of my father's, on the coast of Kerry.\nFor the sake of uniformity, I think it best to follow the\nsame famihar style, using the first person, as in the pre-\nvious communications. The seances recorded by my father\nare signed \" D.\" ; those by me, \" A.\"^]\nNo. 50.\n\u2014\nSeance at Adare Manor, February 21th, 1869.\nMr. Home arrived yesterday, and this evening our first\nseance took place.

During\nthe seance there was a strong gale of wind, with heavy\nhail showers, and flashes of lightning. After a short time,\nvibrations and slight movements of the table occurred.\nPresently Mr. Home and Adare went to the end of the\nroom, and sat at a small table and asked what had best\nbe done. They received the following answer :\n\" The ex-\nternal atmosphere is not good. We are not sure that this\nroom ivill he conducive.

Raps\nwere heard, and JMr. Home soon went into a trance, and\nimmediately rose up and walked about the room, seemingly\nin an uncomfortable state ; his e3^es were shut. He took\nthe green shade off my reading lamp, and then bandaged\nhis eyes ;\nand after a few turns about the room, he came\nback to the table. He seemed attracted to Lawless. He\nplaced his hand against the back of Lawless's neck, and\npressed it. Lawless felt a sensation as if a hot stream\nflowed into him. Mr. Home then sat down ;\nand, pointing\nemphatically at Lawless, said :\n'\u2022'\nYou have considerable\npowers ;\nyou have (or ought to have) large healing powers.\"\nHe again walked about, and seemed very uncomfortable,\nconveying the impression that there was something un-\nsatisfactory about the state of the room. He said :\n''\nThe\ngallery is too large, and full of different influences, the\nchairs even have different influences ; and then this room\nis too full of business and of figures.\" He went out into\nthe hall ;\ncame back, and then went into the vestibule.\nOn returning he took Adare out, and asked him to come\nand try the dining room. Adare said :\n\" Why not try the\nroom at the end of the passage ?\n\" (his mother's sitting\nroom). They went down in the dark, Mr. Home finding\nthe door, which Adare missed. They entered the room,\nand immediately INIr. Home said: \"This is the room.\"\nHe then quitted it, returned to where we were sitting, and\ntaking me by the hand, he led the way rapidly back to\nthe other room, and walked into the middle of it, Adare\ncoming with us. It was pitch dark. '\u2022\nThis,\" he said,\n\u2022'\nthis is the room.\" We heard raps in different places.\nHe then took my hand, returned to my study, and sat\ndown. He addressed me in a loud whisper :\n\" That is the\nroom ; you will put some flowers there in the morning,\nand have a fire in the afternoon. There will be a remark-\n\f178 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nable manifestation up stairs ;\nyou will not know when it\nwill happen. You may go to that old ruin on Wednesday\nnight, or not later than Thursday. The men only are to\ngo, the ladies would be frightened.^ When Daniel comes\nback, go and sit up stairs.\" Mr. Home soon after awoke.\nAt one time during his trance he was either elongated or\nraised off the ground, for, while standing close to the\ntable, opposite to me, his head and the upper part of his\nfigure were rapidly elevated several inches ; the lower part\nwas concealed by the table ; this lasted only a few\nseconds.\nAs directed we went up stairs, and sat at the large\ntable in the middle of the gallery. Miss Smith joined the\ncircle ; she became slightly hysterical and left the table,\nbut soon returned. Fred Lawless became nearly similarly\naffected. Vibrations of the tables and chairs occurred, and\nthe usual cold currents of air w^ere perceived. Mr. Home\nand Adare felt some strong influence between them ; the\nchair of the former was pulled back from one to two feet,\nand Mrs. Wynne's was half turned round. The table was\ntilted in different directions, and was at last raised about\none foot off the ground. After this nothing more occurred.\nD.\nNo. 51 Seance.\u2014February 28th [1869].\nAs directed last night, we sat in Lady Dunraven's sitting\nroom. Present : Mrs. Wynne, C. Wynne, Lawless, Adare,\nMr. Home and myseff. The table was unsteady and creaky\n;\nwe had very shght manifestations. After some time Mr.\nHome went into a trance ; he seemed uncomfortable, and\nwalked about, altering the position of the different chairs\nand articles of furniture ; he objected to the large stuffed\nchairs on which we were sitting, and changed them :\nsaying, that the springs in them had a bad effect. He\ndrew down the blinds, and made movements with his\nhands and arms as if magnetizing about the room. He\nsat down near the fire, then taking out a coal, partly red\n1 We had been previously talking about going to the Abbey.\n\fNO. 51] With D. D. Home 179\nand partly black, he brought it and held it between Mrs.\nWynne and me, as if showing it to us ;\nthen, without\nmaking any remark, he put it back in the fire. He held\nthe coal by the black part, which, doubtless, was tolerably\nhot ;\nyet, still the experiment could hardly be called an\nexample of the fire test, such as was exhibited at Nor-\nwood, and is mentioned in No. 30. After this he rubbed\nand patted several of us on the back, and he pressed his\nhead against me between the shoulders ; I felt a warm\ncurrent flowing from it. He then sat down, and said that\nthe room was now in a much better state. After making\na few observations he awoke. Raps were heard, and we\nwere told to go and look for another table ; Mr. Home,\nin order to know who should go with him, pointed to\neach in turn, and Adare and I were chosen. We went to\nthe hall and the library, trying different tables without\nany result ; on our return through the hall, we heard raps\non a table as we were touching it, as we passed ; so we\ntook it with us. We sat at this table ; but had only\nsUght manifestations. We received this message, \" We are\ndoing our best ; we hope you will be patient.''' We asked,\n\" How many spirits present ?\n\" and were told \" Nine.'\"\n\"How many that we have known?\"' \"Two.\" I ex-\npressed a hope that Dr. EUiotson would come, and we\nwere talking about him when the following was given,\n\" He will visit the Abbey.'\" After a short pause we re-\nceived this message :\n\" The influence is against us ; we\nmean the external atmosphere.\" And soon after the follow-\ning :\n\" We think you had better try the same table you had\nlast night.\" Upon this we adjourned to the gallery. We\nwere joined by Miss Wjrmie, Miss Smith and Major Black-\nburn. The table vibrated, and raps were heard ; but\nnothing remarkable took place.\nDuring one of the periods when the table was vibrating,\nthe manor clock struck twelve ; the continuity of the\nvibration ceased, but at each stroke of the bell a vibration\ntook place. When the last stroke had sounded, the con-\ntinuity of the vibrations recommenced. Soon after this,\nthe following message was given :\n\" We have done our best\n;\nbut find it is impossible. May God bless you all.\" The\n\f180 Ex'periences in Spiritualism [seanoe\nword God was spelled by strong vibrations of the table ;\nwe then adjourned. D.\nNo. 52.\u2014Seance, March 1st [1869].\nWe had a seance at five p.m. Present : Major and Mrs.\nBlackburn, Mrs. Wynne, Miss Wynne, Miss Smith, Captain\nWynne, Mr. Lawless, Home, and myself. Tolerably strong\nphysical manifestations occurred. No messages were given,\nbut the spirits present occasionally joined in our conver-\nsation by rapping \" Yes \" or \" No ;\n\" and they answered\na few questions as to the number of spirits in the room,\nwhose relatives they were, &c., &c.. The table at which\nwe were seated was moved, and raised in the air. A\ngood-sized table standing at some little distance behind\nHome moved of itself ; and a chair behind me moved up\nto me of itself. Some one asked, \" How many spirits are\nthere present ?\n\" Twenty raps were given. Miss Smith,\nhaving been requested to do so, asked if any of her re-\nlations were in the room. ''Yes;'' was answered. \"But,\"\nshe said, \" there are no relations of mine alive here ; no\none is related to me.\" The answer was \" We are the\nliving.\" When leaving the room, Home told me he had\na strong impression that Mrs. Wynne and myself were to\nsit with him alone sometime in the evening ; after dinner,\naccordingly, we three went and sat in my room round a\nlarge and tolerably heavy table. Immediately the in-\nfluence became apparent by strong vibrations and raps on\nthe table and floor. The room was at this time lighted\nby a bright fire and one candle. The following sentences\nwere given with short intervals between them, there not\nbeing apparently sufficient power to enable the spirits to\nspell out by raps many words in succession : \"We are\npleased to have you thus.'' \" Alone ?\n\" I asked.* \" Yes.\"\n\" Emily ivelcome.\" Home's hands were influenced, and he\npatted and stroked his chest.\nThe names were then given: \"Richard,\" \"James,\"\n\" John,\" \" Robert.\" \" Is it Gore Booth ?\n\" I asked. \" No.\"\nWe were speculating as to who these spirits could be, as\n\fNO. 52] With D. D. Home 181\nonly one name was recognized by Mrs. Wynne, and none\nby me, Home began describing them ; but Mrs. Wynne,\nnot knowing that it was of any consequence, interrupted\nhim, and he could not tell us who they were ; he said\nhowever that we should know later. We now heard\npersons moving in different parts of the room. In order\nto be certain that we were not deceived, we asked that\nthe sounds might be repeated three times ; it was done as\nwe requested. Home also said he saw various figures, but\nnot with sufficient distinctness to be able to describe them.\nRaps were constantly heard on the table, floor, and furni-\nture, and the spirits occasionally answered our questions.\nThe table was moved about shghtly, and raised off the\nground. Home went into a trance, got up and walked\nabout without speaking for some httle time ;\nby the atti-\ntude he assumed I perceived that \" the Doctor \" was\ninfluencing him. He came up to me and whispered, \" Tell\nDan not to eat so much sweet.\" Another influence then\ncame over him ; he walked about briskly, and seemed\nhappy and pleased ; he spoke in a loud voice somewhat\nto this effect : \"As regards the seances you have been\nholding, it is most difficult for us to succeed. In the\nfirst place the external atmosphere is most unpropitious,\nneither have you approached the subject in a proper spirit\nand frame of mind. In whatever way you regard the\nsubject, it is a most important one, and should not be\ntreated with levity, but should be approached quietly and\nwith earnest prayer. You are not sufficiently serious.\nSome are actuated by curiosity, some are wishing for one\nthing, others for something quite different ; the aspirations\nare so various, it is almost as though you were praying\nto different gods : the influences are consequently all\nopposed to each other. You should come prayerfully,\nearnestly, not hoping for, or expecting, anything in par-\nticular ; above all without levity. It is a solemn subject\nif you consider it to be a great discovery, calculated to\nthrow light on hitherto hidden subjects, to overthrow\nmany errors, and to be of great benefit to the human\nrace. If you do not believe that we are what we pretend\nto be, and even consider us to be evil, still it is a subject\n\f182 Experiences in S'piritualism [seance\nto be treated with solemnity, for you are communicating\nwith beings or intelhgences external to yourselves, difierent\nfrom you, and beyond your knowledge or control. The\nexternal influences also are very numerous and strange,\nand are all, as it were, touching and fingering Dan\n\u2014\nwondering at him. It is quite new to them ;\nthey have\nnever seen anything like it before, and they do not under-\nstand it. Some of them are so intensely anxious to\ncommunicate, to say something, others again do not at all\napprove of it, and would wish to prevent anything of the\nsort.\"\nAdARE :\n\" That is curious !\n\"\nMrs. Wynne :\n\" Surely it would be more curious if they\nwere all agreed.\"\nHome : (laughing) \" Why, Adare, your aunt's notions\nare more correct than yours, although you have been at\nit so long ; but then you spoke without thinking. Oh\nyes, indeed, some of them are very much opposed to it.\"\nAdare :\n\" Will you give us any directions about our\nseances ?\n\"\nHome :\n\" That is what we have been trying to find out,\nbut it is difficult. You see if we pick out a few, then\nthose who are left out are annoyed, and those who are\nchosen are sorry for the others who are disappointed, and\nare affected by their influence. It would be much better\nif you would settle among yourselves for some to sit one\nnight and the others the next ; we can tell you what\ncombination answers best ; we would sooner you settled it\namong yourselves, then there will be no unpleasant feehng.\"\nHome then put out the candle, and told me to help him\nto move the table ; we placed it near the window and\nsat down. Soon after he awoke. There was a strong\ninfluence about the table, it vibrated and was hfted in\nthe air, the cloth was raised apparently by hands moving\nunder it, and I was touched on the knee by a hand\n;\nHome said he saw hands and figures. A hand came out\nfrom under the table, covered by the cloth and touched\nmy left side, it remained there a few seconds and was\nthen withdrawn. This message was given, \" \/ took it from\n7ny oivn dear boy to give to you my dear sister, take it.\"\n\fNO. 52] With D. D. Home 183\nWe none of us understood to what this referred, till I\nnoticed that a rose bud had been taken from my button-\nhole, however I made no remark. We heard something-\nmoving under the table, and the cloth was raised, as if\nby a hand, near ]\\'Irs. Wynne. At Home's suggestion, she\nput her hand down, and the rose was placed in it. A\nflower in Home's button-hole was then jerked out across\nthe table, and fell by me. I asked who it was for, the\nanswer was, \" For you to give to your father with love.\"\nThis message was then given, \" Your happiness is ours.''\nThen this, \" We ivould fain manifest ourselves more power-\nfully.\"\nWhile this last message was being given, the table was\nraised gently off the floor and moved up and down three\ntimes in the air, then raised again a Httle higher, and\nagain moved up and down ; in this mamier it was, without\never touching the floor, raised six or seven times, a little\nhigher on each occasion, until it was about three feet\nabove the floor. I have never seen a table sustained in\nthe air for so long a time. Mrs. Wynne remarked that\nit was dehghtful to have no bad influence present, when\nwe had this message :\n\" Prayer to God will protect.\" The\ntable then began moving on the floor in a circle, and the\nfollowing was given :\n\" The love of God encircling you round\nand about.\" Subsequently this was spelled out :\n\" We love\nthe symbol of faith ;\n\" and the table was raised in the air,\nand twice made the sign of the cross. A perfume, as of\ndried rose leaves and some aromatic substance, was wafted\nacross us and the message given :\n\" We must now go.\"\nNothing more occurred. A.\nNo. 5^.\u2014Tuesday, March 2nd [1869].\nOn the afternoon of the 2nd I was seated by the fire\nin my room reading, Home was writing at the long table.\nSuddenly the round table, starting from the window, moved\na distance of six or eight feet, and placed itself against\nthe end of the long table. We both heard a sound as of\na bell tinkUng. Home began speaking about the spirit\n\f184 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\npresent, and while doing so went into a trance. He said,\n\" Oh, he is very strange and restless, he is a monk.\"\nI asked, \" Is that sound of the bell the same as I heard\nlast night ?\n\" \" Yes ; he was here last night, and says you\nought to have heard him. He has never been here before,\nthat is, not since this house has been built. The sound\nof the bell is the same also as you heard outside the\nhouse to-day with Dan, only it is more concentrated now.\"\nI asked what the meaning of the sound was, \" Ah, he\nwas a monk. He seems to have committed some crime\nand then to have said mass, and the crime weighed heavier\non his conscience in consequence.\" A dagger was then\nviolently knocked off the table to the other side of the\nroom. I was not looking at Home at the moment and\ncannot say whether he struck it or not. \" Oh,\" he said,\n\" he cannot bear the sight of that.\" A large pair of\nscissors were then dashed on to the floor from off the\nround table, no one being near it. Home said, \" He can-\nnot bear anything sharp and pointed ; Ah, he is trying to\npick up the scissors, but he cannot touch them because\nthey have, as you see, fallen in the shape of a cross.\nAh, poor fellow, he says he will not hurt you. he would\nnot stop a minute here, but that he sees you do not hate\nand despise him ; he will do you no harm, but you must\nnot mind his being rough and abrupt in his manner. He\ndoes not wish you to speak about this to the others, but he\nwants you, Charlie, and Dan, to come here to-night ; he\nhas something to say ; he does not like those seances down\nstairs, he is not pleased. He cannot speak to you him-\nself, he can scarcely make manifestations ; he talks old\nIrish. He is the same spirit that Fred saw,i he was\nstripped of his gown and appeared to have on a blanket.\"\nOn the same afternoon, or the day before, I forget which,\nMr. Lawless, Home, and myself were seated on the bed in\n^ This alluded to Mr. Lawless, having told us, while on a visit here\nlast winter, tliat he had seen a ghost or spirit in the castle. I did not\npay much attention to his statements, supposing it to have been some\nillusion on his part.\n\fNO. 54] With D. D. Home 185\nmy room ; Charlie Wynne was sitting by the fire. We\nheard raps on the table, and a sound as of a hand brush-\ning on the wall, and the bed vibrated. A.\nNo. 54:.~Seance, March 2nd [1869].\nPresent :\u2014Mrs. and Miss Wynne, Mrs. and Major Black-\nburn, Miss Smith, Captain Wynne, Mr. Lawless. Home,\nand myself. This evening we sat at a table in the\ngallery ;\nvery slight physical manifestations occurred, which\nsoon ceased, and after waiting some time, the party broke\nup. Mrs. Blackburn, Miss Wynne, Captain Wynne, Mr.\nLawless, and Home went up to my room to try there.\nI followed them in about a quarter of an hour. Before\nI arrived they had a message to the effect that the spirits\nwould do more if they could ; afterwards we had the usual\nmanifestations, currents of air, vibrations, raps, tilting of\nthe table, which was on two occasions also raised in the\nair. At one time, Miss Wynne, Home, and I heard a\nvery singular rumbling and rolhng sort of sound in the\nair behind us, which was repeated three times. We saw\nhands (apparently) moving under the table cloth ; and Mrs.\nBlackburn, Home, and I were touched. Mrs. Blackburn's\ndress was sharply pulled two or three times, as was also\nMiss Wynne's ; we all saw and heard it. Mrs. Blackburn\nwas slightly under influence, and became a good deal\nagitated. Home went into a trance ; walked about, and\ndescribed to Mrs. Blackburn two spirits that were standing\nbehind her magnetizing her and causing the agitation she\nfelt. He said, \" They will do you no harm, but on the\ncontrary what they are about is for a good object ; one\nof them magnetized you in the same way this afternoon,\nbut there are now two, and it is consequently stronger.\nThe influence about you is very good, but very strong,\nyou could hear raps at night now.\" Mrs. Blackburn said,\n\" Oh, please don't !\n\" Mr. Home rephed, \" Oh, no ; don't\nbe nervous, they will not do it ;\nthey know it would\nfrighten you, and they will never do that; but the time\nwill come when you will not be frightened at it.\" Going\n\f186 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nto Mr. Lawless, he said, \" You really must have more\ncommand over your nerves, if you cannot control them\nyou must not come to seances ; you will get more and\nmore hysterical, and it will do you physical harm ;\nyou\nhad better go away for a few minutes.\" Then turning\nto me, he said, \" You did not do what you promised last\nnight. He is here ;\nyou know who I mean.\" I repHed,\n\" Yes, I know ; but Dan said last night that he had an\nimpression that Mrs. Wynne and I were to sit with him ;\nand I could not do what I promised.\" Home said, \" You\nmight have done so afterwards ; however it is perhaps as\nwell that you did not, for you might have attributed Dan's\nillness to that. He is still here ; he is not pleased.\" I\nasked, \" Would it do as well to-night, or to-morrow 1\n\"\nHome replied, \" No ; he says he will come unexpectedly\nagain as he did the first time. Oh yes, he knows that\nyou did not forget, he does not blame you, but he is not\npleased ; he is very much annoyed at these sittings down\nstairs.\" Home then opened the window, and appeared to\nbe debating as to whether he should go out or not. He\nshut the window and said, \" You will not let us do it ;\nyou have not sufficient faith.\" He then sat down and\nawoke. We had a few more physical manifestations, the\nlast being that Home's chair was drawn away from the\ntable. -A..\nNo. 55.\u2014Seance, March 3rd [1869].\nThis seance was held in Adare's room. Present :\n\u2014Mrs.\nWynne, Adare, Mr. Home, and myself. Soon after we\nwere seated, Mr. Home went into a trance. He got up\nand walked about, remarking that the influence was good,\nand that Mrs. Wynne's influence was very pleasant. He\nwent to the door, opened it, and said, \" Ah, here is that\nstrange spirit that came to Ashley House\u2014Thomas, your\nfather's friend\u2014he is very eccentric ; he says he wants to\nrecall some conversation to your father.\" I said, \" I hope\nhe will do so.\" Adare observed that if he exhibited the\nsame curiously abrupt and undecided manner that he did\n\fNO. 55] With D. D. Home 187\nat Ashley House {vide No. 44, p. 163), he would probably\nsay nothing, at any rate this night.\" Home said, \" Oh,\nthat was his manner ; he is very eccentric.\" He then\nwalked up to Mrs. Wynne, and made passes over her head,\nand held it between his hands, and told her that her cir-\nculation was bad (which it is), and that her liver was out\nof order.\nHe pointed to me saying, \" Your influence is very good\nfor physical manifestations ;\nyou must not think that you\nare any impediment to their occurrence.\" I had been\nfancying that probably my presence was rather adverse,\nand consequently I was unwiUing to attend the seance\n;\nbut I had not mentioned this to Home. He then gave\nAdare directions about the table. \" You will place it near\nthe window ;\nyour father will sit next to Daniel, you on\nhis other side, then Mrs. Wynne, leaving a vacant space\nnext to the window.\" We then commenced talking about\nhis having had apparently some idea of going out of the\nwindow last night [vide No. 54), and were discussing as to\nwhether there was any real danger in his doing so ; some\nsaying they would be nervous, while others, myseK among\nthem, said we should feel no anxiety whatever as to his\nsafety ;\nupon which he remarked, \" They will take care\nand see when the conditions are right ; there need be no\nfear.\" He then spoke about one of the semices which had\nbeen held when he was not present, and said, \" We do\nnot approve of it at all ; it is all wrong ; the whole thing\nis in confusion. That sentence about B and the wicked\ndevil is not right ; there is no wicked devil in that sense.\nWe do not wish to enter into any explanation, we only\ntell you that it is all wrong.\" Turning to Mrs. Wynne,\nMr. Home said, \" John says he is coming to you to-night,\nand that he wants to try and put his hand in yours.\"\nSoon after this he sat down and awoke. He spoke during\nhis trance in a loud whisper.\nWe took the table over to the window and seated our-\nselves as we had been directed. We soon heard a number\nof very delicate raps, like a continuous stream of httle\nelectrical sparks, which lasted for a short time ;\nthey were\nbarely audible without placing the ear close to the cloth\n\f188 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nwhich covered the table. We then felt vibrations, and\nheard raps of different kinds, chiefly on the table, but\nsome dull sounds like knocks, occurred elsewhere. We\nhad extinguished the candles, but the fire gave sufficient\nlight to see near objects well, and distant ones faintly.\nIn the recess of the window was a large box or chest\nwith papers and other things lying upon it ; one could\nsee them, without being able clearly to distinguish what\nthey were. The alphabet being called for, the following\nmessages were given, with short intervals between them,\nduring which there were frequent raps :\n\" God be ivith you.\nYour father Thomas Goold. You must not think ive fear the\ncross, ive love it, loe also love God.'' \" We are allowed to\n2iray for you and watch over you.'' Soon after several loud\nraps or knocks were heard, and the name \" John Wynne \"\nwas spelled out. About this time there were movements\nand sounds about the papers on the box, and Mrs. Wynne's\ndress was touched. Presently we had the following message :\n\" Could you hut know the reality of my identity, and the\nunaltered and unalterable love I hear you, I well know it\nivould he a source of joy to you. I have not sent you\nmessages, for the reason that you could have no means of\ndistinguishing the certainty of my personality.'' ^ I then\nsaid, \" To whom is this message sent,\" and the answer\nwas, \" You, my own.\" I added, \" I should like to know\nthe name of the sj^irit,\" and was answered, \" Augusta.\"\nAt this point some interruption seemed to occur. Mrs.\nWynne's dress was visibly and audibly moved about, and\nMr. Home several times saw a hand ; the slight sounds\nabout the papers on the box recurred. Presently, Mr.\nHome's feet were moved and placed upon mine ;\nstrong\nmovements of his arms and legs took place ; his hands\nappeared to be drawn about in different directions, and\nrather violently agitated. After these movements had\n^ This message clearly referred to my having several times lately\nremarked upon the fact, that no message had, I believe, been sent to\nme on any occasion during the previous seances in London or elsewhere,\nby the spirit who would most naturally under the circumstances have\ndone so\u2014which fact I had used as an argument bearing upon a par-\nticular view of the whole subject.\n\fNO. 55] With D. D. Home 189\nceased, he said, \" I feel a hand on me, pressing against\nmy chest ; and now it has, I think, taken the flowers from\nmy button-hole.\" The idea came into my mind that per-\nhaps these flowers were intended for me ; I quietly laid\none hand open upon my knee. Almost immediately a\nflower was placed very delicately in it. I then felt another\nflower, and tried to grasp the hand holding it, but did not\nsucceed ; it seemed to vanish, leaving the flower in my\nhand. Some curious manifestations now took place. The\ncloth on the table was lifted up, fully six inches, as by\na hand. This occurred along the side next the window\nseveral times. Mr. Home saw the hand. Mrs. Wynne\nbecame nervous, which was to be regretted, as she might\nprobably have felt the hand as had been told her at the\ncommencement of the seance. There were vibrations and\ntiltings of the table, and various kinds of raps. Presently,\nthe alphabet was called for, and the following given :\nEven should we he taken to a distant heaven, ivoidd it not\nhe our greatest joy to fly as the \" Here the message\nstopped ; and we heard a rustling sound about the box in\nthe window, which lasted two or three minutes. Adare\nsaid, \" I am sure I know what this means.\" My hand\nwas on my knee. I suddenly felt something touch it,\nwhich I laid hold of, and drew out from under the table ;\nit was an arrow. We then re-commenced the alphabet ;\nand the word \" descends \" was given, thus flnishing the\nsentence : ''as the arrow descends.'' During this mani-\nfestation, as also when the flowers were being placed in\nmy hand, Mr. Home was sitting quite still, with both his\nhands on the table. A sheet of paper was lying on the\nedge of the table next the window, on which a pencil was\nplaced. We presently saw the pencil moving about on the\npaper. Mr. Home saw the fingers holding it. Adare\nnoticed it also, more than once, but of an undefined form.\nWe now heard something moving upon the box by the\nwindow, and a heavy substance fell near Adare's feet.\nSome of us at the same moment perceived a decided smell\nof brandy. Adare said, \" I know what it is.\" The\nfollowing message was then given :\n\" You must not take for\nyour cold stimulants.\" Adare asked if he was to take\n\f190 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nnone at all. The answer was by two raps, meaning,\n\" perhaps,'\" or \"a little.'' We afterwards found that it\nwas Adare's flask which had been thrown under the table.\nOn examining it no brandy appeared to have escaped.\nSoon after this a curious manifestation occurred about the\ntable, just hke the sound and motion of the vibration on\nboard a steamer. This was succeeded by the following\nmessage : \"We deeply regret, hut tve have no more power.\nGod abide ivith you.\" During this beautiful seance, which\nlasted nearly two hours, the table was twice raised up\nfrom a foot to eighteen inches. The messages were spelled\npartly by raps and partly by tilts of the table. I was\ntouched on two occasions, rather delicately, on the knee.\nThe whole seance was quiet, soothing, and very impressive.\nD.\nNo. 5Q.\u2014Seance, March Uh [1869].\nPresent :\n\u2014Major and Mrs. Blackburn, Miss Wynne, Law-\nless, Charlie Wynne, Home, my father, and myself. We\nsat in my room, which was hghted by one candle and the\nfire. After sitting for some time without any movement\nof the table or other indication of influence. Home went\ninto a trance. He got up, said in a low voice to me\n\" We have put Dan into a trance to try and equalize the\natmosphere, we wish to make manifestations,\" and after\nwalking about the room magnetizing it commenced speak-\ning in a singularly soothing tone of voice, his conversation\nbeing principally addressed to Mrs. Blackburn. \" There\nare two Ehzabeths\u2014who are they ? And Isabella\u2014she\nseems to have taken care of you, John, when you were\nyoung. There is a spirit present with whom you were\nacquainted, he is lame ;\nyou do not remember the name\nnow, but you probably will hereafter. Who was Margaret\nHenderson ? (no one answered). Ah, your mother would\nknow, ask her ; she will remember about her. Talk, go\non talking to each other, your minds are much too positive ;\nthe human mind is like a barrier to us. Your minds now\nare all intent, and it makes such a confusion that I can-\n\fNO. 56] With D. D. Home 191\nnot see and find out what I want ; it is like looking\nthrough a shrubbery with all the branches in motion : I\ncannot make out clearly what there is on the other side.\"\nMrs. Blackburn becoming shghtly under influence and\nagitated, he stood behind her and calmed her, saying,\n\" You must not mind it, they will do you no harm ; when\non earth they would not have hurt you, why should they\nnow ? You must have trust ; but even if you have not\nconfidence in them, you know that God protects you from\nall evil\u2014have trust in him. Should it seem unpleasant\nand even evil to you, remember that God's ways are not\nour ways ; and out of what is apparently evil, much good\nmay come ; that which you might at first consider bad,\nmay turn out to be the greatest good to you. It is the\ninfluence that came over Dan when we put him into a\ntrance that affected you ; it was so strong\u2014that is all.\"\nStanding near Miss Wynne he said, \" There are two Wind-\nhams here, two young men, Windham Goold and Windham\nQuin.\" Touching Charlie Wynne on the shoulder he said,\n\" Charhe, Robert says he has not forgotten his promise,\nhe will keep it, but he has not been able to do so yet ;\nhe is going to Emmy.\" Home then walked about the\nroom and said, \" When Maria has sufficient faith and is\nwilling to be developed for the good of others, she will\ngo into trances.\" IVIrs. Blackburn requested my father to\nask Home if it was necessary that she should be wilUng.\nHome said, \" Do not be frightened, nothing will be done\nto harm you, when you have sufficient faith in God's\nprotecting power,\u2014when you can say, '\nThy will not mine\nbe done,'\u2014when you are anxious for it for the benefit of\nothers, and to advance the truth, then it will come to\nyou ; until then the fact of your being unwilUng, of your\nmind being opposed, would prevent it. Oh, there is a\nMary (or Maria) here, I like her so much. Dear me ! she\nhas such a curious way of smihng\u2014she smiles with her\nmouth only, she is very timid. There is also a man who\nappears to have been shot ; who can he be 1 Was he\nyour grandmother's uncle ? He seems to have been in a\nnaval engagement. Although Mary is so timid, Maria, she\nis your principal guardian spirit ; there is a miniature or\n\f192 Experiences m Spiritualism [seance\nportrait of her, with sonie peculiarity in the dress, do you\nknow it ?\n\" Mrs. Blackburn replied, \" No.\" Home said,\n\" Ah, well there is one, at any rate there is a black cut\nprofile of her. There is an Alexander present.\" Home\nwent on for some time speaking about the spirits in the\nroom, and then stood behind my father and told us all\nto talk ; while we were talking, he whispered to him, \" You\nshould not fast much.\" He said, \"I do not really fast\nat all.\" Home added, \" Your brain is very active and is\nwearing the vital powers, and you should take nourishing\nfood\u2014fasting materially would be bad, but spiritually would\nbe good for you.\" Home soon after awoke. A.\nAfter this we remained sitting for an hour and a quarter\nwithout any manifestations whatever. Mr. Home said\nseveral times, \" I feel a strong influence all about me ; it\nis strange that there are no physical manifestations.\" At\nlast I proposed that some of the party should leave the\nroom, being certain that something must be wrong.\nBlackburn and I went away. Mr. Home remarked, \" A\nfew moments will shew whether their presence was the\nobstruction.\" Still no manifestations. He then said,\n\" Charlie, do you and Lawless go, and send the others\nback.\" Lawless went with the greatest reluctance. The\ndoor had hardly closed when there were cold currents,\nvibrations, and raps. I returned, and was scarcely seated,\nwhen the alphabet was called for, and this message given :\n\" We love Freddy, but he is not in a state of mind or tody\nconducive to manifestations^ Wynne fetched the accordion.\nMrs. Blackburn was very soon after touched on the dress,\nand something became plainly visible moving under the\ntable cloth, along the edge of the table, raising up the\ncloth several inches, as would be done were a hand and\narm [underneath it].^ The hand was visible on the cloth\nto Mr. Home, and I once faintly perceived it. It touched Mrs.\nBlackburn's hand. This manifestation was repeated different\ntimes. I was touched on the ankle, and several times on\nthe knee. Miss Wynne's dress was strongly pulled. The\n^ This sentence is incomplete in the original edition. The general\nmeaning is however clear. [Ed:]\n\fNO. 56] With D. D. Howe 193\ntable was beautifully raised in the air, by three successive\nlifts, to the height of eighteen inches or two feet. Mr.\nHome then took the accordion, holding it under the edge\nof the table with one hand, the other resting on the table ;\nsoon after it began to sound, it played with considerable\npower as well as great delicacy, something like a voluntary,\nwith airs introduced. Then there were sounds like echoes,\nso fine, as to be scarcely audible. The accordion was\ndrawn out towards Mrs. Blackburn, but not put into her\nhand. I expressed a wish that it might be played with-\nout being held by Mr. Home, upon which he withdrew\nhis hand, placing it on the table ; the instrument was just\ntouching the under edge of the table, where it remained,\nas it were, suspended. It began playing very gently. He\nclapped his hands several times to shew that he was not\ntouching it. The playing soon ceased, and he took it\nagain. Some notes sounded out of tune, and I said,\n\" either wrong notes are played in the chord, or the\naccordion is out of tune.\" \" Out of time \" was rapped out\non the instrument. It played again very finely, and with\nthe tremolo efi^ect, which struck me exceedingly. I asked,\n\" Will you tell us who is playing \" ; two raps were given,\nimplying doubt. Presently the alphabet was called for,\nand the following given :\n\" Remember that ;\n\" and then \" Oft\nin the stilly night \" was softly played. When one recalls\nthe words :\n\u2014\nOft in the stilly night, ere slumber's chain hath bound me,\nFond memory brings the light of other days around me, &c.\nhow touching the message becomes, and how beautiful the\nmode of representing it.'^ I then again asked, \" Will you\nnot tell us the name of the spirit who has been playing.\"\nThe letters \" a-u-g \" were rapped out by my being touched\ndelicately on the knee. I guessed the completion of the\nword, saying, \" Is it Augusta ?\n\" and I was touched, \" Yes.\"\nI then asked whether it would be possible for the organ\nto be played if the bellows were filled, and the reply\n\" Perhaps,\" was given. I said, \" I can identify the player\n^ This air was, long ago, one of my greatest favourites.\n\f194 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nfrom a particular circumstance.\" Some one remarked, \" Is\nit from AA'hat was played, or by the expression ?\n\" \" No,\"\nI replied, when Adare said, \"Is it from the imitation of\nthe tremolo 1\n\" \" Yes,\" I replied, \" that reminded me\nimmediately of the organ ;\n\" upon which the following was\ninstantly rapped out, by my being again touched on the\nknee :\n\" You are right my own.'' Soon after this we all\nheard strong sounds which proceeded seemingly from a\nlarge oblong writing table, which stood several feet from\nus ; we could perceive it moving ; it stopped within a foot\nof our table, which then moved up to it. We heard first\none and then another drawer opened, on the side of the\ntable farthest from us, and a rusthng sound as if stirring\npapers. After a short pause, the following sentence was\ngiven, partly, if not wholly, (I forget which) by tilting the\ntable :\n\" We must cease, hut 7iot before praying God to bless\nyou.'' We then adjourned. During the sitting the table\nwas again lifted in the beautiful manner before mentioned,\nreminding me very much of the action of the bellows of\nthe organ while being filled ; and it is very remarkable\nthat this occurred, as will be seen in the foregoing de-\nscription, just before the playing commenced. D.\nHaving left my room, Home and I went down to the\nsmoking room. While he was speaking to me he broke\noff suddenly in the middle of a word with a violent start\nand went into a trance. Major Blackburn at that moment\ncame into the room, and witnessed what occurred. Home\njumped up, caught me by the hand, beckoned to Major\nBlackburn to follow, and led us up to my room in a\ngreat hurry. On opening the door, he said (apparently to\nsome spirit in the room), \" Oh, please do not do that !\n\"\nHe then drew out the long writing table, placed it near\nthe window, put two chairs in front of the fire, and hung\na blanket over them to exclude the light ; then placed a\nchair at each end of the table for us, and one for himseK\nat the side of the table opposite the window and the\ndrawers. He drew out one of the drawers and placed a\npiece of paper and a pencil in it ; tlien sitting down, he\nsaid, \" Listen !\n\" I listened, and distinctly heard the sound\n\fNO. 56] With D. D. Home 195\nof a pencil writing on a piece of paper in the open drawer ;\nthe word written was finished by three dots. Home then\nthrew himself back in his chair and said, \" Oh, she is so\nthankful that your father has seen what he has !\n\" He\nbegan to sob violently, and calhng me over to him, he\ngrasped my hand, and said, \" Oh, my darling I am so\nglad that he has seen something ; I wish he could have\nbeen here now, but the conditions happened to be favour-\nable at this moment, and we could not wait. You \\vill\ngive him the paper on which I have written, and the\npencil ; the pencil must be kept ; it may be used again,\nbut only at Adare. There was a spirit here when you\ncame in, who damaged the conditions a little, and the\nwriting is in consequence not very firm ; the pencil point\nalso broke, and the last letters are not quite distinct ; the\ncolour of the pencil is typical of my love\u2014pure, deep, and\neverlasting.\" The pencil was a red one, and the word\nwritten was \" Augusta.\" Home, on being asked afterwards\nabout his going so suddenly into a trance, said, \" I can\nremember being in the smoking room, and seeing two\nspirits enter by the door ;\nrapidly approaching, one of\nthem stretched out his hand towards me, and I immedi-\nately lost consciousness.\" A.\nNo. 57.\nIt was now nearly 10 p.m., and my father, Charlie\nWynne, Home and I went to the Abbey ; we walked up\nthe church, and stood near the altar. Home shortly went\ninto a trance. He took o&. a white comforter that he\nwore round his neck, and tied it over his head, and began\nwalking with rapid measured strides up and down the\nchurch. By the expression of his face, by his gestures,\nand by his moaning, he appeared to be in great agony of\nmind. As he walked he made (with his mouth, I think)\na sound that appeared to us closely to resemble that of\na man walking in sandals or wooden shoes, upon a tiled\nor stone floor. His head became luminous, as did also his\nhands. This occurred twice ; the second time more faintly.\n\f196 Experiences in Sjnritualism [seance\nAn owl flew round the church screeching ; I attributed the\nnoise to Home, but as he passed me he said in a most\nawful voice, \" No, it is not so ;\n\" and as he repassed, he\nadded, \" You were mistaken.\" He kneeled upon the ground\noccasionally, waved his arms above his head, and appeared\nin great distress. He came up to us and, in a frightened\ntone of voice, said, \" Oh, come away\u2014come away !\n\" and\nled us down to the other end of the church. He walked\nabout a little longer, then, taking my father's arm, he\nsaid, \" Do you see that tomb-stone with the light shining\nupon it ? It would be better, aye, ten million times\nbetter, to lie there in the cold dark clay, than to spend\nyears upon years, every moment of which is an eternity,\nin wandering here.\" Raising his hands above his head, he\nadded, \" oh, I am so weary\u2014so weary !\n\" Soon after this\nhe awoke. He was rather nervous, and said to me, \" Who\nis that man standing by the window 1 Is it Lord Dun-\nraven ? \" He seemed quite astonished when he found we\nwere all near him, and that none of us could see the figure.\nDuring the rest of the time we remained in the Abbey,\nHome was entranced, I suppose, four or five times, and\neven in the intervals, when he was awake and knew where\nhe was and what he was doing, he was under a very strong\ninfluence. He stood talking to us for a few minutes, and\nthen said, \" The figure is beckoning to me. I am quite\nawake and not the least nervous ; I must go.\" He accord-\ningly moved towards the window and we followed him at\na short distance. He left the church by the choir door,\nand went beyond the low broken wall, saying that he saw\nthe figure standing against a portion of the ruins, at some\nlittle distance from where we were standing. I saw a\ndark shadow against the wall, and I saw a light flash from\nit as distinctly as if some one had struck a match there ;\nCharlie Wynne said he saw the light flash at the same\nmoment that I did ;\nmy father saw the Hght also, but\nfaintly. Home walked towards the spot where he said the\nfigure was standing, he went behind the wall, and remained\nout of sight for some minutes ; when he reappeared there\nwas somebody, or something with him, that is to say, I\ncould clearly perceive some substance moving alongside of\n\fNO. 57] With D. D. Home 197\nhim as he walked. Presently we all saw him approaching,\nand evidently raised off the ground, for he floated by, in\nfront of US at a height which carried him over the broken\nwall, which was about two feet high. There could not be\na better test of his being off the ground, for as he crossed\nthe wall, his form was not in the least raised, but the\nmovement was quite horizontal and uniform. The distance\nthat we saw him thus carried, must have been at least\n10 or 12 yards.\nHe then came back to us and we found he was in a\ntrance. He directed our attention to an old doorway near\nus, saying, \" He is there ; he is laying a stone ;\nyou will\nhear the sound of a trowel.\" We listened and heard in-\ndistinct sounds ; I cannot say that they resembled the\nsound of laying a stone. Home then awoke, and said\nthat he remembered that, before he went into the trance,\nhe had been walking about with a man dressed like a\nfriar in a brown gown ; that they had been talking to-\ngether, but that he did not know what he had said to\nhim ; that this spirit (the friar) was unable to leave the\nearth ; that he and the spirit had both been raised in\nthe air by some other strong influence. He described the\nspirit as leaning on his shoulder. He soon left us, and\napparently was again engaged in conversation with this\nspirit. He then returned, and spoke to us. This he\nrepeated two or three times, being sometimes in a trance\nand sometimes awake when he addressed us. Finally,\nwhile in the trance, he led us back into the church, kneeled\non the ground, apparently in prayer, two or three times,\nand then began walking up and down the church, raising\nhis hands above his head, and saying, \" Oh, how good !\nOh, how good !\n\" He then came up to us, and told us\nthat the spirit would be better and happier for something\nthat he had said or done that night, after which he awoke.\nHe said that he saw a figure in the air between us and\nthe window. Charhe Wynne and I both saw a shadow\nmove across the window. We then returned home.\nIt is a fact worthy of notice that although the night\nwas perfectly calm, the birds appeared to be in a singu-\nlarly disturbed state ; owls were flitting about, and some\n\f198 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nother bird flew several times round the church, screaming\nharshly. Besides night birds, ordinary birds (judging by\nthe sounds) were flying about ; and at one time, just as\nHome said he saw the figure enter a clump of trees at\nsome distance from us, a bird seemed to fly out, chirping.\nWe heard in the church a sound as of a bird flying round\nwhistling, and Home, being then in a trance, appeared as\nif following it about, and endeavouring to catch it. I\ncould see nothing, and do not know whether it was a real\nbird or not. A.\nAccurate as is the foregoing account of this strange\nscene, it would be difiicult, indeed impossible, to convey\nby any description, a just idea of its solemnity. When\nwe entered the ruins the night was quite dark and very\nstill. We walked quietly up the nave and choir, and\nstood for some little time near the east window. Scarce\na word was spoken. We had not the least idea what sort\nof manifestations were likely to occur. While Mr. Home\nwas walking a]>out, what with the deep tones of the voice\nso utterly unlike his own\u2014the occasional moans and utter-\nances of sounds of pain or distress\u2014his disappearing in the\ngloom and reappearing again^\u2014the light shining around his\nhead and upon his hands, which were occasionally lifted\nas if in prayer, and were thus visible when the rest of\nthe figure was lost in darkness ; his attitudes, sometimes\nkneeling, at others as if searching for something near the\nground\u2014the strange sounds which we heard, particularly a\nsort of chirping or unearthly whistling, which seemed to\nproceed from him, and the startling screams made by some\nbird, but what bird we had not light enough to identify ;\nthe effect produced upon us was most thrilling, and one\nwhich we are not hkely soon to forget. Before leaving\nthe Abbey the light from the moon, just about to rise,\nenabled us to see objects ; the sky too had become clear,\nand the stars shone out, while an air of calmness and\npeace pervaded the scene, producing a most soothing effect\nupon our minds. D.\n\fNO. 57] With D. D. Home 19U\nWe had supper in the hall upon our return. While\ntalking, a curious rushing or rumbUng noise was heard\nthat we could not account for, and my father felt his\nchair vibrating. Home went into a trance, and told us\nto follow him into the gallery. We did so, and at his\nrequest stood near the piano, while he sat down at the\ninstrument. The piano vibrated strongly. Home played\na powerful and impressive chant, and then commenced\nspeaking of the joys and sorrows of our hfe, telling us\nhow they (the spirits) sympathized with us. He described\nwhat he was speaking of on the piano, playing discords\nfor the sorrows and trials of hfe,^ and harmony for the\njoys. He said, \" There is a merry spirit here who rejoices\nthat you have done good,\" and he played a lively air. He\nadded, \" They made that rushing noise you all heard down\nstairs, to testify their happiness that you have all done a\ngood action in going to the Abbey to-night,\" (turning to\nmy father), \" It was your father and your brother who\nshook your chair in the hall.\" He then began speaking\nabout the immeasurable goodness and greatness of God,\nand finally rose up, stood in the middle of the room, and\ndelivered a very beautiful prayer in the most impressive\nand earnest manner. He then awoke. It was past three\no'clock. A.\nNo. 5S.\u2014Sea7ice, March 5th [1869].\nThis evening, one of the ladies who had previously been\nmuch interested in the subject of Spirituahsm, was seized\nwith a sudden and unaccountable idea that the whole\nthing was either demoniacal in its origin or imposture,\nand that it was her duty to denounce it. She did so in\nsuch unmeasured terms that she succeeded in thoroughly\ndisquieting the minds of more than one of our party.\nAfter dinner we had a seance in my room : present, INIrs.\nand Miss Wynne, Major and Mrs. Blackburn, Charlie\nWynne, my father, Home and myself. We had scarcely\nany physical manifestations, but shortly after sitting down\nwe received the following message :\n\u2014\" The conditions are\n\f200 \u2022\nExperiences in Spiritualism [seance\nnot so favourable this evening ;\n\" my father asked if the\nconditions were affected by any one in the circle, the\nanswer was, \" iVo.\" We soon after obtained the following\ncommunication, having reference probably to a conversation\nthat had taken place that afternoon on Spirituahsm, and\nits elfect upon religion :\n\u2014\" We do not hid, or even wish,\nyou to have faith in us, we mily come to proclaim immor-\ntality, and the reality and nearness of the spiritual world.'''\n^\nHome soon went into a trance, and walked about the\nroom, magnetizing it ; he stood by Mrs. Wynne, and said,\n\" Your brother Windham is near you and wishes to kiss\nyou, his mouth is close to your forehead, but you are\nnervous and that prevents it ; he will come again presently\nand will do it if he can.\" Home now sat down and\nspoke somewhat as follows :\n\u2014\" The conditions are not\naffected by any one in particular in the circle, but by the\ndisturbed and agitated state of your minds ; a good many\nunpleasant things have occurred to-day and have caused\nthis. The possibility of our communicating with you is\nmuch affected by the condition of your minds ; a calm\nand prayerful state is absolutely necessary for the approach\nof a high spiritual influence, while in an unsettled and\nirritated condition you become easy of access to the lower\nand less pure influences.\n\" The human mind in its natural beauty is calm, and\ncasts a holy and peaceful influence on all near it ; it is\nthen like a lovely flower, not only beautiful to the eye,\nbut affecting all around with its delicious fragrance. But,\nwhen disturbed and terrified by fears and doubts, the\nbeauty of the mind and its fragrance are destroyed, re-\nsembling the same flower crushed and unable any longer\nto shed abroad its sweet and natural odours. The present\ndisturbed condition of some among you has a much wider\neffect than you would suppose ;\nas, if you drop a stone\ninto the placid waters of a lake, the ripples will spread\nout gradually widening and widening until they have passed\nover a large portion of its surface ;\nso, in like manner,\n1 Some interruption occurred, which prevented the words after \" t'w-\nmorUility ,\nand,'' being written down ; the remainder is supplied from\nmemory, and is believed to be correct.\n\fNO. 58] With D. D. Home 201\nthe waves emanating from your minds have a wide-spread\ninfluence upon the atmosphere around you.\" Home spoke\nto us for some time very beautifully in a soothing tone\nof voice ; he deprecated the idea that spirits wished to\ninterfere in matters of reUgion. \" Do we,\" he said,\n\" set ourselves up as teachers, or tell you to love God\nless, or to be uncharitable 1 Do we interfere with the\nevery-day walk of hfe ?\n\" He spoke in this strain for\nsome httle time, then saying, \" the conditions are getting\na little more favourable,\" he arose, went to the door,\nopened it, and appearing to invite some one to enter, led\nthe person up to Mrs. Blackburn, saying to her as he did\nso, \" He cannot come fast.\" During the address Mrs.\nBlackburn had become shghtly under influence ; Home took\nno notice of it at the time, but he now stood by her\nmaking passes, and calmed her. He spoke to her very\nbeautifully and earnestly on the subject of the power she\npossessed of being developed as a medium. He entreated\nher to have trust, not in them (the spirits) but in God ;\nhe begged her to repeat after him \" Thy will be done,\"\nand he seemed much pleased when she did so. He said,\n\" Do you remember to whom these words apply ?\n'\nAnd\nhe did not many mighty works there because of their\nunbehef !\n' \" \" Yes,\" she said, \" they refer to Christ.\"\n\" Then, if the highest and mightiest power had this difli-\nculty to contend with, namely, their unbehef, how much\nmore must it affect us. Oh, have faith and trust.\" Home\nthen sat down and addressed us on the same subject of\nmediumship, drawing a simile from an account my father\nhad been giving us of a fortnight he had spent in Quar-\nantine, in a place just like a prison. He spoke somewhat\nas follows :\n\" Dunraven has been telling you how he spent\nsome time shut up, deprived of the society of his friends.\nNow if you were in prison, knowing that your friends were\nwithout, separated from you only by a great impassable\nwall, would you not yearn\u2014oh, so earnestly\u2014to send them\na few words of love ; then if you found some one who\nwas capable of carrying a message for you, would you not\nthink it a little hard if that person refused. Although\nyou might know that your message would be distorted and\nI\n\f202 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nconfused by passing through the hands of a third person,\nthat you could not possibly say all that you would wish ;\nstill would you not be intensely anxious to send\u2014if only\none word\u2014to testify of your existence to your sorrowing\nand weeping friends. It is so with us ; there is between\nus and you a great barrier, through the portals of which\nwe have passed ; we yearn to send a few words of love\nto the dear ones we have left beyond it, and when we\nfind some one who could carry that message, is it not\njust a little hard that they should be unwilling to do so.\"\n(Turning to Mrs. Blackburn), \" Do you not love your\nchildren ? Will you not ever love them, even when you\nhave passed away ? Think then of others\u2014be not selfish\n\u2014God is not selfish in his love for us, trust in Him.\"\nHome got up and whispered to my father, \" You ought\nto have taken some nourishing food to-day,\" (the day was\nFriday). He then came to me and said, \"Go to the\nCastle to-night, we may not be able to make any mani-\nfestations, but it will do good ;\nyou will go to the Abbey\nto-morrow night\u2014ah, but it will rain !\n\" he went to the\nwindow, looked out and said, \" No, it will do, you will\ngo after twelve o'clock, do not have any seance Ijefore you\ngo ; the external influence is not very good for your\nnerves.\" Home now walked about the room making a\nsound as of kissing some one, he then sat down and\nawoke. Suljsequently the manifestations were slight, and\nwe got the message :\n\" We think it better to reserve the\npower till later.'' We then adjourned.\nSoon after, we proceeded to the Castle, Home and I\nwalking a little in advance of the others. On the way\nhe became under influence. As we neared the Abbey I\nsaw a whitish shadow pass from the ruin into a clump of\ntrees. Home said, \" That is the same spirit you saw there\nthe other night, you observe that he is much whiter.\"\nHome ran forward on the road jumping apparently with\ndelight, and when he came back said, \" I was made to do\nthat to shew you that he is much happier.\" When we\nwere about haK-way between the Abbey and the Castle,\nHome said, \" It all looks peopled, they are more real to\nme than those,\" turning and pointing to the rest of the\n\fNO. 58] With D. D. Home 203\nparty, who were a few yards behind. He now became\ncompletely entranced, and said, \" Spirits are sometimes\ncompelled to revisit places that they were much connected\nwith when on earth. It may not be exactly a punish-\nment ;\nthey may be occupied about many other things,\nbut at certain seasons they are drawn by an irresistible\nimpulse to revisit such places. Now, supposing you had\nan estate, and the people on the neighbouring property\ndiffered from you in opinions or behef, and you gathered\nyour people together and fought against them, destroying\nproperty and even life ; that would be all very well for\na time, but then you know there comes the passing away,\nand you see clearly all the evil you have done, and the\nmisery you have caused. Such a man was Oliver Crom-\nwell. Of course, where a man errs through ignorance, and\nacts up to the best of his knowledge and abihty, it is a\ndifferent thing, but so many men are actuated by a desire\nfor renoM^n and singularity ; there is as much pride in\nwishing to appear different from other men as there is\nin being over anxious to conform exactly to them, the\nQuaker, who puts on that pecuUar costume is in reality\nas vain as the fop who dresses himself in the height of\nfashion.\" We now entered the Castle, and Home led us\nover the drawbridge into the inner court, being still in a\ntrance. He bandaged his eyes with a handkerchief, saying,\n\" There is too much hght.\" My father observed, \" Yes,\nit is brighter than it was at the Abbey.\" Home replied,\nin rather a sharp tone of voice, \" Oh, not that sort of\nhght ; but there is too much for Daniel's eyes.\" He\nwalked about, and up and down the steep slope leading\nto the vaults without any difficulty, and then went into\nthe vault, where it was quite dark. We heard a noise ;\nI was at some distance from him, but my father, thinking\nthat he had tumbled down the steps, and hearing the\nsplash of something in the well, went forward to the door\nfeehng for him, and touched his hand. Home said, \"You\nthink that Daniel fell and was hurt, oh, no ;\nhe would\nnot be hurt even were he to fall from the top of the\ntower ;\nthey are here, and want to make themselves visible.\"\nMy father heard raps under his feet which I could not\n\f204 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nhear, as I was several yards distant ; he also heard a\nsound like drops of water falUng, and on two occasions\nobserving that three consecutive drops fell, sounding like\nthree raps, he said, \" That is water.\" Home repUed, in\nrather a contemptuous tone of voice, \" No ; does water\nanswer questions.\" Charlie Wynne asked if Dr. ElUotson\nwas present ; and three heavy thumps were heard above,\nas if on the ground over the vault. Home then came\nout, climbed up on the parapet wall, and remained there\nsome time, being generally concealed from us by the ivy ;\nwhen he returned, he led my father a little in advance of\nus, saying, \" He is trying to speak to you.\" My father\ncould neither see nor hear anything ; but I saw a faint\nlight against the wall, and heard indistinct sounds as of\nsome one trying to articulate. Charlie Wynne also saw\nthe light. Mrs. Blackburn asked Home if the spirit was\nhappy. \" No,\" he said ;\n\" but unhappy in a way you\ncannot understand, he is in a kind of way, happy in his\nunhappiness ; he is not exactly going through a punish-\nment, but he has a great work to do\u2014a work that he\ncan\u2014(drawing himself up, and speaking in a proud deter-\nmined tone of voice)\u2014aye, and that he ivill accomplish ;\nhe says he wishes to like you, Dunraven, and to be of\nservice to you ; but he does not quite feel as if he was\nworthy enough.\" Home now walked about the inner yard\nand stamped upon the ground all about a particular spot,\nthen calling me and my father, he said, \" There must be\na well here ; I sa.w a blueish light over it.\" We stamped\nupon the place, and it had a hollow sound. Home having\nawoke we left the Castle, he and I walking on before the\nothers ; we passed through the Abbey, but saw nothing.\nHome went into a trance, and said, \" You have been\nthinking about the hchens on the trees, and you may draw\na parallel between the condition of those trees and that\nof the human race. Those lichens resemble the pernicious\ninfluences that check and retard the race from its natural\nprogress towards perfection, as a time comes when the\ntrees are thus afl^ected, so arc there ages of advance and\nages of retrogression among men. It does as you say\nseem hard for those who live in a period of retrogression.\n\fNO. 58] With D. D. Home 205\nbut God's ways are not our ways, and the progress though\nit may be slow and checked, is yet inevitable, and sure\nto prevail in time ;\nnations may pass, and their civihzation\nfade away, but it will be taken up elsewhere ;\nthe creation\nis but in its infancy, man is very far removed from the\nperfection to which he ought\u2014aye, and to which he will\n\u2014arrive. These hchens do not appear to have been\ncaused by the excessive dampness of the seasons, they\nseem to be a deep-rooted bhght that has not originated\neven, on the earth, but has come over it in some sort of\ncloud ; it is like a contagious disease : thinning, and giving\nthem air would do good. We think that in about two\nyears they will get long, and the wind will blow them\naway to a great extent\u2014we mean the white ones ;\nthe\ngreen ones are flatter, and their roots sink deeper ;\nsome\nof us seem to think that a belt of tar round the trees\nmight do good,\u2014the experiment would be worth trying.\"\nHome now awoke.\nWe had a httle supper after we got home, and then\nHome proposed that we should go up to the gallery. We\nall did so and sat at the large centre table, the room\nbeing Ughted only by a ghmmer from the fire. Vibrations\ncommenced immediately. Home went into a trance, walked\nto the piano, and played the same fine chant as on a\nprevious occasion. He called my father over, made him\nstand near him, and said, \" I wish one of you could note\ndown this chant ; do you hear the harp V We all heard\nthe chords very delicately and faintly swept, the harp\nbeing covered at the time ; Home then removed the cover\nand my father heard some noise or movement about the\nharp and Home added, \" They are trying to tune it ;\n\"\nthey then returned to the table, and Home awoke. We\nhad strong vibrations and raps, and Charhe Wynne asked\nwhether Dr. Elhotson was present. This was answered by\nthree very loud raps. Miss Wynne said to my father,\n\" Did you know him 1\n\" \" Yes,'' was answered in the\nsame manner. The alphabet was then called for, and the\nfollowing message, evidently referring to my father's mes-\nmeric experiences, was given. \"Be as true in this cause\nas you were in bye-gone days for another great truth, John\n\f206 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nEUiotson.'\" After this, raps of different kinds were heard,\nand soon the following message was given by very loud\nones. \" \/ do not ask you to promise, but expect you\nto be earnest in toorking for God.\" Some one remarked,\n\" Who is this message for ?\n\" \" \/ speak to you,'' was\nanswered. \" But, who do you mean by '\nyou '\n1\n\" was\nasked. \" They mean me,\" my father said, \" for I was\ntouched three times on the knee.\" Charlie Wynne having\nbrought the accordion, it was played in Home's hand in\na different style from the previous evening. My father\nheld the accordion, and it was pulled about and played\nfaintly. Home again took it, and the alphabet being asked\nfor by five notes, the following was given\u2014the letters\nbeing indicated by notes :\n\" We will give you a hymn of\npraised A slow measured sort of air was played. My\nfather was talking about Dr. Elliotson, and observed that\nhe had been very kind to him. This message was im-\nmediately given :\n\" You mean you tvere kind to me.\" A\nsofa was now moved near the table, the table also moving\ntowards it, but evidently with much difficulty ; which is\nnot to be wondered at as it was very heavy and standing\non a thick Turkey carpet. My father's chair was moved\nnearer to Home, who said, \" I can see Dr. Elliotson stand-\ning behind your chair, he has both his hands upon the\nback of it, and is causing it to vibrate.\" My father's\nchair was in effect vibrating at the time ; he inquired if\nDr. Elhotson had been at the Castle. \" Yes \" was ans-\nwered by three raps or rather thuds exactly similar to\nthose he had heard at the Castle. Soon after this message\ncame, \" We must go soon.\" My father asked, \" Will Mes-\nmerism make progress 1 it appears to be rather in abey-\nance at present.\" \" Yes \" was loudly answered ; he added\n\" I should like to ask Elhotson some questions about Mes-\nmerism,\" and this message was given, \" By the sea I will\ncome,\" alluding I suppose to our projected visit to Gar-\ninish, on the coast of Kerry. In one of these messages\nthe letters were indicated by touching my father strongly\non the knee. Mrs. Blackburn was also touched on the\nknee. Soon, \" Noiv, God. bless you all,\" was given, the\nletters being indicated by most beautiful chords upon the\n\fNO. 58] With D. D. Home 207\naccordion\u2014the name of God being, as it always is, spelled\nmost softly and reverently. This sentence was then given,\n\" You will sleep all the ftiore peacefully for hiowing that you\nhave done good.'' The raps were much gentler and fainter,\napparently made by quite a different spirit. My father\nsaid \"What does this message refer to?\" Mrs. Black-\nburn remarked, \" I suppose to what happened at the\nCastle.\" \" yes \" was answered. Nothing more occurring\nwe left the room. The raps made by Dr. ElUotson\nsounded as loud as if they had been caused by some one\nunder the table striking it with a hammer. A.\nNo. 5^.\u2014March 6th [1869].\nAdare dined in Limerick : after the ladies left the room\nMajor Blackburn, JMr. Home and I commenced talking of\nthe seances which had been held here last winter. I\nremarked that probably L was connected with the\nunsatisfactory occurrences that happened, and that I should\nbe very glad if the matter could in any way be cleared\nup. We heard raps at the north side of the room, and\nMr. Home went over to a side table near where the raps\nhad sounded, and sitting down said, \" I wish, dear spirit,\nyou would tell us about it.\" \" iVo,\" was answered. He\nadded, ''\nLord Dunraven would be gratified if you would\ntell.\" The alphabet was called for, and this message was\ngiven, \" Don't ask.\" Raps were then heard near the table\nin the bay window ; Mr. Home sat down at this table,\ncalUng us to join him, which we did. On the table were\nthree flower pots or vases with flowers, in one was a good-\nsized azalea ; the table vibrated so strongly that the azalea\nshook most visibly. We soon received this message :\n\" Place the flowers under the table, near John.'' We put\ndown, as directed, one of the flower pots which contained\ncyclamens. Raps were heard upon the table. I said to\nBlackburn, \" Get under the table and hold Mi\\ Home s\nfeet.\" He did so, and we heard the raps distinctly over\nhis head. Mr. Home suddenly said, \"Oh, look at the\n\f208 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nhand near me holding a flower !\n\" Twice he said that he\nsaw the hand. I, somehow, instinctively, put my hand\nunder the table, and immediately felt a flower placed very\ngently in it. The following was then given :\n\u2014\" The flower\nis from Augusta, ivith fond love.'\" Then another sentence\nwas begun, which I could not well make out, and then\n\"a. (Z.\" No more raps occurring after this we left the\ntable. On bringing the paper to the candles on the dining\ntable I found that the word I had not recognized was\n(as written) \" Augutsta.\" I had made a mistake, inserting\na t. The a. d. were, I presume, initials.\nIn accordance with what we were told last night, we\nhad no seance this evening, but, as directed, we went to\nthe Abbey. Soon after arriving there, Adare joined us on\nhis return from Limerick. Mr. Home was very lively, and\nnot at all impressed. He remarked that the influence was\nqviite different to-night. He shortly took Adare and me\nto the kitchen, and after a few turns up and down, he\nwent into a trance. I walked with him, holding his hands.\nHe said he was being touched, and so was I several times,\nvery palpably on the back. He said that there were no\nspirits belonging to the place present, only those connected\nwith us ; we soon turned our steps homewards. Mr. Home\nand Adare walked together, and before awaking, Mr. Home\nspoke something to this effect, \" You remarked how different\neverything felt in the Abbey to-night, to what it did the\nlast time we were there. To-night, although the elements\nwere disturbed, and the wind blowing, everything was\nquiet ; no birds were flying about ; the whole place seemed\npeaceful, whereas the other night, although it was per-\nfectly calm and still, yet the birds, not night birds only,\nbut seemingly others, were flitting about, and the whole\nplace seemed filled with an unquiet influence. It is\nchanged now ; he (referring to the monk) is in a happier\nstate, he can speak to those about you ; he has no ob-\njection to your mentioning what occurred in your room\nwhen he first came. Oh, he does not the least mind\nnow.\"\nWe were sitting in the hall after taking a little supper,\nwhen Mr. Home went to the piano and played, and asked\n\fNO. 59] With D. D. Home 209\nAdare to come and sit by him. Adare now called me to\njoin them. Mr. Home remarked that the piano had been\noff the ground, which Adare affirmed, stating that he had\npassed his hand under the castors ; I felt it vibrating very\nstrongly. His playing became fainter and fainter, and he\nwent into a trance. He got up, said to Adare, \" Bring\nEmily,\" and taking me by the hand led me quickly down\nthe dark passage to Lady D's. sitting room, the others\nfollowing. He placed chairs for us all, drew over a little\ntable, and sat down. It was pitch dark. Immediately a\nhand was laid on the back of my head. He said, \" They\nwill touch you with flowers.\" Both Mrs. Wynne and I\nfelt them. He said to Mrs. Wynne, \" It was John who\ntouched you.\" We heard at a little distance the soimd\nof flowers being stirred and broken, and immediately some\nwere placed in our hands. Mr. Home said, \" Take Daniel's\nhands, dear Emily, we want you to be able to tell others\nthat you held his hands, and felt his feet.\" While Mr.\nHome's hands and feet were thus in contact with Mrs.\nWynne's, we all simultaneously felt flowers waved across\nour faces, heads, and hands. Mrs. Wynne put up her\nhand to try and grasp them, but failed. Mr. Home\nlaughed, and said, \" No, Emily, you cannot catch it\u2014we\ndo not wish you to yet.\" Flowers were then given to\nus all ; Adare received a white azalea with this message,\nthrough Mr. Home, \" For Florence.\" Then another flower\nwas given us, with the message, \" This for Augusta, and\nleaves or a flower for all the dear ones\u2014for all the\nchildren. We wish to say one word if you will call the\nalphabet, Adare.\" He did so, and \" Love \" was given, by\na flower placed in my hand, the stalk being pulled for\neach letter. I tried to feel the hand, but the flower was\ndrawn back by the stem, till my arm was stretched out.\nWe all then observed a light, resembling a httle star, near\nthe chimney piece, moving to and fro ; it then disappeared.\nMr. Home said, \" Ask them in the name of the Father,\nthe Son, and the Holy Ghost, if this is the work of God.\"\nI repeated the words very earnestly ; the light shone out,\nmaking three little flashes, each one about a foot higher\nabove the floor than the preceding. Mr. Home said,\nQ\n\f210 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\n\" We are able to make it brighter and stronger, because\nyou asked solemnly, and in the name of God.\" We then\nheard a sound of something moving, and a shower of\nflowers fell upon us. Loud raps announced the presence,\nas we supposed, of Dr. Elliotson. Mr. Home (or Dr. Elliot-\nson speaking through him), uttered a short and beautiful\naddress, which, unfortunately we cannot recall ; but he\nmade use of a simile ending with the words,\n\u2014\" As the\nsand on the shore.\" I felt a little heap of sand laid\nupon the back of my hand. In his address he said, \"You\nhave been baptized in the name of the Father, the Son,\nand the Holy Ghost ; be now baptized as a truth seeker.\"\nI then felt a drop of some liquid fall on my head. Mr.\nHome then said, \" Emily, would you like to feel the sand 1\n\"\nMrs. Wynne rephed, \" Yes ;\n\" and a small quantity was\nplaced on the back of her hand. He then said, \" Emily,\nyou will feel a kiss on the brow, and also on the lips.\"\nShe felt something, which she afterwards described as more\nresembling two moist fingers than an ordinary kiss. I asked,\n\" What spirits are here ?\n\" Mr. Home answered, \" Augusta,\nEmily's father, mother, and brother ; also others.\" Mrs.\nWynne seemed grieved at the absence of one very dear to\nher : Mr. Home in a subsequent seance, at Garinish, (p. 212)\nalluded to this. He then addressed us and those dearest\nto us in very afi^ectionate terms, and seemed very happy ;\nhe ended by saying, \" We have been so pleased at being\nable to make these manifestations. You did not witness\nmuch at the Abbey, nor did we promise that you would ;\nwhat we wanted was to keep you up late enough for\nthis, and it has happened as we wished. And now, dar-\nlings, you will return to the hall, and sit by Daniel at\nthe piano ; Daniel's power is becoming exhausted ; there\nwill probably be no manifestations to-morrow evening, but\nwe will let him know ; he is not very well, but he does\nnot like saying so.\" We then got up, went back to the\nhall, and sat down as directed at the piano ; Mr. Home\nawoke almost immediately. It was half-past three o'clock.\nI took a candle and returned to the room we had been\nin ; I found the little table and the ground about it\nstrewed with flowers. The table on which the flower pots\n\fNO. 59] With D. D. Home 211\nstood was about eight feet distant from the other ; there\nwas a good deal of sand in the flower pots. Adare and\nI went up to Mr. Home's room, and smoked a cigarette ;\nMr. Home was in bed. We began talking about Spirit-\nualism, and I said, \" I am quite sure that L was\nconcerned in what went on last winter here.\" ^ \" Yes\n\"\nwas suddenly said by three distinct raps in a distant part\nof the room. I made other remarks, which were similarly\njoined in by raps ; but I was very tired, and cannot\nsufficiently recall them to insert them here. D.\nNo. m.\u2014QarinisJi, March 9th [1869].\nWhile my father. Home, and I were at dinner, we all\nfelt a current of cold air, and the table vibrated. This\noccurred two or three times, and seemed to be interrupted\nby the servants coming in and out. At about ten o'clock.\nHome joined me m the dining room, where I was writing\nalone, lie seemed uneasy and I asked him if he was not\nfeehng well. \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"I am quite well ; but there\nis a strange influence about that I do not know.\" Shortly\nafter, raps came upon the table, and the following messages\nwere given. \" Oiving to conditions, ive fear ive shall not be\nable before Thursday ; but we will try to-morroiv. Humphrey\nMay:' \" Use this table.\" \" Tell Uncle (word confused)\nnot to be over anxious.'' I took the messages to my father,\nand he joined us in the dining room, observing how curious\nit was that Humphrey May should come, that he had\nnever been with us before, that he had never been at\nGarinish, and that he could not understand why he came.\n\" There is one,\" he said, \" that I should have supposed\nwould have come here before all others, and I should also\nhave thought Dr. Elhotson would have made some com-\nmunication, because he told us the other night at Adare\nthat he would do so.\" We began talldng about some\nseances that were held at Adare, without Home, alluding\nparticularly to one, the written account of which Home\n1 I subseqviently found that the occurrences to whicli I alhided, chiefly\ntook place before L arrived at Adare.\n\f212 Experiences in S'piritualism [seance\nhappened to be holding in his hand. The alphabet was\ncalled for, and this message given :\n\" The wriiing that you\nhold in your hand is all nonsense.\" Soon after, Home\nwent into a trance ; he got up and said, \" The light is\ntoo strong for Dan.\" I blew the candles out, leaving a\ngood fire-light m the room, and began searching for a\npencil to take notes. He said, \" The hght will do nicely\nnow, never mind about taking notes, you will be able to\nrecord what Dan says better without doing so ; we will\nendeavour to impress you with it to-morrow, and you will\nremember the substance, if not the exact words ;\nby trusting\nentirely to us, we shall be able to assist you more than\nif you took notes, and trusted to them ; what I am going\nto say now is important, you must try and remember it.\nCertain conditions are necessary for us to be able to make\nany manifestations ;\nby conditions, I mean not only the\nstate of the external atmosphere, but also the state of\nyour minds and bodies ; certain electrical conditions are\nnecessary. Now, it often happens that some spirit\u2014though\npossibly a perfect stranger to all of yow\u2014is possessed of\nthe particular quahty that is necessary to supply a de-\nficiency and make the conditions favourable, he would then\nbe called in. Sometimes three or four of them club\ntogether, and by that means supply something that is\nwanting, or take away some quality that is in -excess,\nand equahze the atmosphere so as to be able to make\nmanifestations. Those spirits that love you best, that are\nmost anxious to communicate, that would naturally be\nnearest and dearest to you, may not have the peculiar\nquahty that is necessary to harmonize with the condition\nof yourselves, and of the external atmosphere on any par-\nticular day, and they cannot then make communications ;\nit is impossible, for it is all a matter of physical conditions ;\nthey are then obliged to comrniinicate through other spirits\nwho harmonize with the existing conditions. That is one\nreason why Humphrey May came to-night. You often\nwonder why those you love best do not come to you, it\nis simply because the conditions are such that they cannot\nmake themselves known. Now the other night the spirit\nthat Emily was anxious about was standing outside the\n\fNO. 60] With D. D. Home 213\ncircle, Emily thought it most strange that she did not say\nanything to her, but if she had entered the circle it would\nhave entirely destroyed the arrangements, and there could\nhave been no more manifestations ; it is svxrely better to\nhave any communications than none at all. This explains\nalso why it is generally a bad plan to ask questions ;\nafter things have been arranged, some spirit steps into the\ncu'cle to answer a question, and not being in harmony,\nthe whole thing is thrown out of gear. It is hke making\ndehcate experiments in electricity ; or like photography\n\u2014\nto go no further than that, if, when you are mixing your\nchemicals in a dark room, one single ray of hght enters,\nall is destroyed ; so it is where a spirit enters the circle\nwhose physical condition does not harmonize with the\nstate of the atmosphere, and of your minds and bodies.\nThe conditions are very bad to-night ;\nyou saw what\ndifficulty we had in giving those messages, the raps were\nfeeble and uncertain (we had observed this), the word\n'\nUncle '\nought to have been '\nDunraven '\n; we spelled out\n'\ndun,' and then the letters became all confused, we could\nnot indicate the right ones. You heard those raps that\ncame afterwards\u2014you would scarcely believe that they\nwere made by Dr. Elhotson, so different were they from\nthose he usually makes ;\nyet so it was. Oh ! there has\nbeen a curious influence here all the afternoon\u2014an old\nman, his name is Thomas\u2014Thomas Trench ; he has a\nbald head\u2014a large bald head.\" My father asked if he\nhad come with Towny Trench. \" Yes, he came with him ;\nhe belongs to him. Dr. Elhotson says, that if the con-\nditions are favourable, he wants to make some experiments\non Thursday ; he is so anxious about it, he wants to\ninvent some more perfect means of keeping up a constant\ncommunication ; it is very doubtful if he will ever succeed.\nHe knows your mind, Dunraven, and he would like to\nmake his experiments with you ; he is very much\ninterested in the matter, and so will you be also when\nyou join us ;\nyou will take a great pleasure in experi-\nmentahzing.\" Home then went to the door of the drawing\nroom, made a gesture of disapproval, and said, pushing\nthe door open as he spoke, \" No, you must not do that,\n\f214 Experiences vit, Spiritualism, [seance\nplease.\" We heard a dull sound in the drawing room.\nHome laughed and said, \" That is Thomas, he does not\napprove of your investigations, and he thought he would\nmake a very terrible noise in there, that would frighten\nyou and put a stop to it all and destroy the conditions ;\nbut he cannot do so.\" I said, \" Why on earth does he\ndisapprove ; do you not mean Henry Thomas ?\n\" \" Oh\ndear no, he is a great experimentalizer in electricity ;\nno,\nI mean the Thomas I told you of, Thomas Trench.\"\nI said, \" Why does he object ?\n\" \" Oh, it is entirely\nagainst his principles, and ho thought he would make a\nvery weird horrible noise and frighten you, and stop it.\"\nMy father said, \" Will he then seek to influence Towny\nagainst Spirituahsm ?\n\" \" Most decidedly he will ;\noh,\nmost decidedly. There is another reason besides that\nwhich I have already mentioned, why Humphrey May\ncame to us to-night. It is true that he was never here ;\nbut his brother Arthur has been, and will be here again.\nArthur has, or rather had, no real reUgious opinions ; he\nwas not accustomed to pray ; his heart was not softened\nand lifted to God in prayer. When he hears what\noccurred to-night, it will have an effect upon him. He\nknows that Dan, I mean Dan Home, could never have\nheard of Humphrey, that Humphrey was never here, and\nwas probably the last person in the world that any of\nyou were thinlsing of ; and the fact of his coming will\nstrike Arthur the more forcibly ; it will be hke a little\ntest to him. Besides this, he was very fond of you,\nDuiu-aven, and also of Adare.\" After this, Home sat by\nthe fire making passes, and magnetizing his wrist. He\nsaid, \" Daniel's wrist is swelling, and hurts him.\" He\nthen walked over towards the window, and stretching out\nhis arm, we heard a sound as of some one's fingers snap-\nping near it. He said, \" That is Dr. Elhotson magnetizing\nDan's hand.\" Home placed his hand upon my head,\nbut immediately said, \" No, your father will do better,\"\nand placed it on his head. He said, \" Listen \" ; and my\nfather heard rajis upon the hand. Home took the sheet\non which the seance before mentioned was written, and\nasked us to hold it by the corners with him ; we did so.\n\fNO. 60] With D. D. Home 215\nand raps came upon it ; then lifting up the sheet of\npaper, he said, \"It is all black now ; there is a good\ndeal that is not right here, there is more in it than you\nsee. Now, do you thinly that if a person were to parti-\ncipate and help in doing something wi'ong, and, when the\nothers were suspected, were to keep silence, and let them\nbear all the blame, do you think that person would be\nright ?\n\" My father rephed, \" No, I think they would be\nvery wrong.\" \" And so do we,\" Home said, and throwing\nthe paper down, added, \" You see where we have thrown\nit 1\n\" \" On the floor,\" I said. \" Yes, just in front of\nthe fu'e.\" I was going to put the paper in the fire,\nbut my father thought we had better keep it. Home\nsaid, \" Oh, certainly, keep it ; it is interesting if only as\na psychological study ;\nyou will, however, lose it some\nday.\" Soon after this. Home awoke. Although I had\nblown out the candles when Home went into the trance ;\nthe room was well lighted all the time by the fire.\nA.\nNo. Ql.\u2014Seance, March Uth [1869j.\nThis evening while Mrs. Blackburn, Home, and myself\nwere sitting reading in the drawing room, raps came upon\nthe table. Soon after, we, that is Major and Mi's. Black-\nburn, my father, Home, and myself, at Home's suggestion\nsat round the table that we had been told on Tuesday\nnight to use. We had slight physical manifestations, the\ntable was made hght and heavy at request, and was\ntilted three times towards each of us. The spirits occa-\nsionally answered our remarks as to what they were doing,\nwhether they were endeavouring to concentrate the power,\n&c., &c., by affirmative or negative tilts. Mrs. Blackburn\nbeconung slightly under influence, and a good deal agitated.\nHome asked if the spirits would take it from her ? The\nanswer was by two raps meaning \" perhaps \" or presently.'''\nHe afterwards placed his hands upon hers, and the\nshaking left her, and was communicated to him. Home\nnow went into one of those strange trances in which he\n\f216 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nis unable to speak ; he bandaged his eyes with a hand-\nkerchief, walked about the room a little, tlien brought the\ncandle, two sheets of paper and a pencil, and placing\nthem on our table, sat down ; then spreading open one\nof the sheets he commenced writing the alphabet on it\nin large capital letters. He proceeded with a firm bold\ntouch as far as the letter F, when his hand became\nviolently tremulous, he went on to the letter L, the shak-\ning of his fingers gradually increasing, when he made a\ngesture as if he could not proceed, and handed the paper\nand pencil to me. I finished the alphabet. He then,\nfollowing the lines that I had made, traced over the\nletters R, S, T, U, V, W, with the same tremulous motion\nof his hand, and proceeded to decorate with leaves and\nflowers the letters A, G, S, T, U. He drew a cross in\nthe letter U, a heart pendant on T, a star or double\ncross in 8, an anchor in G, sometlung resembling a bird\nin A, and marked the letters A and U with the figure 2.\nHe then got up and fetched a pen, handed me a fresh\nsheet of paper and the pencil, turned the alphabet towards\nmy father, sat down and gave us the following messages,\nby indicating the letters with the pen. \"We hope to have\ngreat power, God being our helper.\" \" You see ivhat ones\nthey are.\" None of us could understand what the last\nsentence \" You see ivhat ones they are \" referred to.\nHome spelled out \" The ones ive have decorated.\" We\nthen, on looking at the alphabet, found that the decorated\nletters spelled \" Augusta,\" the letters A and U, which\noccur twice in the word, being marked twice in the word,\nbeing marked on the alphabet by the numeral 2. Home\ngot up and went into the dining room, where we had\nbeen smoking after dinner, but returned immediately,\nmuch affected\u2014as we supposed, by the tobacco smoke ;\nhe appeared to have difficulty in breathing, was much\ndistressed, and groped about as if he could not see :\n^ he\ncaught hold of my hand and sat dow^n. I observed that\nhe was affected by something, and consequently the\nspirits had lost perfect control over him ; Home nodded,\n^ The effect of the tobacco smoke m partially obstructing the clair-\nvoyant power was very curious to witness.\n\u2014\nD.\n\fNO. 61] With D. D. Home 217\nas much as to say, that is the case. He got up, went\ninto the open air for a few minutes and returned quite\nright. He then made us leave our places, moved the\ntable close to the -window, placed the accordion on the\nwindow shelf, and spelt out by the written alphabet,\n\" Bring in the doth.'' I accordingly brought the cloth\nfrom the dining room, covered our table with it, and sat\ndown. On my father remarking that he had not spoken\nin the trance, Home made him and Mrs. Blackburn feel\nhis jaws : they were locked and perfectly rigid ; he then\nsat down, and shortly after awoke. We had a series of\ncurious but not very powerful manifestations ;\nthe window\ncurtains were drawn partially across the window, and in\nanswer to the suggestion of one of us that perhaps the\nspirits did this to cover the accordion on which possibly\nthey might be about to try and play, \" Yes \" was rapped\nout. Home saw on tliree or four occasions, and my\nfather saw once, httle flashes of light plajdng over the\nkeys of the accordion. We heard that a small table\nbehind Home was moving, and after the semice, we found\nit had been lifted on to the sofa. The table was now\nraised in that peculiar manner which we had remarked at\nAdare, by successive lifts (five or six of them), to the\nheight of about two feet, and then gently set down ;\nafter which, \" Take the instrnment \" was spelled. My\nfather remarked that we might expect music, as this\naction of the table\u2014imitating so curiously that of the\nbellows of the organ when being filled, usually preceded\nit.i Home took the accordion, and it played for a short\ntime, chiefly harmonies. He then placed it on the ground,\nwhen a few chords and notes were played. We heard\nraps on the table, floor, walls, and outside the window ;\nand the spirits occasionally joined in our conversation by\nrapping, \" Yes \" or \" No.\" At one time we were specu-\nlating as to how Mr. Mahony would treat the subject of\nSpirituaUsm, and some one said that he would not judge\nof it fairly, for that he would condemn it at once with-\nout an}' investigation ; the following message was immedi-\n1 That this was the object aimed at by this peculiar motion of the\ntable was afterwards told us.\n\f218 Experienced in Spiritualimi. [seance\nately given :\n\" Jndge not lest ye be judged.\" I observed\nthat the manifestations were weak ; and that there\nappeared to be some obstruction, when this was given :\n\" Be prayerfid.\" We recognized Dr. Elhotson's presence\nby his pecuhar raps. Mrs. Blackburn remarked that they\nwere not so loud as they had been in the gallery at\nAdare. He spelled out the word, \" servants,\" implying\nprobably that if he were to rap as forcibly here as he\nhad done at Adare, the servants might hear him, being\nin a room nearly under us. Home again became en-\ntranced ; he got up, and put out the candle, so that\nthe room was lighted only by a bright tire. My father\nsaid to me, \"It is curious that we have not had stronger\nmanifestations, because the first message we received was\nto the effect that they would have great power.\" Home\nsaid, \" You are mistaken, we said '\nwe hope to have great\npower ' ; we have to harmonize and arrange the room,\nwe shall ])e able to do more another night. Dunraven,\nyou were remarking that when Dan ,was in a trance no\nphysical manifestations ever occurred ; do you and Maria\n(Mrs. Blackburn) come here.\" He made them stand by\na small heavy table in the centre of the room. My\nfather said, \" I thought Dr. Elliotson wished to try some\nexperiments with me.\" Home answered, \" Yes, this is\none of the experiments ; he is very anxious also to be\nable to communicate with you when you are quite alone,\nhe does not know whether he can, but he will try and\ndevelop you sufficiently for that.\" They then had a\nseries of the usual manifestations, raps, and vibrations,\nthe table tilting in different directions, and being twice\nraised shghtly off the ground. Home was very particular\nin making them observe closely the position of his hands\nand feet, in order, as he said, \" That you may be able\nto assure others that Dan could not possibly have done\nall this.\" Suddenly the small table rose quickly into the\nair to such a height, that Mi's. Blackburn and my father\ncould no longer keep their hands upon it ; it rose so\nsuddenly that Mrs. Blackburn gave a start. The table\nbeginning to fall. Home said, \" Take it, or it will fall.\"\nWhen they had placed it on the ground, Home observed,\n\fKO. 61] With D. D. Home 219\n\" That was badly managed, it is a great pity but it is\nour fault ; Dr. ElUotson says he ought to have told you\nwhat he was going to do, Maria was startled and you\nboth let go, and therefore the table fell ; if he had\nwarned you, and you had allowed your hands to shp\ndown the legs as it rose, so as not to break the con-\ntinuity suddenly, it would probably have left your hands,\nand risen without contact with you until it touched the\nceihng.^ We will try and do it again ; Adare and John,\ncome here.\" We joined them, and Home told us all to\nplace our fingers lightly under the edge of the table in\norder that we might let them shde down the legs with-\nout ever quite taking them off it. The table rose to a\nheight of about three feet, but came to the ground again\ndirectly, and fell over on its side ; Home told us not to\nmove it, but presently he said \" Yes, put it on its legs,\nwe have not power now ; the influence has returned to\nthe large table, go back to your places.\" We did so,\nand the Major not finding a chair near him, and the\nHght being by this time faint, Home put one into his\nhand. The Major was going to sit down upon nothing,\nas he had by mistake placed the chair with the seat\nturned away from him ; Home stopped him saying, \" No,\nno. Major, you are going to sit on the wrong side of the\nchair.\" We all laughed and Home joined in, \" That\nwas very funny, was it not ? very funny to see John\ntrjdng to sit down at the back of the chair.\" Home\nthen took his seat, and said, \"Dr. EEiotson was anxious\nto try the experiment, and to see whether he could make\nmanifestations when Dan was in a trance, and he suc-\nceeded ;\nyou had all the usual phenomena, the levitation\nof the table, raps, tiltings, and vibrations, but it required\na great effort to do it ; it is much more difficult, because\nthe greater part of the influence is centred upon Dan\nwhile he is mesmerised. We are just as anxious as you\nare, Dumraven, to pass through the present phase of\nmanifestations, but we must do our appointed work, and\nyou will find that ultimately it is all for the best. It\nwould be much pleasanter to converse with you and\n^ The room is about ten or eleven feet high.\n\f220 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nanswer yovir questions ; but then, however well we might\nanswer them, people would account for that, by all sorts\nof theories, such as mind-reading, &c., &.c. Now, no\namount of clairvoyance or mind-reading would suffice to\nraise a table in the air higher than your heads. We\nmust fulfil our appointed duties and you will know some\nday that it is all for the best.\" Home began to laugh\nand said, \" It was very funny John's turning the chair\nthe wrong way ;\nyour godmother (speaking to Mrs.\nBlackburn) is laughing so about it, it recalls another\nincident. You know John's mother has answered his\nletter, but she has not answered his question about\nIsabella ; she and John's sist\u00abr purposely would not do\nso, because they said, \" it will never do to have John\nturning everything upside down in this sort of way.\" It\namused Dr. Elliotson very much, that did ; he was there\nwhen thej said so. Dr. Elhotson is fond of you. Major\n(taking the Major's hand and shaking it cordially) ; he\nhkes you very much ; he says you are so steadfast, and\nan honest, brave man. Dan is going to awake now.\"\nAfter Home awoke, we had some slight manifestations,\nwhich gradually died away. Home said he felt that the\ninfluence had entirely gone, and that he was fatigued.\nIn speaking about the answer to the letter. Home referred\nto his having at Adare, when in a trance, told Major\nBlackburn to ask his mother about Isabella, and about\nMargaret Henderson {vide p. 190). No one had told Home\nthat an answer had been received, or even that the Major\nhad written. A.\nNo. G2.\u2014Seance, March 12th [1869].\nAbout half-past nine o'clock, Home proposed a seance.\nWe placed the table by the window, in the position to\nwhich it had been moved the previous night, and covered\nit with a cloth. The party consisted of Major and IMrs.\nBlackburn, my father. Home, and myself. We had no\nmanifestations whatever ; and after sitting for half-an-\nhour xny father said he thought there was no use in\n\fNO. 62] With D. D. Home 221\nwaiting any longer, having for a certain reason a strong\nfeeling that nothing would occur. Home said that\nalthough he had often known seances to fail as regards\nmanifestations, yet in all his experience he never remembered\na room to feel so entirely devoid of any spiritual presence.\nAt his suggestion, we all, with the exception of Mrs.\nBlackburn, took a walk out of doors for about a quarter\nof an hour. On our return we again sat round the table,\nbut Mrs. Blackburn, not feeling very well, did not join\nus. We had no manifestations whatever ; and after\nwaiting a short time gave it up in despair. My father\nand Mrs. Blackburn went into the dining room ; the\nMajor, Home, and I remained and sat at a small table,\nto see if we could get any message. Almost immediately\nfaint raps came ujDon the table, and the word \" Impossible\n\"\nwas spelled out. We joined the others, and told them\nwhat had occurred. Mrs. Blackburn went to bed, and\nwe were sitting round the supper table talking, when\nI suddenly felt a current of cold air. Home also per-\nceived it, and said, \" There is a strong influence about\nme.\" We heard raps on the table and fvu'niture. Presently,\nat Home's suggestion, we returned to the next room, and\nagain sat round the small table. We had faint physical\nmanifestations ; Home became under influence, and his\nhands were much agitated. He had been complaining\nduring the evening of a feehng of great depression ; he\nnow said that he felt all right. He got up, and acting\nimder an uncontrollable impulse, walked about the room,\nhis hands and arms being strangely waved about and\nagitated ; he made mesmeric passes over us all, and said\n(referring more especially to my father), Your brains are\noverworked, you have had your thoughts too much con-\ncentrated on one subject, and have been writing too\nmuch. (We had been engaged in recording the seances\nat Adare.) The atmosphere that sijirits utiUze in making\nmanifestations emanates from the head, and in consequence\nof your brains being overworked, there is absolutely none\nflowing from you.\" He made passes for some time over\nmy father's forehead, the back of his head, and behind\nhis ears, occasionally going to the table at which we had\n\f222 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\npreviously been seated, and extending his fingers over it\nas though withdrawing some influence from it. While\nwalking about he suddenly stopped in the middle of a\nsentence with a violent gasp, and sinking on his knees\nwent into a trance. He got up, walked about, apparently\nconversing with some one, and then, taking each of us in\nturn by the hand, led us to the other table, placed chairs\nfor us, and signed to us to sit down. My father requested\nme to bring paper and a pencil ; but Home shook his\nhead, and afterwards brought them himseK. He then\ncommenced arranging the furniture in the most minute\ndetail, consulting apparently all the time with some one.\nHe placed the small round table near us and behind my\nfather, and moved a chair up to it ; he altered the\nposition of several of the chairs in different parts of\nthe room, placed the miniature portrait of his wife on\nthe small round table, and the case containing little\nDannie Cox's photograph on the large table behind me,\nthen going to the bookcase he took out several books,\nlooked into them and replaced them ; at length he\nappeared to find what he wanted, for he took out a\nvolume, folded his hands across it on his breast, and\nafter standing for a few seconds in a most reverential\nattitude, sank down upon his knees and appeared to\npray earnestly ; then rising to his full height he held the\nbook as high as he could above his head and placed it\nupon our table. On looking at the volume afterwards we\nfound it to be, \" Jesus Christ ; His Times, Life, and\nWork,\" by E. de Pressense. He again commenced mak-\ning mesmeric passes about the room. Coming to me he\npassed his hand sharply across my shoulders from left to\nright, did the same to Major Blackburn, then to my\nfather, and finally to himself ; then reversing the action,\nhe commenced with himself making the pass from right\nto left, and went over us all in the same way ; this\ncurious movement he repeated three times. He now put\nout the candle, leaving us with no other fight but that\nof the fire, rubbed his hands, smiled, and nodded when\nI remarked that I thought we should have some mani-\nfestations as he seemed to be contented. Having taken\n\fNO. 62] With D. D. Home 223\nhis seat he altered the position of two vases of flowers\non the table in such a way as to make, with the book,\nwhich he placed back upwards transversely between them,\nthe form of a cross. The accompanying diagram shews\nthe arrangement of the various articles. They are marked\nby capital letters in their original jjositions, while the\naltered places of those that were moved, are indicated by\nsmall letters.\nHome awoke, and we had all the usual physical pheno-\nmena ;\nvery strong currents of cold air, vibrations of the\ntable, &c., &c. On two occasions during the seance, the\ntable was raised about a foot in the air and remained\nthere poised for some time, oscillating gently from side to\nside. We now all heard a movement about vase N, and\nHome and I both saw a hand upon it ; I said that the\nvase was moving ; Home insisted that it was not, and\nrequested me to place my hand upon it ; I did so, and\nfound that it was moving slowty round, but the sound\nwe heard was caused by the hand rubljing against the\nside of the vase ; I saw the hand all the time. We\nnow heard a rusthng among the flowers, and Home said,\n\" The fingers have closed over a flower and taken it\naway.\" I did not see the flower taken, but the hand at\nthat moment disappeared. Home and I both observed a\nhand rise above the edge of the table near the window,\nand place a flower upon it ; I then lost sight of the hand,\nbut Home said he saw it carry the flower across the\ntable, and place it near my father ;\nmy father saw the\nflower all the time moving as it were of itself, for he\ncould not distinguish the hand that conveyed it. He\ntook the flower, and asked if it was for him. The\nfollowing was speUed out :\n\" Yes and tve ivill give you\nanother soon.'\" My father remarking that he was very\nanxious to see a hand, the following messages were given :\n\" Place your hand over the floivers.'' He did so over\nvase N, and we all heard\u2014and my father, Home, and I,\nsaw, a hand moving among the flowers. \" Noio an them.\"\nHe did so, and the hand became much more distinctly\nvisible to him. I said to my father, \" I su^jpose you\nwere told to place your hand there in order that they\n\f224 Exjyeriences in Spiritualism [seance\nmight draw some power from you to enable them to make\nthe hand sufficiently material for you to see it distinctly.\"\n\" Yes,'' was answered by three loud raps. Sacha's\n(Home's wife's) miniature was now carried from table B,\nand placed upon our table ; none of us saw anything\nsupporting it, but we observed it placed quietly upon\nHome's hands, and then gliding off them it moved across\nthe table vmtil it remained stationary on the corner near\nthe wdndow. The case was closed when Home put it\nupon table B, at the commencement of the seance ; it\nwas open when laid upon our table. Home and I now\ndistinctly saw a hand place little Dannie Cox's photo-\ngraph (I) on the edge of our table next the window, and\nthen push it a little further on to the table. It will be\nremembered that this photograph was placed by Home at\nthe commencement of the seance on table D. Home\nand I perceived a whole arm and hand between our\ntable and the window, it was slightly lummous, and\nappeared whiter than the white tablecloth. The hand\npushed the accordion, F, along the shelf S, and then\ngrasping it, took it off ; the accordion fell, but not\nheavily, to the ground. All saw and heard the accordion\nmoved. Home said, \" I am sure that was little Dannie,\nbecause I saw a small figure ; his shoulders were plainly\nvisible ;\napparently he had not power sufficient to enable\nhim to carry the mstrument gently to the ground.\" This\nwas spelled out, \" Yes, it was Dannie.'\" Previous to the\naccordion moving, the muslin curtains were drawn out so\nas partially to hide it ; this required some force to effect,\nas the curtain rings did not run easily on the hne. A\nvery pretty manifestation now occurred ; Home called my\nfather's attention to the fact, that the reflection of a\nhand was visible on the glass, covering his wife's minia-\nture. My father also saw it, but was not sure whether it\nwas the reflection or the actual hand ; he placed his own\nhand just above the glass, and still saw in it the reflection\nof a small hand, moving backwards and forwards. He\nsaid, \"I see it distinctly, the fingers are small and\ndelicate.\" He asked whose hand it was, and the follow-\ning was spelled out, \"The fingers are those of Caroline.\"\n\f\f226 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nThe accordion was carried under the table to Home ; he\ntook it, and a short, but very beautiful harmony was\nplayed. Home replaced it on the floor, and chords were\nheard, when no one was touching it. In some of the\nmessages also the letters were indicated, by notes played\non the accordion. The following was now given. \" Seek\nrather to know tlie qyresent condition of the immortal soul (the\nword soul being emphasized) than,\" here the message\nbroke off abruptl}^ Home repeated the alphabet twice,\nand nothing occurred ; but while saying it over the third\ntime, a hand placed a book on the table ; the message\nthen continued, \" In good time, and with God's j:)ermission,\nthe one loill elucidate the other.\" On looking at the book,\nwe found it to be \" Primeval Man,\" by the Duke of\nArgyle. The message would therefore appear to mean,\n\" Seek rather to know the present condition of the immortal\nsoul, tliayi to specvilate about that of primeval man ; in\ngood time, and. with God's permission, the one will elucidate\nthe other.\" The book, \" Primeval Man \" was at the\ncommencement of the seance lying on a table in the centre\nof the room, at a distance of six or eight feet from us.\nThe second flower that was promised to my father was\nnow placed on the table near his hand ; none of us saw\nanything supporting it, bvit Home perceived the flower\nmoving in the air. A flower came from the direction of\nwhere Home was sitting towards me ; it dropped on the\nedge of the table close to me, and fell on the floor : I\nsaw it in the air. Home and I perceived a hand place\nsomething on the shelf under the window, and we saw a\nhand with a flower raised above the side of the table\nnext the window ; Home stretched out his hand towards\nit, and the flower dropped on the floor. Both my father\nand Home were repeatedly touched ; I also, on four\noccasions, was most palpably touched by a hand patting\nmy knee. Some one remarked that Major Blackburn had\nnot been touched, soon after he declared that he felt a\nhand touch his knee ; he asked who it was, and the\nname \" John \" was spelled. I said, \" Do you know who\nJohn is?\" he rephed, \"My father's name was John, but\nI do not know whether it was he that touched me.\"\n\fNO. 62] With D. D. Home 227\nThe words, \" Yes, your father,'''' were spelled ; and then,\n\" We ivish John also to see the hand ; place your hand\nabove, and then on, the floivers.\" Major Blackburn did so ;\nwe all heard the flowers rustling, and Home and I saw\nthe hand doing it. The Major saw nothing while his\nhand was over the flowers ; but when he touched them, he\nalso saw the hand, though indistinctly. We now heard\nloud raps upon the small table C, and looking round,\nfound that it had been hfted up and placed upon the\nsofa E at c ; so quietly was it done that we should not\nhave noticed it, had the spirits not called our attention\nby rapping upon it. My father asked if they had moved\nit in the same way last night ; the answer was, \" Yes.\"\nThe chair G was moved up to g, and the table B was\nmoved close to it. The table B was then raised in the\nair (no one touching it), and placed gently, but without\nhesitation, upon our table A. The table B has four\nlegs, like a camp stool ;\nthey rested where the four dots\nare marked, close to the vases, books and portraits, -with-\nout touching any of them. We now felt very strong\nvibrations in our table ; it was tilted from side to side,\nand so strongly towards my father's side, that he put out\nhis hand expecting the small table B to fall over upon\nhim ; but nothing moved. About this time we heard\ncurious sounds in the air ; Home said, Do you hear\ntheir voices ? I will talk, never mind what I say ; the\nmore I talk the plainer you will hear them.\" He went\non speaking for two or three minutes, during which time\nwe heard strange noises Uke high-pitched voices at a little\ndistance, the louder he spoke the louder the sounds\nbecame, they were most peculiar ; we could not hear\nany articulate words. Mrs. Blackburn, who had retired\nto bed in the room under that in which we were sitting,\ntold us next day that she had heard strange sounds ; and\nshe imitated them so well, that we at once recognized\nthat she really had heard the voices. Home then went\ninto a trance, and said, \" We are so very glad to have\nbeen able to effect what has been done for you ; hut the\nstate of the external atmosphere, and the fact of Dan\nbeing ill, are very mucli against us , we have not been\n\f228 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nable to do by any means all that we intended. Dr.\nElliotson was most anxious that you should have some\nmanifestations to-night, he hopes circumstances may be\nmore favourable to-morrow ; he would hke to come to\nyou Dunraven, and talk to you, and enter upon serious\nsubjects. Dan will awake now ; when he does you will\nstay where you are, and Adare will get a candle, that\nyou may note down accurately the position of every-\nthing. We must now go. May God Almighty, in His\ninfinite goodness, for ever lead and guide you nearer and\nnearer to Him.\" Home having awoke, I brought in a\ncandle, and we noted down the position in which we\nfound the different articles that had been moved. Some\ndoubt was expressed as to whether a chair in the middle\nof the room had been stirred ; a spirit rapped three times\nto say \" Yes,'' that it had. A.\nNo. GS.Sea7ice, March ISth [1869.]\nPresent : My father, Home, and myself. Home and\nI had been a good deal affected and depressed to-day by\nthe weather\u2014a strong, drying east wind had been blowing\nfor two or three days. After dinner when seated in the\ndrawing room wo heard raps upon the furniture, and\nHome soon suggested that we should sit round the table.\nI went to my bed room to put on a dressing gown,\nplacing my snuff box (the same heavy silver one men-\ntioned at page 80 in the account of some v^onderful\nmanifestations at Mr. Jones's house, at Norwood) in my\nwaistcoat pocket. On returmng to the drawing room,\nI laid the snuff box (why, I do not know) on a bookcase\nstanding against the wall at the side of the room opposite\nto the window where stood the table at which my father\nand Home were already seated. We had shght physical\nmanifestations, and then Home went into a trance. As\nusual, he began by arranging the furniture ; he placed\nthe small round table between his chair and my father's,\n\fNO. 63] With D. D. Home 229\nand about a foot from our table, laid his wife's miniature\nupon it, and arranged the two vases of flowers in the\nsame positions they had occupied the previous evening.\nHe went over to the bookcase, sat down on the ground,\nand ojjened several books, as if looking for one in par-\nticular. He brought over a small prayer book with a\ncross on it, which he placed on the flowers in the vase\nnear me. He then sat down on the sofa, {vide diagram\nof the room, in last night's seance), and almost immedi-\nately put his hand on the window shelf, touching a book\nwhich was lying there. He gave a shght start, grasped\nthe book, felt it all over, and then with great reverence\nkneeled down, placed the book against his forehead and\non the top of his head, apparently praying earnestly ; he\nthen slowly rose up, and holding the book he extended\nhis arm at full length, and appeared to be raised in the\nair several inches. The table hid his legs and feet, but\nI think it was a case of elevation not elongation, for he\nappeared to be moved a httle forwards, and in becoming\nshorter, he seemed to alight on the floor. He then placed\nthe book on the table in exactly the same position as on\nthe previous evening. I guessed, by the effect the book\nproduced\u2014so similar to what happened last night, that it\nwas the same, viz. Pressense's \" Life of Clurist,\" which\nturned out to be the case. He now took a large railway\nplaid of mine, and placing it over his head and gatlieruig\nit in at the waist so as to resemble a monk's cowl or\nhabit, he commenced walking about the room. He stood\nbetvi^een us and the bookcase with his back to us, and\nwas apparently elongated, but only slightly. He then\nbowed himself repeatedly to the ground ; and was occupied\nfor a Uttle while about his dress, and doing something\nwith his hands which we could not well see as he had\nhis back turned to us ; it appeared as if he were going\nthrough some religious ceremony. The plaid began slip-\nping gradually off him, but was replaced upon his\nshoulders. (Home said afterwards before he awoke that\nthe plaid had been replaced by spirits, I did not notice\nat the time whether he touched it himself or not, and can-\nnot therefore vouch for the fact.) A second time it began\n\f230 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nto slij), and fell to tlie gi'ound ; Home appeared to be\nvery unhappy, and taking the plaid, he placed it on the\nfloor, and seating himself at the end of the sofa, he\nretreated along the edge by starts, his countenance show-\ning indications of great pain, his look being fixed all the\ntime upon the plaid ; then leaning his head upon his\nhand, he rocked himself from side to side. His distress\nwas most painful to witness ; he groaned and sobbed as\nit in despair. After a while he took the \" Life of Christ,\"\nand kneeling down appeared to pray fervently, pressing\nthe book to his forehead. He then sat down and began\nto speak somewhat as follows :\n\" The same spirit is here\nthat visited Adare in his room, and that was in the\nAbbey ; he was very anxious to come to you once more,\nand took this opportunity because you are alone. What\nDan has been doing is intended as an allegory, he (the\nspirit) wished to shew you that when he first took the\nmonkish habit, it raised and elevated him, and the grace\nof God was in him ;\nthen, if you remember, Dan was\nelevated in the air ; afterwards he became less worthy of\nit, and the habit nearly fell off Dan, but was replaced by\nthe spirits ; Dan did not do it himself. But he com-\nmitted a great crime\u2014a grievous sin against God and\nman\u2014and he became altogether unworthy of the habit,\nand it fell from him ; then you saw the misery and\nremorse he felt in thinking of what he had done, and\nhow he had fallen from his former position, and had lost\nall the blessings he ought to have gained ;\nyou saw also\nthe comfort that prayer and the contemplation of the\n\" Life of Christ \" were to him. He was so anxious to\ncome to you again, for he wishes to thank you ; he is\nnot happy, but he is very different to what he was ; then\nall was dark, now he sees a httle gUmnier of the hght of\nhope like a star leading him on. You have prayed for\nhim, you have prayed for all unhappy spirits in the like\ncondition as himself, and it is a comfort to him ; he is\nvery thankful and declares that he will do all he can to\nbe of service to you. He says, '\nI pray you, thanks '\n;\nhe does not talk hke the others, he does not speak Enghsh\nas they do. He is going now and says again, '\nI pray\n\fNO. 63] With D. D. Home 231\nyou, thanks'.\" Home repeated the words, 'I pray you,\nthanks,' two or three times, his voice becoming gradually\nfainter and fainter, as if to signify that the spirit was\nslowly leaving us. He then spoke about our last visit\nto the Abbey at Adare, and our going to Desmond Castle.\nHe said something of this sort :\n\" You made a mistake\nin taking the females to the ruins ; we told you not to\ntake them {vide p. 178) ; and you would have had more\nmanifestations had you not done so. It did not so much\nsignify at the Castle, where the influence is quite different\nfrom that at the Abbey. The influence of rehgion does\nnot exist there, it was a place of warfare, blood was shed\nupon the ground, but the blooi has long since passed by\nchemical operations into various forms, and has dis-\nappeared ; all the associations are gone, there was no\nabiding influence about that place ; even the chapel was\nnot the same as the Abbey, for it was only in times of\ndanger that rehgious services were conducted there. The\nAbbey is very different, there the ground is hallowed and\nconsecrated by rehgion and prayer, and it will for ever\nbear their impress ; that influence can never be lost, it\nappeals to your souls and deeply affects you ;\nyou all\nfelt the difference because in the Abbey, in the con-\nsecrated ground, there is an indestructible influence whereas\nin the Castle all is passed, changed, and gone.\" Soon\nafter this, Home awoke. We had shght physical mani-\nfestations, which gave me the impression that owing to\nadverse circumstances, the spirits were unable to do what\nthey intended. Home suddenly said, \" I saw something\nbright move across the floor this minute.\" My father\nsaid he also saw it. Directly after, we all heard sounds,\nas if some metalhc substance was being lifted up and\nthrown down again on the floor under the table, and the\nfollowing message was given :\n\" This is the last tiine that\nwe will rejyrove you about a habit that can do you no\npossible good.'\" Neither my father nor Mr. Home could\nat all understand this ; but the meaning struck me at\nonce, and I said, \" The message is for me, and it refers\nto my taking snuff.\" \" Yes,\" was the reply. I said,\n\" Do you wish me to give it up entirely.\" \" Don't take\n\f232 Experiences in Sjnritualism [seance\ntoo much,\" was rapped out. I said, \" I think they have\nbrought my snuff-box across the room from where I left\nit, and that is what we heard under the table.\" \" Yes,\"\nwas again rapped. I asked if they wished to give me the\nbox, the answer was, \" Yes.\" I said, \" Shall I put my\nhand down for it ?\n\" \" No,\" was answered. Shortly\nafter I saw quite distinctly an arm and hand holding the\nsnuff-box open, rise from under the table, and movirjg to\nthe shelf under the window, tilt the box over slightly,\nand then shake out a quantity of snuff upon some papers\nthat happened to be there ; the arm and hand then with-\ndrew, still retaining the box. The hand was more distinct\nthan the arm, and appeared very white, and slightly\nluminous. I could see the fingers quite plainly, and also\nthe manner in which they grasped the box ; Home also\nsaw the hand, arm, and box, my father could not, owing\nto the position in which he was sitting, but on standing\nup he saw a dark heap lying on the paper. I felt the\nbox touch my knee, and asked if I should put my hand\ndown for it. \" Yes,\" was answered, by tapping my knee\nthree times with it. I put my hand under the table,\nand the box was placed in it by a hand ; I felt the tips\nof the fingers, and the inside part of the thumb quite\ndistinctly ; the skin felt quite natural, but somewhat\nwrinkled, conveying the idea of an aged hand. I said\n\" Are the snuff-box and the message given me by my\ngrandfather ?\n\" The following message was given :\n\" Your\nfather saio it 'passing, so did Dan. It is from your grand-\nfather.\" I asked, \" Grandfather Goold ?\n\" \" Yes, Goold.\"\nMy father then expressed a desire to know what spirit\nhad written out the ornamental alphabet last night. The\nfollowing was given : \"It was directed by the same one\nthat directed the music ; the name was indicated by the\ndecorated letters.\" After a pause, the words \" Take instru-\nment \" were spelled out. Home took the accordion, and\nit was beautifully played with tremolo effects. My father\nsaid something about wishing that it could be played in\nhis hand. Home said he thought they would do so, and\nshortly after his chair was pushed back from the table,\nwhich I supposed was done in order to pass the accordion\n\fNO. 63] With D. D. Home 233\nto my father ; it was not however given to him. We\nnow saw a hand approach the vase nearest me, and take\na flower from it, and presently the flower was placed\nupon the edge of the table, and moved across it in little\njerks, as though it were flipped by a finger ; we could\nsee no hand or anything supporting it. The flower was\ntaken off the table, and the following message was given :\n\" We will give you the leaf you saw leave the table.\"\nDirectly after my father was touched on the Imee, and\nputting his hand down, he felt first the flower and then\nthe fingers touch him ; he then expressed a wish to feel\nthe whole hand. Home said. \" I am sure they will try,\nthey generally are able at first to make only the fingers\napparent to you.\" A spirit assented. He kept liis hand\ndown for some little time, but at length took the leaf,\nnot succeeding in feeling more than the fingers ;\nthis\nhowever occurred two or three times. The small table\nthen moved of itself, close up between my father and\nHome, and Sacha's portrait was taken from it, and placed\nupon OUT table. On two or three different occasions\nduring the evening, we heard curious sounds ; once my\nfather and Home heard, as it were, some one whisthng ;\nI could not perceive it at all. At another time, we all\nheard a sound as of some one tr;ying to articulate near\nthe door ; this also ended in a w^histhng. On another\noccasion, we heard some one trying to make their voice\naudible to us, apparently outside the window. Home\nnow went into a trance ; wlule waiting for him to com-\nmence speaking, my father and I were talking about the\nabsence of tests ; he appeared rather pamoyed, saying,\nthat there had been in fact no real tests of identity given,\nand that everybody was remarking the same thing. I\nmentioned the great difficulty of giving really satisfactory\ntests, and reminded him that one striking effect had been\ngiven ;\n(referring to the imitation of the organ bellows\nand tremolo) and asked why he did not try and question\nthem in some way that would serve as a test, it being as\neasy for him to recollect some past event or conversation,\nas it was for them to recall one, that he also remembered.\nHome began speaking about the extreme difficulty they\n\f234 Experietices in Spiritualism [seance\nliad experienced in making any manifestations. \" The\nstate of the external atmosphere is such,\"' he said, \" as\nto render it all but impossible. We act by using certain\nemanations from you, floAving through your brains ;\nnow,\nthe state of the weather, this east wind, has dried all\nthat up, we have next to nothing to work with. It\naffects you all, more especially Dan, but you can all feel\nit, and complained to-day of being depressed and irritated ;\nunder better circumstances you would have seen the hand\nthat carried Sacha's portrait, and the hand that held the\nflower. You observed also that we could not carry the\nflower over the table steadily, but were obhged to push\nit along the surface.\" He then changed the subject to\nthat of tests ;\nspeaking to my father, he said, \" Do not\nbe impatient, all will come right in time, you shall have\ntests given you, you have aheady had some ; remember\nthat what you might think an excellent test to-day, on\nreflection, you might consider to be worth nothing. Would\nyou have us recall a past conversation ? That might be\ndone by mind-reading, and would not be at all a good\ntest. We are the best judges of what we do ; we work\nfor others as well as for you who are here. We have a\ncertain appointed work, and it must be done ; we have\nnot really been able to do half enough yet in the way of\nphysical manifestations ; circumstances have been so much\nagainst us, that we have failed in nearly all we wished to\neffect. We know all the difficulties and trials that sur-\nround you ; but you do not see the cUfficulties that we\nhave to contend against. Physical manifestations are very\nnecessary ; be patient and some day you may arrive at\nother things. We do not ask you to have faith in us ;\nwe only ask that you will be jiJ^tient and prayerful in\ninvestigating.\" Home had apparently great difficulty in\nspeaking ; he now called me over to him, and bidding\nme sit down, said, \" You understand all about this, we\ncannot impress Dan properly with what we want him to\nsay ; circumstances are so adverse that we have scarcely\nany control over him. Ah, I see the entrance at Adare ;\nyour mother is standing there, she appears to be giving\ndirections about planning the garden and walks.\" My\n\fNO. 63] With D. D. Home 235\nfather said, \" Do you mean the lodge gate ?\n\" \" No, no ;\nI mean the httle gate where the notice is put up, '\nThese\ngrounds are strictly private '\n; she is standing there between\nthe two clumps of shrubs ;\nah, it is all confused, I can-\nnot make it out. Your father intends going to the Abbey\nsome night by himself, he wants to find out about those\nbirds ; he will see a sort of bright luminous cloud ;\nyour\nmother will be there.\" My father said, \" But I never\nhad any intention of going to the Abbey.\" Home\nappeared much astonished ;\n\" Are you sure ?\n\" he said.\n\"Yes,\" said my father, \"quite sure.\" \"Well,\" said\nHome, \" that is very strange, the idea must have been\nin your mind, and you have forgotten it, for some of us\nhad arranged what to do the night that you went ;\none\nspirit was going to make the same whisthng sound hke\na bird, and you were to see the luminous cloud.\" I\nasked, \" Were they then not real birds that we\nheard whisthng?\" \"No, they were not birds.\" Home\nthen threw himself back, and taking my hand, said, \" We\ncannot influence Dan properly, your father had better ask\nquestions.\" My father said, \" I thought Elhotson was\ngoing to have made some experiments.\" \" Yes, he was\nanxious to, and tried, but he could not succeed ;\nhe\nattempted to make his voice heard by the door, and\ninstead of being hke a voice, it sounded to you hke a\nwhistle ; the conditions are very bad, we have been able\nto do scarcely anything to-night, besides your minds are\nnot favourable\u2014they are disturbed, and out of harmony.\"\nMy father dechned to put any questions, so I asked about\na certain disputed answer of Dr. ElUotson's that had been\ngiven us in the gallery at Adare. Home said, \" Your\nfather was right : he did say '\nYes '\n;\nafterwards he said\nhe would come by the sea ;\nyou were mistaken.\" After\na pause, he said \" Your grandfather is really anxious\nabout your taking so much snuff ; he did not hke to put\nit any stronger than he did in saying that it could do you\nno possible good ; but he is anxious about it, because he\nthinks it will harm your nervous system. He says, if\nyou Hke to take an occasional pinch, that will not hurt\nyou ; but he does not like to see you take as much as\n\f236 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nyou do at present. (Turning to my lather) Dr. Elliotson\nis here and has brought a girl with him : her name is\nDawson, she is short and appears so stooping as to be\nahnost deformed ; I cannot make out lier Christian name.\nHarriet,\u2014Harriet ;\nno, that is not it : she will not tell\nme\u2014how very odd !\n\" My father said : \"I have a very\nvague recollection of a mesmeric patient of the name of\nDawson ; but I don't think her name was Harriet.\" ^\nHome now said, \" Dan must awake, Adare, go back to\nyour place.\" Home being exhausted, we went at once\ninto the dining room to supper. During the whole time\nthat I was sitting by Home, I could see the shadowy\nform of a figure appearing white and shghtly luminous,\nstanding close to my father. He perceived nothing. In\nmoving to my place, I could not avoid passing right\nthrough the figure, but as I approached it, it disappeared.\nSoon after we had gone into the dining room, my father\nbeing at the table, and Home sitting on the floor, near\nthe fireplace, with his hand resting against the wall, he\nsuddenly said : \" Adare, I hear raps for the alphabet \"\n;\nand the following was given :\n\" Elleji Daw \" \" Oh,\nDawson,\" my father said. \" Yes,\" was rajjped out. Home\nsaid, \" Ellen Dawson, Ellen Dawson ; Who on earth is\nshe ? I never heard of such a person.\" \" Oh,\" my\nfather replied, \"It is the Christian name of a mesmeric\npatient which you could not make out in your trance.\"\nNow this is a curious fact. The name Ellen having been\nin my father's mind for a moment, had Home mentioned\nit in his trance, it might have been attributed to ordinary\nclairvoyance or mind-reading on his part ; but coming as\nit did through raps, it could not be accounted for in that\nway. My father had said to me in the course of the\nevening, \" I have not the same confidence in what is said\nin a trance ; it may be accounted for by mind-reading or\nclairvoyance ; but if a name or a message be given\nthrough raps, even if it be read from my mind, it must\nbe attributed to some intelligence other than that of the\n^ My fatlier says that he had a notion Ellen was the name ; however,\nhe did not mention this aloud.\n\fKO. 63] With D. D. Home 237\nmedium, or any one in the room.^ Directly after the\nseance, I poured the snuff back into my box, from the\npaper on the ledge under the window where we had seen\nit deposited. After supper, my father said, \" Let us go\nand see if the snuff is there.\" I said that I had already\nremoved it ; but we went and found remnants of snuff\nstill on and among the papers, quite sufficient to prove\nthat it had been there.\u2014A.\n[The following occurrences were witnessed and recorded by\nme after Mr. Home's return to London.]\nNo. 64.\n\u2014\nSeance, Ashletj House, March 29th, 1869.\nPresent : \u2014Mr. Rudall, IVIr. McKenzie, Mr. Jencken,\nHome, and myself. After a short time we experienced\nsMght physical manifestations, raps, vibrations, &c., &c.\nThe table was raised about one foot off the ground ; it\nwas raised a second time about two feet, and after\nremaining stationary in the air for some seconds, it rose\nto the height of at least five feet, rolhng and swaying\nwith a movement like that of a ship at sea ; it descended\nslowly with a strong vibratory motion, accompanied by a\nsound resembhng that of a railway train. I asked if\nthese pecuhar movements had any definite meaning ; the\nanswer was \" Yes.\" By asking several questions\nwhich were answered \" Yes \" or \" No,\" it appeared that\nthe movements had reference to me, and that I ought to\nunderstand the meaning. Flowers and fern leaves were\nbrought from the chimney piece and given to us. We\nnow, at Mr. RudaU's suggestion, shut the folding doors,\nthereby excluding all fight save that entering by the\nwindow. Home went into a trance. He clapped his\nhands (the sign adopted by Adah Menken to signify her\npresence), and going to the window, folded the curtains\n^ On reference to the Zoist, Ellen Dawson appears as a patient of\nMr. Hind's, and a clairvoyant. My father recollects her at Dr. Elliot\n-\nson's. She is mentioned in seance No. 14, p. 90, in connection with\nMrs. Hennings and Dr. Elliotson.\n\f238 Experie7ices in Spiritualism [seance\nround him, leaving only his head clear. We all saw a\nvery curious appearance form itself above his head ; it\nlooked at first like a lace handkerchief, held out by a\nstick or support of some sort ; soon however it became\nmore distinct and appeared to be a shadowy human form\nenveloped in drapery ; it was about two feet in length.\nSome one present remarked that it exceedingly resembled\na \" vignette \" heading one of Adah Menken's poems.\nHome said (speaking as Menken) \" Yes, that is it, that is\nwhat I wish to imitate ; I will try and make my form\nvisible to you.\" The surface of the waU to Home's right\nbecame illuminated three or four times ; the light appar-\nently radiating from a bright spot in the centre. Across\nthe portion of wall thus illuminated we repeatedly saw a\ndark shadow pass ; it appeared to me to be rather the\nshadow cast by a sohd substance than the actual form\nitself. Home's collar stud dropped on the floor, and a\nspirit brought it and placed it on my head, touching my\nbrow while doing so ; Home remarked that it was shining\nlike a little star upon my forehead, he told me to take\ncare of it until Dan should awake. After Home awoke\nwe had some more physical manifestations, flowers were\nagain brought to us, we were all touched, Mr. Rudall\nreceived several messages, apparently from his father, the\nclock was made to strike in answer to some question, we\nheard a heavy step in the passage and the folding doors\nwere opened and shut, a sofa was moved from the wall\nto our table, and a chair was carried across the room.\nNo. 65.\n\u2014\nSeance, Ashley House, April 3rd [1869].\nPresent : \u2014Mrs. Gregory, Miss Douglas, Mr. Charles\nBlackburn, Mr. Fuller, the Master of Lindsay, Home, and\nmyself. We had tolerably strong physical manifestations,\nlasting for a short time, after which Home went into a\ntrance. He walked about and was elongated in the\nusual manner. He then stood still before us, and stretch-\ning out his arms to their full length, a palpable elongation\ntook place in them. I said, \" Can you manage that we\n\fNO. 65] With D. D. Home 239\nmay test that in some way ;\nmay I stand just in front\nof you, or will you place yourself against the wall ?\n\"\nHome replied, \" Yes, certainly, we will do both.\" I\naccordingly placed myself just in front of him, with my\narms extended along and touching his ; his arms were\nelongated four or five inches, the others could judge of\nthe extent pretty well by comparison with mine. While\nhis arms appeared to be increasing in length, his chest\nbecame greatly expanded, and he said to me, \" You see\nhow it is, the extension is from the chest.\" He then\nplaced himself against the wall, and extended his arms to\ntheir full natural length ; I made a pencil mark at the\ntips of his fingers. His left arm was then elongated, I\nheld the pencil against the wall, suffering it to be pushed\nalong by his fingers, until he told me to make another\nmark. His right arm was then elongated, and I marked\nthe movement in the same manner. The total elongation\nas ascertained by this means, amounted to 9J inches.\nHome now stood by Miss Douglas, and talked to her for\na considerable time, mentioning the spirits who were\nabout her, recalhng past circumstances of her life, and\nimpressing upon her, that it was in her power to be of\nvery great service to the cause of Spiritualism ; he spoke\nalso a good deal to Mrs. Gregory. Walking over to the\nfire-place, he took from thence, with his hand, a red-hot\nglowing ember, about the size of a small orange. Mrs.\nGregory became nervous, fearing that he would request\nher to take it, he however went to Miss Douglas and\nsaid, \" Now if you have sufificient faith, let me place this\ncoal in your hand \" ; she replied, \" I have faith, but I\ncannot overcome the physical dread, pray do not ask me\nto take it.\" Upon this, Home said, \" If you would only\nallow me to place it in your hand it would not burn\nyou ; it does not burn Dan ; it would not harm him \"\n(pointing to Lindsay). He then placed the coal which\nhad by this time become black, on Lindsay's head, but\nalmost immediately took it off, and saying, \" That is not\n\u2022of much use as an experiment, for the natural heat has\nalmost left the coal,\" he crumbled it in his hand and then\nthrew it in the fireplace. Presently he took another red-\n\f240 Experie7ices in Spiritualism [seance\nhot ember from the fire, and holding it in his hand, spoke\na few words to Miss Douglas on the subject of faith.\nShe held out her hand, and he placed the coal in it.\nMiss Douglas was not in the least burned, and said that\nit felt rather cold, like marble. After allowing it to\nremain there a few seconds, Home took the coal and\nrequested Miss Douglas to touch it ; she placed her fingers\nnear it, but withdrew them immediately, saying that it\nburned her.^ He then placed it in Mr. Blackburn's\nhand, previously asking if he had any faith, who replied\nthat he had. After he had held it for a short time he\nsaid it became hotter. Home then took the ember,\nthrew it away, smiled, and seemed pleased at the success\nof the experiment. He now sat down and turning to\nLindsay, said, \" Ah, what a pity it was that those httle\nseances that you held here in the winter were broken up\n(referring to two or three occasions on which Lindsay,\nCaptain Smith, Home, and I had sat together). We\ntold you that we wished to speak on some very interest-\ning subjects, and we would have done so ; we were\nanxious also to have entered upon the subject of the\norigin of certain of the ceremonies of your Church. We\nhave such difficulties to contend with ; we had got the\nconditions so very favourable at that time, the party was\nharmonious and we could have done so much ; but then,\nyou see, when we had arranged everything on the spiritual\nside, it is all broken up on the material,\u2014on your side.\"\nTurning to one of those present, he said, \" That arrange-\nment of seven with which we impressed Fred (Fuller).\nOh ! if that could have been managed it would have been\nof such use. We could and would have conducted a\nseries of experiments so wonderful, so clearly proved, and\nso easy to record, that it would have been impossible to\ndoubt them.\" (This had reference to an impression that\nseven were to form themselves into a society for the\nstudy of occult science.) In reply to Fuller, he said,\n1 I am informed by Miss Douglas and the Master of Lindsay that\nLord Adare has omitted to state that Mr. Home put this coal between\nhis coat and shirt under the arm, and that no mark of singeing or\nburning was visible on the shirt. \u2014D.\n\fNO. 65] With D. D, Home 241\n\" We still have hopes about that arrangement ; we think\nthere may possibly be a future for it.\" Home now spoke\nin a totally different tone of voice, addressing us in the\nsame style and dehvery as in the portions of seances\nrecorded in pages 158, 159, and 167. He said something to\nthis effect :\n\" You think that baptism is a thing of to-day,\na ceremony instituted but 1,800 years ago ! Come with\nme away to the banks of the distant Ganges, travel with\nme far back in the annals of time, and I will shew you.\nraces of men dwelling there who worshipped senseless\ngods of wood and stone\u2014and yet not much more sense-\nless than the god that some among you worship now\n\u2014\nand who had the same ceremony of baptism, which was\nobhgatory for them before an infant could be admitted\nto the benefits of their church and rehgion. Will you\ntravel still further back with me into ages long anterior\nto this, and see the altars dripping with blood\u2014aye, with\nhuman blood\u2014and the priest decked with flowers standing\nin his place, and the people bowing down, and the sacri-\nfices offered. Blood I see on every page\u2014-blood ! blood !\nblood ! True it is, that in later years it was that of\nbulls and of goats, of doves and pigeons. And what is\nyour religion now to many of you but blood ; still the\nsame\u2014blood to appease a God ! Ah, it is fearful\u2014it is\ntoo horrible, blood and sacrifice to propitiate your God,\nyour Maker, your Father, the infinitely perfect and loving\nCreator of all things.\" Home spoke at great length on\nthese subjects ; but I cannot recall to mind the exact\nlanguage he made use of. After he awoke we had some\ncurious manifestations. A small camp chair was raised\noff the floor and carried round the table, touching each\nof us in turn, and finally was placed on the centre of the\ntable, where it remained. The sofa was moved up to us.\nWe received no messages during the seance.\nNo. 66.\n\u2014\nAshley House.\nOn the 4th or 5th of the month [April, 1869], in the\nevening, I was seated at the table in Home's room at\nQ\n\f242 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nAshley House writing ; he was seated at the opposite\nside, reading ; we heard raps upon the door ; Home\nsaid \" Your grandfather has come in, do you not see\nhim sitting in that chair yonder ?\n\" \"I see no one,\"\nI answered ;\n\" Which grandfather do you mean ?\n\" \" Your\nfather's father; you will at any rate hear him.\" I\nheard a sovmd as if some one sitting on the chair he\nhad mentioned had put his foot on the ground. Home,\nwhile speaking, went into a trance. The chair moved\nvery slowly up to the table (no one touching it) a distance\nof eight feet eleven inches. \" He is moving the chair,\"\nHome said. \" He is pleased to be able to do that, he\nsays you never saw a much prettier manifestation than\nthat ; Ah ! he has gone over there now.\" Another chair\nmoved close up to me, a distance of about a foot. Home\nsaid \" He is sitting in that chair near you ; he has\ncome because he wishes to speak to you ;\nyou are rather\nin difficulties he thinks.\" He then spoke to me about\ncertain private matters. Presently Home said :\n\" Your\nmother does not wish you to think that she forgot you\nbecause she said so little about your marriage ; she could\nnot say more then, and after all, what could she do\nmore than pray God's blessing upon you in this as she\nwould in everything that you undertake, honestly, and\nwith a desire to do that which is right. She has much\nmore to say on the subject, but not now.\"\nNo. 67.\n\u2014\nAshley House.\nOn the night of the 6th [April, 1869] I got home\nabout eleven o'clock. I found Home aheady in bed.\nHe told me that he was very unwell ; that he had\nleft the house on his way to Gower Street ; that he\nhad suddenly lost consciousness on turning out of Ashley\nPlace, and that he remembered nothing more until he\nfound himself in bed. Home soon went to sleep and\nbegan to talk and mutter ; after what he had said I\nattributed it to bodily illness, and did not pay much\nattention, however I soon found that he was in a trance.\n\fNO. 67] With D. D. Home 243\nThe first distinct words he uttered were \" But I am\nnot an Hindoo.\" The room shook for some minutes\nvery violently as if people were dancing on the floor\nbelow. Home said, \" Oh, do stop that dancing, they\nmust not do it, it is not kind.\" The shaking of the\nfloor almost immediately ceased ; I asked if people had\nbeen dancing below, but received no answer. Home\nturned to me and speaking in a firm loud voice, said,\n\" Ah, dear me, the poor Httle dog has gone !\n\" \" What\ndog ?\n\" I asked. \" Why, little white- sister ^\n\u2014she has\ngone just now. Are you not sorry, Adare 1 They will\nbe so grieved about it. She has passed from earth ;\nbut she is not destroyed, she is like a httle spark of\nelectricity, now a small globe of fight, it is moving on,\nin time it will come m contact with some other substance\nand be absorbed.\" \" Absorbed into what ?\n\" I asked.\n\" Oh, into some higher form of animal hfe. Some spirits\ncould catch it, for although I said it was fike a little\nglobe of light, still you know on leaving the body it had\nthe appearance of the fittle dog, and some spirits might\ncapture it and keep it for a time, but eventually it would\nbe absorbed, for that is the law of nature, and they could\nnot overrule it. It has no sensation or consciousness\nnow ; its condition of being, its organization, was not\nsufliciently high to permit of its retaining its individuafity.\"\n\" But,\" I said, \" are there not animals in the other\nworld ?\n\" \" Oh dear yes, God in his goodness has made\nvariety in the spirit world, as he has in your world\n;\nthere would be no beauty without variety ; there are\ndogs and horses and many animals. The Red Indians\nwere not wrong in their ideas of the '\nhappy hunting\nground,' their Seers saw these things in visions, and they\nreally exist.\" \" But,\" I observed, \" although they might\nhunt they could never kill the animals.\" \" Oh no, of\ncourse they could not shed their blood, but they could\nconquer them ; it is difficult for you to understand, but\n' A little dog belonging to Mrs. S. C. Hall. Home, I believe, knew\nthat the dog was ill ; but could not have heard of its death, which took\nplace between 10 and 11 o'clock. I had no idea that the dog was\neven ill.\n\f244 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nyou know yourself that the real charm of all hunting\nconsists rather in shoAving your superiority over the\nanimal, in overcoming it, than in the mere shedding of\nblood and killing.\" \" But,\" I asked, \" if some animals\nretain their individuality, and continue to exist in the\nnext world under the same form that they had here, and\nothers are as you say absorbed, where is the line drawn 1\nWhat is it that causes one to be absorbed, while another\nretains its individuahty ?\n\" \" Oh, I do not say that the\nanimals in the next world ever existed on earth, it does\nnot seem to me that they did, I only know that they are\nthere, and I see that the life of animals upon earth is\neventually absorbed into other forms. I do not know that\nyour animals ever continue to exist in the spirit-world.\"\n\" You heard those Hindoos dancing just now ?\n\"\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"I heard what I thought were people\ndancing on the floor below us.\" \" Oh, it was not caused\nby mortals, there is no one living on that floor now ;\nthey were spirits\u2014Hindoos.\" \" What on earth do they\nwant here,\" I asked. \" Well, they are very anxious about\ntheir Trinity.\" \" But why should that bring them here ?\n\"\n\" They do not seem to have any special object in being\nhere, but they are occupied with that subject, and that\nis why they are on earth ;\nthey are very advanced\nHindoos, and they want to prove that their Trinity is\nnot different from your Trinity as you suppose ; there is\na good deal going on now in the world in the way of\ninvestigating these subjects. These Hindoos are anxious\nabout this ;\nthey say there is not so much difference as\nyou think ; for instance, they assert that their second\nperson Christna was incarnated as your second person\nChrist was.\" Question :\n\" Had they a personal devil ?\n\"\n\" Yes ; and they say that Christna was tempted of the\ndevil in the same way as Christ.\" The substance of\nHome's conversation after this I forget ; it led somehow\nto his saying, \" When this zone shall have become torrid,\nof course the forms of animals and vegetable life will\nbe much changed.\" Question :\n\" Do you mean that the\ntemperature is changing ?\n\" \" Oh, yes, these will be the\ntorrid zones, and the torrid zones will become cooler\n;\n\fNO. 67] With D. D. Home 245\nthere is a very marked change taking pkice now.\"\nQuestion : \"I suppose the change will be so gradual, that\nlife will not be affected ?\n\" \" Life will not be affected,\nthe change is gradual, but it is quite apparent to us.\"\nQuestion :\n\" Has the heat of the two last seasons any-\nthing to do with this, or was it quite abnormal ?\n\"\n\" No, it was not entirely abnormal, it had to do with\nthe great change that is taking place.\" Question :\n\" Then will the frigid zones round the poles become\nwarmer 1\n\" \" Oh yes, certainly ; do you know it is true\nthat there is land to the North beyond where explorers\nhave yet penetrated, and there are tribes of men hving\nthere, and they yet retain the traces of a by-gone civiliza-\ntion. They are of the old Semitic or original Hebrew\nrace.\" Question :\n\" But how could they ever get there ;\nit could not have been in historic times ?\n\" In answer\nto this question, I distinctly heard a voice quite different\nto Home's say, \" Oh dear, no.'' Home said, \" Did you\nhear him !\n\" \" Yes,\" I answered, \" I heard him quite\nplain.\" \" I am glad you did ; he said '\nOh dear, no.'\nHe is rather difficult to understand, this spirit ; he seems\na little confused, but he declares he has seen these people,\nand that he could bring the spirit of one of them with\nhim. He says there are distinct traces of Hebrew to be\nfound in their language. You know there are traces of\nthe old original Hebrew in the language of the Brahmins.\nThe ancient Hebraic tribes were a most migratory people,\nalways wandering and fighting ; their idea even of God\nwas a warlike, bloodthirsty being, and they were always\nfighting and quarrelling among themselves and their neigh-\nbours, and doing so in the name of the Lord. They\nhave wandered all over the earth, and have left their\nmarks in many places. There are signs of a civilization\nthat you know nothing of, in North America ; it was\nderived from the same source. Historians have con-\njectured that they crossed the narrow channel of a few\nmiles in breadth ; and they are correct.

If population increases as it\ndoes at present, the time must come when there will be\nno outlet for emigrants ; and surely it cannot be natural\nor right that people should be carried off by plagues and\nfamines,\" \" Epidemics and famines are quite in the\n\fNO. 67] With D.

Cannot\nyou understand that men, by cultivating the intellectual\nquahties, the higher organs contained in the upper portion\nof the brain will arrive at such a condition, that their\nsole gratification and pleasure will be in the pursuit of all\nthat is beautiful, harmonious, and good ? \u2014the upper por-\ntions of the brain will become more fully developed, the\nlower parts being neglected will become less and less, the\nanimal nature weaker, and man will no longer find the\nsame pleasure in the gratification of his lusts and\npassions ; man will become spirituahsed, and will be very\ndifferent to what he is now.\" Soon after this. Home\nawoke. He spoke for such a length of time, that a great\ndeal of what he said has entirely escaped my memory.\nAllan Kardec died on Sunday the 4th. On the Wednes-\nday or Thursday following, as Home and I were in the\ndressing room, at about 11 o'clock in the morning, we\nheard loud raps on the floor between us. The alphabet\nwas asked for and the following message given :\n\" Bon\njour, mon ami Daniel, je crois que je me suis trompe un peu\nla has en fait d'identite. Allan Kardec.'''' Home asked a\nfew questions which were answered by raps.\nNo. 68.\u2014Ashley House, April lOth [18G9].\nLast night JVIr. J\n\u2014\n\u2014 and I walked to Ashley House\nwith Home from Fitzroy Square. Home complained of\nfeehng nervous, as is usually the case after an unsuc-\ncessful seance. He sat down at the piano, and com-\nmenced playing ; while so engaged he went into a trance.\n\f248 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nI extinguished one of the candles, and placed the other\non the floor. We heard sounds as of some one walking\nup and down the passage, and raps upon the door and\nwalls. Mr. J felt, during the whole evening, a strong\ncurrent of very cold air blowing about him. Home\nwalked about the room apparently in great distress ; he\nmoaned and sat down on the floor and seemed to mourn\nover something. Suddenly the character of the influence\nchanged. Home came over to where I was sitting on the\nsofa, and made me lie at full length upon it ;\nby the\nattitude he assumed I recognized the spirit he calls \" the\nnameless doctor.\" He stood beside me apparently lost\nin thought for a minute or two, then kneeling down,\nmade me unbutton my waistcoat, began sounding my\nchest as doctors do ; he then rubbed and patted over\nthe chest, loins, and legs, occasionally turning round as if\nto ask advice from some one ; his efforts were principally\ndirected to my right side, he frequently pointed to it and\nturned his head as if to call some one's attention to that\nparticular spot. He placed his mouth to my right side\nand exhaled a deep breath ; the heat I felt was something\nextraordinary. When he had finished. Home seemed\npleased with what he had done, smiled and rubbed his\nhands as if delighted. The first influence now seemed to\nreturn ; he sat down on the floor evidently in great dis-\ntress ; then lay flat on his back and extended his arms\nin the form of a cross. His body became rigid and he\nwas palpably elongated, and was almost raised off the\nground ; he may have been completely off, but I think\nnot ; it was evident, however, by the swaying vibratory\nmotion of his body that it was not resting naturally on\nthe ground. While this was taking place two chairs\nmoved slightly of themselves. Home got up, knelt upon\none knee, and simulated a man endeavouring to raise a\nheavy body. He appeared to fail once or twice ; at last\nhe raised it, and supporting it on his knee, carried it\nwith great difficulty to a chair near at hand, where he\nplaced it and sat down on the floor, apparently much\nexhausted. He beckoned to me, and when I approached\ntold me in French to bring a chair, and sit near him ;\n\fNO. 68] With D. D. Home 249\nI did so, and lie spoke in French somewhat to the follow-\ning effect. \" What we have been trying to represent to\nyou by acting, is the condition of Allan Kardec. The\nbody that was extended on the ground in the form of a\ncross, and that was elongated, was his ; he suffered a\ngood deal for truth ; and in symbolism as you know,\nthe cross signifies truth ; but then he was not enlightened ;\nhe refused the light, he was obstinate, and would not\nenlighten himself upon it, and that makes him unhappy\nnow ; it seems to weigh upon him, he cannot raise him-\nself above his former ideas and prejudices. We tried to\nrepresent that by the difficulty of raising the heavy body.\nHe is sitting here in this chair ; he does not move ; he\nwould not come into the room at first, you heard him\nwalking in the passage. There are many spirits here of\nhis '\nentourage.' Of his followers, and he had many of\nthem, some of the spirits will not come into the room,\nI know not why ;\nyou hear them in the passage ; there\nare two just behind here that I do not like at all.\"'\nPresently Home gave a cry almost amounting to a scream,\nand shuddering pointed to the opposite side of the room\nand said in English, \" Who are those fearful looking men ?\nOh, what are they doing ? They are eastern, their feet\nare bare, as also their legs up to the knees, they will not\nshow their faces, they cover them with a sort of cloak\n;\noh this is horrible, they are hiding and lying in wait for\nsomething. They are so totally undeveloped, so earthy\nand material, they could shed blood, they could take\nman's life.\" \" Do you mean,\" I said, \" to tell me that\nthese spirits could kill a man 1\n\" \" Oh yes,\" he answered,\n\" they could, but they can do no harm here at all ; it\nwas in a city where the sun cast broad alternate bands\nof light and shadow ; I can see them among the ohve\ntrees gUding in and out ;\nthey are so fearfully undeveloped,\nso material ;\nthey could harm a man if he had not power\nover them ; that must come by prayer.\" I asked Mr.\nJ if he had any idea what all this meant. He\nrephed, \" Yes, I think I know.\" Home got up, took a\nstriped rug off the sofa, and covering his shoulders, head,\nand face with it, began walking about the room in a\n\f250 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nstealthy manner, hiding behind the furniture, and crawl-\ning about flat upon the ground, apparently lying in wait\nfor some one. Suddenly he put his hand upon the\ncandle, and left us in almost total darkness. I could\njust distinguish him gliding about the room, and crawUng\non the floor. At one time he stood up and was elongated\n;\nhe came close to me and said, \" What did they do to\nhis brother ?\n\" \" Whose brother ?\n\" said Mr. J .\n\" Why, yours.\" \" Oh, good gracious,\" cried Mr. J ;\n\" How strange \" ; and so saying he sank back into his\nchair. Home added, \" He is not dead ; he is quite safe.\"\nI spoke two or three times to Mr. J after this, but\nreceived no answer. Home said, \" He is under influence.\"\nPresently, Home sat down on the floor beside me and\nsaid, \"He is under influence; the tall strong man who\nis influencing him will move something.\" A chair behind\nme moved of itself. Home leaned his head against my\nknee ; it appeared most extraordinarily heavy. I placed\nmy hand upon it, and the weight was removed. \" Did\nyou feel,\" he said, \" the weight on Dan's head ? That\nwas the influence of only one of those men ;\nthey are so\nstrong, so very material.\" Mr. J became much\naffected ; he sobbed violently, seemed in great distress,\nspoke in Arabic with great rapidity, and said, \" Oh,\nS S \" (his brother's name), and then \" Chahni\n!\nchalini !\n\" which means \" Leave me ! leave me !\n\" I began\nasking Home about what had puzzled me very much,\nnamely, his having asserted that spirits could do bodily\nharm to man. He said, \" Yes, they can ; I will tell you\nlater. Dan must awake to take the influence off J .\"\nHome suddenly awoke, and asked what was going on.\nI told him that Mr. J was under influence, upon\nwhich he took his hands, and he immediately awoke, and\nwas much astonished at finding that he had been crying\nviolently.\nI slept in Home's room ; after we had gone to bed he\nwent into a trance and said \" Of course not ;\nwhy of\ncourse they could not, Adare.\" \" Could not do what ?\n\"\nI asked. \" Why, could not do harm here.\" \" You are\nreferring to those spirits,\" I said. \" I never thought\n\fNO. 68] With D. D. Home 251\nthey could do harm here ; but could they hurt a man\nunder any circumstances ? \" \" Yes, they could ;\nyou see\nhis brother had been mixed up in some magical incanta-\ntions, where sacrifices were offered. Now, if a man sold\nhimself to such spirits as those, if he gave himself to them\nfor any purpose, they could do as they hked with him.\"\n\" But,\" I asked, \" could they take his life ? Could they\nfor instance strike him with a knife ?\n\" \" Certainly, why\nnot ? you have seen tables, chairs and heavy objects moved\nby a spirit, why not a knife also.\" \" But that would\nnot be fair play, he could not strike them back,\" I said.\n\" No, he could not ; but they could not touch him unless\nhe was wilUng. You see it would be necessary that he\nshould have allowed them to gain power over him, if for\nany purpose he did that, they could then so use their\ninfluence as to make him do whatever they chose. They\ndid not hurt his brother, they carried him off, it was as\nif he had fallen among bandits.^ There is more truth\nthan you suppose in the stories of the old magicians, and\nthe precautions they adopted to protect themselves from\nthe undeveloped and material influences with which they\nsurrounded themselves. Your mother stood just behind\nyou when Dan's head became so heavy against your\nknee ; she influenced you to put your hand on his head,\nshe was anxious a little about Dan, a httle fearful that\nhe might be hurt. Of course you know no harm could\ncome to him.\" Home now awoke, he had a distinct\nimpression of the sort of influence that had been about\nhim, and said \" I feel very strange, so dreadfully crafty\nand sly, if I were to give way to my feelings I should\ndo all sorts of curious things, I should hide behind the\ncurtains, and go to Mr. J 's room and try to frighten\nhim.\" I told Home a little of what had occurred so as\nto account for these strange feehngs.\n^ I am not certain whether this sentence conveys Home's meanLns;\nquite correctly.\n\f252 Experie^ices in Spiritualism [seance\nNo. (id.\n[The following account of what occurred to Mr. J\nduring the night, was related to me by him two or\nthree days afterwards. He said] :\n\u2014\n\" I went to bed in the spare room, but did not immedi-\nately put out the candle. I was lying with my face\nturned towards the wall, when suddenly the bed-clothes\nwere pulled so violently as nearly to uncover me. I\njumped up in bed, and the movement ceased. After\nwatching a few minutes I lay down and the clothes were\nagain sharply pulled. This was repeated three times ;\nI could not detect anything touching the clothes, in fact\nthe moment I sat up to watch all movement ceased.\nWhile this was going on I heard distinct raps all about\nthe room. I now turned round and saw a number of\nfigures near the window, moving about, apparently con-\nversing ;\nthey were of a grey or whitish colour, the\nfeatures in profile were very distinct, and the hands\nespecially so ; but I could not see how they rested on\nthe floor, as the lower extremities finished in vapour or\ncloud. I used every means in my power to induce them\nto look at me and answer my questions, by raps or other-\nwise, but in vain. I begged them to speak, and exercised\nmy will as forcibly as I could to make them do so, but\nthey would not take the shghtest notice of me ; I accord-\ningly got out of bed and slowly approached them. When\nI was within about three paces of them they divided in\ntwo rows on each side of the window, as if to allow me\nto pass, and turning round, bent their heads and looked\ndown towards me ; at the next step they all separated,\nand I experienced a feeling of intense cold ; when close\nupon them they disappeared. I walked slowly back-\nwards, and when I had retreated three or four yards,\nthe forms became visible. I went to bed but never\nclosed my eyes ; the figures remained near the window\nmoving about as if in conversation, until a quarter to\nseven when they disappeared. After going towards them\nthe first time, in order to make sure that I was thoroughly\n\fKO. 69] With D. D. Home 253\nawake, I went to a cupboard, opened it, and found a box\nof brown biscuits of which I ate two ; I also found a\nHighland sporran, and read the monogram on the hilts\nof the knives. After dressing in the morning, I examined\nthe cupboard, found the box of biscuits, and ascertained\nthat I had read the monograms correctly ; I also walked\nall over the house during the night in search of Home's\nroom, but could not find it. I spoke to the figures\nrepeatedly in Enghsh, not in Arabic.\"\nNo. 70.\n[The following strange story was also related to me on\nthe same occasion by Mr. J . As it evidently bears\nupon the occurrences related in p. 249, I have deter-\nmined to break through the rule hitherto adhered to of\nrelating only what took place in my own presence.\nI had the story direct from Mr. J , who received it\nfrom his brother. Mr. J at my request wrote to\nhis brother in the East, to enquire if anything had\nhappened to him on the Friday when the strange occur-\nrences mentioned in pp. 249, 250, took place, but no\nanswer has as yet been received.]\n\" About three years ago, my brother S. was residing in\nmy father's house, in the town of , in the East,\nstudying '\nNahawi,' that is the grammatical Arabic, the\nlanguage of the '\nKoran '\n\u2014quite a different tongue from\nthe vernacular. One day he was much astonished at\nreceiving an answer in '\nNahawi ' from a poor labouring\nman, to whom he had addressed some question ; he\nentered into conversation, and found that this man was\nwell educated, and he also noticed that in the evening he\nwas dressed in a style quite incompatible with his rank\nof life ; in fact he appeared much superior to the class\nto which he belonged. One day, soon after their first\nmeeting, this labourer, whom I will call '\nthe native '\nas\nI cannot mention his name, told my brother that lie had\n\f254 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nsomething of importance to communicate if he would\npromise secrecy. He then informed him that in a field\noutside the town, belonging to his father, there was some-\nthing buried that he was determined to obtain by means\nof what in the East is called '\nmagic '\n; he said that he\nhad already tried but had failed, that he was determined\nto succeed even at the risk of his life, but that it was\nnecessary for him to obtain the co-operation of some\nmember of the family ; if my brother would assist him,\nhe promised to give up anything of value that might be\nfound, bargaining only to be allowed to keep a certain\nscroll or parchment. My brother agreed, and on the\nfollowing Friday they commenced operations. I may men-\ntion here that in Mahomedan countries it is supposed that\nFriday is the only day on which magic can be successfully\npractised. S. and the native left the town just before\nthe gates were shut, at sunset, and proceeded to the field\nin question ;\narrived there they sat down cross-legged on\nthe ground, at right angles to each other, and about four\nor five yards apart, the native warning S. not to mind\nhim, and on no account to scream, as that would involve\nconsiderable danger to both. The native commenced\nburning incense and repeating invocations or prayers,\nbowing his head to the ground ;\nvery soon loud thrusts\nor blows were heard on the ground and several forms\nbecame visible, issuing apparently out of the earth. These\nfigures commenced walking round the two men. On\npassing S. each figure stooped down and threw a handful\nof dust into his face ; his clothes were covered with dust\nafterwards. On passing the native, each figure struck\nhim on the head ;\nhe, however, took no notice whatever\nof them, merely bowing his head down, adding fresh\nincense, and mumbhng something to himself. After a\ntime the figures disappeared into the ground, and the\nnative said that all was over for that night.\n\" On the second Friday the same ceremonies were gone\nthrough, except that the incense was of a different kind,\nwith hke results ; the forms appeared, but suddenly a\ntremendous shower of dry bones fell over them. S. could\nnot tell where they came from, but they appeared to come\n\fNO. 70] With D. D. Home 255\nfrom behind him so as to be directed against the native.\nThe native jumped up and said that something had\noccurred to interrupt the arrangements, and that they\nmust immediately go.\n\" On the third Friday the usual invocations and incense\nburning were gone through, and the figures appeared and\ncommenced walking round, and throwing dust as on the\nfirst occasion. Suddenly the figure of a- gigantic black\nman appeared out of the ground, armed with a great\nstick or club, with which he belaboured the native in the\nmost fearful manner ; while a great commotion took\nplace among the other figures\u2014instead of moving slowly\nround, they were all rushing about as if in a state of\ngreat agitation. The native took no notice at first of\nthe black man, merely crouching himself closer to the\nground, increasing the ardour of his incantations, and\nadding fresh incense. At length, however, he said in\nArabic, '\nWell, well, be it so ; if you must have it, you\nshall.' After this, all was quiet.\n\" On the following Friday they again went out ; but\nthis time the native carried with him a five lamb con-\ncealed under his burnous which, after they were seated\non the ground, he proceeded to kill and skin. They went\nthrough the usual incense burning, &c., &c. ; and first the\nfigures appeared, and then the black man rose from out\nof the ground, and advanced in a menacing attitude\ntowards the native, preparing to strike him with his club.\nThe native held up the lamb to him, and the figure took it\nand disappeared again into the earth. S. declares that the\nearth hterally opened, and that the black figure descended,\nbearing the lamb through the aperture. In a few minutes\nthe black figure reappeared, and a conversation ensued\nbetween him and the native ; the latter seemed very\nangry, declared that he had compHed with all their\nrequests, that the black man was not the spirit that he\nwanted at all, and that he had been duped. The alterca-\ntion was suddenly interrupted by a shower of dry bones\nupon which the figure disappeared ; and the native jumped\nup, seized S.'s arm and hurried him away, saying that\nthey were watched.\n\f256 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\n\" It appears that my father noticed that S. absented\nhimself from home every Friday, and becoming uneasy he\nset some one to watch him. He was seen to leave the\ncity at smiset in company with this native ; but none\nwould follow them, as they did not like the idea of\nspending the night outside. On the last Friday, however,\none bolder than the rest followed them, and concealing\nhimself behind a rock, witnessed their proceedings. On\nthe Saturday following a formal complaint was laid before\nthe Governor of the town, the native was banished for\nlife, and S. came over to England. After an absence of\ntwo years, my brother returned to the town, and a few\nweeks afterwards I received a letter from him, saying\n:\n'\nImagine my intense surprise, the same native is here, but\nno one recognizes him, he says he is determined to go on\nwith his project if I will assist him ; I can see no dif-\nference whatever in his appearance, he is not disguised in\nany way, and yet not a soul in the town has the slightest\nnotion that he is the man who was banished three years\nago.'\n\"\nNo. 71.\n\u2014\nAshley House.\nOn the 10th [April, 1869], Home went into a trance,\nand said, \" Allan Kardec,\u2014apoplexy.\" \" Did he die\nsuddenly ?\n\" I asked. \" Of apoplexy\u2014fell down stairs.\nYou must not sleep in the same room with Dan at\npresent, it is not good for either of you, your magnetism\nis mutually injurious, you take strength from each other ;\nyour nerves are in an excited state, I can see them\nemitting a phosphorescent light, they are stretched to\nthe extreme verge of tension.\" \" They are then in an\nunhealthy state,\" I said. \" Yes, in a condition that\nmust be checked, it is exactly as if you had taken too\nmuch stimulant.

Did it frighten\nhim ?\n\" \" Oh, yes ; he used to howl at him and frighten\nhim a good deal, so much so that one night he got up\nand slept with one of the other fellows ; he was afraid\n\f260 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nto be alone.\" Home turned to me and said, \" You must\nlook out, boy, there seems to be a storm brewing for\nyou.'' \" If you would tell me what it is,\" I said, \" per-\nhaps I might avoid it.\" \"It is of no great consequence ;\nit will be but a storm in a coffee pot. Oh, Dan is very\nweak, very weak indeed.\" Home sank back in his chair,\nhe was seized with a violent spasm in the chest, and was\nin great pain. Presently he said, They are magnetizing\nme.\" He fell into a natural sleep, and awoke in a short\ntime much better. Home went home, I remained some\ntime longer. Lindsay asked IVIr. Bergheim to mesmerise\nhim ; he did so, and soon put him to sleep. After he\nhad awoke him, Mr. Bergheim asked Lindsay to try upon\nhim, no one having as yet succeeded in mesmerising him.\nAfter a few passes, he went off ; he became very uneasy,\nplaced his hand on his forehead and said, \" It is all\nwrong.\" Lindsay asked him whether there was too much\nweight on his head ; whether he should take some off, or\nput more on. He replied, \" No, it is not that, but it is\nall wrong, I am being cross-mesmerised.\" (This is curious,\nas no one else was attempting to influence him.) As he\nseemed so uneasy, Lindsay awoke him. He told us he\ndid not remember saying anything about cross-mesmerising,\nbut that the last thing he recollected was seeing a figure\nor form of some sort standing beside Lindsay. He also\nsaw the figure. After some time, Lindsay mesmerised\nhim again ; as on the first occasion, be became very\nrestless and excited ; he extended his right arm, and kept\nit in that position for fully half an hour ;\nLindsay could\nnot induce him to alter it. He spoke Arabic with great\nrapidity in long sentences, and occasionally repeated\nsingle words which I wrote down as well as I could. He\nappeared to be, or to think himself to be, under some\ninfluence more powerful than Lindsay. He said among\nother things, \" Mabidah ('she won't'). Oh, dear, she\nwon't come. Ta-aU, ta-ali (' come, come !\n'\n\u2014word feminine\nand applicable to a woman only). Rabat ! (' she is\ngone '). Allah ! (God) Bedosh, or Behash (he won't, or\nshe won't), Haldl Inglese or Hekil Inglese, or Yikkil Inglese,\nor Hakal, Inglese (EngUsh talk, or speak Enghsh, or\n\fNO. 73] With D. D. Home 261\nhe speaks English, or he spoke Enghsh).\" Lindsay\nrepeatedly tried to make him speak Enghsh, but he said,\n\" he won't let me.\" Lindsay endeavoured to influence\nhim to move, but he always replied, \" he won't let me,\nI would if I could, but he won't let me, he is so strong.\"\nPresently he said, \" Chahni ! chalini ! (leave me, leave me),\ndon't let him come near me.\" Lindsay walked round in\na circle, making passes, and said, \" there, he cannot come\ninside that.\" Mr. Bergheim said, \" Ah, she has come,\"\nand appeared to stroke and caress some one's head and\nhair. \" He cannot speak Enghsh and won't let me.\"\n\" Ah, Ta-ah (oh, come) Chahni ! chahni ! (leave me, leave\nme) Rah, (he is gone). Oh, he has gone, and she has\ngone with him.\" He appeared so distressed that Lindsay\nsaid, \" I will awake him.\" He sat up and said, \" You\ncannot, he has gone, and you cannot awake me.\"\nLindsay began making upward passes, saying, \" nonsense,\nof course I can awake you.\" JMr. Bergheim shouted at\nhim, \" You cannot, you cannot, he must come back or\nI shall die, you cannot awake me ;\noh, bring him back.\"\nLindsay said, \" All right, he shall come.\" I opened the\ndoor and Lindsay added, \" There, he has come.\" Mr.\nBergheim heaved a deep sigh, and said, \" Oh, yes, he\nhas come back,\" he became quite quiet and soon awoke,\nbut was in a nervous state for some time.^\nNo. 14:.\u2014Ashley House, April [1869].\nLast night soon after we had gone to bed, we both\nheard raps upon the wall. The alphabet was called for\nand the following messages given, \" Come come, Dan,\ncheer up ! You have been overdoing it lately, ive intend\ngiving you a rest from the day after to-morrow till the 29th ;\nyour power will he taken from you.'' Home said, \" I am\nsorry for it.\" \" We think it best,'\" was answered. Home\nwent into a trance ; he said, \" Your grandfather is here,\n1 I mention the occurrences of this evening, as although outside the\npresent limits of \"Spiritualism,\" they seem to bear a strong resemblance\nto what took place at Ashley House, mentioned in pp. 249, 250.\n\f262 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nhe is not pleased.\" He spoke to me for a long time,\nrepresenting my grandfather, saying at the close of the\nconversation, \" You must be prepared, boy, for some\nchange ; it seems that something will soon occur to alter\nyour prospects.\" \" Can you not tell what it is,\" I asked.\n\" No we cannot tell you. Oh ! it is nothing to do with\nyour marriage ;\nno, it just seems that something will\noccur to alter your plans, that is all.\" \" I wish to ask\na cpiestion,\" I said. \" Do so,\" he replied. \" Dan sud-\ndenly asked me yesterday, shuddering, to take my hand\noff the table where we were both writing ; when I asked\nhim some time after what his motive had been for doing\nso, he told me that my thumb was all covered with\nblood. Now, there was really no blood upon my thumb ;\nwas that merely a defect in Dan's vision, or the result of\nhis imagination, or was there anything more in it ?\n\"\nAfter a pause Home answered, \" We do not know what\nthat could have meant, it might have been a foreshadow-\ning of something, or merely the reflection of the red\ntable cloth, or some purely physical effect of Dan's brain,\nor vision ; we do not remember the occurrence\u2014Stop\n!\nwait a minute \" (after a pause), \" Ah ! Sacha says it was\nnot imagination or deception on Dan's part, he was in one\nof those very curious conditions into which he sometimes\nfalls, and it was a foreshadowing of something that will\noccur, blood will flow, you may perhaps cut your finger\nor something of that sort, it does not follow that it will\nbe your thumb. Sacha sends all manner of love to Dan,\nand wishes you to tell him that he must not be low-\nspirited, more than he can help ; it is not right, he has\nnever wanted as yet, she says it is extremely unlikely\nthat he will be permitted to want now.\" I said, \" I\nwant to ask your opinion about what occurred in Lind-\nsay's room.\" \" We do not know exactly to what you\nrefer ; but we will tell you about it some time or other.\nDan is very weak and ill, we have been having a regular\ncouncil about him.\" \" I hope you will be able to do him\ngood,\" I said. \" Oh yes, we hope so, he is overworked ;\nand he worries himself about leaving the house, and is\ndistressed about a lot of jewels and precious stones.

Your\nmother seems anxious about you ; she says your position\nis not a very easy one ;\nyou have a difficult path to\nfollow, and must be careful.\" I said, \" It seems hard\nthat if I am in difficult circumstances I should have\nlost the advantage of her advice ; there are so few people\nwith whom I can take counsel.\" \" Ah, but that is just\nwhat she does not want you to feel. She says you have\nnot lost the benefit of her advice ; she can influence you.\nIf you will, when in doubt as to what course to pursue,\npray earnestly to God for guidance, and sit down quietly\nto think the matter over, she says you may be sure she\nwill be there, and will be enabled to help you to form a\nright judgment. She smiles, and says, '\nYou may even\nsmoke your cigar you know, my boy, if you like ;\njust\nsit down quietly by yourself, desiring earnestly and\nprayerfully to do what is right, and I am certain to be\nwith you, and will endeavovir to influence your mind so\nthat you may come to a right conclusion about Bergheim.'\nYou need never be nervous at anything of that sort ;\nno harm could have come of it ; no spiritual influence\ncould or would hurt him.

Dan wiU\nnot awake, he will fall into a natural sleep now.\"\nTVo. 75.\n\u2014\nSeance, Orafton Hotel, Albemarle Street, May 26fh\n[1869].\nAt about 10 o'clock I went to the Comtesse de Pomar,\nand found aheady assembled and seated round the table\nthe Comtesse de Pomar, Mrs. Crawford, Madame de Galiano,\nMrs. H. Senior, Mr. Bergheim, and Home ;\nthey had had\nslight physical manifestations. One of the ladies was not\nvery well, and another was expecting to be obliged to\nleave every minute\u2014two circumstances which no doubt\nacted unfavourably upon the harmony of the party.\nSoon after my arrival Home went into a trance ; he was\napparently much distressed by the black crepe on Madame\nde Pomar s dress. Getting up, he took a black shawl\nthat she had laid on a chair, and expressing by his coun-\ntenance the greatest disgust, he opened the door of an\ninner room and threw the shawl down. On coming back\nhe whispered as he passed me, \" We do not like it at all\n\u2014there is too much black. You see there are four what\nyou call widows here ; we cannot bear mourning.\" He\nstroked and patted my forehead ; and going round to\nMrs. \"s son, he bent over him, looked into his face\nand caressed his hair. He took a small round table\nthat was standing in the corner of the room, and said,\nstill in a whisper, \" Paula and Marie must not have too\nmuch confidence in this, it is an undeveloped influence\nthat communicates with them, and they are not fully\ndeveloped as mediums, they must not place implicit\nrehance on what is told them, but use their own sense\n\fNO. 75] With D. D. Home 265\nabout it.\" Oil returning to his chair\u2014as he passed me\n\u2014\nhe clapped liis hands (Adah Menken's sign), and\nwhispered, \" I hope you are very happy. It was not far\nfrom here that I met you.\" iVIr. Bergheim and I were\ntalking in a very low tone, about crystals, mirrors, and\neastern magic in general, and the strange things that had\noccurred at Ashley House in connection with Mr. J 's\nbrother. Home became much agitated, gasped occa-\nsionally for breath, had difficulty in speaking, and made\npasses before him as if waving something off. \" Oh,\"\nhe said, \" you must not talk of that, you bring such a\nfearful influence about you ; the moment your minds are\nturned in that direction, the influence comes as it were\npouring in, I wish you could understand this, you would\nsee how necessary is prayer to bring a good influence\nabout you ; and if you wish for that which is bad, it\nwill inevitably come. Oh, it is very dangerous, we can-\nnot bear you to have anything with magic, that incense\nof blood is fearful.\" I interrupted him saying, \" I have\nnot used any incense.\" Home continued, \" Oh, yes ;\nI know, I know. You must not have anything to do with\nit ;\nyou do not know how dangerous it is. Pray leave\nthat magic alone ; what is the use of it ? it is but\ncuriosity and can do you no good. Would you place\nyourself in the power of the lowest men on earth ?\nWould you bring the worst and most degraded of mortal\ninfluence about you ? You would not ; then why do so\namong spirits ? I tell you you do not know the danger ;\nthey are so fearfully low, the very lowest and most\nmaterial of all ;\nyou might almost call them '\naccursed.'\nThey will get a power over you that you cannot break\nthrough. Have nothing to do with it. Try and get a\ngood influence about you, one that will raise and elevate\nyou, not one to drag you down lower and lower. You\nwould be afraid of the worst and most brutal of your\nfellow-men. You have more cause to fear those spirits\nwho correspond to them if you encourage and let them\ngain power over you. No, he has not found it yet.\"\nBergheim said to me, \" Have you told him the story ?\nhow does he know anything about this ?\n\" Home laughed,\n\f266 Ex'periences in SjnriiuaUsm [seance\nand speaking to Madame de Pomar said, \" They are\nwondering at Dan speaking about subjects with which he\nis not acquainted, as if we did not know all about it.\"\nTurning to us he continued, \" No, he has not found it,\nhe has got your letter ;\nyes I think he will answer it in\na little time, he does not quite know what to do. I say\nagain, have nothing to do with magic. Mind ! there is\na storm coming, if that box arrives, if the house is not\nburned or smashed to pieces it wiU be a wonder. Seek\nby prayer to repel evil influences, do not encourage them.\"\nSoon after, Home awoke. We had tolerably strong\nphysical manifestations, but nothing remarkable occurred,\nand afterwards the three following messages were given\nthrough the alphabet, with short intervals between them :\n\" We find material hindrances impeding our manifestations.''\n\" The infliiences are too various.\" \" We must, though\nreluctantly, say '\ngood night.''\n\"\n[The three following Seances are recorded by Lord\nDunraven].\nNo. 76.\n\u2014\nSeance, No. 7, Buckingham Gate, June 25th [1869].\nPresent :\n\u2014Sir Robert Gore Booth, Augusta Gore Booth,\n]\\Irs. Honywood, Arthur Smith Barry, Miss A P ,\nMiss C R ; Ml'. Home, and myself. In a very\nshort time vibrations and slight movements of the table\noccurred. These were followed by raps on and about the\ntable. Augusta was Ij^ng on a low couch close to the\nground. The five raps for the alphabet being given, we\nreceived the following message :\n\" The position of Augusta\nabsorbs our atmosphere ; raise her.\" We placed her couch\non a sofa, and brought it up to the table. The sofa\npresently moved a few inches from the table, which was\nshortly moved up to it. She mentioned that the couch\nwas shaken, and also that she was touched several times.\nBeing just then strongly touched on the knee, I asked,\n\" Has any one else been touched 1\n\" \" You,\" was immedi-\nately rapped out. Mr. Home remarking that the influence\n\fNO. 76] With D. D. Home 267\nseemed chiefly on one side, we received the following\nmessage: \"We are obliged to keep to this side of the\ntable.\" This was on Augusta's side, opposite to that at\nwhich the two young ladies sat. Mx. Home remarking,\nthat, if the white tablecloth was put on the table, hands\nmight visibly move under the cloth, we accordingly put\none on. He asked if there was an accordion in the\nroom. Arthur Barry fetched one from the side-board,\nand placed it on the table. Some movements under the\ncloth were seen about the edge of the table near Augusta,\nand in other places. As no intimation was given about\nthe instrument, Mr. Home took it, holding it with one\nhand as usual, at the under edge of the table. A sort\nof prelude was played with slight tremolo effect. We\nthen had the following message, the letters being chiefly\nindicated by notes on the instrument :\n\" There is spiritual\ndiscord\u2014we pray for harrno7iy.\" The word discord was\ngiven by a horrid discord being played ; while harmony\nwas expressed by beautiful soft chords. While the play-\ning was going on, Arthur Barry and the two young ladies\nwere requested to look under the table to see how the\ninstrument was held and moved. Just after the last\nmessage, we received the following : \" An undeveloped\ninfluence prevents our \" here some shglit break\noccurred, and then it went on, \" but ivith prayer\u2014earnest\nprayer\u2014we will dispel it.'' This was shortly followed by :\n\" We must dispel the discord ; Arthur, sit opposite.'''' He\nremoved to the chair opposite Mr. Home, changing places\nwith Sir Robert. Mrs. Honywood was next to Mr. Home,\nand Sir Robert was next to her. Mi. Home's chair was\npartly turned round, and shght movements of the table\nand of Augusta's sofa took place. The alphabet being\ncalled for, the following message, addressed to IMr. Home,\nwas given :\n\" You were surprised, Dan, that you ivere\nturned round ; we wish to convince an undeveloped spirit\nthat you could 7wt trick, even if you wished to do so.\"\nMr. Home expressed the greatest wonder what this could\nmean. \" Convince a spirit,\" he said, \" how very odd ;\nan undeveloped spirit ; I cannot understand it at all.\"'\nHe then reminded me of the seance in which he employed\n\f268 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nthe fire test to satisfy spirits {No. 30). I said, \" Ask if\nany one else understands what this message signifies.\"\nHe pointed to each of us ;\nand when his hand was\ndirected to me and to Mrs. Honywood, three raps were\ngiven. Some rather undecided indications were heard\nwhen opposite one of the young ladies. Soon after, this\nmessage was sent : \" Robert, change with Barbara \" (Mrs.\nHonywood). Slight movements were now seen under the\ncloth near Augusta, and near Sir Robert. Augusta was\ntouched several times ; Mr. Home remarking that this\nmight be for some good purpose. We received the follow-\ning :\n\" It is with intent to heal, and with God's aid we\niviliy This was nearly all spelled out by notes on the\naccordion ; each of the letters of the word \" God \" being\nindicated by very soft chords, and the last two words by\nvery loud notes. This was followed by, \" Patience,\ndarling.\" The accordion was now played with great\npower, like a sort of jubilant hymn. It was pulled with\nsuch force that Mr. Home was obhged to hold it with\nboth hands. At one time it was drawn away till Mr.\nHome's arm was stretched out ; the instrument being\nquite horizontal ; the arm and accordion bending round\nthe head of Augusta's couch. It also rested on the edge\nof the couch, and was played there. Then it was brought\nround across the table back to Mr. Home's body, and\ncarried under the table. This was a curious manifesta-\ntion. He placed it on the ground, and it moved about\nunder the table, touching me and others. Soon after this,\nas Mr. Home was talking, he was arrested in the middle\nof a sentence\u2014his words died away\u2014his half outstretched\narm seemed to become rigid, and he passed into the\ntrance. He got up and walked about the room, ap-\nparently in a very uncomfortable state. Going over to\nthe piano he played a few chords, but quickly left ofE,\nseeming cold and distressed. He again walked about for\na little while, when, coming over to Augusta's sofa, he\nknelt down as if in prayer ; then taking her hands he\npatted them, and made passes down her arm. After this\nhe went behind Arthur Barry, and putting his hands on\nhis head he exclaimed, \"It is much too cold here !\n\" He\n\fNO. 76] With D. D. Home 269\nnext came and stood behind me for a few seconds, and\nthen nearly behind Miss C. R's. chair, when he dehvered\na short address, beautifully expressed ; but of which\nunfortunately I retain but a slight recollection. Every\nword was admirablj^ chosen, referring chiefly to this un-\ndeveloped spirit. He began something to this efiect :\nThat a home was once opened for the souls of men ; but\nthrough sin it was closed and sealed. From the moment\na man is born, the door of heaven is closed against him ;\nbut he is given a golden key which unlocks the golden\ngate by which he may enter in, and let out the golden\nwaters of the lake. That key is prayer, through which\nour spirits force their way before the seat of God. That\nSpirituaUsm is not a subject for idle curiosity, but for\nsteadfast pursuit. Then speaking of occupations, he said,\nthat even such amusements as music, drawing, &c., if\ncarried on too much, would lead you away from higher\npursuits, and ought to be resisted. He ended by saying,\n\" There is much we would see altered ;\nyou must pray ;\ndo not doubt ; it will be done ;\nonly pray, all will come\nright.\" This was obviously addressed to the lady behind\nwhose chair he stood. Turning to Arthur Barry he said,\n\" You don't understand this now, but you will by-and-\nbye \"\n;\nalluding no doubt to what will be explained\nfurther on. Approaching Mrs. Honywood, he said,\n\" Barbara, your father is here ;\nyou have been uneasy in\nyour mind lately, but never mind, all shall be made\nsmooth.\" Then putting his hand on Sir Robert's shoulder,\nhe said, \" You were touched by two hands, belonging to\ntwo very dear to you, one large, the other . smaller and\nmore delicate. Augusta, you felt a hand touching you,\nand a small pointed finger put into your hand (which she\ndid) ; this was your grandmother ; she is very much\npleased ;\nthey would like to have done more, but they\ncould not.\" Rapidly approaching me, he said with\nemphasis, \" You knew well who was playing.\" After\nthis he sat down and awoke, remarking how very silent\nwe all were. No more manifestations occurred of any\ninterest ; one of the ladies left the room, and Mr. Home\nsoon after said he felt tired, and we broke up the seance.\n\f270 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nAt supper one remarked that a chair was being moved\nto the table ; while our attention was called to this,\nanother chair moved rather quickly five or six feet to\nwithin a foot of the table, near Mr. Home. This was\nseen by all present. His chair was turned half round,\nand he took his feet off the ground while being moved.\nThere were no further manifestations.\nThe occurrences which form the remarkable feature of\nthis seance require explanation. Some days ago I had\nthe opportunity of seeing Miss C R write, under\nsupposed spirit-influence, in my presence. I obtained\npermission to put a few questions. Among them I asked,\n\" What do you think of Mr. Home ?\n\" Miss R\nwrote instantly, \" He has a certain degree of power, but\na vast amount of trickery.\" In answer to another ques-\ntion was written, \" He (Home) deceives people by pretend-\ning that he can call up the spirits of their friends, &c.\"\nThese and other answers made me think that this was\nprobably a deceitful spirit. The young lady being very\nanxious to be present at a seance, I invited her to this\none, expecting that something curious would probably\noccur. I mentioned the circumstances to Mrs. Honyvs^ood,\nbut neither she nor I had any communication with Mr.\nHome on the subject. At the seance he had no idea\nwho she was. The reader will now perceive the remark-\nable drift of what took place. The first message bearing\non the case was, \" We are obhged to keep to this side of\nthe table,\" that is, the side opposite Miss C R .\nThe next was, \" There is spiritual discord, &c.\" Then\nfollowed that about the undeveloped influence ; and after-\nwards in addition, the remarkable one addressed to\n\" Dan \" (Mr. Home) where the very word \" trick \" is\nemployed which was written by Miss C R with\nreference to Mr. Home. These messages were, so to say,\nsupplemented by the beautiful and pointed address uttered\nby Mr. Home, when in a trance, standing behind Miss R's.\nchair. Some days previous, I had mentioned to two\nfriends, very conversant with spirituahstic manifestations,\nthe character of several of the answers written through\nMiss C R , and they both pronounced them to\n\fNO. 76] With D. D. Home 271\nproceed from an undeveloped or low spirit ; one of a\nclass which appears to be by no means uncommon, par-\nticularly with young or incipient mediums. These friends\nwere ignorant of ]\\Iiss R.'s name, or that she was to be\nat a seance with Mr. Home. They, it will be observed,\nused the word \" undeveloped,'' the same as was employed\nin the messages this evening ; and they both recom-\nmended the same remedy, as was iirged by Mr. Home in\nthe trance, namely earnest prayer. The table was lifted\noff the ground, but only a few inches. The drawer of\nthe table on Augusta's side was suddenly opened.\nNo. 11.\u2014Seance, No. 1, Buckingham Gate, July 1st [1869].\nPresent :\n\u2014The Dowager Duchess of St. Albans, Lady\n, Mrs. Honywood, Mrs. Stopford, the Honourable\nMrs. , Arthur Smith Barry, Sir R. Gore Booth,\nAugusta Gore Booth, Mr. Home, and myself. We sat\nround the same table which we used on the last occasion,\nthe room being hghted as before by one lamp, with the\nshade over it. We quickly had strong vibrations, and\nraps of various kinds, some of them very loud. I said,\n\" I wonder if it is Dr. Elhotson ?\n\" \" Yes,'' was answered\nby three loud raps. The table was slightly moved in\ndifferent directions, and strongly tilted ; but I observed\nthat when inclined, objects sUpped down it. The Duchess\nof St. Albans was touched, both audibly and visibly to\nothers. The Duchess's scarf was pulled so strongly that\nshe said had it not been for the brooch it would have\nbeen pulled off. Mrs. , Mr. Home, and I were also\ntouched. The accordion was taken by Mr. Home, and\nit commenced playing in the usual manner. Mr. Home\nsaid, \" If you will ask for some air they will perhaps play\nit.\" The Duchess asked for \" Home, sweet Home,\" which\nwas given at first by single notes and afterwards by\nchords. The Duchess and Mrs. Stopford looked under the\ntable while the instrument was being played. It Avas\ndrawn about outside the table and back again. It was\n\f272 Experiefices in Spiritualism [seance\nplaced in the Duchess's hands, and played when she alone\nheld it. It was then put down under the table, where it\nmoved about, touching different persons' feet. It came\nup on my legs, and I took hold of it. I asked was it\nthe same spirit that played the other night, and was\nanswered by the alphabet, \" A rude imitation only.'\"\nAfter a httle while we got the following : \"All present\nare loving frieyids and messengers from God.\" Part of this\nmessage was given by the accordion ; the word God being\nindicated by soft chords. I asked if they would play the\nsame air as they did at Adare. No reply was given.\nMrs. Honywood's handkerchief was taken from her. Mrs.\nfelt a hand placed in hers.\nSome time after this, a little pencil with which I had\nbeen writing dropped out of my hand, much to my sur-\nprise, and fell at my feet. I tried to find it, but could\nnot. Shortly after, Mr. Home said, \" I see a hand\nmoving about the Duchess's shoulder.\" She felt some-\nthing coming down over her shoulder, and we then\nperceived a slight object on the edge of the table cloth\nin front of her. I saw it come down, or placed there.\nSome one said, \"It is a little pencil.\" \" Oh,\" I said,\n\" I dare say it is mine,\" which on examination it proved\nto be. We then got this message :\n\" We took it from\nDunraven for you ; take it.\" I gave the pencil to the\nDuchess. A drawer that was exactly opposite Lady\nD , shot out quite suddenly, so as to startle her ; this\nhappened several times. It was also shut. Once it was\nopened so far, that althovigh they tried they could not\nshut it. The cloth was moved as if by hands under it.\nMr. Home saw hands, as did Mrs. . She also saw\ndark forms behind the screen and near the door.\nPresently we received the following message, partly on\nthe accordion :\n\" God bless you. One ivho watches over\nyou \" ; and then \" Oft in the stilly night \" was softly\nplayed. This was the air I alluded to when I asked if\nthey would play the air they had played at Adare ; but\nI was not the least thinking of it at this time. Soon\nafter, Mr. Home went gradually into a trance. He got\nup, bandaged his eyes and walked about. He knelt down\n\fNO. 77] With D. D. Hoyne 273\nbeside Augusta, and patted her arms sharply, and made\npasses down them. He came round, and stood behind\nseveral of us. When between Arthur Barry and me, he\nspoke in a loud whisper, saying that Lady D might\nbecome a medium if she wished it ; that she had decided\nmediumistic powers. I said, \" Will she succeed ?\n\" \" That\ndepends,\" he rephed, \"entirely on herself, not upon us.\"\nHe said that a beautiful spirit was standing near her,\nand that her power would be good, and the manifesta-\ntions dehcate in accordance with her nature, which is\npure ;\nhe added more to the same effect. He also said\nto Smith Barry, \"Arthur, the spirit that touched you\nwas from D 's influence.\" Then in a sort of side\nwhisper, he said to me, \"You will explain to them that\nDan always calls people by their Christian names. A\nspirit, Arthur, pressed on your knee with one hand, while\npicking up the pencil with the other.\" He also said to\n^I's. , \"I see the spirit of Arthur (her husband?).\nstanding behind you.\" And he said something about\nGeorge, which was, I beheve, addressed to Mrs. Hony-\nwood. He then returned to his chair, and soon awoke.\nScarcely the shghtest manifestation occurred after this,\nand we left the table. At supper nothing took place.\nI omitted to state that the table was raised on one occa-\nsion at least 18 inches from the floor ; also that a very\ncurious manifestation occurred\u2014an extraordinary rattling\ninside the drawer, very strong and loud. Our chairs also\nvibrated, and so did, once or twice, the floor. The\nvariety of raps, and the strength and frequency of the\nvibrations at this seance were remarkable. The principal\nobject aimed at appeared to be to convince the Duchess\nand Lady D ,\nby the physical manifestations, of the\nreaUty of some invisible power.\nNo. 78.~Sea7ice, 7, Buckingham Gate, July 1th [1869]\nPresent (in the order in which we sat) :\n\u2014The Dowager\nDuchess of St. Albans, Mr. Home, Mrs. Stopford, Sir R.\n\f274 Experiences in Spiritualism [seance\nGore Booth, Lady , Capt. G. Smith, myself, Miss\nGore Booth, and Mrs. Honywood. We sat at the same\ntable, and with the same light as before, but without the\ntablecloth. For some time we had but shght manifesta-\ntions : they were merely vibrations and faint cold currents.\nI was touched twice, and hearing some one making a remark\nabout being touched, I said, \" Who was touched ?\n\" The\nalphabet was called for, and the word \" Dunraven \" was\nspelled out. Mr. Home then went into a trance ; he\nbandaged his ej^es ; then walked about a httle. After-\nwards he appeared as if talking to a spirit, making a\ngood deal of pantomime, occasionally placing his hands\nround the glass of the lamp, apparently to diminish the\nlight ; he then put it on the table. He sat down and\nbegan forming an alphabet, as he did at Garinish ; after\nmaking a few letters he pushed the paper over to Captain\nSmith who completed it. He then gave us the following\nmessage by pointing at the letters :\n\" We will do the best\nwe can, hut the conditions are not favorable.\" Then,\n\" Elizabeth \" was spelled, which no one seemed to under-\nstand. Mr. Home then put the Duchess's scarf over his\nhead and face, but^ soon removed it. He took her hand\nand placed it to his jaws to shew that they were locked,\nso that he could not speak. He then spelled out, \" You\nare too positive \" ; and soon afterwards, \" There is a\nstrange mixture of unbelief, not existing the last time we\nmet.\" I remarked, \" I think I know what may account\nfor this difference \"\n;\nalluding to my having in my pocket\na relic which a friend had particularly requested me to\nwear. He pointed out this message :\n\" It matters but\nlittle to us ; believe in God and love each other.\" Then\nunderhning some of the letters, he put numbers, 1, 2, 3,\n&c., to several of them. He showed this to the Duchess,\nnot wishing, apparently, that we should see what he was\nabout ;\nhowever, she did not seem to understand the\nmeaning of what he did. It occurred to me to try the\neffect of putting away the rehc, so I got up, and walking\nacross the room, quietly placed it among some books on\nthe sideboard. Mr. Home then pointed out the word\n''Talk.\"\n\fNO. 78] With D. D. Home 275\nSoon after he got up ; walked over to the sideboard,\nand returned and sat down. Then taking a piece of\npaper, he wrote in large letters, \" Where did you put it ?\n\"\nI rephed, \" Can't you find it ?\n\" He went over again to\nthe sideboard and came back, and, sitting down, showed\nme a cross which he wore, and which he partly drew out\nfrom his shirt collar. After this he took the lamp and\nplaced it on the sideboard, and while there two of the\nparty saw something in, or rather on one of his hands,\nwhen the hand was open. This must have been the\nreUc. He afterwards returned to the chair and sat down.\nCaptain Smith saw the rehc on the table before Mr. Home\nsat down. We saw it become visible just before he\nplaced his hands on each side of it. He then pushed it\nacross the table to me. The rehc is contained in a httle\ncircular box, about inches diameter. Soon after this\nMr. Home awoke.\nWe had vibrations of the table and raps. Mr. Home's\nchair was turned round ; he took his feet off the ground,\nand was either hfted up bodily several inches, or elongated\n;\nbut subsided almost immediately. Mr. Home asked for\nthe accordion. He took it ; and some chords were played,\nwith a discord among them. We then received the follow-\ning :\n\" Slight want of harmony.''' Mr. Home asked if any\nof us should change places ;\n\" Yes\/' was rephed. Mr.\nHome, by pointing to us consecutively, made out that the\nDuchess was to change with him. The accordion was\nmoved all round Mr. Home, and played some notes, when\nhis arm was stretched out ; it was placed at the Duchess's\nback, resting on her, and was played in that position.\nIt was then drawn under the table, Mr. Home holding it,\nand was given to Lady , who took it, and held it\nfor a short time. Very faint sounds were heard ; after\nwhich we got the message, \" Dan, take it.\" It played\nfor a httle time, and he then placed it under the table.\nPresently I felt a very sharp blow on the shin, and found\nthe accordion had struck me. Mrs. Stopford being obhged\nto go, left the room. Mr. Home remarked that he was\nsure we should have better manifestations now. We\nalmost directly received the following message by raps :\n\f276 Experiences in Spirihialism [seance\n\" We told you that the infliiences were contending ; there is\na change for the better.'\" Mrs. Stopford's chair now moved\nup to the table. Captain Smith said he saw a form\nmove it, and then sit in it. Three notes, for \" Fes,\"\nwere sounded on the accordion. The table was then\nslowly tilted to one side, and then the other, as if they\nwere trying to Mft it ; it then ascended more than a foot,\nand with two or more lifts, something hke what was done\nat Adare. After this the accordion was beautifully played\nwith tremolo effect at the end. It was then put under\nthe table. Sir Robert was touched by a hand that came\nfrom under the table cloth. Captain Smith saw a spirit\nform and hand coming from under the table. Mr. Home\nalso saw hands. Captain Smith asked who was sitting\nat the other end of the room. The word \" Father \" was\nspelled out ; also \" William.\" This word was given by\nLady 's dress being pulled. Captain Smith said,\n\" There is a reason why the chair moved up to the table ;\nwill you tell us ?\n\" No answer. \"Do I know it ?\n\"\n\" Yes \" was rapped out. Then, \" Sit at a small table four.\"\nMr. Home then pointed to us all to know who should\ngo, and the Duchess, Lady , Sir Robert, and he\nwere chosen by raps. The small table was tilted into\nMr. Home's lap. They then were told by raps, \" Put a\nbit of paper on the table.\" This they did. They took\nthe cloth off, and the table was raised above 45\u00b0 on one\nside, when the paper slipped. It was replaced. The\ntable was again inclined and the paper was slowly moved,\nrather up, then in different directions. After this the\npaper became luminous ; it was probably the hand hold-\ning it. The table was then inclined almost vertically,\nbut the paper did not move. The table was also made\nto feel Ught or heavy according to the wish of the persons\npresent. This was done very strongly. They now sent\nthe following message by raps :\n\u2014\" They do this to let you\nsee (a pause), now return to the large table.\" Very soon\nwe had the following :\n\u2014\" We are called away nearer God,\ngood night.\" We then left the table, at which we had\nbeen sitting for two hours and a half. At supper we\nwere talking about Lady 's glove being lost last\n\fNO. 78] With D. D. Home 277\nevening, and upon some one asking whether it had been\nfound, some one else said, \" I wish the spirits would tell\nus what became of it.\" Then we began talking about\nMr. Home looking for the relic, and how it was brought to\nthe table, whether by him or by a spirit. The subject\ncontinuing we were sent the following :\n\u2014\" He had it in\nhis hand at the side-hoard, hut ive placed it on the tahle.\"\nThese messages corroborated Captain Smith's opinion that\nHome did not place it there. Raps were heard all about,\non the table, hear the ceihng, and in different places. We\nreceived the following :\n\u2014\" The reason he could not find it\nwas that another spirit had taken it and hrought it to the\ntable.\" Then immediately followed, \" A^id we are very\ngood, are we not, Dan ? \" Upon which Mr. Home laughed\nimmoderately, as did also Mrs. Honywood. It was all a\nmystery to us, but afterwards he told us the meaning of\nthe message. It was about the prettiest manifestation of\nthe evening, but unfortunately I am precluded from giv-\ning any explanation. Mrs. Honywood knew the circum-\nstances of the case, and what the spirits meant by their\nforbearance in Dan's favour.\nThe cross which Mr. Home wore round his neck, and\nwhich he exhibited to me when he gave me the relic,\nwas a Russian one, bearing this inscription, \" In Thee\n0 Lord have I placed my trust, hell and the powers\nthereof may strive, but Thou art mighty and slialt\nprevail.\" The relic is said to contain a portion of the\ntrue cross.\nThe following interesting details were furnished to me\nby Captain G. Smith. \" It was quite at the beginning\nof the seance that I saw an object without apparent form\nmove near you under the table, and approach Miss Gore\nBooth. Home said, '\nI think they are trying to form\nhands.' The answer, '\nYes,' was faintly rapped out.\nPrevious to ]VIrs. Stopford leaving the room, indeed almost\nfrom the commencement, I had seen a tall spirit some-\ntimes standing against the window nearest the door, some-\ntimes sitting in an arm chair between the window and\n\f278 Experiences in Spiritualism with D. D. Home\nthe door. When Mrs. Stopford arose to go, he arose\nfrom his arm chair, and swept forward to the door. I\nfancied he was going out with her, but he returned to\nthe chair. The impression made on my mind was that,\nfor some good reason, he was prevented from entering\nthe circle. When Mrs. Stopford left the room, the large\ntable in the centre covered with flowers and books moved\ntwice, each time nearer Mr. Home and the Duchess, and\non each occasion he moved his arm chair too ; I think\nno one saw this latter movement but myself. It was\nthen as if to frustrate any further attempts on his part\nto enter the circle, that Mrs. Stopford' s chair was taken\nby a spirit (in appearance hke a pillar of cloud), and\nmoved up to the table. When the door was opened for\nsupper, the spirit in the arm chair passed out in front\nof me.\"\n\fADDENDA.\nNo. 1.\nCaptain Gerard Smith has kindly furnished me with the\nfollowing notes relative to the seances at which he was\npresent :\n\u2014\nOn p. 165, the hand which brought the sprig of box\nwas distinctly visible as it pushed the curtains aside,\nwhich partially overhung the window, and at our request\nit was again subsequently shown on the table, close to\nwhere Home was sitting.\nP. 167, with regard to the footnote, I am able dis-\ntinctly to state, that the only occasions upon which Home\nleft the room were to fetch the lemon, and at the con-\nclusion of this particular manifestation, to replace it in\nthe spot he had taken it from.\nNo. 49, p. 171. When I entered the room Home was\nwalking about with the accordion held in his left hand\nonly, and it was playing ; not a distinct air, but a\nplaintive kind of dirge, now loud, and then dying away\ntill it became inaudible. When the spirit moved from\nLord Adare's side it seemed to pass over the table with\na sound hke the rusthng of silver paper ; Home then\nrose and stood at the window with his right arm extended,\nand the spirit seemed to sweep down until it rested with\nboth hands on his outstretched arm, looking up into his\nface. From the position in which I sat, the profile of\nthe face was perfectly visible to me, and when the two\nfaces approached each other to kiss, there was no apparent\ndifference in the degree of density of the two figures.\n\f280 Experiences in Spiritualism\nI have nothing further to add. The remainder of the\nmanifestations which occurred when I was present, have\nbeen most accurately and truthfully described.\nGerard Smith,\nCaptain, Scots Fusilier Guards.\nNo. 2.\nI have collected a few cases, illustrating some of the\nmost extraordinary of the phenomena, mentioned in the\npreceding seances.\nThe following remarkable case of the fire test has been\nkindly furnished me by Mrs. S. C. Hall :\u2014\n\" 15, Ashley Place,\n'\n\"July the 5th, 1869.\n\" Dear Lord Dunraven,\u2014You have requested me to\nrecall the circumstances of a seance that took place here\nseveral weeks ago. I have much pleasure in doing so,\nbut I never take notes. I am, however, certain of the\nfacts ;\nthough I shall not be able to place them in the\norder in which they occurred.\n\" We were nine (a greater number than Mr. Home\nlikes) ; we were seated round the table as usual, in the\nsmall drawing room, which communicates with a much\nlarger room ; the folding doors were pushed back into\nthe wall, and the portiers unclosed. I think there was\none lamp burning over the table, but a very large fire\nwas blazing away in the large room\u2014I know there was a\ngreat deal of light. The Master of Lindsay, the Rev.\nMr. Y\u2014\u2014, and his wife, Mr. Hall and myself, Mr. Home,\nand the Msses Bertolacci were present. We sat for some\nlittle time before the tremulous motion that so frequently\nindicates stronger manifestations commenced, but it was\nquickly followed by raps, not only on the table, but in\n\fWith D. D. Home 281\ndifferent parts of the room ; the table was moved up\nand down,\u2014lifted perfectly off the ground\u2014made '\nlight\n'\nand '\nheavy '\nat the request of one or two of the gentle-\nmen present ; and after the lapse of, I suppose, nearly\nan hour, Mr. Home went into a trance. Presently he\npushed his chair, or his chair was pushed away\u2014quite\naway from the table. He got up ; walked about the\nroom in his usual manner ; went to the fire-place ; half\nknelt on the fender stool ; took up the poker and poked\nthe fire, which was like a red-hot furnace, so as to increase\nthe heat ; held his hands over the fire for some time,\nand finally drew out of the fire, with his hand, a huge\nlump of live burning coal, so large that he held it in\nboth hands, as he came from the fire-place in the large\nroom into the small room ;\nwhere, seated round the table,\nwe were all watching his movements. Mr. Hall was\nseated nearly opposite to where I sat ; and I saw Mr.\nHome, after standing for about half a minute at the back\nof Mr. Hall's chair, dehberately place the lump of burning\ncoal on his head ! I have often since wondered that\nI was not frightened ; but I was not ; I had perfect\nfaith that he would not be injured. Some one said\n\u2014\n'\nIs it not hot ?\n'\nMr. Hall answered\n\u2014' Warm, but not\nhot !\n'\nMr. Home had moved a little away, but returned,\nstill in a trance ; he smiled and seemed quite pleased ;\nand then proceeded to draw up Mr. Hall's white hair\nover the red coal. The white hair had the appearance\nof silver threads, over the red coal. Mr. Home drew the\nhair into a sort of pyramid, the coal still red, showing\nbeneath the hair ;\nthen, after, I think, four or five\nminutes, Mr. Home pushed the hair back, and, taking\nthe coal off Mr. Hall's head, he said (in the peculiar low\nvoice in which, when in a trance, he always speaks),\naddressing Mrs. Y ,\n'\nWill you have it ?\n'\nShe drew\nback ; and I heard him murmur, '\nLittle faith\u2014little\nfaith.' Two or three attempted to touch it, but it burnt\ntheir fingers. I said, '\nDaniel, bring it to me ; I do not\nfear to take it.' It was not red all over, as when Mr\nHome put it on Mr. Hall's head, but it was still red in\nparts. ]\\Ir. Home came and knelt by my side ; I put\n\f282 Experiences in Spiritualism\nout my right hand, but he murmured, ',No, not that ;\nthe other hand.' He then placed it in my left hand,\nwhere it remained more than a minute. I felt it, as my\nhusband had said, '\nwarm '\n;\nyet when I stooped down to\nexamine the coal, my face felt the heat so much that I\nwas obliged to withdraw it. After that Mrs. Y took\nit, and said she felt no inconvenience. When Mr. Hall\nbrushed his hair at night he found a quantity of cinder\ndust. Mr. Home was elongated, and all the manifesta-\ntions that evening were very remarkable ;\nbut I beheve\nyour Lordship requested me to relate only what I remember\nof the coal test.\n\" Dear Lord Dunraven, sincerely yours,\n\" Anna Maria Hall.\"\n(Mrs. S. C. Hall.)\nNo. 3. '\nThe following is an additional case of the fire test\nwitnessed at a seance held at Lady Louisa 's, at\nBrighton, furnished me by the Countess M. de Pomar,\nLady Gomni has permitted me to make use of her name\nin corroboration of the statement about the red-hot coal\nbeing placed in her hand.\n\" Mr. Home went into a trance ;\nhe walked about the\nroom ;\nplayed the piano ; stood behind Mr. Douglas's\nchair, who also went into a sleep or trance ;\nand Mr.\nHome appeared to be speaking with some one about him,\nand to magnetize him ; he said it was for his good, and\nwould remove his headache finally. Mr. Home went to\nthe fire and took out a large red-hot mass of coal, which\nhe held in his extended hands, and blew up to keep it\nahght. He walked up and down the room with it, then\nwent to Lady Louisa and wanted to put it in her hands,\nbut she drew back. He then said, 'No, you must not\nhave it, for if you have no faith, it will burn you.'\n\fWith D. D. Home 283\nLady Gomm extended her hands, saying, '\nI will take it\nwithout fear, for I have faith.' Mr. Home then placed\nthe burning mass in her hands, and she did not feel it at\nall, although she held it for at least one minute. It was\nafterwards put on a sheet of paper which directly began\nto blaze and had a great hole burned in it.\"\n\fCLASSIFICATION OF PHENOMENA i\nAnimals, future state of, 167.\nAccordion played, no one touching it, 193, 226.\nsupported, without human hands, 59, 193.\nArrow brought through the air, 189.\nAbbey, Adare, strange scene at, 195-99.\nAlphabet, drawn and decorated, 216.\nBrandy, glass of, emptied and filled, 147.\nessence extracted from, 148.\n(See also below, Flowers and Lemon.)\nElongation of Home, 63, 76, 97, 109, 155, 161, 178, 238,\n248, 249.\nFire test, 133, 135, 239, 280-83.\nFlowers, scent withdrawn from, 136, 165.\nbrought through the air and given to persons, 69,\n123, 124, 165, 166, 169, 183, 189, 207-9, 223,\n226, 237, 238.\nHarp, chords of, played, 205.\nIdentity tests, 90, 193, 236.\nLevitation of Home, 147, 149, 155, 161.178, 197, 275.\npassing from one window to another, 155.\nLights, visible, 64, 95, 115, 124, 132, 146, 157, 163, 165, 196, 209.\nLemon, taste, essence, &c., extracted from, 166, 173.\nLuminosity of objects, 94, 100, 276.\nof Home's head or hands, 68, 161, 195.\n^ So far as poss'ble the Classification of Phenomena given in the original\nedition has been kept, but for convenience of reference a few changes have\nbeen made\n.\n\fClassification of Phenomena 285\nMusio heard, 79, 91.\nObjects moving by themselves, 54, 92, 99, 276.\nPentecost, phenomena of, imitated, 157.\nPiano raised off the ground, 64, 209.\nRaps, stream of, like electric sparks, 53, 187.\nSecond sight, case of, 102.\nSign of the Cross made by table, 59, 183.\nSounds, 51, 55, 162, 195, 198, 233, 235.\nSpirit forms visible, 49, 79, 83, 92, 107, 115, 132, 146, 153,\n154, 157, 165, 170, 173, 196, 198, 202, 238, 252, 272,\n276, 277, 278.\nSpirit hands visible, 79, 100, 139, 169, 170, 192, 223, 224, 226,\n233, 272, 276, 278.\npersons touched by, 74, 79, 122, 124, 132, 164, 165,\n169, 170, 182, 185, 190, 193, 194, 206, 226, 266, 268, 274.\nSpirit-laughter, 51, 170.\nSpirit-voices, 55, 91, 94, 146, 163, 176, 204, 227, 233.\nTable raised in the air, 53, 74, 80, 169, 181,183, 185, 190, 193,\n194, 217, 218, 227, 237, 271, 276.\nTheological views, allusions to, 72, 89, 95, 116-20, 126, 130, 141,\n143, 151, 158, 173, 200, 204, 209\nWindow, Home passes from one to another, 155\nPRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BV ROBEKT MACl.EHOSE AND 00.

Leaning.\n' la le muet Silence un efcadron conduit\nDe fantofmes ballans dellous Faueugle nuict.\nPONTUS DE TyABD.\nI. Introductory.\nIn F. W. H. Myers' Glossary of technical terms he defines as\n\" hypnagogic \" \"the vivid illusions of sight or sound which\nsometimes accompany the oncoming of sleep,\" and similarly\nas \" hypnopompic \" those which accompany its departure.\nThese phenomena variously named \" Phantasmata,\" \" Ealhi-\ncinations Hypnagogiques\" and \"Faces in the Dark,\" are\na^ variety properly included by Dr. Wm. McDougall in\nhis table of hallucinations as among those observed by\nthe sane and the healthy under more or less abnormal\nconditions. The abnormality is so shght as to amount to\nno more than a certain degree of drowsiness, a twilight\ncondition of consciousness in which pseudo-hallucinations,\nwhich are neither waking visions nor dreams, can occur.\nBoth the latter have received a full measure of attention\nfrom psychic researchers, but the hypnagogic variety has\nto some extent fallen between two stools. They were ex-\ncluded from the census of hallucinations taken by the\nSociety for Psychical Research i\nand from Dr. Head's\n1 Proc. S.P.B., Vol. X. p. 78.\n\f290 F. E. Leaning. [part\nenquiry in 1901,^ and in none of the International In-\nquiries following on Psychological Congresses have they\nhad any place. ^ Yet the fact of their being entitled hal-\nlucinations implies that they do not belong to the fully\nrecognised and normal subject matter of psychology ;\nthey\nbelong to the middle ground between it and physiology,\nwhich is largely the proper field of psychic research.\nIt is v\/ith a view to calling attention to this little-\ncultivated area, which is yet rich in interest and illumina-\ntion for psychic science, that the following notes have\nbeen put together, and in the hope of paving the way, by\na careful collection and comparison of the evidence up to\nthe present, for further advance.\nIt is necessary, to begin with, to know what the facts\nare, and secondly, what interpretations of them have been\nproposed, and how far those proposed theories fit into the\nfour corners of the facts. We want to know, before\ntheory can be entered upon at all, as much as is possible\nof the conditions of occurrence, the relation to health,\ntemperament, the conscious and the unconscious make-up\nof the persons concerned, their sex, age, peculiarities,\npowers of sight, will, imagination, and so on ; and Avhat\nthe characteristics of the visions comprise which may\nrelate them instructively to other departments of which\nwe have fuller knowledge.\nII. The Data and Bibliography.\nIt is proper at this point to state as nearly as circum-\nstances allow, the extent of our resources for dealing with\nall these points. Briefly, the result of stocktaking is that\nwe have on the one side some seventy to eighty published\naccounts, including a few at second-hand, by the seers of the\nvisions, and on the other the reports of a small number of\nscientists and scholars who have collected and discussed the\ndescriptions, many having added their own experiences to\nthe rest. The actual descriptions range from the bare\nstatement that the writer has had the experience in ques-\n1 Proc. ^.P.B., Vol. XIX. p. 268.\n2 Parish, E. Hallucinations and Illusions (1897).\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 291\ntion, up to a sufficiency of detail for us to judge of it on\nthe ten or twelve counts which are involved in a typical\nvision, and among them are a surprisingly large proportion\nof people of eminence. It is evident, of course, that even\nwith this number of accounts, we have far too few to\ngenerahze upon, and although it is probable that a more\nwidely extended search through literature and biography\nwould yield a number of others, and that they would\nfollow broadly the same lines as those already in hand,\nyet we should still be in a position to do no more than\noutline the laws of their production. Such totally different\nconclusions are arrived at by minds envisaging exactly the\nsame facts, that only the accumulation of greater masses\nof observation can effect a final result.\nPutting aside the earliest descriptions by Cardano, a\nreference by the Bishop of Chalons-sur-Saone, Pontus de\nTyard,^ and by Vairo, Bishop of Pozzuolo,^ all three of the\nsixteenth century ; Simon Forman, astrologer,^ and Hobbes, ^\nwho could find \" no particular name \" for this \" kind of\nfancy \" in the seventeenth, we come to the group of\neighteenth century physiologists, of whom the greatest was\nJohann Miiller, friend and contemporary of Goethe.

(1909), and the\nmuch briefer contribution in Havelock EUis's World of\nDreams (1910). The scanty notice given by Walsh in the\nPsychology of Dreams (1920), and the more sympathetic\ntreatment in Mrs. Arnold-Forster's charming Studies in Dreams\n(1921) bring the roll down to the present day. With the ex-\nception of Maury and Frederick Greenwood in the last century,\nand recently Monsieur R. Warcollier, who, however, have dealt\nat length solely with their own visions, only one or two\nof these writers have given more than a niche to their\nconsideration, and not one has referred to the fine series\nof descriptions contributed from time to time to the\nJournal of the S.P.R., or made a comparative study of all\nthe available material.\nIII. Diffusion.\nThis and other circumstances naturally make it ex-\ntremely difficult to find out, even approximately, what\nproportion of people are affected. We can be quite sure\nof the one negative fact that the visions are not universal,\nas sleep is, and as dreams almost are. Maury, for\ninstance, a life-long and inveterate subject, tells us that\nhis mother never saw anything of the kind ;\n^ and Mrs. de\nMorgan never did, although her father had only to shut\nhis eyes to see a stream of \" houses, trees, temples,\nand other objects \" passing under his eyelids. ^ Miiller ^\nattempted to get some definite results by questioning the\nstudents who came up annually in fresh batches to attend\nhis classes at the University of Berlin. His conclusion was\nthat the visions were a phenomenon known to compara-\ntively few, for he sometimes found among one hundred\nonly two or three, and occasionally only one. In spite of\nthis he considers the rarity \" more apparent than real,\"\nlie Sommeil et lea Reves, p. 68 (1878).\n^ Three score Years and Ten, p. 66.\n^ Eletnenta of Physiology, vol. ii. p. 1394 (trans, by Wm.

Andrew Lang remarks in\nhis Introduction to Thomas's Crystal Gazing (p. xxix.) :\n\" Hypnagogic illusions appear to be matters of less common\nexperience than a person familiar with them, like myself,\nmight suppose.\" Galton ^ again, a pioneer of the \" ques-\ntionnaire \" method, though extending his enquiries in\nseveral directions and obtaining a very interesting collec-\ntion thereby, says nothing about the actual numbers whom\nhe reached. Yet most of the writers on the subject agree\nthat the experience is \" common.\" The correspondence in\nthe St. James's Gazette,^ produced by Galton's article in\nthe Fortnightly ^ of the previous summer, shows that the\nwriters considered the matter so usual as to be surprised\nat its being the subject of enquiry by a scientific man.\nAristotle,* to take the most ancient witness we have,\nsays \" anyone may convince himself if he attends to and\ntries to remember the affections we experience when sink-\ning into slumber.\" Taine ^ speaks of it as \" no rare ex-\nperience,\" \" many cases \" having been reported to him\ndirectly.

Here we have, beside many\ngeneral statements ^ such as those quoted above, a basis\nof statistical worth at last, in the valuable enquiry carried\nout and reported in the Pedagogical Seyninary, April, 1898\n(vol. V. p. 473), in which 826 children ranging from 3 to\n16 years of age were canvassed, results rising at the age of\n10 to 65%, and falling between the years of 13 and 16\nto 58-5. Taking into account the statements of many\nadults who have continued to see the visions from child-\nhood onward, but also allowing for many who do not, we\nmay perhaps surmise that \" most adults \" number reaUy\none-third of the total. The respective sexes of the children\nare not stated ; but in the whole list of witnesses available\nto the writer, the men outnumber the women by almost\n2 to 1. This may be, of course, because men have written\nmore largely than women,^ both in books and scientific\nperiodicals, and so would be quite misleading as an indi-\ncation of their actual predominance.\nThe census above alluded to showed the proportion of\nwomen seeing hallucinations as, generally, three to two of\nthe men ; but if we should turn out to be dealing with a\ndifferent faculty\u2014creative imagination, for instance\u2014we\nmust not too readily transfer conclusions drawn from\nanother class of experience. It may be of interest here to\nstate that at a lecture on the subject to an audience of\nabout 150 members of the London Spiritualist Alhance, a\nshow of hands at the close gave about 30 per cent, as\nseers of the visions. At the private meeting of the Society\nfor Psychical Research the proportion was found to be 27\nout of 65, or nearly 40 per cent. Allowing for the pre-\ndominance of a certain type, in the circumstances, this\nwould bring us to the 33 per cent, surmised above.\nThe point in itself may not be considered of great im-\n'^E.g., H.

Frequency of the Visions.\nThis varies within the widest possible range, from a\nsingle occurrence in a lifetime up to the habitual seeing\nby day, whenever the eyes are closed, and by night with\nthe eyes open or shut. Thus in the collection as a whole\nthere are a few cases where the visions occurred once only.\nThe following description is given by an Associate of the\nS.P.R.i\n\" I had gone to bed after a long journey, but was\ntoo tired to sleep, when suddenly the j)ortion of the room\nopposite my bed seemed to be flooded with light. This light\ngradually assumed the form of a circle about two or three\nyards in diameter, and then I saw distinctly a colotired\nlandscape with a cottage and some trees. I was wide\nawake at the time and very much surprised and interested.\nI had often heard of hypnagogic illusions and had read of\nan instance in the Daily Graphic not long before, but I\nimagined that they were only seen by persons who were\nhabitually subject to halliicmations. I had heard that\nthese visions were generally a reproduction of something\npreviously seen, but I could not remember having seen\nany landscape exactly like this one, although it is quite\npossible that I might have done so and forgotten it.\nWhen the vision gradually faded away I tried to produce\nanother by an effort of will, and succeeded, but the result\nwas very feeble compared with the first.\"\nAnother instance of a \\inique occurrence is related by\nthe late W. T. Stead in More Ghost Stories,^ the sequel of\nthe Christmas Number of the Review of Reviews, 1891.\n\" There was no light in the room, and it was perfectly\ndark ; I had my eyes shut also. But notwithstanding the\n^Jour. S.P.B., Vol. VIII. 171 (1897). ^\np. 26.\n\f296 F. E. Leaning. [part\ndarkness, I was suddenly conscious of looking at a scene\nof singular beauty. It was as if I saw a living miniature\nabout the size of a magic lantern slide. At this moment\nI can recall the scene as if I saw it again. It was a sea-\nside piece. The moon was shining upon the water, which\nrippled slowly on to the beach. Right before me a long\nmole ran out into the water. On either side of the mole\niiTegular rocks stood up above the sea level. On the\nshore stood several houses, square and rude, which re-\nsembled nothing that I had ever seen in house architecture.\nNo one was stirring, but the moon was there, and the sea\nand the gleam of the moonlight on the rijjpiing waters was\njust as if I had been looking out upon the actual scene.\nIt was so beautiful that I remembered thinking that if it\ncontinued I should be so interested in looking at it that\nI should never go to sleep.\nI was wide awake, and at the same time that I saw the\nscene I distinctly heard the dripping of the rain outside\nthe window. Then suddenly, without any apparent object\nor reason, the scene changed. The moonlit sea vanished,\nand in its place I was looking right into the interior of a\nreading-room. It seemed as if it had been used as a\nschool-room in the daytime, and was employed as a read-\ning-room in the evening. I remember seeing one reader,\nwho had a curious resemblance to Tim Harrington, although\nit was not he, hold up a magazine or book in his hand\nand laugh. It was not a picture ... it was there. The\nscene was just as if you M'ere looking through an opera\nglass ;\nyou saw the play of the muscles, the gleaming of\nthe eye, every movement of the unknown persons in the\nunnamed place into which you were gazing.\"\nThese, and a few other examples, are given in full here,\npartly to facilitate reference in discussing them later, and\npartly by way of relieving the subject by actual illustra-\ntion. Next to these cases come two which are probably\nrepresentative of a much larger number, in which the\nvisions occur over a very short period, about two or three\nnights in each case It is amusing to note the vigour of\nexpression, as of a man rather surprised and indignant.\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 297\nwith which the old Scotsman, Dr. Robert McNish de-\nscribes ^ how in March 1829, during an attack of fever,\nhe experienced \" illusions of a very peculiar kind.\" The\nfact that they only appeared in darkness was one of the\nmost distressing accompaniments, since he could not bear\nmuch Hght. \" I had the consciousness,\" he says, \" of\nshining and hideous faces grinnmg at me in the midst of\nprofound darkness, from which they glared forth in horrid\nand diabohcal relief. They were never stationary, but\nkept moving in the gloomy background. . . . They would\nfrequently break into fragments, which after floating about\nwould unite\u2014portions of one face coalescing with those of\nanother, and thus forming still more uncouth and abom-\ninable images.\" On the night on which his illness cul-\nminated, durmg five hours of severe headache, another\ntypical phase superseded that of the faces. To the\naccompaniment of a grand orchestral march, executed\nwith tremendous energy and more loudly than he had ever\nheard it before, \" I had a splendid vision of a theatre, in\nthe arena of which Ducrow, the celebrated equestrian was\nperforming. On this occasion I had no consciousness of\na dark background hke that on which the monstrous\nimages floated ; but everything was gay, bright and beauti-\nful. I was broad awake, my eyes were closed, and yet\nI saw with perfect distinctness the whole scene going on m\nthe theatre\u2014Ducrow performing his wonders of horseman-\nship\u2014and the assembled multitude, among whom I recog-\nnised several intimate friends.\"\nBostock ^ describes a similar short period during fever,\nbut free from delirium, and a more modern and very\npicturesque account is given by an Associate of the\nAmerican S.P.R.^ Next to these come the cases of which\nthe standard example is Nicolai of Berhn, though he\nbarely comes within our range, since his visions of busy\nmen and women, people on horseback, dogs, and birds,\nwere seen with open eyes and only sometimes with them\n1 The Philosophy of Sleep, ed. iii. p. 274 (1836).\n^Elementary System of Physiology, vol. iii. p. 204 (1824).\n^Jour.

It will be observed that\nthis is a feature of the short-period class. Scanty or\ninfrequent experience of the visions divides the percipients\ninto three groups. The first is constituted of several\ncases in which some scene has been vividly impressed on\nthe senses, or some object has engaged concentrated atten-\ntion during the day, and an absolute reproduction takes\nplace spontaneously against the background of darkness.\nExamples of this kind are Flournoy's vision of the chess-\nboard, the anatomical dissection on the first day of his\nintroduction to the study, and so on. He calls these\nhypnagogic, and speaks of having seen ten or twelve.\n^\nHobbes' geometrical figures, Miiller's microscopical prepara-\ntion, ^ Ferriar's interesting sights such as \"a romantic\nruin, a fine seat, or a review of a body of troops \" which\nhe would see at once on going into a dark room in the\nevening,* are all of this class. Further cases are given by\nDr. D. G. Stoney,^ Prof. Vignoli,\" and others.\nIn Volume XI. of Proceedings S.P.R. p. 360, a good\ntypical vision of this kind is described, received by Dr.\nHyslop from a student in New York. He had left college\nearly on the afternoon of March 17th, 1893, and on reach-\ning Fifth Avenue he says, \" I saw part of the parade of\nthe loyal sons of St. Patrick, with their green sashes,\nbanners with harps surmounted by fools' caps, and all the\nother paraphernaha.\" After attending to his afiCairs and\non returning home, \"as I was going up my front stairs,\nwhich are quite dark, I got a distinct picture of the\nparaders, green sashes, banners and all\u2014seemingly projected\n* The fiill account was given by Nicolai in a Memoir read before the\nRoyal Society of Berlin, Feb. 28, 1799.

It is placed\nhere because the narrator, although not drowsy, was in\ndarkness when the scene reproduced itself. Warcollier\nalso had visions of a test-tube, ^ and of a mineral substance\nwhich he had been studying in his laboratory, the latter\non his pillow, and strongly lighted.\nThe subjects in all of these instances except the last\neither have them only occasiona^Uy, or they belong to the\nsecond group, where the faculty ceases with childhood or\nadolescence. Thus Havelock Ellis ^ remembers only his\nvisions at seven years shared with a little cousin of the\nsame age ; Mrs. Haweis ^ in describing the drift of great\npink fragrant roses which she saw as a child of nine, says\nthat they became \" annually smaller, swifter, farther off,\"\nuntil by the time she was grown up they had become a\nmere speck. Dr. Stoney, referred to above, says \" often,\nas a lad,\" and various others give testimony to the same\neffect. Between these two groups, in which the visions\nare either few enough to be counted, or ceased altogether\nwith maturity, come those where apparently they begin in\nlater life and their development can be given a definite date.\nWhen they have once begun, it is evident that the expres-\nsions \" the last six years,\" \" eighteen months ago \" and\nso on, are of very relative value in a table of \" Fre-\nquency \" except as affording a starting point for further\nenquiry as to the probable cause. It would be of interest\nto know whether there is in such cases a recrudescence of\nyouthful faculty, which became submerged at the thres-\nhold of adult life, or an actual birth of it, and if so, why\nthe hour for it arrived when it did. It is to be noted\nthat in cases of late development the visions are inter-\nmittent and not continuous. Periods of vacant weeks or\nmonths will elapse, and then \" rushes \" will occur.\nWe now reach a line of demarcation after which the\naccounts all refer to, or imply, long periods of years and\nsuch expressions as \" generally,\" \" usually,\" \" for a long\n^ La Telepathie, pp. 53, 58. ^ World of Dreams, p. 30 (1911).\n^ Galton, op. cit., p. 165.\n\f300 F. E. Leaning. [part\ntime,\" \" frequently,\" are found. There is a great increase\nin numbers, and the class merges into that in which per-\ncipients say \" all my life,\" or \" as long as I can remem-\nber.\" These form quite the majority of the total avail-\nable for study, and it is fortunate that this is so, for it\nenables us to go a little more into types and tempera-\nments, and many other matters bearing on the subject,\nwhich the scantier records do not admit of. Maury is\nperhaps the example par excellence of the extreme type,\nsince he could not close his eyes even for an inappreciable\nsecond during reading aloud without having a vision.^\nIt may be in place here also to note that a tendency for\nthe visions to decrease either in size or in frequency some-\ntimes occurs, and that changes in the subject-matter are\nobserved, as for instance, when Sir John Herschel told\nMrs. de Morgan that late in hie he saw \" more faces and\nfewer landscapes than previously,\" ^ but Maury, on the con-\ntrary, saw fewer faces and figures, and more of natural\nscenery.^ It is possible that just as in childhood there\nare certain ages which mark culminating points, so adult\nlife also may have its periodical summits, but since to\nestabhsh this it would be necessary to know the ages of\nthe percipients in all the cases examined, that is at\npresent unattainable.\nV. Health.\nThe very first question which common sense puts upon\ndiscovering the existence of the phenomena, is as to the\nphysical conditions under which they are observed. Already\nwe have noticed several mentions of fever, as in the cases\nof McNish and Bostock. To these can be added that of\nthe American Associate referred to, who notes that he had\nnever seen the visions at any other time, that they ex-\nhibited great rapidity, remarkable variety in colour, scenery\nand movement, were sharply defined, but became fainter\nand less frequent as the temperature came down in the\ncourse of three or four days. Another contributor to the\n1 Maury, op. cit., p. 61.\n3 Op. cit., p. 91.\n2 De Morgan, op. cit., p. 70.\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 301\nsame volume ^ who says he sees constantly, but in good\nhealth ignores the visions unless he turns his attention to\nthem, yet \" when feverish cannot but see the kaleidoscopic\nviews.\" In another case ^ a lady, who with her mother\nhad always seen the \" dream faces,\" found when in fever\nthat a painful degeneration took place. The faces became\nhorrible and grotesque, and a blood-red veil seemed over\nthem. Nicolai's phantoms also faded, and became at last\ninvisible as the day of his treatment wore on. Maury,\nwho had a chronic tendency to cephalagia, cerebral con-\ngestion, and all manner of \" douleurs,\" bears witness to\nhis hallucinations being more numerous, and above all\nmore vivid, whenever he had especially taxed his powers,\nas in the notable instance of his two-days' struggle with a\nlong and difficult Greek passage. The visions came then\nwith such intolerable rapidity that he was obliged to sit\nup in bed to dissipate them.^ Baillarger also quotes\nMarc as referring to indigestion, nervous disturbance, or\nshock, as commonly productive of \"figures les plus gro-\ntesques, souvent les plus effrayantes \" at bed-time. His\ncollection of thirty cases, mostly patients at the Salpet-\nriere, naturally illustrates this point of view. Hyslop\nagain speaks of his having the experience \" quite frequently\nduring my tendencies to nervous prostration.\" * Walsh ^\nconsiders the hypnagogic condition favourable to nightmare,\nespecially to persons over-fatigued or in poor general\nhealth, and remarks (p. 222) that children in good health\nare not generally troubled by them. To him the visions\nare evidently a correlate of a nervous, impressionable\ntemperament, or of eyestrain and fatigue. The latter\ncause is in evidence in the first instance used in illustra-\ntion, where the subject was \" too tired to sleep.\" In\nW. T. Stead's case following that, he was in a similar\ncondition, having been working late for several nights over\nthe Review of Reviews, and in two or three other instances\nthe fact of being \" very tired \" is mentioned.\niJowr.

[part\nFrom all this it would appear that the condition of the\nbody generaJly, and the brain and optic nerve in par-\nticular, have a definite bearing on the phenomena, seeming\nto be directly responsible in some cases and a strongly\nmodifying factor in others in their production. But that\nthis is not the only conclusion may be seen from a com-\nparison of many other witnesses. It is by no means only\nthe nervous, the weary, and the sick who see the visions.\nOn the contrary, the great majority, who do not mention\ntheir physical condition at all, may thereby be considered\nto be normal, and Galton remarks,^ in his discussion of\n\" visionaries,\" on the surprisingly large number of sane\nand healthy people whom his enquiries brought to light as\nbelonging to that class. The constant seer and gifted\nliterary man, James Greenwood, who was no doubt one of\nthose \" five editors of influential newspapers \" to whom\nGalton refers, expressly speaks ^ of tired or disordered\neyesight as \" the most natural explanation \" and then\nadds :\n\" yet on no occasion, for my part, has there been\nany consciousness of either.\" He is quite definite that\nthey do not vary with the health. A lady of Gurney's\nacquaintance also denies any connection with health ;\n^ a\nyoung man of twenty-two states that his health was\nalways good;'' Sir John Herschel speaks of his impressions\n\" in health and under no kind of excitement \" ;\n^ and\nanother lady sees them \" when at my best physically.\" ^\nAmong the writer's correspondents delicate health is only\nmentioned once ; a lady who sees habitually replies that\nshe cannot trace any connection with health, and that she\nsees when tired and at other times when exhilarated, while\nanother refers to a break of several months caused by a\nlong illness. Burdach expressly states that the visions\nare not morbid, but occur to those in full health and\n^ Galton, Of. cit., p. 91.\n^ Greenwood, Imagination in Dreams, p. 24.\n^Phantasms, i. p. 492. * Proc.

Doctors naturally\nknow more of their patients than of the far greater multi-\ntude who are not patients.\nVI. Natural Vision and Hypnagogic Visions.\nThe next question that arises is whether any connection\nis traceable between the quahty of the physical sight, the\npowers of observation, and that power of reproducing\nclear mental images of things seen, which we term visual-\nisation, and the seeing of visions. As far as the merely\nphysical equipment goes, it does not appear that short,\npoor, or weak sight is any hindrance. Thus the lady\nabove referred to as seeing \" dream-faces \" when awake,\nsays that all are distinct \"as no real face ever is to my\nshort-sighted eyes.\" ^ Another refers to weak sight, pre-\nventing further study of painting,^ but not preventing\neither crystal visions or the coming of faces whenever the\neyes were closed, by day or night. Maury also suffered\nwith his eyes the greater part of his Life.* A correspondent\nof the Occult Review^ says: \"I see these things much more\nclearly and delicately than I could in the ordinary way,\nthough I have very good sight.\" Both observation and\nvisualising power must be to some extent dependent on\niSee table, p. 375 infra. ^ Jour.

[part\nthe physical sight, but here also natural deficiencies appar-\nently have no effect.\nWhen Galton made his special visualisation canvass of\none hundred persons, all of them more or less eminent in\nArt, Letters, or Science, he arranged the results in a\ntable showing good, moderate, and poor powers. And\nwe find nearly as many of the last as of the first class in\nour own data, always bearing in mind that we are not\nonly severely restricted in number, but further restricted\nto that small proportion of our total in which information\non the point happens to be volunteered. Galton himself\nsays \" I visualise with effort,\" and in another place ^\ncites two very poor visuahsers. Lang ^ remarks that \" bad\nvisuahsers, like the writer, who think in words, not in\npictures, see bright and distinct hypnagogic illusions.\"\nMyers ^ speaks of \" other bad visuahsers besides myself\nderivmg from hypnagogic illusions some notion of the good\nvisuahser's habitual capacity.\" Flournoy,* again, describes\nhimself as a \" very bad visuahser,\" whose memory images\nare \" weak, fragmentary, indistinct,\" and in sharp contrast\ntherefore to the vivid, concrete, and precise characters of\nthe others. Maury ^ makes the same comparison when he\nsaw a visionary view of Rotterdam with a clearness\nwhich he says he could never have attained by any volun-\ntary inward representation.

And all the more must\nthis be so when the seer is, as Miss Goodrich-Freer was,\na good crystal-gazer. But the advantage is not evident\nin the descriptions. There is a marked uniformity in them\nin respect of the point of distinctness, and some hypna-\ngogic subjects labour this in a way that suggests a super-\ndistinctness, as it were, a microscopic clearness of detail,\nwhich is characteristic of the visions and independent of\nthe native equipment for seeing. Thus S. M. B. says : \"I\nsee into the material without its being made coarser, as it\nwould appear through a magnifying glass \" ; and a corres-\npondent says of the definition of the faces : \"so sharp I\ncould see the grain of the skin.\" There is also no neces-\nsary connection between these and crystal visions, for some\nsubjects say that they have tried hard, or have frequently\ntried to see in the crystal without effect, and another\npercipient who is \" traiaed in minute observation \" \" never\nsees visions \" other than the hypnagogic variety.^ Prof.\nJames remarks^ that the \"pseudo-hallucinations\" \"differ\nfrom ordinary images of memory and fancy in being\nmuch more vivid, minute, detailed ...\" But if the good\nvisuahser is not better off as respects the quahty of his\nseeing, he is in another way, and that is by his ability to\ncompare and distinguish between the (apparently) different\nkinds of vision brought into play. A writer in the\nJournal * previously referred to, for instance, can place his\nimages of remembered known faces side by side with the\nstrange unknown ones, and says that the latter kind,\nwhich he calls his \" inward vision,\" is something quite\ndifferent. He sees both at the same time\u2014one in the\nbrain, the other in the eye. Another writer, in the\nSt. James's Gazette ^ distinguishes two effects as \"in the\niJowr.

[part\nbrain,\" that of voluntary visualisation, and that which\nresults from prolonged attention (which we may call the\nFlournoy type), but he maintains that the hypnagogic\neffects are distinctly neither of these.\nA certain confusion has arisen in the discussion of this\nsubject by the use of \" after-image \" in two different\nsenses. The true after-image is the sensation produced on\nthe retina by gazing at any brightly coloured object,\nwhich will then reproduce itself against a dull background\nin the natural, or complementary, colour, or both alter-\nnately, and is known as a \" positive \" or \" negative\n\"\nafter-image as the case may be. It is the unavoidable\nresult of all such seeing. But the spontaneous (not volun-\ntary) re-seeing of a scene, such as the student's Irish pro-\ncession on St. Patrick's Day, or Flournoy's chess-board, is\nnot the same thing. It may or may not be due to what\nProf. Alexander calls \" the hypnagogic agent,\" but it is\nnot due merely to such partial fatigue of the retina, as\nis universally experienced under given conditions. Myers'\n\" cerebral after-image \" is the more appropriate name for\nthese reproduced scenes, leaving the use of the positive and\nnegative after-image for the well-defined optical effect only.\nProf. Alexander does in fact distinguish them thus when he\nsays :\n\" they {i.e. hypnagogic visions) can be introspectively\ndistinguished in spatial quality from after-images, positive\nand negative, a fact which argues against their retinal\nlocus.\" 1\nIn Margaret Deland's account ^ she also remarks that\nthe hypnagogic images are not only \" strikingly different\nfrom any dehberate visuahsation \" but also from remem-\nbered things, which are as a rule motionless and complete,\nwhereas her visions display movement and are largely\nfragmentary, such as two fingers of a hand, half a face, a\nfoot moving across a threshold, and so on.\nThe question of visualisation connects with that extreme\nform of it which has been called projection. It is referred\nto as rare, but it is the ability to control which is so\n^Proc. Amer. S.P.R., Vol. III. p. 622. . ;\n^Jow.

They are Jerome Cardan\/\nGoethe,^ Blake, the artist known to Wigan,'^ and to these\nmay be added another patient of Wigan's, \" a very in-\ntelligent and amiable man who had the power of thus\nplacing before his eyes himself.^'' There are besides a case\ngiven by Dr. E. H. Clarke * of a man of scientific attain-\nments and careful intellectual training, who could produce\nvisions of statues by fixing his imagination strongly upon\nthe memory of what he had seen, or what had occurred\nto him as a good subject for groups ; a lady of Gurney's\nacquaintance who could \" evoke figures at any time by\nlooking intently before her \" ;\n^ and a group of cases given\nby Dr. Daniel Hack Tuke,^ of which the first is of Dr.\nLombard of Norwood. Baillarger contributes one example,\nMartia,' and Dr. Michea another.^\nWe note that in this group several reproduce only such\nthings as they have actually seen, and these are therefore\nin the nature of positive after-images. Thus Goethe sees\nagain the pictures which he had greatly admired ;\nWigan's\nartist sees the sitter whom he had attentively studied\n;\nDr. Lombard sees the girl's face and head which he had\nbeen gazing at, but transferred to a background of summer\nsea. All see with open eyes, and some in broad dayfight,\nand all are broad awake. They resemble hypnagogic visions,\nbut differ from them in several sahent particulars, of\nwhich the chief are the absence of drowsiness and darkness\n(except in Goethe's case), and the part played by conscious\nmemory and imagination. In this respect they more\nclosely approach our normal powers, and form a link for\n1 De Varietate Rerum, p. 314 (Basle 1557); lib. viii. c. 43, p. 410 (Ludg.).\n^ Goethe, Dichiung und Wahrheit, bk. viii.\n2 Wigan, Duality of the Mind, pp. 123-26.\n* Clarke, Visions, p. 216.\n^ Phantasms, vol. i. p. 492.\n^ Brain, vol. xi. p. 449, article on \" Hallucinations and the Subjective\nSensations of the Sane.\"\n' Mem. de I'Acad.

[part\nexamination between ordinary inward visualisation and the\nhjrpiiagogic images proper.\nThe investigation should not be very difficult, for though\nMiiller speaks of the rare power of projection of images at\nwill\/ and Dr. Clarke says \" few possess \" any such power,\n^\nyet Wigan says \" I have known numerous examples,\" ^\nand Dr. Lombard not only discovered his own powers but\nfound that they were equally possessed by the other persons\nwith whom he was in converse at the time. A correspon-\ndent of my own tells me that he had met at intervals three\nother men who could do the same thing, and the mention\nof it had arisen casually, none being particularly interested\nin the question. It may not be so uncommon, therefore,\nand affords some support to the tendency rather freely to\nattribute it to all who see apparitions, and are assumed to\n\" conjure up \" what they see, under some telepathic or\nother stimulus (as, for example, in Phantasms, i. p. 469,\nfootnote).\nThe evidence adduced in this division of the subject\nleads to the conclusion that hypnagogic visions are un-\naffected by either bad physical sight or poor visualisation,\nand that in those who suffer from neither deficiency there\nis agreement as to a certain difference of quality, inclining\nto marked superiority over the natural product of the\nbrain. - . .\nVII. Subject-Matter of the Visions. '\nIt is desirable at this point to attempt a closer study of\nthe visions themselves, in order to have ample data before\nreviewing the different theories brought forward to account\nfor them. At first sight they present in tlie mass a feast\nfor the imagination, in their almost endless variety, which\nmakes systematic examination difficult, but there is no\ndepartment of nature which does not offer this confusing\nand ramifying element, until by patiently pulling out strand\nby strand we get something like order into our ideas of it.\nThere seems in this case a kind of rough cleavage into\n1 Miiller, op. cit., p. 1397. = Clarke, op. cit., p. 216.\n^ Wigan, op. cit., p. 126.\n\fxciv.] Introductory Studij of Hypnagogic Phenomena 309\nspecies, beginning with the formless, continuing with faces,\nthen geometrical designs, objects, landscapes, and moving\nscenes, though there is no logical reason why we should\nnot take them in the opposite order and begin with those\nthat show the highest degree of reality and fullness of\ndefinition first. After the actual subject-matter comes the\nconsideration of shape, size, spatial relationship and peculi-\narities of view in various ways ; colour and illumination ;\nmultiphcity and internal movement ;\nrecognition or the\nabsence of it, in connection with the part that memory\nplays ; and finally the question of control, or relation to the\nwill. When all this has been considered, we are fairly\nat the threshold of the problem.\n(1) Formless.\u2014Most people, as has been remarked by\nseveral writers, suppose that when their eyes are closed,\nand particularly in the dark, they see nothing, but\nthis impression is due to the habitual and inconspicuous\nnature of the phenomena, and is an error. When pressed\nto- pay attention to it, they will find, according to Ladd,\nfor instance, that the darkness is a black wall with a\nmultitude of yellow spots. ^ Galton says that before he\nthought of carefully trying \" I should have emphatically\ndeclared that my field of vision in the dark was essentially\nof a uniform black, subject to an occasional Mght-purple\ncloudiness and other small variations. Now, however, . . .\nI have found out that this is by no means the case, but\nthat a kaleidoscopic change of patterns and forms is con-\ntinually going on.\" ^ Miiller refers to the \" fight which\nsometimes appears to the closed eyes at that time.\" ^\nMeyer, whose experiments on himself will be referred to\nlater, also speaks of pure colours without objects filling the\nentire field of vision.* Greenwood remarks that \" perhaps\nmany persons have noticed that when they lie with closed\neyes at night in a dark room, fight-charged clouds seem to\nfloat between eye and eyefid,\" and that the darkness in\n^ Ladd, G.

Barrett, who refers to the \" streams\nand patches of what seems to be a light flocculent matter\n\"\nwhich can be seen quickly moving on a dark purple back-\nground for half a minute or so, if a candle be suddenly\nlighted at night, and adds :\n\" It is possible that this pheno-\nmenon, which does not appear to be mentioned by any\nwriter on physiological optics, may be connected with the\npresence of the visual purple on the retina.\" ^ One of my\ncorrespondents also says :\n\" Once or twice, when wakened\nsuddenly, clouds of brilhant light seemed to roll and fade\naway before my closed eyes.\" Vairo ^ describes how,\nlying in bed with liis head and whole body covered, and\nevery sensation removed, he saw \" colores coeruleos, virides,\nrubros, albos, nigros, et quoscunque ...\" The seeing of\n\" wave after wave of purple \" and \" always seeing purple\n\"\nas well as the cloud and mist effects, and the \" dim mosaic\nof the dark,\" all mentioned by correspondents, shoM^ that\nwe have here the zero, so to speak, from which to start.\nThe cloud-effect is so constantly spoken of as preceding\nsome more definite picture that it seems to bear the sort\nof relation to it that the calyx does to the flower.

In one of the\nillustrations to Prof. Alexander's paper the flowers have\nfaces and expressions, and are putting out their tongues\nat the Puritan beside them. In Hawthorne's Journal for\nOctober 1851, he writes :\n\" Going to the village yesterday\nafternoon, I saw the face of a beautiful woman gazing at\nme from a cloud. It was the fuU face, not the bust. It\nhad a sort of mantle on the head, and a pleasant expres-\nsion of countenance. The vision lasted while I took a\nfew steps, and then vanished. I never before saw nearly\nso distinct a cloud-picture, or rather sculpture, for it came\nout in alto-relievo on the body of the cloud.\"\nA similar and marked tendency is described of himself\nby Dr. C. C. Carter in the Journal of the American S.P.R.,\nVol. XV. p. 351 (July 1921), and Mr. Stamton Moses'\nhand \" left to itself \" drew an extraordinary mass of faces\nonce, shown in Plate X. of A. W.

Poor Lelorgne de Savigny ^ used to\nwaken under a vast vault of contemptuous and spiteful\nfaces ; others have seen the stairs and the walls paved\nwith them. It is not surprising that considermg how\ngreat a part faces play in life, they should come into the\nhypnagogic gallery early and in large numbers. In the\nchildren's census, however, nearly twice as many speak of\nstars and colours as of people and faces.\nWe may note three characteristics of the faces as a\nwhole : the formation, the aesthetic quality, and the\nbehaviour.\n[a) As to the first, it has already been noted that they\nare the result of a process. In two of the best printed\ndescriptions, that by Greenwood and one by Mrs. Mac-\ndonald in Phantasms of the Living, the former says :\n^\n\" something which for one moment looks like a smoke-\nwreath or cloud-wreath takes form the next . . . there\n^ Ann.

[part\nbefore you is a face in the dark.\" The second narrator\nsays :\n^ \" They seem to come up out of the darkness, as a\nmist, and rapidly develop into sharp delineation, assuming\nroundness, vividness, and living reality.\" Another ^ has\nnot unfrequently observed them \" forming in the vague\nlight impressions which float before one's closed eyelids\nand mass together and turn into a face.\" Compare also\nMaury's account of his watching the passage of a luminous\nimage into a definite face of which it was possible to\nfollow the formation, during several seconds,^ and Lang's :\n\" I can, when half asleep, watch one of these specks or\nblotches growing in an infinitesimal space of time into a\nface, or other recognisable form of any sort.\" The frag-\nmentary nature of the faces has been noticed by several,\nnot only in fever as McNish's (p. 297), previously described,\nbut by such observers as Prof. Alexander and Margaret\nDeland. A correspondent speaks of one face forming\nthrough another, giving the effect of four eyes, on one\noccasion, although it seems a more usual experience for\none to fade away before another begins to come.\nThis is not the only way in which \" faces \" begin.\nThere is a second method, which might better be described\nas dehneation, and possibly it is more native to people of\nartistic gifts. Mrs. Alaric Watts in giving an account of\nthe beginning of her automatic drawing * refers to the\nvisions seen of human figures in outlines of white or grey\non a dark background. It is interesting and instructive\nto compare this with two other descriptions. One is\nGreenwood's :\n\" Though they seem living enough and not\nmere pictures or reflections, they look through the dark-\nness as though traced in chalks on a black ground . . .\nthe fines waver, fade, and return as if drawn with a pencil\nof phosphorus . . . but there is no phosphoric appearance\nabout them.\" We turn to Meyer's account of his\n1 Phantasms, i. p. 474. ^ Jour.

I can compare these drawings less to chalk\ndrawings on a blackboard than to drawings made with\nphosphorus on a dark wall at night.\" Miiller also speaks\nof the faces seen by children as \"in outline and devoid of\ncolour and light,\" ^ and a friend of the writer describes\nthe faces as always in intense black and white, with the\nvariation that the whole surface and not only the outhne\ny is bright ; that is, the face is white, the eyes and han\nbeing black. Thus also \" S. M. B.\" writes of some of her\nvisions that they were \" never coloured but in shadowy\nblack and white.\" Lang and others have mentioned cases\nof this \" blackboard \" type of hallucination. He speaks\nof printed letters black on white, and legible, so arising.\nApart from these two types, correspondents mention a\nvariety of other modes in which they have observed the\ninception of the faces. One of them, using the initials\n\"A. G. A.,\" whose account is to be found at length in\nLights says : \"A dim disc of light would suddenly appear\nand as suddenly brighten. There would be a whirUng\nmotion in the light which, with astonishing rapidity de-\nveloped into moving figures, which invariably came towards\nme.\" Another :\n\" They appear gradually, and are quite\nsilvery. . . . An eye will appear, then part of a face.\"\nA third says :\n\" They evolve out of a circle of either blue\nor green, which unfolds itself in a lovely golden centre, and\npass very rapidly. . . . Sometimes they are fragmentary,\nonly the teeth, eyes, chin or nose being seen.\" A fourth\nsays :\n\" The faces both come and go gradually, the eyes\nbeing generally the first to be observed, coming dimly as\nin a mist, till the whole face is clear and ahve, then will\nfade, the eyes watching to the last.\" A fifth : \"I can\nactually see the faces in process of forming. If I am too\nkeen (so it seems) there is a silent explosion.\"\n^ Quoted by James, Princ. of Psychol., ii. 66, from Meyer, G. H.,\nUntersuchungen ub. d. Physiol, d.

[part\nThis formative process is not invariably a matter of\nconscious observation, for sometimes the faces are said to\nbe \" flashed on and flashed out again \" suddenly, but it is\nevident that growth is a much more frequent experience.\nAnd it is confined to the \" faces \" ; we do not hear\nof any other objects or scenes appearing in a fragmen-\ntary way or building themselves up. A house, for\nexample, is a complete house, and does not show its\nchimneys or its windows first, and then add on the\nrest, forming itself out of cloud or showing in phos-\nphorescent lines.\n(&) Aesthetic Quality of the Faces.\u2014Perhaps this fact\nemphasises (if such an expression can be used of anything\nso obvious) the difference between the organic nature of\nthe faces and the \" still life \" of other things. A face is\nalwaj^s, in symbol, a person ; an expression of a thmking\nor feeling being. And the faces having \" come,\" by\nwhatever means, we now turn to ask what sort of faces\nare they ? The adjectives used, gathered from many\nsources, can be arranged in a sort of aesthetic spectrum.\nBut one quahty is common to the whole, and accompanies\nalmost all the others. That is the sense of reality,\nof life-likeness. We shall return to this in considering\nwhat I have called (for lack of a better word) their\nbehaviour.\nThe impression that prevails of predominant ughness in\nthe faces is not more correct than it would be to ascribe\nmoral goodness or badness to people in general. If we\ntake as a median fine or average, the expression used by\na correspondent, \" never very ugly or very beautiful,\" we\nshall find as many degrees above it as below it. This\nrefers to constant seers ; but if we include the general\nstatements about children who are hable to fears and\npersons in ill-health, whose visions are subject to degener-\nacy or otherwise obviously affected by it, there would then\nbe a majority for ugly faces.\nHere follow, then, a score of delineations which show\nthe range, those taken from published accounts being\nmingled with others privately received.

[part\nTo these must be added some outstanding descriptions,\nsuch as that of Mrs. Macdonald, akeady referred to,^ in\nwhich the feature of transition from the one extreme of\nthe scale to the other is more marked than in any other\ncase known to me. She says :\nFormerly the faces were wonderfully ugly. They were\nhuman, but resembling animals, yet such animals as have\nno fellows in the creation, diabolical-looking things. So\nciiriously and monstrously frightful were they that I cannot\nconceive whence they could have come if not from the\ninfernal world. I could not, certainly, at other times, by\nany voluntary effort of imagination, conjure up anything\neven remotely approaching their frightfulness. Latterly the\nfaces have become exquisitely beautiful. Forms and fea-\ntures of faultless perfection now succeed each other in\ninfinite variety and number.\nBeside this should be placed Greenwood's masterly\ndescription, almost unequalled in the Uterature of the\nsubject, of those \" strikingly distinctive \" faces in which\nhe discerned so much morally impressive significance. His\ncomparison of his visions of the \" awful family \" which\nvisited him, with Blake's \" wonderful, dreadful drawing,\n'\nThe Ghost of a Flea '\n\"\u2014an embodiment of blood-lust\nwhich none who have seen it will forget\u2014includes nothing\nto relieve their sombre sternness except a \" few, expressive\nof nobility and serenity,\" which were quite a minority.\nIt is difficult not to feel, as one studies this aspect,\nthat possibly the character of the faces has some relation\nto the dominant thought-tone of the persons seeing them,\nand may be a transcription in symbol of the unconscious\nmorality and instinctive emotional reaction to life which\nlies under the surface of the conscious and the controlled.\nThis is suggested also by the fact that in the children's\ncensus, where \" being pleased \" and \" being frightened\n\"\nwere the categories corresponding to our \" beautiful \" and\n\" hideous,\" 146 were \" pleased \" by \" people,\" of whom 17\nwere \" angels \" ; and of the 156 who were \" frightened \" hke-\n^ Phantasms, i. 474 (footnote).\n\fxciv.] Introductory Stvdy of Hypnagogic Phenomena 317\nwise, the number includes 27 \" ghosts \"\u2014whatever we are\nto understand by that. If we take visions of animals\nalone, only 18 children were pleased, as against 75 who\nwere frightened. Probably this large number represents\nand includes the frequently-mentioned \"grotesque\" animal-\nhuman or human-animal visions of the adult, who has more\nlanguage at command with which to distinguish his species.\n(c) The Behaviour of the Faces.\u2014Quite apart from the\nbeauty or ugliness of the faces, which is practically a fixed\nquahty which we need not stop to analyse now, is that\nwhich is strikingly often characterised as life-likeness. The\nfaces are sometimes only faintly coloured and would seem\nthen to approximate more to pictures ; but even in such\ncases the percipients specify that they have this living\neffect and are \" not mere pictures \"\n;\nthey have as a rule\nsolidity and colour. Even when the whole process is\nvisible, the \" fleecy white cloud \" or \" smoke-wreath \" of\nthe beginning ends in a result \" vivid and intense.\" ^ So\nalso the seer of the Brynhilda face previously referred to\nsays, \"generally extremely vivid\"; Margaret Deland says,\n\" always the feeling of life about them \" ;\n^ another goes\neven further, testifying that \" The faces I see are usually\nmore vivid than nature . . . absolutely full of life and move-\nment . . . always possess vividness of expression.\" It is a\nquality so frequently mentioned as to be evidently the\nnormal one ;\nonly one other witness therefore need be\ncited here\u2014Prof. Alexander's \" life-likeness and vividness\nof the visions,\" and their \" peculiarly vivid sensational\nfeel.\" 3 Where the face is \" flashed on and flashed off,\"\nand neither comes nor goes, this vital quality is naturally\nsignahsed, but in the case of growth there is the hint of\nan instant at which it begins to he.

Mr. Northcote Thomas, who saw the visions on one\noccasion only, saw nothing but eyes, \" a long procession\nof eyes\u2014lions' eyes, crocodiles' eyes, snakes' eyes, all\nsorts of eyes\u2014and that in a state of perfect health, so far\nas I could judge.\" ^ And another peculiarity of the faces\nunder consideration is that they are so often looking at\nthe percipient, as well as being looked at themselves. One\nwitness remarks that they not only \" seem very much\nalive \" but \" make '\nfaces ' at me \" !\n^ Among the\naccounts given by correspondents such phrases occur as\n:\n\" often seem to be looking closely at me,\" \" a bearded\nman appears, looks at me intently, grins horribly, and\nexplodes,\" \" a beautiful girl with large dark eyes peering\nat me most intently,\" \" looking directly at me,\" and so\non. This point has already been mentioned incidentally\nin other examples. In addition the lips sometimes move,\nor a hand is waved ; and one lady who invited the face,\nif it were real, to come nearer her, found that it did so,\n\" with an earnest expression,\" and adds the significant\nremark, \" the curious part is that since that night all the\nfaces float towards me and don't wait to be asked.\"\nA point remarked on by Prof. Alexander also receives\nfrequent illustration, and that is the tendency of the faces\nto express violent emotion.

Take, for an example of the latter, these two\nlittle scenes, the percipients being men. The first is from\na correspondent.\nAnother\u2014same night. A man appeared and hastened\nto the end of a long, white heavily-constructed table, and\nslammed his fist down on the top thereof, as if in anger,\nand disappeared. He was dressed in a sort of red jerkin.\nTime\u2014incredible speed, but most vivid.\nThe other is taken from A. G. A.'s interesting account in\nLight.^\nOut of the whirl of uncouth figures to which I was ac-\ncustomed, a big stout man, in a grey suit and Homburg\nhat, emerged, and came up (apparently) so close to me,\nstaring pointedly at me, that I expected him to touch me.\nThe movement and the figure were both so aggressive that\nI mentioned it to my family the next morning.\nThe following is a woman's vision :\n\u2014\nTwo faces that stand out particularly in my memory\nwere two jolly-looking middle-aged men in deep converse\n(profile to me). They suddenly became convulsed with\nlaughter. I could almost hear them. One of them, a grey-\nhaired man with grey moustache, opened his mouth so\nwide that I could see his teeth sideways, and his eyes went\nto slits with merriment.\n\" The last face I saw,\" writes Mr. rielding-Ould,^ \" was\nstrongly lighted and highly coloured, that of a laughing\nyoung man, turned half or three-quarters towards me.\"\n\" A delightful hob-goblin, swinging his legs and laughing\noutrageously,\" is a third, contributed by a correspondent.\nIt is evident that we cannot, nor need we try to, draw\nany hard and fast line between faces and figures, where\ngestures and actions carry out the same idea. The figures,\nas such, present themselves \"in all the changing scenes of\nlife,\" but in the examples now being dealt with their\nbusiness is more the expression of an emotion than any-\nthing else.\niFeb. 24th, 1923, p. 117.

[part\nFaces do not form an invariable element in the visions.\nSome who see nearly every other variety, including figures,\nmake an exception of the faces even of these ;\ne.g. Mrs.\nWillert in Phantasms says :\n^ \"I can never distinguish the\nfaces.\" Mrs. Arnold-Forster says :\n\" The pictures that I\nsee are seldom faces.\" ^ Prof. Herrick says :\n^ \" Sometimes\nthe images were of faces.\" And a lady who had deliber-\nately cultivated the seeing faculty for several years * testifies\nthat \" Faces do not come so easily, and vanish quickly.\"\nThe complete absence of faces, however, is not a common\nidiosyncrasy. Towards the latter part of his life Sir\nJohn Herschel, as already referred to, said ^ that he saw\n\" more faces and fewer landscapes,\" but \" the faces, which\nappeared in quick succession, were grey and colourless.\"\nWarcollier, though he places the faces of friends and\nstrangers first in his list, gives only instances of articles of\nfurniture, objects, plants, and flowers, which were especially\nfrequent with him, in actual illustration.^\n(3) Designs and Objects.\u2014If faces are the most frequent\nand living, geometrical designs are the most infrequent\nand the most completely antithetical to them of the\nvisions. The best account is that of Sir John Herschel,''\nwho has described the patterns \" of perfect symmetry and\ngeometrical regularity,\" both latticed, rhomboidal, and\ncircular, which he saw. Occasionally, but rarely, they were\ncomplex and coloured patterns like those of a carpet, but\nnot of any he remembered, and changing from instant to\ninstant. Another seer, a lady in whose family decorative\nengraving had been practised for several generations, gives\nthe following account of visions seen on awaking, but with\nthe eyes still closed.^ \"In a brilliant yellow light will\nappear the most beautiful decorative patterns, finials,\ncurves, spirals, leaves, blossoms, but aU black.\" Only two\n^ Vol. i. p. 474 (footnote). ^ Studies in Dreams, p. 162.\n^ Jour.

Lang once saw \" a very remarkable wall pattern in\ncrimson, which I could not, when wide awake, invent or\ndesign.\" The following are taken from the letters of\ncorrespondents. The first premises that her bedroom wall-\npaper is quite plain, the window screened with a green\nblind and heavily curtained, no patterned surface being\npresent even in the light. She sees with open eyes,\nusually on waking in the night, and writes in answer to an\nenquiry :\n\" Then the designs. Personally I should call\nthem conventional designs. You know the designs of\nfancy work, dress braiding, etc. Well, these designs appear\nlike a thin gauzy pattern hung through the room.\nBeautiful scrolls and twists. Two designs I remember\nquite well. One was a big wheel pattern, with scrolls\nbetween, and the wheels appeared as if they were studded\nwith coloured jewels. Another had a conventional rose\ndesign.\"\nA second correspondent writes :\n\" Another night ... I\nsaw my window outlined with a decoration of amber and\nblue stones, with blue nuggets swinging to and fro. This\nlasted about five minutes.\" On another occasion she saw,\nalso over the window, \" a swathe of red and yellow flowers\nin large round bud.\" My correspondent Lady Berkeley,\nwho kindly allows me to use her name, has favoured me\nwith an interesting collection of drawings in colour, made\nas soon as possible after the vanishing of the figures.\nThey are complex and brilliant in colouring, and most\ndifficult to describe in words. Many have spoken of then-\nattempts at reproducing their visions, so as to preserve a\nrecord of them, but I know at present of no one else who\nhas actually done so, and in colour. They possess, there-\nfore, a quite special interest in this connection.\nThe writer in the Occult Review, previously referred to,\ngives a very interesting description of patterned visions,\nwhich evidently constitute in this case a larger proportion\nthan is usual in the varied assortment. \" I see,\" she\n1 See Jour. S.P.R., Vol. IV. p. 278, and Vol. VIII. p. 158.\n\f322 F. E. Leaning [part\nwrites (I conclude the writer to be a woman, from the\nnature of the things seen), \" gorgeously coloured and\nwoven patterns or sometimes a plain material such as\ncorded silk, gathered and tucked and stitched in all sorts\nof ornamental devices. ... I saw some lovely lace a short\ntime ago of most elaborate pattern. As I watched it, it\nchanged gradually into a case full of pierced silver spoons\nand forks and other things of that kind. These in turn\nslowly became silver needlework, which then faded away.\"\nThis little series, of only nine cases in all, may be con-\ncluded by \" Goethe's rose,\" which he could see at pleasure\nupon closing his eyes. It was not, to be accurate, a rose\nso much as a conventional rosette, which continually put\nforth welUng petals from the centre. \" The same thing\noccurred,\" he says,^ \" when I figured to myself a varie-\ngated disk. The coloured figures upon it underwent con-\nstant changes . . . from the centre to the periphery, exactly\nlike the changes in the modern kaleidoscope.\" Miiller,\ncomparing notes with Goethe, decides that the differences\nin their respective seeing were proper to their respective\nmental endowments.\nThe lace, and silver needlework, of the vision quoted\nabove, form a natural transition to the seeing of objects,\neither singly or in multitude. But two points are to be\nnoticed about them : first, they appear as complete and\nnot fragmentary ; and secondly, there is no instance known\nto me of any distinct object being seen which was incom-\nprehensible in itself. They are things which can be named\nalways ; and to the best of my belief the same can be\nsaid of crystal visions. Not that there is a complete\ndearth of evidence that clairvoyants have occasionally\nseen objects which they could describe, but could not\nname or understand the use of, but it is rare.^ And it\ndoes not seem to occur in the hypnagogic visions, unless\nwe except those animals described as grotesque, so often.\n1 Goethe, Zur Morphologic und Wissenechaft, quoted by Miiller, op.\ncit., p. 1397.\n^ See on this point Dr. Wiltse'a sensitive and the piano, Proo.

They rarely act or move\nor express emotion. Sometimes only the head is seen,\nespecially if of a dog. One correspondent speaks of seeing\nthree heads of white Pomeranians withm a ckcle, two of\nwhich she recognised as friends. Another saw a shaggy\nchestnut pony with a white blaze advancing along a lane\ntowards her in a friendly way (the only vision of this sort\nshe ever had). A third writes of seeing a large black cat\nwith yeUow eyes, which she describes as \" a prussian,\" and\nthe same also saw a snake and a tiger at other times.\nMaury once saw a hon which he had travelled with in the\nEast many years before,^ and Dr. Clarke recalls with\npleasure the racing horses of his childhood, and that last\nremnant of the visionary power in manhood, when after\nan unusual dose of laudanum \" I have seen a horse's head,\nwith ears erect, peering at me through the darkness.\" ^\nOne who sees animals \" very often \" says they are \" more\nlike the monsters of fairy tales \" ^ ; a few others merely\nmention animals without further specifying them ; and Ladd\nquotes Miiller as seeing \" fantastic figures of men, animals,\nand what not, such as he never saw before.\" * Prof.\nAlexander has a gorilla's head in his list.\nA correspondent in South Africa, however, sends me\nthe following interesting example, partly to illustrate his\nimpression that \" in some mysterious way these so-caUed\nillusions possess an awareness of our presence, especially so\nin the case of animals. A short time ago,\" he continues,\nI was resting on the sofa after dinner, with my eyes\nshut in the full glare of the electric Hght, when a picture\nwas presented to me of a young cow, chestnut coloured,\nwith white points and wonderfully fine and symmetrical\nhorns. She seemed to be grazing in the full sunlight, on\nthe very luxm'iant grass growing on the bank of a railway\ncutting. At the top of the bank was a row of young\nhorse-chestnut trees. Behind the cow a small calf was\n1 Maury, op. cit., p. 68. 2 Clarke, E. H., Visions, p. 19.\n^Jour. S.P.B., Vol. VIII. p. 170.\n^Miiller, PJiantastische Oesichtserscheinungen, 1826.\n\f324 F. E. Leaning. [part\nstanding. The cow seemed to sense my presence, and un-\nmistakably adopted a protective attitude. Though I have\nbeen associated with cattle nearly all my life, I am quite\npositive I had never seen that cow before.\nAnother vision I had was that of a small species of\nduck unknown to me. The sun was shining on the green\nsheen of its neck, and it seemed to turn its head up\ntowards me with an intelligent expression of enquiry and\ninterest in its little black eye. By the power of will I was\nable to retain the picture for approximately two minutes,\nand all the time it appeared to me as though I might by\nstretching out grasp the duck in my hand.\nA better description than this is not to be found.\nBesides animals, there is a large majority of other\nobjects, houses, temples, rooms, interiors, furniture, trees, and\nso on, which would be tedious to enumerate. They are\nmingled with more complex scenes, and occasionally follow\nin classes or groups of simihar things, such as flowers,^ or\nas in the case of the Rev. George Henslow, illustrated by\nGalton,2 they may follow a \" cycle.\" Here single objects,\nthe arrow, star, and snowflake, led up to the \" weU-known\nrectory, fish-ponds, walls, etc., all covered with snow,\" the\nbed of red tulips in the brilliant sun of a spring morning,\nand so back to a single tulip, and finally the rather non-\ndescript other single objects of this set. A succession of\nunits, however, is far from being the rule, for the \" hyp-\nnagogic agent \" dehghts in an endless and multitudinous\nvariety. The main interest here does not He in the things\nseen, but in the conditions and quaUty of the seeing,\nwhich will be dealt with in the next section.\n(4) Landscapes.\u2014These form a very large class of the\nvisions of adults, and come midway between the inanimate\nand the much livelier scenes peopled with moving figures\nwhich will conclude the outline survey of the subject-\nmatter. Landscapes do not figure at all in the children's\ncensus. Next to people come \" things,\" then animals,\ncolours, and scenes, the latter quite in a minority. The\n^ See, for instance. Jour.

There is this\ndifference, however, that in the case of landscapes the\nclouds roll aside and have the effect of reveahng some-\nthing already there, as in the following description\nby a correspondent : \"I also see places, houses, moun-\ntains, and very often cloud formations, which break and\ngive a view of distant valleys or scenery in great bright-\nness.\" Compare also Mrs. Arnold-Forster :\n\" always as\nthough it were seen through a gap in a curtain of misty\ncloud, which is partly drawn aside \"\n(p. 163, op. cit.).\nAlmost the same description is given by a writer in Light :\n\" The last one {i.e. a scene) I remember was a bird's-eye\nview of a large city, viewed fi'om a higher point, seen as\nlying in a slack or a dip in the surface area, with out-\nstanding buildings of unusual construction in the centre.\nOn these buildings a bright light was moving hke a search-\nlight, causing them to be more illuminated than the others.\"\nThe landscapes are usually spoken of in terms of admira-\ntion :\n\" fine landscapes,\" ^ \" vivid and charming landscapes\nin natural colours,\" ^ \" highly picturesque and pleasing \" ^\n\" glorious,\" * \" architecture, landscapes, moving figures,\npass slowly by and sometimes remain, with incomparable\nclearness of form and fullness of being.\" ^ Stead's moonlit\nsea, and the cottage in the circle might be added {v. p.\n295 supra).\n(5) Scenes.\u2014If beauty characterises the landscapes, Hfe\nand movement in every variety are the chief features\nwhich distinguish the \" scenes \" from them. Sometimes we\nhave a Httle scene with a single figure : as of \"a stout\n^ Galton, op. cit., p. 164. ^ Herrick. ^ Herschel.\n*Jour. S.P.R., Vol. IV. p. 276. ^ Taine.\n\f326 F. E. Leaning.

At the moment he is putting on\nhis cap.^ Or there is a high stone wall ; at the foot of it\ntwo or three men in knee-breeches and lounge coats\n\" playing about,\" when one of them disappears at full\nspeed down the road. Neither the beginning nor the end\nof these tiny dramas is given. Scenes involving many\npeople, engaged in different activities, predominate. In\nsome the idea of the scene as a picture seems apparent,\nas in a lady's vision of a number of roofs and turrets of\nbuildings enclosed by a high wall. From a great gateway\nin this wall issued a throng of happy people, clad in gay\nclothes, and on the left was a long shady sun-flecked avenue\nof green trees. Or take this, from the correspondent who\nsaw the cow and the duck :\n\" Another pretty scene im-\npressed upon my memory was that of three young Kaffir\nwomen dressed in native costume. They were sitting on\nthe slope of a grassy hill rising out of a deep valley,\ntalking interestedly to one another whilst engaged in mak-\ning bead ornaments ; the glow of the setting sun was\nreflected by the dark bronze of their bodies. Below, in\nthe valley, now in the shade, the smoke from several\nkraals was rising through the mimosa trees, the whole forming\na delightful and natural picture, perfect in every detail.\"\nBut in many of the visions an ordinary but busy street-\nscene is sufficient, as in the following :\n^\n\" Another scene represented a street-scene in winter, the\nground covered with snow, a street-car with men standing\non the rear platform in heavy ulsters, the conductor\nassisting a lady to alight, pedestrians passing back and\nforth.\"\nIt is to be remarked that the scenes almost invainably\nportray the lighter and pleasanter aspects of life. They\nare hardly ever\u2014one might almost say never, of tragic or\niProc. Amer. S.P.R., Vol. III. p. 625. \u2022\n^Jour.

The officers were moving as they conversed and\npointed out places on the map ;\nthey had their backs to\nme, and I was panic-stricken lest they should turn and\nsee me. . . . This vision lasted for quite five minutes. I\ncould see it with my eyes open or closed. The room was\na large one with bosses of plasterwork at intervals on the\nwalls, and large windows down to the ground. I believed\nit to be a room in an old chateau in France.\"\nThe unity and intelligibihty of such scenes distinguish\nthem from those of delirium and insanity, and from the\nhallucinations of hysteria in which \" visions of animals,\npictures of corpses, phantastic processions in which dead\npersons, devils, and ghosts swarm.\" ^ Nicolai's Httle figures\nacted as in a marketing scene, and a similar and interest-\ning modern account exists which, though taking place in\nthe daytime and seen with open eyes, yet belongs to the\nsame order as the true hypnagogic visions. In this the\npercipient, an aged patient of the doctor reporting the\ncase, 2 though mentally exceedingly clear in every other\nrespect, would describe to him most vividly pictures of\nhosts of very Httle people, employing miniature wagons\nand horses about the work of hauhng timber and stone for\nbuilding operations. There were hundreds of them, and she\nwould enter into details about their dress and harnessing.\nVIII. Features of the Visions.\nA general view of the subject-matter of the hypnagogic\nhallucinations has rendered obvious the first and most\n^ An exception is referred to on p. 336.\n2 Jung, C.

[part\nconstantly mentioned point about them\u2014that is, their\nalmost boundless variety. It is unnecessary to emphasise\nthis point, for the study itself makes it quite unavoidable.\nThis variety varies very much in the proportion of its\nelements, some seeing many of one kind, others of another,\nand so on. Thus WarcoUier often sees flowers and objects,\nbut his friend, Mme. C, never sees either ; he never sees\nanything dramatic or sensational, but she sees pictures of\nminiature size of httle mediaeval personages, of beautiful\nbabies, young girls, and so on {op. cit., pp. 57, 67).\nBut while a comparison of many hsts will show, perhaps,\nindividual idiosyncrasies such as those mentioned, yet so\nlarge a body of common material also exists that the\nvisions admit, as we have seen, of being roughly classified\ninto groups.\n(1) Variety and Change.\u2014The fact of this variety has\nthe closest possible connection with the second point most\nfrequently mentioned, and indeed depends on it. This\nis change, without which obviously there could be no\nvariety. This is such a \" constant \" of the visions that\nits absence marks, probably, a particular experience as of\nanother tj^pe. In the first example, given above p. 295, the\ncottage in the circle, there was no change ; but in Stead's two\nvisions which follow it, there was as much contrast as was\npossible in so limited a number. Here and there are signs of\nsome underlying principle, such as is seen in a succession of\ndesigns, or of faces producing faces, or a following of a line of\nassociation, such as the Rev. George Henslow thought he\ntraced in his arrow, snowflake, snow scene and so on. Prof.\nAlexander has remarked :\n\" There is frequently a limited\nsequence of forms in what I may term the '\nhfe-history\n'\nof an individual image ; it undergoes transformation before\nthe eyes and in spite of any efforts I may make to pre-\nserve it unchanged.\" ^ Meyer gives a similar testimony :\n\" Some time after the pictures have arisen they vanish\nor change into others without my being able to prevent\nit.\" ^ Two frequently-quoted illustrations of this kind of\n1 Proc. Amer. S.P.R., Vol. III. p. 624.\n^ Meyer, G., quoted by James, op. cit., p. 67.\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 329\nsequential recurring vision are Greenwood's \" spangles and\nsheep \" case and Mrs. Haweis's roses and gold blocks.\n\" As I lay abed in the dark\" says the former,^ \"I used to\nsee a little cloud of bright golden sparks, which first\nbecame larger and more scintillating and then turned into\na flock of sheep rapidly running downhill into the general\ndarkness below. A few moments after the sheep had\ndisappeared the spangles would come forth again, and\nagain the transformation would ensue, and this would be\nrepeated a dozen times perhaps.\" Mrs. Haweis's experi-\nence was as follows. Both were the visions of childhood,\nhers being life -long, but diminishmg with years : \"It is a\nflight of pink roses floating in a mass from left to right,\nand this cloud or mass of roses is presently effaced by a\nflight of '\nsparks '\nor gold speckles across them. The\nsparks are Kke tiny blocks, half gold, half black, rather\nsymmetrically placed behind each other. . . . The roses . . .\nwould stay a long time before the sparks came, and they\noccupied a large area in black space. Then the sparks\ncame slowly flying, and generally, not always, effaced the\nroses at once, and every effort to retain the roses failed.\" -\nThese instances are hints of what may occur (Uke the\nrecurring dreams some people have), though recurrence is\nnot habitual and normal. In fact, Alexander says : \"if\nthere be such a thing as irrelevance, these images show it.\"\nBut this is a point on which there is but a very small\ngroup of studies or records to help us ; the general im-\npression one gets is that incoherence and the absence of\nassociation rather prevails. This will be considered further\nunder experiments in control (Sec. XII.).\n(2) Duration and Speed.\u2014The rate of change and the\nlength of time for which a picture wiU remain to please\nthe beholder are matters on which we have a little more\nevidence. Change there must be : no picture can be\n\" held \" indeflnitely, and as a rule no picture ever appears\ntwice. The exceptions are the result of effort and inten-\ntion ; and occasionally, as we have just seen, the result of\nsome cause still obscure to us, but are not in the nature\n1 Greenwood, op. cit., p. 16. \" Galton, op. cit., p. 165.\n\f330 F. E. Leaning. [part\nof the visions themselves. There is a diversity of experi-\nence as to their duration. The drowsy-time for normal\npeople is itself brief ;\nthey are courting sleep and not\ntaking note of the time, and the time itself is \" rounded\nby a sleep \" ;\nonly in the case of conditions prevailing\nthat prevent sleep is there any prolongation of this period.\nThe visions do not begin immediately on the closing of\nthe eyes, but, when a certain half-consciousness is reached,\nsoon after. But there is undeniably a connection between\nthe rate of change and the condition of the circulation in\nthe brain. Fatigue, anxiety, excitement, cerebral agitation,\nreflect themselves readily in the speed with which the\nvisions come and go. A case which may be regarded as\na maximum, though produced by a drug, is given by\nProf. James. ^ The experimenter, mth a pulse at 135 beats\na minute, saw a vast variety of whirling images, \" a thou-\nsand different objects in ten minutes \"\u2014hands, spoons,\nwheels, tin soldiers, lamp-posts, etc. Maury's crowding\nimages, after his two days at Greek, have already been\nreferred to. Miiller refers to the \" rapidly changing\nforms \" ; Henslow says the \" extreme restlessness \" of his\nvisual objects, oscillating and rotating, and changing\ncharacter made examination almost impossible ; Mrs. Mac-\ndonald speaks of the \" surprising rapidity \" and infinite\nvariety and number of her images. Whether all these\npercipients were m a state of excitement all the time we\ncan only surmise : it does not seem Hkely. But the few\nwhose seeing was confined to a few days in a lifetime were\nfeverish or over-tired at the time, and yet the number of visions\nseen by these people was as great as the number seen by\nother percipients during much more prolonged periods.\nIf we find these at one end of the scale, we find at the\nother those whose pictures do not hasten away. Mrs.\nHaweis says that her gold blocks came slowly flying, after\nthe roses had floated by for some time. The lady of the\nlace and silver needlework also says they change slowly.\nIt is noticeable that Taine ^ speaks of the images becoming\nsteady and lasting, passing slowly by and sometimes re-\n1 James, Princ. oj Psychol., ii. 121.

This curious movement across the field of vision\nseems an alternative to the fading out and re-manifesting,\nor the actual change of form while being looked at. It\ntakes place sometimes from left to right, as with Mrs.\nHaweis and Herschel, but sometimes in the opposite direc-\ntion, as with Cardan, \" moving in a circular direction,\nupwards, from right to left, slowly \" ;\n^ and in a case given\nby Hyslop ^ where the subject, waking in the night, sees\non his bedroom wall \" wonderful moving sceneries, valleys,\nlakes, mountains, etc. What impresses me so, \" he adds,\n\" is the great quickness of movement ; but I can take in\nall details, and the movement is from right to left,\ngoes away from me.\"\nIt may be mentioned that of these four examples only\nthe first is hypnagogic ; Herschel's was a day-vision (at the\nbreakfast table), ^ and the other two are hypnopompic. So\nis the following, in which \" Invariably the pictures are a\nmoving landscape . . . exactly as if seen from a train, etc.,\nforeground swiftly, background slowly. The swift left to\nright moving panorama of ordinary agricultural land, with\ncottages, etc., the motion stopping gradually as it faded.\"\nThis instance, communicated first in 1922 ^ by M. Gheury\nde Bray, has since been followed up by a very curious\nmodification in which two architectural series moving with\nextreme rapidity in converging directions were seen, an\nobfique line of division separating them.\n(3) Shape and Scale.\u2014TlievQ is a peculiarity connected\nwith the visions which is to be noticed here, and that is\nthe tendency to take a circular form.

Dr. Mary Scharlieb in Change of Life, p. 28, says\nthat women may see \" the battlements of a fortress \" as an hallucination\naccompanying attacks of headache ; and it is significant that a lady\nfriend of Herschel's often saw this appearance and suffered from head-\nache, neither of them evidently knowing that it was a symptom of dis-\nturbance at the menopause.\n* See Jour. S.P.R., Vol. XX. p. 250, and Vol. XXI. p. 71.\n\f332 F. E. Leaning. [part\nalready been given, in which the picture is seen within a\ncircle. In the case of the \" cottage in a circle \" first\nquoted\/ the spectator says the light \" assumed the form\nof a circle two or three yards in diameter,\" but in Stead's\n\" moonlit sea \" it was \" a living miniature about the size\nof a magic lantern slide.\" So also Mrs. Willert says \" they\nseem to be very much like the constantly changing slides\nof a magic lantern, and I should say of the same size.\" ^\nWhen Bostock speaks of the human faces or figures on a\nsmall scale which he saw during his attack of fever, he\nnotes that \" they were all of the same size and appeared to\nbe all situated at the same distance from the face.\" They\n\" were gradually removed like a succession of medaUions.\"\nThis expression is not used by chance, for such words as\n\" cameo \" and \" medalhon \" often occur in verbal and\nother accounts of the present day. An analogous example\nis that of Dr. Gibotteau's vision in the night of a round\nluminous tract on the wall of his bedroom, in the midst\nof which appeared a brilliant object which he did not\nrecognise, but which was a lantern. This was the result\nof Nurse Berthe's experiment in impressing him from a\ndistance, but he remarks that \" that part of the room was\nilluminated as it would have been by a powerful lamp.\" ^\nProf. Gruber's subject, who illustrates coloured audition,\nor \" chromatisms \" for certain words in the form of\npatches of light, also had them as circles capable of\ndefinite measurement ; and Mr. F. Gottschalk saw the\nvision of two hands opening an envelope within a circle\n{Phantasms, ii. 31 and 34, where other instances are\ngiven). \" C. B. M.\" * gives a graphic description of the\n\" globe pictures \" which she saw, of busy scenes, both by\nnight and day.

Unless Cardano's visions were also of this\nsort, as the rather obscure Latin seems to imply, this ease is unique.\nThe scenes seem to be within a sphere, but transparent, like a soap-\nbubble.\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 333\nframed picture \" used by one or two percipients, and re-\nported of Nicolai also, is to be taken as implying definite\nenclosing lines and angles, and that of the panel scene of\nthe three officers given on p. 327 is unusual in this respect.\nGoethe's pictures were projected memories of things actu-\nally seen, but his visionary flower, often called a rose\nbecause of its red petals and green leaves, was round. In\nthe series of coloured sketches made by Lady Berkeley,\nalready referred to (seep. 321) of her own visions, there is\na great variety of designs, but except the well-known\nsymbol of the double triangles, few rectangular ones.\n\" Curved is the line of beauty.\"\nIt is in variations of size that another peculiarity is\nmet with. McNish draws attention to it, giving examples\nfrom various sources, of how one saw \" entire human\nfigures, but they were always as minute as pins or even\npin heads \" ; and with another, \" Colossal figures are her\nfrequent visiters (sic).\" ^ These are from cases of illness, but\nthey can be matched among the hypnagogic images of the\nhealthy. And it is a more frequent feature to meet with\nminiature pictures than with those of a larger scale than\nnature. Nicolai's phantoms were half the natural size ;\nMaury's were at first always \" petites,'' but as years\npassed on they became larger, and nearly life-size, while\nlandscapes were reduced almost to miniatures.^ Prof.\nAlexander remarks that \" all such images seem small \" ;\nthe writer in the Occult Review says : \"At other times I see\nbeautiful little clear living pictures, with tiny people\ngenerally occupied about the most ordinary incidents of\neveryday life.\" A correspondent describes among her\nvisions \" tiny gardens, complete with terraces, vases,\nstone walls, etc.\" Another says \" mostly small, very vivid\npictures, like those seen in the '\nfinder '\nof a camera.\"\n1 McNish, op. cit., p. 267.

[PABT\nSeveral observers have come to the conchision that there\nis a radical difference between these perfect \" ready-made \"\nlittle scenes and some other of their visions, particularly\nfaces. It is therefore in place here to consider next what\nmight be called\n(4) The Point of View.\u2014-The spectator is conscious of a\nconsiderable range in the apparent distance of his visions,\nand this does not seem to be entirely based on the un-\nconscious mental interpretation which we give to objects\nof known size, when they appear larger or smaller accord-\ning to their distance from us. The miniatures spoken of\nare not taken to be very far off because they are small\n;\nthey are sometimes stated to be at a distance of only a\nfoot or two. They lose nothing in distinctness, however\nsmall the scale, but seem like a landscape close at hand\nseen through an artist's \" diminishing glass.\" With figures\nalso, one narrator speaks of them as carte-de-visite size,\nfull-length, and faces only as cabinet vignette, but\nnow and then life-size.^ Another says (of faces),\n\" life-size and very close to my eyes.\" ^ Galton's friend\nspeaks of the waking visions as \" quite close, filling, as it\nwere, the whole head.\" ^ They appear and vanish in an\ninstant. His relative also, especially when not well,\nfound them \" almost suffocatingly close.\" Greenwood's\nwonderful faces, however, were five or six feet off, but his\nsheep and spangles within his closed eyehds. A corres-\npondent also says something illuminating about his images,\nwhich I do not find so clearly expressed anywhere else.\nAfter describing a \" perfectly round, intensely bright yellow\nlight, precisely (so I thought) the same diameter as the\niris \" which \" floated within my closed vision exactly as\nsome of the vague '\nfaces in the dark,' \" he adds \" the\nmere faces apparently float withui the scope of the eye\nitself. The eye is not looking out at them\u2014they are within\nit. But the '\nscenic elusions '\nappear to be of a higher\ntype, for these are clear, real and without boundary. The\neye is looking out at them.\" But when, as in Mr. Field-\n1 Jour. S.P.R., Vol. VIII. p. 295. ^ jour. S.P.R., Vol. VIII. p. 269.\n2 Galton, op. cit., pp. 164, 166. \u2022..\n^\n\fxciv.] Introductory Stvdy of Hypnagogic Phenomena 335\ning-Ould's description,^ he speaks of the faces being \" ap-\nparently about two feet away from the eye \" and bursting\ninto view, complete in every way, we have an example of\nsomething which the eye does \" look out at \" ; if it be the\neye which is concerned. This is getting into the region of\ntheory, which is pi'emature, but if differing theories are to\nbe fairly dealt with, all the data alike miist be considered,\nand the impressions of those whose evidence is at first\nhand are entitled to be heard.\nThe last-named witness, in his account, draws attention\nto yet another peculiar feature of the \" point of view.\" It\nis not only the detail, in itself, but the kind of detail\nwhich would not normally be observed at all. \" The\n'\nlandscapes,' \" he remarks, \" may be merely a stretch of\nroad on which every pebble is distinct even to obtrusive-\nness.\" A correspondent further illustrates this, and en-\nlarges on it :\n\" One such picture was the edge of a stretch\nof turf bordering a gravel walk. The turf edge, about four\ninches deep, was exactly on the level of the vision,\nevery rootlet and grain of soil sharply defined. To see it\nactually so, one would have had to lie very flat on the\ngravel walk, with one's face close to the turf. Again, I\nhave seen, at very close range, stone mouldings and\ncrockets of some church tower, high up on that church\ntower, and noted the design and sharp lights and\nshadows before the whole picture was gone.\" Again, I\nhave had described to me as a thing seen a section\nthrough earth, sea, and air, the sm-face of the sea with\nships on it, then a wall of waters, and then the earth's\nglobe, like an orange cut down. M. Gheury de Bray's\nexperience of seeing the landscape as from an aeroplane,\nthough not a reminiscence of any such actual event,\nis somewhat similar to this. And Warcolher has a\nvariant of his own, for he says : \"I have observed that\nthey frequently have the appearance of being localised in\none of the two eyes.\" In an instance of a vision (of his\ndining-room table with the cloth thrown back, a cup and\nsaucer, etc.) he saw it small but very clear with the left\n1 Ught, Feb. 24, 1923, p. 122.\ny\n\f336 F. E. Leaning. [part\neye, whilst an image (he does not say whether the same\nor not) dimly (\" sans nettete \") appeared in the right eye\n(p. 58).\nThere is finally an experience, exceedingly rare in the\nannals of Psychical Research, which has twice been men-\ntioned to me by correspondents. It is that of seeing with,\nor from, the back of the head. Thus one says :\n\" One\nor two have been at the back of my head, but I see them\nquite distinctly \" ; the other uses almost the same words :\n\" as if my eyes were at the back of my head.\"\n(5) Illumination.\u2014One of the very commonest features of\nthe visions, which, in fact, cannot be missed by anyone\nwho reads or hears of even a few, is the diffusion of\nbright light in which everything is seen. Mr. Henslow's\nbed of red tulips in a \" spring morning, briUiant sun,\" for\ninstance, or Myers' \" wet hedge in the sun,\" ^ the sohtary\nexample he has given us, are illustrations. It is almost\nalways sunlight that is mentioned ; Stead's is the only\nmoonlight picture I have met with, and that possesses a\nfeature which in itself gives its kinship to the rest. (Ex-\namples of scenes in evening Hght are to be found on pp.\n326 and 338, the Kaffir women and the Indian soldier\nvisions.)\nAn extraordinarily sombre vision is given in Light,^ in\nwhich a scene of a darkly-garbed woman in a dimly\nlighted room, stabbed by a man also in antique dress,\nforms an exception to the rule. Even in this the woman's\nwhite stomacher, and the flash of the man's weapon,\nbrings out the \" bright point \" ; but see the companion\nvision (the desert scene) as quoted on p. 340 infra, which\nis a complete contrast. It is possible that the vividness\nand the clearness, which most narrators lay so much stress\non, are due to this diffusion of light, though careful reading\nshows them not to be wholly so ; the distinctness is the result\nof a penetrative quality in the seeing, apparently, which\nthe strongest light would not quite account for.\nNext to the prevalence of an illuminated field of view\ncomes that of objects which are of native brilliance, such\n^ Proc. S.P.R., Vol. VIII. p. 370. ^ Light, 1920, p. 112.\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 337\nas gold, silver, diamonds, all things that sparkle and\ngleam. If Myers' hedge had not been ivet, with dew or\nrain-drops, it would have lost the suggestion of a glittering\ngreenness. Mr. Henslow's dynasty of bright objects,\n\" frequently of great beauty and highly brilliant,\" included\ncut glass, and highly chased gold and silver fihgree orna-\nments ;\nMeyer's silver stirrup was so vivid as to leave an\nafter-image ;\n^ the gold blocks that effaced the roses, and\nthe spangles that turned to sheep, are the least \" of that\nbright band,\" unless the sparkhng and rippluag of waves\nshould be given that place. Where the brilliancy fails\nof actual flame or flash, it is there as some element of\nwhiteness\u2014a white patch of snow on the emerald moor-\nland, ^ the white collar of an Eton boy gazing across his\ndesk, the gleaming of the eye in Stead's second vision, the\nclothes hanging on the line, the man advancing to a white\ntable, and so on. According to C. S. Myers,^ \" Any colour\nstimulus, if sufficiently intense, is seen as white. In-\ntense spectral reds and orange, and greens up to a wave-\nlength of 517 mUKonth parts of a millimetre, acquire a\nyellow hue before they in this way become colourless.\"\nBut this would not account for the white patches being\nalways in the right place.\n(6) Colour.\u2014If the hjrpnagogic agent is an artist, whose\nfirst law is \" Let there be Kght,\" the second is that in\nthat hght there shall be living coloiir. If we begin with\nthose outlines of white on black, and the sometimes very\nfaintly coloured faces, such as Greenwood's, which depend\non form primarily for their significance, there would appear\nto be a strange gap between them and the completely\ncoloured visions. It is not nature's way to omit grada-\ntions, and yet evidence was lacking of an intermediate\nclass until a lady in Edinburgh supphed an interesting\nexample.

They were nearly all of lofty stone walls with\nhttle windows and loop-holes ; the outer side of dock-sheds ;\na stone face of a woman lying in waste ground ; ruined\nchurches, chiefly doors ; and one, the only recognisable\none, of the outside of the smaller caves of Ellora, those\nwonderful cave temples of the Deccan, India. I had\noften visited the larger ones, but only seen these at a\ndistance. All these were clear, without colour. The last\nI can remember was on a larger scale, as though taken\nfrom the top of an Eastern Fort gateway\u2014a group of\nmounted soldiers in tin helmets waiting admittance, while\ndown a slope at the foot of which a pool, shaped like a\nstar full of reflected light as of sunset, lay, and up on an\neminence was another group of similar soldiers waiting.\"\nIn a second letter, in reply to enquiries, she says again\nthat the pictures were as \" little photo prints, good prints\nfrom perfect negatives, except in the case of the soldiers,\nwhen it appeared as if the light had been bad for the\nexposure\u2014evening light, I should say, after a wet day. . . .\nNone was of the nature of a sketch at aU.\" On the\nsecond night, Feb. 4-5, she again saw small distinct\npictures, but coloured this time, \" soft in outhne, exquisite\nin colour, and also miniature in size.\" Among them were\n\" beautiful caverns, snow-white, opening to a sky with\nstars ; sometimes the cavern would be dark, opening to a\nlovely calm sea, with an island or land beyond.

The uncoloured visions lasted for six\nmonths.\nWe find in the \" brilliant colours \" the characteristic note\nof the awakening to colour in every variety, which we\nexpect to find in the visions. So many have remarked on\nthis that there is no doubt it is the normal thing, not\nonly to see all things in their natural colours, but to see\nthem in the highest degree of vividness, and in fact sur-\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 339\npassing in their richness and glow the facts of visual\nexperience.

[part\n\" like an elixir.\" ^ But every element in the rainbow\nconies into play, although perhaps with certain individuals\ncertain colours predominate. Maury seems to have fre-\nquently seen a blue or bluish light, and on one occasion it\ndeveloped into the vista of a lighted street in a town under\nthe shadowy blue of night skies. ^ He even saw blue in the\ncheeks of his figures, and the women of his later years\nwore sombre garments. But occasionally, as on the\njourney into Switzerland by coach, he saw a crowd of\nbrilhant Httle personages in scarlet, chattering and moving\nincessantly. It is obvious that since colour plays so large\na part in the visions, and they are not confined to such\nthings as can be any colour at choice, such as carpets and\nclothes, that the subjects of them must be often the result of\nselection on the part of the producing agency. That is,\nthey must consist of articles or scenes in which colour is\nan inevitable and prominent feature. Prof. Alexander\nmentions, for instance, among a list of over a dozen, a\nbunch of red berries amid green leaves, a striped necktie,\nand so on. Warcolher, during an experiment with phos-\nphorescent glasses, saw a flame-coloured nasturtium with\ngreen leaves. A correspondent sends me the following,\nwhich well illustrates the pomt : \"a cock in brilhant\nplumage in full sunshine, flapped his wings, neck out-\nstretched and curved, as in crowing.\" It may be noted\nin connection with this that cerebral after-images of\nscenes witnessed during the day, such as the manoeuvres\nof scarlet-coated soldiers in a park, or the student's pro-\ncession of St. Patrick, are also of a highly-coloured kind\nand seen in the sunshine.\nBy permission of the editor of Light I take the follow-\ning beautiful scene ^ which, except for the absence of\nchange, is typical of the sun-hghted visions.

All are not affected to the\nsame degree, and still less in the same way ; and it is\ndifficult to determine whether the diversity lies in indi-\nvidual tastes or in the quality of the visions themselves.\nIt would seem rather as though there were a more or less\nconstant element at work in the presentation, and a more\nor less capricious temper in the audience. According to\nDr. Walsh, ui most adults the little stage displays \" are\nunnoticed or excite no particular interest \" ;\n^ and in sup-\nport of this may be cited Prof. Alexander, who says :\n\" my\nown state at the time is almost untinged by feehng\n\u2014\nperhaps a languid interest in watching the images, or\namusement at their absurdities. Doubtless the interest\ntends to prolong the hypnagogic period and so multiply\nthe number of the images, but it does not affect their\ncharacter.\" ^ Even Mrs. Arnold-Forster, who begins by\nsajdng \"Of all our borderland experiences perhaps none\nare more attractive,\" ends by saying that \" no special\ninterest attaches to them, and apart from moments of\npleasure that they give us, they might not be worth even\na passing reference.\"\nAs an intellectual verdict pronounced by these authori-\nties, two of whom at least speak with first-hand knowledge,\nthis would seem to dispose of the matter at a low rating.\nBut yet it is not one in which the majority of our wit-\nnesses agree.

As lias been pre-\nviously remarked, children are often frightened as well as\npleased, in almost equal proportions as regards their\nnumbers, judging by the children's census, though the\npopular idea is that they are much more frequently\nfrightened. Havelock Ellis, citing the French author E.\nGuyon,^ says \" he believes that childi'en always find them\nterrifjdng,\" and comments \" That, however, is far from\nbeing the case.\" When we consider what various authors\nhave told us about their sufferings as children, even\nwithout any hypnagogic visions, it is surprising that fear\nis not more universal than it is. See, for example, the\nyoung Richter's story of the terrible two hours that\nalways elapsed between his own bedtime and the coming\nof his father ^\n; Charles Lamb's Witches and Other Night\nFears ; and J. A. Symonds' really pitiable ordeals of the\nsame sort,^ as he feelingly relates them. Nor is fear\nconfined to children. Maury's old servant kept her light\nburning as a preventive of \" les vilaines figures,\" and the\npatient cited by McNish was \" tortured \" by her visions.\nAll who describe their images in such forcible terms as\n\" hideous,\" \" monstrous,\" etc., if not frightened, are dis-\ntressed and disturbed by them. This, then, is one of the\nemotional effects produced.\nAnother which is less frequently mentioned, but evi-\ndently does occur, is that of surprise, a remarkable thing\nif we consider it. The appearance of the pictures, accord-\ning to Mrs. Arnold-Forster, \" is always rather a surprise,\nand I am totally unable to guess when or in what form\nthey will come, or what the '\npicture on the screen ' will\nchange into.\" ^ So also the lady who saw the \" cottage\nin the circle \" was \" very much surprised and interested\n\"\n(see p. 295 supra).

Thus Mrs. Deland mentions \" much interest\nand amusement \" derived from the faces and scenes ;\n^\na doctor is \" much interested and entertained \" by the\npanorama, \" entirely outside of (his) mental action \" ;\n^\nGreenwood after many years stUl found the faces \" very\ninterestmg indeed \" ; Herrick received \" great pleasure\n\"\nin his childhood (as did Dr. Clarke), and in later years\nrehef from insomnia ;\n* and if we add to these the enjoy-\nment and admiration imphed in the terms used in speaking\nof landscapes, etc., (see Section VII.), the fact that such men\nas Greenwood could say \" no words and no skill in using\nthem can describe an intensity of meaning which is\nsometimes too vivid, too invading, too terribly convincing\nto be borne \" ; or again, Dr. Weir Mitchell :\n\" I find it\nhopeless to describe in language, the beauty and splendour\nof what I saw,\" it is evident that the experience runs up\nfar beyond what we can call interesting, even at its highest.\nIn the case of the last writer referred to, he says that he\nwas \" critically attentive, interested, and curious,\" and it\nmay be noted that curiosity is another emotion produced\nby the visions. It leads often to attempts to control,\nwhich wiU be considered in the proper place (see\nSection XII.).\nIX. Companion Phenomena.\nAlthough hitherto only visual hypnagogic hallucinations\nhave been considered, the study is not complete without\ntaking into account those other sensory forms which occur\n1 James, op. cit., ii. 117.

These are\nimpressions of hearing, smell, and sensation, in the order\nof their frequency, or perhaps it would be safer to say,\nin the order of their frequency of mention. There is a\nmuch smaller mass of data available for this further\nstudy, but enough to show that a parallelism exists. An\nanalysis of Baillarger's thirty cases, ^ which formed his\nown origmal contribution to the study of the then un-\nnamed \" etat intermediaire a la veille et au sommeil,\"\nshows that ten subjects both saw and heard, while fifteen\nin all saw and twenty-two heard, two smelt, and five\nexperienced hallucinations of touch. The sexes were ten\nmen, eighteen women, and two not specified. If this\ntable were any indication, it would certainly point to\ncases of hearing, either alone or in conjunction with other\nsensory hallucinations, being quite in the majority. But\nit cannot be altogether considered as on the same footing\nwith the experiences of the sane ; for persons who were\nsane all their lives never became patients for a longer\nor shorter time at the Salpetriere. Those who were\ntemporarily there, owing to shock (as of a workwoman, who\nwitnessed a murder) and others who began by having\nhypnagogic visions for two or three years, and then\nsuddenly developed continuous or periodical hallucinations,\nare instructive, because they form the link between the\nquite sane typical hypnagogist and the quite insane\n\" hallucine.\" One old employe, who was not a patient,\ngives his own account, and it resembles the ordinary\nexperiences in every point. It included voices as weU\nas visions.\n(1) Hypnagogic Sounds.\u2014The question of auditory pheno-\nmena has been discussed by Prof. Alexander, ^ and by\nanother author ^ who says his imagination is of the\nauditory type. \" Last night,\" he relates, under date\nNovember 3, 1914, \"I saw several persons standing\nclose together and heard them talking.

Have-\nlock Ellis relates that \" It has occasionally happened to\nme that as I have begun to lose waking consciousness,\na procession of images has drifted before my vision, and\nsuddenly one of the figures I see has spoken,\" and he\nwas thereby startled into complete wakefulness.^ It is\nnot proposed to attempt anything like a complete outline\nof this part of the subject, partly because it is too large\nand merges into the general study of auditory hallucina-\ntions as a whole. IVIr. J. Barker Smith has given ample\nmaterial out of his own experience for an analytical study\nof voices, 2 though it would be necessary to distinguish\nthe hypnagogic from his other instances. The impression\nconveyed is that there is something about them which\ncorresponds to the colour, perspective, etc., of the visual\nimages, and probably with sufficient data we might find\nevery point paralleled. In the meantime I will only add\nhere two examples from correspondents, which are more\nclear-cut and mteresting than the foregoing, as com-\nbining vision and voice. The first is from a professional\nman, who, though often seeing, found this a \" unique\n\"\nvision. He writes :\n\" There was quite a company of\npeople about me, young women I beheve, who looked\ntowards me and passed on. One of them spoke. I heard\nthe voice distinctly, soft and clear. It said '\nHe isn't\nasleep.' That is aU . . . I am certain I am not confusing\nthis with a dream.\" He had previously said that he\nwas prompted to turn up the fight and make a note of\nthis, but as the night was cold, and a keen wind blowing\nthrough the open window, he did not. The account was\nwritten a few days later. The second is from a lady\nwho sent me the description within a few hours of the\noccurrence. It took place after a period of wakefulness\nin the night, when she had just closed her eyes with\nthe desire to sleep.\n1 Ellis, op. cit., p. 33.\n* See his series of 17 articles on Clairaudience in the General Prac-\ntitioner, May 26-Sept. 22, 1900, and Medical Times, 1920-1923 (April).\n\f346 F. E. Leaning. [part\nImmediately on doing so the bows of a ship appeared\non the left hand side of the bed. A rather blurred light\nfastened on the extreme point in front, under the ])ow-\nsprit, lit the vessel up and made her look white, though I\nthought she might not liave been. It was like moonlight.\nShe cut through the water, making little waves that broke\ninto foam. Twice the picture came, but only for a second\nor two, and only the fore-part of the ship. I said it was\nnot so strange, as a friend had left a few days before for\na long voyage, and others were arriving, when quite clearly\nand authoritatively a voice spoke on my right a little be-\nhind my pillows :\n\" There's no occasion to warn her.\nWe've got one ship olf already.\" It was the voice of a\nworking man of the better class. \u2022\nThese cases are in interesting contrast with a small\nnumber which powerfully suggest sound, though sound\nthere comes none. For example, the lips that move as\nthough forming a word, the crowing cock, Cardano's\ntrumpeters marching with trumpets, as it were, in full\nblast but soundlessly, the laughing men, and so on.\nA curious but marked limitation of some sort is manifested\nhere. Those who combine the auditory power with the visual\nhave a richer content in their experiences, though Lelorgne\ncould have well dispensed with the vast chanting choruses\nwhich tormented him.\nWith .\nregard to music being heard in the hypnagogic\nperiod, this is rarer than voices. Lady Berkeley mentions\nthe hearing of splendid organ music occasionally. Her\naccount is as follows, and presents several points of\ninterest :\nI not infrequently hear bells (or something like bells)\nmostly at night, and have often got out of bed, opened all\nwindows, etc., to ascertain whether they really were ring-\ning, only to be met by complete silence outside. (We live\non a hill, in extensive grounds and dominate the town of\nNice, having no near neighbours.) On returning to bed,\nputting balls of wax in the ears and shutting all sounds\nout with pillows, I hear again these grand organ-hke vi-\nbrations, which then often end by rocking me to sleep (so\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 347\nto speak). In the same way I have at times heard musical\nharmonies which I was able (if I hurried) to play, and\nthen write down. These harmonies always come in frag-\nments, and hitherto the missing bit has not been supplied\nfrom \" beyond,\" though a lady I know\u2014and to whom I\nplayed them\u2014declares they are the same as have been\nplayed to her complete by a musical medium she knows.\nThis medium (a man) doesn't know one note from the\nother in his normal state, and can only play when under\nthe influence of one of his \" guides.\" I have not heard\nhim, however, and shall not be sure the music is the same\ntill I have done so. One must make sure in all these\nthings. {Letter of March 29th, 1923.)\nApart from this interesting case the published instances\nare of an exact auditory parallel to the cerebral after-\nimages of the eye. McMsh, for instance, heard a well-\nknown march ;\nMaury has two cases of a similar sort.^\nIn the first, he had been visiting Paul Delaroche, an\nartist at whose house Ambroise Thomas had given an\nimprovisation. Lying long sleepless that night, he dozed\nand heard as in the distance several long and beautiful\npassages, which he says his poor musical memory would\nnever have permitted of his recalling in the waking state.\nOn a second occasion, lying on the deck of a steamer\nbound for Staffa, his eyes closed, he re-heard the air\nwhich the blind piper had performed on the bagpipes\non the previous evening. There is possibly here some\nconnection with the fact that most people are famiKar\nwith, of the tyranny of a rhythm or tune over the\nmental machinery, with the difference that the one is\nre-heard, while the other is, though involuntarily, recalled.\nThis division, though very slight, would not be complete\nwithout a mention of Dr. Hodgson's case, given by\nMyers,^ and illustrating in his work \" the heightening\nof sensory faculty in dream.\" The dream-music, however,\npersisted into the waking consciousness for as long as\na quarter of an hour, and was therefore truly hypno-\npompic. It was \" very rich, very sweet,\" coming in the\n1 Maury, op. cit., p. 90. ^ Human Personality, i. 369.\n\f348 F. E. Leaning. [part\nauroral hour, and dying away as the hght grew. \" No\npleasure that I have ever had in hearing music before\nor since,\" says Hodgson, \" was at all comparable with\nthe exquisite peaceful joy which flooded me as I listened\nto that music then.\"\n(2) Hypnagogic Smells.\u2014Mrs. Haweis's flight of great\npink roses was accompanied by a scent which was \" over-\npowering \" ; and in the extreme rarity of this hallucination\nher case is unfortunately all but unique. There is only\none other (on record at present) of a nice scent. This\noccurs among ]\\Irs. Tweedale's beautiful little series of\ncomplex hjrpnagogic experiences, as they evidently are,\nthough not apparently recognised as such by her. Speak-\ning of her childhood she says :\n^\nOn hot velvety nights in Jmie a curious scent of smoke\nwould come to me, the measured hollow beating of bells,\nand a tremulous far-away piping. Years after, I stood\nalone one evening on the slopes of Etna, amid the pale\nasphodels and the desolation of tumbling lava-fields, and I\nheard the pipes of Pan, the reed pipe of the herd boy, and\nlinked the past with the present. Again, passing through\na region where the smoke rose from the charcoal burners'\nfires, the scent of an ancient memory came vapouring up,\nthe unfamihar scent that puzzled my childhood. . . .\nThe bells she explains as the ring of camel bells when a\ncaravan broke camp at dawn. These two kinds of sensory\nhallucination, though separate, are given together here\nfor the sake of unity. It is remarkable that the memory\nof a scent should have endured for so many years, but\nit conforms to the greater strength of impressions in\nchildhood, frequently implied in adult accounts.\nMaury's old servant who often smelt burning ^ (of which\nshe had a dread), his old countryman who smelt a horrible\nstench which he said might be the smell of the Devil,\nconsidering the kind of faces that it accompanied, and\nLelorgne's \" odeur fetide,\" make up a group which would\nbe the better of some sweetening.

In\nMr. Griinbaum's auto-suggested phenomena ^ when he had\nasked for the perfume as well as the sight of flowers,\nit win be remembered that the flowers were in coloured\ncotton wool, on the toes of sUppers, and \" then all at\nonce I get the most fearful stink in my nose, as I never\nhad before. I puU myself out of it with a start.\" But\neleven days later, when a hand holding a rose on a long\nstem is shown, he says : \"I smell during the time of\none inhalation a very intense smell of beautiful roses.\nIt smelt much nicer than ever a real rose could smeU.\"\nAnd he adds in a note :\n\" Still a while afterwards I had\nthat dehcious smell in my nose.\" Yet another possible\nexample is that of the late Vincent Turvey, the author\nof Beginniyigs of Seership (p. 86). He had had a theo-\nlogical contretemps with a seller of Christian Evidence\nliterature in the morning, who had left some unpleasant\nimpressions behind, for \" On lying down in the after-\nnoon,\" says Mr. Turvey, \" I suddenly saw three or four\n'\ndevils '\nin the room\u2014typical orthodox fiends. Men with\ngoats' legs, cloven hoofs, little horns just over their ears,\ntails, and claw-hke hands. In colour they were entirely\nbrown, like ordinary brown paper.

The only approach to them is in INIr. Griin-\nbaum's self-induced sensations, as of his bed tilting and\nrocking, 2 and some of Baillarger's cases already referred\nto. 3 Five of these experienced touch, it is true, either as\niProc.

But none of these people\nwas in the normal condition which our hypnagogic subjects\nhave been in so far, without exception. And though it\nis true, as Dr. Michea pithily remarks ^ that \" L'hallucine\nn'est pas fou \" (and he had made a study of 123 cases),\nyet it is well to keep quite on the far side of the line\nthat separates the hallucinations of the insane, even if\nonly partially and temporarily so, from those of the\nundoubtedly healthy-minded. :\nFor this reason \" sensations \" are here limited to those\nphysical feelings which accompany the exercise of seeing\nor hearing hypnagogic phenomena, and which are internal,\nnot simulating any such as would be caused by an\nobjective stimulus. One of these was the result\n(apparently) of exercising indirect control over the subject\nof the pictures seen. The experiment is given in full\nin the Section on Control (see p. 367 infra).\nBut next morning I was very tired, and had an odd\nfeeling in the very middle of my head, as of coldness, that\nextended down the forehead to between the eyes. I have\nnot been able to induce these conditions again. Thought\nforms were moulded and produced by the act of wishing\nthem to be. It was a curious experience, and an ex-\nhausting one, for some reason.\nThis instance has the merit of being entirely spon-\ntaneous ; the following is in contrast with it, being the\naccount given me by a lady following the spirituaHstic\nadvice to \" sit for development.\" She writes :\nMy sensations as I sit may interest you. They are alto-\ngether very remarkable, and I attribute them to spirit\nagency as developing my psychic power. Sometimes I get\nvery hot, hands and face, and my cheeks feel as if being\n1 Mem. de VAcad.

Then I am conscious of a working\nin my brain, and sometimes I am left with a kind of ner-\nvous headache, which quickly dissipates. Another time I\nget deadly cold. I feel the cold creep upwards until my\ninternal organs seem like ice, and my arms and back feel\nas if a breeze is blowing over them. Then ... I get a\nsensation of plunging upwards. . . . My lips keep twitching,\nbut I am fully conscious, and it is not altogether unpleas-\nant. I have the same leaping in my brain, and as I am\nwriting have felt it three or four times.\nNo such sensations are described as accompaniments\nby the observers of the \" faces in the dark \" generally,\nhowever, nor by clairvoyants, although it is interesting\nto find Dr. Barker Smith speaking of \" surging pressures,\nbenumbing sensations of metallic coldness at the forehead,\npressures sufficient to cause cerebral haemorrhage,\" as\nthe accompaniments of auditory hallucinations.^ All these\n\" sensations \" should be taken in conjunction with the\ndata alluded to in Sec. XVIII. (Interior Vision).\nX. The Hypnopompic Vabiety. ;\nThe use of this term has been criticised by two of\nour authorities, in ways which are in opposition to each\nother, and which more or less ignore the source and\nmeaning of the name. Havelock Ellis, ^ considering only\nthat the state of semi-consciousness is similar, whether\nbefore or after sleep, says that it is \" pedantic and not\nnecessary \" to use two terms for it ; and if the aim\nwere merely to characterise a condition of consciousness,\nthat might be true. Prof. Alexander,^ however, says that\nin his own case he detects no similarity between the\nphenomena of the hypnagogic and hypnopompic periods,\nimplying that they are supposed to be identical in type,\nbut that he does not find them so ; and we shall see\non examining them in bulk that this is true of a certain\n^Medical Times, April 1923, p. 61. 1\n2 \" A Note on Hypnagogic Paramnesia,\" in Mind, vol. vi. p. 284\n(footnote 2) (1897).\n^ Proo.

There are certain broad differences, which are\neasily distinguishable.\nBut Myers, when originating the term,^ practically\nlimited it to \" pictures consisting generally in the per-\nsistence of some dream-image into the first moments of\nwaldng,\" and emphasised the fact that these \" originate\nin sleep, while in illusions hypnagogiques the vividness\nbelongs to an intermediate phase.\" This distinction has\nbeen lost sight of, or rather \" hypnopompic \" has been\nused to characterise all after-sleep or half-waking hallucina-\ntions, and cvistom has confused them with the distinct\nspecies of the \" intermediate phase.\" A separate word\nwas certainly w^anted to stand for the persisting dream-\nimagery, as the number of examples shows. Thus Taine,\nfor instance, on waking up : \"I have often seen, for a\npassing moment, the image grow pale ... a fragment of\nlandscape or the skirt of a dress appear still to float\nover the fire-irons.\" ^ Taine considered this a frequent\nexperience. Gurney, on the contrary, had come to the\nconclusion that less than one per cent, of the population\nwill be found to exemplify it.^\nAfter-Images Again.\u2014Before passing to the consideration\nof true hypnopompic images, within the Umits of Myers'\ndefinition, we may notice that one of the features common\nto the before- and after-sleep states is the seeing of\ncerebral after-images. A number of such cases have\nalready been referred to in a previous section (see p. 307\nsupra). Prof. Vignoli's vision in the very early morning,\non the ceiling, of a trelhsed balcony with ivy and creepers\nadorning the pillars and a swinging bird-cage in the\nmiddle, which he had actually seen two days before,\nmay be added here. It could not be seen with closed\neyes, and it appeared in its natural colours. But almost\nall the other cases are not of scenes in picture form,\n1 Human Personality, vol. i. p. 125.\n^ Taine, cited by James, op. cil., ii. 120. Cp. also Mtiller, p. 1394:\n\" on waking too, in a dark room, it sometimes happens that images\nof landscapes and similar objects still float before the eyes.\"\n3 Phantasms of the Livimj, i. 391 (footnote). He gives four cases\nfrom his own collection.\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 353\nbut of figures. Thus the narrator of one,^ dozing on a\nhot summer afternoon, sees on waking (witliout a previous\ndream) a fleeting view of a man on the opposite side\nof the warehouse floor, a straw hat worn towards the\nback of his head, standing regarding some papers in his\nhand. He found that the man was accustomed to stand\nso, in that place. The vision is regarded as \" the clothing\nof an emergent memory.\" Thus Dr. Bastian told Dr.\nHack Tuke of his waking after the first sleep and seeing,\nas though he were still in his study, the figure of his\nlandlady's little fair-haired child standing by the door.^\nDr. Hack Tuke's own relative, who on three occasions\nsaw a recognised dream-figure after awaking, Burdach's\nvision of his dead daughter in a similar way,^ Maurj^'s\nof his maid-servant in her white apron,* the Rev. E. H.\nSugden's of a man whom he knew well and tried to\nkick on awaking,^ all exemplify this point, and all have\nthe common feature of the figure being seen in normal\nspatial connection with the surroundings. The fact of\nrecognition, whether begun in dream or not, also marks\nthem as belonging to the \" cerebral after-image \" group.\nIt will be convenient now to deal with hypnopompic\nvisions in two groups, the first being confined to per-\nsisting dream-images, strictly according to Myers' rule,\nand the second not having any marked connection with\ndream, but resembling more the hypnagogic type. In this\nway the distinction between the two will come out broadly.\n(1) The Strict Type.\u2014^The classical example of a hypno-\npompic hallucination is Spinoza's, given by himself in a\nletter to Peter Balling, the translator of Spinoza's Prin-\nciples of Descartes' Philosophy. The translation is that\nof his biographer, Sir Fredk. Pollock.\u00ae\nOne morning, as I woke oiit of a very heavy dream (it\nbeing already day) the images which had come before me\nin my dream remained before my eyes as livelj'' as if they\n^ Jour.

This image\nvanished for the most part when, in order to divert my-\nself with somewhat else, I cast my eyes on a book or any\nother thing ; but so soon as I removed my eyes from\ntheir object withoiit looking with attention any^vhere the\nimage of this same negro appeared as lively as before, and\nthat again and again, until it vanished even to the head.\nTo this category belong also de Manaceine's visions\nof the image of Christ, crowned wdth thorns, of which\nthe change of expression, from profound sadness to \"a\nmild and joyous smile,\" continued when awake, in morning\nlight ; and her other vision of the Imperial Russian\nStandard in the national colours, of which the details\n(the eagle, two large golden tassels, etc.) were visible to\nher in absolute darkness, but with open eyes,i on waking.\nStriinipell's dream by a lady of a coffin with a mass\nof blue flowers,2 Gruithuisen's of lightning, and the books\nin a library, seen moving from left to right,^ both given\nby this author, may be added to Gurney's examples *\nof the undergraduate's green figure, the lady's blue watch-\nface. Miss Bidder's nightmare demon, and Abercrombie's\nbaboon.^ In several of these it is explicitly stated that\nthey were seen with the eyes open, and this seems true\nof hypnopompic visions as a class. In particular it\ncharacterises that little group which is singled out by\nthe presentation of the image in its complementary colour.\nOf such occurrences as spontaneous, in the dream and\nafter-dream, there are three good examples :\n(a) Meyer's little yellow dog, which was light when\nbiting him in the dream, but dark in the waking state ;\n^\n1 Op. cit., p. 280.\n2 Die Natur. u.

They are truly single persisting elements from\nthe dream state, and authorities differ as to the relation-\nship of the other visions to those of dreams. Dr. William\nMcDougall, for instance, in his classification of hallucina-\ntions,\" admits the hypnagogic, but is doubtful if dreams\nshould have a place in the table at all, while Dr. van\nEeden definitely disallows the identity of the two, of\nboth of which he had ample personal experience (see\nhis \" Study of Dreams,\" Proc.

As soon as he seems to be elsewhere than in Ms\nown chaii' or bed, we may suspect that the border-Une\nhas been passed and actual dreaming has begun.\nThe second group, then, consists of a species of visions\napproximating much more closely to those of the pre-\nsleep stage than to those we have just been surveying.\nA few have already been referred to in connection with\nother points. Mrs. Alaric Watts (see p. 312 supra) often\nsaw on wakuig suddenly the strange symbohc figures,\nwith explanations of their meaning on scrolls or shields.\nThe second example given under the sub-division \" Designs\nand Objects \" (p. 320 swpra),^ as well as three given to\nillustrate movement (p. 331 supra), consisting of a panorama\nof objects or landscapes, belong here. The young gentle-\nman whose experience was as follows ^ had it frequently\nfrom the age of twelve. \" I have often,\" he says, \" when\nwaking in middle of the night, found the room apparently\nblazing with light, heard loud music, generally of a band,\nand seen a number of men and women, generally dancing\nor in rapid motion.\" This lasted some five to ten seconds,\nand the room seen was a strange one, not his own, nor\ncould he ever recognise the dancers. Baillarger's thir-\nteenth case is of a wine merchant who was wakened\ntowards midnight by black devils, large and small, and\nby visionary men and women dancing in his cellar,\nwhich lasted till nearly six in the morning and prevented\nhim from sleep. A pretty and typical instance is that\nof a little boy who saw on the ceiling, as he lay in his\ncot in his parents' bedroom, a procession of white cocks\nwith red wattles, which \" glided backwards in single file\nalong the roof before my eyes, and disappeared one after\nanother, behind the curtain of my mother's bed without\nmaking any motion, except that each cock, just before\nit disappeared, went through all the motions of crowing,\n1 This lady says she saw with closed eyes, but most frequently afier\nsleep.\n\"Proc.

The horses trotted, the wheels turned round, the\nmen walked, and so on. These I contmued to see in\ngreat numbers many days.\" ^\nIt is possible that the recognition of the source of\nthe last processions has been supphed by the elderly\nnarrator, rather than that it was a matter of experience\nto him at the early age at which they appeared.\nThis sub-division may be completed by a reference to\nCardano's fine miscellany of hypnopompic pictures, which\nincluded castles, houses, animals, horsemen, men in varied\ngarb, soldiers, crowds, groves, forests and many other\nthings, passing swiftly in circular form (see Appendix A\nfor original Latin). He was aged from four to seven years\nwhen this occurred.\n, j . .\n\u2022 XI. Memory.\nAU attempts at accounting for the existence of hypna-\ngogic phenomena must begin by a consideration of any\nnormal and obvious causes ; and the most simple and\nprimary question that suggests itself is as to the familiarity\nor otherwise of the subject-matter. As memory is the\nmost fundamental and constantly exercised faculty of\nconscious being that we possess (since without it the\nsense of personal identity itself becomes uncertain), we\nnaturally turn to it for an explanation, in part at least,\nof the phenomena under consideration.\nBut one of the most striking and surprising facts\nabout our witnesses is the absence of what we should\nexpect to be most in evidence, the abihty to recognise\nand \" place \" them in relation to the vast host of visual\nrecollections which even the most unobservant adult must\nhave accumulated.

Thus Miiller says :\n\" They rarely\ntake the shape of recognisable realities.\" ^ A writer in\nthe Journal S.P.R. speaks of having only twice recognised\nthe faces as those of living friends, and says \" memory\nhas nothing to do with it \" {i.e. the seeing in general).'\nLang gives a single exception in his own list of seers. \" I had\nvisited Carlisle Castle, and remarked the heraldic bearings\ncarved in miniature on the door lintels by prisoners of old.\nNot long afterwards I saw them distinctly in a hypnagogic\nillusion.\" ^\nAmong my correspondents several use such expressions\nas \" faces, known and unknown,\" \" some recognised, some\nnot,\" \" sometimes recognised,\" \" sometimes friends,\" but\nthese are either professed spiritualists or persons who\nhave seen \" the faces \" since beginning the process called\n\" sitting for development \" or sitting in a circle ; those\n1 Vol. IV. p. 276. 2 Vol. VIII. p. 158.\n^Yo\\.

This deviation from the normal rule in the\ncase of spiritualists is instructive as showing the influence\nof expectation and belief, for it is the faces of the dead\nwhom they recognise, and not the living. In this con-\nnection, however, even Maury belongs to \" cette galere,\"\nfor he says (p. 86) :\n\" Ainsi je vis naguere assez souvent\nla figure de mon pere, que j'ai pourtant perdu depuis\nbien des annees puisqu'il est mort en 1831.^ Ses traits\nse presentaient a mon oeil clos avec cette meme vivacite\nqu'ils ont to ajours eu dans les nombreux reves ou il\nm'est apparu.\"\nIn spite of the fact that Maury must head the hst\nof exceptions, since he claims so often to have recognised\nthe objects and places which he saw, yet he is obUged\nto admit that he was also visited by crowds of \" pure\nfantaisie \" and \" figures fantastiques,\" and saw pictures\nof things which he had seen unconsciously, \u2014 \"a mon\ninsu \"\u2014and very strange altered reproductions of things\nseen (p. 69). So that even with him, in spite of Ms\ntheory to the contrary, recollections were not \" le cas le\nplus habituel.\" I find, indeed, only one other witness, a\nwriter in the Journal S.P.R.,^ who was in the habit of\nseeing at night things that had made an impression on\nhim during the day, such as dead leaves, after a long\nday in the forest, strawberries, etc., and the faces of\nfriends and relatives very distinctly, but he tells of having\nonce seen, at the age of seven or eight, \" an ugly old\nwoman \" whom he connected with some childish mis-\nbehaviour ; and at the time of writing he had almost\nceased to see any visions.\nThe cases of cerebral after-images, already given in\nprevious sections (see supra, pp. 306 and 352), are of\ncourse very definitely memory-images ;\nthey contrast with\nall the rest by the exactitude of detail which they display\n1 This was written at the earliest in 1848. ^ Vol. IV. p. 277.\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 361\nand which can be consciously corroborated. That they\noccur during the hypnagogic period, and possibly by means\nof the same mechanism, may be due to some other cause\nthan that which produces those phenomena themselves.\nBecause the general conclusion which we are invited by\nthe foregoing body of evidence to deduce, seems to be\nthat the known or the expected shall not form any part\nof the visions ; and that, whatever their source, it is not\nfrom the reserves of the conscious mind that they are\ndrawn. There seems, indeed, beyond tliis even, to be\nsome sort of recalcitrancy that meets us whenever a\nparticular desire is in question. For example : A. G. A.\ndescribes how he had for many years cultivated a \" picture\nmemory,\" training himself to make mental observation\nof scenes to such an extent as to be able, with the\nhelp of brief memoranda, to paint them from memory.\nBut the act of concentrating on such scenes at night\nhad the effect of bringing up the other kind. \" The\nremarkable thing was,\" he says, \" that these pictures not\nonly never resembled the scenes I would have liked to\nsee, but they never resembled any people or faces that I\nhad ever seen.\" Again, a correspondent tells me that\nshe was undergoing \" magnetic \" treatment for insomnia,\nand the practitioner would \" suggest \" various objects,\nbut she \" invariably sees things that are entirely different\nfrom what he suggests,\" and which it interests and\nsurprises him to hear about ! IMr. Griinbaum, also, in his\nnumerous auto-suggestions had bat a minimum of success.\nDr. Woolley summarizes the case thus :\n\" With the rarest\nexceptions, the vision which Mr. Griinbaum actually\nexperienced was not the one that he wished for and\nexpected \" (and frequently was helping by his own visual-\nisation) and \" sometimes, as in the smell of the carpet\nshppers, it was just the reverse.\" ^ Again, when Prof.\nAlexander was trying to form a distinct memory image\nof an Academy picture by Henner, of a girl in a red hood,\nthe vision that came was the bicycle scene with two\nyoung people (see supra, p. 326, Scenes). Lang offers yet\n^Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXVII. p. 399.\n\f362 F. E. Leaning. [part\na further example in his own experience of hypnagogic\nimages. \" Sometimes when they occur,\" lie says, \" I try\nto call up '\nthe face I shall not see,' or rather the faces,\nnow so many, of those whom we have lost awhile. But\nthis proves impossible. The unknown, the uncalled for,\nthe unexpected strange faces, fair or hideous, sweep past ;\nnever, never once, the faces of our desire.\" ^ This is\nnot the work of the \" law of reversed effort \" but what\none might almost call a \" law of perversity,\" the first\ncousin to that trick of memory which makes one forget\na well-known name or address upon being suddenly asked\nfor it. The angry exclamation of the Procktophantasmist ^\nto Faust and the phantom crowd on Walpurgis Night,\nwho persist in ignoring him :\n\"That devil's crew, they pay no attention to rules,\"\nis very often appropriate to hypnagogic hallucinations.\nXII. Control. . . ,-\nThe point just considered, of the response or absence\nof response to the wish of the perceiver, connects very\nclosely with the question of control. We should review\nhere all that has been said about the suddenness, the\nspontaneity, and independence of the visions, and how\nthey sometimes waken the drowsing consciousness with\na shock, as INIr. Fielding-Ould says. Many have testified\nto the wilfulness which makes the phenomena entirely\nunamenable. A correspondent, wishing to supply me with\nthe very latest and most recent data about his own\nexperience, writes in despair that the \" furtive beings\n\"\nwhich lurk in his brain-cells (as he dramatically puts it)\nrefuse to come out and play. \" I have insisted and com-\nmanded, begged and pleaded,\" but without result. A\nwell-known author and member of the S.P.R., however,\ntold me recently that he had only to say to himself\nthat he would hke to see \" the pictures \" and they come ;\nbut this is exceptional. As a rule they will neither be\n1 Thomas, Crystal Gazing, Introd. p. xxix.\n^i.e. Nicolai ; see MiXller, op. cit., p. 1397. - :\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 363\ncommanded nor invited ; if watched, they \" go out instant-\nly \" ^ or whirl about so rapidly as to make observation\nvery hard.^ Observers learn a certain cunning. \" Warned\nby frequent experience,\" says Taine, \" I know that sleep\nis coming on, and that I must not disturb the rising\nvision : I remain passive, and in a few minutes it is\ncomplete.\"\nSome writers speak of children as having an advantage ;\nDr. Clarke, for instance, goes as far as to write ^ \" Many\nchildren, especially very young children, possess the power,\nwhen they have closed their eyes in the dark, of surround-\ning themselves, by a simple act of volition, with a pano-\nrama of odd sights. . . . Most children who possess this\npower like to exercise it and see the show which they\ncan call up in the darkness.\" He mentions a case known\nto him where the (then elderly) man had done this \" by\nan act of vohtion,\" but as manhood approached, he adds,\n\" he lost the power, and although he has frequently tried\nsince childhood, to people the darkness in the old way,\nhe has never been able to do so.\" He himself speaks\nof having \" possessed the power of voluntarily summoning\nsuch companions about me,\" but says again, \" it was\nonly on rare occasions that I could do so by an act of\nvolition.\" He generally had to wait for the phantoms\nto come of themselves, and after childhood had passed\nnever succeeded, even with frequent endeavours, in obtain-\ning any results. Perhaps here the fact that children are\nmore liable to the visions, as is known, has caused them\nto be credited with powers which are really far more\nhmited. De Quincey's child, for instance, could get them\nto go when he told them, \" but sometimes they come\nwhen I don't tell them to come.\" Dr. Clarke's old lady\nhad suffered their coming when it was no pleasure to\nher, and she was, unhke the boy, not able to \" tell them\nto go and they go.\" Whenever children are frightened\nby their seeing, they would certainly use their volition\nto protect themselves, if they could.

[part\nwas not frightened, but pleased, could not prevent the\nsmothering of her roses by the blocks, or the diminishing\nof the vision as she grew older.\nOther adult testimony is in line with this. Thus\nMargaret Deland says she has no power to call up the\nscenes, and Galton's friend's words are very emphatic :\n\" So far from depending on any voluntary effort of the\nmind,\" he says, \" they remain when I often wish them\nvery much to depart, and no effort of the imagination\ncan call them up.\" A doctor of Harvard says : \"As I\nnearly approach the condition of ordinary sleep, I reahse\nthat I have given up all voluntary control over the action\nof my mind.\" ^ The lady of the \"globe pictures,\" ^\ntestifies that she has never, by an effort of will, been\nsuccessful in summoning any apparition. \" They come\na.nd go in their own way.\" \"It is the essential nature\nof these '\nvisions,' \" says Mrs. Arnold-Forster,^ \" that no\nexertion of will can summon them at our pleasure, and\nthat, as far as we can tell, they are wholly independent\nof our control.\" \" They cannot,\" says Fielding- Ould, \" be\nconjured up at will . . . the thing vanishes, and refuses\nto be reconstructed by the working mind for further\nscrutiny.\" \" I never could command them,\" says A. G. A.\n\" Cannot be controlled,\" says Dr. Weir Mitchell. Prof.\nHenslow, who made the most determined efforts, says\nthat visual objects in the full career of the change \" are\nimperative in their refusal to be interfered with.\" Green-\nwood concurs. Lang says, \" I cannot command or modify\nthe forms.\"\nThese dozen or so of hypnagogists represent the entirely\nnegative aspect of the connection of the conscious will\nwith the visions. It is proper to see what can be said\non the other side, and to turn to such examples as we have\nof control : for they do exist, though not in large numbers.\nThe simplest form is the repetition of a picture already\nseen. This is difficult, but the seer of the \" Cottage in\nthe Circle \" (see supra p. 295) succeeded, though she\niJowr. S.P.R., Vol. IX. p. 121. ^ p^^c.

Another attempted\nform of control is in the change of subject-matter; Burdach\nis reported to have been able to change \" hideous and\nterrifying faces \" to figures of kaleidoscopic character\nby concentrating liis attention on architectural views.\n^\nProf. M. relates ^ that after the first spontaneous appear-\nances (produced by the impression made by the Great\nExhibition of 1851) his will \" used often to help them\non,\" although he could not always get them when he\nwanted to. Sir John Herschel's landscapes were seen\n\" within Mmits variable at wUl,\" while one of the writers\nin the Journal'^ says also, \"I can dismiss these images\nor change to a new series with a shght effort of will.\"\nWe may compare with this Mr. Deering's account, given\nin full in the earlier edition of Phantasms of the Living,^\nof his vision, while resting in the afternoon, of a scene\nin a novel which his daughter was reading beside him.\nHe says that the \" gardens, slopes, rivulets, and vai'ious\nhttle vistas,\" which he was accustomed to see in the\nhaK-waking stage could be dismissed at his bidding, and\nimmediately replaced by others, and remarks that his\ncontrol was \" more immediate and more absolute \" over\na change of figures than of scenes. On the occasion in\nquestion after twice bidding the scene to go (as it con-\ntained a coffin) and finding it persist, he decided to wake\nfuUy, and so ended it.\nThe method of ending the vision by opening the eyes,\nor by an involuntary return to full wakefulness, is a\nform of \" control,\" if it can be termed so, which is\nmore common than any other.\nSo far as direct voHtion goes, it evidently acts within\n^Phantasms, i. 474. -De Manaceine, p. 239.\n^Proc.

[part\nvery circumscribed limits, if at all, with the majority.\nThe few persons who have deliberately induced the power\nof seeing are in rather a different category. The artist\nwho saw decorative designs ^ carried on an educative\nprocess for several years, beginning by willing to see letters\none by one, as if written in gold on a black ground ;\nbut this induced the true hjrpnagogic faculty, for she also\ncame to see faces, and frequently entire figures moving\nin a landscape. Just the same thing happened with\nMeyer, who after reaching the point at which he could\ncall before his eyes almost any object which he pleased,\nand in its own natural colour and illumination, says\nthat some time after the pictures have arisen they vanish\nor change into others \" without my being able to prevent\nit.\" ^ He also failed to see fancy objects \" but familiar\nones came instead.\"\nSo far, all the examples adduced have been of direct\nefforts made to affect the visions ; but we come now to\na little group in which more success is attained by the\nindirect method of influencing the thoughts. The con-\nclusion that this was the better way was arrived at by\nMarie de Manaceine, who also illustrates it by the case\nof a girl known to her, who by looking at a beautiful\npicture before she went to bed managed to \" drive away\nthe ugly faces \" that otherwise would come.^ Maury\nalso has an example of the method of impressing a du'ec-\ntion on the mind, when he saw a picture of Ingres'\n\" Odahsque \" after thinking of the Marquis d'Hervey's\nbook (which occupied much of his attention) in which\nodalisques are mentioned.* Prof. Alexander, who makes\nthe third salient feature of the visions the fact that they\nare extraordinarily independent and unpredictable, and\nthat they come and go of themselves without apparent\ninterconnection, remarks :\n^ \" On occasion I have been\niJowr.

Forthwith the image\ntransforms itself into a frog.\" A very similar report is\ngiven by Mr. Gheurj^ de Bray in his account,^ where he\nalso speaks of the things pictured as entirely beyond his\nvolition, as to the state that produces them, but partially\namenable to his volition when once begun. His type is\nthat of the continuous panoramic landscape, and this\ncould be modified, as from flat country to hilly, or adorned\nwith the blossoms of springtide fruit-trees, but the changes\nwere a natural development of what was already in\nprocess. \" If I '\nwilled '\nan unUkely thing,\" he says, \" it\ndid not come.\" But on the other hand, when he willed\nto see a \" crashed \" aeroplane he did see it. Warcollier,\nwho tried an exactly similar experiment, failed. ^ Was\nthis because the one seemed to be in the air, and the\nother, as normally, on the solid earth ?\nA correspondent sends me a good illustration in detail\nof just this \" indirect \" method, drawn from immediate\nexperience and unaffected by theory or the knowledge of\nother people's methods. The type is different from the\npanoramic, but resembles it in being of nature or still-\nlife, and occurring after the first sleep, but clearly not\na continuation of dream.

This time I took myself severely\nin hand, resolving to be calm, quite calm, and lay passive.\nPresently I saw the big trunk of a tree, with mossy\nroots, at the foot of the trees even several small indistinct\nwhite objects.

Then they shifted again\u2014and '\nNo '\nI thought\n'\nthey are not mushrooms, they're Playing Caeds.' And\nin a trice they became playing cards.

About half a dozen\nwere in bloom and others in all stages, when it was\ngone ! Most certainly I was not asleep. My mentality\nwas most keenly awake and absorbed in this quite new\ndevelopment.

Significance.\nThis is to be taken as strictly limited to the inter-\npretation placed on the phenomena by the observers,\nand not to the value of them in the abstract. The\nsignificance is, in individual cases, of an entirely different\nnature according as it is seen from the point of view of\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 369\npersonal relationships, or from that which it holds in\nthe estimation of the student, and quite possibly from\nwhat it is in the natural order. Nothing more can be\nclaimed for it, than that the observer beheves or feels\nor thinks that there is such and such a meaning in\nthe visions, and however valueless his or her opinion\nmay be, it is not a complete study that would ignore\nor omit it altogether. For this reason, though there is\nlittle to be said and that little is obscure owing to\nthe highly personal nature of the facts, yet it has its\nplace.\nThus one of my correspondents is convinced that the\nscenes she sees are those of her own previous lives.\nWhere the belief in reincarnation already exists this is\nvery natural, and probably others share the idea, since\nthis is an age in which the ancient doctrine is not with-\nout its followers. But the interest of the case lies in\nthe fact that a connected series of visions should occur,\nsince from all we have hitherto seen the opposite is\nthe rule. Upon enquiring how the subject knew the scenes\nto have the connection ascribed to them, and whether\nany sort of corroboration had been obtained, my in-\nformant wrote that she was informed by her \" guide\n\"\nthat the scenes were of her previous hves, that she\nrecognised the figure as herself in each picture in spite\nof changes of dress, age, and surroundings, and that\nno verification so far had been forthcoming. It is open\nto debate whether this is a case of directive influence,\nacting broadly, or not. Considering the countless series of\nconnected scenes which modern fiction, plays and films\nprovide, it is surprising that we do not get more of\nsuch instances ; but it does not seem to be so.\nOf a totally opposite sort is the conviction, of which\nMrs. Tweedale's is an example, that the scenes are pre-\nmonitory, and due to fall in the future at some time\nIf people 7nust somehow relate the visions to themselves\nas having some kind of personal significance always,\nand they cannot place them in their own previous ex-\nperience, this is also a natural and reasonable point of\nview.

'\n[part\npremonitory clairvoyance go so far to support the\npossibility of visions of fut^^re surroundings taking place,\nthat no dogmatic negative can be pronounced on the\ntheory. At the same time common sense emphasises\nthe fact that as all such visions cannot reasonably be\nbrought under this explanation, and there is no test\nbut fulfilment to distinguish the true premonitory from\nany others ; the belief ends where it begins, in private\npersonal opinion, and makes no contribution to our actual\nknowledge.\nBetween the acceptance of hypnagogic visions as of\na possible past and a possible future, comes the third,\nthat of the actual present, and the extraordinary distinct-\nness and the living movement and detail of many of\nthe pictures give a reasonable basis for this idea, especially\nin those who have heard more or less of clairvoyance\nand have not made much study of hallucinations. Thus\nStead felt that what he saw \" was not a picture\u2014it was\nthere.\" The two scenes \" simply came as if I had been\nable to look through a glass at what was occurring\nsomewhere else in the v\/orld. I had my peep and then\nit passed.\" This would describe the impressions of many,\nbut the fleeting nature of the scenes, the impossibility\nof proving definitely that what was seen was really\ntaking place, perhaps in some distant covmtry, makes\nthe obtaining of evidence insuperably hard. Since the\nvisions are usually at night, the day-time life of the globe\nis removed many degrees from us, but as it never ceases,\nthat is no barrier to ghmpses of it reaching the minds\nof those who are at the ultra-sensitive epoch of the\nhypnagogic time.\nThe fact that this period is one of high suggestibility\nis well estabhshed. Hudson ^ gives it a high place in his\nmethod of mental therapeutics ; de Manaceine's experi-\nments, ^ and Baudouin's work on the principles of M.\nCoue,^ illustrate it by practical examples. And visions\n^ The Law o\/ Psychic Phenomena, chap. xiv. (1893).\n^ Sleep, pp. 199-218 (1897).\n' Suggestion et Auto-suggestion, pt. ii. chap. ii. p. 106 et seq.

Three\nsuch cases have been communicated to me ; in one a\nlady says :\n\" Since writing to you last, one of my\nsisters has been ill. I woke a few nights ago and saw\nher and her bed, a facsimile, in my own room.\" In another\na mother saw her son, his eyes closed, leaning back in\na railway carriage, wearing a cap, all of which points\nwere contrary to his use and habit. But they turned\nout to have been true of him at the time. A third case\nI wiU give in full, by the kindness of my correspondent\nin Edinburgh, whose uncoloured miniatures have already\nbeen referred to (p. 338 supra). After the description of\nthese she continues :\n\" AU next day, Sunday 4th February, I saw two\nroads, one behind a leafless beech-hedge, and great beech\ntrees beyond ; the other with snow everywhere, strange\ntrees and queer feathery bushes continually blowing\nabout, instead of the hedge. Into this latter scene came\na figure very Hke my husband, but the face was always\nblurred. Also three men occasionally stood together, as\nif to be photographed, but their faces were blurred.\nThere seemed often to be a vehicle moving along, but\nI sensed it more than saw it. . . . I have written tliis\nfrom my notes, but a curious thing has happened since.\nMy husband, who is in a lonely part of Northern British\nColumbia, wrote and said he had a long and tedious\ndrive on a very rough sticky road on the Sunday, 4th\nFeby.\" In reply to inquiries she wrote further : \" I\nam glad to be able to teU you I can absolutely verify\nthat it was in the snowy road I saw my husband's\nfigure coming towards me, also the three men. Tlu-ee\nfive in the next place to him, but their faces were blurred,\nand though I know two of them, I had no feehng who\nthey were. I can also verify it was about three weeks\nafter that I heard from my husband that he drove home\nthat day. The roads being difficult, it took him a long\ntime. He has never mentioned driving to this place\n\f372 F. E. Leaning. [part\nbefore, but always going by train. The next letter men-\ntioned willows, which I had never connected with the\nplace before, and the waving bushes might have been\nwillows.\" That the state of consciousness immediately\nafter sleep is one very favourable to telepathic impressions\nreceived much illustration from the series of experiences\nof this sort reported by Mr. Hubert Wales (in Proc. 8.P.R.\nXXXI. 124 sq.). These scenes were strange to the\npercipient, but recognised by Mr. Wales, e.g. his wood-\nshed, garden, cat in the larder, etc., and many little\nhome intimacies quite unknown to Miss Samuels, who\nsaw and made notes of them \" at all manner of un-\nearthly hours, whenever she happened to wake.\" Note,\nhowever, that attempts at definite thought-transference\nfailed (p. 127).\nIt would appear from such instances as these that\nin the hypnagogic state pictures sometimes are those of\nactual circumstances, though the proportion of such is\nperhaps very small, and except by actual recognition\nthey cannot be distinguished from the melee which present\nthemselves.\nA fourth pomt in the significance of the visions is\nthat they sometimes have a moral value for the percipient.\nThey might say, if they had a collective voice, \" AU\nfor your dehght we are not here,\" but sometimes for\nedification. Thus Mrs. Haweis connected the vision of\nthe roses with an \" elevated spiritual state \" ; Mrs.\nTweedale says of her childhood experiences, \" Childish\ndays but sacred nights.\" Greenwood learned weighty\nlessons from his \"faces.\" Maury, as one might expect,\nand others who think with him, attributes many visions\nof the saints to this class. It is certainly the fact that\nintimate spiritual lessons are conveyed to some in this\nway ; but in the nature of the case they cannot be\nmade use of hke the rest. Sometimes a scene is allegorical\nor a symbol ; such as (perhaps) the late Miss E. K.\nBates' vision of the swallows which she took to represent\na protective band of spirits,^ or Amanda Jones's of the\n^ Seen and Unseen, pp. 45, 46, Pop. Ed.

Summary.\nOut of the 120 instances described or referred to in\nthe foregoing, we may now place on one side, as of\nsubsidiary value, those few (ten at the most) which\nillustrate the voluntary projection of mental images. They\nare subsidiary because they employ definite volition\nand the conscious use of imagination, and take place\nusually in daylight and in full consciousness. AU these\npoints place them in contrast with the seeing of hypna-\ngogic images. Next to these we may place on one side\na larger group of those who see (positive) cerebral after-\nimages of scenes or objects. The characteristics which\nalso separate these from hypnagogic visions are that,\nfirst, they present exact and recognised details of some\nrecently-seen subject. In almost all the cases (17 in all)\nthe vision is of something that has made a marked\nimpression by means of its novelty or its requirement\nof prolonged attention during the previous day. Secondly,\nthey are seen with open eyes, and in a few cases*\n(Vignoli, Dr. Lombard) in daylight. Of these. Dr. Lombard\nand the three persons with him were able to produce\nthe reproduction at will, and were certainly fully awake.\nPsychic Autobiography, p. 221. The visions of Mrs. Alaric Watts\nand \" Mrs. W.\" (see pp. 356 and 338) were notably of this type.\n^Jour. S.P.R., Vol. VIII. p. 244.\n^ For an example of the readiness of some people to find \" meanings \"\nfor other people's visions, see Occult Review XI., 334 (\" Dreamer \") and Ibid\nXII., 51 (R. B. Span).\n*That of Prof. Vignoli is quoted in Proc. S.P.R., Vol. X. p. 141, and Dr.\nLombard's is referred to on p. 307\n\f374 F. E. Leaning. [part\nThe approximation to the hypnagogic pictures is chiefly\nin those cases where the beholder was not only in the\ndark but m bed, and therefore, in the nature of the\ncase, courting sleep ; but it has been remarked that\neven then the subject-matter did not repeat itself on\nsubsequent nights, but only on the one occasion on which\nthe deepest, because the newest, impression, had been\nmade. ; ;\n.\nNext to the seeing (automatically) of after-images\nshould be reckoned all those cases which I have called\nhypnopompic of the strict type. A person who has\nonce, or only on a few occasions, seen a dream-figure\nprolong itself into the waking state, is not a subject\nfor studying hypnagogic phenomena from. These single,\nusually motionless residua of dream, are seen with open\neyes, by daylight, and do not otherwise display the\nmarks of the other type, notably that of continual change,\nand they are far briefer in duration.\nOf the mass of typical cases which remain, an analysis\ngives the following results as regards frequency.\nTable of Frequency.\nPer cent.\nOnce only ...... 6\nA few nights ------ 5\nShort period (weeks or months) - 3\nRecently (since 1920) - . - . 5\nIn youth only (up to 20 years) 12\nOccasionally ------ 5\nOver a span of years - - . . 9\nFrequently ------ 36\nLife-long 16\nAt any time, on closing the eyes - 3\n100\nIn this table none of Baillarger's cases have been in-\ncluded, for reasons previously given, but the number\nfor \" Short period \" would then have been considerably\nincreased.

The distinction between \" Fre-\nquently \" and \" Life-long \" is based on the statement\nof each of the latter subjects that this was the case.\nAn analysis of the health conditions obtaining is given\nbelow. In the majority of the cases no statement is\nmade, and the presumption is, therefore, that there was\nno occasion for it. In eleven cases the witnesses have\nmentioned that their health was good ;\nGurney's relative\nwas \" very good \" ; and several of my correspondents,\nwhen not personally known to me, have yet given enough\ninternal evidence in their letters to enable them to be\nplaced with assurance. The small \" delicate \" class, who\nare not ill and yet not robust, consists of Prof. M.\n(\"in delicate health for a year \") ;\nHerrick, who suffered\nfrom insomnia ;\nMaury, who suffered many iUs ; Dr. Clarke,\nwho gives enough internal evidence in his book to judge\nby, and died of a luigering illness at the age of fifty-six ;\nDe Quincey and Lamb, who are both known to the\npublic fairly intimately.

So far as we have\ndata, however, the case stands as follows :\nSight and Visualisation.\nPer cent.\nEyesight, good 27-5\n,, bad (short, weak, almost gone) - - 12-5\nVisualising power, good ..... 37-5\n\u201e \u201e poor 22-5\n100\nIf the proportions here indicated are any guide to the\nremaining 60 per cent., both good sight and visualisation\npredominate but are not indispensable.\nThe visions themselves form five main classes, beginning\nwith those of colour only, or a sense of diffused light,\nand embracing all possible visual images. Those con-\nsisting of scenes are often highly coloured, brilliantly\nhghted, very distinct, miniature in size, and contain\nnumerous details, frequently of persons in movement,\nespecially towards the end of the hypnagogic period\nwhen actual sleep supervenes. In the case of faces\nalone, and fragments of the person, the process of form-\ning can be watched ; either as building up from cloudy\nmasses and bright spots, or as drawn in fiery or phos-\nphorescent lines. In this they contrast with patterns,\nlandscapes, objects and complete figures, which are usually\npresented entire. Change, with more or less rapidity, is\na mark of these pseudo-hallucinations. It is effected\neither by transition from one figure to another, by fading\nout and substitution, or by panoramic movement. They\nare affected by any euttempt at conscious observation,\nand then either disappear or become \" impossible.\"\nA small proportion, 12 per cent., have auditory hallu-\ncinations, either accompanying the visual or predominating\nover them ; still fewer have olfactory and tactile sensa-\ntions. About 3 per cent, report internal sensations which\ncoincide with the seeing of the pictures.\nThe two points which offer the widest problem, and\non which there is most ground for at least stating the\ncase as to the significance and play of causes, are memory\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 311\nand volition. The subject of memory, though 22 per\ncent, of the accounts give no clue as to the recognition\nor otherwise of the subject-matter, yet leaves a sufficiently\nlarge number of those who do, to form some conclusions\nupon. They admit of being analysed as follows :\nMemory.\nPer cent.\nAll matter quite unrecognised - - - 60-5\nUnrecognised, with one, two or three ex-\nceptions ------- 5-215\nUsually, or often recognised - - - - 20-25\nPartially recognised and unrecognised - - 14-035\n100\nThe above figures refer to the seers, and not to the\nvisions themselves. That is, only one-fifth, for instance, of\nall who have described their visions have stated them to\nbe of recognised persons, places, or things, while three times\nthat number say that they never see the known or famiUar.\nIn respect of any command exercised by the wiU, it\nis much more difficult to analyse the data than when\nwe are deahng with memory. A large number of people\n(52 per cent.) do not indicate that they have ever\nattempted in any way to control the hypnagogic visions ;\nit has no more occurred to them than to try and alter\nthe course of a play on the stage or to rule their dreams.\nAnd of the remainder, less than half have done so, either\nwith experimental intentions or otherwise. Those who have\ntried must be divided into two classes : those in whom\nthe minimum of control is achieved, either by holding\nthe vision (usually only two minutes or so) or by getting\nit repeated, which I call \" shght control \" ;\nand those who by\nself-training or temperamental facility can change the\nsubject-matter or \" see \" what they wish. A difficulty\narises by the casual use of \" wiUing \" where one suspects\nwishing would be a more correct term. It may be very\ndifficult to draw the fine between the two, but nature\nseems to do so when she grants success to the wish\nand withholds it from the command. And with the majority\nof those who have tried, neither is of any avail. Some\n\f378 F. E. Leaning. [part\ncases, too, are complex, beginning like De Quincey or\nMeyer in a deliberate purpose but not being able to\ncheck the mechanism when desired later on ;\nor, as in\nthe case of McNish, being able by opening the eyes to\nbanish Ducrow and the whole audience, but not able by\nany effort to change the music or soften it.\nThese things make any attempt at classification very\nimperfect, and the smaUness of the number concerned\nperhaps makes it futile, but for the sake of completeness\nthe proportions may be stated.\nPer cent.\nPersons with no control - - - - - 54-65\nControl by will (shght) 20-8\n\u201e (much) 14-45\n,, ,, wish, or indirectly - - - - 10-1\n100\nXV. Crystal Vision : A Comparison.\nSeveral authorities have observed that hypnagogic\nvisions and visions m the crystal have certain points\nof resemblance ; and are so far cognate that the examina-\ntion of the less known phenomena may make a comparison\nof profit. Crystal visions have received a far larger share\nof attention, and much has already been done towards\npreparing the field for their study. There are at least\nfive good standard series, presented by observers of the\nfirst class, apart from others as good in quahty but\nfewer in number. These are Miss Goodrich-Freer's own\nvisions,^ those of Mrs. Verrall ^ and Miss A.^ given by\nMyers, those of Miss Angus * given by Lang, and Mrs.\niln Proc. S.P.R., Vol. V. pp. 486-621 (1889); Vol. VIII. pp. 484-\n492 (1892) ; and see Vol. X. p. 108.

A bibliography\nof the subject may be found in Mr. Theodore Besterman's\nwork, Crystal Gazing [1924].\nA careful examination of these along the same lines\nas have already been followed as regards hypnagogic pheno-\nmena shows no striking discrepancies between the two classes.\nTaken in order, and omitting illustrative detail, the con-\nclusions are as follow :\n(1) Diffusion.\u2014-The mtmber of persons able to see in\nthe crystal has been variously estimated as from 5 per\ncent, at \" a high estimate \" (Thomas) to 20 per cent.\n(Myers), while both Miss Goodrich-Freer and Lang certainly\nsuggest a higher proportion still by their references to\nthe numbers of cases personally known to them. These\ndiffering opinions throw us back on a comparison of\nunits, and it then becomes clear that the two activities\nare not always, or even often, found combined in the\nsame -subject. Two persons only report themselves as\nbelonging to both classes (Miss Goodrich-Freer and Miss\nN. de Gernet, both life-long clairvoyants) ; while seven\nhypnagogists tell us that they have tried without result\nto get visions in the crystal. They include M. Gheury\nde Bray, Andrew Lang, Prof. Ladd, and M. WarcoUier,\nwho attributes the greater diffusion of hypnagogic pheno-\nmena among the English to the national habits of drink-\ning champagne, tea and coffee. ^ In his case the attempt\nto use the crystal induced the hjrpnagogic visions ; but\nsuch scanty evidence as we have does not show, as we\nmight expect it to, axij essential connection.\n(2) Frequency and Health.\u2014As regards both these character-\nistics, the two classes of phenomena are analogous ; that is to say,\nthe gazing faculty is not constant, even in the best \" scryers,\"\nbut subject to longer or shorter periods of intermission ; and in\nboth, good health is conducive to its activity, while illness or\nweariness interferes. The evidence on this point is good.^\n''Modern Psychical Phenomena, pt. iii. pp. 301-327 (1919).\n^ Op. cit., p. 79.\n' See, for instance, Miss Goodrich-Freer in Borderland, vol. i. p. 127 ;\nThomas, Crystal Gazing, p. xlix (Lang's subjects) ; Proc.

[part\n(3) Physical Sight and Visualising Power.\u2014There is the\nsame admixture of good and poor quality as among\nhj^nagogists, though it is perhaps less often in evidence.\nThe powerful visuahser like Miss Goodrich-Freer, the very\nshortsighted Miss A., a very bad visualiser, and Mrs.\nVerrall with unlike sight, preventing the simultaneous use\nof both eyes at any time\u2014all ahke saw well in the crystal,\nwhile some use a dark \" speculum,\" or see in the dark,\nor use the crystal with the eyes shut (Miss N. de Gernet).^\nThis abihty seems to indicate a link between the visions\nseen only in darkness and those seen only in Hght, by\nthe majority of seers of either kind.\n(4) Subject-Matter and Features.\u2014The pictures in the\ncrystal match in kind at every point with those under\nstudy. The preliminary clouding is well known, though\nit does not invariably take place ; faces are a less constant\nfeature in the descriptions as a whole, and figures more\nso. \" Fancy \" pictures occur, perhaps, in less abundance,\nand geometrical designs more seldom still. Other points\nof similarity are (a) the building up of objects ^ as\nwell as their appearance \" suddenly and completely \" ;\n(6) the coming of a number of pictures without inter-\nconnection ;\n3 (c) the miniature scale, all usually being\nseen within the limits of the field provided.* In\nthe case of crystals perhaps the circularity of form\ninvites the faculty into play, as some people see in this\nway who do not see (or we do not hear of their doing\nso) in other surfaces. Sometimes, however, the crystal\nseems to disappear. ^ {d) The pictures are usually seen\nin colour, although there is nothing like the prominence\n1 See Thomas, p. xvi ;\nWarcollier, p. 76 ; Proc.

Thus Miss A. \" describes\nthings not as if she saw them in a picture, but as if\nshe were actually there.\" ^\n(\/) Crystal visions do not present\nthe uniformly high degree of illumination which the\nother type seem to, but there is apparent a tendency\nto select objects which are bright or striking. The dark\nwall covered with white jasmine, seen by Miss Goodrich-\nFreer, the lake landscape with two snowy peaks and\none sharply defined dark hill, seen by Mrs. Verrall, are\nexamples, (g) There is a more frequent mention of objects\nnot being very distinct in the crystal, in contrast to the\nemphasis laid on distinctness in the other visions, (h) The\nduration varies with individual circumstances, and lasts\nfrom a few seconds to a few minutes, and from a few\nminutes to over half an hour.* And whereas some gazers\nlose the picture if the eyes are turned away, or the\nattention wanders, others (Mrs. Peppier is the case in\npoint) can come and go, and find the scene unchanged\non their return, (i) There is an element of \" perversity,\"\nas in the hypnagogic cases. Thus Miss A. says :\n\" If I\nwish to see a particular person, I cannot do so, but\nI probably see something quite different.\" ^ Mss Goodrich-\nFreer, however, often saw what she wished to, or saw\nher visuahsed mental image transferred to the crystal.^\nMrs. Verrall's experience was that often she saw nothing\nin the crystal, but got a mental picture suggesting some-\nthing she had forgotten to do. ' This last variation is not\none that is reported by hypnagogists.\n1 Fr. V. Vay, \" Visionen in Wasserglasse,\" see Proc. S.P.R., Vol. V. p. 504.\n^Proc. S.P.R., Vol. VIII. p. 474.\n3 Proc.

The actual\nsources of crystal-visions have been far more closely\nscrutinised than is possible with the hypnagogic variety,\nand the definite knowledge that certain distinct classes\nexist, following on the other points of resemblance, goes\nsome way towards giving a clue by analogy, if nothing\nmore, to the real character of the latter.\nThe three most prominent elements reflected by crystal\nvisions are, next to scenes consciously recognised :\n(1) Scenes and objects either quite forgotten, or un-\nconsciously observed ;\n(2) Scenes in the mind, or having at some time been\nso, of some person or persons present\n;\n(3) Actual scenes not known at the time to anyone in\nthe immediate entourage of the gazer, but verifiable.\nThe proportion which pictures of the first class, sub-\nconscious memories, bears to the whole, not only differs\nwith individuals but depends on the pains taken by\nthe observer to ascertain their source. The best and\nlongest study of this kind is Miss Goodrich-Freer's. Out\nof a total of seventy items she could account for all but\ntwo or three.\nThe best example of the second class of crystal visions\nis given us in Miss Angus. Lang made a special point\nof persuading her, and other \" scryers \" when he came\nacross them to try and see in the crystal some scene\nin the mind of himself or a third person present. Many\nsuccesses are recorded of her powers, and several of\nher seeing something which was verified by those who\nhad no intention at all of so affecting her. They were\nnot only unconscious agents at the time, but the subject-\nmatter occasionally was unknown even to the living hnk\nwhich made it possible. This forms the very furthest\nlimit to which telepathy can be assumed.\nThe third class of crystal visions, of veridical occur-\nrences, either in the past (historical) or the present, is\nexemplified in Miss A. The observers referred to, and\nothers, all speak of the \" fancy pictures,\" not coming\nunder any of the three main heads just given, but there\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 383\nseems no means of discovering in what general propor-\ntions they occur. Mrs. Verrall, out of her thirty-three\ncases, finds some raison d'etre for nine, but this leaves\ntwenty-four, or 72 per cent, unaccounted for. Mrs. Pep-\npier, whose memoranda must run to something between\n100 and 200, has a small number which may be ascribed\nto thought-transference from her husband, many which\nhave verisimihtude and might be happening somewhere,\nand many \" quite crazy.\" Even all of these, she says,\nare \" like a drop in the ocean \" of the sum total seen.\nHer contribution is concerned more with the mechanism\nof the seeing than with the significance of the things\nseen.\nIt is to be observed as a point of essential importance\nthat in all these classes alike, the sub-conscious memory,\nthe telepathic, the clairvoyant, and the imaginative, the\nsubject is at first sight strange and unrecognised, exactly\nas the hypnagogic visions are so often reported to be.\nThe absence of any connection with the gazer's own\ninterests or thoughts is therefore marked, and the part\nwhich conscious memory plays is reduced to as small\na section in the one case as in the other.\nFinally, the exercise of control over the visions in the\ncrystal is perhaps rather greater, with practised gazers,\nthan it is found to be with hypnagogists ; but possibly\nthey are on a level. The power, whatever it is, exists\nmore strongly in some than in others : therefore they\ncan count on its coming into play more often. But\nthat is almost the hmit.\nRegarding the Ukeness of crystal visions as a whole\nto the hypnagogic, one would be inclined to see in the\nlatter a more elementary form of the former, and to\nsay that the chief difference is that while the hypnagogist\nis dependent upon the spontaneous exercise of his faculty\nin the dark or with closed eyes, and in a twilight state\nof consciousness, the other can do so in full consciousness,\nwith open eyes, under the stimulus supplied by the crystal-\nline or reflecting surface. And we might go on to reason\nthat since the subconscious contents of the mind con-\ntribute memory-images, telepathic impacts, and clairvoyant\n28\n\f384 F. E. Leaning. \u2022\n, ,\n[part\nimpressions to the crystal, these may also be reckoned\namong the hypnagogic material, only allowing a somewhat\nlarger part to imagination in the last.\nThis conchision can only be adopted with caution and\nprovisionally, however, for the reason that both the\nclasses of seers concerned speak of differences now and\nthen between their experiences, and although it is very\ndifficult to understand in what the differences consist,\nfor us who know none of them except by hearsay, it\nis evident that this corresponds to something which we\ncannot ignore in trying to understand the phenomena.\nThus when a normal clairvoyant says that the hypnagogic\nvisions are different from what he sees otherwise but\nyet not normally ; or when Mrs. Verrail describes a vision\nwhich came while looking into the crystal but \" not in any\nway resembling a crystal-vision \" ; and Myers speaks of\nthe pictures which came in a Cambridge undergraduate's\ncrystal but which \" almost at once followed quite another\nanalogy\u2014they became like very brilliant illusions hypna-\ngogiques,\" it is clear that there is some distinctive\nelement at work. Whether that element concerns the\nmechanism used in seeing, or some actual quality in\nthe nature of the thing seen itseK, is impossible to\ndiscriminate without a much deeper scrutiny ; and it\ncan only be effected by a comparison of many witnesses,\nand not on the strength of any one person's experience.\nXVI. Theories and Explanations.\nThe general survey of the data has now been carried\nfar enough to give place to a view of the various theories\nput forward to account for them. These range from a\nmodest and total denial of any kind of explanation, ^\nthrough many speculative and questioning suggestions, up\nto the most definite and dogmatic pronouncements. These\nlast, perhaps it is needless to say, do not agree with\neach other, and are mutually exclusive often ;\nyet all\niPjoc. S.P.R., Vol. VIII. pp. 477, 478.\n^ E.g.

Where weakness arises is from\nassuming that all the effects are of a uniform order,\nand therefore open to a like uniformity of cause. We\ncan admit that some of the effects have a physical\ncausation, some a mental, both arising from our own\nunconscious activities ; that others come originally from\nother minds than our own, either incarnate or discarnate ;\nand yet others from no mediating mind, but simply as\nthe result of accepting the universe as our five senses\naccept it. These five heads divide the whole field between\nthem without conflict ; the actual problems arise from\nthe difficulty of discriminating results, and the nature\nof the faculty involved. If, as one result, the expression\nwe are famiUar with of \" seeing with the mind's eye\n\"\nshould be proved less figurative than literal, and some\nadvance made in the comprehension of mental, or psychic,\nsight, the study will be well justified.\nOf the five solutions of hypnagogic perplexities given\nabove, the two first, or purely subjective, have received\nmost attention ; and of these two, that of physical\ncausation in the eye itself has the largest number of\nsupporters.\nWe will consider first then what is to be said on this point.\n(1) The Apparatus of Physical Sight. \u2014Entoptic Pheno-\nmena.^\u2014A description of the intricate structures with\nwhich Nature has furnished the exterior end of the optic\nnerve is to be found in any text-book of elementary\nphysiology, and it is not therefore necessary to go into\nfurther detail here than to remind ourselves that the\nretinal surface is formed to receive etheric (light) vibra-\ntions of from 450 million million per second (red light)\nto 750 milhon milHon (violet light). ^ Behind the trans-\nparent window of the cornea, and the regulating curtain\nof the iris, we find it furnished with an aqueous and\na vitreous humour at the front and back respectively\n* Entoptic, lying within the eye itself.\n^Crookes, Sir W., Rep.

I find only one in-\nvestigator who speaks of any entoptic phenomena as\nvisible also in the dark. Miss Beatrice Lindsay, after\nthree years work on the subject, at Girton, put her\nconclusions into a paper read before the British Associa-\ntion.^ Her first and second classes are differentiated partly by\nthis very question of darkness, the first dealing with pheno-\nmena absent in complete darkness, the second with the en-\ntoptic images resulting from pressure, automatically (by closing\nthe Uds) or artificially appHed. These are distinguished by\ntheir metallic lustre, by their colour, varying from pale\nyellow through pale green to electric blue or purple, and\nby their visibility in the dark. They comprise among\nother things discs, dots, occasionally rings, and a grating\ncomposed of sets of bright bars at right angles with\none another, indicating structure of some kind in the\nfovea centralis. In a following paper, ^ she speaks of a\nconstant current of minimal points of light \" invariably\npresent to the normal eye when trained to such\nobservations.\"\nIf in addition to all this we take into consideration\nall that has been established concerning the self-luminous\nqualities of organic matter and the eyes in particular,\nit is evident that we are furnished forth with an abund-\nance of \" intra-organic stimuH \" which will account for\na certain proportion of the hypnagogic phenomena. Con-\nsequently, writer after writer has dismissed them en bloc\nas having no other source. Prof. Ladd may be taken\n^ Rep. Brit. Assoc.

He cites Miiller,\nGruithuisen, Purkinje, Radestock, Wundt, and Maury, as\nsupporters of this view, and others could be added,\nincluding those who would identify dream phenomena with\nthem, and apply an entirely physiological explanation to\nboth. Thus we may take Cane's dogmatic statement as\nrepresentative when he says :\n\" All the phenomena of\ndreams are fully accounted for by the auto-sensations\nphysiologically developed within the body . . . sometimes in-\ncreased . . . and modified by external impressions and stimuli.\"\nThese facts, of matter presenting the features of\nbrilliancy, rapidity of movement, various colours, cloudi-\nness, and a variety of shapes and sizes all dwelling in\nthe eye itself, and coming into prominence when all other\nvisual stimulation is withdrawn, do logicallj^ account for\nthose characteristics in the hypnagogic visions. The\ncircularity of form, produced perhaps by the iris or by\nthe discs, the impossibility of retaining a given com-\nbination of elements (particularly if the circulation be\nrapid) or of repeating it exactly, the frequency of bright\nor fight points, and the multitudinous quality and incessant\nchange in the pictures, added to the occasionally frag-\nmentary nature (as of a mouth, nose, or eye only) of\nsome, and the fact of a process of formation being some-\ntimes observed, all point in this direction. And as to\nthe conditions of health, there is a common factor to\na state of over-fatigue, of exhilaration, and of fever, in\nthe velocity of the blood currents. So far as this ex-\nplanation agrees with the facts, its exponents have a\nvery strong case, and if it covered the whole field, we\nshould have to admit Sir David Brewster's dictum, that\n\" the mind's eye is the body's eye.\" An animal, then,\nwould bo just as liable to hypnagogic visions as a man,\nsince its eye is constructed in the same way ; the only\ndifference lying in the contents of the aforesaid minds\nrespectively. And everyone possessed of a normal eye\nat all, that is, the vast majority of the race, should\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hyptiagogic Phenomena 389\nbe as familiar -ndth hjrpnagogic pictures and \" faces in\nthe dark \" as they are with the sights of the external world.\n(2) The Mind's Eye.\u2014It is not pretended, even by the\nmost convinced holders of the retinal genesis of the pheno-\nmena, that the eye alone is sufficient, however richly provided\nwith picture-forming material, to account for the visions.\nThe foundation may be furnished by phosphenes and\ncorpuscles and so on, but the buUding requires another\nfactor for its construction : imagination. The materials\nfor this do not He in the eye-ball, which is only the\nouter terminus of the optic nerve, but must come down\nto it from some inner region. Thus Havelock Ellis says :\n^\n\" The eye suppHes entoptic glimmerings, and the brain,\nacting on the suggestions thus received, superposes mental\npictures to those ghmmermgs.\" Bergson has elaborated\nthis theory with respect to dream imagery, and Parish\nwas typical of the whole school in accepting such an\nexplanation on the ground that it was simpler than\nany other, and conformed to the law of parsimony. \" All\nfalse perception,\" he saj^s {op. cit. pp. 144, 148), \" is an\nanomalous reaction of the brain to sensory stimuli.\"\nWhat we popularly term imagination is in this view a\nre-presentation of images, the mental concomitant of the\nimpulse affecting a cell-group, or groups. Each might in\nthis way give rise to another, following the usual laws\nof association, and so bringing about a series of logically\nconnected pictures, though the Hnks between them might\nnot be apparent without a good deal of introspective\nanalysis. We should also expect in this case that memory\nwould be active and the scenes recognised, since they\nwould all be the calhng out of what had been actual\nperceptions at some time. Both these characteristics are\nmarkedly absent in the typical hypnagogic series.\nBut evidently the physiology of the brain ^ and of the\n^ The World of Dreams, p. 31. . : . .\n:\n^ Writers who may be consulted on this subject are : Dr. E.

Leaning.\noptic nerve in particular here comes into contact with\nthe findings of psychology, and the simpler theories have\nhad to yield to more complicated ones under the pressure\nof advancing research. It is not for an amateur like\nmyself to attempt an exposition of this intricate subject,\nbut Dr. C. S. Myers, whose Textbook of Experimental\nPsychology has been referred to before, sums up the\npresent position clearly.^ \" Evidence is gradually accumu-\nlating that before a sensation reaches its full development,\nit undergoes a process of compUcated elaboration, of the\ndetails of which, however, we are as yet totally ignorant.\nThis elaboration doubtless takes place at different stages\nand at different nervous levels in the cerebro-spinal system.\nAs psychologists we are by now far removed from the\ncrudities of the earlier physicists, who supposed that a\nwave of given length on reaching the retina immediately\nbecomes transformed into a sensation of colour and that\npsychical effects are identifiable with their external physical\ncauses. Nothing is more certain than that in addition\nto the more peripheral processes, central processes are\nalso involved in elaborating visual sensations. But at\npresent we are powerless to separate the one from the\nother ; we can only speak of changes in one vast un-\nravelled complex\u2014the cerebro-spinal apparatus.\" Such an\nadmission as this, in relation to normal seeing, is signifi-\ncant, and in strong contrast with the assurance of older\nwriters. It leads, by its mention of psychical effects,\ndirectly into a field where the mind is more and more\nand the body less. It is true that in the newly-recognised\n\" sub-conscious \" there is a popular tendency to find\nthat as \" simple \" a way of accounting for things as\never ; but the limit between definite knowledge and large\nassumption has still to be mai'ked out.\n(3) Another Vieiv.\u2014The counter theory to the retinal\ncausation, not only of hypnagogic but of all hallucinations,\nis one put forward by the leaders of psychical research,\nfew in number but cogent in presentation. It is that\nof central initiation, the impulse coming primarily from\n1 Pp. 99, 100.\n\fXciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Pheriomena 391\nwithin rather than from without, and Uable to originate\nin the penumbra of being which surrounds the Hmited\nfield of consciousness. The material may still have been,\nperhaps must have been, provided by the consciousness,\nwhether known or unknown to itself, but the finished\nproduct, in its novelty, its inexhaustible numbers, its\ncaprice, its oddity, its refractoriness to control, its qualities\nof various unexpectedness, its beauty and its unforeseen\nreactions on the spectator, all point to the brain as the\nlast term, and to somewhat else as the \" only begetter\n\"\nof the visions. It is these quahties which lead one\nperson to say \" an imaginative mind, working subcon-\nsciously \" makes the vision ^ while another says \" no\npossible approximation by imagination,\"\u2014that is, by the\nconscious imagination as exercised voluntarily by the\nbeholder. 2\nIt was, as Myers has pointed out, greatly to the credit\nof Sir John Herschel's penetrating mind that long before ^\nany theory of a subliminal or subconscious stratum had\nbeen formulated he should have felt his way, by means\nof his hjrpnagogic experience alone, to this solution.\n\" What are these geometrical spectra ?\n\" he asks, and\nreplies, not dreams, for the mind is active ; not retinal\nimpressions, or memory images, for \" memory does not\nproduce its effect by creating before the eyes a visible\npicture of the object remembered \" ; and goes on to\nreason that since the conception of a regular geometrical\npattern implies the exercise of thought and intelligence,\nwe have evidence here of \"a thought, an intelligence,\nworking within our own organisation distinct from that\nof our own personality.\" Nearly thirty years on * Gurney\nreferred to the same experiences as showing \" an immense\namount of high creative work\u2014of what in psychical terms\n1 S.

In the passing over\nthere is an increase of susceptibility to those elements\nwhich we possess but which do not find their way to con-\nsciousness in the waking state ; elements of \" high creative\nwork \" which can be relatively compared to the inspired\nmoments of genius.- Greenwood's experience supports this\nin a very high degree, and illustrates the theory he him-\nself deduced from it, that all the mental faculties are\n\" lifted into a higher range of freedom,\" and that among\nthem imagination is the teaching and revealing power.\nIn his case it was exceptionally so, for no one else has\nwritten of the countenances so forcibly, or has told us\nthat \" no human face that ever was seen, I am sure,\ndisplayed these emotions with a comparable fullness and\nintensity.\" More than one other writer has felt impressed\nwith the importance of the \" borderland \" visions in con-\nnection wdth studies of the secondary consciousness.'\nHyslop notes that he discovered by their disappearing\nabruptly instead of through real sleep that various func-\ntions of the mind may be associated and dissociated\nin different degrees, self-consciousness remaining \" when\nother senses and centres were evidently asleep.\" *\nH.

Secondly, that it is self-evident\nthat not being memories, nor things seen or previously\nimagined, they are mental constructs ; and thirdly, that\nthey are the work of a highly differentiated mental com-\npartment, without any apparent connection, emotional or\nvoMtional, with the aims, interests or feelings of the\nperson concerned. ^ ,. ,,.... \u201e\nXVII. The Application of Theory.\nWith this conclusion we evidently reach the opposite\nextreme to the theory of entoptic causation. What\nbecomes obvious, on a consideration of the whole range of\nhypnagogic phenomena is that they also present every\ngradation between the two interpretations. As conscious-\nness passes from the fully waking to the fully sleeping\nstate, every step, every change in the accompanying\nphenomena has been noted, some by one observer, some\nby another, and placing them in series we can get an idea\nof the process as a whole. In his analysis of visual\nactivities Myers ^ places upon the outward going line\n(terminating in physical sight) the \" entoptic glimmerings,\"\nand upon the inward going line (terminating in clairvoy-\nance) the hypnagogic visions, which he assigns as a\n\" marked and peculiar development \" of imagination-\nimages, placing below them only the simplest type of\ninternal vision, memory-images, and above them sublmiinal\nvisualisations such as the crystal makes objective. The\nemphatic way m which many hypnagogists distinguish\nbetween memory-images (which may be taken as the\nbase-line familiar to us all) between imagination-images\nor visualisations (in which some of them are weak),\nand again between entoptic glimmerings as such (\" ideo-\n\u00bbProc. Anier. S.P.R., Vol. III. p. G2'J.\n*Proc. S.P.R., Vol. VIII. pp. 528-533. Section xx. of the chapter -\non Sensory Automatism.\n\f394 F. E. Leaning. '\n[part\nretinal lights,\" sparks, flashes, etc.) and the hypnagogic\npictures, well support the place which Myers gives them,\nas does also the comparison with crystal-visions.\nThere is a second series of distinctions which observers\nnote. Mrs. Amold-Forster has drawn attention to the\nearher and later features of \" borderland \" sensations. It\nis clear that some people only know (or remember) the\nearlier, while others either pass too rapidly over them or\nare too much impressed by the later, to refer to them.\nTo this earlier stage we may attribute some of the\n\" process \" pictures which can be watched forming, which\nreproduce objects or scenes seen during the day, which\nare incomplete, lack movement, are less iUumined, in some\ncases not very distinct, and in particular have not the\nfeeling of reahty. People who say that they always knew\nthe pictures were subjective,^ or never mistook them for\nreality,\" or who refer to suggestions of the conscious im-\nagination hi connection with them,^ have to be taken as\nspeaking of this earlier stage only. So long as conscious-\nness is sufficiently in the ascendant to permit of the\nbeholder describing aloud what is passing, or actively\nvisualising known faces for purposes of comparison, and\nhe is able to say that hundreds of times he has\nsucceeded in seeing both at the same time, one in his eye,\nthe conjured-up one in his head,* it is clear from the\ndescriptions themselves that they are nearer the beginning\nof the hypnagogic period, and are likely therefore to owe\nbotli form and quality more to the entoptic gUmmerings\nand recent visual impressions than otherwise. The lowest\ndegree of internal sight, which precedes this and is over\nthe borderhne but only just over it, seems to be indicated\nby a writer^ who says: \"I have sometimes had the sen-\nsation of imaginary faces, etc., visualised before me without\nany corresponding impression on my eyes.\" That is, it is\nstill within the mind, unrelated to the eye or to space,\n^Jour. <S'.P.i?., Vol. IV. p. 277 (No. 2).\n'\n\"\n^ Galton's relative, Maury, and many others.\n5 Jour.

S.P.R., Vol. VIII. p. 295.\n\fxciv,] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 395\nand yet carrying something with it which indefinably\nseparates it from the memory and imagination images\nwhich lie adjacent to it.\nWhen the point has been insensibly reached which\ndivides the earher from the later stage, subliminal visuaHsa-\ntion comes into full play. Memory still registers freely,\nbut too much attention is fatal ;\nwatching, we are often\ntold, makes the picture disappear, perhaps because it is\nunconsciously productive of a slight muscular strain on the\neye which interferes with the necessary passivity. The\npictures are now markedly different and superior, so that\nthe various observers ^ have commented on the two kinds\nthat occur. They are seen as instantaneously complete,\nvivid in light and colour, more abundant in detail, and\ndisplaying movement within themselves (as distinct from\nchange of subject-matter, which goes on all the time).\nOne hypnagogist has remarked that movement never takes\nplace while he is sufficiently awake to remember it ; and\nanother, that the nearer to sleep the more vivid and\nliving the picture becomes. Most significant of all is a\ndifference of quahty in the seeing. It is possible that the\nhigh illumination, the richness of colouring, and the life-\nmovement are inherent in the pictures themselves ; but\nthe extreme distinctness, coupled with the miniature scale\nso often prevalent,'' lead by more than inference to the\nconclusion that internal sight is superior to either the\nphysical or mental as known to ordinary consciousness.\nThe \" highly differentiated mental compartment \" whence\nthe pictures proceed is furnished with an eye of its own,\nan eye which sees behind as well as before, and is other-\nwise the fitting instrument for the enjoyment of that\n\"immense amount of high creative work\" which Gurney\nconsidered the hypnagogic experiences to bear witness to.\niMr. Fielding-Ould, Mr. J. W. Macdonald, Miss Ida Wild, S. M. B.,\nand see footnote (5) supra, p. 394.\n^ When this paper was read at a private meeting of the S.P.R., on\nOct. 24, 1923, a member present spoke of having seen whole regiments\nof soldiers no larger than pins' heads, but that every button and detail\nwas distinct. For the pinhead comparison cf. Phrenological Journal, vol,\nV, p. 319 ; quoted by McNish, p. 267, see p. 333,\n\f396 7^. E. Leaning. [part\nAnd whether we regard them as incipient materialisations,\nas face-formation would suggest, or as clairvoyant faculty\nin some degree, as the comparison with crystal visions\nwould suggest, we have in either case evidence of \"a\nthought, an intelligence, working within our own organisa-\ntion, distinct from our own personality,\" but presenting us\nwith a means of studying it not to be despised.\nXVIII. The Interior Vision : Its Mechanism.\nWe locate the sight of the eye in the retina, its trans-\nlation into intelligible units of perception in the various\ncentres of the brain, visual concepts and their manipulation\nin the highest cerebral areas, but where can we locate the\norgan of vision beyond either of these ? It is of a third\norder which is even less related to the physical than that\nis to the mental, but the most the observer can do is\noften only to state that he is using neither of these, but\nthat his inward vision \" is quite different \" from both.\nStead, for instance, after his two visions adds : \"I saw all\nthat without opening my eyes, nor did my eyes have\nanything to do with it. You see such things as these, as\nit were, with another sense which is more inside your head\nthan in your eyes. This experience enabled me to under-\nstand better how it was that clairvoyants see than any\namount of disquisition. The pictures . . . simply came as\nif I had been able to look through a glass at what was\noccurring somewhere else in the world.\" Another hypna-\ngogist,! who had frequent but not regular experience,\nafter contrasting the results of voluntary imaginings and\nprolonged attention, says that both these are in the brain,\nbut the others distinctly not so. Where people speak of\nseeing under their eyelids, or in the closed eye, it is some-\ntimes obviously a figure of speech, because they will at\nthe same time assign a given distance to the objects seen.\nGreenwood, for example, uses the former expression, but\nalso says the faces were usually five or six feet away.\nAnother speaks of two feet of distance, or of their being\n\" suffocatingly close,\" or \" Life-size and close to the eyes,\"\nI St. James s Gazette, Feb, 15, 1882,\n\fxciv.] Introductory StwJy of Hypnagogic Phenomena 397\nand so on, which can only mean that if they were seen as\nobjects in the external world they would occupy relatively\nthat space or position. Where -this is appUed to faces,\nwe may have an external objective basis for it, but other-\nwise we have here the interpretation by the conscious mind\nof a product of the subconscious, which, as far as given\nin immediate experience, must be out of relation to any\nspatial conditions ; an interpretation such as is continuously\napphed to the minute record by the retinae of the outer\nworld round us. Thus a careful hj^Dnagogic recorder ^\nsays that the landscapes she sees apparentlj^ mside her\nhead are not on the closed eyehds, and are \" perceived by\nsomething within,\" just as Stead says. And it seems that\nthis \" something within \" is not only to be taken as\n\"more inside your head,\" but within as related to con-\nsciousness. J\nThe existence of a function impUes, if it does not\ncreate, the organ whicli it uses, and the conception of\nevolution implies a successive development of organs to\nserve the widening response of the creature to its environ-\nment. Professor Arthur Keith has said recently ^ that\nnew human characters are foreshadowed in developmental\nstages passed through by the yoang of anthropoid apes.\nWhether young apes have hypnagogic visions we cannot\nteU, but we see that our own young have them ; that\nthey are transitional, passing away with youth ; and that\nin the smaU proportion who preserve the power, it acts\nintermittentlj'. AU this is in accordance -^vith the gradual\ndevelopment of a new characteristic. Evidence that some\nsuch thing exists, some specifically visual form of crypt-\nsesthesia, say, is recognised in all clairvoyant experience ; and\nthough this is not the place to enlarge upon that, it may\nbe permitted to indicate the directions in which a nucleus\nof facts exists that bear upon the point.\nWe have then : (a) The physiological fact of a pineal\ngland. ' the function of which, if it have any, is whoUy\nunknown, but which, as the remains of a Cyclopean eye\niJowr.

S.P.R., Vol. V. p. 520,\nfootnote) ; Warcollier's subject had only a strong inclination to sleep.\nThese are, however, the only cases of the kind I can find. WarcoUier\nhimself {La Telipathie, p. 79) localises his illusions in the prefrontal\nregion, at the root of the nose, and the optjc thalamus (\" a I'entrecroise-.\nment des nerfs opticjues \"),\n\fxciv.] Introductory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 399\noccultism, showing the agreement between widely separated\nwitnesses. \" A somnambule,\" says the first of these\/ \" on\nbeing asked what she saw (i.e. of the internal parts of the\nbody) answered '\nAll that I will, except the stomach, and\npart of the forehead above the nose, with which the ray of\nperception proceeding from the stomach is in connection.'\n\"\nMy correspondent declares that she has \" twice seen in\nliving human beings a third eye in the centre of the fore-\nhead \" ; and Mr. Cyril Scott writes 2 that \" Trained clair-\nvoyants are conscious of a certain activity . . . between the\neyes, just above the bridge of the nose.\"\nThese items may seem to form a somewhat miscellaneous\nand bizarre group, but they admit of being synthesized,\nin the direction of an organ of clairvoyance situated on\nthe median line,^ capricious in its action, not taking kindly\nto the simultaneous activity of the physical eye (hence\ntears, sense of pressure, etc.) perhaps on account of the\ndraw on nervous energy, less disturbed by mental visual-\nisation, but at its best when brain and eye and mind are\nmost quiescent, and capable of being excited or developed\nby conscious practices directed towards that end. So far,\nits appearance in the hypnagogic state ; but if a wider\nview, embracing mesmeric and hypnotic phenomena, natural\nsomnambuHsm, and vision-producing drugs, were taken into\nconsideration, possibly much more could be adduced.\nXIX. Sources Discussed.\nWe have considered so far two of the main aspects\npresented by hypnagogic phenomena : that is, what people\nsee, which is easy and for which we have a fair amount\nof data, and how they see, which is more problematical\nand for which we have conflicting and scanty data only.\nA third question is, whence come the things they see ? and\n^ Du Prel, Dr. C, Philosophy of Mysticism, vol. i. p. 227, quoting\nKieser in Archiv fur den Thierischen Magnetismus, vol. iv. pp. 2, 272.\n2 Occult Review (May 1916), p. 269.\n^ See Baraduc, H., Les Vibrations de la Vitalite Hmnaine (Paris, 1904),\nPlates VII., XIII., XXI., etc., and Prof. Alrutz's experiments in Proc,\nS^^P.fi., Vol, XXXII. p. 159.\n\f400 F. E. Leaning: '\nv. -' - [part\nthis is but little more satisfactory than the second. Almost\nthe only light we have on the subject is by the analogous\nbut more developed phenomena of the crystal visions,\nwhich have a probably wider range than the personal life\nof the scryer alone would provide. That range includes\nthe mental images in other minds, and the only corres-\nponding hj^nagogic experiences (which are the result of\nexperimental methods) have been contributed by M. War-\ncollier. All other experiments had been in the direction\nof volitional control, or else auto-suggestion, the percipient\nacting practically as his own agent. But it occurred to\nM. WarcoUier to enlist someone else as agent, when he\nhimself was in the suggestible hypnagogic condition. There\nwere difficulties and drawbacks, such as, in some cases, an\nill-chosen hour, or a pressure of affairs, or the weariness\nand even illness of one or other of the persons concerned.\nYet with praiseworthy perseverance he continued over a\nperiod of some three years, not always with the same\nagent, and tabulated and analysed the results. Obviously\nthis was a species of thought-transference ; and it had the\ndisadvantages which always accompany such experiments ;\nthat is, it involved dehberate action at a fixed hour and\ncorresponding expectation. Wherever conscious direction\nof the mental faculties takes place there is a gain in\nprecision and a loss in richness of content ; the \" high\ncreative work \" in which the unshackled subliminal\nimagination freely indulges suffers serious limitation and\nimpoverishment. But true telepathy, in the form of spon-\ntaneous impressions, sometimes managed to mingle with\nthe intended messages ; its presence was proved in the\nform of that \" perversity \" which has previously been\nreferred to. Thus M. B., acting as agent, had the curious\nidea of trying to transmit attitudes simultaneously with\nideas, and on a Sunday morning ^ placed himself at the\nappointed time, 7.0 a.m., in a position of devotion in an\narm chair, concentrating his mind on the word prayer.\nBut what his friend received was the picture of a curtain\n^ La Telepathie, p. 222. The whole of chap, vii., as well as part of\nchap, iii., deals expressly with the hypnagogic period, but the author\nadmits that the results of his experience are mediocre (p. 191).\n\fxciv.] Iniroduciory Study of Hypnagogic Phenomena 401\nin heavy dark material, red predominating, and caught\nback by a tie ; also the number 14, as though written on\na blackboard. Now there was just such a curtain in a\ndoorway in M. B.'s room, and the number of the room\nwas 14. M. B. was certainly not thinldng of this at the\ntime, nor regarding the curtain, for his eyes were cast up\n\" au del.'\" In the series in which this took place (the\nfifth) there were twelve trials, and the proportion of suc-\ncesses was twenty per cent. ;\nin the second series there\nwere twenty-two trials and no results at all. This in-\nequality with different agents makes a general percentage\non the whole very misleading ;\nand, in any case, however\nlarge a proportion of successes or coincidences might occur,\nit does not prove that where there is a vision there is an\nunknown agent producing it. On the other hand, we\nknow that the susceptible subconscious mind can pick up\nvisual images of all sorts from the mental atmosphere of\nits neighbours, and that the remotest link is sometimes\nsufficient to enable it to do so. Thus some of the unre-\ncognised scenes, at least, may have such a source ; al-\nthough the amount of detail and the supreme distinctness\nwith which they are seen seem less likely to admit of\ntheir being merely derived from some one else's mental\nimages than of their being derived from the actual\nscenes themselves. And the panoramic type of moving\npicture is most of all like reahty. IVIr. de Bray has\npropoimded the idea that everyone's brain is producing\na stream of pictures all the time, which become visible in\nthe hypnagogic state ; but this reasoning rests on the\nrather slender ground that some people\u2014one in three, if\nour calculation be correct\u2014sometimes see the pictures, and\nthat only at undefined periods and not continuously ; and\nyet all men everywhere are certainly drowsy at least once\na day. A very large number of visions, either of this\nsort or as a series of detached objects, must certainly be\nput down to subconscious memory, partly in view of the\nfact that at every waking hour since our birth scenes of\nsome sort have been in progress before us, and with the\npower to comprehend pictures (in books and elsewhere)\n^nd later on, to visualise the thousand descriptive scenes\n\f402 F. E. Leaning. [part\nin fiction, travels, and so on, the number is increased\npossibly to millions. Where these records are\u2014whether as\nolder physiologists think they are somehow packed up in\nthe cells of the brain, or whether that is not, on any\ncomputation, an inadequate hypothesis, as some think ^\n\u2014\nwe cannot prove. But wherever the mental workshop is,\nthere the mental warehouse must be from which the\nmaterials are drawn, and there also is the unknown work-\nman who selects the brilliant, the pleasing, or the surpris-\ning elements which entertain the every-day consciousness\nof the owner. \u2022\n^ .-.\nIt is surely the same source whence proceed the artistic,\nor literary, or intellectual inspirations which are reported\nto have occurred in dreams occasionally. The only instance\nwhich can fairly be ranked with these as definitely hypna-\ngogic is that of Kekule's vision of the dance of the atoms,\n^\nas he rode home late at night from Islington to Clapham\non the top of an omnibus. He says that he fell into a\nreverie and saw the atoms gambolling before his eyes.\nOn a second occasion he was sitting dozing by his study\nfire and tells iis that his mental eye, rendered more acute\nby repeated visions of the kind, could now distinguish\nlarger structures ; and in this condition he beheld further\nand more elaborate combinations, long rows turning and\ntwisting Avith snake-like motion, and the comprehension of\na further theory of molecular construction struck him so\nforcibly that he says \" as if by a flash of lightning I\nawoke.\" It is the hypnagogic rather than the actual\ndream state that is indicated by this sudden return to\nconsciousness under the impact of an idea. But it must\nbe admitted that in the case of a scientist whose mind was\ncontinually occupied with the problems proper to it, as in\nthis instance we know it to have been, a good deal of\nsubconscious incubation inust have taken place, and the\nrecognition of the residts is rather to be attributed to that\nthan to anything in the nature of clairvoyance.\n* See on this subject a penetrating article by H. F. Saltmarsh, \" Neuro-\ngrams and Specific Response,\" in Psyche, vol. iii. (n.s.), p. .328 (April 1923).\n^ Kekiile Memorial Lecture, Jour. Chem.. Soc, Feb. 1898 ; but the inci-\ndent is quoted in Proc. Amer. S.P.R., Vol. III. p. 672 (footnote).\n\fxciv. I\nInlrodudory Study uf Hypmigogic PheiioUiena 4o3\nIn all discussiona uf these phenomena by persons who\nexamme and illustrate them from their own experience,\nthe theory held by them must be taken into account.\nThey will inevitably tend to remember and emphasise\nthose elements which support the theorj^ and to accept\nsuch in the experience of others, while passively ignoring\nothers which do not lend themselves to a certain inter-\npretation. And for this reason it is better to make a study\nof all those accounts provided by people who have no\ntheory at all, but merely describe carefully what they see.\nIf, as I conclude, there is in hypnagogic experiences a\ncomplex interplay of physical, psychological, and psychic\nfactors combined, their study is an open door to all of\nthese alike, but more particularly the last, as having\nreceived so much less attention hitherto.\nMy acknowledgements are due to the Council of the\nS.P.R. for permission to quote certain passages from the\nJournal, and to all those members of the Society who have\ngiven me assistance and advice ; also to the Editor of\nLight, to numerous readers and private correspondents, and\nto Miss Estelle Stead.\n\fXX.

F. BARRETT, F.R.S.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART XCV.\nIN MEMORY OF\nSIR WILLIAM FLETCHER BARRETT, F.R.S.\nIn the death of Sir WiEiam Barrett, which occurred\nquite suddenly on May 26th, at the age of 81, our Society\nhas to mourn the loss of one of its past presidents and\nthe last remaining member of its original Council. He was,\nmoreover, not only a member of the first Council but\nvery definitely a founder of the Society\u2014^one may say the\nfounder, for I believe the first idea of founding a Society\nat aU was his. It was the stimulating efi^ect of his zeal\nand energy that largely influenced Sidgwick, Myers and\nGumey to renewed interest in investigations in which\nthey, like himself, had done a considerable amount of\nwork in previous years, though often with disappointing\nresults. I remember his coming to Cambridge and reading\nto us a large budget of cases, experimental and spontan-\neous, collected by himself (largely by means of appeals\nthrough the press) and pointing to what we now call\ntelepathy.^ This must, I think, have been in the autumn\nof 1881 and the visit was, I suspect, the occasion of\nSidgwick's writing to a friend on Sept. 4th, 1881, \" The\ngreat event that has occurred to me is that my interest\nin Spiritualism has been revived.\" The formation of a\n^ He had appealed for \"trustworthy evidence ... of cases of the direct\naction of one mind upon another giving rise to an apparent transfusion\nof thought or feeling ... or of cases where . . . perception may seeiu\nto occur independent of the ordinary channels of sensation,\"\n\f414 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick. [part\nSociety was under consideration that autumn and winter,\nand Professor Barrett, as he then was, was engaged in\nstirring up interest in the idea in various quarters. It\nwas he who enhsted in its favour Professor Balfour\nStewart and, directly or indirectly, other distinguished\nearly members, as well as some of the leading Spiritualists\nof the time. As Professor Balfour Stewart said in his\nPresidential address m 1885 when givmg a brief survey\nof the growth of the Society, \" A prelimmary conference\nwas convened by Professor Barrett (whom we honour as\nour founder) on the 5th and 6th of January 1882 . . .\nThe Society was next formally constituted on the 20th of\nFebruary.\" Though it was decided that Professor Sidg-\nwick should be the first President, Sir William Barrett\nwas naturally made a Vice-President, and it was he who,\nin the capacity of honorary secretary to the committee\non Thought Readmg, read at the first general meeting\nthe first paper contributed to the Society and published\nin its Proceedings.\nHis interest has continued unabated ever since. He\nhas been a diligent attendant at meetings of the Council,\nnotwithstanding the distance he had to travel when\nProfessor of Physics at the Royal College of Science for\nDublin\u2014a position he held from 1873 to 1910\u2014and\nnotwithstandmg the strain which his increasing deafness\nmust of late years have put on him in discussions ; and\nhe has been the moving spirit m various developments of\nthe Society's work and organisation. Thus in February\n1884, the Journal was started on his proposal as a means\nof communication between the Council and the members\nand associates of the Society, as well as of members with\neach other ; and for the first year of its existence he\nacted as editor.\nIn the same year Professor Barrett, drawn to America\nby the meeting of the British Association at Montreal,\nwas able to interest important men of science m the\nUnited States in psychical research and to give the im-\npetus required for the foundation of a Society for Psychical\nResearch there. It was estabhshed in January 1885 with\nProfessor Simon Newcomb as its first President. Sir\n\fxcv.] Sir William Fletcher Barrett. 415\nWilliam Barrett's own account of the work he did so\nsuccessfully in actively interesting people sufficiently to\nbring about this result may be found in the first volume\nof our Journal (pp. 172-6). He mamtamed his interest\nin the work on the other side of the Atlantic to the\nend of his life, corresponding on the subject with friends\nand fellow workers both in the United States and in\nCanada. Recently he has taken a keen personal interest\nin the foundation and prospects of the new Boston\nSociety.\nHis never-failing desire to stimulate interest in psychical\nresearch and promote associations for collective inquiry\nwas manifested on the very day he died by his taking\nthe chair at a group meeting in the Society's rooms,\narranged by Mr. Trethewy, with a view to \" collecting\ninformation about the practice of Spiritualism in foreign\ncountries.\"\nIn earlier days, before the foundation of the Society,\nit was this same desire to interest the world in the\nsubject of our inquiry and to draw other workers into\nthis field of investigation, which prompted him to read a\npaper about it before the British Association at Glasgow\nin 1876, in which he urged the formation of a committee\nof the Association to examine the evidence for the reality\nof the alleged phenomena. It annoyed some men of\nscience a good deal at the time, and excited somewhat\nviolent controversy in the Press. But it undoubtedly had\na considerable effect in promoting the interest in psychical\nresearch which its author desired to create.\nThere can be no doubt that Sir William Barrett had\nin a remarkable degree a power of stirring up in others\ninterest in subjects which interested himself. Both in\nconversation and as a lecturer he was very successful\nin this, not only in psychical research, but also, I\nbelieve, in experimental physics, the subject with which\nhe was professionally engaged during the greater part of\nhis life. He had considerable power of exposition, both\nas a lecturer and as a writer. His style in writing is\nlucid and pleasant, and his arrangement of his matter\nclear and instructive. His little book on Psychical\n\f416 Eleanor Mildred Sidgivick. [part\nResearch, in the Home University Library, though neces-\nsarily somewhat out of date now, is a model for brief\nbut clear and popular treatment of a complicated subject,\nand he produced several other books connected with our\nwork.^\nBut I think what most gave him force as a kind of\nprophet was his great eagerness to stimulate enquiry and\nto interest people, with an instinctive perception of what\nwould generally interest them. Eagerness such as his had,\nof course, its drawbacks, and may have sometimes caused\nhim to bring forward interesting cases before they had\nbeen fully investigated and made as complete evidentially\nas possible. But, on the other hand, his keenness brought\nhim into touch with cases which we might not otherwise\nhave heard of, and enabled him to stimulate and en-\ncourage friends to carry out experiments which might not\notherwise have taken place. It was, for instance, partly\ndue to his encouragement that Miss Ramsden and Miss\nMiles carried out their valuable experiments in telepathy\nat a distance.\nI am not attempting to give any history of Sir William's\ninterest in Psychical Research or of the work in it done\nby him, for he himself told us about it in the paper he\nread to the Society less than a year ago\u2014ia June 1924\n\u2014\non \" Some Reminiscences of Fifty Years of Psychical\nResearch,\" ^ and what I should have to say would be\nlargely repetition. But a few words should be said of\nhis scientific work unconnected with psychical research.\nHe was, as he in fact tells us in the paper just referred\nto, Tyndall's assistant for several years (1862-1867), and\nit was in Tjudall's laboratory at the Royal Institution\nthat his well-known observations on sensitive flames were\nfirst made. Later in his own laboratory at Dublin he\nmade other investigations and discoveries. Among them\nwere discoveries of alloys of iron, at least one of which\nhas proved of great value. He also made observations\non the curious behaviour of iron near the critical magnetic\n1 On the Threshold of a New World of Thought, 1908 ; On Creative\nThought, 1910 ; A Study of Swedenhorg, 1912.\n^ Proceedingn , vol. xxxiv. p. 275\n\fxcv.] Sir William Fletcher Barrett. 417\npoint and investigations into entoptic vision. He was\nelected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1899.\nSir William's contributions to our Proceedings and\nJournal have been numerous, and deal with many, indeed\nmost, departments of psychical research. Hypnotism,\nTelepathy and Telergy, the physical phenomena of Spirit-\nualism, Poltergeists, \" Reichenbach phenomena \" with the\npossibility of a magnetic sense, supernormal communication\nthrough motor automatism, all claimed his attention.\nHis longest and probably most important papers in Pro-\nceedings are the two On the so called Divining Bod,\npublished in Volumes XIII. and XV. They constitute a\ntreatise on the subject and have made him an authority\non it. In 1900 his provisional conclusion from these in-\nvestigations (expressed in Vol. XV., p. 311) was that the\ndowser's success arises \" from some kind of transcendental\ndiscernment possessed by his subconscious self\n\"\u2014from\nclairvoyance in fact\u2014which through subliminal suggestion\ncauses the automatic muscular contractions that move the\ndowsing rod. This provisional conclusion seems to have\ndeveloped through further reflection into a firm conviction ;\nand last year, in the \" Reminiscences \" already referred\nto, he says \" I believe that it [i.e. dowsing] affords the\neasiest and most conclusive evidence that a supernormal\nperceptive power\u2014akin to clairvoyance\u2014exists.\" We under-\nstand, however, that search is still bemg made in Germany\nfor normal physical or physiological explanations of the\nphenomena of dowsing.\nOn May 6th, at the last meeting of the Society before\nhis death, Sir WiUiam was the reader of a paper \" On\nan Enquiry into a Remarkable Case,\" and the Journal\nfor May which appeared almost on the day of his death\ncontains an obituary notice of Dr. Sydney Alrutz of Upsala,\nin whose work in hypnotism he took great interest. He\ndied, therefore, as he would have wished, very much in\nharness\u2014working for psychical research to the last.\nIn his private life Sir William Barrett was a man of\nwarm and enduring friendships. He had a devoted sister\nwho kept house for him for many years, and his latest\nyears were rendered very happy by his marriage in 1916\n\f418 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwich. [part\nto Mrs. Florence Willie, M.D., the distinguished surgeon\nand gynecologist.\nIn conclusion, it only remains to say, that those of us\nwho, like myself, believe that our Society has been and\nis a valuable instrument in promoting investigation in\nfields neglected by orthodox science cannot but feel much\ngratitude to Sir WiUiam Barrett to whom its existence\nis so largelj^ due, and who also began \" the accumula-\ntion of evidence which bids fair sooner or later to place\ntelepathy among the established truths of science.\" When\nthat forecast, quoted from his Presidential address to the\nSociety in 1904,'^ comes true, as I cannot doubt it will,\nSir William Barrett will undoubtedly and deservedly be\nregarded as a courageous pioneer in jDerhaps the most im-\nportant branch of human discovery.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n'\nProceedingf!, vol. xviii., pp. 241-2.\n\fxcv.] Monsieur Camille Flammanon. 419\nIN MEMORY OF\nMONSIEUR CAMILLE FLAMMARION.\nWe have to record with great regret the loss of another\nformer President of the Society, also a well-known man\nof science, in the death of Monsieiir Camille Flammarion,\nwhich occurred at Juvisy on June 4, 1925, at the age of\neighty-three. In the forty-three years of its existence\nthe Society has had four Presidents who were distinguished\ncitizens of foreign countries ; one American, William James,\nand three Frenchmen, Professor Charles Richet, Professor\nHenri Bergson, and lastly Camille Flammarion, whom we\nwelcomed not only for his own sake, but as strengthening\nthe ties that already bound us to our fellow-workers in\nFrance.\nMonsieur Flammarion has already described in his\nPresidential Address {Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XXXIV., p. 1)\nhow it was in 1861, sixty-four years ago, that his interest\nin psychical research was first stimulated by seeing on\na Paris book-stall Alan Kardec's Le Livre des Esprits.\nFrom that time till the end of his life Ms interest never\nflagged and he became the author of several widely-read\nbooks on the subject. It was, however, to the study of\nastronomy that his life was mainly devoted. He excelled\nespecially in setting forth the results of astronomical\nresearch in a lucid and attractive style, intelligible to\nthose who have little or no technical knowledge of the\nsubject. The writer of the Obituary Notice in the\nTimes said of him :\n\" He was indeed aptly named '\nThe\nPoet of the Heavens,' and was regarded with real affection\nby immense numbers of readers, both in France and\nEngland, who owed to him aU their knowledge of the\nwonders of astronomy.\" Something of his power of\nbringing within the vision of the ordinary man the\n\f420 Monsieur Camille Flammarion. [pabT\nimmense vistas which astronomy opens out may be felt in\nhis Presidential Address to this Society. An English\ntranslation of the Address was, as many of our members\nwill recollect, read at a General Meeting of the Society\non June 26, 1923, by Sir William Barrett, who had been\nfor many years on terms of personal friendship with\nMonsieur Flammarion.\nTo the Society's Journal for March, 1923 (Vol. XXI.,\np. 45), shortly after the election of Monsieur Flammarion\nas President, Sir William Barrett contributed an account\nof his work, from which the following passages may be\nquoted here :\nIn spite of his great age, he will be 82 years old in a\nfew weeks, his intellectual activity is undiminished. Few,\nif an}', scientific men have written so many books, each\ncharacterised by great and wide learning and that wonder-\nful lucidity in which French savants excel. His last\ntreatise, now in course of publication, is on psychical\nresearch, and entitled La Mort et son Mystere, and is\ndivided into three volumes, viz. 1. Avant la Mort ; 2.\nAtitour de la Mort ; and 3. Apres la Mort . . .\nOn the fly-leaf of Apres la Mort is given a list of some\nof the many psychical works M. Flammarion has published.\nHis best-known book is Ulnconnu et les problemes psychi-\nques, . . . But although M. Flammarion has been studying\npsychical phenomena for fifty years his life work has been\nastronomy, and his papers and books on this subject have\nhad an immense circulation ;\ne.g. his small volume entitled\nLumen has reached a circulation of 70,000, and his Reves\n\u00a3toiles no less than 142,000. Besides these he has pub-\nlished at least twenty works on astronomy, most of which\nare intended to bring the wonders of the heavens and the\nresults of modern astronomical research within the com-\nprehension of the general public. In addition he has\npublished sixteen books on general science, of which his\nUAtmosphere, a popular treatise on meteorology, is the\nbest laiown. Then he has written at least half-a-dozen\nbooks on speculative science and philosophy, such as La\npluralite des mondes habites, La fin du monde, etc.\n\fxcv.] Monsieur Camille Flarufnarion. 421\nBut all this monumental labour has been subsidiary to\nhis work at the Observatory of Juvisy, which he founded\nin 1883 and still superintends. The resume of his astrono-\nmical observations and papers fills two pages of the\nmemorial to him in the Bulletin de la SociSte Astronomique\nde France, and to these labours must be added the editing\nof a monthly astronomical review which M. Flammarion\nfounded in 1882. With such a wonderful record of\nscientific work there is little wonder that last year the\nCouncil of the French Astronomical Society held a public\nmeeting to celebrate the 80th anniversary of M. Flam-\nmarion's birth. At this meeting the great amphitheatre\nof the Sorbonne, Avhich holds 3000 persons, was found\ntoo small for the multitude who wished to join in this\nmagnificent celebration. ...\nOwing to his great age and to his other pre -occupations\nMonsieur Flammarion was not able to attend any meetings\nof the Society during his year of Office as President, and but\nfew of our Members can have had any personal acquaint-\nance with him. But an impression of his vigorous and\nalert personality can be gathered from the photograph\nwhich was reproduced as a frontispiece to Vol. XXXIV.\nof the Proceedings.\n\f422 Professor Charles Richet. [PAET\nDES CONDITIONS DE LA CERTITUDE.\nPar M. Charles Richet, Propesseur a\nL'Universite de Paris.\nEn vous parlant des conditions de la certitude, il semble\ntout d'abord que je sois bien loin de I'objet de vos etudes.\nPourtant je vous connais. Je sais quelles sont vos actives\npreoccupations. Je me soQviens encore avec emotion de\nI'accueil favorable que vous m'avez accorde quand, il y a\ndeja vingt ans, j'eus, grace a votre bienveillance, I'honneur\nd'etre nomme votre President. Alors\u2014vous vous le rap-\npelez peut-etre\u2014en mon adresse presidentielle, je n'hesitai\npas a jeter dans le monde ce mot de metapsychique qui a\nfait depuis quelque fortune. Aussi bien restais-je ce jour\nla tout a fait au coeur de vos anxietes scientifiques\nspeciales.\nOr, aujourd'liui, en parlant des conditions psychologiques\nde la certitude, il parait a premiere vue que je m'ecarte\ndes sujets que vous abordez d'ordinaire. Cependant il n'en\nest rien. Meme, plus je reflechis, plus je me persuade que\nce qui domine notre science\u2014car nous avons tous ici la\npretention d'appeler la metapsychique une science\u2014c'est\nde posseder la notion precise de ce qu'il convient d'appeler\nla certitude.\nJe n'aurai garde d'ailleurs de traiter la question autre-\nment qu'a notre point de vue particulier. Je n'ignore pas\nen effet que de grands philosophes ont ecrit sur la certitude\ndes livres profonds, et imagine de savantes theories, depuis\nSocrate jusqu'a Descartes, depuis Berkeley jusqu'a Kant,\ndepuis Auguste Comte jusqu'a Bergson, mon illustre ami,\nun de vos anciens presidents.\nJe me proposerai seulement d'etudier comment et dans\nquelles conditions nous pouvons arriver en science meta-\npsychique a acquerir la certitude.\n\fxcv.] I)es Conditioyis de la Certitude. 423\n\u00a7 I. Il est des Degbbs dans la Certitude.\nTout de suite, une premiere proposition est a etablir,\nqui parait paradoxale, mais qui cependant, j'espere, ne\nvous paraitra pas contestable ; c'est qu'il n'y a pas une\ncertitude, mais des certitudes tres diverses. Autrement dit,\nla certitude comporte des degres. Maintes verites que\nnous regardons comme certaines, et meme absolument\ncertaines, se presentent a nous avec quelque hierarchie\ndans cette certitude meme.\nBien entendu la certitude ne peut^pasj porter sur les\njugements, et les appreciations, mais sur les faits. Notre\nopinion sur les bienfaits ou les mefaits de Napoleon, de\nLouis XIV, de Frederic II, est sujette a de teUes con-\ntroverses qu'il n'y a pas de certitude. De meme pour\nles arts. Quoique Rembrandt me paraisse bien superieur\na Guido Reni, la superiorite de Rembrandt n'est pas une\ncertitude ;\npas plus que la superiorite de Shakespeare sur\nWalter Scott.\nII ne peut y avoir de certitude ni dans les arts, ni dans\nla politique ; ni meme, helas ! dans nos jugements sur les\nhommes.\nII s'agit seulement de la certitude des faits. Pour\nprendre un exemple simple, j'examinerai les verites elemen-\ntaires du calcul des probabiiites. Mathematiquement, ane\nprobabilite tres faible n'est jamais une certitude, mais\nrnoralement il n'en est pas ainsi. La certitude morale,\ncomme on dit, ne correspond pas du tout a la certitude\nmathematique. Quand la probabiUte est extremement\nfaible, la certitude du cas contraire devient extremement\nforte, et rnoralement presque absolue. Au jeu de la\nroulette, par exemple, la probabilite que la rouge va sortir\ncinquante fois de suite est tres faible (^)^\u00b0, c'est-a-dire a\nP^\u00ae^ ioo.oou!\"ouo.ouo -\nJ\u00ae ^^^^ ^ P\u00ae^ P^\u00ae^ certain,\net meme tout a fait certain, que la rouge ne va pas\nsortir 50 fois de suite. On ne I'a jamais vu. On n'a\nmeme quelque chance de voir cette extraordinaire serie que\nsi Ton joue 100 milliards de parties. Et cependant la\ncertitude n'est pas absolue. D'abord parce q\\ie je peux\ntomber sur cette faible chance, mais surtout parce qu'il\n\f424 Professor Charles Richet. [part\ns'agit d'une machine humaine, machine qui est mise en\nmouvement par des hommes, machine qui n'est pas ideale-\nment parfaite, et qui par consequent comporte un defaut\ntel qu'elle va surtout donner des boules rouges.\nD'ailleurs il est evident qu'avant le cinquantieme coup,\nquand il y a deja 49 rouges, j'ai exactement autant de\nchances d' avoir 49 rouges, plus une noire, que 50 rouges.\nC'est au commencement de la partie qu'on peut affirmer\nen presque absolue certitude qu'on n'obtiendra pas 50\nboules rouges consecutives.\nEt tout de suite nous voyons qu'U y a des degres dans\nla certitude. Car si, au lieu de dire 50 boules rouges, j' avals\ndit 500 boules rouges, la certitude que je ne rencontrerai\npas une serie de 500 boules rouges deviendrait enormement\nplus forte que la certitude de n'avoir pas une s^rie de 50\nrouges. On est moralement certain qu'on n'aura pas 50\nrouges consecutives, mais plus certain encore qu'on n'en\naura pas 500. On n'aura d'ailleurs jamais la certitude\nmathematique, mais seulement la certitude morale.\nDe fait, dans toutes les sciences, math^matiques ou\nautres, et dans la pratique habituelle de la vie, nous nous\ncontentons pour notre certitude de probabilites bien moins\nfaibles que ou meme {\\f'', ou meme (-|)^\".\nMais je ne veux pas prolonger cette discussion qui nous\nentrainerait trop loin. Je reviendrai d'aUleurs sur I'appU-\ncation du calcul des probabilites a nos recherches. Pour le\nmoment, je donnerai d'autres exemples, afin d'etablir que,\nmeme lorsqu'il n'est pas question de hasard, il y a des\ndegres dans la certitude, et je chercherai a savoir pourquoi.\nJe viens de Paris et je suis a Londres. J'ai la certitude\nabsolue que Paris et Londres sont des vUles reelles.\nQuoique je n'aie vu ni Calcutta, ni Sumatra, ni Valparaiso,\nje suis tout aussi certain que ces viUes lointaines existent.\nDes vaisseaux en arrivent chaque jour, avec des lettres, des\npassagers, des marchandises. On peut y envoyer ou en\nrecevoir des telegrammes. La certitude est complete.\nJe ne suis pas moins certain que Carthage a existe.

C'est un fait\nd'absolue certitude, et le revoquer en doute ce serait nier\ntoute I'histoire ancienne. Cependant, quelque certaine que\nsoit la realite de I'ancienne Carthage, ma certitude relative\na Carthage est un peu moindre que ma certitude relative a\nCalcutta, car pour Carthage je suis force de m'en rapporter\na des temoignages historiques ou a des debris de pierres.\nRemontons a des temps plus anciens. II n'est pas\ndouteux qu'il y a eu en Asie Mineure une ville de Troie,\nautour de laquelle se sont Uvres de furieux combats,\nchantes par le plus grand des poetes. Mais les ruines en\nont presque entierement disparu, il n'en demeure plus que\nde vagues vestiges. Etiam periere ruinae. De Troie il ne\nreste plus guere que I'lhade. Or on peut pretendre, a\nI'extreme rigueur, que toute la poesie d'Homere n'est\nqu'une fiction.\nToutefois ce serait faire preuve d'un scepticisme peu\npardonnable que de nier la reahte de I'ancieime Troie.\nComment exphquer non seulement Homere, mais Eschyle,\nEuripide, Sophocle, Herodote, et toute la Htterature\ngrecque ? La reahte de I'ancienne Troie est une certitude,\nmais une certitude d'ordre inferieur a la certitude de\nCarthage, a plus forte raison a la certitude de Calcutta ou\nde Paris.\nDone, il eat dans les certitudes une sorte de hierarchic.\nPourquoi ? Faisons cette analyse.\nDes que je puis, a chaque minute de mon existence,\ncontroler, verifier un fait, U n'y a plus d'hesitation pos-\nsible. Nul doute n'est permis. Qu'un individu lunatique\nvienne me dire :\n\" Calcutta n'existe pas,\" je pourrai lui\nrire au nez, car je n'aurai qu'a entrer dans un bureau\ntelegraphique : au bout d'vme heure j'aurai la reponse de\nCalcutta. S'U me dit :\n\" Carthage n'a jamais existe,\" je\npourrai le renvoyer a Polybe, a Plaute, a Tite-Live, a\nPlutarque et a quarante auteurs latins, qui en parlent\ncomme d'une reahte incontestable. Je pourrai meme\nI'engager a aUer sur la rive africaine jusqu'a Tunis, et il\nverra pres de Tunis des ruines qui temoignent qu'il y eut\nla une grande vUle. Mais s'il me dit : \"la vUle de Troie\nn'a jamais existe,\" la demonstration du contraire sera plus\n\f426 Professor Charles Bichet. [part\ndifficile, et une discussion sera presque possible, malgre les\ndecouvertes de Schliemann ; car I'lliade d'Homere est un\npoeme et non un document historique. Qui sait si les\nGrecs, poetes et historiens, n'ont pas pris cette fiction pour\nune realit6 !\nPourtant je suis bien certain que Troie a existe. C'est\nune certitude historique, traditionnelle. Mais, comme elle\nne comporte pas une verification immediate qui entraine la\ncertitude absolue, c'est une certitude de second ordre.\nDe \\k cette proposition peu contestable que la certitude est\nd'autant plus grande que la verification pent se faire, facile\net prompte.\nCependant, en I'absence de tout controle immediat, il y\na dans le domaine des sciences historiques maintes certi-\ntudes qui sont absolues. Mais, pour qu'elles aient ce\ncaractere, il faut la multiplicite et I'authenticite des\ntemoignages. Quand on possede 20, 30 documents authen-\ntiques, on arrive a pouvoir affirmer les choses. Aussi toutes\nles questions de certitude historique traditionnelle sont-elles\ndifficiles a etablir. II faut beaucoup de sagacity et im esprit\nde critique penetrant pour distinguer ce qui est tres prob-\nable et ce qui est absolument certain.\nCharles I*^\"^ est mort sur I'echafaud. Brutus a tue Cesar.\nCain a tue Abel. Voila trois faits certains. Mais quelle\ndifference dans la certitude ! Pour le crime de Charles I'^'',\nnous avons tons les ecrits du temps, les lettres, les\nmemoires des contemporains, les archives du proces. Alors\ncertitude absolue. Pour la mort de Cesar, nous avons les\nlivres de Ciceron, de Su^tone, de Tacite, de Plutarque et\nde tous les auteurs latins, mais enfin ils ont pu se tromper\nen repetant la meme erreur. Pour le meurtre d'Abel,\nnous n'avons que le temoignage de la Bible. L'histoire\ndevient presque de la legende.\nAinsi la certitude va en se degradant a mesure que les\ntemoignages sont plus clairsemes. La certitude est d'autant\nphis grande que les temoignages sont plus abondants.\nII va de soi que la qualite de ces temoignages a un role\nessentiel ; un seul temoignage authentique pesera plus dans\nla balance quel vingt affirmations hasardeuses. Mais qui\nfera cette pesee ? II s'agit de nuances, d'appreciations\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions de la Certitude. 427\npersonnelles. La certitude historique n'a jamais le carac-\ntere absolu et dominateur d'une certitude scientifique laquelle\npeut toujours se verifier immediatement.\nPour prendre un exemple, je citerai un livre tres curieux\net tres savant de M. Conchond. Get auteur conclut que\nJesus-Christ n'a pas existe, que tout est mythe et legende.\nBien entendu je lui laisse la responsabilite de cette auda-\ncieuse assertion. Je I'indique seulement pour montrer a\nquel point la certitude historique est toujours fragile.\nLa certitude se transforme en efiet quand des assertions\ncontradictoires sont opposees, quelle que soit la valeur des\npreuves affirmatives. Les magistrats, cj^uand ils ont a\njuger, sont souvent tres embarrasses, car il se produit des\ntemoignages contradictoires et confus au milieu desquels il\nest permis d'hesiter.\nAnatole France conte quelque part I'histoire d'un jeune\nmagistrat qui, par la logique de son argumentation et par\nraccumulation de preuves formelles, avait fait condamner\nun individu a mort. Ce miserable 6tait certainement un\nassassin, mais cependant il s'obstinait a se dire innocent.\nOr le magistrat en toute conscience n'avait pas la moindre\nincertitude, et il etait bien convaincu que I'homme\nqu'U avait fait condamner avait reellement assassine.\n\u2022\nCependant, la veille de I'execution, ce jeune magistrat, qui\netait au debut de sa carriere et un peu inquiet de sa\nresponsabilite, alia trouver le condamne dans sa cellule et\nlui dit :\n\" Rien ne peut vous sauver : avouez que vous avez\ntue.\" \" Eh bien ! oui,\" dit le malheureux, \" oui, j'ai tue.\" Et\nce fut un grand soulagement pour le magistrat. II avait\ndeja la certitude, mais I'aveu dix coupable augmentait la\ncertitude, car la certitvide a des degres.\nSi j'insiste sur ces conditions de la certitude historique\nou judiciaire, c'est que souvent nous ne pouvons juger des\nfaits metapsychiques que d'apres des temoignages. Pour\ntoute une serie de phenomenes qui ne relevent pas de I'ex-\nperimentation, mais de I'observation, et d'une observation\nprise par des temoins, souvent peu competents, ou effrayes,\nou inattentifs, ou de memoire infidele, alors il faut une\ndocumentation severe qui ne peut jamais etre trop minu-\ntieuse. L'admirable recueil Phantasms of the Living, qu'aucun\n\f428 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nlivre n'a pu meme de loin egaler, nous donne des exemples\nde cette critique judicieuse. Les faits d'obeervation en-\ntrainent la certitude tout autant que les faits historiques,\nniais c'est une certitude inferieure a la certitude scientifique\nexperimentale, car les evenements, qui sont passagers et\nfugaces, ne peuvent se repeter, et nous sommes contraints\nde nous en rapporter aux temoignages des temoins dignes\nde foi.\nVoila pourquoi, lorsqu'un de nos correspondants nous\nsignale un fait d'hallucination veridique, nous y croyons\nassurement, mais nous en sommes beaucoup moins con-\nvaincus que lui, car il sait mieux que nous a quoi s'en\ntenir sur la veracite et la sagacite du temoin.\nII se produit meme fort souvent un fait bien singuHer et\nassez comique. Nous racontons un phenomene remar-\nquable, excellemment demonstratif, mais notre interlocuteur\nen est a peine emu. II hoche la tete, un peu sceptique,\net il ajoute :\n\" je ne crois pas beaucoup a votre r6cit.\nPourtant je connais un fait du meme genre, mais bien plus\nremarquable, que je vais vous citer.\" Helas ! le plus souvent\nce fait si remarquable est entache de maintes defectuosites.\nLa certitude des faits metapsychiques est un peu celle\ndes aerobthes. Un meteore lumineux a ete vaguement\nentrevu, diverses personnes ont cru entendre un grand\nfracas, et au bout de quelques heures on decouvre une\npierre bizarre qui n'etait pas la la veille. Mais vraiment\nn'etait-elle pas la ? Est-ce possible qu'elle soit descendue\ndu ciel ? Lavoisier, notre grand Lavoisier, le plus grand\ndes savants de tous les pays et de tous les temps, a ose\ndire :\n\" il n'y a pas de pierres tombant du ciel, parce qu'il\nn'y a pas de pierres dans le ciel.\"\nII faut done excuser les personnes (de moindre envergure\nintellectuelle que Lavoisier sans doute) qui, lorsqu'on leur\nfait des recits de fantomes appuyes de constatations mul-\ntiples et concordantes, n'ont qu'un sourire dedaigneux.\nTout depend pour une grande part du nombre et de la\nqualite des temoignages. Mais que le temoignage humain\nest faillible ! C'est effrayant !\nMon regrette ami Tli. Flournoy, de Geneve, raconte\nqu'un jour, a un de see cours, brusquement un individu,\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions cle la Certitude. 429\nqui sembLait prive de raison, est entre dans la salle, sur\nles hauts gradins, a prononce des paroles incoherentes avec\ngestes desordonnes et compliques, et est sorti precipitam-\nment. A peine etait-il sorti que Flournoy a dit a ses\neleves :\n\" jevines gens, faites attention, relatez-moi par ecrit\nexactement tout ce qui s'est produit : I'algarade et sa\nduree, I'heure de I'entree et de la sortie, les gestes, les\nparoles, la description de cet individu, car ce fut une\ncomedie par avance arrangee dans toutes ses minuscules\nphases. Je veux savoir jusqu'a quel point vous etes de\nbons obaervateurs.\" Eh bien ! ces jeunes gens, distingues\nphilosophes, ont donne sur ces deux minutes de tumulte\ndes relations tres differentes, incompletes et inexactes.\nNous avons pubhe jadis, avec mon ami Dariex, le cas du\nheutenant Escourrou, qui eut Toeil gauche blesse par une\nballe mortelle a I'assaut de La Puebla. Or sa mere, le\nmatin de ce meme jour, avait vu, sur un tableau repre-\nsentant le portrait de son fils, le meme oeil gauche saignant,\ndechire et elle en avait parle. Nous avons fait sur cette\nremarquable hallucination veridique une enquete appro-\nfondie. Dariex a ete chez M. et Me. Escourrou a deux\nreprises dilierentes. M. Escourrou pere etait un officier\nsuperieur, de bonne foi absolue. Voila done un fait bien\nautlientique dont la documentation est irreprochable. Or\nvoici qui est bien smgulier. Mon eminent ami Camille\nFlammarion raconte une histoire tout a fait analogue avec\nd'autres noms. Un officier fran^ais, M. de Boisleve, est\nblesse a I'oeil gauche lors de I'assaut de La Puebla. Madame\nde Boisleve, sa mere, I'aurait vu dans son salon le jour de\nsa blessure avec I'oeil gauche creve. Meme il parait qu'un\nproces-verbal de cette constatation a ete dresse. Mais oil\nest-il, ce proces-verbal 1 Nous n'en avons micune trace, et\nj'incline a penser qu'il s'agit la d'une histoire racontee\napres le deces du heutenant Escourrou et inexactement\nattribuee a d'autres personnes.\nJe ne veux pas refarre le hvre qu'ecrivait, il y a trois\nsiecles, Cornehus Agrippa sur I'incertitude des sciences.\nAgrippa croyait que la theologie etait superieure a toutes les\nsciences, ce que je n'ai garde d'admettre. Mais je croirais\nvolontiers a I'inexactitude (relative) du temoignage humain.\n2e\n\f430 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nHeureiisement, quand il s'agit des hallucinations veri-\ndiqnes, il y a des recits tellement nombreux, tellement\nincontestables, que, sous peine d'un scepticisme ridicule, il\nfaut accepter beaucoup de ces recits comme authentiques.\nEt la multiplicite des preuves pese d'un grand poids dans\nla balance. S'il n'y avait qix'un seul fait, absolument\nexact cependant, entoure de tous les temoignages et de\ntoutes les authenticites desirables, possedant toutes les\ngaranties de bonne observation et de veracite que vows\npourriez imaginer, ce fait, s'il etait unique, ne pourrait\nsuffire a nous convaincre qu'il n'y a pas eu erreur.\nDe la cette proposition qui n'est pas plus contestable\nque les deux autres et qui est tellement simple qu'elle est\npresque une naivete : la certitude croit non seulement avec le\nnomhre, mats avec la qualite des temoignages.\nII\nJe prendrai pour exemple des faits de science. Tout\nd'abord, quand on parle d'un fait scientifique, il semble\nqu'il n'y ait plus de place a I'incertitude. Et cependant . . .\nII est certain qu'il y a du fer dans I'eau de mer. Ce\nfer est en mininie quantite, mais enfin il y en a ; les\npoissons ont du fer dans le sang, les cendres de certains\nmollusques {Suberites dormmcula) sont extremement riches\nen fer, et cependant les reactifs chimiques ne permettent\nde deceler le fer dans I'eau de mer que lorsqu'on a evapore\nd'enormes quantites de liquide. Qui sait si pendant cette\nlaborieuse evaporation des parcelles de fer n'ont pas pu\netre introduites ? Nous sommes parfaitement certains qu'il\ny a du fer clans I'eau de mer, mais nous sommes beaucoup\nplus certains qu'il y a du chlore, car pour le chlore la\nverification pent se faire tout de suite. II suffira d'une\ngoutte d'eau de mer. Un etudiant chimiste qui commence\nsa premiere annee pourra en faire immediatement la preuve,\nsans manutention prealable, sans longues evaporations, alors\nque la constatation du fer est longue, dehcate et exige\ndes connaissances chimiques approfondies.\nLes astronomes ont mesure la distance qui separe la\nTerre de la Lune. A quelques kilometres pres, ils sont\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions de la Cerfihide. 431\nd'accorcl. Mais ils ont essaye aussi de mesurer la distance\nqui nous separe de Sirius par exemple, en prenant comme\nbase du triangle, non plus deux points de la terre, mais\nla terre aux deux points extremes de sa course annuelle.\nL'angle parallactique est, meme alors, extremement petit.\nMais. quelqiTe confiance que j'aie en ces mesures et ces\ncalculs, lorsqu'on me dit cj^ue I'etoile polaire est a mille\nannees de lumiere et que d'autres etoiles (c^u'on peut\nphotographier) sont a 300,000 annees de lumiere, j'en suis\nbeaucoup moins certain, quoique ma confiance en ces donnees\nde la science soit absolue.\nEn astronomic, comme en chimie, les faits certains sont\nd'une certitude diSerente.\nParlerai-je de la zoologie 1 Je suis certain cj^u'il y a\ndes elephants, car j'en ai vu, et je peux en voir quand je\nvoudrai. Je suis certain d'autre part qu'il y a eu des\nmammouths. II n'est pas permis d'en douter. Tout de\nmeme, malgre les preuves zoologiques. malgre les exem-\nplaires trouves en Siberie. presque intacts encore, la certi-\ntude est moindre pour I'ancienne existence des mammouths\nque pour I'actuelle existence des elephants.\nEn physiologie. je pourrais a ce propos mentionner\nquantite de faits certains, mais d'hierarchie differente dans la\ncertitude. Je me contenterai d'un seul exemple (qui m'est\nd'ailleurs guere plus demonstratif que beaucoup d'autres).\nEloiu:ens a montre que I'ablation du cervelet entraine\ndes troubles de I'equihbre. L'experience a ete faite des\nmilliers de fois sur des pigeons (surtout) et aussi eur des\nmammiferes : en outre, les medecins savent que toute\nlesion du cervelet entraine le vertige et I'incoordination\nmusculaire. Ce sont faits d'absolue certitude. Mais le\nphysiologiste itahen Luigi Luciani a prouve, en outre, qu'il\ny avait, en meme temps que des troubles de I'equilibre,\ndeficience musculaire. Les experiences sont bien demon-\nstratives : elles entrainent la certitude. Mais elles sont\ndifficiles a faire, 1' observation est dehcate, il faut une\ngrande habilete operatoire et une observation attentive\npour constater la deficience muscidaire apres I'ablation du\ncervelet. La deficience est certaine, mais moins certaine que\nI'incoordination.\n\f432 Professor Charles Richet. [PAET\nAinsi nous voyons que, dans les sciences comma dans\nnotre opinion sur les choses, la certitude, tout en restant\ncertitude, est differente selon que les faits peuvent etre\nrepetes avec plus ou moins de frequence ou de facilite, a\nI'aide d'appareUs plus ou moins compliques, avec un con-\ntrole plus ou moins rigoureux.\nLa Certitude est surtout un Fait d'habitude.\nJe vous ai expose des verites tres elementaires, tres\nnaives, presque des truismes, et je serais tente de m'en\nexcuser. Pourtant ce qui justifie mon insistance, c'est que\ncette variabilite de la certitude est souvent meconnue. Et\nj 'arrive alors graduellement a ce qui est le principal objet\nde ce bref discours, et j'espere que ma proposition ne vous\nparaitra pas trop paradoxale.\nJe vous la formulerai ainsi pour que vous puissiez bien\nla retenir ! on n'a de certitude absolue que 'pour les faits\nliabituels.\nPlus un fait est inhabituel, rare, exceptionnel, en appa-\nrente contradiction avec ce que nous voyons autour de\nnous a chaque instant, plus la certitude est difficile a\nacquerir. En depit de toutes les demonstrations, experi-\nmentales ou autres, on n'est jamais completement certain\nque des faits habituels. Et cela semble assez etrange.\nPourtant, lielas ! notre intelligence est assez mal faite pour\nqu'il en soit ainsi. C'est assurement un defaut de notre\nintelligence, mais nous n'y pouvons rien.\nVoici un petit fait qui etablit a quel point des raisonne-\nments, meme de la plus severe mathematique, sont parfois\nimpuissants a entrainer la conviction. On demontre en\ngeometric elementaire que, quelle que soit I'inclinaison de\nla section sur I'axe, la section d'un tronc de cone donne\ntoujours une ellipse reguliere. M. Thiers, le grand homme\nd'fitat, ayant voulu, sur ses vieux jours, s'initier aux\nmathematiques, se rebiffa devant cette demonstration\nrigoureuse. \" Non, non,\" disait-il, \" il est impossible qu'en\ncoupant obliquement un pain de sucre on n'ait pas une\nellipse oil il y a un gros bout d'un cote, et un petit bout\nde I'autre.\" II fallut alors, pour le convaincre, la preuve\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions de la Certitude. 433\nexperimentale. On fit scier obliquement un pain de sucre,\net on vit alors, a la grande surprise du President de la\nRepublique, que I'ellipse etait bien reguliere.\nDe meme que pour les demonstrations geometriques, la\ncertitude n'existe complete, radicale, absolue, que pour les\nfaits facilement accessibles a nos sens c'est-a-dire a des\nobservations quotidiennes, repetees, et repetables.\nOn raconte qu'un des academiciens du XVIII^\u2122\" siecle,\nI'abbe d'O etait fort avare. Un jour, a I'Academie,\non fit une collecte, chacun devant apporter sa petite somme.\nMais quand on fit le compte des oiTrandes remises, il en\nmanquait une. \"J'ai donne,\" dit I'abbe d'O . Un de\nses confreres obligeamment dit :\n\" je ne I'ai pas vu, mais\nje vous crois.\" Fontenelle ajoata :\n\" moi, je I'ai vu, mais je\nne le crois pas.\"\nQuand un fait est invraisemblable, on a beau I'avoir vu,\non ne se resigne pas tout de suite a y aj outer foi, la\nverite ne consent a etre acceptee que lorsqu'elle a pour\nelle la vraisemblance, c'est-a-dire I'habitude.\nC'est la le grand malheur de nos experiences et de nos\nobservations scientifiques. Vainement nous avons ete\ntemoins, et temoins rigoureux, vainement nous en avons\nrirrefragable certitude, eUes ne font pas partie integrante\nde nos convictions.\nPour le demontrer, je citerai deux exemples personnels,\nI'un de metapsychique subjective, 1' autre de metapsychique\nobjective, qui tous deux ont entraine ma conviction absohie,\net que cependant,\u2014ce qui est presque contradictoire avec\nma certitude,\u2014je voudrais repeter, et meme repeter plusieurs\nfois, afin de m'y habituer.\nA. Metapsychique Subjective.\u2014Pour le phenomene sub-\njectif, il s'agit d'une des plus belles experiences de Stephane\nOssovietzki. Avant que je ne partisse pour Varsovie, mon\nillustre amie, la comtesse de Noailles, m'avait remis trois\nenveloppes, soigneusement cachetees, et dont j'ignorais abso-\nlument le contenu. Je les montrai a Stephane en lui\ndisant d'en choisir une. II en prit une au hasard. Nous\netions, Geley et moi, en pleine lumiere, a cote de lui,\nsurveillant I'un et 1' autre ses moindres gestes, notant toutee\nses paroles. Or c'est a peine s'il a regarde I'enveloppe.\n\f434 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nII la palpait, la mettait derriere son dos, la froissait \\\nlegerement en tous sens et parlait de choses tres difiEerentes. ^\nAu bout d'une demi-heure environ il nous dit :\n\" il y a '\nquelque cliose de la Nature. C'est I'inspiration d'un grand I\npoete fran9ais. On dirait Rostand. Je vols beaucoup de \\\nlumieres pendant la nuit. C'est un vers de Chantecler dit\npar le Coq, et au-dessous il y a la signature, Edmond ,\nRostand.\"\nEn realite I'enveloppe que nous decachetames contenait\nces mots ecrits par Mme. de Noailles :\n\" c'est la nuit qu'il est ;\nbeau de croire d la lumiere. \u2022\nEdmond Rostand.' Ce vers de\nChantecler est dit par le Coq.\" :\nVoila une experience irreprocliable. EUe me suf&t.\nNulle erreur n'est possible.\nEn effet : 1\u00b0. Supposer une collusion entre Stephane 0. \u2022\net Mme. de Noailles, c'est monstrueusement idiot. Madame\nde Noailles ne connaissait absolument pas Stephane.\n2\u00b0. L'opacite de I'enveloppe etait complete, elle n'a ete\ndecachetee qu'apres que Stephane nous eut tout dit, la\nnuit, la lumiere, Chantecler, Rostand. D'ailleurs, pendant\ntout le temps de I'experience, c'est-a-dke j)endant environ :|\nune demi-heure, nous avons, Geley et moi, surveille .\nscrupuleusement tous les gestes de Stephane, sans nous\nrelacher dans notre surveillance.\nPuisque je parle ici de cette experience faite en commun, |\navec mon excellent ami Geley, qu'il me soit permis de lui\nadresser du haut de cette tribune un souvenir emu. Je\nn'ai pas connu d'observateur plus sagace, d'experimentateur\nplus penetrant, attentif aux moindres details, en meme\ntemps qu'apte aux plus puissantes generalisations. Helas !\nun cruel evenement I'a enleve a notre amitie et a notre\nadmiration ; ce fut une grande perte pour la science.\n3\u00b0. Supposer le hasard, c'est egalement absurde, comme\nle bons sens lindique. Si nous apphquons le calcul des\nprobabihtes, la citation d'un auteur, au heu d'une phrase\nquelconque, n'est que de 1\/50 environ ;\nque ce soit un\nvers plutot que de la prose, c\"est 1\/100, que ce vers soit\nde Rostand, c'est de 1\/10,000, que ce vers soit de Chan-\ntecler, c'est de 1\/100,000, que ce soit un vers oil il est\nquestion de nuit et de lumiere, c'est de 1\/10,000,000.\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions de la Certitude. 435\nAinsi le hasard ne peut etre mis en cause. Peu importe\nle nombre de zeros. A partir d'une probabilite tres faible,\nla certitude morale est a peu pres la meme.\nDone cette experience est demonstrative. NuUe fraude,\nnulle illusion, nulle collusion, nul hasard ne suffisant a\nI'expliquer. II faut admettre cette verite invraisemblable,\nsurprenante, que I'intelligence a des moyens de connais-\nsance autres que nos sens ordinaires.\nI^Ce fait, quoique inliabituel, et etrangement inhabituel,\nn'est pas unique. On en a rapporte de tres nombreux\nexemples bien authentiques dans tous les temps et dans\ntons les pays. Moi-meme je I'avais deja constate sur\ndivers sujets et j'ai public la-dessus il y a longtemps dans\nles Proceedings de votre Societe un volumineux memoire.\nA vrai dire, je ne crois pas qu'il y ait jamais eu de plus\nbelles experiences que celles d'Ossovietzki. Recemment, a\nCopenliague, il en a fourni encore un exemple remarquable,\nlequel, venant apres les trente experiences environ que nous\navons faites, Geley et moi, entrainait la certitude.\nL'experience du vers de Rostand n'est ni plus, ni moins\nirreprochable que mes precedentes experiences avec Stepliane.\nCe n'etait done que le controle des experiences anterieures.\nOr ce rigoureux controle a apporte un resultat d'une\nnettete eclatante. Ainsi done je tenais la certitude, certi-\ntude experimentale, absolue. II semblait que tout fut\nfini, puisque vraiment je ne pouvais rien supposer de plus\nconvaincant et de plus decisif que cette longue serie\nd'experiences sur la lucidite.\nHe bien ! c'est ici que va intervenir ce curieux sentiment\npsychologique, a moi persoimel, mais que je m'imagine\nbeaucoup de personnes ressentent comme moi, et sur lequel\nj'insiste. Quand il s'agit d'un phenomene iiahabituel, in-\nconnu, qui est en contradiction apparente avec tout ce\nque nous avons vu depuis notre eniance, avec tout ce que\nles liommes, vulgaires ou savants, nous ont dit depuis un\ntemps immemorial, alors une experience, si parfaite qu'elle\nsoit, ne suffit pas a entrainer une de ces certitudes ab-\nsolues qui defient le temps et les critiques. Une experience,\nce n'est pas vraiment assez : il en faut dix, il en faut vingt,\nil eu faut cent, il en faut toujours, pour que nous ayions\n\f436 Professor Charles Richet. [part\npris le parti d'accepter dans son integrite un phenomene\nanormal. Tant que le phenomene n'aura point passe dans\nnos habitudes, nous n'y poitrrons croire profondement,\nc'est-a-dire jusqu'aux racines memes de notre croyance.\nCar ce qui determine I'absolue et irremediable certitude\nd'un phenomene, c'est la frequence et la Constance de ce\nphenomene meme.\nJe lance en Fair une pierre, je suis certain qu'elle va\nretomber. Nul doute ne m'assiege. C'est la certitude\ndans toute sa puissance. D'autre part, Ossovietzki lit\ndans une enveloppe opaque une lettre cachetee. II n'a\npas pu la decacheter. II n'a pu savoir ce qu'elle contenait.\nLa lecture de cette lettre, sans le concours de la vue,\nest un fait aussi certain que la chute d'une pierre. Et\npourtant, sans avoir de doutes, je resiste dans mon for\ninterieur a admettre qu' il y a quelque connaissance des\nclioses exterieures sans le concours des sens, car ce serait\nla une faculte prodigieuse differant de tout ce qui est\nconnu, de tout ce qui a dirige les hommes, depuis des\nsiecles, de tout ce que j'ai vu depuis mon enfance, a\nchaque seconde de ma vie.\nII y a plusieurs annees, j'ai decouvert en physiologic un\nphenomene fondamental et paradoxal, que j'ai appele\nVanaphylaxie. L'anaphylaxie a ete repetee et verifiee dea\ncentaines et des milliers de fois, tant par moi que par un\nnombre immense cl'auteurs differents. La certitude en est\ndone absolue. Tout de meme, chaque fois que je le con-\nstate de nouveau, c'est toujours avec plaisir, et presque\navec surprise, car c'est un fait bien singuher, et je me dis\nalors avec une vraie satisfaction :\n\" decidement je ne m'etais\npas trompe.\"\nA plus forte raison quand il s'agit d'une experience de\ncryptestliesie (ou de lucidite), phenomene beaucoup plus\nmysterieux, et plus stup^fiant, et plus etrange, que l'anaphy-\nlaxie. On veut toujours recommencer. Apres la lettre de\nMme. de Noailles, j'en ai donne a Ossovietzki une autre de\nSarah Bernhardt, et une autre, et une autre encore, et\ntoujours dans des conditions de rigueur irreprochable, et\ntoujours avec le meme succes.\nII semble que je ii'avais pas besoin de fortifier ma\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions de la Certitnde. 437\ncertitude, et cependant je demandais toujours a recom-\nmencer.\nA mesure que le temps passe, notre certitude des faits\ninhabituels, faits que nous avons cependant dument con-\nstates, va en s'affaiblissant. Les raisonnements les plus\nsolides, les experiences les plus decisives, n'ont pas la force\nde compenser I'inhabitude des faits.\nSurtout ne pretendez pas que, si vous doutez vaguement\nde tel ou tel phenomene inhabituel, c'est que vous ne\nI'avez pas compris. Quelle erreur ! Nous n'avons a vrai\ndire rien compris a I'univers mysterieux qui nous entoure,\nnous sommes environnes d'un Kosmos oil tout est a la fois\nhabituel et incomprehensible. Mais I'habitude en masque I'in-\ncomprehension. Oil est le fil qui attire a la terra la pomme\nde Newton, quand elle se detache de I'arbre ? Nous disons :\n\" c'est I'attraction.\" Mais quoi !

Je suis absolument certain que Stephane n'a\npas pu connaitre, par le secours des sens normaux (com-\nmuns a tous les hommes) les mots et les idees que contenait\ncette lettre.

Metajjsychique objective. \u2014Si da la metapsychiqua sub-\njective nous passons a la metapsychiqua objective, las\ndifficultes deviennent plus grandes encore. Je pourrais citer\nbeaucoup d'axperiences. Ja me contenterai d'en signaler\nune seula, parca qu'alle a ce double caractere d'avoir ate\nreahsee dans des conditions irreprochables et, d'autra part,\nd'avok ete unique, en ce sens que je n'ai pas pu la\nretrouvar una seconde fois.\nA I'lla Ribaud, un soir, apres une seance plus ou moins\ninteressante, en presence d'Ochorowitz, de Fred. Myers, et\nde sir OHver Lodge, Eusapia a presante le phenomena\nsuivant. Et je crois bien qua parsonne na pourra contestar\nla competence de cas obsarvateurs.\nJe prends dans ma main droite la main d' Eusapia et ja tiens\nabaisse mon index de maniere qu'il depassa notablamant la\ntouta petite main d' Eusapia. Alors elle dirige ma main at\nma fait promener mon index sur du papier blanc. A masura\nqua mon index se promene sur le papier, una marque\napparait sur ce papier, an bleu, comme un trait bleu. Avec\nsa main gauche levee tres haut en I'air Eusapia tenait un\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions de la Certitude. 439\ncrayon bleu qu'elle serrait convulsivement. Le phenomene\nse passait a la Ivimiere d'une bougie qui etait presque au\ncontact du papier, tant elle etait proche.\nTons les souvenir's de ce fait remarquable sont minutieuse-\nment graves dans ma memoire, et je m'en souviens\ncomme si c'etait hier. Je vois encore Myers, avec son\nlorgnon, penche sur le papier, et regardant attentiveinent,\nscrupuleusement, le phenomene. Quatre a cinq fois sur des\nfeuilles de papier blanc (des enveloppes blanches neuves),\nla meme trace bleue a apparu. Je suis absolument siar\nque la main d'Eusapia ne touchait pas le papier qui\nn'etait en toute certitude touche que par men mdex, lequel\nn'avait pas la plus petite trace de bleu. Pendant pres de\ndix minutes, toujours a la lumiere d'une bougie, I'experience\ns'est repetee, soit sur du papier, soit sur le plastron blanc\nde nos chemises.\nJe n'ai pas le plus leger doute sur la realite du pheno-\nmene ainsi constate.\nNulle hallucination possible. Nous etions tous les quatre\nen notre etat parfaitement normal, et tres sceptiques, tres\nincredules. Le controle de quatre investigateurs attentifs\net avertis est un controle a la quatrieme puissance. La\nlumiere de la bougie nous permettait de tres bien voir tout.\nSur du papier parfaitement blanc, tous les quatre, nous\nvoyions sous mon doigt, et sous man doigt seul, au fur et\na mesure que je le promenais sur le papier, apparaitre une\nhgne bleue.\n1\nOr, c\"est la un phenomene si etrange, si inhabituel, qui\nfait une telle rupture avec nos habitudes quotidiennes, avec\ntoutes les donnees scientifiques ou vulgaires, que malgre\nma certitude sur son authenticite, je suis amene a dire que\nc'est une certitude de second ordre, parce que les phenomenes\nne peuvent pas etre repetes et parce qu'ils font violence a\ntoutes les donnees usuelles.\nJe pourrais citer encore bon nombre de phenomenes\nobjectifs qui me paraissent avoir la meme force probatoire,\nmais je ne peux pas faire ici un cours de metapsychique ;\n^ Arnaud de Gramont m'assura avoir vu le meme phenomene avec\nEusapia. A. de Rochas en parle sommairement {Vexteriorisation de la\nmotricite, page 140).\n\f440 Professor Charles Richet. [part\net je me contenterai de dire encore que nous aurions\nmaiivaise grace a reprocher aux sceptiques leur scepticisme.\nlis n'ont rien vu et ils doutent. C'est bien explicable,\npiusque nous avons vu et que nous avons tant de peine\na accepter ce que nous avons vu. Cela justifie ma formule\nprecedente, a savoir qu'on ne manie pas la conviction par\ndes demonstrations experimentales, logiques ou mathe-\nmatiques. La conviction resulte de I'habitude et non de\nla demonstration. Faire assister a ces experiences d'ecto-\nplasmie des personnes qui n'ont encore rien vu de tel,\nc'est, selon toute probabilite, ne pas les convaincre. II m'a\nfallu pres de vingt cinq ans d'etudes perseverantes, parfois\ndans des conditions extremement favorables, pour me\nrendre. J'ai fait une defense desesperee avant d'etre\nconvaincu de la r6alite de la metapsychique objective.\nComment demander aux autres hommes cette longue et\nprolongee patience ?\nVoila poxxrquoi je n'ai aucune sympathie pour les com-\nmissions d'enquete, les controles auxquels sont convoques\ndes hommes loyaux et intelligents, certes, mais inhabiles a\nces etudes, et surtout non habitues aux ph6nomenes\nbizarres (et, dans le sens vulgaire du mot, enormement\nabsurdes) de la metapsychique.\nD'ailleurs, presque jamais la science ne progresse que par\nle travail d'xm individu isole. Elle n'est pas un fruit\ncoUectif, plus que ne peuvent I'etre un drame ou une\nstatue.\nCette necessite de repeter les experiences, meme quand\non en a obtenu de tout a fait certaines, exphque pourquoi,\nquand il s'agit du phenomene tant conteste, mais a mon\navis nuUement contestable, de I'ectoplasmie, nous recom-\nmenQons I'exp^rience sans nous lasser, alors cependant, que,\nselon toute vraisemblance, rien de nouveau ne va se\nproduire. Les experiences innombrabies que je fis avec\nEusapia et avec Gouzik sont d'une monotonie effarante.\nDes contacts, des impressions de mains ou de moignons,\nde ridicules mouvements d'objets, tous phenomenes qui se\nrepetent sans se perfectionner, et qui ne paraissent guere\ncapables d'un progres quelconque.\nEt cependant, chaque fois qu'on a assiste a une tele-\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions de la Certitude. 441\nkinesie indiscutable, quand il y a eu une ectoplasmie dont\nla realite n'est pas douteuse, on est tres satisfait. On se\nconfirme dans son opinion, et la certitude deviant de plus\nen plus imperieuse.\nMais\u2014chose singuHere\u2014cette certitude s'envole avec le\ntemps. En sortant d'une belle et decisive seance, on n'a\npas I'ombre d'un doute. Mais, a niesure que le temps\npasse, le doute arrive. On est pris de scrupules retro\n-\nspectifs, car tout ce qu'on voit autour de soi est contraire\na cette etrange ectoplasmie, qu'on na' pu entrevoir que\npendant quelques secondes. Au bout d'mi an, on est\ndevenu tout a fait hesitant, et, pour peu qu'on reste\nquelques annees sans nouvelles experiences, on est envahi\npar un scepticisme plus dangereux encore que celui des\nindividus qui n'ont rien vu.\nJe le repete de nouveau, car c'est le point fondamental\nque je veux etablir : pour croire completement d un pheno-\nmene, il faut y etre habitue.\nAussi me parait-il tres important, apres qu'on a note\ntous les details d'une experience, de ne pas se contenter\nde cette notation, mais d'y ajouter quelque chose d'essen-\ntiel, la conviction qu'on avail immediatement apres Vex-\nperience. II faut ecrire resolument sur ses notes :\n\" je suis\nabsolument convaincu que nuUe fraude n'etait possible.\"\nC'est cela qui compte, et non les doutes retrospectifs qui\npeuvent, a tout moment, et parfois sans raison, s'emparer\nde notre esprit.\nConclusions.\nEt mauitenant, il faut conclure, car sans etre des\napotres, nous avons malgre nous, tous, plus ou moins\nI'ardent desir de faire passer notre conviction dans I'esprit\ndes hommes. Ce que nous croyons etre la verite, ce qui nous\nparait etre la certitude, malgre notre rebellion instinctive\npour tout fait inhabituel, si cela n'est accepte ni par le\npubhc, ni par les savants, alors nous en ressentons une\nvraie douleur intellectuelle. C'est meme un sentiment\nassez noble que cette tendance a faire partager notre\nopinion aux autres hommes. Car, en reaUte, le vrai\n\f442 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nsavant est celui-la, qui, sans aucun interet de vanite ou\nde lucre, veut repandre des faits qu'il regards, en toute\nconscience, comme certains.\nDone il faut d'abord commencer par acquerir notre\ncertitude personnelle. Elle ne pourra etre obtenue que\npar de repetees experiences. Ne craignons pas de les\nmultiplier, meme quand elles ne nous doivent donner que\ndu clejd vu, car chaque nouvelle experience justifie notre\ncroyance, et, sans doute, chaque fois qu'on la repete, on a\nelimine un doute, un scrupule, qui nous empechait de croire\nsans reserve.\nNotre conviction personnelle ne pent pas, pour les choses\nraetapsychiques, etre livresque, due a la lecture de tels ou\ntels ouvrages, aux recits qui nous sont apportes par des\ntemoins, meme dignes de foi, ou par des savants, meme\ntres habiles. Toutefois, pour appuyer notre certitude, il\nest bon de relire et de mediter ce qu'ont dit les maitres. lis\nont eu les memes doutes qiie nous, et ils ont obtenu la\ncertitude par les memes voies.\nAlors ce n'est pas seulement pour le public que I'appui\nd'autres temoignages autorises est important, essentiel : c'est\nencore pour nous. Vae soli. Malheur a celui qui est seul\na soutenir une opinion, car, malgre toute sa confiance en\nson jugement, il va se sentir affaibli dans sa certitude,\ns'il est tout seul a I'avoir.\nAinsi done, pour notre propre certitude, voir beaucoup\nd'experiences, les repeter sans se lasser, lire et relire ce\nqui a ete ecrit par d'excellents observateurs, je ne vols\npas d'autre moyen efficace pour combattre notre neophobie\nnaturelle, notre aversion pour les idees nouvelles qui ne\ncadrent pas avec 1\n'ensemble dogmatique de la science\ncontemporaine\n.\nUne fois que nous serons arrives a la certitude absolue,\nirrefragable, il s'agira de la faire partager au public. Mais\ncela, c'est tres difficile, et peut-etre meme assez sterile, car\nnos observations et nos experiences, malgre leur precision,\nn'entraineront pas la conviction de nos lecteurs ou de nos\nauditeurs. La encore il faudra la repetition. II faudra\nrendre les phenomenes metapsychiques habituels, car les\nhommes (et les savants peut-etre plus que les autres\n\fxcv.] Des Conditions de la Certitude. 443\nhommes) n'acceptent pas ce qui ne leur est pas repete a\nsatiete.\nEt, po^^^ justifier mon opinion, je prendrai un exemple\nrecent, celui de I'aviation.\nJtisque aux premieres annees de ce siecle, personne ne\ncroyait qu'il fut possible de voler avec des appareils plus\nlourds que Fair. On ridiculisait les constructeurs de ces\naeroplanes. lis passaient pour des fous, des illumines. En\n1894 j 'avals construit et essaye une machine volante (plus\nlourde que Fair, naturellement). Alors on m'a montre, dans\nune caricature repandue a profusion, tenant grotesquement\na la main une de ces stupides machines.\nQuand je dis que personne n'y croyait, J'exagere. II y\navait bien, de par le monde entier, une trentaine de\npersonnes persuadees que les oiseaux ne volent pas par\ndes moyens surnaturels, et que le probleme de I'aviation\npar des machines lourdes, etait un probleme soluble. Et\npourtant la neophobie generale etait telle que les quelque\ntrente individus croyant au plus lourd que Fair etaient\nconsideres comme des demi-alienes.\nMais, une fois que la demonstration a ete faite\u2014et je ne\nparle pas de la demonstration scientifique qui ne touche\npas le public, mais de la demonstration industrielle, qui\nseule a de I'effet\u2014alors aussitot un phenoniene psycho-\nlogique des plus singuliers s'est produit.\nCes machines volantes, auxquelles personne ne croyait,\ntout le monde y a cru, et non seulement on y a cru,\nmais encore, ce qui est profondement comique, on a\naffirme y avoir cru toujours. En 1910, on n'aurait pas\ntrouve une seule personne disant :\n\" je n'ai jamais cru au\nplus lovird cj^ue I'air.\" Tous les hommes ont pense, en toute\nbonne foi, je suppose, qu'ils n'avaient jamais mis en doute\nla possibilite de cette invention.\nEh bien, pour les phenomenes metapsychiques, au jour,\nprochain peut-etre, oii les experiences jjourront se rejecter\nfacilement, tout le monde sera avec nous, et on dira \" j'y\nai toujours crvi !\n\"\nAttendons done ce jour et ayons confiance.\nNe vous lassez pas, mes chers collegues, dans votre\nlabeur.\n\f444 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nEt surtout soyez convaincus que les verites de la meta-\npsychique sont plus importantes que toutes autres verites\nscientifiques.

Piper and the Imperator Band. 445\nMRS. PIPER AND THE IMPERATOR BAND OF\n\" CONTROLS.\"\nBy a. W. Trethewy.\n(1) This paper is based on the articles about Mrs. Piper's\nmediumship which have appeared in the 8.P.R. Proceedings,\nand on the typed records of Hodgson's sittings with her\nfrom 1896 to 1905 in the S.P.R. library. The Stainton\nMoses, Imperator, Rector, etc., of Mrs. Piper's trance are\ndesignated as S. M.p, Imperatorp, Rector p, etc. The refer-\nences to volumes and pages are to the S.P.R. Proceedhigs,\nand those to dates and pages with the word \" Records\n\"\nare to the books of typed records.\n(2) So much has been written about Mrs. Piper's medium-\nship by experts in psychical research, that it may seem\npresumptuous on the part of a tyro to add to the litera-\nture. My excuse is that I shall restrict myself to a\nsingle problem\u2014namely, the question of the identity of the\nIntelligences who communicated through her under the\nnames of Stainton Moses and his controls Imperator,\nRector, Doctor, Prudens and Mentor\u2014and this point\nis one on which I may claim to have some special know-\nledge, as far as the internal evidence goes, owing to my\nstudy of the work of Stainton Moses.\n(3) There seem to be two main difficulties in the dis-\ncussion. The first is the difference in the kind of com-\nmunication ordinarily received through the two mediums\nrespectively, which suggests a difference in their methods\nand therefore makes it unsafe to argue from one to the\nother on the basis of analogy. For instance, much of the\ninformation which came through Stainton Moses is traceable\nto a printed source, with which it is probably connected,\neven if it did not originate therein. The unconscious\nexercise of clairvoyance may reasonably be regarded in\n\f446 A. W. Trethewy. [PABT\nhis case as an alternative to the spiritualistic theory.\nWith Mrs. Piper, on the other hand, the alternative appears\nto be rather a form of telepathy. Another instance of\nthe difference between them is the occurrence of physical\nphenomena at seances with Stainton Moses, which, by their\nconnection with the automatic writing, tend to support the\nspiritualistic theory, whereas there were no physical pheno-\nmena with Mrs. Piper except the withering of flowers\nattributed to supernormal agency.\n(4) The second difficulty is inherent in the spiritualistic\ntheory, and consists in the uncertainty of estimating the\n|\ndegree in which the medium's mind may colour or distort\nthe message. The apphcation of this factor should not\nbe strained to cover every contradiction or inaccuracy,\nbut the only check on its use is a priori speculation, an\nunsatisfactory guide.\n(6) For the present purposes I assume that the \" Con-\ntrols \" or \" Guides \" of Stainton Moses were spirits with\nexistence independent of his, and not merely the creations\nof his subliminal mind. I make a similar assumption in\nMrs. Piper's case, to facilitate the comparison of the two\ngroups, except in so far as the consideration of a specific\nalternative theory may clear the ground in some par-\nticular situation. The question to be discussed is whether\nher \" Controls \" were identical with his, and not who or\nwhat they were if the answer is in the negative.\n(6) As the spirit of Stainton Moses professed to com-\nmunicate through Mrs. Piper and to introduce the spirits\nwho had controlled him on earth, it will be convenient to\ndeal with his case first. He did not come without an\ninvitation. Hodgson in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIIL\npage 408, gave a short account of the sitting at which\nthe subject was broached, and stated in a footnote that a\nmore detailed account would be given in Part II. of his\nreport. Part II. was never written by him, but the inci-\ndent seems to be the same as narrated by Professor\nR^omaine Newbold (W. R. N.) in Vol. XIV. ppl 36 et seq.\nOn June 19th, 1895, the sitter (W. R. N.) quoted the writ-\nings of Stainton MosesJin the course of an argument with\nGeorge Pelhamp, and at the next two sittings asked that\n\fxcv.] Mrs. Piper and the Imperafor Band. 447\nhis attendance should be procured if possible. On the\n22nd and 24th Stainton Moses p came and gave some in-\nformation about the opinions expressed in Spirit Teachings\nand about the identity of his \" Controls.\" He said that\nsome teachings given through him in his earth hfe about\nthe condition and practices of the spirit after the physical\ndeath of the body were wrong in certain respects. He\naccounted for these errors (Vol. XIV. page 40) as having\n'\nbeen due to his misunderstanding the communications from\nhis Guides in his earth life. This explanation is hardly\ncredible, for the subjects were essential parts of their\nteaching. The only other theory that seems to me at\nall plausible, while consistent with his identity, is that\nowing to conflict with the views of Mrs. Piper or the\nsitter his rephes to the questions did not come through\nproperly. If either of these persons did hold strong\nopinions about the subjects discussed, a point on which I\ncan find no information, this aspect is worthy of con-\nsideration, though the assumed distortion of the message\nexceeds the Hmits of probabihty.\n(7) The information given by S. M.p at these sittings\nabout the names of the \" Controls \" had not \" the least\nsemblance of truth \" (page 41 id.), but the names which\nhe gave are not quoted in the Proceedings, and lilank\nspaces have been left where the names should be in the\ntyped records of these seances. The original manuscript\nrecords are not in the S.P.R. office, but Mrs. Sidgwick\nhas recently obtained the information from Professor New-\nbold and has kindly passed it on to me. On June 22nd,\n1895, S. M.p said that Rector was Dr. Wallace., and that\nDoctor was his (S. M.'s) father. On June 24th he cor-\nrected himself, stating that Rector (not Doctor) was his\nfather, and that Doctor was not Wallace but Walton, a\n\" Dr. Walton \" whom he had known at college. Then on\nbeing questioned as to who Imperator was, he gave the\nname of David, and on being asked whether he meant\nKing David he assented, adding that he had written it\n(\"David\") in his script without divulging it to anybody.\nThe names which these Guides gave to Stainton Moses are\nmentioned in paragraph 26 below. Stainton Moses' father\n\f448 A. W. Trethewy. [part\nwas alive while his son was doing the greater part of his\nautomatic writing under the influence of these \" Controls \"\n;\nhe took no interest in, and apparently displayed no knowledge\nof, his son's mediumistic experiences.\nOn a later occasion, October 14th, 1896, S. M.p stated\nthrough G. P.p that Imperator had been St. Joseph, the\nfather of Christ (Vol. XXVIII. page 90). When G. P.p\nwas told that this statement was wrong, a soi-disant Dr.\nArthur Myers p intervened with the unsatisfactory allegation\nthat Stainton Moses' father and not Stainton Moses in\nperson had been responsible for it (pp. 91, 459 id.). S. M.p\ncertainly was correct in stating on November 9th, 1896,\n\" Records \" page a. 165, that Plato had been one of his\nGuides. The inclusion of so weU known a person may\nhave been due to guess work, and this presumption is\nstrengthened by the fact that he mentioned Demetrius also\non the same date, though no such name is to be found in\nStainton Moses' books of automatic script or seance records.\n(8) On February 17th, 1897, \"Records\" page 193, S. M.p\nsaid that for the automatic writing of his earth life he\nused to give each of his Guides a separate pencil. This\nstatement was untrue. A pen, and not a pencU, was used\nin the books of automatic script, and the same pen was\nkept in use in spite of a change of writer. On page 273\nof The Controls of Stainton Moses is an illustration of the\npen being adapted to a remarkable alteration in the hand-\nwriting. In reply to Mr. F. W. Percival's questions, he\nmade other mistakes about features of his mediumship.\nHe wrongly mentioned hyacinth and lily of the vaUey as\nscents frequently produced at seances, and an opal instead\nof a turquoise as the stone especially brought for Mr.\nPercival, to whom I am indebted for these corrections.\n(9) In matters not connected with his mediumship S. M.p\nwas often in error. On April 2nd, 1897, \" Records \" page\n15, Hodgson told him that Massey said that aU his answers\nto Massey's questions were wrong. In Vol. XXVIII. page\n97, Mrs. Sidgwick quotes what seems to have been a pure\ninvention. He referred to an evening spent at Professor\nSidgwick's house, though in fact he had never been inside\nthe house.\n\fxcv,] Mrs. Piper and the Imperator Band. 449\n(10) On a slightly different footing but equally unsatisfac-\ntory was his conduct in connection with his mother's death.\nShe survived him, and died at the end of 1896 or early\nin 1897, while he was frequently attending Hodgson's\nseances with Mrs. Piper. He said nothing about her death,\nand thus missed a capital opportunity of giving a good\ntest, as Hodgson told George Pelhamp on January 19th,\n1897, \"Records\" page 119. In reply to Mr. F. W.\nPercival, he said that he had gone to the funeral, but he\ncould not give the name of the officiating priest, and he\ndescribed wrongly the position of the grave, as I have\nascertained from Mr. Percival, whose help I acknowledge\nwith gratitude.\n(11) The most important point in his favour is that he\ndoes appear to have furnished on one occasion \" some\nprivate information unknown to the sitters, and afterwards\nverified in England, and well adapted so far as it went as\nan indication of identity \" (Vol. XIII. page 408). Hodgson,\nwho was responsible for this statement, gave no particulars,\nand Mrs. Sidgwick, who referred to it (Vol. XXVIII. page\n98), could not discuss its evidential value for want of the\ninformation. She gathers \" from the way Hodgson speaks\nof it that it does not go far to outweigh the many irre-\nlevant, unplausible, and false statements which have to be\nexplained away.\" This conclusion seems quite fair.\n(12) The communications of S. M.p make a favourable\nimpression on me only when he laments in a general way\nhis inability to remember the events of his earth Hfe, and\ndescribes in touching words the confusion of mind pro-\nduced by renewing contact with the plane from which he\nhas passed. His manner is then plausible, almost con-\nvincing indeed, and I feel that perhaps he may be the\nreal Stainton Moses struggling vainly with elusive memories\nand incapable of expressing himself. This impression is\nobUterated as soon as he commits himself to details.\nSympathy then gives place to distrust. On page 98 of\nVol. XXVIII. Mrs. Sidgwick's opinion is recorded\n\u2014\" We\nmust regard W. Stainton Moses as having failed to estabhsh\nhis identity.\" I would go even further and say that we\nare justified in regardmg his claim as false, for in my\n\f450 A. W. Trethewy. [part\nopinion if a person still in the flesh made such a claim and\ngave such evidence in a court of law he would not only\nlose his suit, but would probably be prosecuted for perjury.\n(13) Of course the failure of S. M.p reacts on the claims\nof his \" Controls,\" Imperatorp, Rectorp, etc., to be iden-\ntical with the \" Controls \" of Stainton Moses who used the\nsame pseudonyms. In fairness to them, however, their\ncases may be considered on their merits without being\nprejudiced by the collapse of their sponsor, S. M.p. Mrs.\nSidgwick, in rejecting their claims (see page 98 of Vol.\nXXVIII.), seems to have based her decision mainly on the\ncommunications made by S. M.p and by them in 1896 and\n1897, several of which have been reproduced in that volume.\nThe statements which they made about the names which\nthey had borne in earth life, and the accounts which they\ngave about the characters of the Bible, seem to me too\npreposterous to deserve serious discussion. At any rate, if\nthe latter cannot be proved to be false, though contrary\nto the contents of the Bible, they are certainly quite out\nof keeping with the teachings given to Stainton Moses by\nthe origmal Imperator.^ In this respect, however, there is\none excuse to be made for them, as put forward by G. P.p\non April 3rd, 1900, \" Records \" page 376, who said that\nthey ought to reaHse that they had not developed pro-\nperly when they talked this nonsense in the early days of\ntheir association with Mrs. Piper. There is really some-\nthing in this plea. Whatever view is taken of their\npersonahties, it is undeniable that the coherence, the thought\nand the diction of their communications at Hodgson's\nseances improved a great deal after the first haK of 1897.\nToo much stress should not be laid on the early absur-\ndities. Other aspects of the case should also be considered.\n(14) There certainly is in some respects a similarity be-\ntween their attitude towards Mrs. Piper and the attitude\nof Stainton Moses' \" Controls \" towards him, but perhaps\n^ One point not exjDressly noticed in Vol. XXVIII. may be mentioned.\nOn March 10th, 1897 (p. 480 id.), Imperatoi- expressed a Iiigh opinion\nof Abraham, but Stainton Moses' Imperator on more than one occasion\ndistinctly expressed a rather low estimate of the qualities of that\npersonage.\n\fxcv.] Mrs. Piper and the Imperator Band. 451\nno greater than we should expect to find between all good\n\" Controls.\" In both cases they were very careful of the\nmedium's condition ;\nthey insisted on the maintenance of a\ngood state of health for the exercise of psychic powers, and\nthey restricted admission to sitters in whom they felt\nconfidence. Hodgson, in Vol. XIII. pp. 408, 409, expresses\na very decided opmion of the success of then' management\n;\nsee also his letter to Dr. HaU, page 286 of Vol. IX. of\nthe Journal of the S.P.R. At a later stage in 1910, 1911,\nthey gave several warnings of the expediency of stoppuag\nsittings, declared their intention of withdrawing, and sub-\nsequently carried it out. This was on a par with the\nlater stages of Stainton Moses' mediumship.\n(15) To some extent the objects of the \" Controls \" of\nthe two mediums were identical. In the case of Stainton\nMoses they professed to have a mission for the enlighten-\nment of the world through him, and used his powers\ngrudgingly for other purposes. Mrs. Piper's controls, to\ndo them justice, may have had a similar object in view\nwhen they undertook to repair her organism. They cer-\ntainly preferred teaching to tests, but in order to provide\nfunds for the support of the medium they had to admit\non payment sitters who wished to converse with deceased\nrelations and friends. Keepmg in view their favourite\npurpose, they insisted on sittings being allotted to a particular\nsitter, ]\\Ir. Z., on whose mission they laid stress. They seemed\nto take great pleasure in giving him instruction and preparing\nhim for his duty. It seems unlikely, however, that Stainton\nMoses' band would have returned to earth again, or, having\nreturned, would have remained, to be in charge of a medium\nwho could be used so little for their mam purpose. It is\nto me quite incredible that they would ever have conde-\nscended to give advice about investments after the manner\nof Mrs. Piper's \"Controls\" (see Vol. XXVIII. page 111;\nand \" Records,\" June 27th, 1899, pp. 351 et seq. ; June\n29th, 1899, pp. 364 to 368).\n(16) The teaching given to this sitter is sufficiently\nimportant to deserve notice m detail. On February 1st,\n1899, \" Records \" pp. 75 et seq., he was encouraged to\nconsider that he had a mission m connection with the\n\f452 A. W. Treihewy. [PABT\nBand, that he would be in rapport with them and inspked\nby them. On AprU 17th, 1899, pp. 141, 142, he was told\n\u2014\" a new light is opening through thy hfe whereby divine\ntruth can be revealed to the world . . . but, friend, we\nsee thee often lapse back into a state of questioning . . .\nWe act with such as thee directly, with others remotely.\"\nOn January 22nd, 1900, \" Records \" page 82, and on\nFebruary 12th, 1900, \" Records \" page 153, it was said\nthat, inspired by the Band, he would write for the\nbenefit of mankind. He was not always responsive. For\ninstance, on June 17th, 1902, \" Records \" pp. 693, 695, he\nabruptly changed the svibject, interrupting the teaching by\nasking for advice about his own immediate needs. Appar-\nently the Band were not always satisfied with him, for on\nJuly 1st, 1902, \" Records \" page 725, they said :\n\" We\nlove thee but not thy moods, they are not of the highest.\"\n(17) The following extracts from the typed records will\nshow the tenor of these teachings :\nApril 10th, 1899, page 137 : \"Thou art a part of God, the\nSpirit of God is within thee, we will bring thee into a\nhigher condition than thou hast ever known.\" Page 138 :\n\" Cease to regret the past, pray to the spirit of calm and\npeace for power to control thy body.\" Page 139 :\n\" God\nhath promised us that we may remain untU we have satis-\nfied Him with our work.\" Page 139 :\n\" Thoughts cannot\ninjure others, but acts can.\" \u2022\nDecember 26th, 1899, page 600 :\n\" Findmg God is finding\na better side of one's self and livmg by it, listening to its\npromptmgs ; it is being guided by the higher thought,\nwhich does come from the mfinite and all-wise Spirit ; the\ntrue Ego, the higher, better self, is a part of God.\"\nFebruary 20th, 1900, page 177 :\n\" God is spirit, we do\nnot say a spirit, but sjnrit . . .

For almost all the sittings, owing to Hodgson's\nabsence, Mr. Z.'s notes are the only record. Sometimes\nthere is no record, either because the communications were\ntreated as private and confidential, or because they were\nmade by word of mouth instead of being written, and were\nspoken too quickly to be taken down. The notes seem\nrarely to be more than fragmentary. Perhaps if there\nwere a complete record the instructions would be more\nsatisfying than what is embodied m the notes, and there\nwould not be so many gaps and unfulfilled promises of\nimparting knowledge.\n(19) It is noticeable that two ideas of God run through\nthe discourses. One is that God is the all-pervading\nspirit of wliich man's spirit is a part. The other is the\nanthropomorphic conception of a supreme personahty who\nhas commissioned the Band as his agents. Illustrations of\nboth conceptions are to be found in the extracts quoted\nabove. The following passages, taken from communications\naddressed to Mr. Z. and other sitters, are quoted below to\nbring out the anthropomorphic conception more fuUy :\nApril SOth, 1900, page 408 : \"He [Imperator] is next to\nthe All-wise.\"\nMarch 4:th, 1901, page 175 :\n\" God hath most profoundly\nstated that under our guidance aU wiU end well.\"\nApril 18th, 1901, page 331 :\n\" Per order from the Most\nHigh through His Messenger f Imperator.\"\n\fxcv.] Mrs. Piper and the Imperator Band. 455\nJanuary 23rd, 1905, page 153 :\n\" We do know and God\nhath promised us greater knowledge of the conditions sui'-\nrounding him [S].\"\nApril mil, 1905, page 742 :\n\" We do not see Him [God],\nbut we feel Hun.\"\n(20) The inconsistency between the two conceptions of\nGod is hard to understand, but speculation about the\norigins of the two conflicting ideas is outside the scope of\nthe present article. It is sufficient to say that neither\nconception is suggestive of the attitude of Stainton Moses'\nGuides. The level of their teaching may not have been\nabove the best productions of Mrs. Piper's \" Controls,\" but\nit was on different lines\u2014the truth to be found in all\nreligions, the consequences entailed by actions, the fallacy\nof the popular doctriae of the Atonement, the discussion\nof Reincarnation and the \" Occult.\" Imperatorp is prac-\ntically sUent on the subject of Biblical history during this\nphase of teaching, and does not refer to his own dependence\non EUjah when he mentions his mission, two points which\nwere very prominent in the messages of Stainton Moses'\nprincipal Guide. It is true that the original Imperator\ndid claim that his mission was part of a movement under\nthe leadership of Jesus, but he never ventured to claim\nthe close connection with God which Imperatorp asserts.\n(21) Miss Newton, the Secretary of the Society for Psy-\nchical Research, to whom I mentioned the principal Hues\nof the teaching given by Imperatorp, suggested that the\nideas might be found in Dresser's The Power of Silence,\nLondon, 1898, which in her opinion Mrs. Piper had prob-\nably read. A perusal of that book shows considerable\nsimilarity between its contents and the thoughts expressed\nby Mrs. Piper's Band. Ideas of this kind were much in\nthe air at that period, and there is nothing improbable in\nthe theory that the subject-matter of the teaching may have\ncome from the mind of the medium or the sitter. Rector\np\nsaid on March 20th, 1905, \" Records \" page 492, that the\nBand took their words but not their thoughts from the\nsitters' minds, a statement which may point to their de-\npendence on the sitters' knowledge for the subject matter\n\f456 A. W. Trethewy. [part\nof their messages, though they Hmit thek obHgation to\nverbal expression.\n(22) This is a convenient place to mention some repKes\ngiven^,by Mrs. Piper's \" Controls \" to Dr. Savage's questions\nabout the nature of Jesus. On January 14th, 1903, page\n36, Dr. Savage was told by the communicating spirit, his\ndeceased son \" Phil,\" that Jesus was the son of Joseph\nand Mary. Rector corrected Phil immediately, stating that\nJesus was the \" Son of God \" . . .\n\" born of Mary in the\nbody but not as other mortals.\" Rector went on to say\nthat Jesus was not God or to be worshipped as God, but\nwas the son of Joseph, that He existed before birth and\nwas reincarnated. Rector then declared that God was\nnever visible in the spirit world, and was spirit, not a\nspirit, thus returning to what had been told to Mr. Z. on\nJanuary 5th, 1903. He went on to say that Christ was\nthe only mortal or spirit who was reincarnated, but ad-\nmitted, when reminded of the Band's earher teaching about\nMelchizedek, that Melchizedek had also been reincarnated.\nThen, apparently to explain the contradiction, he added\nthat Christ (Jesus) was the only Christ who had been\nreincarnated. These statements will be found in pp. 37\nto 40 of the typed records for January 14th, 1903. The\ndenial of the divinity of Jesus corresponds with the teach-\ning of Stainton Moses' Guides ; but the agreement on this\npoint is not a striking coincidence, for it is an opinion\nheld by many people, and the confusion and contradiction,\nas contrasted with the reasoned arguments of Stainton\nMoses' Imperator, deprive the incident of any weight as a\nproof of identity. On May 5th, 1903, \" Records \" page\n514, Mr. Z. was again told that Christ as well as Melchi-\nzedek was a reincarnation.\n(23) There are some minor points which deserve notice as\nbearing on the question of the identity of the \" Controls\n\"\nof the two mediums. Those which are favourable to the\nclaim of Mrs. Piper's Band will first be discussed.\n(a) There is some resemblance in the rehgious atmosphere\nwhich surrounds each band, especially marked in their\nfrequent prayers. It is possible, however, that in Mrs.\nPiper's case this trait may have been imitated, for Hodgson\n\fxcv.] Mrs. Piper and the Imperator Band. 457\nexplained to her Imperator* s relation vnih Stainton Moses,\nand gave her a copj' of Spirit Teachings to read (Vol.\nXX^7III. page 100). The style of the prayers in her\nscript may have been borrowed from that source ; the\nexpression \" All-wise \" used by her occurs there too. That\nbook was also famihar to Hodgson, no doubt.\n(b) The serious characters of Imperator p and Rector p,\nand the deference paid to the former by the latter as\ndescribed by Hyslop in Vol. XVI. page 181, agree with\nthe traits of the \" Controls \" of Stainton Moses bearing the\nsame names. It is possible, of course, that the dramati-\nsation or personation was based on the contents of Spirit\nTeachings, or even on Myers' articles in Vols. IX. and XI.\nof the Proceedings of the S.P.R., with which the sitter was\nprobably famihar.\n(c) Mr. Z. was told on January 15th, 1900, \" Records\n\"\npp. 62, 63 :\n\" Neither do we pretend to see aU that goes\non in the material . . . but on aU the points on which\nwe speak, we are cognisant of the truth, . . . our knowledge\nis knowledge and not conjecture.\" A similar claim was\nmade by Stainton Moses' Guides.\n{d) What Doctorp said to Hodgson on February 8th,\n1899, about having been with him as a silent helper (Vol.\nXVI. pp. 376, 377) his predecessor with the same name\nasserted to Stainton Moses.\n(e) ]Mrs. Piper's Band commended the character of Mr.\nZ.'s mother in terms which remind one of the high apprecia-\ntion of ]Mrs. Speer's attitude expressed by Stainton Moses'\nGuides. See January 15th, 1900, \" Records \" page 64.\n(\/) The admonitions given to Hodgson about his failings\nrecall the tendency of Stainton Moses' \" Controls \" to take\nhim to task for similar infirmities of temperament. See\n\" Records,\" February 20th, 1899, pp. 93, 94, and November\n3rd, 1902, pp. 861 to 863.i\nig) On February 19th, 1902, \" Records \" pp. 208, 209,\n^ Hodgson was much impressed by the advice which he received from\nthe \" Controls.\" On January 30th, 1901, \" Records \" p. 30, he told them :\n\" I believe that I feel that what you have already done for my spirit\nis worth more than all, even should God's guidance stop this communi-\ncation and I should never hear from you again.\"\n\f458 A. W. Trethewy. [part\nRectorp told Hodgson that Mrs. Piper harmed herself by\nteaching too much, and on Hodgson's expressing surprise\nadmitted that he might be confusing her with Stainton\nMoses, who had injured his health in this way.^ This state-\nment may have originated from confusion of ideas produced\nby the sitter's knowledge of the case of Stainton Moses,\n(24) The minor points unfavourable to the claim of\nidentity are stated below :\n(a) The style of conversation adopted by Mrs. Piper's\n\" Controls \" with sitters is sometimes quite out of keeping\nwith the manner observed by Stainton Moses' Guides in\naddressing him. Perhaps such practices as the use of the\nsecond person singular and of \" Sabbath \" for Sunday with\nher, but not with him, may be attributed plausibly to the\ninfluence of the medium's mind. The same explanation will\nhardly fit such a contrast as is brought out in the con-\nversation quoted in Vol. XXVIII. page 93, where Imperatorp\nrepeatedly addresses Hodgson as \" Sir,\" using the word\napparently in the obsequious and not the American sense.\nOne cannot imagine Stainton Moses' Imperator talking in\nthis way. For the strange use of \"Sir\" byjRectorp, see\nalso page 147 id. See also February 2nd, 1897, \" Records\n\"\npage 17, where Rector p uses the inappropriate expression,\n\" Very truly yours.\"\n(b) In 1897 \" Records,\" on March 19th, page 172, and\nApril 1st, page V 2, Rectorp excused himself for confused\nwriting by alleging that it was difficult for him to express\nImperator'sp words. This attitude was quite different from\nthat of Stainton Moses' Rector, who professed to be in\nperfect rapport with Imperator and to act with facihty as\nhis amanuensis, but to experience difficulty in understand-\ning and expressing the thoughts of some other spirits who\nconstituted \" the Mystic Band.\" Perhaps some allowance\n^ This is the last of the references of the \" Controls \" to their associ-\nation with Stainton Moses that I have noticed in looking through the\nrecords of Hodgson's period. In Vol. XXIII. page 235, Sir Oliver Lodge\nstates: \"Whatever relationship may exist between these personages and\nthe corresponding ones of Stainton Moses, there is little or no identity\n. . . it would appear as if they did \u2022\nnot very seriously pretend to be\nidentical.\" It seems, therefore, probable that after Hodgson's time their\nclaim to identity was dropped, or at any rate not asserted.\n\fxcv.] Mrs. Piper and the Itnperator Band. 459\nshould be made for him in this matter, because the state-\nment was made before he and Imperatorp had developed\nproperly ; see paragraph 13.\n(c) On June 29th, 1898, \" Records \" for May, page 358,\nMrs. Piper gave a clairvoyant description of Imperatorp:\n\" Tall, looking like a priest, with no hair on his face. He\nwas dressed in long flowing garments looking like soft white\nsilk, and had a silver cross on his breast, hung by a cord\n. . . and had a halo about his head.\" This does not\ncorrespond with the description given of the prophet\nMalachi, who Stainton Moses' Imperator professed to be.\nSee Controls of Stainton Moses.\n{d) On January 11th, 1900, \"Records \" page 52, Hodgson\nwas told : \"In Moses' case we were unable to use the voice\nat all, or very vaguely \" ; and a similar statement was made\nto him on March 4th, 1901, page 174. As a matter of\nfact, Stainton Moses used to give trance addresses at\nseances, and his voice was freely used in this way by\nImperator and other personages. This inaccuracy seems\nto me very important. The only explanations consistent\nwith the claim of identity that occur to me as possible are\neither that the subliminal mind of Mrs. Piper distorted the\nstatement, or that, as has sometimes been alleged in spirit\ncommunications, spirits using one medium are unable to\nrecall their former experiences with another. Neither ex-\nplanation seems satisfactory.\n(e) In Vol. XXVIII. page 95, it is stated that Doctor\np\nwrote a large and heavy script. Now the script used by\nStainton Moses' \" Doctor \" was remarkably smaU and fine,\nrequiring the use of a magnifying glass sometimes for\nfacility in reading it. Perhaps this difference may be due\nto the difference of the medium, but the omission to refer\nto it and explain it is unsatisfactory.\n(25) In my opinion a comparison of paragraphs 23 and\n24 shows a balance against the claim to identity. The\nsimilarities noticed in paragraph 23 can be accounted for\nrather easily as due to coincidence or to the knowledge in\nthe minds of the medium and the sitter. Even without\nthese deductions their value is not high. It is more diffi-\ncult to find satisfactory excuses for the inaccuracies set\n\f460 A. W. Trethewy. [part\nforth in paragraph 24, and the points at issue are more\ndefinite as tests.\n(26) The five \" Controls \" of Mrs. Piper who profess\nto have been Stainton Moses' Guides were Imperatorp,\nRectorp, Doctorp, Prudensp, and Mentorp. His Guides\nbearing the same pseudonyms alleged to him that they\nhad been the following persons in their lives on earth :\nImperator, the Prophet Malachi ;\nRector, Hippolytus, Bishop\nof Portus near Rome ;\nDoctor, the Stoic Philosopher Atheno-\ndorus ;\nPrudens, the Neo-Platonist Plotinus ;\nMentor, the\nArabian Ghazali or Algazzali. Mrs. Piper's \" Controls\n\"\ndid not give the same account of themselves. From what\nHyslop wrote in Vol. XVI. pp. 262 et seq., they do not\nseem to have been much pressed on the subject of their\npast history, but to have been accepted as helpers on\naccount of their successful management of the medium, a\nmore important matter than their personality. To the few\nquestions that were put to them about their earthly names,\nthey gave answers that did not agree with the claims\nof Stainton Moses' Guides. Without laying too much\nstress on the statements made at an early stage of their\ndevelopment (see paragraph 13), I will merely say that the\nsubstitution of other names with IMi's. Piper for those\nwhich they had claimed with Stainton Moses can hardly\nbe explained by forgetfulness of earth life or diSerence of\nmediums. If the personahties were really identical, the\nfailure to get the right names through the medium might\nperhaps be inteUigible, but no plausible excuse occurs to\nme for the invention of such wrong names as Dante,\n\" Lidgates,\" Homer, and Ulysses. To pass on to later\nstatements, Rector said in 1907 that his name had been\nFrancis (see Vol. XXVIII. page 110). His ignorance of\nLatin (see page 110 id. and Vol. XXII. page 314, and\nVol. XXVI. page 150) seems incompatible with the role\nof Hippolytus, who lived in Italy in the third century a.d.\nThere is frequent reference to Plotinus in Vol. XXII. in\nconnection with a cross-correspondence about a passage in\nhis writings, and to Prudens as a trance personaUty of Mrs.\nPiper, but there is no recognition of any relation between\nthe two, a significant omission.\n\fxcv.] Mrs. Pij)er and the Imperator Band. 461\n(27) In paragraph 5 it has been stated that for the\npurpose of this article it is assumed that the \" Controls\n\"\nof Stainton Moses and Mrs. Piper respectively were spirits\nwith independent existence, and not merely creations of the\nmedium's subUminal mind. Summing up the case on this\nbasis, I find that the mternal evidence points to the two\ngroups not having been identical. There are, it is true,\nslight resemblances, but they are either so vague as to be\nwell within the sphere of coincidence where two good\nbands of controls are concerned, or they are of a nature\nto suggest an origin from the mind of Mrs. Piper or her\nsitter. On the other hand, the ignorance and the errors of\nher \" Controls \" concerning the earth-lives of the Guides of\nStainton Moses whose names they bore, and concerning\nimportant features of his mediumship, are altogether in-\nconsistent with their claim to identity. A considerable\ndegree of oblivion might be excused, but the mistakes do\nmore than weaken the case, they justify a finding that the\nclaim is false. The force of this argument does not seem\nto be diminished if it is conceded that Stainton Moses'\nGuides may not have told him their right names of earthly\nlife ; for even so, if they had become attached to Mrs.\nPiper and claimed to have been associated with him, they\nwould surely have adhered to their former stories and\ngiven correct accounts of his mediumship. There is only\none difficulty which occurs to me in rejecting the claim.\nIt is hard to see why spirits whose objects are good should\nteU lies about their antecedents. One conceivable expla-\nnation, of course, is that the \" Controls \" of Mrs. Piper\nhad not independent existences, but were creations of her\nsubliminal mind. Another is that they were separate\nspirits, and that they personated Stainton Moses' Guides,\nwishing to do good to the medium and sitters and feeling\nthat this was the easiest way to obtain siiccess, the end\njustifying the means. The doubt about this point is\nsimilar to the failure to discover a plausible motive for a\ncrime, a failure which is not necessarily a bar to conviction.\n(28) Hyslop's position, as far as I can understand it,\nmay be noticed briefly. From his article in Vol. XVI.,\ndated October 1901, he seems to have reserved his opinion\n2a\n\f462 A. W. Trethewy. [part\nas to the personalities of Mrs. Piper's \" Controls,\" but to\nhave favoured the view that they were independent spirits,\nthough there was no proof of identity (pp. 177 et seq.,\n262-267). This seems to have been still his view in 1910\n(see Vol. IV. of the Proceedings of the American S.P.R.,\npp. 189, 196). In the American Journal, Vol. X. page\n265 (May 1916), he quoted Imperator's name as Malachi.\nThere, and in Vol. XI. id. page 76 (1917), he argued that\n\" Malachi,\" according to a certain Hebrew scholar, was\nnot the name of a prophet at aU, but a word for \" mes-\nsengers,\" a term by which Imperatorp described Mmself and\nhis Band, and that therefore it might be said that the\nsame name was given through both mediums. In Vol.\nXI. page 76, however, he dropped this point, and con-\ntinued :\n\" The proper name that I have obtained for him\nthrough Mrs. iSmead and Mrs. Chenoweth, and which also\ncame through Mrs. Piper and Stainton Moses, is of a well-\nknown historical character m the Christian Church of early\ntimes.\" I think that by Stainton Moses he must here\nmean Stainton Moses p, because the real Stainton Moses in\nhis life-time left no record of any other name than\nMalachi for Imperator. He does not seem to have changed\ngreatly his opmions of 1901, but to have become slightly\nmore inclined to the theory of the identity of the two\ngroups of \" Controls,\" and not to have discussed the pos-\nsibihty of the Piper group being spirits external to her\nand falsely personating Stainton Moses' Guides.\nIn Vol. XI. of the Journal of the American S.P.R. is\nan article by Raynes supporting Hyslop's views against the\nopinions of Mrs. Sidgwick expressed in Vol. XXVIII. of\nthe Proceedings of the English S.P.R. He apparently\nconsiders Juhus Caesarp to be a \"mischievous fool of a\nspirit \" impersonating Juhus Caesar (page 139). He criti-\ncizes Mrs. Sidgwick because she \" nowhere entertains the\npossibihty of spirit personation except in the vaguest\npossible way\" (page 142). Hyslop, as I have stated above,\nhas not dealt with this question in any of his writings\nthat I have read. As Hyslop had so much experience of\nMrs. Piper's mediumship, his views are of interest ; but as\nhe seems to have come to no conclusion on the question\n\fxcv.] Mrs. Piper and the Imperator Band. 463\nof identity, I do not think it necessary to discuss them\nfurther.\n(29) In paragraph 5 I have said that the question to be\ndiscussed is whether Mrs. Piper's \" Controls \" were identical\nwith those of Stainton Moses, and not who or what they\nwere if the answer to the question is in the negative.\nPerhaps, however, a few remarks on the light thrown by\nHodgson's records on the nature and origin of the Band\nmay be interesting to the readers of this article. There is\nat least a superficial appearance of personalities external to\nMrs. Piper.\n(a) The dialogue between the \" Controls \" and the spirits\ncommunicating through them with the sitter may, of course,\nbe the result of dramatisation on the part of the medium's\nsubliminal mind, but on some occasions it seems to offer\nconvincing evidence of the presence of independent external\npersonalities, e.g. on June 17th, \" Records \" pp. 691 et\nseq., and November 10th, 1902, \" Records \" pp. 869 et\nseq. Two of Miss Pope's (Theodate) seances furnish sup-\nport on other lines to this theory. On May 18th, 1904,\n\" Records \" page 786, she told G.

Carl Bbuck of\nBerlin. 80 pages and 22 illustrative plates, published at\nStuttgart, 1925, with a short preface by Mrs Sidgwick\n(who, however, was not present at any of the experiments),\nand an interesting introduction by Dr. Arthur Kronfeld\nwho was present at a considerable number and is able\nto testify to the care with which they were conducted.\nThis book is chiefly a detailed account and discussion of 114\nexperiments in the transference of drawings and diagrams\n(including a few prints) carried out by Dr. Bruck, he being\nhimself the \" agent \" throughout, and it is an important and\nvaluable contribution to the evidence for telepathy. Dr.\nBruck prefers to speak of \" Versuchsleiter \" and \" Versuchs-\nperson \" (which we may perhaps translate \" experimenter\n\"\nand \" experimentee \") rather than agent and percipient on the\nground that in telepathic experiments we do not know which\nof the two persons concerned plays the active part. This is\ntrue and has been pointed out at various times in our Pro-\nceedings, but it is an objection to Dr. Brack's alternative\nnames, that they are not applicable in spontaneous cases\nnor even in all experimental ones. Of the experiments 111\nwere carried out systematically between July 1922 and Feb-\nruary 1923 with four young men as percipients who were all\neasily hypnotisable. The remaining three experiments were\nmade separately with other percipients. The degree of success,\nwhich was clearly beyond what chance might produce, can\nbest be judged by inspection of the illustrative plates, which\ngive the originals and reproductions in most of the distinctly\nsuccessful cases, besides giving some others to illustrate\npoints discussed m. the text.\n\fxcv.] Reviews. 467\nDr. Brack's reason for experimenting with easily hypnotis-\nable persons was that he wished to form an opinion on the\nquestion whether telepathic percipience is assisted by hypnoti-\nsation or not. He generally woke the hypnotised percipient\nafter each experiment, and frequently tried alternate experi-\nments with the percipient awake and hypnotised. On the\nwhole he concluded that the hypnotised state appeared to be\nadvantageous by faciUtating concentration. But it seemed to\nhave disadvantages also, leading, for example, in some cases\nto repetition of an impression when a new one should have\ncome.\nDr. Bruck devoted much care to the method of experi-\nmenting, especially with a view to excluding the possibility\nof normal seeing of the drawing to be transferred. As a\ngeneral rule he went into another room and either selected\none out of a large number of previously prepared drawings,\netc. (which he kept entirely in his own control unseen by\nothers) or occasionally used one drawn on the spur of the\nmoment by himself\u2014or by a friend assisting in the experi-\nment. After looking at the selected drawing and fixing it\nin his mind, he placed it in a portfolio (Mappe) held in his\nhand and took it into the room where the percipient was.\nIn many of the experiments it remained in the portfolio\nthroughout and was therefore obviously invisible to either the\npercipient or any other persons who might be present. But\nDr. Bruck thought at first, though he seems to have modified\nthis view later, that he could help the telepathic process by\ncontinuous concentration of his own mind on the object to be\ntransferred, and being a bad visualiser, and the time occupied\nby an experiment being often long, he found such concentration\ndifficult without constant re-inspection of the object. He\ntherefore in many of his experiments took his drawing from\ninside the portfolio and placed it on the top so as to be able\nto look at it. These he called open {offen) experiments, the\nothers bemg described as portfolio {Mappen) experiments. It\nis, we think, a pit}- that he does not describe any general\nmethod of screening the drawing from observation by others\nin \" open \" experiments. He gives, however, in detail the\nprecautions in some cases and is obviously so careful that\none cannot doubt that the precautions were adequate in all.\n\f468 Reviews. [part\nMoreover, the results do not seem to indicate any compara-\ntively greater success in \" open \" experiments than ia \" port-\nfolio \" ones. We may remark that Dr. Bruck devotes par-\nticular attention to the danger of reflection from any shining\nsurface and particularly from eye glasses and even the cornea.\nWe cannot in a short review examine the variations in his\nexperiments introduced by Dr. Bruck in hopes of throwing\nsome Ught on the process of telepathic perception. The\nnumber of experiments was not sufficient to establish much\nexcept the general fact of success beyond chance, but he made\nobservations of a useful and suggestive kind. One thing\nthat interested him was the occasional deferment of the\npercipient's impression, and rather curiously he classes with\ndeferment a case of apparent anticipation. It was an\n\" open \" experiment, but he had put into his portfolio\nthree drawings which he intended to use in succession\nin the same series. The drawing selected for immediate\nexperiment represented a medicine bottle. The percipient\ngot as far as what looked like the cork and the rim of the\nneck of the bottle^ and then stopped, putting down his pencil.\nContrary to his usual practice, Dr. Bruck urged him to go on,\nwhereupon he started afresh and drew a street lamp which\nwas a remarkably good reproduction of the second of the three\ndrawings in the portfolio. This can be regarded as in a\nsense an anticipation of an intended experiment, but to us it\nseems rather a confirmation of the view that great concentra-\ntion by the agent on the subject to be transferred was not a\nnecessity or even imj)ortant. He had just selected the drawing\nof the street lamp for experiment in the series begun with the\nmedicine bottle. It was therefore in his mind, and from his\nmind the percipient probably got it.\nDr. Bruck has the advantage of being not only a good\nexperimenter, but hunself a good agent. He does not dwell\non this, and Ave are not sure whether he accepts the view\nthat it is not everyone Avho can transfer thoughts and impres- \u2022\nsions to a percipient, or\u2014to put it otherwise\u2014whose mind lies\nopen to a percipient trying to get an impression from it. ,]\n^ As will be perceived, it also resembled a top hat, and as the percipient\ncould not always interpret correctly his own drawings, he may have regarded\nit as a competent drawing of a hat.\n\fxcv.] Reviews. 469\nAs he has this power, we are glad to note that he hopes to\nfmd opportunities of further experimenting, and that he will\nthus add to our knowledge of telepathy as well as to the\nevidence for it\u2014as the experinients published iii this book\ncertaiuly do.\nII\nI. Grundversuche auf dem Gebiete der fsycMschen Grenzwissenscliaften.\nBy Prof. Dr. Christoph Schroder. Berlin, 1924, Pyramiden-\nverlag. Dr. Schwarz & Co. Pp. 66.\nIt would seem that among the results of the War and the Revo-\nlution in Germany has been an effective breaking down of the\nofficial tabus formerly imposed on psychical research or \" occultism,\"\nas the Germans prefer to call it, in that country. At any rate\nthere now appear to be a number of competent inquirers and\ninvestigating societies in Germany, who do not find it impossible\nto engage the attention of scientific people and to get their re-\nsearches pubhshed by several new pubHshers. They have already\nproduced a considerable hterature, which is in the main a record of\ncareful experiments in \"telepathy,\" \"clairvoyance,\" and \" psychom-\netry,\" as well as in the more spiritistic tjrpe of phenomena, and\nis decidedly impressive. Among these researches Prof. Schroder's\nbook deserves to rank high. It forms the first pubUcation of the\nGerman Society for Scientific Occultism, and is composed for the\nmost part of the (very concisely written) original notes of a syste-\nmatic series of the experiments at 68 sittings with 6 sensitives (two\nmen and four women, and all apparently unpaid) in Berlin, from\nFebruary 1920 to September 1921. Prof. Schroder set himself to\ntest whether the supernormal knowledge shown by his sensitives\ncould possibly be ascribed either to hyperaesthesia, or to telepathy ;\nbut though he started with a prepossession in favour of the former,\nand at first seemed to get corroboration for it, finally arrived at\nresults which he (not unreasonably) claims, entirely exclude both\nthese hypotheses, as weU as merely fortuitous success. Towards\nthe end he had so trained his sensitives, who were generally in a\nstate of light hypnosis, that they could in total darkness pick out\ncorrectly (in about three cases out of four) one out of five or six\nobjects, such as visiting cards on one of which an imaginary\npicture or coin had been impressed (for them) by suggestion, or\nsuch as empty bottles of which one was supposed to be filled with\n\f470 Reviews. [part xcv.\notto of roses, after these objects had been so shuffled by various\npeople that no one present knew which was the marked object,\nand this moreover without the object being even touched by the\nsensitive ! What renders his record peculiarly instructive is that\nhe shows us how he gradually developed his technique, and found\nout the sort of tests that were practicable, and then tried them,\nwith approximately equal success, upon his various sensitives. It\nmust be admitted that Prof. Schroder's methods do not appear to\nbe open to any very obvious objection, and that none of the ex-\nplanations ordinarily suggested seem to apply to his results, though\nit seems decidedly sanguine on his part to suppose (p. 65) that\nthey cannot possibly, in view of their impersonal character, be\nascribed to inspiration by \" spirits.\" It certainly appears an odd\noccupation for a dead man (or a devil) supranormally to observe\non which of a number of visiting cards a hallucinatory image had\nbeen suggested to a sensitive in order supranormally to prompt the\nlatter in identifying this card ; but then this oddity is in no way\nremoved by Prof. Schroder's only theoretic suggestion (p. 63),\nwhich postulates a potential omniscience to be drawn on in an\nemergency. Perhaps it is wisest to admit that for the moment,\nin psychical research as in physics, experimental observation has\noutstripped theory ; we shall be all the readier to appreciate the\ningenuity and tact which have enabled Prof. Schroder to obtain\nhis remarkable results.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART XCVI\nA REPORT ON SOME COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED\nTHROUGH MRS. BLANCHE COOPER.\nBy S. G. SOAL, M.A., B.Sc.\nIntroduction. . ,\nThe object of the present paper is to discuss a series of\nexperiments and observations carried out during the years\n1921-1922 with a direct voice medium, Mrs. Blanche\nCooper, who practises at the British College of Psychic\nScience. The sittings, which began on September 1,\n1921, were with occasional lapses held once a week until\nthe following June. I will say at the outset that my\nstudies of IVIrs. Cooper were concerned entirely with mental\nphenomena and do not touch at all upon the physical\naspects of the case. If one sets out to investigate mental\nphenomena one is perhaps justified in ignoring those\nphysical concomitants which belong properly to the pro-\nvince of the expert physicist or the expert physiologist.\nI am not, therefore, interested in the question as to\nwhether the voices heard at Mi's. Cooper's seances are\ntruly independent or are produced by the exercise of her\nordinary vocal apparatus. It does not matter from my\npoint of view if Mrs. Cooper holds the trumpet to her\nmouth and speaks into it in the ordinary way, since I am\nnot concerned at all mth how the voice is produced but\nsimply with what the voice says and with any charac-\nteristic intonations which it may possess. But whatever\nmay be the physiological explanation of the voices it is\n\f472 S. G. Soal. [part\ncertain that they involve a degree of mental dissociation\nand present many of the usual stigmata of unconscious\nmental phenomena. The medium does not go into trance\nand in the intervals when the voice is not speaking she\nis apparently normal and able to converse with the sitters,\nand sometimes even able to repeat words which the voice\nhas just said. There is, however, right through the\nsitting a certain degree of absent mindedness and the\nmedium is sometimes slow to respond to questions ad-\ndressed to her by the sitter. While the voice ^ is not\nspeaking she keeps up a continuous humming noise with\nher lips, and this humming ceases when the voice comes\ninto play. Throughout the period of my own experiments\nthe medium seemed unable to sustam the voice for more\nthan a minute or two at a time, and the information\nwas given for the most part in rapid snatches, punctuated\nby periods of silence lasting from a minute up to a\nquarter of an hour.\nMoreover, it appeared that the voice could only be\nproduced while the musical box was playing, and only\non one or two occasions were words spoken a second or\ntwo after the music had ceased. Objective lights were\nseen at every sitting, but these appeared in the silent\nintervals and were never simultaneous with the voices.\nThese lights varied in appearance from dim amorphous ,\npatches to bright bluish discs about the size of a half ;\ncrown. When one attempted to touch them, even without\nAvarning the medium, the hghts invariably receded in the\ndirection of the cabinet. In the light there often appeared\nthe dark outlines of the upper half of the four fingers\nof a hand which may well have been the right hand of\nthe medium which was free.\nMethods of Transmission. j\nThe mechanism by which ideas are transmitted through )\nthe mediumship of Mrs. Cooper seems to be somewhat dif- ]\nferent from that used by a trance personality like Feda '\nin the seances of Mrs. Leonard. My own experience of\n^ I have no record of any occasion on which two or more voices\nappeared to speak at the same time.\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 473\nMrs. Leonard is limited, but judging from the few sittings\nI have had and from reading the long series of reports of\nLady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall, it would appear\nthat the method by which ideas are presented to Feda is\nin the main ^ a pictographic one. Feda sees pictures and\nfrom these pictures she has to try to build up a story\nthat will be intelligible to the sitter. Now my experience\nwith Mrs. Cooper rather strongly suggests that her uncon-\nscious mind and the co-conscious personalities which exist\nwithin it are concerned very little if at all with the\nreceiving and interpretation of visual impressions. On\nthe contrary the function of her automatism seems to\nbe the transmission of aiulitory impressions.^ Mrs. Cooper\ngives names and phrases which I am convinced could\nawaken in her subconscious mind nothing beyond\nthe mere sound of the words themselves. At Sitting\nNo. 31, for instance, the control Nada pronounced the\nname \" Shagoian \" quite clearly and almost perfectly.\nIn giving this name Nada simply said \" Something from\nyour brother which you will understand.\" Asked what it\nmeant she said she did not know. It was the name of\na student of mine, Mr. Armenag Shagoian, whom I had\nbeen coaching in mathematics for several weeks previous\nto the sitting. This apparent direct transmission of word-\nsounds seems to extend not only to individual words like\n\" Starbobs \" [Sitting No. 6, p. 499], but sometimes to whole\nphrases, which give the impression that they have been\nheard and faithfully reproduced in some mysterious manner.\nThus in Sitting No. 13 [p. 506] there is the phrase \"grove\ngate \" used to describe a certain gate near our old home\nat Stambridge. It was the expression invariably used by\n^ Feda, of course, does on occasion get auditory impressions and even\nolfactory sensations, but I think most students will agree with me that\nher method is in the main a method of visual pictures. The expression\n\" She's showing Feda something \" constantly occurs in the various reports\nof her utterances.\n* The writer has since learned from a reliable soiu'ce that on one occasion\nat which Mrs. Cooper's sitters were Dutch people some fragments of\nDutch\u2014a language with which Mrs. Cooper is quite imfamiliar\u2014were\ncommunicated. This fact rather supports the theory of the transmission\nof audile verbal imagery.\n\f474 S. G. Soal. [part\nthe members of our family when they wished to refer to\nthis particular gate, and probably by no one else in the neigh-\nbourhood except perhaps a few boys like Walter Valentine\nand Percy Paternoster who had learnt the phrase from us. ;\nHad Feda been aiming at a reference to this same gate\nshe would probably have seen a field with a path leading\nfrom it to a wood and then perhaps have noticed that\nthe wood consisted mostly of tiny trees with some bigger\nones and that there was a gate near the bigger ones.\nBoth methods doubtless have their own peculiar advan-\ntages. For while Mrs. Cooper's terse phrase \" grove\ngate \" has a definiteness that no general pictorial descrip-\ntion could ever attain, Feda, on the other hand, while\ntaking longer to arrive at her destination, would perhaps\nhave given many more collateral facts in the process of\ngetting there.\nThe direct voice seldom speaks in complete sentences.\nShort condensed phrases are the rule and by this means a\ngreat deal of ground is covered in a short time.\nQuestions asked by the sitter are seldom answered im-\nmediately in the case when the sitter is holding the correct\nanstver in his conscious mind. In such cases ^ it was ;\nusually found that the idea had to pass back into the\nunconscious mind of the sitter before it could emerge\nfrom the automatism of the medium. The communi-\ncator, when asked for an answer, would usually reply,\n\" I cannot give it now, but will try to give it later.\" ;\nThen at a later period of the sitting when the sitter had ;\nquite forgotten the matter in question the correct answer . \\\nwould be forthcoming. In cases when the correct answer ]\nwas not known to the sitter a direct question would often\nresult in immediate success ; such instances are to be found\non p. 542, Sitting No. 18, J. F.'s answers ;\nSitting No. 20 \\\nItem No. 17 [p. 563] ;\nSitting No. 21 Item No. 47 [p. 565].\nIn considering the output of the present series of sittings\nit must be borne in mind that we are dealing with the\nresults obtained through a combination of two psychic\npersonalities. The sitter is himself an automatic writer\nand is therefore\u2014at least to some extent \u2014 subject to\niCf. p. 496, 1. 14.\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 475\ndissociation, although he did not develop automatic writing\nuntil a year after the direct voice sittings were finished.\nIt is, I think, now generally admitted that a degree of\nmental dissociation in the mind of the sitter is one of the\ndetermining factors in the production of supernormal infor-\nmation. That is to say, a sitter who is himself medium-\nistic will in general be more successful with mediums\nthan another sitter will be who is quite undissociated.\nThis fact of mental dissociation on the part of a sitter\ndoes not, however, seem to account for the variations of\nsuccess which are encountered by the same sitter in experi-\nments with different mediums. Personal sympathy between\nmedium and sitter, though a most helpful factor, does not\nseem in itself always sufficient to ensure results. The\npresent writer found for instance that while he \" got on\n\"\nvery well indeed with a certain well-lmown clairvoyant, yet\nthe output of supernormal knowledge was extremely meagre.\nOne may suggest that success will depend at least to\nsome extent on the fact of the medium and sitter pos-\nsessing the same predominant types of mental representation.\nIf the transmission of ideas and images from the mind of\nthe subject to that of the medium plays any important\npart in the mental process, we should expect such simi-\nlarity as I have mentioned to be a vital factor. The\nwriter himself is a good \" visual \" and an indifferent\n\" audile,\" but he possesses in addition an exceptional\ntendency to visualise words and to articulate them\ninaudibly. Thus, if someone suggests to him the idea of\na mountain, he will see in his mind first a picture of\na mountain and next he will usually see the word\n\" mountain \" spell itself out in white letters. Then,\nas often as not, he will find himself saying the word\n\" mountain \" inaudibly to himself. This predominance of\nverbal imagery in the mind of the sitter may possibly\naccount for his success with a direct voice medium in\ncomparison with the interesting though less striking results\nhe obtained with mediums whose method is largely picto-\ngraphic.\nIt is hoped in the near future to secure the co-operation\nof the large number of people who have had sittings\n\f476 8. G. Soal. [part\nwith Mrs. Cooper in order to ascertain if any correlation\nexists between types of mental imagery in the sitter and\nsuccess with the medium.\nThe Medium's Subject Matter.\nAs is the case with most professional mediums the\ncommunications obtained through Mrs. Cooper are of\npsychological rather than of intrinsic interest. Her super-\nnormal faculties exercise themselves almost entirely on\ncertain trivial aspects of the lives of deceased personalities.\nIn rare cases, however, the subject which the medium\ndescribes may be a living person whom the medium has\nmistaken for a dead person. In the important case of\n\" Gordon Davis,'' it will appear that except for the\nmysterious prevision of the future house the same kind of\nfacts are given about a living personality as are given\nabout a personality that has once lived. In no case did\nthe medium's trance-consciousness occupy itself with\nsubjects of intellectual or artistic interest.\nCharacteristic Qualities of the Voices.\nThe voices produced at Mrs. Cooper's seances show\nvariations in pitch and timbre to correspond with the\ndifferent personalities which are supposed to be communi-\ncating. Thus, when a young boy communicates, the voice\ntakes on a boyish intonation and alters somewhat in\npitch, and similarly in the case of a j^'oung girl. Some\nfiindamental quality of Mrs. Cooper's own normal voice is,\nI think, to be observed in all the voices. In the case\nof my deceased brother who was the most frequent\ncommunicator, I could not recognise the voice produced\nat the seance as the normal earthly voice I had known.\nThe general pitch was perhaps the same, but the voice\nitself I could not identify. It is of interest, however,\nto note that in the case of my brother a \" seance voice\n\"\nwas developed which preserved certain marked character-\nistics so that immediately this particular voice spoke I was\nable to recognise it as the voice intended for my brother.\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 4:l'i\nEven in the ease of a purely fictitious communicator like\n\" John Ferguson \" the voice conserved the same individual\nquahties from seance to seance. Only in the case of the\nliving communicator \" Gordon Davis \" did the voice really\nremind me of the living person. I am unable to say\nwhether the voices of \" James Miles \" and of \" Benson \" ^\nresembled those of the real persons for the simple reason\nthat I was never acquainted with them. There was\ncertainly an asthmatic hoarseness to be noticed in\nthe voice of the old man in the \" Benson \" case, and it\ntranspired, in fact, that he had suffered before his death\nfrom a chest complaint. There has to be considered,\nhowever, the possibility of certain qualities such as the\nasthmatic hoarseness in the \" Benson \" case and the very\nprecisely articulated utterance of \" Gordon Davis \" being-\nintroduced for the express purpose of conveying dramatically\ncertain facts about these 'particular personalities. That is,\nwe may suppose, that what was intended was not to give\na faithful reproduction of the voice of \" Gordon Davis\n\"\nin all its almost inimitable qualities, but merely to convey\nin this way certain facts about the man\u2014such as the fact\nthat he had cultivated a very precise accent, etc. Here is\nanother point to be noted. My brother during life spoke\nwith a rather marked North Country accent. No attempt\nwas ever made to reproduce this at the Cooper seances.\n^\nNada and Afid.\nThere are two voices which manifest at all of Mrs.\nCooper's seances. These call themselves \" Nada \" and\n\" Afid'' and purport to be Mrs. Cooper's guides and say\nthat their function is to look after the medium and to\nhelp the other communicators to manifest themselves.\nThe voice of \" Nada \" is a rapid girlish whisper ; the\nvoice of \" Afid \" is gruff and sepulchral, and was seldom\nheard until the very close of the seance, when he would\n^ The case of \" Benson \" is not discussed in the present paper.\n* The north country accent (Yorkshire) was, however, noticed at a\ntrance sitting with Mrs. Brittain on July 22, 1919, when my brother\npurported to communicate.\n\f478 S. G. Soal. [part\nannounce in nearly always the same formula that \"power\nis going.\" The voice of Nada was heard frequently\nduring the seance and often though not always spoke at\nthe commencement before the other direct communicators.\n\" Nada \" like \" Feda \" sometimes spoke in asides to the\ndirect communicators, giving them instructions not to forget\ncertain details, etc. She seems aware of things which\nhappen in the immediate environment of Mrs. Cooper, as\nwhen, for instance, she remarked that one of the medium's\npet mice had died. On one occasion \" Nada \" opened the\nseance by saying, \" what dreadful weather we are having.\"\nLike many other secondary personalities both \" Nada \"\nand \" Afid \" are under certain delusions concerning their\npasts and have come to beheve certain stories about\nthemselves which I do not think it necessary to repeat\nhere. Of the two controls \" Nada \" seemed the more\ndeveloped as an independent personality, and it is possible\nthat she may be a sort of resuscitation of Mrs. Cooper's\ngirlhood. \" Afid,\" on the other hand, with the sole\nexception of one occasion on which he advised me on my\nhealth and offered to send a \" spirit doctor \" to see\nme, whom he called \" Doctor Alder,\" remained silent\nduring the seances, only coming in at the end with his\ninvariable reminder that \" power is going.\" Supernormal\ninformation was sometimes volunteered by \" Nada,\" who\nprofessed to get it from the purporting communicator, but\nI found on the whole that information given by \" Nada \"\nwas slightly less reliable than when it came direct from the\ncommunicator himself. [In the \" Gordon Davis \" case,\n\" Nada \" is as rehable as \" G. D. \" himself.]\nGeneral Abstract of Experiments.\nSection 1 of my paper is devoted to a series of sittings\nat which the sole communicator was a deceased brother.\nIn addition to recording and analysing a large number of\nspontaneous communications I consider in this Section\ncertain experiments whose object was the obtaining of\nfacts that were unknown to the sitter.\nSection 2 is the study of what is perhaps the most\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 479\ninteresting of a number of fictitious communications. This\ncase of \"John Ferguson\" is very interesting as showing\nthe interplay between the minds of medium and sitter.\nThe study of such purely imaginary communicators affords,\nwe believe, a valuable method for observing the trans-\nference of ideas between sitter and psychic.\nIn Section 3 we discuss the case of \" James Miles,'\" a\nfictitious commxmicator of an entirely different tj^pe. This\ncase appears to emphasise the necessity of the existence\nof a physical link relating the sitter to the deceased per-\nsonality, and argues the impossibility of obtaining in the\nabsence of such a link information about a deceased\npersonality which is not already present in the mind of\nthe sitter.\nSection 4 deals with what is perhaps the most inter-\nesting case of the whole series. It is a case in which\na person believed by the sitter to be dead, communicates\nspontaneously through the direct voice. He reproduces\nmore or less accurately the tone of his voice, its accent\nand his characteristic mannerisms of speech. He describes\nincidents of his boyhood known to the sitter and speaks\nof one or two matters unknown to the sitter. Most\ninteresting of all he gives an accurate description of the\nenvironment and interior arrangements of a house ivhich\nhe did not occupy until a year later. Going back into the\npast he is able to reproduce accurately the place of his\nlast meeting with the sitter and the substance of the\nconversation. Further, he is dramatised as if he were\na deceased personality, desiring to send messages of\ncomfort to his wife and child. In the end we discover\nthat he is still hving. By means of a diary kept by him,\nwe are able to discover accurately just what he was doing\nat the times of the first two sittings.\nMethod of Taking Notes.\nOne difficulty presented itself at the outset of my\nexperiments. This was the difficulty of taking accurate\nverbatim notes of what was said both by mj^self and by\nthe voices at sittings which were held in total darkness,\n\f480 S. G. Soal. [part\nwhile the right hand of the sitter was held by the left\nhand of the medium the whole time. In the case when\na friend was introduced it was quite impossible to\ntake any notes at all while the sitting was in progress\nsince on these occasions neither of my hands was free.\nI soon found, however, that the difficulty was not\ninsuperable. The voices seldom spoke more than a few\nphrases at a time, and there were considerable pauses j\nduring which by means of a hard pad balanced on my \u2022\nknee, and using my left hand, I was able to take what I\nwere practically verbatim notes. But even had I been\n'\nentirely unable to take any notes while the sitting was\nin progress, the amount of matter which is given at\na sitting is always so very small that, for a person j\nwho is fortunate enough to possess as good a '\nmemory as my own, exact memorisation would be no 1\nvery difficult feat, especially if the sitter were keenly\n|\ninterested. In every case in which it was impossible to\n|\nmake exact notes during the sitting, memorised notes ]\nwere written out in pencil before leaving the seance room, i\nIt was not until the third sitting that I made any ;\nattempt to take notes with my left hand, but after this\n'\nsitting, unless a friend happened to be present, I invari-\nably used this method. Before the war I had the mis- i\nfortune to injure my right arm, and for a period of three i\nor four months I cultivated ambidexterity, writing letters 1\nand even lecture notes with considerable facility. I ;\nfound it, thex'efore, no very difficult feat to maintain a\nj\nstiff pad on my knees while writing with my left hand.\n^\nI found that the darkness itseLf presented no real difficulty\nwhatever. I could write as legibly in the dark as in the\nlight. Nothing in the way of rapid writing was needed\nas is the case with \" Feda \" talk.\nThe Communicator of Section 1.\nThe communicator of Section 1 purports to be the\nwriter's deceased brother, and a few words about his hfe\nhistory and subsequent psychic history may not be out\nof place.\nV\n\fxcvi.] Communications Th'ough Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 481\nMy youngest brother, Pte. Frank Soal, 6th Leicester\nRegiment, died in France at the age of nineteen, from\nwounds received in action on September 5, 1918. Of\nthe nature of his wounds, or how he received them, we\nknow httle, save that he appears to have been wounded\non September 1st, to have died four days later at a\nCasualty Clearing Station, and to have been buried in\nBagneux British Cemetery.\nBorn at Little Stambridge, near Rochford, Essex, on\nMarch 9, 1899, the earher part of his life up to his\nsixteenth year was associated almost entirely with the\nfields and trees of the Essex countryside. Until 1914 he\nlived at the old Rectory, Little Stambridge, two miles\nfrom the Railway Station at Rochford, but in the winter,\n1914-5, the family moved from these purely rural sur-\nroundings to Prittlewell, which is five miles away and a\nsuburb of Southend-on-Sea. In that same year, 1915,\nmy brother was apprenticed to a large firm of electrical\nengineers. Of a strongly scientific and constructive bent\nof mind he soon developed the keenest interest in electrical\nwork, and made excellent progress. He was essentially\nof a practical experimental type of mind, and not of the\ntype that could appreciate abstract symbohsm. Hence\nhe was never able to make much progress in mathematics.\nIn the last years of his life he developed in a remarkable\nway, showing unexpected interests and enthusiasms. At\neighteen years of age, in March, 1917, he joined the\nArmy, was a keen young soldier, and entered into his\ntraining with zest at Colchester, Sevenoaks, and Westport,\nIreland. He was sent to France in April, 1918. A\nmonth later he was slightly gassed, sent to the base for\na few weeks, returned to the Front and was killed in\nSeptember. I missed him keenly. About a year before\nhis death I had become interested in psychic research,\nbut being in the Army I had no opportunities for sittings,\nuntil I was demobilised in 1919. In April of that year\nI became a member of the London Spiritualist Alliance,\nand it was at one of the public meetings of this body\nthat I obtained my first personal experience of super-\nnormal faculty. This occurred on May 20, 1919, at an L.S.A.\n\f482 S. G. Soal. [part\nmeeting when IMrs. Annie Brittain was giving clairvoyant\nimpressions from the platform. I had never seen her\nbefore, and was sitting in the front row, when, towards\nthe end of the meeting, she turned to me and said, \" Do\nyou know Canuter ? or it might be Ganuder ?\n\" She did\nnot know if it were a place or a person. I replied,\n\" I think it is a Httle village I know well.\" She said,\n\" Well, there seems to be someone from there v\/ho wishes\nto speak to you.\" Nothing more was forthcoming then.\nNow \" Ganeivdon \" is a little village situated about three\nmiles from Stambridge on a low hill overlooking the\nmarshes of the Crouch. It is about two miles away from\nour old home, and we Uved within sight of the ancient\nflint church tower, which is a landmark for many miles\naround. Canewdon is, in fact, the next parish to Stam-\nbridge. M}^ own associations with this place are stronger\nthan in the case of my deceased brother, for when I was\nsix years old I walked there every day to a Kindergarten\nSchool held at the Rectory. My brother might have been\nthere once or twice in his life.\nI was so impressed with the medium getting this name\nthat I arranged with her by letter for a private sitting\nwhich took place twelve days later at her house at\n50 Westbourne Park Road. At this sitting, during which\nthe medium did not go into a trance, a very good des-\ncription of Frank's personal appearance was given together\nwith his name \" Frank.\" At the end of the sitting\nI recalled to Mrs. Brittain the \" Canuter \" incident and\nasked her how she came to give this word. She replied,\n\" Oh, that funny word ! I remember ! I will tell you.\nI saw a boy in an oak tree, or it might have been an\napple tree. He peeped over a branch and I heard him\nsay, '\nthis is Canuter,' but I could not tell that before\nall those people. They would have laughed at me. So\nI just said, '\ndo you know Ganuter ?\n' \" It is rather\ncurious that the name Ganeivdon has often been given at\nsittings. It appeared for instance at my first sitting with\nMrs. Leonard on March 28, 1922. I was accompanied\nto this sitting by Mr. B. E. C. Davis, M.A., Lecturer in\nEnglish Literature in the University of London, who made\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 483\nshorthand notes. During the train journey to Oakleigh\nPark, Mx. Davis, in a conversation about historical Essex,\nmentioned the fact that he had once visited Canewdon.\nI then related to him the above psj^chic incident. Towards\nthe end of the sitting with Mrs. Leonard, whom I had\nnever seen before that day, and who did not know my\nname, \" Feda,\" who had been describing a bridge, spoke\nas foUows :\nFeda. \" He (my brother) says the name \" C \" is connected\nwith it\u2014rather a long name\u2014its more than one\nsyllable\u2014(what's that) Canterbury no it can't be\nCanterbury\u2014Can\u2014Can\u2014Cana\u2014Cana\u2014Can\u2014Canadon.\n(I was careful to refrain from giving any assistance.\nS.

Try to describe the place, Feda.\nF. It seem as if it's away from London. Feda don't feel\nit's a toAvn\u2014a sort of place with wide spaces as\nif there were no shops or trams.\n[Note.\u2014This particular way of pronouncing the\nword by Feda is interesting. Throughout history\nthere have been many variations in the pronuncia-\ntion of the name of this vUlage ranging from\n\"Canweedon\" to \"Canudon\" and \" Cannadon.\"\nThe modem pronunciation is \" Can-u-don,\" the u\nbeing pronounced as in \" tube.\" Among the native\npeasantry of the place it is often spoken of as\n\" Cannadon \" exactly as given by Feda. Through\nmy early associations with the place I was perfectly\nfamiliar with this latter pronunciation, but I feel\ncertain that Frank would have said \" Can-u-don.\"\n'\nThe description of the place by Feda is rather\nvague, but the expressions \"funny people,\"\n\"conservative,\" \"looking upon themselves as a class\n\f484 S. 0. Soal. [part\napart,\" are all appropriate in a general way and\nsuggest an isolated community, a rather out-of-the-\nworld place. Canewdon is in fact four miles from\na railway station, and until recently there was at\nleast one inhabitant who had never been in a train.\nThe name \" Canewdon \" was again spelled out\nat an Ouija sitting with Mrs. Travers-Smith, held\nin May, 1923. At the time my hand was not\nresting on the slider.]\nAt a second sitting with Mrs. Brittain on July 22,\n1919, at which the medium went into a trance my brother\nagain purported to communicate, speaking a few words\nin the North Country accent we used at home. The\nsitting, however, was not very evidential. Fairly good\npersonal descriptions of my brother were given by Mrs.\nCannock and other platform clairvoyants, but no very\nremarkable evidence was secured until the present series\nof sittings with Mrs. Cooper.\nOn August 28, 1921, I received a letter from Mrs. B.\nM'Kenzie, Hon. Secretary of the British Psychic College,\ninforming me that a sitting with Mrs. Cooper had been\narranged for September 1st, and that I was at liberty to\nbring a friend. The question arises\u2014^How much could\nthe ofRcials of the Psychic College be expected to know\nof my private affairs ? At that time I had been a\nmember of the College for a little over a year, but with\nthe exception of one experiment with the Crewe Circle\nin August, 1920, and a Bessinet seance in July, 1921,\nI had had sittings Mdth no other medium at the College.\nThe following would be a fairly exact summary of the\nfacts which, without elaborate enquiry and special detective\nwork, the College officials could be expected to know :\n1. My name and the address \" Scratton Lodge,\" Brook\nRoad, Prittlewell, Essex.\n2. That I was a recognised teacher in the Faculty of\nScience in the University of London.\n3. That I was very interested in psychic science and\nthat I knew the medium Mrs. A. Brittain and her\nhusband who introcluced me to the College.\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 485\n4. That I had lost a brother in the war. From the\nreport of the Bessinet seance at the end of July,\nwhich I sent to Mrs. M'Kenzie, she might have\nlearnt that my brother's name was Frank, but\nnothing else respecting him.\n5. That in May, 1920, I had pubUshed an article in\nLight on Einstein : the Mathematician as a\nMystic.\nI have no reason to beheve that any of these facts\nwere communicated to Mrs. Cooper, whom I met on\nSeptember 1st as a complete stranger.\nSection 1.\nMy first two sittings with Mrs. Cooper were not very\nevidential, and the supernormal information obtained was\nnot of that clear-cut and conclusive character which is\napparent in the later sittings. I have thought it ad-\nvisable, however, to give a detailed account of Sittings 1\nand 2\u2014first, in order to give some general impression of\nwhat Mrs. Cooper's sittings are hke, and next, as an\nillustration of the way in which a communicator comes\nupon the scene. The notes of these two sittings were\nwritten from memory at the end of the seance before\nleaving the room.\nSitting No. 1.\n2.25 p.m. September 1, 1921.\nPresent : Mrs. Blanche Cooper (medium).\nS. G. SOAL.\nI arrived at the British Psychic College at 2.25 p.m.\nand was met by Mrs. M'Kenzie, who welcomed me and\nf; informed me that I should find Mrs. Cooper waiting in a\nseance room at the top of the building. I found this\nroom, in which a musical box was playing, and knocked\n''\nat the door, which was opened by Mrs. Cooper whom I\ndid not remember having seen before. She said she was\nexpecting a sitter, but did not know whether it would\nbe a lady or a gentleman. Mrs. Cooper shut the door\n\f486 S. G. Soal. [part\nand turned the key in the lock and then pulled a heavy\ncurtain across the door. The window of the room was\nclosely shuttered, so that no light could enter from the\nstreet. Above the fireplace a shaded electric light was\nburning controlled by a switch near the door. A cup-\nboard in the corner of the room contained some old\nclothes. The furniture of the room consisted of three\nplain wooden chairs, a musical box, and a \" cabinet,\"\nabout five feet high, and of rectangular cross-section\n2' by r. The front face of this cabinet was formed of\na pair of wooden folding doors opened so as to leave\ndown the centre a long vertical slit of about 2\" aperture.\nResting on the floor in a corner at the bottom of the\ncabinet was a small metal cross about a foot long, illumi-\nnated with jjliosphorescent paste. The medium informed me\nthat this cross had been used while she was developing\nher mediumship with Mrs. Leonard, hwt was not in use\nat present. The medium arranged the musical box and\nchau's as shown in the plan, and told me I should have\nto keep the musical box wound up with my left hand.\nShe also explained how to start and stop the box.\nStanding immediately in front of the cabinet aperture and\nabout a foot away was a large hght hollow cardboard\ncone called the \" trumpet \" which rested on a broad\nend, diameter eight inches.\nCABINET\nCRO\nMUSICAL BOX\no\nI\n1\nsitter's chair\n'\nThe above plan is not drawn to scale, but is only\n, intended to give a general idea of the arrangement of the\nseance room. The measurements given in the text are\nfairly accurate.\nO\nTR UM PET\n\\\n<\nI\nu\nz>\n5\nUJ\n2\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 487\nThe medium explained that during the sitting this\ntrumpet was levitated in the air and that the \" spirits\n\"\nspoke through it. Having arranged the chairs as shown\nin the plan the medium left her own chair a moment to\nswitch off the hght. In total darkness she groped her\nway back to her chair and asked me to take hold of her\nleft hand with my right. This attitude was maintained\nthroughout the whole sitting. With my left hand I had\nat intervals of about ten minutes to wind up the musical\nbox, which kept repeating the same record.\nAfter we had been sitting in the dark for perhaps three\nminutes Mrs. Cooper asked me if I could see a light.\nI looked round and said I could see nothmg. She rephed,\n\" You will see the light presently.\" At the end of about\nanother two minutes I noticed a very dim amorphous\npatch of light moving slowly about in front of my face.\nIt seemed at a distance of about nine inches away. The\nmusical box played loudly all the time. This hght soon\ngrew fairly bright and took the form of a disc of the\nsize of a crown piece. It was never stiU, but dodged\nabout in the circle space, disappearing and after a minute\nor so reappearing again. When I reached out stealthily\nwith my left hand to touch it the light would always\nrecede in the direction of the cabinet. Mrs. Cooper said\nthat the Hght was produced by a spirit and that I had\nbetter speak to this spirit and ask it its name. I there-\nfore said, \" Are you a relative of mme ?\n\" Thereupon\nthe disc of light made three complete vertical oscillations,\nwhich in the spirituahst code signifies \" Yes.\" Just then\nthe medium said she could see clairvoyantly a letter \" J \"\nupside down, and she asked me if that meant anything\nto me. I said \" No.\" I then addressed the hght again,\nsaying, \" If you are a relative of mine speU out your\nname by moving the light.\" Deliberately and slowly the\npatch of light made six complete vertical oscillations. I\nasked for this to be repeated, and called out A B C D E F\nat each movement of the hght. This I understood to be\nthe first letter of the word intended, i.e. the letter \" F.\"\nI asked the spirit to try to give the next letter, but\nnothing more was attempted. The medium asked if this\n2\n1\n\f488 S. 0. Soal. [part\nletter was correct, but I merely said \" I think perhaps it\nmight be.\" The medium then asked me to turn ofi the\nbox and to join her in singing a few verses of \" Abide\nMdth Me.\" I did my best, but could not remember the\nwords. During the singing no hghts or other phenomena\nwere observed. When the hymn was finished I was asked\nto turn on the music again. Immediately the box had\nstarted to play, I heard, apparently close to my ear, a\nrather deep toned but not very strong voice saying,\n\" I am so glad to see you\u2014so glad you have come\n\u2014\nSam, I want you to know that it is really me.\"\nS. Try to tell me your name.\nVoice. Sam, it's really me, FranJc.\nS. Frank, I wonder if you remember the old house where\nwe used to live.\nF. Yes, yes, dear old place.\nS. I am glad you remember.

Into the field where we used to play.\n[Note.\u2014I had not expected this answer, but it is\nperfectly correct and really apt. I had actually\nexpected him to say \" If you keep on you will come\ninto the grove (a copse where we used to roam).\nThis copse, however, is separated from the bridge\nover the moat by a pasture field some two hundred I\nyards wide which was a favourite playground when\nwe were boys.

Frank, can you remember the day you and I rode to\nChelmsford 1\nF. Yes, yes. Father was very angry.\n[Note.\u2014I did not expect this answer, but it happens\nto be relevant. My brother and I rode to Chelms-\nford only on one occasion in the summer of 1911.\nI was at that time about twenty-one years of age and\nI had cause to remember that on the day following\nthis excursion my father was extremely angry with\nme, although the matter had no connection with our\nvisit to Chelmsford. In my memory I have always\nassociated the ride to Chelmsford with my father's\ndispleasure on the following day.]\nS. Frank, can you remember the village school at all.\nWhat was there near the school ?\nF. Church, church.\n[Note.\u2014^The playground of the village school was\nseparated from the church by a brick wall.

He has been working\nvery hard.\")\nThe light now reappeared floating in the air. The\nmedium called to my brother, \" Try to show yourself\nto us.\" I do not attempt to explain the appearances\nwhich followed, but for the sake of completeness I merely\nrecord them. What seemed to be the rough outline of a\nhuman ear showed on the disc of floating light. This\nappeared and disappeared and then reappeared. There\nfollowed what seemed to be the outline of part of a hand\nshowing four fingers from the knuckle to the finger tips.\nThese \" fingers \" made the motion of opening and closing\nand appeared as dark outlines in the centre of the patch\nof light. No \" thumb \" could be seen. Then something\nwas shown in the light which looked rather like a pair\nof lips. I called out \" Open your mouth,\" and the lips\nmade a definite motion, as of parting, and when I cried\n\" Shut your mouth,\" the lips closed. I tried this several\ntimes. Then something was shown which looked like a\nhooked nose seen in profile. Considerable time was spent\nover these appearances, and when the light had dis-\nappeared the voice of Frank was heard again. It\nappeared excited.\nF. Sam, did you see my ear, my hand, and my mouth ?\nS. Yes, I saw something which looked like a hand and ear\nand mouth, but what was that last thing you were\ntrying to show ?\nF. It was part of my forehead.\n[Note.\u2014Frank's nose was straight, but his forehead\nwas decidedly arched.]\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 491\nA rather deep voice was now heard to say \" Power is\ngoing.\"\nThe medium explained that the voice which had just\nspoken was that of \" Afid \" her Eastern guide.\nThe voice of Frank was heard again.\nF. Sam, I won't say \" Goodbye \" because you will be coming\nagain.\nS. I hope so, goodbye.\nThe medium then said, \" Turn off the box,\" and when\nthis was done we concluded the sitting by singing the last\nverse of \" Abide with Me.\"\nOn consideration I came to the conclusion that while\nthere was no very strong evidence of supernormal infor-\nmation at this sitting, yet the results were sufficiently\ninteresting to warrant a further trial. I therefore arranged\nwith Mrs. Ford, the Assistant Secretary of the Psycliic\nCollege, for another sitting to be held on Thursday, Sep-\ntember 8, at 2.30 p.m.\nSitting No. 2.\nThursday, September 8, 1921, 2.30 p.m,.\nPresent: Mrs. Cooper (medium).\nS. G. SOAL.\nThe conditions were the same as at the first sitting.\nThe patch of light soon made its appearance and I\nobserved in quick succession what seemed to be the dark\noutlines of a hand and an ear. I was also touched\nlightly on the knee by what might have been the trumpet.\nWe sang a few verses of the hymn, and when the box\nwas restarted, the voice which I recognised as the one\nwhich I had heard at the previous sitting commenced to\nspeak.\nF. Sam, I am so glad to see you again. Sam, I was with\nyou yesterday.\nS. Yes, and where did I go yesterday ?\nF. Dogg\u2014Dogger\u2014Dog\u2014Dogget.\n\f492 S. G. Soal. [part\nS. Doggets 1 That's right.\n[Note.\u2014On the previous afternoon Wednesday, Sep-\ntember 7, I paid a visit to a friend who lives close to\nour old home, Little Stambridge Rectory. To reach this\nfriend's house I took the 2 o'clock bus from Southend-on-\nSea to the little market town of Rochford and then\nwalked the remaining distance of two miles across the\nfields of a large farm called \" Doggets Farm.\" This\nfarm, adjoining as it does the rectory fields, was a\nfamiliar haunt of our boyhood days, and on this par-\nticular afternoon I strayed from the footpath and spent\nan hour or so wandering round the plantations, etc., for\nold times sake. I then proceeded to my friend's house.\nMy present address is 5| miles away from Doggets\nFarm and my visits to this place are not more frequent\nthan once in three months. On Sept. 7 I did not\ndecide to pay this visit untU 1 o'clock in the afternoon\nand even the people at home did not know where I was\ngoing when I set out after lunch. Moreover, on reaching\n|\nSouthend-on-Sea I first took a tram towards Thorpe\nBay which lies in quite another direction, as I had\nsome business to do there. I then returned by tram\nand walked down High Street to Victoria Corner, where\nI caught the Rochford bus. Had I been followed by\nstrangers I fancy I should have noticed them if they\nhad tried to follow me over the deserted fields of\nDoggets Farm. Southend-on-Sea is forty mUes from\nLondon, and assuming private detectives to have been\nemployed by the medium or College, the one word\n\" Dogget \" would be a somewhat meagre \" bag \" after\nsuch an exciting chase.\nIt may of course be suggested that what the medium\nactually said w^as \" Dog \" and that an uncertain second\nsyllable was added when she divined that \" Dog \" was\nnot effective. Against this explanation it must be\nurged that \" Dog \" was not a rational answer to the\nquestion I asked. The actual answer I anticipated was\n\" Reeves \" (the name of the people I went to see) or\n\" Rochford \" or \" Stambridge.\" Doggets, however, was an\nexcellent answer. I have given this detailed discussion\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 493\nnot because the incident itself is important, but merely be-\ncause I made such an analysis at the time of the sitting.]\nS. Now Frank, do you remember the hut we had at the top\nof the big field ?\nF. Yes, Sam, 1 remember.\nS. Well, can you tell me what we used to do at the hut ?\nF.

Twelve bricks.\n[Note.\u2014In the autumn of 1910, when I was twenty\nyears of age, my brother Frank and myself with the\nassistance of two other boys named Walter Valentine\nand Percy Paternoster cleared out a hollow in a thick\nhedge on the borders of a copse (called the grove) near\nLittle Stambridge Rectory. With ivy and interlacing\nbranches we formed a roof and in the centre of the\nfloor space we stuik a brick fireplace. During the whole\nof September and part of October we spent many of\nour evenings in this hut in which we had constructed\nrough seats. Within the brick fireplace a large wood\nfire was always burning and round this fire we sat\ntelling stories or reading stories aloud from books until\n\" the evening star washes the dusk with silver,\" and\nthe mists rose in the meadows.\n. It will be seen therefore that the answer \" buUt a fire\n. and sat telling stories \" together with the mention of\nthe bricks ^ was as good an answer as could have been\ndevised in this limited number of words. At the time\nof the sitting I was interested to see how nearly an\nanswer of equal correctness could have been approximated\n^ The actual number of bricks would not exceed four or five.\n\f494 S. G.

I saw the River\nThames for first time.\n[Note.\u2014This visit took place when Frank was about 12\nyears old in the summer of 1912. It would undoubtedly\nhave left a strong impression on his mind. The reference\nto the Thames is interesting. On reaching Liverpool St.\nfrom Rochford we took the Underground to Mark Lane\nwith the intention of visiting the Tower. On leaving\nthe station we walked down to the river and stood for\nsome time watching the shipping and I remember pointing\nout St. Paul's to Frank. Thus the first real glimpse my\nbrother had of London was the view from the River Thames\nand therefore this reference to the Thames seems very apt.]\nS. Then where did we go ?\nF.

One after-\nnoon m August, 1914, my brother and I rode\ntogether on bicycles to Danbury Common, which is\nabout eighteen miles from Southend-on-Sea and is one\nof the highest pomts in Essex.

Some old and some young.\nNothing more was forthcoming about this matter.\n\"\n[Note.\u2014The scene of the above happenings was\nLittle Stambridge Rectory, and the time was the\nsummer of 1909. The old Rectory at which we lived\nfor 12 years is situated two miles from Rochford\n\f500 S. O. Soal. [part\nRailway Station. A lonely place, it has attached to\nit 34 acres of glebe land, and about 40 yards from the\nhouse is a large dilapidated outbuilding, weather\nboarded and thatched, and known to the family as\n\" The Barn.\" The Barn was divided into two\ncompartments of which the smaller was called \" The\nStable.\" Hence M^hen I heard the phrase \" the\nbarn,\" this building was at once pictured on my\nmental retina. I found by enquiries after the sitting\nhad concluded that the word \" Starbobs \" conveyed\nnothing to the mind of the medium, but immediately\nI heard it I recognised at once a local nickname\nused by boys in this particular district for the\nstarlings which in the winter settle in their thousands\nin the copses and groves. In the evening they make\nthe air clamorous with their cries, and the immense\nflocks as they fly to their roosting places pass over-\nhead like a darkening scarf. At the tinae of which\nI write my brother was about ten years of age and\nspent most of his time out of doors clinibmg trees\nafter eggs and young birds. I have made enquiries\nabout the word \" Starbobs \" and find that it is in\nfairly common use among boys in the Rochford\ndistrict. It was certainly used by Frank and his\ncompanions. (See Walter Valentine's statement\n(p. 591) in Appendix.) These boys would organise\nmassacres of the starlings on winter evenmgs. Frank's\nold companions are, however, now widely sejDarated,\nand I would hazard an opinion that \" Starbobs \" is\nabout the last word that a fraudulent medium would\nbe expected to get by enquiries in the district.\nBut to continue with the incident. When I heard\nthe words \" in the barn. Set fire alight. Starbobs\nflew out,\" I conjured up in my mind an imagi-\nnary picture of boys lighting a fire inside the barn\nand the half-burned birds crawling across the floor.\nBut immediately the words, \" a fire with bricks.\nOutside\u2014near the \u2022 \" were said I vaguely recalled\nhaving seen such a fire in bricks. On the following\nSaturday I rode across to Stambridge to interview\n\fxc^a.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 501\nWalter Valentine, who was perhaps the most regular\ncompanion of my brother at this period. I asked\nhim if he could remember any fire that he and\nFrank made outside the barn. He answered at once,\n\" We had a fire ia some bricks just in front of the\nStable.\"\nHe said he thought it would be \" just under the\neaves of the thatch \" and he seemed quite clear\nthat the fire was \" in the summertime, when the\nthatch would be full of nesting starlings.\" He could\nnot actually remember the smoke driving the starlings\nout of the thatch, but thought \" it very likely\nhappened,\" and that \" he was certain the thatch was\nfull of j'oung starlings at that time.\" My sister,\nMiss Lottie Soal, corroborates \" the fire in bricks\noutside the bam,\" and she says that \" Walter and\nFrank had it burning every day for more than a\nweek.\" It is quite certain that I must have seen this\nfire myself and I have an indistinct recollection of\nseeing the brick fireplace in front of the barn. The\nstatement \" you could not come \" would possibly\nmean that I was busy with my studies aU day in the\nhouse and was unable to join the boys in their play.\nAll members of the family corroborate the fact that\nthere were scores of starlings' nests in the thatch of\nthe barn. That picture of the upward-curling smoke\nrising into the thatch and disturbing the birds never\nentered my conscious mind until Valentine showed\nme the position of the fire. I should add that\nValentine, though uneducated, is intelligent and has\na reliable memory. On the same day on which I\nsaw Valentine I also interviewed Percy Paternoster,\n\u2022 \u2022\nwho was mentioned in the account of the seance.\nHe was unable to recollect any fixe outside the barn,\nbut reminded me that at about that period he only\nsaw Frank on ver\\^ rare occasions, and it was not\nimtil 1910 that he became a regular companion.\nSince \" Pat \" lived a mile away from us, I think it\nimprobable that he ever saw this fire. It is practi-\ncally certain that to-day Valentine would not use\n\f502 S. G. Soal. [PAilT\nthe childish word \" Starbobs \" ; he would probably\nsay \" starlings.\" There is, however, no reason to\nsuppose that he has been interviewed by any agent\nof the Psychic College. It would be quite charac-\nteristic for my brother to relate an incident connected\nwith starlings since during his lifetime he was\nintensely interested in birds and their ways, collecting\neggs, bringing up young birds, etc., while I had\nscarcely any interest in them at all. It is just\npossible that the incident is a fabrication of my\nown unconscious mind founded on the memory of\nthe fire which I had seen. That is, the incident may\nbe a mixture of truth and fabrication.]\nNo. 3 Incident. \" Father M'Kenna.\"\nSitting No. 4.\nTuesday, September 13, 1921, 2.30 p.m.\nPresent : Mrs. Cooper (medium).\nS.

This copse was\nchristened by the family \" The grove,\" and the\nwooden gate the \" The grove gate.\" At the top of\nthis tall tree Frank and another boy, Walter Valentine,\nin the summer of 1914 constructed a kind of nest or\neyrie in which they would sit for hours. My mother\n, remembers this hut very well. She was in fear that\nthe boys would break their necks. The reference to\nthe woodcock is very remarkable. The bole of this\nelm which Frank always called the \" big tree \" was\nsomewhat hoUow and rotten at the base and had\nprojecting from it a curious piece of timber which bore\na rough semblance to a large bird or cock. Seen\nfrom a distance it certainly did resemble a cock and\nfor several years Charley\u2014my eldest brother\u2014always\nspoke of it as the \"wooden cock.\" This piece of\nrotten wood disappeared somewhere about the year\n1907 or 1908. Frank must have heard us talk about\nit often and have seen it himself when a small boy.\nBut perhaps the most interestmg feature is Frank's\nstatement that \" you could see the River Crouch\"\nfrom the top of the big tree. I had never myself\nclimbed to the nest or eyrie and at the time of the\nsitting I had no idea that the Crouch would be\nvisible from such a comparatively low altitude.\nWhen I asked the question at the seance I expected\nhim to reply, \" you can see Prittlewell Church,\" or\n\" you look down on the grove.\" On a Saturday,\nin October, 1921, to satisfy my curiosity on this point\nI actually climbed to the topmost branches of this\nelm\u2014no easy feat owing to the slenderness of the\nhigher boughs. To my surprise I could plainly see\nthe silver streak of the Crouch over the top of a\ngentle rise to the north. It is, of course, just pos-\nsible that the boys might have mentioned seemg the\nCrouch and that I had heard them at the time and\nforgotten it. The incident, however, is certainly\ninteresting in its unexpectedness.]\n[Note added April 23, 1925.]\nYesterday (April 22) I saw Walter Valentine and\n\f508 8. G. Socd. [PABT\nmade a little experiment. I had not previously\nmentioned to him anything about the \" Big Tree\nIncident \" and \" the view of the Crouch \" as I felt\nat the time that the matter could be best tested by\nchmbing the tree myself. Yesterday, however, it\noccurred to me to put to Walter Valentine without\nany warning the same question that I had previously\nasked Frank at the seance. I asked suddenly\n\" Do you remember the hut at the top of the big\ntree ? \" He answered \" Yes, very well.\" I then\nasked \" What could you see from the top ?\n\" With-\nout the sKghtest hesitation Valentine rephed, \" The\nwhite sails of the yachts on the River Crouch.\"\nThe purporting communicator and the living person\ntherefore in this case agree that it was the view of\nthe Crouch that impressed them most from \" The\nBig Tree.\" For Valentine's corroboration see\nAppendix [A].\nNo. 7 Incident. \" The Conan Doyle Story.\"\nSitting No. 14.\nThursday, November 17, 1921, 3.30 p.m. Present : Mrs. Cooper.\nS.

Frank and I\neagerly looked forward to the successive instalments\nof this fascinating story, and when the magazine\narrived we would take it into the field where, sitting\non the grass, I would read it aloud to the others.\nIt was, in fact, the only magazine serial that I ever\ndid read aloud to the boys. \" Birds with teeth\n\"\nrefers obviously to the pterodactyl with which\nProfessor Challenger and his companions had such\nperilous encounters ;\n\" big animals \" would refer to\nthe dinosaurs and other extinct monsters.

To everybody's surprise they found one\nafternoon a huge eel at the end of the Ime. The\nsame week they cauglit another as large as the first.\nThe family had not expected that eels of such size\nlived in the moat. My mother remembers cooking\nthe eels which no one except Frank really liked, as\nthey had a muddy flavour. The getting of the\nword \" moat \" is in itself very interesting. What we\ncalled the \" moat \" was in reality a very wide ditch\nwhich surrounded the Rectory on three sides. Water-\nrats abounded in its banks and it is remembered\nby the whole famUy that on one occasion Frank\nmade a bow and arrow and succeeded in shooting\none or two of these rats. The mention of the birds\nwhich \" dashed down the water \" vividly recalls the\nmoor hens or water hens which made their homes\nthere. Very frequently if one walked unperceived\nto the edge of the moat one of these birds would\nscuttle away down the water in a great flurry.

Soal.\nScRATTON Lodge,\nBrook Road,\nPrittlewell, Essex,\nOctober 24, 1921.\nOn Thursday evening of October 13, my brother, Mr.\nS. G. Soal, showed me the records of a sitting which he\n. had had that day with Mrs. Blanche Cooper at the British\nPsychic CoUege. These notes purported to be a communi-\ncation from my deceased brother Frank and indicated the\npossibility of the finding of a medal under the earthen\nfloor of a hut made by us some years ago m a double\nhedge near Little Stambridge Rectory. No description\nwas given of this medal except the statements that it was\nheavy, and had a piece of cham attached. The position\nof the buried object was indicated fairly exactly by the\nphrase, \"near the brick fireplace.\" I did not remember\nmy brother possessmg any such objects, but he may have\ndone. I remember that the hut was used in the year\n1910, and understood that it had fallen to decay since.\nOn Saturday, October 15, my brother suggested that\nwe should ride over to Stambridge and have a look at\nthe place. Neither of us had any real hopes of finding\n\f14 S. G. Soal. [PAET\nanything and I consented to accompany my brother merely\nfor the sake of the ride. We set out at about 2 o'clock\nin the afternoon and reached the Rectory fields sometime\nafter three. We found the hut had fallen in and its\nfloor was overgrown with brambles and undergrowth of\nvarious kinds. I stayed near the hut whUe my brother\nwalked over to the Rectory to borrow a spade and pick\nfrom Mr. Williams, the present occupier. It was Mrs.\nWilliams who lent him the spade and pick. On his return\nwe cleared away the brambles and roots and soon found\nthe remains of the old brick fireplace. We delved around\nthis with the pick as the ground was iron hard. Presently\nwe were able to remove some clods with the spade, but\nat first found nothmg. On prising out a large clod on\nthe left-hand side of the fireplace, I detected something\nmetallic sticking out of the underside of the piece of earth.\nThe object was firmly bedded in and from the state of\nthe ground it could not have been put there at all recently,\ni.e. not during the present hard condition of the earth. It\nwas found at about the depth of three quarters of a spade\ndepth. When extracted it proved to be a disc of lead\nof about two inches in diameter and nearly a quarter of\nan inch in thickness. At about half an inch from the\ncircumference a hole had been bored through the disc,\nprobably for the purpose of inserting a chain or string.\nNo chain was however found. The edge of the disc\nlooked as if it had been cut by a chisel from a sheet of\nlead. There was no inscription or any sign of machine\nwork on the disc, and I cannot conceive for what purpose\nit could have been used unless as a lad's plaything to be\nwhirled about at the end of a chain or piece of string.\nThe hut was buUt on virgin soU, and therefore if any\nobject was found buried it was most probably buried by\none of the boys who inhabited the hut. Neither my\nbrother nor myself can recall ever having seen the object\nbefore. The other two boys, Percy Paternoster and Walter\nValentine, who used to sit in the hut, can remember nothing\nabout it. There seems, therefore, at least a possibility\nthat it was put there by Frank as stated in the seance.\nThe surface of the lead showed evidence of severe oxidiza-\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 515\ntion, but I could see no signs of iron rust near the hole\nwhere a chain might once have been and have rusted away.\nThe disc could not properly be described as a medal, but\nmight perhaps be called a medallion.\nC. W. SOAL.\nA consideration of the statement of my brother, Mx.\nC. W. Seal, argues at least a fair possibility that my\nbrother Frank buried something in the hut, and that this\ninterment was known only to himself. It is important\nto note that the object was found in the position indicated\nat the seance. In addition, we have the important state-\nment that it was \" heavy,\" while the object found was\nmade of lead. Although no chain was found yet the hole\nin the disc seems to suggest the possibility of there having\nbeen a chain at some time. I have since made enquiries\nof several boys who knew Frank at school, but not one of\nthem can remember having given him the medallion, or\never having seen it before. This lack of corroborative\nevidence that the medal was ever in Frank's possession\nis perhaps the chief flaw in the case.\nAttempts to Obtain Information About Matters\nUnknown to the Sitter.\nTowards the end of September I interviewed Walter\nValentine, one of the boys who had known my brother\nintimately during the Rectory period, and asked him to\nthink over a few striking incidents connected with my\nbrother's life at Stambridge, of which I should be entirely\nignorant. These incidents I asked him to put in the\nform of questions so framed that I could not myself\neasily guess the answer, but which nevertheless admitted\nof fairly definite rephes. Valentine, who thoroughly under-\nstood the object of the experiment, said he thought it\nwould be difficult to frame such questions for the reason\nthat I myseK knew most of what Frank had done at\nStambridge. He promised, however, to think the matter\nover in his spare time, and when I visited him in about\na week's time he had made three or four such questions.\n\f516 S. G. Soal. [part\nI regret to say that I did not ask him to enclose them\nin an envelope to be opened only at the seance, but\ncopied them at his dictation into my pocket book. There\nwas therefore the possibihty of rapport being estabUshed\nin the interval preceding the seance between Valentine's\nmind and my own. Very little is, I think, known about\nthe conditions under which spontaneous telepathy operates\nfrom A to B via a third person C. One or two cases,\nhowever, have I believe been recorded which seem to\nindicate that this kind of transference may sometimes\noccur. The questions propounded by Valentine read as\nfollows :\n1. What did we have to eat on the day when you and\nme and Pat walked from Fambridge Ferry to\nCreeksea Ferry ?\n2. When you and I went to bathe at the Mill one day\nwhat happened to our boots ?\n3. One day when you and me and Pat were sitting in\nthe hut I did something that made Pat very angry,\nwhat was it ?\nI put the first and last of these questions at Sitting\nNo. 7 on October 5, after the incident of the \" Christmas\nPresent.\" I said to Frank :\nS. Frank, Walter has made some test questions of which\nI don't know the answer. I want you to do your best\nto get the answer through.\nF. All right Sam, fire ahead.\nS. The first question is this, \" When you and Walter and\nPat walked from Fambridge Ferry to Creeksea Ferry,\nwhat did you have to eat on that day ?\n\" Take your\ntime to answer. Do you know the time I am talking\nabout ?\nF. Remember it very well, Sam. Were tired to death.\nS. Now do you remember what you had to eat ?\nF. Sam\u2014Samfer\u2014samfer\u2014samphire.\nS.

Try samphire and swedes.\n(Pause.)\nS. Now, Frank, I am going to put you another question.\nS.

What did Walter do to make Pat angry ?\nF. It's very difficult Sam, I can't get it.\n(Pause.)\nF. It might be when Pat was sitting over the fire and\n\u2014\n(Pause.)\nS. Yes, Pat was sitting over the fire and what then ?\nF. Walter knocked the tin of water on the fire.\nF. Pat was mad.\nS. Is that the answer ?\nF. That may be what he means.\nOn the evening of Friday, October 28, 1921, I rode over\nto Great Stambridge to interview Valentine with regard\nto the tests. To avoid the risk of his memory being\ninfluenced by my answers I asked him to go into his\ncottage and write the correct answers on separate pieces\nof paper, while I wrote the answers obtained at the\nsitting on other pieces of paper. I was first to show my\nanswers to Valentine, and if they were reasonably correct\nhe was to show me his corresponding answers. If, how-\never, my answer was hopelessly wrong or inadequate, he\nwas to keep his own answer so as not to spoil the test\nfor a second sitting. I first showed Valentine the paper\non which I had written \" samphire and swedes.\" Valen-\ntine produced his piece of paper on which was written,\n\\ve ate swedes.\" I asked him about the samphire, but\n\f518 S. G. Soal. [part\nhe said he was quite sure that none of them ate samphire\non that day.\nI then showed Valentine the second answer which read\n\" Walter ran away\u2014Pat was sitting over the fire and\nWalter knocked the tin of water on the fire. Pat was\nmad.\"\nWalter Valentine said that the phrase, \" Walter ran\naway,\" was quite relevant, but that the rest of the answer\nabout the tin of water was altogether wrong. He did not\nshow me his paper in this case, but suggested that I\nshould try again. I did try at a subsequent sitting, but\nno intelligent answer was obtained.\n^\n[Note.\u2014It will be seen that a success was scored with\nthe word \" swedes.\" Had I not heard Frank say, \" in\na field,\" my conscious mind I feel sure would not have\nsuggested \" turnips,\" in fact, what I was thinking of was\n\" winkles,\" or some sort of shell fish, since I knew this\nwalk was on the sea wall. The answer \" samphire\n\"\nalthough definitely wrong is very interesting. From the\nway in which the question was put Mrs. Cooper or her\nsubconscious mind could scarcely have guessed that the\nwalk was by the side of a tidal river on whose saltings\nthe glasswort (locally called samphire) blooms in profusion\nduring the month of September. I, however, was quite\nfamiliar with the plant from which a sort of pickle can\nbe made and the stems of which even in the raw state\nare not unpalatable. I had sometimes during my rambles\non the Essex marshes nibbled at the green stems ;\nthey\nwere salty but not disagreeable. Samphire, however, does\nnot suggest edibihty to the majority of people, and I very\nmuch doubt if IMrs. Cooper even knew that it grew in\nEssex.]\nThe question as to whether the boys could have eaten\nglasswort on this journey, I have settled definitely in the\nnegative. The excursion took place on a Good Friday\n(this is confirmed by several people, including my mother),\nand at this time of year the glasswort has not begun to\nthrust its shoots through the mud ; at an3rrate they are\n1 For the real answer to Valentine's question and additional notes see\nAppendix [A].\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 519\njust beginning to appear and could not be eaten. The\ngetting of the word \" samphire \" suggests therefore either\ntransference from my own mind or the emergence of an\nassociated memory in the mind of the communicator.\nThe answer given to the second question even although\nit may be wrong as a reply to the question certainly\nsuggests supernormal knowledge\u2014possibly of a telepathic\nnature. Mrs. Cooper could not possibly know by any normal\nmeans that a tin of water was always kept in the hut\nfor the express purpose of extinguishing the fire when we\nleft at night. The incident described was just the sort\nof prank that a mischievous boy like Walter would be\nlikely to play on another boy seated over the fire.\nHaving emptied the tin he Avould then naturally run away\nto escape the wrath of his victim. The incident may\nactually have happened, or, on the other hand, it may have\nbeen a pure mvention of my own subconscious mind.\nIt is not the sort of thing that Mrs. Cooper herself could\nhave invented ; it reveals too intimate a knowledge of\nconditions at the hut.\nFor Valentine's corroboration of these tests see Appen-\ndix A.\nThe third test about the boots when put at a subse-\nquent sitting ehcited no intelligent answer. It will be\nseen therefore that one definite success was scored in the\nseries of tests.\nUnverified Incidents which show Supernormal\nKnowledge.\nIt will be observed that almost all the preceding inci-\ndents refer to a particular period of my brother's life,\nnamely the years when we hved at Little Stambridge\nRectory, and during which I was most closely associated\nwith him. From the year 1915 onwards I saw much less\nof him for I was away on my Army service. After the\nthirteenth sitting I encouraged him to speak of things\nconnected with this later period of his Me, as I thought\nthat such incidents would afford a greater chance for\nthe exclusion of direct telepathy from myself. From time\n21.\n\f520 S. G. Soal. [part\nto time Frank attempted to speak of matters comiected\nwith his Mfe in the Army, but unfortunately the incidents\nhe selected were such as were almost impossible to verify.\nBut though it seemed absolutely impossible to prove his\nstatements they were from a psychological standpoint very\ninteresting as the setting of the incidents invariably\nshowed supernormal knowledge. The statements made\nwere true as far as the sitter knew anything about them,\nbut the main incidents although plausible could not be\nchecked.\nA typical example occurs in Sitting No. 16, held on\nThursday, December 1. At this sitting Mr. A. L. Gregson\nwas present.\n(Franlt spoke first and related the following story :)\nF. Sam, I'm trying to give you something about when I was\nin the Army.\nS.

At the end of\nthe sittmg when John Ferguson had gone I questioned\nFrank again about it, but could get no additional\ninformation.)\nNow the medium could hardly have known that my\nbrother had belonged to a Bicycle Section whose Head-\nquarters were at Sevenoaks in Kent. The fact that\nFrank's Battalion rode on manoeuvres through Kent to\nthe Sussex Coast was known to me since it was mentioned\nin one of his letters to my mother. These manoeuvres\nappear to have lasted a week or two, and my brother in\nhis letter mentions such things as \" passing through\nGroombridge,\" \" fighting all the way,\" carrying \" pack\n90 lbs.\" with bicycle 60 lbs. up a three miles' hill on\nthe first day's journey from Sevenoaks. As the letter\nis dated September 8, 1917, the time certainly corres-\nponds with \" apple time.\" There is, however, in this letter\nno mention of his being sent on scouting operations or\nof any old woman who gave him apples. Nor is there\nany definite mention of a sight of the sea in this letter\nalthough I have some hazy recollection that when my\nbrother visited me in Maida Vale hospital one day at the\n\f522 S. O. Soal. [part\nend of September 1917, he mentioned catching a glimpse\nof the sea from the Downs. I have also a distinct recol-\nlection that he told me on that occasion that they had\nridden 80 miles and that he mentioned Lewes. It is one\nof those tantalising problems which we shall probably\nnever solve. Have we here a superstructure of fabrication\nreared upon fragments of knowledge obtained supernormally\nfrom the mind of the sitter 1 Or was my brother detail-\ning an incident which actually occurred ? The next\nsection of our paper will perhaps throw some light on this\nquestion of fabrication. A similar series of unverifiable\nincidents were given by my brother in connection with his\nelectrical career, but it is perhaps scarcely necessary to\ndescribe them. The best that can be said for them is\nthat they appear plausible and show a knowledge of\nmatters which the medium could not possibly have\nobtained in any fraudulent way.\nOther cases similar to this in connection with electricity\nwere obtained, but the one described above should suffice.\nI have been asked the question, \"Did your brother\never profess to remember an incident which turned out\nto be definitely false\u2014not merely unverifiable 1\n\" I would\nreply that in the case of incidents spontaneously volun-\nteered by Frank I can find no intelligible story which\nproved to be definitely false. There is, it is true, one\ncase in which Frank talked about \" a letter \" \" sent\nto the old Jiouse \" \" after you left\n\"\u2014\" you did not get\nit.\" But the wording is so very vague that some doubt\nmight be felt about the meaning. Though I tried to clear\nthe matter up by questions the story still remained inco-\nherent. If, as I suppose, it refers to a letter being\naddressed to us at Little Stambridge Rectory after we\nhad moved to Prittlewell, I think it highly improbable\nthat we should not have received it since the P.O. would\ncertainly forward it.\nHe also stated in a sitting that \" a great friend of his,\nM , had put a green wTeath on his grave.\" It seems\nhighly improbable that he ever had such a friend who\nwould put a wreath on his grave.

The\nanswer I hoped for was \"In a hollow willow tree where\nwe found his hoard one day.\" Frank, however, merely\nmuttered, \" In Drawer\u2014Drawer,\" and then lapsed into\nsilence when told that the answer was wrong. It is safe\nto say that no spontaneous incident of the same importance\nas say \" The Starbobs \" incident was ever given which\nproved to be false.\nOn three occasions Frank gave book-tests, but only\none of these appeared to be a success. The successful\none (if not due to chance coincidence) is rather remarkable\nand is recorded in Psychic Science [April 1923].\nFrank gave no descriptions of his life in the other\nworld\u2014perhaps for the reason that I never encouraged\nthis kind of message.' On one occasion he uttered a few\nsentences about \" the beautiful summerland,\" but I must\nconfess I thought at the time that both the voice and\nthe views sounded very like Mrs. Cooper.

G. Soal. [part\nable to watch the mental interplay which goes on between\nthe minds of the sitter and the medium. I do not mean\nto suggest that there is anything transferred from the mind\nof the sitter to the mind of the medium, but merely state\nthat there is a causal nexus between the working of the\ntwo minds ; of the fundamental nature of the process\nI know nothing. I use the term \" transference \" merely\non account of its convenience and not as implying any\ntheory of what is observed to happen. The case of John\nFerguson seems, however, to suggest some of the con-\nditions to be observed when carrying out similar experi-\nments. The stories about the communicator which the\nsitter suggests to his subconscious mind should in the first\ninstance be plausible and not such as would conflict with\nthe statements given by the communicator at the previous\nsittmgs. The arguments on which the sitter bases his\nconjectures of what is to transpire may be quite unsound\nfrom a logical point of view ; what seems important is\nthat they should be psychologically suggestive. In other\nwords the sitter must be able to convince the irrational\nside of his mind that the arguments he employs for\narriving at his conclusions are plausible, and that his\nabsurd conjectures have at least a sporting chance of\ncoming true. It is necessary, in fact, that the ideas\nwhich he wishes to transfer to the medium should in the\nfirst place have become active in his own subconsciousness,\nfor there is some evidence to show that it is those ideas\nwhich are coloured by an emotional tone which have the\nbest chance of becoming externalised by automatism. In\nmy own case I actually came to half beheve the things\nI had supposed about John Ferguson, and had a sort of\ndesperate hope that they might turn out to be facts after\nall. At the same time the logical, reasoning part of my\nmind told me that my arguments were childish and\nabsurd. I was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt\nthat John Ferguson was a pure fiction\u2014a personality\nbuilt around certain scenes and events comiected with my\nown thoughts and environments.\nThe case of John Ferguson, which extended over ten\nsittings, shows throughout a curious consistency, not\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 525\nuncommon in such fictitious cases, which was kept up till\nthe fiction was finally exploded at the end.

At this stage I formed\nin my mind the first of a series of purely fanciful\nconjectures about the communicator John Ferguson.\nI amused myself with the follomng absurd arguments.\n1. J. F. said he died in 1912 at the age of 33. His\nbrother Jim would therefore be about 13 in the year\n1902, since J. F. had said that Jim was ten years\nyounger than himself. In 1902 the James Ferguson\nI knew would be about 13.\n2. J. F. said his brother was a bit of a scholar. This\nwould probably mean that Jim attended the High\nSchool while John had had no such advantages.\nQuite possibly, therefore, Jim went in for Army\n- \u2022 teaching but finding something more lucrative gave\nit up for engineering. Of course, needless to say,\n\u2022 - I knew these arguments to be absurd, but I hoped\nvaguely that \" there might be something in it.\"\nI was, however, very surprised to see the effect of\nthese imaginings upon the next sitting, No. 15.}\nSitting No. 15.\nThursday, November 24, 3.30 p.m. Present : Mrs. Cooper.\nS.

My object was not to settle\nthe question of John Ferguson's identity but to glean\na few facts about the locality and watch what effect it\nwould have on the next sitting. I alighted at the railway\nstation, walked down the High Street, and presently met\nsome Grammar School boys in their red caps. Entering\ninto conversation with the boys I asked if there was a\nstreet in Brentwood called \" Wescot Road.\" \" Oh yes,\nsir,\" one answered, \" there is a Warescott Road. It is\na good walk from here and lies off the Ongar Road.\"\n\" How do you spell it ? \" I asked. \"It is speUed\nWarescott, but we say it like Waiscoat or Wescut.\"\n\" I will give you a riddle,\" said I, \"it is to find a street\nin Brentwood consisting only of large houses with red\ngates which has an avenue of trees and whose name\n\f534 S. G. Soal. [part\nbegins with H.\" The boys thought a while and at last\none of then answered, \"It could only be Highland Avenue.\"\nAnd checking off the points one by one they all presently\nagreed that Highland Avenue was the only street that\nwould fit the description. \" And where does Highland\nAvenue lay,\" I asked. \"It is off the Ongar Road a\ngood mile from here, and Warescott Road is not far from\nHighland Avenue.\" Bidding the boys adieu, I set out\nfor Highland Avenue, which I reached after a quarter of\nan hour's hard walking. It is a comparatively new road\nrunning at right angles to the Ongar Road and contains\nperhaps not more than a dozen large houses each standing\nmajestically in its own grounds. The gates were all\nnicely painted of a dark red colour, and on each side of\nthe street was a row of young trees. It certainly seemed\nto answer John Ferguson's description. I did not, how-\never, enquire whether anyone lived there of the name of\nFerguson, but walked a few hundred yards down the hill\nto view Warescott Road. I found a short street of about\nthirty-two houses, obviously the homes of the artisan\nclasses of the town. The houses were not detached, but\nbuilt into two long blocks on each side of the street.\n\" What a contrast,\" thought I, \" this street presents in\ncomparison with the spacious opulence of Highland Avenue.\"\nWhat conceivable connection could there be between\nfamilies living in such different environments ?

He had\nnever heard of the name of Ferguson in connection with\nanyone in Highland Avenue. With the exception of one\nhouse called \" Paglesham,\" all the houses had retained\ntheir original owners since 1913. A certain Captain Shoe-\nsmith,^ who had been living in \" Paglesham \" in the year\n1913, had quite recently left the district and the house\nwas now empty. Mr. Symonds did not inform me where\n. Captain Shoesmith had gone. On this point I am positive\nI\nsince I made notes in my pocket-book at the time. While\nf I was conversing with Mr. Symonds, there came into the\nPost Office a postman whose round had included Ware-\n^\nscott Road for a great many years. This man told me\nthat no people of the name of Lloyd lived in Warescott\nRoad at the present time. Some seventeen years ago,\nhowever, he remembered a \" very dirty old woman,\"\nJ\ncalled Mrs. Lloyd, who had lived in one of the houses,\nbut this woman had left some sixteen years ago.

As the communi-\ncator had described \" Ethel \" as a \" young person,\" who\npresumedly lived in Warescott Road somewhere about\nthe year 1912, this clue seemed scarcely worth following\nup. I next visited Warescott Road and learned from a\nresident that no \" young person called Ethel \" was living\nthere at present.\nI next visited Mr. Cottee of 11 Rose Valley, the\nRegistrar of Births and Deaths, and was informed by him\nthat no directory of Brentwood had been published since\n1913, owmg to the War. On consulting a 1913 Directory,\nI verified that no Ferguson was living in Highland Avenue\nin 1913, and no Lloyd in Warescott Road at that time.\nCaptain Shoesmith, R.N.R., was, however, hvhig at\n\" Paglesham,\" as stated by ]\\Ir. Symonds. Reference to\nold directories showed that no Ferguson had lived in\nBrentwood for many years before 1912. On leaving\nMr. Cottee, I walked over to Highland Avenue and noted\nthat \" Paglesham \" was the third house on the left from\nthe Ongar Road. I then returned home.\n[Note.\u2014Between the date of the above visit and the\nnext sitting, which was held two days later, I invented\nmore theories around the enigmatical personality of John\nFerguson. I thought of Captain Shoesmith, R.N.R., who\nhad just left Highland Avenue for a destination unknown.\nThe tenor of my argument ran as foUows :\n1. Caj)taui Shoesmith was a naval man.\n2. The Navy is in close co-operation with the Coast\nDefence Artillery. What more natural then than the idea\nthat John Ferguson's father should have met Captain\nShoesmith at Shoeburjmess. The fathers became friends\nand consequently the sons of Ferguson became friends\nwith the sons of Shoesmith. Hence we have an ex-\nplanation of John Ferguson's request for us to \" enquire\nat Highlands about Jim.\" These conjectures the communi-\ncator most obliguigly confirmed at the next sitting.]\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 539\nSitting No. 18.\nDecember 14, 3.30 p.m. Present : Mrs. Cooper.\nS.

He must have a rest after giving these splendid tests.\n(There is a pause during which lights appear.)\n[Note.-\u2014This complicated series of allusions merits\na special study. In the first place the phrase \"where\ncowslips grow in cockle beds \" is a most ingenious\nmethod of introducing the name \" Paglesham,\" which\nit will be remembered was the name of Captain\nShoesmith's residence at Brentwood. Now Paglesham\n^ It has been necessary to alter the name given at the sitting to correspond\nwith the pseudonym given above on p. 537.\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 541\nis the name of a small hamlet on the Essex coast\nsituated about four miles from Little Stambridge\nRectory. Frank and I visited this place several\ntimes. It is noted for its cockle and oyster beds.\nMoreover the word '\nPaglesham \" (Ham of the\nPaigles) is Anglo-Saxon for \" cowslip meadow.''' ^ This\nderivation was, of course, known to both Frank and\nmyself, but I could hardly imagine that Mrs. Cooper\ncould have loiown even the place, let alone the\nderivation. The next phrase \" cockles but no cow-\nslips \" clearly refers to our own visits to Paglesham,\non which occasions we could always discover the\ncockles but never the cowslips. The succeeding\nstatement \" not even cocldes, Sam, only empty\nshells,\" is once more an allusion to the visits which\nmy brother and I made to Paglesham. Walking\nalong the sea wall by the side of the creeks, we often\ncame across shallow rectangular tanks of concrete full\nof sea water, and the bottoms of these tanks were\ninches deep in cockle shells. But all the shells were\nempty and never a cockle could be seen. The\nreference to \"a riddle of a tree \" and \" mon \" also\nclearly shows supernormal knowledge. On our walks\nto Paglesham we passed a house which had on its\nlawn a well grown \" Monkey Puzzle,\" and I dis-\ntinctly recall that we always stopped to admire this\ntree,2 which was the only specimen in the neighbour-\nhood visible from the high road.

[part\n[Note.\u2014On December 26, 1921, I addressed a\nletter of enquiry to Captain Shoesmith, R.N.R.,\n\" Paglesham,\" Highland Avenue, Brentwood, Essex,\nand marked the envelope \"To be forwarded.\" In\nthis letter I mentioned all the facts of the case,\ndescribing the object of my experiments and including\na brief list of the statements of the communicator.\nTo this I added a request that Captain Shoesmith\n\u2022 \u2022\nwould be so kind as to throw any light possible on\nthe subject, with the assurance that the matter would\nbe treated as confidential.

Further, \" he had no recollections of\npictures or cats \" in cormection with the residence\n\" Paglesham,\" which he did not occupy prior to\n1913. All the statements of John Ferguson with\nregard to Highland Avenue are therefore definitely |\nproved to be false. There is, however, one curious\npoint to be noticed. Captain Shoesmith 's letter bore\nas its address the single word \" Pl3rmouth,\" and is\ndated January 7, 1922. In Sittmg No. 18 it will\nbe remembered that in reply to a question of the\nsitter, John Ferguson stated that \" Shoeshuae \" had\ngone to the seaside and mentioned \" Plym \" as the\nname of the place.

After an interval\na new communicator, James Miles, appears, whose\ncase is considered separately in Section 3.)\n[Note.\u2014At this stage the statements of John\nFerguson were virtually disproved. It only remained\nto disprove his assertions about his burial in the year\n1912 at the South Necropolis, Glasgow. On January 5\nI addressed a letter to the Keeper of the Cemetery,\nasking him to make a list for me of all the Fergusons,\nmale and female, who had been interred in the South\nNecropolis since the year 1890. An examination of\nthis list show conclusively that no John and Amy\nFerguson were buried in the same grave, and further\nthat no John Ferguson was buried on March 3, 1912.\nA communication from James Anderson, Keeper of the\nSouth Necropolis, Glasgow, is printed in Appendix C.\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 549\nOn examining the map after Sitting 20, I found\nthat the streets mentioned\u2014namely, George Street,\nCharing Cross, and India Street,\u2014were all quite close\ntogether. India Street was in very small type\nindeed. It would seem as though a little area of\nthis map had been visualised by myself unconsciously\nand transferred to the medium.]\nIt would appear from the study of \" John Ferguson\n\"\nthat the case for spontaneous telepathy between medium\nand sitter is far stronger than the average psychic re-\nsearcher usually admits. Indeed, it would seem to be so\nextensive that in the present state of our knowledge we\nare not justified in putting any limits to it. A large\nnumber of the incidents described in Section 1 purporting\nto come from the mind of my deceased brother may be\nso many examples of spontaneous telepathy from myself.\nAnd it would even appear that a purely fictitious communi-\ncator like John Ferguson can sometimes give supernormal\ninformation about facts unknown to the sitter, e.g. his\nknowledge of Captaia Shoesmith's removal to Plymouth.\nThe hypothesis of conscious fraud on the part of the\nmedium in this case may obviously be lightly dismissed. No\nintelligent person who cares to study the evidence could\nentertain it for a moment. If there was fraud we should\nclearly have to assume that the sitter was also a party\nto it. In the end, therefore, the case rests largely on\nmy o-\\vn honesty, and there I must leave it.\nSection 3.\nThe Case of James Miles.\nAlthough the evidence is mainly of a negative character,\nI have thought it worth while for purposes of comparison\nto give some account of this case.\nThe case of \" James MUes \" would appear to be one of\ncryptomnesia rather than of conscious fraud. The cases\ndiscussed elsewhere in our paper do not support the theory\nof conscious fraud on the part of the medium, and there\nseems jio reason to assume it here. To suppose that\n\f550 S. G. Soal. [part\nMrs. Cooper had read the account of James Miles' death in\nthe Daily Express and unconsciously dramatised it is, on\nthe whole, the most rational explanation. There is in\nthe later sittings a certain amount of evidence for tele-\npathy from the sitter's mind but practically no evidence\nfor any independent exercise of the medium's supernormal\nfaculty on the life of James Miles.\nIt may be suggested that the reason why real super-\nnormal information was not forthcoming in this case is\npossibly to be found in the fact that no link of any kind\nexisted between James Miles and the sitter. Exactly\nwhat constitutes a link is at present a very difficult\nmatter to determine. Osty seems to look upon a link\nas consisting of some object, living or inanimate, which has\nhad physical associations with the subject upon whom the\npsychic desires to exercise her powers. But, however\nthis may be, it is certain that the sitter neither possessed\nany object connected with James Miles nor was acquainted\nwith any of his friends or relatives. Nor had he ever\nbeen to Bath, the place where James Miles lived, or pre-\nvious to the sittings to the best of his knowledge known\nany people who hailed from there.\nAbstract of first two \" Miles \" Sittings.\nIn lieu of quoting the full records which have been\nfiled for purposes of reference, it will be sufficient to give\na summary of the various statements made by the com-\nmunicator.\nSitting No. 21.\nMonday, January 9, 1922, 3.40 p.m. Present : Mrs. Cooper.\nS.

Asked what it was he was \" trying\nto catch,\" he said it was \"nothing alive,\" but something\n\" I had given me.\"\nHe then attempted to give the name of a street where\nhe hved as LOCK\u2014^foUowed by another syllable having\nthe PR or BR sound and a D at the end. The last\nhalf of the word \" had to do with water.\" Asked if the\nday was warm and sunny when he fell into the water,\nhe replied, \" No, it was very cold.\" In reply to the ques-\ntion \" Did no one try to save you ? he gave the answer,\n\" It was too deep.\"\nAs a result of the information obtained at the two pre-\nvious sittings, I consulted the English directory on Janu-\nary 17 and discovered that UPPER WESTON and\nLOWER WESTON are parts of BATH, and that further\n\f552 S. G. Soal. [part\nthere is a LOCKSBROOK ROAD in LOWER WESTON.\nThe statement that the second part of the name \" had\nto do with water \" made it practically certain that I\nwas on the right track. I accordingly selected the\nname of a responsible resident, \"J. T. Fryer, Esq.,\nBuilder's Merchant,\" living in LOCKSBROOK ROAD,\nand wrote to him asking if he would kindly confirm the\nfacts given at the sittings. I addressed a similar letter\nto the \" Registrar of Births and Deaths,\" Bath.\nOn January 19 I received a reply from the Rev. A. T.\nFryer, 63 Newbridge Road, Bath.

He was a\nvery strong healthy lad, but could not swim. He was at\nhome about 1.30, mid-day, when three boys came to\ninform him of the tragedy. They said that \" Jimmy was\nin the water drowned.\" He asked where it was and at\nonce hastened to the spot, between the Midland Railway\nbridge and the Weston toll bridge, but he could see\nnothing of him in the water. There was no one there\nat the time. Witness went to the Twerton Police Station,\nwhere he was informed that a boat was being procured\nto drag the river. He himself returned to the river\n. bank.

E. Winckworth, Superintendent\nRegistrar of 12 Charlotte Street, Bath, a cutting from the\nBath Weekly Chronicle, published before the date of the\ninquest on \" James Miles.\"\n\f554 S. G. Soal. [part\nFrom this account of the tragedy I shall quote only\nsuch items as are important in view of developments at\nsubsequent sittings. Under a sub-heading \" A FATAL\nSLIP \" we read :\nMiles, it appears, noticed a toy balloon floating down\nthe river near the bank. He at once exclaimed, \" That's\nmy balloon,\" and endeavoured to secure it. His two\ncompanions appear to have taken little interest in his\nfind, and were possibly engrossed in a game of their own.\nAt all events. Miles appears to have attempted to secure\nthe balloon without the assistance of his companions.\nHe scrambled down the bank, which is rather steep at\nthis point, and presumably encountered some insecure\nfoothold. At all events, his horror-stricken companions\ntold a Bath Chronicle representative that they watched\nhim \" roll \" into the water. . . . No cry was heard and\nthe tragedy seems to have ended before help was forth-\ncoming. .\nFurther on in the report occurs the statement :\n\" The\nboy, James Miles, was a member of '\nUncle Fred's\n'\nLeague, which is conducted in cormection with the Bath\nWeekly Chronicle, and was one of the recipients of a\n'\nJoy Parcel '\nin the recent Christmas distribution. His\nmother is in somewhat poor health, and recently under-\nwent an operation in hospital. Thursday's tragic hap-\npening has naturally distressed her extremely.\"\nI had arranged to have my next sitting on Monday,\nJanuary 23, but unfortunately an attack of influenza\nobliged me to postpone it until Monday, January 30.\nIn the meantime on Friday, January 27, I visited the\noffices of various London newspapers and copied from the\nfiles the accounts of the fatality published on December\n30, 1921, and December 31. I found that accounts of\nthe tragedy had appeared in three London Newspapers\n\u2014\nthe Daily Mail, the Daily Chronicle, and the Daily Express.\nOf these accounts only that given in the Daily Express\ntallied exactly with the statements made at the two pre-\nvious sittings. This report read as follows :\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 555\n''DAILY EXPRESS\" DECEMBER 30, 1921.\nBoy's Life for a toy\nDrowned in rescuing his Balloon\nA toy balloon received as a Christmas present caused\nthe death of a thirteen year old school boy named James\nMiles at Bath yesterday. The balloon was blown into\nthe Avon and Miles and two other boys tried to rescue\nit. MUes slipped while scrambling down a steep bank\nand fell into deep water. Meanwhile the balloon had\ndrifted out of sight.\nMiles was one of a family of eleven.\nHis father is a painter at Clarence Place, Locksbrook\nRoad, Weston.\nThe Daily Chronicle mentioned all the facts given by\nthe communicator with the exception of the address\n\" Clarence Place.\" The Daily Mail gave much less infor-\nmation than did \" James Miles \" at the sittings.\nI will now give a brief summary of certain additional\nstatements made by James Miles at sittings No. 23 and 24.\nSitting No. 23.\nMonday, January 30, 1922, 3.40 p.m. Present : Mrs. Cooper.\nS. G. SOAL.\nAt this sitting the voices were rather indistinct. Nada\nappeared and gave the word LOCKSBROOK correctly.\nShe then mentioned \" a pink thing \" which she thought \" was\non Jimmy's bed.\" A little later \" James \" himself pur-\nported to speak, and I asked him to give me details about\nhis home and family. He mentioned a baby \" named\nGeorge that died when it was a year old.\" \" Bobby,\"\n\"Willie\" and \"J \" were mentioned as the names of\nhis brothers. Thei'e was a reference to \" Little Sid \" (or\npossibly \" Little Sis \")\u2014\" a sweet little thing,\" and also a\nmention of an \" Uncle Frank \" (possibly an attempt to\ngive the \" Uncle Fred \" of the Bath Chronicle's report\nwhich I had read). A date June 20, was given as being\nthat of someone's birthday, possibly \" Willie's birthday.\"\n\f556 S. 0. Soal. [part\nA little later came a statement which seemed to refer to\nsome insurance money. \" It wasn't much money. Father\ntook it\u2014paid to him\u2014a big building\n\u2014\" (sounded like\n\" \u00a32 \" ).\nSittiyig No. 24:.\nMonday, February 6, 1922, 3.30 p.m. Present : Mrs. Coopek.\nS. G. Soal.\n\"James\" appeared again, but said \"he was all mixed\nup, and didn't know what he was saying.\" He repeated\nthe names \" Bobbie \" and \" Willie \" of the previous\nsitting, and gave an additional name, \" Mary.\" He also\nmentioned a boy named \" Seymour,\" aged 11. He went\non to speak about \" Two gates not far from where he\nlived,\" ...\" Two gates we used to go through . . . one\nbroken ... I scratched my name on it.\" \" Scratched\n'\nJ.M.' and '\nOily.' \" Towards the end of the sitting Nada\nmade the statement, \" The mother is very ill. That's a\ngood test.\"\n[Note.\u2014I had read that the mother was very ill in the\nBath Weekly Chronicle, but was not thinking of the fact\nat the moment. S. G. S.]\nThere was also a reference to \"A man putting out a\nbig stick \" (possibly some confused attempt to bring in\n\" the drag poles \" of which I had read in the inquest\nreport. S. G. S.).\nOn February 7 I sent a list of the statements made at\nSittings 23 and 24 to the Rev. A. T. Fryer for investiga-\ntion, and on February 10 received a report from him.\nMr. Fryer stated that he had had an interview with Mr.\nMiles at his home at 5 Clarence Place on Wednesday\nevening, February 8. It appears from Mr. Fryer's long\nand detailed report that practically all the information\ngiven at these last two sittings was incorrect. The names\n\"Bobbie,\" \"Willie,\" and \"Sid,\" for instance, were not\nthe names of the lad's brothers as stated. The \" impor-\ntant date (June 20) \" seemed to have no connection with\nthe family. The bed coverlet was not pink, and although\nthere- was \" a broken gate \" in the neighbourhood of the\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 557\nboy's home it appeared that \" James \" had not carved\nhis initials on it. Mr. Miles had received some insurance\nmoney in respect to the dead boy, but states that he did\nnot thmk \" James \" knew he was msured. Certainly\nthe amount was more than \" \u00a32.\" The statement con-\ncerning the mother's illness was correct, but the sitter\nhad read it previously in the Bath Chronicle.\nAt Sitting No. 25 held on February 13, 1922, when\nthere was present, besides myself, Mr. Harold Rankui, of\n\" Broomhills,\" Rochford, Essex, the name \" Helen,\" or\n\" NelHe,\" was given as the name of the mother of James\nIMiles. This proved to be incorrect. \" Jimmy \" also\nmentioned that his father's name was \" Charles,\" a fact\nwhich the sitter had previously read in the \" Bath\n\"\nnewspapers. \" James Miles \" did not appear at any\nsubsequent sittuigs.\nIt should be added that ui a letter dated 16.11.1922,\nMr. Fryer states that \" James, so his brother says, was\nnot given to cutting his name on any gate.\" \"As to\nthe mention of the lad named '\nSeymour,' the children\nat home have made inquiries amongst the school children\nand the lads of the Boys' Brigade, but there is no\n'\nSeymour '\namongst them.\"\nObservations and Deductions.\nA careful inspection of the London press reports and\ncomparison with the records of Sittings 21 and 22 shows\nthat all the verified facts given at the first two sittuigs\nwere published in at least one London newspaper, the\nDaily Express. Further we see that there is no correct\nstatement obtained at these two sittings that could not\nhave been deduced from the account in the Daily Express\nof December 30. An interesting feature of this case is\nthe remarkable way in which every scrap of information\ngiven in the London press is utihsed to support the\nimpersonation of the deceased lad. Thus, when I ask\n\" James \" the question, \" Did no one try to save you ?\n\"\nhe replies, \" It was too deep.\"\nIn the Daily Express we read \" He fell uito deep water.\"\n\f558 *S'. G. Soal. [part\nAgain \"James\" says, \"I've such a lot of brothers and\nsisters,\" while the Daily Express states, \" Miles was one\nof a family of 11.\"\nIt is when we come to compare the wealth of accurate\ndetail given at the first two sittings with the press account\nand then contrast this with the poverty and inaccuracy\nof the later \" communications \" that no doubt is left in\nour minds that the newspapers were the source of the\ninformation. \" Jimmy,\" who was able to \" get through \"\nsuch complicated names as \" LOCKSBROOK \" and\n\" CLARENCE PLACE \" fails to give correctly the name\nof a single brother or sister or school mate. As the\n\" spirit \" of \" James Miles \" he falls obviously to the\nground.\nBut in what sense is the newspaper the source of the\ninformation ? I have satisfied myself that during the\ndays December 30 and 31 I saw no newspaper except\nthe Daily Chronicle. I was staying in the country at the\ntime, and spent the days in long walks. During those\ntwo days the Daily Chronicle was the only paper available\nto me, but as the report of the fatality was printed on\nthe first page I must almost certainly have read it. This\npaper, however, could hardly have been the source of the\ncommunications since the important name \" Clarence\nPlace \" is omitted from the account.\nThere is good reason for believing that the London\nDaily Express and not the \" Bath \" or West Country\nnewspapers was the true source. In the first place, while\nthe correct information given at Sittings 21 and 22 just\ncovers the Daily Express account it does not nearly\nexhaust the store contained in the Bath Herald or the\nBath Chronicle. But there is another more conclusive\nargument. In Sitting No. 22 \" James \" makes concerning\nthe toy balloon the statement \" It was something I had\ngiven me.\" Now all the London Papers state definitely\nthat the balloon was a Christmas present to the boy\nJames. In the \" Bath \" papers, on the contrary, there is\nnothing to lead one to believe that this balloon belonged\nto James Miles. In fact, the general impression made by\nreading the reports is to the effect that the boy found\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Coojjer. 559\nthe balloon in the water. Thus Leonard Pitt in his\nevidence at the inquest says :\n\" Jimmy saw what\nappeared to be a toy balloon in the water near the\nbank.\" It is true that in the Bath C'hro7iicle we\nread that the boy was the recipient of a \" Joy Parcel,\"\nbut we are not told that the balloon was part of the\ncontents of this parcel.\nOne other interesting point calls for note. The \" Direct\nVoice \" gave correctly (a) the fact that the mother was\nvery ill and (6) the father's name \" Charles.\" Neither\nof these facts were given in the London newspapers, but\nthey were not given at the sittings until the sitter had\nread them in the \" Bath \" papers. We have here some\nevidence for \" transference \" from the unconscious mind\nof the sitter to the automatism of the medium. It is\nthe kind of transference which we have studied in greater\ndetail in the case of \" John Ferguson.\" By the study of\nsuch cases as these we learn that the mere dramatisation\nof a communicator by tricks of intonation, peculiar and\nconsistent style of address and the like, affords no guaran-\ntee that we are in touch with discarnate agency. The\ntendency to impersonate seems to be a native tendency\nof the unconscious mind. It is by the quality of the\ninformation they communicate and by that alone that\nwe must test the claims of so-called \" spirits.\" Judged\nby this test the \" spirit \" of James Miles certainly\nfalls to the ground. Nor need it be imagined that we\nare putting forward such cases as this as an argument\nagainst the possibility that so7ne of the mental phenomena\nexhibited by mediums are the result of discarnate agency.\nIt is almost certain that the mental phenomena of auto-\nmatism have their origin in many sources. Sometimes\nthe source (as in this case) is the acquired knowledge of\nthe psychic, sometimes it ii^ the acquired knowledge of\nthe sitter transferred to the medium's automatism. The\nimportant duty of the investigator is to track each piece\nof information to its most probable source. In this spirit\nwe hope to continue our observations.\nTo sum up then, we are bound to assume that the\npresent case is one of cryptomnesia on the part of the\n\f560 S. G. Soal. [part\nmedium. The medium states tiiat she does not read\nthe Daily Express, and in view of this statement there is\njust the bare possibiHty that the medium clairvoyantly read\nthe contents of the newspaj)er paragraph or that she\nobtained the information from the unconscious minds of\nthe thousands who must have read and assimilated the\naccounts of the tragedy of James Miles. It is \" in the\nair,\" so to speak. But if such clairvoyance there be, it\nscarcely seems to extend in this case beyond the limits of\na London newspaper. -\n'\nIt is curious that Mr. Fryer in the course of his investi-\ngations should have come across a gate inscribed with\ninitials. But this is probably a coincidence. Indeed it\nwould have applied equally well, in fact far better if it\nhad been given as a piece of information to support the\nimpersonation of my brother Frank. Frank actually did\ncarve his name on the gates near home, whereas \" James \"\nwe are told \" was not in the habit of scratching his name\non gates.\" Again, there is the question of the insurance\nmoney paid to Mr. Miles, and not mentioned in any news-\npaper. That is curious, but it may be nothing more\nthan a lucky guess by the unconscious mind of the\nmedium. There is a, lack of definite and clear evidence\nfor any independent clairvoyance in this case and we\ncannot, therefore, assume it.\nIn conclusion, our thanks are due to the Rev. A. T.\nFryer for his co-operation \u2022\nin investigating the facts given\nat the sittings ; but for his help we might never have\nreached our present conclusions.\n'~\nSection 4.\nThe Case of Vordon Davis.\nA \" Communication \" from a Living Person.\nIn discussing this remarkable case it would be perhaps\nentirely illogical, although practically convenient to des-\ncribe the case as one of \" communication \" by a living person.\nThere is not a great deal of real evidence to justify us in\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 561\nsaying that the living Giordoii Davis took any active part\nin the affair. We Imow tliat his conscioxis mind was\nbusy interviewing clients on both occasions on which he\nwas supposed to communicate. All that we are entitled\nto say is that a communication was received concerning\nGordon Davis ; that is to say, certain facts were com-\nmunicated about his life history, past and future. Some\nof these facts were given in the form of verbal statements\ndescribing incidents which had happened or which were\nto happen ; other facts such as his vocal characteristics\nwere expressed in a purely physical way.\nFor mediums to obtain knowledge supernormally about\na living person is not an infrequent occurrence, but cases\nin which the hving person appears to \" control \" the\npsychic and is dramatised and made to speak in the first\nperson are, I believe, extremely rare, although not un-\nknown.\nIn the case under consideration the supernormal know-\nledge shown is of a high order. Not only is there pene-\ntration into the past of the \" communicator,\" but there\nare considerable indications that the future was also\nanticipated.\nThere is further (I think) some grounds for the assump-\ntion that this prevision was of the purely psychic kind\nrather than of the kind that is built up upon inferences\ndrawn from present data. Granting this assumption, the\ncase has special interest in relation to those theories in\nwhich the material universe is regarded as a four-\ndimensional complex, with time as the fourth dimension.\nLooked at from this point of view, human beings have\nan extension in time as well as in the other three dimen-\nsions. They exist in their totality independently of the\nparticular moment at which we choose to view them.\nThe personahty of Gordon Davis was arrested, as it were,\nat a particular point of the time stream\n\u2014\ni.e. a special\nthree-dimensional section was taken of his four-dimensional\ncomplex. He was dramatised in 1922 to appear as he\nwould be in his new environment of 1923.\nOne very interesting point arises. This dramatised\npersonality, so accurate in its other statements, apparently\n\f562 S. G. Soal. [part\nbelieves itself to be a deceased person. We might, of\ncourse, assume that this idea was suggested to it by the\nspiritistic mind of the medium, who in turn obtained false\ninformation from the mind of the sitter. But is this the\ntrue explanation ?\nIt is to be noted that Gordon Davis does not give any\ndetails about the circumstances of his death. It is true\nthat \" Frank \" expresses some \" belief \" that G. D. was\nkilled in the war, but it must be remembered that Frank\ncould not tell anything else about him, and the possibility\nis that he was merely \" guessing.\"\nRecord of Gordon Davis Sittings.\nSitiing No. 20.\nWednesday, Jam(ary 4:, 1922, 11.10 a.tn.

At school I knew of him rather than\nknew him, for he was in a higher form than myseK. I\nhave a distinct recollection that he was a very intelligent\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 567\nboy, disposed to ask disconcerting questions during our\nlessons in science and geography, which subjects I took\nwith him in the same class. He was, even at school,\nsomething of a dandy, and somewhat more refined in his\nspeech than the rest of us. Of his people I knew nothing,\nexcept that they lived at Rochford. while I lived '2\\ miles\naway. I feel fairly certain that I never knew in what\npart of Rochford, Gordon Davis lived. Doubtless we must\nhave spoken to each other at school, but I cannot recall\na single conversation. Prolmbly I really saw very little\nof him, owing to the fact tliat I was a younger boy than\nhimself, and in a lower class. I fancy he left school\nsomewhere about the year 1901, and for many years after\nthat I lost siglit of him. I may have had some vague\nidea that he liad started business in Southend, and I may\npossibly have seen him walking in the street, but I cannot\nremember ever speaking to him until one day in May,\n1916, I met him on the platform of Shenfield Station,\nwhere we were both waiting for the London train. We\nwere at that time both cadets, he in the infantry and I\nin the artillery, and we -^ere botli returning from week-end\nleave. I was. I remember, going to Bexhill, but I do\nnot remember his destination. As boys who had been to\nschool together we recognised each other, but he seemed\nto know me better than I knew him, for he it was who\nspoke first. We entered the same compartment and\ntravelled together as far as Liverpool Street, which is\nabout half an hour's journey from Shenfield. During the\nride I am quite certain -ne did not discuss family matters\nat all ; he did not even tell me whether he was married or\nnot. We spent all the time comparing the routine of artillery\nwith that of infantry cadets, and I remember very vividly\nhow lie mentioned to me that lie had been detailed to\ngive a lecture to the other cadets on the duties, of the guard.'\"\nGordon Davis seemed full of the Army, and I noticed\nespecially that he had cultivated a rather nice accent.\nWe parted at Liverpool Street, and I heard no more of\nhim for a long time. I knew, of course, that as an\nInfantry Officer he would be sent to the Front very soon.\nIn August of the same year I was myself sent to France,\n2o\n\f568 S. G. Soal [part\nand did not return nntil I was A\\ounded in June, 1917.\nspent a year in the Isle of\nWight as Instructor of Cadets, was sent to Oxford as\nchief instructor in mathematics at the Army School of\nEducation, and was finally demobilised in the spring of\n1919. It would be some time in the autumn of 1920, that\nI received a false impression that Gordon Davis had been\nkilled in the War. On my way to visit a friend at\nRochford one day, I met a man with Avhom I was very\nslightly acquainted, and with this man I walked for a\nmile, our paths being in the same direction. He began\nto speak of the men belonging to Rochford who had died\nin the War, and I feel almost certain that he told me ^\n\" Gordon Davis has gone west too.\"\" This news made a\nconsiderable impression on me at the time, and I men-\ntioned at home that Gordon Davis had been killed. My\nremarks did not excite much comment, because no one\nat home knew Gordon Davis, and I did not personally\nmake any enquiries, because our acquaintance had only\nbeen of the slightest. I often, however, thought of him\nand of our last meeting in the train, and how tragically\nthings had ended for him. It never, indeed, occurred to\nme to doubt that he had been killed. I took it for\ngranted that the news I had received was correct. Had\nI made the least enqukies I should certainly have had\nmy impression corrected quickly enough, for he had\nstarted business in Southend as an Estate Agent, and was\nbecoming very well known in the district. I live, how-\never, in Prittlewell and do not very frequently visit either\nSouthend or Rochford, and in this fact is to be found an\nexplanation of my continued belief that Gordon Davis\nwas dead. When I received my first communication\nfrom Gordon Davis on January 4. 1922. I was considerably\nimpressed, particularly by the lifelike reproduction of\nmannerisms of speech, tone of voice, and accent, but I did\nnot attach any very great weight to the subject matter\nof the communication which did not (at the time) appear\nII have heard independentl,y from botli Mr. and Mrs. Davis that after\nthe armistice there was a widespread rumour in tlie district that Mr. Davis\nh:iil lieen killed.\n\fxcvi.] Communications Tlnough Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 569\nto iiie to go much beyond what I had known of Gordon\nDavis. I was certainly impressed by the giving of the\nword \" Malty because I knew that there is a large\nbuilding at Rochford called \" The Malting,'\" now used as\na storehouse for flour, etc. At this particular period of\nmy psychic researches I had just conehided the long study\nof telepathy in the case of John Ferguson, and I formed\nthe idea that the case of Gordon Davis could probably be\nexplained in a similar manner, i.e. by transference of\nfragments of knowledge from the sitter's mind to that of\nthe medium. I paid still less attention to the description\nof the house by Nada at the sitting of January 9. I\nthought it was all the purest fiction. Very fortunately\nat Ijoth sittings I had taken verbatim notes of every\ndetail, and my brother, Mr. C. W. Soal, corroborates\nreadino- these notes in the Christmas holidays of 1921.\nwhen he was home on vacation. It was in rebruar}^\n1925. that I first learned indirectly that Gordon Davis\nwas alive and practising as an Estate Agent in Southend-\non-8ea. I heard also that he had only been livhig in\nSouthend-on-8ea for a year or two. and I therefore con-\njectured that the verification of the details given by Nada\nabout his house would be an extremely difficult matter. I\nlearned, moreover, about the end of February that Gordon\nDavis was living at No. 54 Eastern Esplanade, and I was at\nonce struck by the fact that the two \" E's \" mentioned\nby Nada as giving the address would be applicable to this\nstreet. Pressure of work prevented me from paying a visit\nto Gordon Davis until the evening of April 8, 1925.\nRecord of My Visit to Gordox Dams.\nI arrived at Mi'. Davis' house No. 54 Eastern Esplanade,\nat 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, April 8. I noticed at once\nthat to reach the front door one had to ascend a flight\nof six steps, and that the lowest of these steps was an\nextremely thin slab of stone in comparison with the other\nfive steps. I noticed also that the house was part of a\nsingle long block of houses facing the sea. There were\nno houses on the other side of the street. I noticed also\n\f570 S. G. Soal. [part\nbefore ringing the bell, a kind of curious tunnel which\nleads from the street into the back gardens of the block.\nThere were several such tunnels\u2014one between each two\ndoors. The door was opened by Mrs. Davis, who ad-\nmitted me into the drawing room on the ground floor, and\nasked me to wait for a few moments, while she informed\nher husl)and of my visit. At the time of my arrival the\ndrawing room was in darkness but there was a light in\nthe dining room which is in the basement. When the\nelectric light was switched on in the drawing room. I\nimmediately noticed that there were many pictures hung\non the walls, and that all these pictures contained either\nmountains or seascapes. I also noticed several fairly\nlarge vases, and two objects on one of the walls Avhich\nI should have unhesitatingly described as \" saucers.\"\nThere was also a very large mirror above the mantelpiece\nwhich arrested my attention. In a short time Mr.\nGordon Davis entered the room, and after we had ex-\nchanged greetings I began to broach to him the object\nof my visit. Before, however, I had showed him any of\nmy papers I noticed that he had used the expression\n\" Old man \" twice, and \" Old chap \" once, which affords\nan independent verification of (25). When I explained\nsomewhat hesitatingly that I had come to talk to him\nabout psychic matters, he remarked, \" Old man, I've tried\nall my life to steer clear of these things and I will tell\nyou why. A man like myself whose mind is always\nrunning on his business has no time for this sort of thing.\nIt's all very well for people who have leisure. I've\nnoticed another thing. I've noticed that people who go\nin for this kind of thing are nearly always dannied\nunlucky. I suppose I'm a bit superstitious myself ; would\nnever walk under a ladder or use the third match.\" I\nthen explained briefly about my direct voice sittings and\ncommunicated to him the somewhat astounding news that\nhe himself had been a communicator at one of these\nsittings. I then handed him a typewritten record of the\nsitting on January 4. He was very much amused, and\nkept exclaiming, \"Just the very words I should use.\"\nWhen he came to the word \"^Malt \" he said, \"Why,\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 571\nthat is the name of the house where I lived at Rochford,\ntwenty-five years ago.\" It was always called \" The Mal-\nting.'\" if anyone wanted specially to refer to it. When\nlie came to the j^hrase \" harpoons\u2014was for brighter\ngeography,\" he cried \" Well, that's damned fmmy.\" I\nnext handed him the record ^ of tlie sitting on January 9\n(also typewritten).\nAVhen Mr. Davis had finished reading the records, we\nset about the business of discussing them point by point,\nand AA'hen we had carefully examined the room and the\nroom downstairs, and also the outside of the house and\nits surroundings, we repaired to Mr. Davis' office on the\nMidland Railway approach, where Mr. Davis keeps his\npersonal diaries. It was obviously important for us to\nfind out, if possible, what Mi-. Davis was doing at the\nexact hours when his spMt was supposed to be communi-\ncating. With regard to this matter we were extremely\nfortunate. For several years Mr. Davis has kept a detailed\nrecord of his daily doings, the precise hours at which he\ngives interviews to clients, etc. We were, therefore, able\nto learn exactly what Mr. Davis was doing at the time of\nboth sittings. I questioned Mr. Davis (who was keenly\ninterested) on every aspect of the case that occurred to\nme. taking notes of everything he said. I next propose\nto exhibit in a tabular form Mr. Davis' statements together\nwith any corresponding data obtained at the sittings in\n1922.

Soal.\nScRATTON Lodge,\nBrook Road,\nPrittlewell,\nEssex.\nApril 9, 1925.\nI followed the records of my brother's sittings with\nMrs. Cooper during the years 1921-22 with great interest,\nand remember reading week by week the instalments of\nthe cases of Ferguson and James Miles, copies of which\nmy brother sent me to Cambridge. The case of Gordon\nDavis I remember reading in the vacation of Christmas,\n1921. This I read from the green books in which my\nbrother wrote his original records. I have this morning\ncompared his typescript with the records in those\nbooks and find them accurate and in order. I can\nrecall most of the details of the description of Gordon\nDavis' house and liave a distinct recollection that some-\ntime during the summer of 1920 my brother told me that\nhe had heard that Gordon Davis was dead. I never knew\nGordon Davis personally. I have also, as far as possible,\ncompared the typescript of Section 1 with the records in\nthe green books and find them accurate.\nC. W. Soal.\nAnalysis or the Evidence.\nA study of the foregoing records would appear to\nestablish with reasonable certainty the following facts :\n1. The communicator was able to give accurately, facts\nabout the past life of Gordon Davis. Some of these facts\nwere known to the sitter ; others were not, e.g. the name\nof the old house in Rochford.\n2. The communicator reproduced the characteristic\nmannerisms, accent, etc., of the Hving person. These we\nmust consider to be, in a certain sense, also facts about\nthe life of Gordon Davis, even although they are expressed\nin a dramatic form. We must beware of supposing that\nsuch facts are essentially different from the other class of\n2p2\n\f586 S. G. Soal [part\nfacts represented hy incidents in the life of the deceased\nperson.\n3. Tlie communicator gave accurate descriptions of the\nenvironment and interior of the house whicli he and his\nwife and child were to occupy a _year later. The question\narises, however, coidd the living Gorrlon Davis on the\nday when he first visited the house have formed in his\nmind, consciously or subconsciously, an idea of what its\ninterior arrangement was to be like 1 The evidence seems\nto show that he could not by any normal process of\nthought. Though the kingfisher was in his possession he\ncoukl scarcely have known that it was to stand on the\npiano. He informs me that his wife did not visit the\nhouse with him on January 6, and that when she did visit\nthe house some months later she was for some time unde-\ncided whether the living room should be in the basement\nor on the ground floor. It is, therefore, liighly improbable\nthat CTOi'don Davis or his wife could have come to any\ndecision by January 0. \\9'22, conscioiis or unconscious,\nthat the two brass candlesticks in their jDossession were to\nstand \" on a shelf downstairs \" (.34). Mr. Davis told me\nfurther that when he visited the house on January 6,\n1922, he was not thinking at all about how it would look\nwhen his furniture was transferred into it. He says his\nchief preoccupation at the time was in planning how to\nget it clean. At that time the house was not empty, but\noccupied by tenants and in a dirty condition. Moreover,\nthe pictures on the walls were as different as possible\nfrom the present selection and consisted mainly of cheap\nprints. Mr. Davis also said that at the time of taking\nover the house he had no particular predilection for \" sea-\nscapes \" but that he had always liked water-colours. He\nacquired the sea-scapes fortuitously and not through any\nspecial love for this kind of picture. These facts are\nimportant in helping us to a conclusion as to whether or\nnot there was true pre-vision in this case or not. If I\nmake the statement that there will be an eclipse of the\nsun on January 14, 1926, that is in a certain sense an act\nof pre-vision. In the last analysis this kind of scientific\npre-vision is not more explicable than the kind of pre-\n\fxcvi.] Coniiainiicaiiom TkroiKjIi Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 587\nvision which one meets ^\\ith in psychic research. There is,\nhowever, this essential difference. When I predict an\nechpse of the sun. 1 base my prediction on hypotheses\nwhich have been tested and found to work again and\nagain. I have, therefore, a certain degree of intellectual\ncontrol over the phenomena which I predict, although\nI have no practical control. In the case when a\nl)sychic predicts the death of a certain person, he does\nnot consciously follow any well-tested rationale and he\ndoes not know how his unconscious mind arrives at its\nresults. It does not follow, however, that the unconscious\nmind does not follo\\\\' a definite rationale in arriving at\nits conclusions. If \\\\e kne^^\u2022 the nature of tlie hypotheses\nupon which the subconscious mind works, it might perhaps\nbe possible to predict events in the lives of human\nbeings with as much certainty as the astronomer shows\nwhen he predicts the return of Halley's comet. The two\nkinds of pre-vision may, therefore, not really differ in the\nlast analysis. What we have to make sure of in this case,\nhowever, is whether the kind of pre-vision employed is\nof the scientific or of the psychic variety. We know that\njust two days before the house was described by the\npsychic the living Gordon Davis was occupying his\nconscious mind with it. He had visited it and gained\nknowledge of its environment and interior. Certain\narticles, such as the brass candlesticks and the picture of\nthe mountain road, the saucers and the vases, were already\nin his possession. Certain tastes, such as a taste for\nwater-colours, were in his possession. The bird also\nl)elonged to him. But could he have arrived at the\nknowledge that the bird would most probably stand on\nthe piano and that no single portrait picture would be\nhanging on his walls in the next few years i Could he\nhave known that the two brass candlesticks were to stand\nin the downstairs room and not in the upstairs room ? If\nthese questions are answered in the affirmative then we\nhave a case of ordinary or scientific pre-vision : if in the\nnegative, it is a case of pure psychic pre-vision.\nIn a discussion after the present paper was read before\nthe Society it was suggested by Dr. V. J. Woolley that\n\f588 S. G. Soal [PABT\nthe case of \" Gordon Davis \" might be somewhat simpHfied\nby assuming that the pre-vising agenl ims the sitter and\nnol the mind of Gordon Davis. Dr. WooUey suggests, in\nfact, that telepathy from Gordon Davis did not play any\nreal part in the affair, biit that when the future house\nwas described the sitter was unconsciously pre-vising, not\nan event in the life of Gordon Davis, but an event in his\nown life, i.e. his visit to the house on April 8. 1925.\nThe sitter, therefore, saw the objects at the sitting as they\nappeared on the day of his future visit. This theory\nAvould clearly require us to assume that all the information\ngiven at the sittings about the past of Gordon Davis was\nthe sitter's own normally acquired knowledge and not\nderived by any telepathy from Gordon Davis. Incidents\nlike the address at the \" Malting \" we should have to\nassiune were scraps of information once normally acquired\nby the sitter and now forgotten. Further, it would be\nnecessary to suppose that the fairly close coincidence in\ntime between the date of the sittings and the date,\nJanuary 6, on which Mr. Davis first visited the house was\ndue purely to chance. Again, the mention of \" Playle\n\"\nat the sitting and Mr. Davis' visit to his friend Playle\ntwo days later must also be attributed to chance. It\nwill be remembered that on my visit to the house on\nApril 8 I saw Mrs. Davis but not the little boy, who\nwas in bed at the time. It would therefore be necessary\nto suppose that the pre-vision of the tilings in the house\nnot only extended to the things which the sitter saw but\nalso to the substance of his conversation with Mr. Davis.\nAgain, the expression \"kiddie\" applied to the little boy\n\u2014\nan expression which was mvariably used by Mr. and Mrs.\nDavis\u2014must have been either the result of a lucky guess\nor of a pre-vision of the future conversation of Gordon\nDavis with the sitter. Mr. Davis himself has expressed\nthe opinion that the rej^roduction of mannerisms, mental\nattitudes, etc., are far too accurate to be attributed to\nthe single half-hour's conversation which the sitter had\nwith him in the train.\nIt may be added that if we care to push such theories\nof pre-vision to their ultimate conclusion they may be\n\fxcvi.] Communications Through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. 589\ncalled upon to \" explain \" almost any psychic fact.\nAlmost any piece of information given by a medium and\nafterwards verified by the sitter might be thought of as\na pre-vision by the sitter of the moment in his life when\nhe comes to verify the fact ! I do not, however, suppose\nthat Dr. Woolley or any other student would be prepared\nto go as far as that. But if pre-vision is to be accepted\nas a fact in .jjsychic research, it does not seem possible in\nthe present stage of our knowledge to set any very precise\nlimits to its scope.\n\f590 \/S'.
