Alexander Calder, Walter H. Coffin,\nEdmund Gurney, Chas. C. Massey, Edward R. Pease, and Frank\nPodmore. Mr. Calder was eleeted to take the chair.\nThe minutes of the previous Meeting were read, and with a slight\nalteration signed as correct.\nOn the proposition of the Chairman, seconded by Mr. Gurney,\nProfessor H. Sidgwick was elected a Vice-President, and a Member' of\nthe Council, in accordance with Rule 18.\nFive new Members and eight new Associates were elected, whose\nnames and addresses appear on another page.\nA letter was read from Major G. Rowan Hamilton, a Member of\nthe Society, expressing his wish to resign, mainly on account of being\nso much abroad.\nIt was agreed that Mrs. Wingfield\u00b7should, at her request, be elected\nas a Member instead of as an Associate.\nInformation was received of the death of Mrs. Jennings, wh()\njoined the Society last year as a \"Library Associate.\"\nPresents to the library were on the table from-Mr. E. Heron-Allen,\nMr. H. A. Kersey, Mr. John Moule, Members of the Society; from the\nPhasmatological Society of Oxford; ar.d from Dr. Monckton, of\nMaidstone. The books are specially acknowledged in the Supplementary\nCatalogue on another page. The thanks of the Council were directed to\nbe given to the donors. ,\nMr. Gurney reported th'lt he and Professor Ba.rrett had been per-\nmitted by Mr. Husk to examine the iron ring on his wrist. They\nfound that five fingers could be inserted between the ring and the\nwrist. Their opinion ,vasi that, though the ring in its present shape\nDigitized by Google\n\f290 Journal q.f Society for P8ychical Resem\u00b7ch. [Marcb,l885.\ncould certainly not be drawn off without considerable violence, if at all,\nyet, if it were hammered or forced into a more convenient form, the\ninsertion or withdrawal of the hand might be possible. The question\non which Professor Barrett and Mr.' Gurney had to report was\nrestricted to this one point-how far the mere fact that the ring, when\nthey saw it, was round the wrist, could be regarded as a conclusive\ntest of its having got there by some unknown agency. They considered\n.that in itself the test was not conclusive.\nSubject to a suggested alteration of one phrase, a new edition of\nthe\" Objects\" was agreed to, embodying a statement of the new\narrangements with regard to the research work of the Society.\nThe Finance Committee presented a report, accompanied by an\nestimate of receipts and expenditure to the end of the year. The\nfollowing is a summary of its principal points:-\nThe Committee reported that they had met and had examined the\nfinancial affairs of the Society. After making what they considered a\nreasonable estimate of the number of llew Members and Associates who\nmight be expected to join the Society during the remaining months of\n1885, the unappropriated income of the Society, including the balance\nnow in hand, might be set down at \u00a3868, without calculating on the\nreceipt of any important donations.\nKeeping efficiency in view, they submitted a proposed distribution\nof this sum, which included the items of rent, general meetings, salary,\nand necessary current expenses on the scale of last year, the issue of\ntwo more Parts of Proceedings, and the monthly journal, leaving only a\ncomparatively small amount available for experimental work. This\nresult, however, is attained only by the inclusion of an offer on the\npart of Professor Sidgwick to defray in the first instance, certain\nitems of expenditure connected with the work of the Literary Com-\nmittee, to be repaid by the Society in the event of there being a\nsufficient surplus at the end of the year.\nThe report of the Committee also states: \"It will be observed\nthat no allowance is made in the estimate for lectures, nor for library\npurchases. . . Should donations be received provision can be made\nfor these items.\"\nThe usual monthly cash account was presented, and various accounts\npassed for payment.\nOn the application of Mr. Edmund Gurney, a grant not exceeding\n.\u00a310 was authorised to a Committee for Mesmeric Investigation.\nIt was agreed that a General Meeting should be held in the month\nof April, at the Rooms of the Society of British Artists, Suffolk-street,\nPall Mall, the chair to be taken at 8.30 p.m., and that the Council\nshould meet on the afternoon of the same day.\nDigitized by Google\n\fMareb,l885.] Journal Qf Boekt.'! .101' P8ychical Re8earcl,. 291\nGENERAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY.\nIt has been arranged to hold the next General Meeting on Friday.\nApril 24th, at the Rooms of the Society of British Artists.

The following\nnarratives, collected by Mr. Podmore, are obviously of very unequal\nevidential value; but even those which, from this point of view, are most\ndefective, have one or more features of interest for the investigator.\nThe numbers attached to the different narratives are for the\nconvenience of members of the Literary Committee. The letter L that\nstands before each number indicates that these narratives belong to\nthat part of the collection which is distinguished by the Committee as\nrelating to \" Phantasms of the Li\",-ing. \" It will be remembered that\nthe Committee include under this term apparitions or dreams occurring\nat or about the time of the death of the persons whom they represent.\nThe letters that follow the numberrefer to the classification of these\n\" Phantasms\" adopted by the Committee as the most convenient. They\nindicate that the state of the Agent (A) and of the Percipient (P) is\neither 'lW'rlnal (n), dying (d), Bleep (8), or some peculiar excitement (e).\nWe shall welcome any communication tending to throw further light\non any of these narratives.\nL.-79-An pa and n\n(Amended Version.)\nFrom Miss Deering, Louisville, Kentucky.\nI very distinctly remember that one day, a few years ago, my\nfather lay down for a few minutes, as at that time usual before going to\nhis office in the afternoon. Seated on a stool beside him, and with my\nleft hand enfolded in one of his, I read the book in which I was at the\ntime interested, for Dve or possibly seven minutes. At the end of that\ntime he turned his face toward me, and seeing that the room was\nshaded, remarked: \"Anna. you will injure your eyes reading in this\ndim light.\" \" And I do not particularly like this book,\" I responded.\nI held in my hand a historical novel, the name of which I am sorry I\ncannot recollect, but I remember vividly that the passage I had just\nread purported to be one of the last scenes in the life of Marie Antoi-\nnette, and I remember as distinctly that in that scene a tall man carried\na coffin from a room in which Marie Antoinette and some attendant\nladies were at the time standing. I remember that in the story that\ntall man stood prominently in the foreground, and that my mind was\nstrained under the part he took in that scene almost to the verge of\nrepugnance.\nIn reply to my father's question why I did not like the book, I\nreplied in tlubstance as in the foregoing, and he immediately told me\nDigitized by Google\n\fMarch,l885.] JOle,.fJall!f Societ!l.fol' PS!icflical Research. 293\nthat he had just seen what I had described, and had opened his eyes\nand turned his face toward me to dissipate the scene, which for the\nmoment he had looked upon as an isolated phantasm.\nANNA M. DEERING.\nLouisville, Kentucky, U.S., October 18tl~, 1884.\nFrom Mr. Deering.\nWhile I lay with my daughter's hand in mine, as she relates in the\naccompanying memoir, I fell into the semi-slumber usual with me on\nlying down to rest for a few minutes after my luncheon, early in the\nafternoon. At these times I very seldom fall asleep, but simply into a\nspecies of slumber, in which I frequently find myself in a kind of\nrayless or moonless moonlight, looking, and this usually with serene\npleasure, at near-by gardens, slopes, rivulets, and various little vistas,\nwhich more times than otherwise vanish at my bidding, and, except I\nfall asleep, are immediately replaced by others. Sometimes these are\npeopled with apparently living figures, and frequently these also dissolve\nat my bidding, and are replaced by others. There is, however, this\ndifference, any control I exercise for the purpose of a change seems to\nbe more immediate and more absolute over a change of figures than over\na change of scenes.\nI am quite sure that at these times I do not fall into any condition\nthat fairly can be called pathological.\n\u00b7Under the slumber now under consideration, my attention became\nfixed on a tall thin man, with head uncovered, beardless, and dressed in\nblack. He came toward the foot of the bed on which I lay from the\nleft; and perhaps I should note that my daughter sat upon my left.\nImmediately I saw several other figures; and though these stood out\u00b7\nside the lines or field of my direct vision, I remember distinctly that\nthey made on me an impression of sympathy with powerlessness. I\nmight think that the sympathy touched ma through the countenance\n()f the man, were it not that he impressed me with also the opposite of\npowerlessness. His age seemed to be about 50, his face oblong, a little\nsallow, seriously thoughtiul, and withal indicative of great but quiet\nfirmness in action, whether from a sense of duty based on his own\njudgment, or duty under a sense of obedience, I cannot determine,\nthough in the absence of allY appearance of the vindictive, I think, or\nat least am inclined to think, that alike his presence and his action were\nbased on simply an obedience to some rightful authority. This action\nwas a reverent stepping forward, and a silent laying of his hands on a\ncoffin that seemed to rest across the foot of the bed. The moment I\n8&W the coffin I thought: I do not like this scene; please go away anll\nlet something more agreeable come in. But the scene would not\nchange, and again I thought: Please go away and let something more\nDigitized by Google\n\f.294 Journal of Sodel!1 for Psychical Re8earch. [March, 1885.\nagreeable come in ; and again the scene would nOG change. He raised\nthe coffin, it seemed as easily as though it had been that of an infant,\nand was in the act of stepping backward, as though withdrawing from\na presence, when I thought: Then I will not prolong this slumber; I will\nopen my eyes and arouse myself. And, on immediately doing so, I spoke\nto my daughter as she narrates, and then without anything like amaze-\nment, listened to her description from the book.\nI have been minute, as in the foregoiI!g, because I wish to put\nevery feature of and every impression given me by the scene carefully\non record, against a search which I purpose to keep up for the book out\nof which my daughter at the time sat reading. She did not then or\never read to me what she had read, but simply and in her own language\ndrew the scene; and this in, perhaps, as few words as she has now\nwritten it, nor have we since that time in any particular way conversed\nabout it. My impression is that the book she ~d was an octavo in\npaper covers, but its name or author, or whose it was or what became\nofit, neither of us can recollect; nor do either of us at this time remem-\nber any of the scenes immediately preceding or attending the tragic\ndeath of Marie Antoinette as these are, or may be, recorded in history.\nWILLIAM DEERING.\nLouisville, Kentucky, U.S., October 21st, 1884.\nThis incident was originally related in the Louisville Medical News\nby Professor Palmer, a letter from whom is appended. .\nLouisville, Kentucky, U.S.A.,\nSeptemlJer 26th; 1883.\nThe article appearing on the other side is true in every particular.\nThe gentleman, a resident of this city, a man of high nervous organisa.-\ntion, was born in Belfast, U.S.A.

P.]\nNote.-Itis obvious that thevalue of this narrative, as affording evidence of\nThought-transference, must be proportional to the degree of exactness with\nwhich the correspondence between the dream and the description in the\nbook can be made out. It might, therefore, be considerably increased if the\nbook could be discovered. Even as it stands the coin(lidence is certainly\nremarkable; but as Miss Deering's description preceded her father's account\nof his vision, it is possible that its similarity to the description became\nunconsciously somewhat stronger in recollection than it was in reality.\nDigitized by Google\n\fMarch, 1885.] Journal oj Society for P8'!JcMcal Re86(11\u00b7ch. 295\nL.-I047-Ad pa\nFrom Mr. F. Teesdale Reed, Longfieet, Poole.\nI had an uncle who, after spending thirty-three years on board ship,\nleft the sea, got marrioo, and settled down near London. His only\nson and myself were constant playmates, and for a short time school-\nfellows also. My cousin's one great wish was to go to sea, but this, so\nfar from being encouraged, always provoked a stem rebuke, if even the\ntopic only was mentioned. At last Cousin Jack seemed to have got\nover his yearning for the naval service; he quietly bore with a good\ngrace what to him was a bitter disappointment. As he was now a. big\nlad it was necessary to find him something to do. A post was found for\nhim under my father in a house of business iR the City. Here he\ndid well, and soon won golden opinions from all about him. One day-\nit was Lord Mayor's Day, and the City was too excited to settle down\nto sober business-Jack asked my father for half a day's holiday and\nan advance of five shillings. The holidaywas granted a.nd he-was told\nhe could take the money and enter it in the proper hook. After that\nhe went, as was thought, for a feW hours' pleasure. He never returned.\nInquiries were made at every likely place, but to no purpose. His\nparents were utterly disconsolate at his disappearance. We all guessed\nthat he had gone off to sea, but none dared give utterance in the\nfather's presence to the thought, knowing how unwelcome such an\nexplanation would be. Months passed by and no news came. At\nlength-perhaps it was twelve or eighteen months afterwards-my\nthoughts were again directed to my missing cousin. It was in this\nway. One Sunday morning my father invited me to go with him to\nsee my uncle and aunt. On the road he told me that during the night\nhe had had a most remarkable dream, and he wished to test it as far as\nhe could, for he was strongly pl\u00b7rsuaded that it would be fulfilled. At .\nthe same time he urged me to notice the date and preserve in my\nmemory the details as far as possible. I may just say, in parenthesis,\nthat we continued our journey, paid the visit, but found that nothing\nhad been heard of my cousin. The dream, so far as I can recollect it\nat this distance of time, was somewhat as follows: The scene is in\na foreign port (guessed at the time to be Spanish). On board a British\nman-of-war that is anchored there a young man (my cousin Jack) is\ngiving instructions to some men at work in the rigging. He is ap-\nparently dissatisfied with what they are doing, for he hurries up, makes\nsome slight alteration, and then descends. A rung of the rope ladder\ngives way as his foot touches it, he falls backward, head first, and dies\ninstantly. The surgeon hurries to the spot, examines the body, but\nleaves it as he can do nothing there. Then arrangements are made for\nthe burial. The coffin is taken on shore, some of the officers and men\u00b7\naccompany it, and it is solemnly lowered into thepve. There\u00b7\nDigitized by Google\n\f296 Journal of Societylor Psyc'hicnl Reseal'ch. [March, 1685\nthe dream ended. Some time after my father (he had already ascer\u00b7\ntained the time it would take' for a letter to come from the Spanish\ncoast to England) asked me one morning if I still remembered his\nstrange drea:n. He then made me repeat it to him. After that he\nsaid: \" Well, if there is anything in it, your uncle will have heard\n60mething about it by this time, let us go and see him.\" When we\nreached the house we could see at a glance that something had hap-\npened. My father at once asked if there was any news yet of Jack.\nYes, that morning's post had brought a large envelope bearing the\nLisbon post-mark. It was written by one of the officers of a man-\nof-war that was then anchored at Lisbon, and its purpose \"!Vas to\nmake known the death of my cousin. After a very kind and favour-\nable notice of Jack's general conduct and abilities, it gave full details\nof his death and burial. Those details tallied exactly with the details\ngiven in my father's dream, and it occurred the very date of the\ndream. I was perfect.ly amazed. I inspected the letter and could not\nsee any point in which there was the slightest contradiction or even\ndivergence. Of course my uncle was then informed of the dream,\nand I feel sure the talk we then had about the matter helped my uncle\nto bear his bitter trial with more serenity than he would have done if\nwe had not been there with our visions from dreamland.\nF. T. R.\nLongHeet, Poole, 28t'~ October, 1884.\nT can quite understand your desire to verify, as far as possible,\nevery statement made, but unfortunately I shall not be able to furnish\nmuch corroboration. I have just a little; what there is I will place\nbefore you. I found the inclosed \"inspector's certificate.\" I see it\ncorrects my story in one point, and confirms it in another. I said that\nthe event happened about thirty-two years ago; this document is dated\n1847, i.e., thirty-seven years ago. At the time of writing the paper I\ndid not sufficiently think over the question of time. I would add that\nthe family consisted of my uncle, aunt-who are both dead-my cousin\nJohn (of whom I have written), and his sister, who is still alive in\nAustralia. She may be able to furnish more particulars. Her address\nI will procUf8 and forward to you in a few days' time. However weak\n:it may be in collateral evidence, I am positive as to the fact of the\ndream, and that I ha,\u00b7e fairly represented it in its essential points.-\nYours truly, F. T.

The vision, for I felt certain that I was\nawake and not dreaming, made a very strong and painful impression\nupon me, so milch so that the family where I was staying asked the\ncause of my troubled looks. I told them what I had seen, and at my\nhostess's *request made a note of the occllrrence. Months afterwards\nwe received the intelligence that my brother had died at Baroda, near\nSumatra, of dysentery. The d!l.te and hour of his death (as nearly as\ncould be calculated) coincided exactly with that of his appearance to me\nat Stroud (Gloucester). I am of a calm and unimaginative tempera.-\nment, and have never had any similar experience before or since.

He appeared to me to be very\npale, and looked sad, as I had seen him upon my last visit to him three\nmonths previous. I immediately spoke to my wife, who was sitting\nwithin a few feet of me, and said, \"Clara, there is something wrong\nat home; father is either dead or very sick.\" She tried to\npersuade me that it was my imagination, but I could not help\nfeeling that something was wrong.

My husband (Mr. S. S.\nFalkinburg) was in the employ of one John Ayers, buying staves.\nOn thp, evening of July llth, about 6.30 o'clock, he came into the\n\fMarch,l885.] Journal qf 8ociet!1 .for P8!lcllical Research. 301\nroom where I was sitting and laid down on the carpet with my little\nboy Arthur, complaining of being very tired and warm.\nEntering into conversation on some unimportant matter, _~rthur\nwent to him and laid down by his side.\nIn a few moments my :qotice was attracted by hearing Arthur\nexclaim:- \"Oh. papa, grandpa, grandpa, papa,\" at the same time\npointing with his little hand toward the ceiling.\nI looked in the direction he was pointing, but saw nothing.\nMy husband, however, said: \"Clara, there is something wrong at\nhome; father is either dead or very sick.\" I tried to laugh him out of\nwhat I thought an idle fancy, but he insisted that he saw the face of\nhis father looking at him from near the ceiling, and Arthur said,\n\"Grandpa was come, for he saw him.\" That night we were awakened\nby Artie again calling his pa to see grandpa. Well, my husband\nhas given you a detailed account, except that a short time after lie\nstarted, Monday, to go to Indianapolis, I received a letter calling him\nto the burial of his father; and some time after, in conversation with\nhis mother, it transpired that the time he and Artie ~w the vision\nwas within two or three minutes of the time his father died.\nThis, with my husband's, is about a., near as I can call to\nrecollection.\nHoping this may be what you requested, I remain, respectfully,\nMRS. CLARA T. FALKINBURG.\nNote.-The subsequent hallucinations of both percipients-if more than\nmere illusions-are a.n important fea.ture in the above narrative, however\nthey are to be expla.ined. We may infer from them that both Mr. Falkin-\nburg and his son have a certain predisposition to hallucination; hence perhaps\nsomewhat less weight is to be attached to the fact that Mr. Falkinburg docs\nnot recollect having had any similar experience before the one described. In\nany case the transfer or suggestion of the phantasm from the son to the\nfather is a phenomenon psychologically interesting.\nL.-I051-Ae pn\nFrom Capta.in P. (Known to F. P.)\nSome time at the enel of 1868 I was discussing with a lady of J?lY\nacquaintance the question of making compacts to appear after death. I\ndoubted whether such compacts could be fulfilled; she stoutly main-\ntained that they could be. Finally we agreed to make such a compact\nourselves-that whichever of us first died should appear after death to\nthe other. At the beginning of the next year I went on a voyage in\ntbe merchant ship, Edmund Graham, of Greenock, to Australia, and, on\nthe 22nd of June, when we were between the Cape of Good Hope and\nAustralia (lat. 40deg. S., long. 22 E.), and the ship running before a\nheavy gale of wind, the sea swept over the deck and washed seven of\nDigitized by Google\n\f3{)2 Journall!1 Society for P8!1cli.ica1 Rmarch.

I gave myself up for lost,\nand I remember well that I thought of the panorama of their past lives\nwhich drowning men are said to see, and hoped that the show would\n(lommence. Then I regretted I was without my oilskin, as the water\nwould have time to wet me through before death, and I expected to\nfind it very cold; as far as I can recollect, this was all that passed\nthrough my mind. The next moment I caught hold of a loose rope that\nwas hanging from the ship, and hauled myself on deck. The others\nwere drowned. This took place between 3 and 4 a.m. on June 22nd. A\nfew months afterwards I had a letter at Bombay, from my friend, in\nwhich she mentioned that on the night of the 22nd June she had seen\nme in her room.\nWhen I saw her again, I received from her 0. full account of the\ncircumstance. She told me that she woke up suddenly in tho night,\nand saw me at the other end of the room, and that I advanced towards\nher. Whether she noticed the dress which I was wearing I cannot\nsay. I have often since heard her describe the incident. As far as I can\nrecollect, she told me the precise time of the appearance; and my belief\nis that it coincided in time with my being washed overboard. Though\nI cannot recollect ca.lculating the difference of time, by reference to the\nlongitude, I think it ml)st likely that I did so and found the times to\n(lo1.Tespond. I was certainly, at that time, quite alive to the fact that\n22deg. of longitude would make 0. sensible difference in the apparent\ntime. . M. P.\nThe following is 0. portion of 0. letter from the percipient to\nCaptain P. :-\nI enclose the papers you gave me to look a.t the other night, and in\nlooking over the printed notes of the Society I see (as a Catholic) I can\nhave nothing to do with it.\nYou can tell your friend the reason I decline saying anything about\nit is because I am a Papist, and that I consider those sort of things\nmuch too sacred to make the topic of conversation at any modern\nscientific meeting.\nNote.-We have here a fair specimen of the large and varied class of\nobstacles which the present state of thought and feeling on the subject of\napparitions places in the way of our im\u00b7estigation.\nL.-I052-Ad pn\nFl'Om General H.

My only shelter was a tent, in which I lived for\nseveral months in the year. My parents, and only sister, about 22\nyears of age, were living at K., from which place letters used to take a\nweek reaching me. My sister and I were regular correspondents, and\nthe post generally arrived about 6 a.m., as I was starting to my work.\nIt was on the 18th April of that year (a day never to be forgotten) that\nI received a letter from my mother, stating that my sister was not feel-\ning well, but hoped to write to me the next day. There was nothing in\nthe letter to make me feel particularly anxious. After my usual out-\ndoor work, I returned to my tent, and in due course set to my ordinary\ndaily work. At 2 o'clock my clerk was with me, reading some\nnative documents that required my attention, and I was in no way\nthinking of my sister, when all of a sudden I was startled by seeing my\nsister (as it appeared) walk in front of me from one door of the tent to\nthe other, dressed in her night-dress. The apparition had such an effect\nupon me that I felt persuaded that my sister had died at that time. I\nwrote at once to my father, stating what I had seen, and in due time I\nalso heard from him that my sister had died at that time. .\nNovernlJer 11th, 1884. J. C.

Five miles away, Rev. A. M. Bridge was preaching at\nHampton FaUs,-with whom I sometimes exchanged pulpits. After a\nyear or so he gave up the work in this little parish, and. somewhat later\nentered upon an engagement in the town of East Marshfield, Mass., as\nthe railroad runs, nearly 80 miles from Exeter.\nOn Wednesday, December 13th, 1865, on waking in the morning, I\nremarked to my wife upon the very vivid and singular dream which I\nhad had, and related it fully. I had seen Mr. 1}ridge taken suddenly\nDigitized by Coog\n\f304 Journal qf Society for Psychical Re8earch. [March. 1885.\nand violently ill. He seemed to be in 0. school-room. He sank down\nhelpless, but was borne away by friendly hands and laid upon a. couch\nor lounge. I was by him, and assisted others in whatever way I could.\nBut he grew worse; even the open-air did not revive him; a. leaden\npallor soon spread over his features ; peculiar spots, which I had never\nnoticed before, like moles or discolourations of the skin, appeared upon.\nhis face, and after much suWering he died.\nImmediately after breakfast, an4 while we were again speaking of\nthe dream, a ring at the door admitted to my house Mr. Wells Healey,\nan cld parishioner of Mr. Bridge's, at Hampton Falls. I guessed the\nnature o~ his message. He had come to ask me to attend the funeral\nservices of his former minister, who had suddenly died two days before\n(Monday), at East Marshfield. Mr. Bridge's family had not removed\nthere, but he would be buried among the people he had so recently left.\nI attendcd the funeral as requested. I learned from the family and\nfriends the particulars of his death, which coincided remarkably in\nseyeral points with the dream a.lrea.dy repeated to my wife; and when\nI looked at the face of the dead mall as he lay in his coffin, my atten-\ntion was arrested and fixed by t\"'8 peculiar spots uprm t\"'8 fac8 to which\nI have alluded, and which were stereotyped upon memory by ths dream.\nSeptBmh8r 4t\"', 1884.\nl.

I have often had vivid dreams, always quickly enough forgotten,\nbecause nothing came of them. I have no doubt this would have\nbeen forgotten but that something did come of it, and so was often\nalluded to and retold afterward.

In the case cited, it would seem to mc th:;.t allY occult influence\naffecting my train of thought must rather have reached me from the\nliving-the mother and children at Hampton Falls-than from the\ndead father. 1\\ly impression is that the body was sent to the family\non the day after his death, so that it was present with them on the\nnight when the dream occurred. Very likely the circumstances of his\nillness and last moments had been detailed to them and others by\nfriends in attendance.

Also, I ought to say, that the morn-\ning her dear image appeared to me, a doctor arrived from London\nwhom she had sent to me by telegraphing to him from Nice, and this\ndoctor was the means of saving my life, as I was at thit time so ill that\n.he said I could not have lived more than four hours longer.\nC.M.W.\nIn a latter dated the 23rd January,1885, Miss \u00b7W. writes in answer to\n'Our inquiries, that her mother \"does not know anything ahout the\n~hawl forming part of my grandmother's dress at the time she saw the\n.apparition.\" She adds that Mrs. W. has seen no other hallucinations,\n.and that she had no reason to suspect her mother's illness at the time.\nMiss W. writes: \"I clearly remember, in 1874, my mother in her\n.dangerous illness seeing my dear grandmother come up to the foot of\nthe bed. My mother has often told me since that her mother was\nwearing a certain crimson shawl she was very fond of, that her\nspectacles had dropped, and she looked over them at my mother, with\n:sad inquiring eyes.

In the case above given, however, it is\nnot quite clear how far the vision coincided with a sudden and marked change\nin the state of the agent. Also it is poSBible that the doctor's visit, or the\nexpectation of it, may have called up her mother's image to Mrs. W.'s mind,\nand that her illneSB may have rendered herspecially liable to hallucination.

The carriage did not upset. The facts are as follows :-My\naunt has a very light cab built by my uncle especially for her, and on\nDigitized by Google\n\fMarch, 1885.]' Journal of Society for P8ychical Re8earch,. 309\none occasion my aunt was driving along a narrow road, when her\n(:oachman whipped up the horses, and began driving at a furious pace.\nMy aunt alarmed, looked through the little window at the baek of the\n-carriage, and saw a great dray with a runaway horse tearing after the\nQrriage. Just as it must have run into it and smashed it the coach-\nman turned the cab into an opening in the road. It was the only place\nin the road where the cab could have stopped, and it was the coachman's\nonly hope to reach it, and the dray rushed by, leaving the cab un-\nharmed. It did a great deal of damage, and the driver was killed.\nYou see mother did not dream exactly the facts of the case, but only\nthat my aunt wa.s nearly killed by a carriage accident.\nAs to the\" other intimations of danger,\" &c., they are this, that\nwhenever anything happens to those dear to her she always knows\nthere is 80metlting happening. For instance, I was laid up with a very\nbad cough and cold when away from her last year, and she wrote me an\nanxious letter, saying, she knew I was ill, for she had an idea I had\ninflammation of the lungs. Last month I was suffering dreadfully\nfrom toothache and determined 1 would go and have two teeth out\nwithout saying anything to mother for fear of worrying her; she\nthought I was going for a walk, but all the time I was gone she was so\nunhappy about me, and S. told me when I had come back that mother,\nhad cried and been wretched all the time. You see the things are not\nbig enough to attract much attention, but we in the house know them\nto be true.\nNote.-We have no evidence in the case of the dream of the carriage acci-\ndent that it took place on the nightof the day on which the accident occurred,\nand even if it did so, we should have to suppose either a deferred\nimpression or that Mrs. S. was in sleep repeating her experience of the\nday. But probably no one who accepts the general fact of telepathic\ncommunication will be disposed to conclude that the coincidence was a\nmerely accidental one. Mrs. W.'s impression, in the borderland between\nsleeping and waking, of the danger to her sister's child, is, however,\nmore impressive, both because it was more than a dream, and because the\ntime coincidence seems in tIllS case to have been ascertained to be exact.\nWith regard to Mrs. W.'s less definite impressions whenever anything of\nimportance happens to anyone very dea.r to her, it is difficult (as Miss\nW. suggests) to make them evidentially valuable without constant and\ncareful notes because of the double indefiniteness--the difficulty (1) of\ndeciding what is an event or experience of importance, and (2) of\ndistinguishing clearly a peculiar feeling that something is happening from\nvague anxiety about absent friends. If Mrs. W. could continuously for\nsome little time make a note in writing, with as much detail as possible,\nwhenever a. feeling of this kind occurred, and a.fterwards add the\nconfirmation, much interesting light might be thrown on the subject.\nDigitized by Coog\n\f310 Journal of Society ,forPsyckic,41 Research.

The narrative, which is in the\nFrench language, is too long for insertion here, but the English abstract.\ngiven below will place our readers in possession of its principal\nfeatures. We retain the first person in the narration for the sake of\ncleanless.\nIn the year 1869 I was Officer of Health in the Hellenic army_\nBy command of the War Office I was attached to the garrison of the\nIsland of Zante. As I was approaching the island in a steamboat, to.\ntake up my new position, and at about two hours' distance from the\nshore, I heard a sudden inward voice say to me over and over again\nin Italian, \"Go to Volterra.\" I was made almost dizzy by the\nfrequency with which this phrase was repeated. Although in perfectly\ngood health at the time I became seriously alarmed at what I con-\nsidered as an auditory hallucination. I had no association with\nthe name of M. Volterra, a gentleman of Zante with whom I\nwas not even acquainted,although I had once seen him,ten years before.\nI tried the effect of stopping my ears, and of trying to distract myself\nby conversation with the bystanders; but all was useless, and I con-\ntinued to hear the voice in the same way. At last we reached land; I\nproceeded to the hotel and busied myself with my trunks, but the voice\ncontinued to harass me. After a time a servant came and announced to\nme that a gentleman was at the door who wished to speak with me at\nonce. \"Who is the gentleman 1\" I asked. \"M. Volterra,\" was the\nreply. And M. Volterra entered, weeping violently in uncontrollable\ndistress, and imploring me to follow him at once, and see his son, who.\nwas in a dangerous condition. I found a young man in a state of\nmaniacal frenzy, naked in an empty room, and despaired of by all the\ndoctors of Zante for the last five years. His aspect was hideous, and\nrendered the more distressing by constantly-recurring. choreic spasms,.\naccompanied by hissings, howlings, barkings, and other animal noises..\nSometimes he crawled on his belly like a serpent; sometimes he fell into.\na.n ecstatic condition on his knees; sometimes he talked and quarrelled\nwith imaginary interlocutors. The violent crises were often followed by\nperiods of profound syncope.\nWhen I opened the door of his room he darted upon me furiously,\nbut I stood my ground and seized him by the arm, looking him fixedly\nin the face. In a few moments his gaze fell; he trembled allover, and\nfell on the floor with his eyes shut.

During that\ntime many interesting phenomena were observed.\n1. He became clairvoyant as to his own malady, foreseeing the\ndays and hours of his own attacks, and the nature of\neach.\n2. Sometimes I mesmerised him from my own house, without his\npreviously knowing of it.\n3. In the somnambulic state he prescribed for himself; and .thO'\nexhibition of the remedies prescribed (though these were\napparently insignificant) was f9110wed by an improvement in\nhis symptoms.\n4. Once, when mthe mesmeric trance, he ordered me to let him\nsleep for eight days continuously, without waking him, but\nmerely causing him to drink one glass of orange-water, and\nplacing in his mouth some morsels of gum. He did, in fact,\nsleep for eight days, during which time no shouts or pinche!!\nfrom allY one could awake him, although he replied at once\nto questions which I addressed to him from an adjoining\nroom.\n5. He used to discern me at a distance during his crises, and once,\nat my request, he described with great accuracy my house\nat Corfu.\nThe cure, however, was not uninterrupted., Often in the mesmeric\nsleep he seemed to become a different person, expressed hatred for me,\nspat at me, and tried to abstract himself from my influence. I con-\ntended against these moods with all my might, and finally he would\nbecome calm again and say \"that it was not himself who had thus\nacted.\" A month before his final cure he foresaw its date, but warned\nme that I should have a severe conflict with him of all hour's dUration,\na.t a date which he announced before~and. After that struggle, if my\nwill prevailed, he would be completely restored to reason. At the\nappointed hour I proceeded to mesmerise him, in his father's presence.\nAs soon as he fell under my influence he became wildly excited, called\nme his assassin, implored his father with tears to turn me out of the\nhouse, and gradually became more and more convulsed and haggard,\n.with continual cries of \"The doctor is killing me !\" I continued to\nmesmerise him, exerting the whole force of my will, and precisely at the\nend of an hour the youth became unconscious, and fell on his mattres.~,\ndragging me down with him in his fall. In 20 ~nutes more he awoke\ninto the mesmeric trance, and said, \"Doctor, you havl'l saved me. I\nam now perfectly cured.

[March, 1885.\nCount Gonemys proceeds to discuss the nature of the purposeful\nvoice, or auditory monition, which warned him on the steamer of the\napproaching need of his services. Count Gonemys inclines to the helief\nthat this call emanated from lOme third intelligence,-not from the\nmind of the distressed father. .. Let us asaume,\" he says, ee that M.\nVolterra in his despair at his son's condition had read in the newspaper\nthat an officer of health was expected at Zante, and had ardently wished\nfor the arrival of a new physician who might save the boy. Let us\nfurther suppose that this strong wish had radiated from him on every\nside, till it encountered the physician in question. Nevertheless, this\ndesire of his could not be formulated as an order, an admonition i-and\nthis order could not be given in the tl,ird per80n, e Go to Volterra.\u00b7\ninstead of 'Come to me.'\"\nNow here we shall be inclined to differ from Count Gonemys. In\nour view, if 0. telepathic impact were communicated from M. Volterra.\nto Count Gonemys, the veridical hallucination to which it gave rise\nmight.quite conceivably assume its definite shape in Count Gonemys'\nbrain, and represent itself to his consciousness, not as an appeal from a\nsuffering stranger, but as an order from some external power. The\nimpulse to the hallucination, in such cases, is given, as we argue, by\nthe agent, but the form of the hallucination is determined by the\nspecial tendencies, or capacities, of the percipient'8 mind or brain. The\nmonitory turn of the sentence would, therefore, not prevent us from\nclassing it among our cases where the critical distress of one person\nrepresents itself in the consciousness of another.\nThe absence of previous rapport between M. Volterra and Count\nGonem},s is a more serious difficulty. It is, however, a difficulty\nwhich has met us in many other cases, (forming a class in our Pr0-\nvisional Index), where, nevertheless, we have thought that the hypotht'sis\nof an extraneous intelligence need not at present be discussed. For we\nhave as yet so little conception of the mode in which the agent's mind\nexercises its telepathic impulse that we cannot lay down any definite\nline as to the percipients whom that impulse may affect.\nWe hope shortly to print a second communication received from\nCount Gonl:mys.

I called upon Mr. I. O. Howard\nTaylor (an Associate of the Society for Psychical Research), who first\ndrew your attention to the matter, and ascertained from him the\naddress of the person who was inhabiting the house at the time the\ndisturbances were said to occur. He is a clerk, and we may call him\nMr. X. He gave his evidence clearly and very emphatically; he is an\nexceedingly intelligent witness, but I consider him to be of a somewhat\nnervous and excitable temperament, although, of course, his occasional\nhighly-strung manner may have been due to the nature of the circum-\nstances which he was relating. His statements were to the following\neffect:-\nIn September, 1883, he returned from his marriage trip and, with\nhis wife, took possession of a house in -- Road. He cannot say\nhow soon disturbances were noticed with extra interest, for it was\nseveral months before the noises wbich were heard in the house were\nrecognised as of an unusual character. However, when Mr. and Mrs.\nX. were in their bedroom at night, tramping souuds, like people occupy-\ning the sitting-room they bad just left, were beard, thp. handle of 0.\ndoor at the foot of the stairs was once or twice unmistakably tried, and\nsounds of footsteps mounting the stairs were heard. Instant investiga-\ntion failed to discover a cause for these sounds, and their frequent\nrepetition led to the conclusion that the house was \"haunted by a\nhaunt,\" to use }tIro X.'s own expression. The first unmistakable\nproof, however, of the correctness of this. conclusion was presented to\nhim one night in the form of an apparition. He was in bed\nwith his wife in the spare bedroom - 0. window having\nbeen broken in their own room. His wife was asleep;\nhe could not sleep, but was lying quite still, and wide\nawake. Suddenly, on the first stroke of 12 from 0. clock in\nthe city, there was an audible \"swish,\" and the figure of a man\nstood before him, at the foot of the bed. The figure was that of a.\nrespectable old gentleman of about 60, with sharp, well-marked features.\nHe was dressed in a black coat and waistcoat, and stood quite motion-\nless, staring intently at him. Mr. X., without the ability to do other-\nwise, stared in return, until the last stroke of 12, when the apparition\nappeared to raise its arms and sink through the floor. This experience\nhad a very marked effect upon his nerves, and during the fo~r months\nwhich elapsed between that date and the time they were compelled. to\nvacate the premises, he was continually apprehensive and nervous,\n\f314 Jom'nlliof Societ!\/ for Pa!lchicol Reaearcll.

This arose from a sense of fear. which he could not over-\ncome. even if by so doing he could have possessed himself of a hand-\nsome reward. He did not mention his experience to his wife,\nnor to anyone j she, however, did not fail to observe his\nchanged behaviour and looks, and frequently remarked upon\nthe facts, as did also their friends and neighbours. The\nnoises still continued, and formed the subject of much speculation\u00b7\nbetween them; the servant frequently heard footsteps walking up and\ndown the kitchen stairs, and at night they were frequently heard, .ery\ndistinctly and unmistakably,in different parts of the house. The servant,\ntoo, says she sometimes heard subdued voices and other vocal sound~\nbut she seems hazy in separating these from those product>d by the\nwoman next door, who suffers from a chronic cough. But the one\nmanifestation which brought about their retreat from the house occurred\nabout 8.30 in the e.ening, in the lo.st week of September. 1884. Mrs..\nX., the s~rvant, and a little girl who had been taking ~ with\nthem, \"Were sitting in the back room of the two which form the groulld~\nfloor. They were chatting unconcernedly, and Mrs. X. was assisting\nthe little girl with some painting, standing with her back to the\nwindow, which overlooks the yard. Suddenly, apparently from a vacant\nchair which stood beneath the window, there came a loud tJigTt, which\nwas quickly followed by five more low. go.sping sighs, Il.S from a strong\nman in great llOdily and mental anguish: then 0. pause of 0. few seconds,\nfollowed by another sigh, much louder than the preceding ones, and\npartaking more of the nature of 0. groan. The three hearers were\nconsiderably frightened and upset: :lUrs. X. WIl.S seized with a violent\ncramp ill her side, the little girl was fearfully ill, and the servant had\nan attack of hysteria, and, as soon as they recovered the use of their\nlimbs, they lost no time in leaving the house. As they left the room,\nand were entering the front one, which opens into the street, they heard\nthree (7 two) raps on the wall of the staircase as they,passed it. Mr.\nX., meanwhile, was at his business: he returned home to find the\nhouse locked up, and a neighbour explained to him what had occurred,\nand told him where to find his wife. He found her, with the servant, at\nthe house of a friend. Both of them were veri ill and\nhysterical, and it was only after considerable discussion and\npersullosion that they could be induced to ret,urn. to the house\nfor one more night. Ultimately they did return, and lVlr. X.\nwent upstairs to wash his hands. Then came his turn to be again\nstartled. As he was passing the spare room he declares. that he dis-\ntinctly heard a woman's whisper, saying, \"Hark! the master of the\nhouse has returned; we must depart.\" A sound of footsteps followed.\napparently crossing the room, and then ensued a succession of sobs and\n\fMarch,l885.] Journal of Societ!\/ lor Psychical Research. 315\nwails, such as might be caused by a female in deep distress. In spite of\nall this they went to bed, and passed the night as best they\"could. Mrs.\nX. was dosed with spirits to induce aleep,-for her husband was\nbecoming seriously alarmed about her-and the next day they left the\nhouse, taking up their quarters in that of a friendly neighbour. A fort--\nnight later they took the house which they now occupy, and had their\nfurniture removed from the troublesome one. This latter has 110W been\nempty for the past two months. I had the opportunity of questioning\nMr. and Mrs. X. and the servant separately; their accounts agree\npretty accurately, and the experiences appeo.r to have been distributed\namongst them in this way :-\nMr. X. : Apparition; sounds of footsteps about the rooms, and up\nand down stairs; whisperings and sobbings; door-handles tried. Mrs.\nX.: Sighs and groans; raps; sounds of footsteps (similar to those\nheard by her husband); door-handles tried. Servant: Sighs and\ngroans; raps; footsteps (similar to those heard by her master and\nmistress) and confused whispering in the spare room, from which room\nher bedroom leads. The little girl who heard the sighs, groans, and\nraps, in company with Mrs. X. and the servant, can testify to that\neffect, but I was unable to see her. From the manner in which their\nevidence was given, and from their own remarks, it seems pretty clear\nthat it has been repeated to one and another a considerable number of\ntimes, and the little differences of detail, which evidently once existed\nin the impressions of each, have now been corrected and straightened\nout, until the accounts form a fairly harmonious whole. It is clear that\nthe matter has been well talked over amongst their immediate\nneighbours, and Mr. and Mrs. X. have come in for a large\namount of croas-questioning, doubt, and ridicule. Three times\n& few friends, with Mr. X., have watched in the house\nat night, but nothing has happened, with the exception of\nnoises purposely made in the next house, with the object of\nfrightening the watchers for a joke. The disturbances are said to have-\nmostly occurred between 10 and 12 at night. I went about 10 o'clock\nwith Mr. X. to examine the house, and stayed there about two\nhours. It is a very tiny place, and .consists of a basement, groun\"d\nflool', and first floor. . The kitchen is little better than n. cellar, and,\nalthough the house is not at all old, its construction is not of a modern\nkind. The street door opens right into the front room, and no space is\nlost in unnecessary passages, or landings. The foot of the staircase\nwhich leads to the first Hoor is right in the back ground-floor room.\nThe house is semi-detached, and has a garden in front, and a yard at\nthe back, which is separated from the side road by a brick wall. In\nthis yard men have been known to get, and the shutters were once\ntried by someone who was heard to decamp over the wall.\nDigitized by Google\n\f316 Journal oj 80cietu for P'!lcMcal Jle8earcA. [March. l885..\n.Any noise made in the side road by passers-by could be\nplainly heard in the back room (the room in which the\nsighs were heard) and the small size of the house renders\nmovements in the adjoining premises plainly audit>le. I, myself, heard\nstrange sounds, but could account for nearly all of them. They were\neaused by the next door people going up and down stairs, by their fire\nbeing poked, by their voices, by passers in the street, and by the\nvibration of distant carts. In addition to these there were some sounds\nwhich I could not exactly localise or account for, but they only consisted\nof such creaks and strains as one is almost sure to hear in a completely\nempty house, or, indeed, in any other house if intently listened for.\nSuch is the result of my inquiries. The evidence seems strong and\ndecisive, and is now not easily shaken, but it is the opinion of the friends\nand neighbours with whom I came in contact that the apparition was\ndue to a dream image; the sighs heard by Mrs. X. and the other two\nwere probably attributable to some cause existing in the side road-the\neffect of which cause upon the trio in the back parlour was probably\nheightened by the growing conviction that the house was haunted. The\nother noises are popularly accounted for by ascribing them to the\nnatural ones made in the next house, and I can well conceive that a\nwatchful imagination might be well fed from this source alone. Mr. X.\nis aaid to be imaginative and somewhat excitable, and it is suggested\nthat upon returning from work, and finding his wife and servant in\nhysterics, his combined feelings of nervousness, and determination not\nto be frightened in his own house, caused him to construe the wheezing\nand coughing of the woman next door into the whispered sentence that\n\"the master had returned\"; the former emotion being responsible for\nthe illusion, and the latter for its character. The words,\n.. Hark! the master has returned, we must depart\" were heard\nproceeding from the dark spare bedroom, and I must confess that\nwhen I stood in this room and listened to the gasps of the patient\nnext door (for'slle was coughing 110 great deal that night) the same\nthoughts had occurred to me before they were revived by the\nneighbours, At any rate, such is the substance of the belief of one\n~ho spent a night watching in the house. For my own part, if\nI had not heard the account of the disturbances fir,t-lw,nd, I\nshould unhesitatingly say, after an examination of the house and its\nsurroundings, that they are to be satisfactorily accounted for upon a\npurely natural and easily found basis. But when one hears the\nemphatic way in which Mr. X. declares that he was wide awake when\nhe saw the apparition, and heal'S Mrs. X. and the servant deckre that\nthe sighs were undoubtedly in tlUJ room, and not outside the window,\nit is felt that they either must have seen and heard what is stated, or\nthat self-deception was at work to a. very considerable extent.

In other words, one feels that the account has\ngrown. Mrs. X. is a very young woman, very voluble, and fond of\nventilating her religious creed. She seems quickly to jump to uncharit-\nable conclusions, for her theory is that because the harmless old landlady\ndoes not care to recognise the supposed haunt as a fact, it necessarily\nproves that her husband, who died peacefully in the house, must have\nmurdered a baby, or been guilty of some other crime for which he is\ncondemned to haunt the premises. This is considered to be a very\nsatisfactory explanation of the old lady's lack of sympathetic interest\nin the matter; and her attempts to quell a report which might prove\ndamaging to her property ate at once hailed as sufficient proof that her\nhusband was the ghost, and plainly show a desire to shield his sin, and\nconceal its ghostly consequences. Such a mental attitude on the part\nof the principal witness seems materially to detract from the effect\nwhich her account might otherwise have.\nThe house 1S again let, and is to be taken possession of on Monday,\nNovember 24th, 1884.

No doubt, here as elsewhere, the\n\"personal equation\" will have to be taken into account, but I do not think\nit will greatly modify the rosults attained.\nMy objects have been to ascertain by personal experiments (1) whether\nit is possible to transfer an impression made on one brain directly to another\nwithout the use of any of the ordinary channels of communication, and\n(2), if so, the conditions under which the transference is made. In almost\nall eases an ordinary pack of cards was used to supply the brain-pictures.\nIt did not take long to convince me that this direct transference of a\nl)icture from one- brain to another was possible. In fact, I was soon struck\nby the comparative facility of the operation under favourable conditions. I\nallow that my method of estimating results was not exactly that laid down\nby other observers. I attached (n.s I still attach) less importance than others\nto absolute accuracy in the transfervnce of the picture. In such cases, as it\n8eems to me, the results are to be judged, not by mathematical, but logical\nlaws. The point to be considered is this: Is there a reasonable certainty\nthat the picture has been seen, although, perhaps, not with absolute distinct-\nneBB 1 The following record of expgriments made on the 2nd February, 1885.\nwith the help of Mr. W.

And I consider that such a list is at least as valuable as another\nshorter one which I might give, in which, out of 6 cards, 4 were transferred\nwith perfect accuracy to the brain of the percipient.\nI have taken much pains to find out what is the nature of the impression\nmade on the percipient ;\u00b7and I have come to the conclusion that, in the large\nmajority of cases in which the answer is correct, the impression made is\npictorial. It is not a suggestion, but an actual image that is conveyed.\nSometimes a suggestion is imagined, but in this case the answer is generally\nwrong. I have often asked: \"Did you seem to sce the card 1\" without\ngiving a hint as to whether the card named were right or wrong. Almost\ninvariably when the card was wrong, the percipient (llOt knowing the fact)\nwould reply: \"No, I didn't see it; but something seemed to tell me it was\nthat one.\" On other occasions, when the card was rightly named, the\npercipient (equally uncertain of the fact) would say: \"Yes; I seemed to\nsee that quite distinctly.\"\nThis view was confirmed by my own experience as percipient. I have\nhad but little practice in this capacity, and have on various OccasiOllS entirely\nfailed to get any l'esults wortll mentioning; but 011 two occasiOll8 I was mOI'e\nfortunate. On one of these I named rightly several figures in succession.\nNow, these figures I saw most distinctly with my eyes closed; they appeared\nsomewhat large, and distinctly, though faintly, luminous against a back-\nground of darkness; and when I saw them I had the absolute conviction\nthat they were the right ones. On another occasion I saw in much the same\nway some cards, but not with the same distinctneBB. The card would appear\nand disappear so rapidly that I had a difficulty in counting the pips. It was,\nfor instance, very difficult tl) distinguish between an eight and a 10. It was\nequally difficult to make out the suit. There was abeolutely 110 indication of\ncolour. When I had satisfied my mind that the card was a 10, it looked\nsomething like the 10 of diamonds, but with the sharp comers of the\ndiamonds rounded oft'. It proved to be the 10 of clubs. .\nBeing convinced that, in my experiments at any rate, tlle impression con-\nveyed was pictorial, I endeavoured, by tlle aid of a black bandage, to make\nthe darkness as complete as pOBBible before the eyes of tlle percipient whilst\nI arranged for a'very bright light to fall upon the card. My best results\nhave been secured under these conditions. Anotller important point seemed\nto be to devise some means by which the instant of transference should be\naccentuated. At first I tried saying \"one-two-threc-\" the \"three\" to\nbe the crisis point, but, fancying that the suggestion of any numbers might\nhave a tendency to confuse, I substituted three taps 011 the card, the third\nbeing harder than the previous two. It is, I think, impoBBible to keep the\nmind concentrated on a particular card, nor do I think it neceBSarily an\nadvantage to try to do 80. I believe the transmiBBion and tlle perception to\nbe an instantaneous process which may be repeated, but cannot be sustained.\nI do not think that the attempt at repetition is very often successful, as the\nimpreslion has already lost its freshness. For this reason I 800n gave up\nallowing or attempting second .. tries.\" Many of the cards seen with\nDigitized by Google\n\f320 Journal oj Socief!1 jor P8!1chical Re8earch.

On the other hand carda\nwhich took a long time to see were either entirely wrong or only partially\nright.\nTo sum up, I come to the conclusion that in my experiments the impres-\nsion made was pictorial; that it was conveyed instantaneously; that colour\ncould not be conveyed but form only (spades were constantly confused with\nhearts). In this connection I may mention that I have never succeeded in\ngetting the ace of spades correctly named. It has always been described as\na coun-card.\nI may add a few other details. In my experience the sensitiveness\nrequisite for the reception of brain.impressions is very evanescent. In the\ngreat bulk of my experiments the carda first taken were the ones moat readily\nand clearly seen. The faculty was practically exhausted after about 10 or\n12 attempts. I may mention that, after two decided failures, I always\nnow break off. It is, in my opinion, most important to allow nothing to\noccur which would tend to weaken the faith of operatoror percipient in their\nrespective powers. I attribute, in fact, a great part of what success I have\nachieved to my constant efforts to convinco the percipient of the possibility\nof seeing the cards. A long record of failures is most disheartening and\nindeed paralysing. The impression of even a single failure is to be avoided\nif poss~ble. For this reason I do not endorse what your committee say in\ncircular No. I : \"If tho first trial is a failure, the percipient should learn that\nfact from the silence of the experimenter.\" In my opinion he should be\ncarefully guardod from learning that fact at all until the experiments are\nover. This is another reason why no second trial should be allowed, as II.\nsecond trial implies failure in the first.\nIt sometimes happens that two cards present themselves successively to\nthe mind of the percipient. As a rule, in this case I found that it was the\nfirst which was the right one, or the nearost to the right one. On the few\noccasions when it was not so, the second card was described as appearing\nmuch moro vividly and distinctly than tho first.\nOn somo occasions the sCance has been a complete failure. On these\noccasions there has always been some obvious physical reason, such as a cold\non the part ot the percipient or myself, or the presence of some visitor who,\nwithout intending it, introduced 0. disturbing element. It is this last\ndifficulty that makes it almost useless to try to reproduce the experiments\nbefore strangers. The slightest uneAsiness on the part of the percipient, or\neven over\u00b7anxiety to succeed, is sufficient to destroy the sensitiveness.\nI might add more, but I will not trespass further on your space. On\nsome future occasion I hope to furnish some notes with respect to clair-\nvoyance.-I am, faithfully yours,\nNew Athenreum Club, S.W.,\nFebruary, 1885.\nA.
