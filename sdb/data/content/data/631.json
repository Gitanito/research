The advertisement for the journal in The Nautilus in March 1918 said the journal was devoted to \"Broad 'New Thought,' Mental Science, Oriental Philosophy, Personal Magnetism, Psychic Science, Numerology, Metaphysical Healing, Advanced Occultism, Practical Psychology, Transcendental Mysticism, Practical Philosophy, The Esoteric Teachings, Practical Metaphysics, Mental Physical Culture, Yogi Philosophy, the Power of Thought.\"  Contributions by or excerpts from T.J. Shelton, A. Osborn Eaves, Paul Foster Case, Clara M. Codd (who later became editor), Henry Victor Morgan, Helen Wilmans, Oscar Nystrom (on the \"Cabbala\"), and Atkinson under his own name and a variety of pseudonyms, notably \"A Western Occultist.\"  Atkinson (1862-1932) was an industry in himself, publishing books under his own name and as Theron Q. Dumont, Swami Panchadasi, Swami Bhakta Vishita, Yogi Ramacharaka (said to be a collaboration with an Indian named \"Baba Bharata\"), Three Initiates, Magus Incognito, Theodore Sheldon, and others.  He was one of those New Thought teachers who discovered the power (and profit) of \"lessons\" of private teachings.  Atkinson then began his own Yogi Publication Society in Chicago and Advanced Thought Publishing Company in the same city, the publisher of Advanced Thought and also publisher of one of Dr. Alexander James McIvor-Tyndall's works (see the note under The Swastika).  Atkinson was a frequent contributor to Elizabeth Towne's Nautilus as well, and was the editor of Sydney B. Flower's New Thought beginning in 1901.  The American Medical Association, as part of its crusade against quacks, has collected a dossier on the Advanced Thought Publishing Company and especially its shameless advertisements, which included solicitations from Captail George W. Walrond, Yacki Razizun, O. Hashnu Hara, Rosa Baughan, Hancil Cordrey, and many others of the New Thought hucksters of the period.
