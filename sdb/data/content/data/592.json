Charles Richet\n(Professeur de Physiologie \u00e0 la Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine de Paris).\nDiscours prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1905.\nMesdames, Messieurs,\nPuisque j'ai l'honneur de parler aujourd'hui en votre\nnom, je tiens d'abord \u00e0 exprimer ici nos respects et notre\ngratitude \u00e0 notre pr\u00e9sident, M. le professeur Barrett, qui, d\u00e8s les\npremiers jours de votre Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, lui a donu\u00e9 tout son talent et\ntout son labeur. Nul de nous ne se consolerait de ne plus\nl'avoir comme pr\u00e9sident, si nous n'avions pas la certitude\nqu'il continuera \u00e0 nous apporter, comme par le pass\u00e9, le pr\u00e9cieux\nappui de ses conseils et de sa haute science.\nPourtant il n'est pas besoin de vous dire combien je suis\nfier d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 votre pr\u00e9sident. Et ma reconnaissance\n\u00e9gale mon \u00e9motion. C'est la premi\u00e8re fois qu'\u00e0 un \u00e9tranger\nrevient cette dignit\u00e9, et j'en sens tout le prix.\nA vrai dire, j'ai tort de prononcer le mot d'\u00e9tranger; car\nje me flatte d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 un des premiers adh\u00e9rents de la\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 des recherches psychiques. Elle est aujourd'hui incon\ntest\u00e9e et prosp\u00e8re ; mais elle a connu des temps moins favo\nrables.\nAussi bien me permettrez-vous, en d\u00e9butant, de vous rap\npeler un souvenir tout \u00e0 fait personnel et intime, car il \u00e9voque\nla m\u00e9moire d'amis qui me sont bien chers, d'hommes illustres\nque vous avec tous connus, et qui ont jet\u00e9 tant d'\u00e9clat sur\nnotre Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Edmond Gurn\u00eby, Henri Sidgwick, et surtout\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Myers.\n\fL.] La Metapsychique. 3\nC'etait en 1882. II y a dtja presque un quart de siecle.\nLe premier volume de vos bulletins venait de paraitre, con-\ntenant des histoires curieuses et etranges, des experiences sur\nla transmission de la pense\"e ; des recits de maisons hantees,\nde fant6mes veridiques ; et en me\"me temps une sorte de pro\nfession de foi, prudente et bardie tout ensemble, indiquant la\nferme resolution de donner a 1'etude de ces plie\"nomenes la pre\ncision scientifique qui leur avait manque jusqu'alors.\nCe livre, qui repondait a mes secretes aspirations, fit grande\nimpression sur moi. J'etais convaincu dejJi\u2014et je le suis\ndavantage aujourd'hui\u2014que la science classique n'avait pas\nencore deVoile\" toute la ve>ite contenue dans 1'univers ; et\nque 1'inexplicable (ou 1'inexplique\") gouvernait le monde. Aussi\netais-je heureux de voir des savants, audacieux et sans pre-\njuges, poursuivre re\"solument la conquete du mystere par la\nvoie de 1'expe\"rimentation rigoureuse. Mais, si tel fut mon\nsentiment, ce fut loin d'etre 1'opinion ge\"ne\"rale. De toutes\nparts, les critiques, sarcastiques ou pe\"dantes, affluerent. Et\nceux qui ne daignerent pas critiquer remplacerent la raillerie\net la discussion par le silence ; un silence hostile et obstine\".\nLes spirites memes, comprenant mal que si peu de place fut\nfaite h la theorie, furent sans bienveillance pour la nouvelle\nSocie\"te psychique. Indifference, scepticisme, raillerie, hostilite :\ntels furent les premiers succes dans le monde de votre tenta\ntive gene\"reuse.\nMaintenant que bien des anne\"es ont passe\", nous pouvons dire\nque ce debut peu triomphal ne fut pas un malheur. II est\nbon que les tentatives nouvelles et hardies soient re9ues par\nle de\"nigrement ; car ce denigrement est f^cond ; il encourage\na la lutte ; il provoque des experiences nouvelles ; il stimule\nles e\"nergies. Au lieu de maudire nos contradicteurs, nous\ndevrions les remercier ; car ils nous empe'chent de sommeiller\nsur le commode oreiller de la vanite satisfaite.\nA ce moment (1882), je ne connaissais aucun d'entre vous.\nMais votre initiative me donna une stimulation puissante. Et\nje re\"solus, de mon cote, de travailler dans le meme sens.\nSilencieusement et tout seul, en 1882, 1883, je fis quelques\nexperiences sur la lucidite et la suggestion mentale, qui con-\nfirmerent plusieurs des tails affirmes dans vos premiers\nbulletins, et je les publiai dans la Revue philosophique. Quelques\n\f4 M. Charles Richet. [part\njours apr\u00e8s je recevais une lettre d'Edmond Gurney, o\u00f9 il\nm'exprimait toute sa joie, et, si je puis dire, sa reconnaissance,\npour l'appui impr\u00e9vu que venaient apporter \u00e0 l'\u0153uvre, in\naugur\u00e9e par lui, mes modestes tentatives d'exp\u00e9rimentation.\nNous nous rencontr\u00e2mes, et \u00e0 Paris et \u00e0 Londres ; et je\npus alors m'initier \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e de cet homme \u00e9minent, trop\nt\u00f4t disparu. Je pus appr\u00e9cier la haute et sereine intelligence\ndu professeur H. Sidgwick ; et me lier d'une amiti\u00e9 profonde\navec Fr\u00e9d. Myers.\nCelui-l\u00e0, vous l'avez tous connu. Vous ne trouverez donc\npas que j'exag\u00e8re si je dis que Fr\u00e9d. Myers a \u00e9t\u00e9 vraiment\npendant vingt ans l'\u00e2me de cette Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. C'est lui qui, par\nun heureux m\u00e9lange d'audace dans les th\u00e9ories, et de rigueur\ndans les m\u00e9thodes, servi par un esprit sagace et charmant, a\ninspir\u00e9 vos r\u00e9unions et men\u00e9 \u00e0 bien le travail consid\u00e9rable que\nla Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des recherches psychiques a pu effectuer.\nVoil\u00e0 pourquoi je ne puis me consid\u00e9rer comme un \u00e9tranger\nparmi vous ; car je fus, d\u00e8s les premiers jours, initi\u00e9 par Gurney\net Myers aux nobles efforts tent\u00e9s par eux pour faire rentrer\nles ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques dans le cadre des sciences r\u00e9guli\u00e8res\net pr\u00e9cises.\nMais le meilleur hommage qui se puisse rendre \u00e0 ces hommes\npour qui le travail \u00e9tait le premier devoir, c'est de suivre leur\nexemple et de travailler. Je vais donc inaugurer tout de suite\nmon r\u00f4le de pr\u00e9sident, en vous conviant au travail. Et alors,\npour que cette exhortation comporte une sorte de sanction, nous\njetterons un rapide coup d'\u0153il sur le pass\u00e9 : nous comparerons\nl'\u00e9tat actuel des sciences psychiques avec ce qu'elles \u00e9taient\nautrefois, et nous envisagerons ensemble quelles esp\u00e9rances nous\nsont permises et quels \u00e9cueils il faut \u00e9viter.\nII.\nNous ne remonterons pas au tr\u00e8s lointain pass\u00e9 : car dans\ntous les ouvrages on trouve d'abondants documents sur les\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes dits occultes, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 entrevus par les\nanciens et par les Orientaux. Ce sont travaux d'\u00e9rudition, dont\nl'int\u00e9r\u00eat, quoique assez vif, me para\u00eet secondaire. J'aime mieux\nprendre les choses au point o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient en 1875 environ,\nil y a trente ans. Vous verrez qu'en trente ann\u00e9es\u2014ce qui\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsychique. 5\nn'est absolument rien dans les histoires humaines\u2014un grand\npas a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nNous nous rendons compte assez mal de la marche des id\u00e9es.\nAutour de nous tout change, costumes, machines, langage m\u00eame,\net ces changements, qui sont graduels, passent inaper\u00e7us. Une\nfois qu'un progr\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9, il entre si vite dans les m\u0153urs\nque nous avons peine \u00e0 concevoir qu'il n'ait pas exist\u00e9 toujours.\nLes tr\u00e8s jeunes gens ne s'imaginent pas qu'il y a trente ans\non ne connaissait ni le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, ni le phonographe, ni les\nbicyclettes, ni les automobiles, ni les sleeping cars, ni les rayons\nX, ni l'antisepsie, ni la th\u00e9orie des microbes. Il leur para\u00eet\naujourd'hui que ces choses ont toujours exist\u00e9, qu'on n'a pas\npu vivre sans elles ; et pourtant\u2014j'en appelle aux souvenirs\nde jeunesse de tous les hommes de ma g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\u2014rien de\nsemblable n'existait il y a trente ans, et personne ne supposait\nque cela existerait un jour.\nEt, si l'on veut avoir une preuve bien d\u00e9monstrative de notre\nrapide \u00e9volution, qu'on compare les robes, les chapeaux, les\nth\u00e9\u00e2tres, les romans de 1875, \u00e0 ce que l'ann\u00e9e 1905 nous\ndonne en fait de robes, de chapeaux, de th\u00e9\u00e2tres et de romans.\nPas une dame n'oserait sortir avec un chapeau de la mode de\n1875; pas un auteur dramatique n'oserait faire une pi\u00e8ce\ncomme les pi\u00e8ces qui r\u00e9ussissaient en 1875. Quant aux romans\nde l'\u00e9poque, sauf quelques rares chefs d'\u0153uvre, ils n'ont plus\n\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent un seul lecteur. M\u00eame les ouvrages \u00e9crits pour les\nenfants sont de tout autre mod\u00e8le, et les enfants d'aujourd'hui\nrepoussent d\u00e9daigneusement les livres qui ont enchant\u00e9 notre\npremier \u00e2ge.\nDonc nous changeons, et nous changeons tr\u00e8s vite. Seule\nment ce changement se fait par une imperceptible s\u00e9rie de\ntransitions, de sorte qu'il passe inaper\u00e7u de nous.\nOr, dans les sciences psychiques, tout s'est profond\u00e9ment\nmodifi\u00e9, et, pour comprendre ces profondes modifications, il nous\nsuffira d'examiner quelle \u00e9tait, en fait de sciences psychiques,\nla mentalit\u00e9 des hommes de 1875.\nNi le somnambulisme, ni le magn\u00e9tisme animal, ni l'hypnotisme,\nni aucun des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes dits occultes n'\u00e9tait accept\u00e9; et m\u00eame\non ne se donnait pas la peine de les \u00e9tudier. On traitait toutes\nces \u00e9tudes par un sourire d'incr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 et de d\u00e9dain. Et\ncependant n'y avait-il pas pour le magn\u00e9tisme animal les\n\f6 M. Charles Richet. [part\nbeaux travaux de Deleuze, de Reichenbach, de Braid ? Mais\nil \u00e9tait plus simple de nier tout, en bloc, sans examen,\nsolemnellement, comme l'avait fait un m\u00e9decin \u00e9minent dans\nl'article \" Mesm\u00e9risme \" du Grand Dictionnaire encyclop\u00e9dique\ndes Sciences m\u00e9dicales, en 1875. \"En d\u00e9finitive\" disait-il pour\ntout r\u00e9sumer en un mot, \" le magn\u00e9tisme animal n'existe pas.\"\nEt, afin de mieux indiquer sa pens\u00e9e, il faisait imprimer\ncette phrase en gros caract\u00e8res, en lettres capitales, les plus\ngrosses de tout ce colossal dictionnaire, qui compte cent\nvolumes.\nLe spiritisme \u00e9tait plus maltrait\u00e9 encore, s'il est possible.\nNotre illustre et g\u00e9nial coll\u00e8gue, Sir William Crookes, avait\ncependant d\u00e9j\u00e0 publi\u00e9 ses extraordinaires exp\u00e9riences ; mais\nelles n'avaient provoqu\u00e9 aucune conviction. On les avait\nraill\u00e9es, avec plus ou moins d'esprit, mais sans m\u00eame se donner\nle soin de les r\u00e9futer. Les spirites d'ailleurs formaient une\ncaste \u00e0 part, repr\u00e9sentant en quelque sorte des adeptes d'une\nnouvelle religion. Ils s'entouraient de myst\u00e8res, exigeaient une\ninitiation, des pri\u00e8res. On ne pouvait faire partie des cercles\nspirites qu'apr\u00e8s avoir fait acte d'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 leurs principaux\ndogmes. Le fondement de la doctrine spirite \u00e9tait, en France\net sur le continent, la doctrine de la r\u00e9incarnation, propag\u00e9e\npar Allan Kardec, et les discussions sur les th\u00e9ories pr\u00e9occupaient\nplus que l'expos\u00e9 des faits. Ces faits, \u00e9pars, et mal racont\u00e9s,\n\u00e9taient presque exclusivement des histoires de tables tournantes.\nOr nous savons que, de toutes les exp\u00e9riences qu'on peut faire\nen mati\u00e8re de sciences occultes, celle des tables tournantes est\npeut-\u00eatre la plus d\u00e9cevante ; car elle exige des pr\u00e9cautions telles\nque bien rarement elle peut fournir quelque renseignement\ns\u00e9rieux.\nQuant aux mat\u00e9rialisations, aux apparitions, aux maisons\nhant\u00e9es, aux pr\u00e9monitions, aux apports, c\u00e0 et l\u00e0 dans les\njournaux spirites quelques r\u00e9cits \u00e9taient rapport\u00e9s, qui ne\npouvaient en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral inspirer aucune confiance ; car c'\u00e9taient,\nsauf exceptions, des histoires vagues, de seconde ou de troisi\u00e8me\nmain, et la na\u00efve cr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 des narrateurs provoquait, comme\nde juste, le scepticisme des lecteurs.\nEn tout cas, tout \u00e9tait \u00e9pars, sans lien, sans coh\u00e9sion. Selon\nl'occasion ou le temp\u00e9rament, il y avait des magn\u00e9tiseurs, des\nspirites, des hypnotiseurs, des m\u00e9diums clairvoyants, des\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsychique. 7\nm\u00e9diums \u00e0 mat\u00e9rialisations ; mais le groupement de tous\nces ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9 ; et la seule tentative\nde synth\u00e8se qu'on s'\u00e9tait hasard\u00e9 \u00e0 faire, c'\u00e9tait l'\u00e9vocation des\nesprits, sortes de Dei ex machina, suppl\u00e9ant \u00e0 tout par leur\nomnipotence, leur omniscience, et leur ubiquit\u00e9.\nAussi les doctrines et les faits psychiques \u00e9taient-ils \u00e9gale\nment repouss\u00e9s par les savants et par le vulgaire. On ne\ncomprenait m\u00eame pas qu'il f\u00fbt permis \u00e0 un homme s\u00e9rieux\nd'examiner si de tels faits \u00e9taient vrais ou non.\nVoil\u00e0 pourquoi, Mesdames et Messieurs, je professe une si\ngrande admiration pour notre illustre coll\u00e8gue, Sir William\nCrookes. Ce n'est pas seulement parce qu'il a d\u00e9couvert des\nm\u00e9taux nouveaux, invent\u00e9 des appareils admirables, source de\nf\u00e9condes d\u00e9couvertes, imagin\u00e9 des th\u00e9ories audacieuses dont\nchaque jour vient confirmer la profonde p\u00e9n\u00e9tration. C'est\npour autre chose encore que je l'admire ; c'est pour son\ncourage scientifique. Le courage du philosophe consiste \u00e0\nd\u00e9clarer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et \u00e0 braver pour elle la raillerie et le\nm\u00e9pris. Il me parait que ce courage l\u00e0\u2014le courage professionnel\ndu savant\u2014vaut bien la bravoure du soldat qui monte \u00e0\nl'assaut, sous la mitraille.\nQuand, en 1875, \u00e9tant alors tout jeune \u00e9tudiant, je me\nhasardai \u00e0 parler du somnambulisme, je d\u00e9butai par des\nparoles qui sembleraient bien ridicules maintenant : II faut\nun certain courage, disais-je alors, -pour prononcer le mot som\nnambulisme. De telles expressions ne se comprennent plus\naujourd'hui. Aujourd'hui nos jeunes \u00e9tudiants parlent couram\nment du magn\u00e9tisme animal, de la suggestion hypnotique, et\ndes autres ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de m\u00eame ordre, devenus classiques.\nM\u00eame ils sont parfois un peu ingrats envers leurs devanciers,\ncar ils ne peuvent pas se figurer \u00e0 quel discr\u00e9dit l'\u00e9tude de\nces ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes menait les hommes ayant la t\u00e9m\u00e9rit\u00e9 de\ns'aventurer dans ce champ maudit. Je me souviens encore\nque, lorsque je fis part de mes \u00e9tudes \u00e0 mon p\u00e8re, dont la\nhaute raison et la sagacit\u00e9 me guid\u00e8rent toujours, il les\nreconnut exactes. Mais, quand je lui dis que je les voulais\npublier, il m'en dissuada, me disant : \" Tu veux donc te\nperdre.\"\nHeureusement on ne se perd pas quand on d\u00e9fend ce qu'on\ncroit \u00eatre le vrai. Ce serait une \u00e9trange maladresse que\n\f8 M. Charles Richet. [part\nd'avoir d\u00e9couvert une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de ne pas oser la r\u00e9v\u00e9ler,\nsous pr\u00e9texte qu'elle sera contredite. Eh oui ! mille fois oui,\nelle sera contredite. Toutes les v\u00e9rit\u00e9s nouvelles ont com\nmenc\u00e9 par l\u00e0, presque sans exception. Et, si magnis liceat\ncomponere parva, je ne me suis pas plus perdu en affirmant\nla r\u00e9alit\u00e9 du somnambulisme provoqu\u00e9, que Sir William\nCrookes ne s'est perdu en affirmant l'existence des mat\u00e9\nrialisations.\nM\u00eame, puisque je parle ici de ce qu'on est convenu d'appeler\ncourage scientifique,\u2014ce qu'il vaudrait mieux d\u00e9nommer\ndevoir scientifique,\u2014on me permettra une courte digression.\nSouvent les spirites, dont la conviction, profonde comme celle\ndes ap\u00f4tres, n'est pas toujours appuy\u00e9e sur des preuves irr\u00e9\nfutables, nous reprochent de ne pas oser dire tout haut ce\nque nous pensons tout bas ; et de mettre une prudence\nexag\u00e9r\u00e9e, presque l\u00e2che, dans nos paroles ou nos \u00e9crits.\nNous aurions dans la main des tr\u00e9sors de choses vraies, et,\npar timidit\u00e9, nous n'oserions pas ouvrir la main pour laisser\ns'envoler de par le monde ces v\u00e9rit\u00e9s que nous d\u00e9tenons\njalousement. Il me para\u00eet que ce reproche est bien injuste.\nNous ne sommes encore ni les uns, ni les autres, parvenus \u00e0\nce degr\u00e9 d'ineptie. Quoi ! voici une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 dont je suis abso\nlument certain, et que, par je ne sais quelles enfantines\ncraintes, je n'oserais pas \u00e9noncer ! Serions-nous assez sots pour\nne pas \u00eatre s\u00fbrs qu'une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 finira toujours t\u00f4t ou tard par\nappara\u00eetre au grand jour et faire irruption parmi les hommes ?\nVraiment non ! Si nous h\u00e9sitons \u00e0 raconter tel ou tel fait,\n\u00e0 publier telle ou telle exp\u00e9rience, c'est qu'il nous reste encore\ndes doutes. Car, si notre certitude \u00e9tait compl\u00e8te, nous n'h\u00e9si\nterions pas \u00e0 parler urbi et orbi. Quel pauvre calcul que de\nne pas oser dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, sous pr\u00e9texte qu'elle va soulever\ndes appr\u00e9ciations hostiles ! C'est un peu de cette mani\u00e8re\nna\u00efve et sotte que proc\u00e8dent certains gouvernements, quand\nils ont re\u00e7u la nouvelle d'une d\u00e9faite militaire ; ils n'osent\npas la communiquer \u00e0 la presse, et publient des bulletins\nmensongers. Cependant ils doivent bien savoir qu'un jour\nou l'autre la d\u00e9faite sera connue dans tous ses d\u00e9tails.\nSi parfois on h\u00e9site \u00e0 raconter des faits dont on a \u00e9t\u00e9\nt\u00e9moin, ce n'est pas seulement parce qu'un doute subsiste,\nc'est aussi parce qu'il ne suffit pas d'avoir observ\u00e9 un fait\n\fL.] La M&apsychique. 9\npour le publier. La science n'est pas le re\"cit d'un fait,\nni meme le re\"cit de plusieurs faits. Elle est plus compli-\nque\"e qu'une serie d'histoires entasse\"es 1'une apres 1'autre. Elle\ndemande que ces faits e\"pars soient plus ou moins coordonnes ;\navec des preuves, des demonstrations, et des repetitions qui les\neclaircissent. Comme on a 1'espoir de faire sortir les sciences\npsychiques de la pe\"riode empirique pour les faire entrer dans\nla periode experimentale, on attend que 1'experimentation ait\ncomplete, et plus ou moins elucide, un fait empirique isole\" ; et\nsouvent on est force d'attendre longtemps. Experientia fallax,\njudicium difficile, disait deja Hippocrate.\nEn outre il est parfois certaines preuves morales, qui sont\ndecisives pour nous, mais qui ne peuvent etre considerees\ncomme telles par le public. On pourrait citer bien de curieuses\nhistoires, tres instructives, mais qui n'ont que notre conviction\npersonnelle pour preuve de leur valeur scientifique. Elles n'ont\ndone pas droit d'admission dans la science, et j'estime que pro-\nvisoirement il vaut mieux ne pas les publier. Ce n'est pas\npar defaut de courage, ce n'est pas par deference pour 1'opinion\npublique, c'est par respect d'une critique scieutifique tres legi-\ntime. J'avoue me'me que, si un excellent observateur venait\nme citer certains faits singuliers, etablis uniquement sur sa\nconviction intime, j'aurais peine a y ajouter foi, et je sup-\nposerais quelque defectuosite dans 1'observatiou, ou quelque\ntromperie habile dans la production du phenomene.\nAlors a quoi bon publier une experience dont la realite,\nquelque certaiue qu'elle soit pour nous, ne peut e'tre demon-\ntree ?\nRevenons maintenant a 1'annee 1875, et aux progres de\n1'opinion en matiere psychique.\nCes progres ont ete considerables : et, au risque de passer\npour un flatteur, je dirai que c'est a vous qu'ils sont dus.\nC'est votre Societe qui, dirigee par vos illustres presidents,\nque ce soit Fred. Myers, ou H. Sidgwick, ou M. Arthur Balfour,\nou M. Barrett, ou Sir O. Lodge, car tous ont eu part h vos\ntravaux, a ose initier un public sceptique k des faits etranges\net troublants. Le public put se rendre compte qu'on pouvait\netre, vis a vis des faits psychiques, aussi exigeant en demonstra\ntions que pour les autres faits scientifiques, de chimie, de\nphysiologic, d'astronomie.

[part\npens\u00e9 qu'il fallait \u00eatre plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re encore que ne sont d'ordi\nnaire les chimistes ou les physiologistes dans leurs d\u00e9monstra\ntions ; car, plus la chose \u00e0 \u00e9tablir est extraordinaire, d\u00e9passant\nles pr\u00e9visions normales, plus les preuves doivent \u00eatre rigou\nreuses. Et alors, dans votre Journal et dans vos Proceedings,\nparurent des r\u00e9cits contr\u00f4l\u00e9s exactement, toujours soumis \u00e0 une\ncritique p\u00e9n\u00e9trante, desquels on pouvait tirer cette conclusion\n\u2022certaine que des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes inexpliqu\u00e9s se produisent, divers,\nmultiples, prot\u00e9iformes, d\u00e9pendant probablement de causes\n.diverses, mais cependant ayant ce caract\u00e8re commun de n'\u00eatre\npas explicables par les explications simplistes, qu'essayent de\nnous donner les sciences officielles classiques.\nParall\u00e8lement \u00e0 votre effort, sur le continent, en France et\n\u2022en Italie surtout, on poursuivait m\u00e9thodiquement l'\u00e9tude des\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes semblables. Aksakoff, Ochorowicz, de Rochas, Lom-\nbroso, J. Maxwell, et bien d'autres, s'appliquaient \u00e0 donner\n.de la pr\u00e9cision aux exp\u00e9riences.

Pour grand que soit\nle labeur, il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 ce point que les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psy\nchiques sont entr\u00e9s d\u00e9finitivement dans la science. Nous serions\nbien imprudents de le croire. Mais nous sommes au moins\narriv\u00e9s \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat, qui est de premi\u00e8re importance, qu'aujour\nd'hui on a le droit d'\u00e9tudier ces questions sans \u00eatre accus\u00e9\n\u2022d'ali\u00e9nation mentale.

Nous avons des centaines de Trait\u00e9s, excellents\nd'ailleurs, pour la chimie, la physiologie, la physique, l'alg\u00e8bre,\nl'astronomie, la psychologie m\u00eame. N'est-il pas d\u00e9sirable que,\nprofitant des richesses \u00e9parses, patiemment amass\u00e9es de toutes\nparts, quelque penseur ing\u00e9nieux et sagace se d\u00e9voue \u00e0 les\ncolliger, s\u00e9parant le bon grain de l'ivraie, laissant r\u00e9solument\nde c\u00f4t\u00e9 ce que est douteux et incomplet pour ne prendre que\nles faits d\u00fbment et solidement constat\u00e9s ?\nJe ne pr\u00e9tends pas que l'auteur doive remplacer, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il\ny a doute, les faits incertains par des affirmations : ni proposer\ncomme parfaites des th\u00e9ories incompl\u00e8tes. Je dis seulement\nqu'en 1905, apr\u00e8s les innombrables r\u00e9cits accumul\u00e9s depuis\ntrente ans sur les sciences psychiques, les mat\u00e9riaux d'un grand\nouvrage sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s. Et j'ajoute que l'heure de ce livre\nest venue. Les temps sont murs, pour ce grand Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire\net rationnel des sciences occultes.\nMais, en pronon\u00e7ant ce mot, je m'aper\u00e7ois qu'il faut donner\nun nom \u00e0 cette nouvelle science. Ne l'appelons pas science\nocculte ; car toutes les sciences \u00e0 leur d\u00e9but sont occultes ; elles\ncessent de l'\u00eatre lorsque elles sont moins incertaines. L'astrologie\na cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre une science occulte lorsqu'elle s'est transform\u00e9e\nen astronomie ; l'alchimie, quand elle s'est transmut\u00e9e en chimie.\nJe ne trouve pas que le mot de sciences psychiques soit tr\u00e8s\nheureux ; car il est bon nombre de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes pour lesquels\nl'explication par la ^xy est insuffisante. Par exemple qu'y\na-t-il de psychique dans les bruits qui se font entendre en une\nmaison hant\u00e9e ? Il vaut mieux employer un mot qui ne constitue\npas d\u00e9j\u00e0 en lui-m\u00eame une hypoth\u00e8se, et une hypoth\u00e8se manifeste\nment insuffisante. En outre la psychologie classique est l'\u00e9tude\nde l'\u00e2me humaine et de l'intelligence. Elle aurait droit, elle\nt\u00eate des divers m\u00e9moires ou des r\u00e9cits qui seront donn\u00e9s, soit dans nos\nProceedings, soit dans le Journal, soit dans un recueil scientifique quelconque,\nces indications d\u00e9cimales ; car, en les classant par fiches, on aura ainsi une\nexcellente bibliographie, qui, si l'on prend soin de se tenir au courant des\nchoses publi\u00e9es, sera rapidement abondante.\nMais je ne puis qu'effleurer le sujet ; j'esp\u00e8re pouvoir lui donner prochaine\nment toute l'extension qu'il m\u00e9rite.\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsychique. 13\naussi, au titre de science psychique ; et cependant elle ne fait\npas partie du cercle de nos \u00e9tudes. Elle a son histoire, ses\ntrait\u00e9s didactiques, ses professeurs, son enseignement, \u00e0 ce point\nqu'on l'enseigne m\u00eame dans les gymnases.\nRepoussons aussi le mot de sciences spiritiqxws, plus mauvais\npeut-\u00eatre encore que les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ; car l'hypoth\u00e8se des esprits,\nmalgr\u00e9 sa simplicit\u00e9 un peu na\u00efve, et la grande vogue qu'elle\na acquise \u00e0 l'heure pr\u00e9sente, n'est pas, dans l'ensemble, recevable.\nAlors je vous proposerai une expression nouvelle\u2014avec quelque\ntimidit\u00e9, comme il convient quand on se hasarde \u00e0 un n\u00e9ologisme\u2014\nc'est celle de sciences m\u00e9tapsychiqv.es.\nVous savez tous quelle extraordinaire fortune a eue le\nmot m\u00e9taphysique. Il s'agissait, dans l'\u0153uvre d'Aristote, de\nd\u00e9nommer les chapitres qui suivaient les chapitres consacr\u00e9s\naux sciences physiques, et alors, tout naturellement ils furent\nappel\u00e9s chapitres m\u00e9taphysiques, c'est \u00e0 dire suivant les chapitres\nde physique. De m\u00eame, semble-t-il, nous pourrions \u00e0 cette\nscience nouvelle, dont nous pr\u00e9voyons le rapide essor, dont\nnous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 les premiers lin\u00e9aments fragmentaires, donner\nle nom, en somme assez simple, de m\u00e9tapsychique (fiera Ta\n.^fvj^iKa). Evidemment, si cette m\u00e9tapsychique n'existait pas,\nil serait absurde de cr\u00e9er un mot nouveau pour une erreur.\nMais je ne crois pas, malgr\u00e9 toutes les cr\u00e9dulit\u00e9s aveugles\nqui ont compromis cette science, qu'il soit possible de nier\ntous les faits. Et la meilleure preuve que je puisse donner\nde ma conviction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que je\npropose un mot, le mot de m\u00e9tapsychique, pour les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes\nqu'elle est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir.1\nSi donc vous acceptez, au moins provisoirement, le mot\nde Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9tapsychique, pour ce livre que nous esp\u00e9rons,\n1 Ces lignes \u00e9taient \u00e9crites quand j'ai appris que le mot de m\u00e9tapsychique\n\u00e9tait moins nouveau que je ne le croyais. A l'issue de l'adresse que je\npr\u00e9sentai \u00e0 la S. P.R. le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1905, M. Wincenty Lutoslawski vint\nnie trouver et m'annoncer, \u00e0 ma tr\u00e8s grande surprise, qu'il avait appliqu\u00e9\nle mot de m\u00e9tapsychique \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re. En effet,\ndans un de ses ouvrages ( Wyklady Sagiellonskie, t. IL, 1902, Krakow, XXIII.)\nse trouve cette phrase (qu'on traduit du polonais) : \"Je nomme m\u00e9tapsychique\ncette partie des recherches psychologiques qui traite des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes anor\nmaux de la conscience individuelle, ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes \u00e9tudi\u00e9s r\u00e9cemment, surtout\npar la Soc. for Psychical Research.\" Mais, comme on voit, j'ai donn\u00e9 une\nbien plus grande extension au mot M\u00e9tapsychique, en comprenant sous ce\nterme tout ce qu'on appelait jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent sciences occultes.\n\f14 M. Cluirles Richet. [part\nnous allons examiner quels en seraient les principaux chapitres,\net comment on pourrait le concevoir. Cet expos\u00e9 va nous\ndonner l'occasion de pr\u00e9ciser quelles sont les limites de cette\nscience, ou plus exactement quel est pour elle le vaste champ\n\u00e0 parcourir, presque sans limites.\nIII.\nVous m'excuserez des d\u00e9tails techniques, parfois un peu\narides, dans lesquels je serai forc\u00e9 d'entrer. Mais je crois que\nnotre devoir strict est d'aborder s\u00e9rieusement les choses\ns\u00e9rieuses, et de faire, de la science qui nous occupe, autre\nchose qu'un divertissement litt\u00e9raire.\nTout d'abord il y aura dans la m\u00e9tapsychique deux parties\nbien distinctes, encore que sur les confins, comme toujours, elles\nse confondent; \u00e0 savoir les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes purement psychiques,\net les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes exclusivement mat\u00e9riels.\nSont ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes purement psychiques ceux dans lesquels il\nne se d\u00e9c\u00e8le aucune mouvement, aucune vibration de la mati\u00e8re.\nAinsi une pr\u00e9monition, un fait de t\u00e9l\u00e9pathie, une suggestion\nmentale, ne supposent pas l'existence d'une force agissant sur\nla mati\u00e8re, tandis qu'un apport, des raps, une mat\u00e9rialisation,\nsupposent de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'alors la mati\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 mue et\nactionn\u00e9e par une force autre que les forces psychologiques\nattribu\u00e9es \u00e0 notre \u00eatre. Dans les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques il\nn'y a aucune objectivit\u00e9. Tout se passe en mouvements de\nl'\u00e2me, en sentiments, perceptions, \u00e9motions, tandis que, dans les\nphenom\u00e8nes mat\u00e9riels, l'objectivit\u00e9 est compl\u00e8te.\nAu premier abord il semble que la distinction soit absolue.\nNullement. Elle est tr\u00e8s malais\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir dans bon nombre\nde cas.\nPar exemple, voici une pr\u00e9monition donn\u00e9e par des raps.\nLes raps sont ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne mat\u00e9riel ; et je suppose que, dans\nle cas actuel, ces raps aient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus sans contact. Au\ncontraire la pr\u00e9monition est ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne psychique. Iaudra-t-il\nclasser cette observation dans l'un ou l'autre groupe ?\nDe pareilles difficult\u00e9s se pr\u00e9sentent dans toutes les sciences ;\net il ne faut jamais concevoir nos classifications que comme\ndes proc\u00e9d\u00e9s analytiques, commodes pour l'enseignement et\nl'\u00e9tude, mais ne r\u00e9pondant pas \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9 des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes.\n\fL-] La M\u00e9tap&ychique. 15\nUn ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne, lorsqu'il se produit, ne se pr\u00e9occupe pas de\nsavoir s'il va rentrer dans la physique, ou la chimie, ou la\npsychologie, ou la m\u00e9canique. C'est un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne, voil\u00e0 tout ;\net cela lui suffit. Mais pour la facilit\u00e9 de l'exposition nous le\nfaisons rentrer dans les cadres plus ou moins artificiels que\nnous avons \u00e9tablis ; et nous devons nous r\u00e9signer d'avance \u00e0\nconsid\u00e9rer notre classification comme inad\u00e9quate \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9\ndes choses.\nPour en revenir \u00e0 l'exemple cit\u00e9, nous dirons que, dans\ncette pr\u00e9monition par raps, il y a un double aspect au ph\u00e9\nnom\u00e8ne ; 1\u00b0, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 m\u00e9canique, mat\u00e9riel (vibrations de la\ntable) ; 2\u00b0, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 psychique, intellectuel (pr\u00e9monition). L'\u00e9tude\ndes raps doit \u00eatre faite \u00e0 part, comme celle de tous les ph\u00e9\nnom\u00e8nes mat\u00e9riels, en tant que ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes mat\u00e9riels. Mais un\nchapitre sp\u00e9cial dans l'\u00e9tude des raps doit \u00eatre consacr\u00e9 aux\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques, intelligents, qui se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent par le\nmoyen des raps, et qui par cons\u00e9quent leur donnent une signi\nfication psychologique.\nPrenons une comparaison qui rendra plus claire cette disso\nciation d'un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne unique en apparence. Voici un\nmessage t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu'on se propose d'\u00e9tudier compl\u00e8tement.\nIl faudra donc faire deux \u00e9tudes s\u00e9par\u00e9es ; d'abord analyser\ntout ce qui est la m\u00e9canique m\u00eame de la transmission ;\nl'appareil r\u00e9cepteur, les fils conducteurs, la vibration des plaques\nt\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, etc. Ce sera l'\u00e9tude physique du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.\nL'\u00e9tude psychologique viendra en second lieu. Il faudra alors\nexaminer ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans le message m\u00eame, la port\u00e9e et\nla signification des paroles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9es. Et il\nparait bien qu'une distinction compl\u00e8te entre l'acte m\u00e9canique\nproduit, et la signification intellectuelle, morale, de cet acte est\nfacile \u00e0 instituer.\nDans d'autres conditions encore les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques\net mat\u00e9riels sont en partie confondus. Un fait de t\u00e9l\u00e9pathie\nest le plus souvent exclusivement subjectif. Toutefois, dans\nquelques tr\u00e8s rares r\u00e9cits, il est dit que la mort d'une personne\n\u00e9loign\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs personnes \u00e0 la fois, par\nune apparition ayant tous les caract\u00e8res de l'objectivit\u00e9, de\nsorte qu'il n'est gu\u00e8re possible alors de dire que le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne\na \u00e9t\u00e9 seulement psychique.\nOn pourrait multiplier les exemples, et je crois bien que\n\f16 M. Charles Richet. [part\nl'incertitude grandira \u00e0 mesure qu'on approfondira l'\u00e9tude de\nces choses. Mais, au fond je ne crois pas que la difficult\u00e9 soit\ninsurmontable ; et je persiste \u00e0 penser que ces deux grands\nchapitres fondamentaux de la m\u00e9tapsychique peuvent \u00eatre con\nserv\u00e9s (A) ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes mat\u00e9riels. (B) ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes non\nmat\u00e9riels.\nMaintenant vous m'excuserez si, passant en revue les uns\net les autres, je fais une excursion rapide dans le vaste do\nmaine de la science qui nous int\u00e9resse. Je serai forc\u00e9ment tr\u00e8s\nincomplet ; et je ne pourrai donner qu'un r\u00e9sum\u00e9, tr\u00e8s som\nmaire. Mais m\u00eame ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9, trop bref, nous permettra de fixer\nl'\u00e9tat de la M\u00e9tapsychique aujourd'hui, en 1905. Je m'imagine\nque, dans quelques lustres, nos petits neveux le liront avec\nquelque curiosit\u00e9, pour rire de notre ignorance, et s'\u00e9tonner\nde nos \u00e9tonnements.\nEn tout cas\u2014et je tiens \u00e0 ce qu'il n'y ait sur ce point\naucune m\u00e9prise\u2014le fait de mentionner tels ou tels ordres\nde ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, et de les faire rentrer dans un cadre commode\n\u00e0 un expos\u00e9 didactique, n'implique nullement que je croie \u00e0\nleur r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Je n'en parle que pour tenter une classification\nd'ensemble, et nullement pour affirmer leur existence. D'ail\nleurs les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes que je vais tenter de classifier sont, pour\nla plupart, plus surprenants que d\u00e9montr\u00e9s. Et, si je me\nhasarde ainsi \u00e0 parcourir ce vaste domaine de la science\nm\u00e9tapsychique, c'est que nulle part peut \u00eatre, elle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9,\nm\u00eame en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, trait\u00e9e dans son ensemble, comme je vais\nt\u00e9m\u00e9rairement essayer de la faire devant vous.\nIV.\nCe qui caract\u00e9rise les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes mat\u00e9riels, c'est qu'alors\ndes forces physiques naturelles sont mises en jeu ; lumi\u00e8re,\nmouvement, vibrations sonores, forces qu'on ne peut expliquer\npar une \u00e9motion de la conscience: car il se produit alors \u00e9videm\nment un d\u00e9gagement de force mat\u00e9rielle qui s'ext\u00e9riorise, qui\npeut \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e par un appareil, et dont la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 peut\n\u00eatre constat\u00e9e par des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s rigoureux de contr\u00f4le.\nA priori on peut admettre que ce d\u00e9gagement de force n'a\nrien d'invraisemblable ; car les forces de la nature, connues de\nnous, ne sont rien \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des forces inconnues. Nous pouvons,\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsychique. 17\net m\u00eame nous devons faire ce dilemme tr\u00e8s \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Ou\nnous connaissons toutes les forces de la nature: ou nous ne\nles connaissons pas toutes. Or l'hypoth\u00e8se que toutes les forces\nde la nature nous sont connues est tellement absurde qu'il\nsuffit de l'\u00e9noncer pour en \u00e9tablir l'absurdit\u00e9. Ce qui est\ninvraisemblable, et radicalement invraisemblable, c'est que nulle\nforce physique n'\u00e9chappe \u00e0 nos sens, et qu'il n'existe pas de\nvibration que nos ch\u00e9tives sensations ne nous aient jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9\nsent r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e.\nDonc l'existence de forces inconnues agissant sur la mati\u00e8re\nest possible, vraisemblable, rationnelle. Mais le probl\u00e8me qui\nse pose n'est pas de savoir si ces forces sont possibles et vrai\nsemblables ; car la question est jug\u00e9e, et bien jug\u00e9e. Il s'agit\nde les constater et de les d\u00e9montrer d'une mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9futable.\nLa t\u00e2che para\u00eet d'abord facile. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9 elle est d'une\ndifficult\u00e9 extr\u00eame.\nPrenons pour exemple le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne mat\u00e9riel le plus simple ;\nla vibration d'une table sans contact. Il semble que ce soit l\u00e0\nvraiment le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne m\u00e9canique \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Un grand\nnombre d'observateurs, et de bons observateurs, affirment avoir\n\u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moins de ce fait. Combien cependant cette affirmation\ntrouve-t-elle de contradicteurs ? On oppose la supercherie,\nl'obscurit\u00e9, le d\u00e9faut d'attention, les mouvements musculaires\ninconscients, les craquements du bois, dus \u00e0 l'humidit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la\nchaleur ; les d\u00e9placements des tendons (Schiff), et autres all\u00e9\ngations qui sont aussi invraisemblables que le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne\nlui-m\u00eame. Pourtant il y a eu, dans d'innombrables s\u00e9ances\nm\u00e9tapsychiques, raps, ou d\u00e9placements d'objets, ou mouvements\nde la table. Cela ne para\u00eet gu\u00e8re douteux. M\u00eame si, en\nexag\u00e9rant quelque peu les scrupules de la rigueur scientifique,\non \u00e9limine les cas, authentiques cependant, o\u00f9 les s\u00e9ances\nont eu lieu dans l'obscurit\u00e9, il restera encore un bon nombre\nde s\u00e9ances, tenues en demi-lumi\u00e8re, ou en pleine lumi\u00e8re, pen\ndant lesquelles on a entendu des vibrations dans le bois d'une\ntable que personne ne touchait, vibrations que le hasard et\nl'humidit\u00e9 n'ont pas pu produire.\nSi je n'avais pas pris le parti de fester aujourd'hui dans des\ng\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s, je pourrais vous rapporter \u00e0 ce sujet d'assez nom\nbreuses exp\u00e9riences personnelles. Peut-\u00eatre, quelque jour, si vous\nle permettez, aurai-je l'occasion de vous faire le r\u00e9cit de mon\nB\n\f18 M. Charles Richet. [part\nexp\u00e9rimentation sur les raps : mais de tels protocoles d'exp\u00e9ri\nences ne valent que par le d\u00e9tail ; et les d\u00e9tails \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper\nsont si abondants que leur expos\u00e9 m\u00e9thodique me m\u00e8nerait beau\ncoup trop loin. Je me contenterai donc de vous dire que,\nselon moi, le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne des raps sans contact, toute r\u00e9serve\nfaite quant \u00e0 leur cause, me para\u00eet un fait certain.\nIl est d'autant plus important \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, ce fait, que mille faits\nn\u00e9gatifs ne prouvent rien contre un seul fait positif. Supposons\nqu'une seule fois, en des conditions reconnues irr\u00e9prochables,\nil y a eu vibrations (intelligentes) dans une table, que personne\nne touchait et ne pouvait toucher, c'est assez pour que le fait\nexiste, d\u00e9fiant toute critique, et inattaquable. Cent mille\nexp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives ne prouveront rien contre ce fait unique,\ns'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment \u00e9tabli. Or vraiment, si nous voulions analyser\nce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit \u00e0 ce sujet depuis les exp\u00e9riences de Sir\nWilliam Crookes jusqu'\u00e0 celles de J. Maxwell, pendant trente\nans, dans les livres et journaux de sciences m\u00e9tapsychiques, nous\nne serions pas embarrass\u00e9s pour trouver trente ou quarante\ncas de raps bien nettement per\u00e7us par tous les assistants, en\npleine lumi\u00e8re, sans contact avec la table. Probablement, dans\ncette r\u00e9union, il ne se trouve pas un seul auditeur, ayant assist\u00e9\n\u00e0 quelques s\u00e9ances, qui n'ait eu l'occasion, au moins une fois\ndans sa vie, de constater dans de bonnes conditions ce ph\u00e9no\nm\u00e8ne, et d'\u00eatre convaincu de sa r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nSi ces sortes de vibrations mol\u00e9culaires des corps n'ont\npas pris rang encore dans la science classique, c'est que la\nscience classique est, \u00e0 juste raison, tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8re, tr\u00e8s exigeante\nen fait de preuves. On ne peut la bl\u00e2mer de cet exc\u00e8s de\ns\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Mais, ce qui est moins \u00e0 son honneur, c'est qu'elle\ns'est content\u00e9e de juger\u2014et de nier\u2014sans exp\u00e9rimenter s\u00e9rieuse\nment, de telle sorte qu'elle n'est gu\u00e8re qualifi\u00e9e pour appr\u00e9cier\ndes faits qu'elle n'a point voulu \u00e9tudier.\nAu fond cette h\u00e9sitation de la science ne doit pas nous\nsurprendre ; car il faut pour l'\u00e9tude de pareils ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes un\npeu plus qu'une patience ordinaire; un peu plus m\u00eame que\nla patience du savant, qui est proverbiale. Tout d'abord on\ndoit se d\u00e9gager des anciens pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, se contenter, au d\u00e9but,\nd'exp\u00e9riences mal faites, incertaines, que l'on peut graduelle\nment rendre moins fautives, mais qui aux commencements se\nproduisent dans des conditions absolument d\u00e9fectueuses. Et\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsychique. 19\nalors il faut que le savant d\u00e9pouille le vieil homme, comme\non dit, se contente d'exp\u00e9riences impr\u00e9cises, au d\u00e9but, avec\nla ferme volont\u00e9 de les rendre peu \u00e0 peu de plus en plus\nrigoureuses ; de sorte que, pour mener \u00e0 bien cette progres\nsion, ce n'est pas moins de quinze s\u00e9ances, au bas mot, qui\nseront n\u00e9cessaires. Mais combien sont-ils, les m\u00e9decins,\nchimistes, math\u00e9maticiens, ing\u00e9nieurs, qui ont pendant quinze\ns\u00e9ances exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 avec un vrai m\u00e9dium, reconnu comme\ntel, et qui ont formul\u00e9, \u00e0 la fin, une conclusion d\u00e9favorable ?\nS'ils ont eu le courage d'entreprendre ces exp\u00e9riences, ils n'ont\npas eu le courage, apr\u00e8s quelques \u00e9checs, de continuer : et\nleur patience a \u00e9t\u00e9 bient\u00f4t lass\u00e9e.\nQuelques uns cependant ont poursuivi, sans se laisser\nrebuter, et alors, il faut bien le reconna\u00eetre, ils ont fini par\n\u00eatre convaincus. L'histoire de la m\u00e9tapsychique est pleine\nde conversions de ce genre. Seulement ces conversions ne\nse produisent pas brusquement. Ce n'est pas la lueur ful\ngurante qui, en quelques secondes, \u00e9blouit pour toujours\nl'ap\u00f4tre Paul sur le chemin de Damas. C'est une lente et\nprogressive conqu\u00eate, disput\u00e9e aux doutes, aux retours en\narri\u00e8re, aux angoisses, aux d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s exp\u00e9rimentales, aux\nsuspicions peut-\u00eatre. Je puis en parler par ma propre exp\u00e9\nrience. Cette route n'est pas un sentier de fleurs. Elle est\nsem\u00e9e de pierres, et de ronces ; et, quand on l'a parcourue, on\nregrette parfois de s'y \u00eatre engag\u00e9, de ne pas avoir pris le\nparti, plus sage et plus l\u00e2che, d'accepter l'opinion commune,\net de sommeiller dans la cr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 na\u00efve et aveugle des\nspirites, ou dans le d\u00e9dain solennel et n\u00e9gateur des savants,\nou dans l'indiff\u00e9rence satisfaite et apathique de l'immense ma\njorit\u00e9 du troupeau humain.\nRevenons aux ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes mat\u00e9riels : et concluons qu'ils\nexistent. Il n'y a pas l\u00e0 de quoi mettre en p\u00e9ril la science\ncontemporaine. D\u00e9j\u00e0 un premier caract\u00e8re diff\u00e9rencie ces\nforces mat\u00e9rielles m\u00e9tapsychiques des autres forces mat\u00e9\nrielles connues. Elles sont intelligentes. Et alors tout de\nsuite appara\u00eet un redoutable probl\u00e8me. Sont-elles humaines\nou extra-humaines ?\nPour ma part, je l'avoue sans crainte, je ne vois \u00e0 priori\naucun motif scientifique pour repousser l'intervention d,'\u00eatres\nintelligents, autres que l'homme. L'hypoth\u00e8se de puissances\n\f20 M. Charles Richet. [part\nintellectuelles, \u00e9voluant autour de nous, dans cette immensit\u00e9\nmyst\u00e9rieuse de la nature, n'est ni invraisemblable, ni impos\nsible. Mais ce n'est pas sur ce terrain de la possibilit\u00e9\nou de la vraisemblance qu'il faut placer la discussion.\nL'hypoth\u00e8se est possible, assur\u00e9ment: il s'agit de savoir si elle\nest n\u00e9cessaire.\nOr jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 ne me para\u00eet pas \u00e9vidente :\ncar les limites de l'intelligence humaine, et des forces mat\u00e9rielles\nou psychiques qu'elle d\u00e9gage, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9es encore. Plus\non approfondit la conscience, plus on y d\u00e9couvre des couches\nprofondes, inconnues de nous-m\u00eames ; des consciences sublimi\nnales, des personnalit\u00e9s secondes; se superposant, se succ\u00e9dant,\ntour \u00e0 tour, et prenant les apparences de personnalit\u00e9s r\u00e9elles,\nbien distinctes de notre moi.\nEt qui sait ce que peut produire la vibration nerveuse ?\nElle produit de la chaleur et de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Elle provoque des\nactions chimiques. Elle donne une forme mat\u00e9rielle \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e.\nPourquoi n'agirait-elle pas sur les objets inertes ? On pourrait\nfournir \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard bien des arguments, favorables ou contraires ;\nmais il ne me semble pas sage d'aborder cette discussion.\nIl ne para\u00eet pas que les temps soient murs encore. A\\ant\nde faire la th\u00e9orie d'un fait, il faut d\u00e9terminer le fait lui-\nm\u00eame, et nous serons fid\u00e8les \u00e0 la vraie m\u00e9thode exp\u00e9rimentale,\nen recherchant les conditions d'un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne, avant de dis\nserter sur sa cause m\u00eame.\nD'autant plus que le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne lui-m\u00eame est bien loin\nd'\u00eatre accept\u00e9 universellement et reconnu par tous comme\nauthentique. Alors \u00e0 quoi bon nous perdre dans les nuages de\nla th\u00e9orie ? Etablissons solidement la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des faits, et nous\npouvons \u00eatre certains que la th\u00e9orie en sera donn\u00e9e un jour.\nJe me suis \u00e9tendu sur le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne des raps : car c'est le\nplus simple des faits mat\u00e9riels de la m\u00e9tapsychique ; mais il en\nest d'autres encore, nombreux et vari\u00e9s, plus compliqu\u00e9s\nd'ailleurs, dont il convient de faire mention.\n1\u00b0. Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes m\u00e9caniques autres que les raps.\n2\u00b0. Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes lumineux.\n3\u00b0. Transports d'objets \u00e0 distance ou apports.\n4\u00b0. Autres ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes objectifs.\n1\u00b0. Les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes m\u00e9caniques autres que les raps sont tr\u00e8s\nvari\u00e9s: et on peut les classer en plusieurs cat\u00e9gories.\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsychique. 21\n(A) D\u00e9placements d'objets.\nDe ces d\u00e9placements d'objets le plus simple para\u00eet \u00eatre celui\nde la table tournante. Des volumes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crits sur ce sujet.\nMais toute cette litt\u00e9rature ne me semble pas tr\u00e8s d\u00e9monstra\ntive; car, dans la plupart de ces exp\u00e9riences, les mains\ntouchaient la table. Or personne de vous n'ignore que des\nmouvements musculaires inconscients, chez des personnes de\ntr\u00e8s bonne foi, peuvent produire des d\u00e9placements mat\u00e9riels\nconsid\u00e9rables.\nPourtant il y a eu souvent des soul\u00e8vements complets de la\ntable sans contact, ou des mouvements de la table sans\ncontact. On pourrait faire de tr\u00e8s probantes citations de\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de ce genre ; mais ce serait abuser de votre\npatience que d'en entreprendre r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, m\u00eame incompl\u00e8te.\nCe ne sont pas seulement les tables qui peuvent se mouvoir.\nD'autres objets peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9s, tant\u00f4t plus petits, tant\u00f4t\nm\u00eame plus volumineux quune table. De sorte que, tout bien\nconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, l'ext\u00e9riorisation du mouvement, suivant l'expression\nheureuse de mon ami A. de Rochas, para\u00eet bien \u00eatre un\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne r\u00e9el, et d\u00fbment constat\u00e9.\nCependant ne nous f\u00e9licitons pas trop. Ce fait n'est pas\nencore reconnu par la science officielle ; et des mesures pr\u00e9\ncises n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises encore. M\u00eame, h\u00e9las ! quand on a\nvoulu l'enregistrer dans des conditions rigoureuses de contr\u00f4le,\ndes difficult\u00e9s se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, toujours renaissantes. Chaque\nnouvel appareil scientifique a sembl\u00e9 arr\u00eater le d\u00e9veloppement\ndes ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes. Les instruments m\u00e9thodiques ont plus ou\nmoins \u00e9chou\u00e9, de sorte que les exp\u00e9rimentateurs futurs ont\nencore beaucoup \u00e0 faire. Il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer les conditions\nde ces mouvements \u00e0 distance. Je dirais m\u00eame, au risque\nde vous para\u00eetre quelque peu sceptique, qu'il s'agit d'en\ndonner une d\u00e9monstration plus rigoureuse que toutes celles\nqui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es jusqu'ici.\nOn voit tout de suite combien nous voil\u00e0 loin de l'hypo\nth\u00e8se spirite. Car, s'il \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9 qu'il y a attraction ou\nr\u00e9pulsion des objets mat\u00e9riels par des forces \u00e9manant d'un\nm\u00e9dium, ce ne serait pas du tout une preuve qu'on puisse\nall\u00e9guer en faveur de l'existence des esprits.\nA vrai dire, pour \u00eatre \u00e9quitable, il faut reconna\u00eetre que ces\n\f22 M. Charles Richet. [part\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes kin\u00e9tiques sont bien plus marqu\u00e9s quand on\nadmet, dans une s\u00e9ance, l'hypoth\u00e8se spirite. Tout se passe\ncomme si le m\u00e9dium n'\u00e9tait apte \u00e0 d\u00e9gager cette force qu'en\nla croyant fournie par une intelligence \u00e9trang\u00e8re.\nJe rappellerai ici qu'on a construit des appareils tr\u00e8s simples,\ndont le principe est le suivant. Un fil de soie porte \u00e0 l'une\ndes extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s une petite tige m\u00e9tallique qui se d\u00e9place sur\nun cadran gradu\u00e9. Le tout est enferm\u00e9 dans un cylindre de\nverre, de sorte que les mouvements de l'air ne peuvent d\u00e9\nplacer la barrette suspendue. Cet appareil (magn\u00e9tom\u00e8tre de\nFortin) a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par H. Baraduc pour d\u00e9celer le soi\ndisant fluide vital d\u00e9gag\u00e9 par les divers individus, variant\navec chaque personne, variant aussi suivant l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et\nde maladie de ces personnes. M\u00eame il para\u00eetrait, d'apr\u00e8s\nBaraduc, que la nature morale de chaque individu serait\ncaract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par un sp\u00e9cial d\u00e9placement angulaire de cette\npetite machine. J'ai \u00e0 peine besoin de vous dire que les\nobservations faites par Baraduc sont souvent enfantines, et ne\ndonnent gu\u00e8re envie de s'engager dans une pareille \u00e9tude.\nCependant le probl\u00e8me m\u00e9riterait de tenter les physiciens,\nd'autant plus qu'apr\u00e8s tout c'est une question de physique.\nQuelle est la part des influences \u00e9lectriques, ou thermiques,\nque l'approche de la main exerce sur le fil de soie ? La\nquestion est assez ardue ; mais, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle soit com\npl\u00e8tement \u00e9lucid\u00e9e, il ne sera pas permis de parler du fluide\nvital. Il nous faudra de bien d'autres preuves pour admettre\nl'existence d'une nouvelle force dans le monde.\n{E) L\u00e9vitations.\nUne autre forme, tout \u00e0 fait sp\u00e9ciale, des actions m\u00e9caniques\nd'origine m\u00e9tapsychique, ce sont les l\u00e9vitations.\nDans les vies des saints les l\u00e9vitations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 souvent\nracont\u00e9es. Mais ces r\u00e9cits de miracles sont sujets \u00e0 caution ;\net nous devons \u00eatre tr\u00e8s r\u00e9serv\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet.\nToutefois, de nos jours, il est difficile de nier qu'il y a\neu des l\u00e9vitations authentiques. Tout en attribuant une pro\ndigieuse habilet\u00e9 aux magiciens de l'Inde, on ne peut gu\u00e8re,\nen pr\u00e9sence de certaines narrations pr\u00e9cises, douter que quel\nques fakirs aient pu s'\u00e9lever au dessus du sol. N'ayant\nrien vu d'analogue, je ne puis \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9mettre une\n\ft.] La M\u00e9tap&ychique. 23\nopinion qui ait quelque autorit\u00e9 : je constate seulement qu'on\naurait le plus grand tort de ne pas examiner de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s\nles all\u00e9gations que des t\u00e9moins judicieux nous apportent.\nUn officier de marine fran\u00e7ais, assez sceptique, et nullement\nport\u00e9 au mysticisme, m'affirmait r\u00e9cemment avoir vu un fakir\ns'\u00e9lever de quelques centim\u00e8tres, lentement, au dessus du sol ;\net cela, en plein jour, sans v\u00eatements, sur le grand chemin.\nDans la vie de Douglas Home, se trouvent aussi relat\u00e9s\nde nombreux cas de l\u00e9vitation, attest\u00e9s par des t\u00e9moins de\nmoralit\u00e9 et d'intelligence irr\u00e9prochables. On a peine \u00e0 supposer\nqu'ils ont mal vu et mal observ\u00e9 un fait si facile \u00e0 observer\net \u00e0 voir. Dira-t-on que D. Home a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 les tromper\nainsi cinquante fois et davantage ? En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, s'il ne s'agissait\npas d'une science exp\u00e9rimentale o\u00f9 l'exp\u00e9rience doit \u00eatre\nr\u00e9p\u00e9table, et si le t\u00e9moignage humain \u00e9tait suffisant, les\npreuves de la l\u00e9vitation de D. Home seraient surabondantes.\nMais nous devons \u00eatre pour la m\u00e9tapsychique plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res\nque pour une science historique. Nous la voulons exp\u00e9ri\nmentale, non traditionnelle, et nous ne nous lasserons pas\nde demander l'exp\u00e9rience apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage ; n\u00e9 nous esti\nmant satisfaits que si les conditions de la l\u00e9vitation peuvent\n\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es, et si cet extraordinaire ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne peut \u00eatre\nenregistr\u00e9 par des appareils scientifiques.\n(C) Ecriture directe.\nAvec l'\u00e9criture directe, obtenue sans qu'il y ait contact\nentre la plume \u00e9crivante et le m\u00e9dium, nous avons une\ns\u00e9rie de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes plus \u00e9tranges encore. Naturellement, si\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 il y avait quelque h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 affirmer la l\u00e9vitation,\nl'incertitude est plus grande encore pour affirmer l'\u00e9criture\ndirecte. En effet, peu de m\u00e9diums seraient capables de la\nproduire ; et la fraude est relativement facile.\nIl faut donc soumettre les cas observ\u00e9s \u00e0 une critique\ns\u00e9v\u00e8re, et provoquer de nouvelles exp\u00e9riences.\n(D) Autres ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes m\u00e9caniques.\n(a) Maisons hant\u00e9es.\nIl para\u00eet que de grands ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes m\u00e9caniques se pro\nduisent dans les maisons hant\u00e9es.

Si la\nsolidit\u00e9 des preuves \u00e9tait en rapport avec l'intensit\u00e9 des\nbruits, rien ne serait plus certain que la hantise des maisons ;\ncar il s'y produirait des fracas effroyables. Mais il ne faut\npas se laisser \u00e9tourdir par tout ce tapage ; et, comme pour\nla l\u00e9vitation, comme pour l'\u00e9criture directe, nous devons dire\nque sub judice lis est.\n(\/S) Vibrations vocales.\nOn a pr\u00e9tendu que parfois des voix se faisaient entendre,\naccessibles \u00e0 plusieurs personnes, soit dans les maisons hant\u00e9es,\nsoit dans certaines s\u00e9ances de mat\u00e9rialisations.\n(y) Empreintes ; moulages, contacts.\nLe plus souvent, quand des mat\u00e9rialisations se produisent,\nce ne sont que des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes lumineux ; mais on a rap\nport\u00e9 quelques cas d'empreintes de moulages laiss\u00e9s par ces\nformes mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9es. Malheureusement les exemples qu'on a\ncit\u00e9s n'ont rien de bien d\u00e9monstratif, et, dans quelques cas,\nil semble bien qu'il y a eu fraude, puisqu'on a trouv\u00e9 dans\nl'empreinte re\u00e7ue les traces d'un l\u00e9ger tissu dont les mailles\ns'\u00e9taient imprim\u00e9es sur l'argile.\nCependant je ne conclurai pas n\u00e9gativement ; car dans\nbon nombre de cas, en des conditions bien rigoureuses, des\ncontacts de mains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7us.\nS'il est vrai que des formes lumineuses se sont montr\u00e9es\n\u00e0 des exp\u00e9rimentateurs, il est alors tout aussi vrai que ces\nformes pouvaient exercer une action m\u00e9canique ext\u00e9rieure.\nLa m\u00eame force qui a produit une lumi\u00e8re peut tout aussi\nbien exercer une action m\u00e9canique de contact. En fait,\nbeaucoup de spirites affirment avoir touch\u00e9 les mains de\nces fant\u00f4mes, et dans les r\u00e9cits de s\u00e9ances il est souvent\nquestion de mains, grandes ou petites, chaudes ou froides,\navec bagues ou sans bagues, s\u00e8ches ou humides. Je me doute\nbien qu'il y a dans ces r\u00e9cits imag\u00e9s une grande part d'illu\nsion, et je sais qu'il est tr\u00e8s difficile d'\u00eatre absolument sur\nque les mains du m\u00e9dium sont solidement tenues de mani\u00e8re\n\u00e0 \u00e9viter toute fraude. Mais, quand on est bien averti\nqu'une fraude est possible, on prend toutes les mesures n\u00e9ces\nsaires, de sorte que tout n'est pas erron\u00e9 peut-\u00eatre. Donc,\n\fL.] La M&apsychique. 25\nfiddle a mon principe d'etre aussi reserve dans la negative\nque dans 1'affirmative, je ne preiendrai pas que des actions\nmecaniques ne puissent etre excretes par des forces ayant\napparence humaine. Si elles ont revetu les formes et les\nmouvements d'un homme qui vit, pourquoi n'exerceraient-\nelles pas les memes forces mecaniques que 1'homme vivant ?\nCes diffeYentes manifestations de forces occultes (que nous\nappellerons maiutenant, si vous m'y autorisez, me\"tapsychiques),\nsent peut-etre sans relation entre elles. Nous les groupons\nprovisoirement sous la denomination commune de forces mecani\nques. Mais il n'est pas certain qu'elles relevent de la me'me\ncaase. C'est par ignorance peut-etre que nous les rangeons dans\nnn liii'inc chapitre : et 1'avenir peut fort bien nous prouver\nqu'elles sont profondement dissemblables, et sans lien re\"ciproque.\n2\u00b0. La second groupe des phenomenes materiels comprend les\nphe\"nomenes lumineux ; c'est a dire la production de lumieres,\nde lueurs, de fantomes.

Formes lumineuses bien distinctes, et materialisations\ncompletes.\nFour se rendre compte de 1'extreme difficulte a emettre\nune affirmation ou une negation formelles, je me contenterai\nde rappeler 1'etonnante histoire des rayons N.\nII y a peu d'anne\"es un savant physicieii de Nancy, le\nprofesseur Blondlot, decouvrit que divers corps emettent des\nrayons qui different des rayons electriques ou thermiques; et\nil appela rayons N ces nouvelles vibrations. II put meme\nen donner les constantes physiques et les longueurs\nd'onde. Puis, poursuivant ses recherches, il montra que ces\nrayons ont la propriete de renforcer la luminosite\" du sulfure\nde calcium. Avec d'eminents collaborateure, M. Charpentier,\nM. Bichat, M. Meyer, professeurs a Nancy, il fut amene\" a\nconstater que les centres nerveux, et les muscles (quand ils\nse contractent), degagent des rayons N ; car une plaque re-\ncouverte de sulfure de calcium devient avec plus d'intensite\"\nphosphorescente quand on 1'approche du cceur, ou de la tete ;\nde sorte que tout phe'nomene vital, une pensee, comme une\ncontraction musculaire, serait une source de rayons N.\n\f26 M. Charles Ricl\u0153t. [part\nVoil\u00e0 donc des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes constat\u00e9s par des physiciens\net des physiologistes dans des conditions d'exp\u00e9rimentation qui\nparaissent faciles, puisque il n'est pas besoin des complications\nqu'exige toute s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9tapsychique, et que la pr\u00e9sence d'un\nm\u00e9dium n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire. Eh bien ! malgr\u00e9 cette facilit\u00e9\napparente, la preuve des rayons N n'a pu \u00eatre donn\u00e9e en\ncore. Et des savants distingu\u00e9s doutent de leur existence.\nIl est possible que les rayons N n'existent pas, m\u00eame dans\nles objets inanim\u00e9s, la o\u00f9 M. Blondlot avait cru les trouver,\nde sorte que le monde des physiciens conna\u00eet maintenant\nles angoisses d'incertitude qui avaient sembl\u00e9 jusque l\u00e0 r\u00e9serv\u00e9es\naux seuls adeptes des sciences occultes ; et qu'il se partage\nen deux groupes : celui qui croit \u00e0 l'existence des rayons\nN, et celui qui n'y croit pas.\nOn multiplie les exp\u00e9riences, on accumule les preuves, on\nprend des photographies de l'\u00e9tincelle \u00e9lectrique, du sulfure\nde calcium phosphorescent, et cependant le doute subsiste\nencore. Les journaux scientifiques sont remplis de discussions\nqui s'engagent sur un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne dont la constatation se\npr\u00e9sente comme tr\u00e8s simple ; et finalement ces rayons N\nsont si vigoureusement et universellement contest\u00e9s que m\u00eame\nceux qui avaient eu d'abord le plus de confiance dans les\naffirmations de M. Blondlot sont forc\u00e9s de suspendre leur\njugement et d'attendre ; encore que, selon toute vraisem\nblance, M. Blondlot n'ait pas commis cette colossale erreur.\nCet exemple est bon \u00e0 m\u00e9diter ; car il nous prouvera h\nquel point un fait nouveau est parfois difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir quand\nles m\u00e9thodes d'investigation et de contr\u00f4le sont incertaines.\nSi les h\u00e9sitations sont telles pour un fait d'ordre pure\nment physique, comme la phosphorescence du sulfure de\ncalcium par l'action des rayons N, combien ne sont-elles pas\nplus l\u00e9gitimes encore quand il s'agit d'affirmer l'existence\nde lumi\u00e8res, de vapeurs lumineuses, de formes mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9es ?\nTout concourt \u00e0 entourer l'exp\u00e9rience de myst\u00e8re. D'abord\nle ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne ne peut \u00eatre provoqu\u00e9 que par un petit\nnombre de personnes. Rares sont les m\u00e9diums ; plus rares\nencore les m\u00e9diums qui donnent des mat\u00e9rialisations. On\nne peut ni les toucher ; ni s'approcher d'eux ; ni d\u00e9ranger\nle cours de l'exp\u00e9rimentation par de brusques contr\u00f4les. Une\ndemi lumi\u00e8re est indispensable, parfois m\u00eame l'obscurit\u00e9.\n\fu] La M\u00e9tapayckique. 27\nToute modification du plan pr\u00e9par\u00e9 arr\u00eate la manifestation\nattendue. Le m\u00e9dium s'\u00e9puise vite, et l'exp\u00e9rience ne peut\nse refaire qu'\u00e0 d'assez longs intervalles.\nIl semble, \u00e0 voir toutes ces complications, que l'\u00e9tude des\nrayons N ne soit que jeu d'enfant, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tude des\nlumi\u00e8res et des fant\u00f4mes.\nVous ne serez donc pas surpris si, malgr\u00e9 les \u00e9clatantes\naffirmations d'observateurs sagaces et dignes de foi, malgr\u00e9 une\nabondante s\u00e9rie de preuves, que les journaux spirites ont\naccumul\u00e9es, nous pensons que notre jugement doit \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9.\nMais cette r\u00e9serve peut s'interpr\u00e9ter de deux mani\u00e8res bien\ndiff\u00e9rentes ; et en effet deux observateurs, ayant une opinion\ndiam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9e, peuvent, s'ils sont sages, rester l'un et\nl'autre dans la m\u00eame r\u00e9serve. M\u00eame c'est leur devoir \u00e0 tous\ndeux de r\u00e9server leur jugement. Le premier croit que le ph\u00e9no\nm\u00e8ne existe ; que les preuves sont nettes, que les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes\nobserv\u00e9s sont convaincants ; le second, au contraire, pense que\nla supercherie et l'illusion jouent le principal r\u00f4le dans ce\nqu'il a vu ou cru voir, comme dans les r\u00e9cits qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9\nrapport\u00e9s. Et alors ces deux hommes, que je suppose sages\nl'un et l'autre, reconna\u00eetront, l'un qu'une affirmation absolue\nest quelque peu t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ; l'autre, qu'une n\u00e9gation formelle\nest impossible, sans nouvelles exp\u00e9rimentations.\nPour ma part, si vous me permettez d'indiquer l'opinion\nvers laquelle je penche, je serais tent\u00e9 de croire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9\nde ces formes lumineuses, de ces lueurs, de ces mat\u00e9rialisa\ntions. Car j'h\u00e9site \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vu et d\u00e9crit\npar R. Wallace, par William Crookes, par 0. Lodge, par A.\nde Rochas, par bien d'autres encore, tout cela ne fut que\nsupercherie, fraude et illusion. Et d'autre part j'ai cru voir\ndans de bonnes conditions, en des s\u00e9ances\u2014dont le d\u00e9tail ne\npeut \u00eatre donn\u00e9 ici\u2014des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes analogues. Voil\u00e0 pour\nquoi, en pr\u00e9sence de ces faits, ma r\u00e9serve\u2014et une r\u00e9serve\ndont je tiens \u00e0 faire ici la formelle affirmation\u2014est plutot\nune r\u00e9serve favorable.\nAssur\u00e9ment la production de forces lumineuses, de fant\u00f4mes,\nde formes mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9es, n'est pas de certitude aussi grande\nque la composition de l'ammoniaque, ou la loi des oscillations\ndu pendule ; mais il me faudrait une bien d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rante\ns\u00e9rie d'exp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives pour me forcer \u00e0 rejeter comme\n\f28 M. Charles Richet. [part\nl\u00e9gendaires et d\u00e9finitivement erron\u00e9s les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes lumineux\nobjectifs de la m\u00e9tapsychique.\nD'ailleurs qu'importe ? Qu'on y croie ou qu'on n'y croie pas,\nau fond la conclusion doit \u00eatre la m\u00eame ; c'est que de nou\nvelles exp\u00e9riences sont n\u00e9cessaires. M\u00eame les sciences qui\nsemblent achev\u00e9es sont dans un \u00e9tat de perp\u00e9tuelle \u00e9volution\nqui n\u00e9cessite sans cesse de nouvelles recherches. A plus forte\nraison alors pour les sciences \u00e0 peine n\u00e9es, embryonnaires\nencore, comme la n\u00f4tre, o\u00f9 tout est inconnu, m\u00e9thodes et\nfins derni\u00e8res ; o\u00f9 toute affirmation des faits les plus simples\nest \u00e0 la fois t\u00e9m\u00e9raire et incertaine.\nAvant de terminer ces courtes paroles relatives aux appari\ntions fantomatiques, il faut tenter de distinguer ce qui en elles\nest objectif et ce qui est subjectif. Dans le chapitre consacr\u00e9\naux faits mat\u00e9riels, nous n'avons pas fait allusion \u00e0 ce que\nvous avez, avec Fr. Myers, appel\u00e9 hallucinations v\u00e9ridiques.\nCar dans ce cas il est probable que nul ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne mat\u00e9riel,\ndans le sens vulgaire du mot mat\u00e9riel, ne s'ext\u00e9riorise. La per\nception, \u00e0 distance, d'une mort ou d'un danger, ou d'un\n\u00e9v\u00e9nement, se traduit dans l'esprit du voyant par un ph\u00e9no\nm\u00e8ne visuel. Il croit voir ou entendre quelqu'un ou quelque\nchose. Mais probablement c'est par la pens\u00e9e qu'il voit, de\nsorte qu'il symbolise sa pens\u00e9e en une forme mat\u00e9rielle ext\u00e9\nrieure. Aussi les cas, nombreux et authentiques, o\u00f9 une vision\nv\u00e9ridique a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9e, ne doivent ils pas \u00eatre class\u00e9s parmi\nles ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes mat\u00e9riels. Il faut, pour parler de leur\nmat\u00e9rialit\u00e9, que l'apparition (ou la lumi\u00e8re) soit per\u00e7ue par plu\nsieurs personnes, ou qu'elle ait d\u00e9plac\u00e9 des objets, ou qu'elle\nait impressionn\u00e9 une plaque photographique.\nPuisque je prononce le mot de photographie, il me semble\nque c'est \u00e0 obtenir des photographies irr\u00e9prochables que nous\ndevons tendre. De m\u00eame que M. Blondlot et M. Charpentier\nl'essayent en ce moment pour les rayons N, de m\u00eame nous\ndevons pour les mat\u00e9rialisations faire tous nos efforts afin d'en\nobtenir des images, qui soient le souvenir ind\u00e9l\u00e9bile et le\nt\u00e9moignage imp\u00e9rissable du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne. Je ne sais vraiment\npas pourquoi, maintenant que la photographie est \u00e0 la port\u00e9e\ndu premier \u00e9colier venu, les exp\u00e9rimentateurs n'emploient pas\ndavantage ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le, qui est si simple, et qui\nentra\u00eenerait la conviction.\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsychique. 29\nSi nous poss\u00e9dions vraiment quelques photographies prises\ndans des conditions de certitude absolue, toute discussion devien\ndrait inutile, et la preuve serait faite. Mais, par malheur,\njusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, ces photographies irr\u00e9cusables n'existent pas.\nPeut-\u00eatre en est-il qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es encore ; mais,\ns'il faut se contenter de celles qui ont paru daus les livres,\njournaux et revues, elles n'entrainent pas la conviction.\nIl est d'ailleurs assez remarquable que les images photo\ngraphiques de fant\u00f4mes\u2014je ne parle que de celles qui ont\n\u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es\u2014pr\u00eatent largement \u00e0 la critique ; car les person\nnages ont des apparences de mannequins ou de poup\u00e9es ; de\nsorte que c'est pour le public qui les regarde un sujet de\nfacile raillerie. Mais cette apparence de fraude ne nie touche\ngu\u00e8re, et ce n'est pas l\u00e0 dessus que porteront mes objections.\nJ'admets fort bien qu'une mat\u00e9rialisation ne puisse rev\u00eatir\nnettement les apparences d'un \u00eatre vivant, et qu'elle ait forme\nde poup\u00e9e ; car, en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, nous ne savons rien des conditions dans\nlesquelles un fant\u00f4me apparait sur une plaque photographique.\nDonc, si la photographie a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise sur une plaque marqu\u00e9e \u00e0\nl'avance, si cette plaque a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par l'exp\u00e9rimentateur\nlui-m\u00eame, savant de bonne foi incontest\u00e9e, sans que cette\nplaque ait jamais, pendant un seul instant, quitt\u00e9 ses mains,\nalors, sans que cela me trouble beaucoup, j'accorderai \u00e0 l'image\nfantomatique toutes les apparences qu'on voudra, de poup\u00e9e\nou de mannequin, \u00e0 condition, bien entendu, qu'on puisse\nplusieurs fois r\u00e9p\u00e9ter cette exp\u00e9rience. Mais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le\nmanuel op\u00e9ratoire de ces photographies spirites est confi\u00e9 \u00e0\ndes praticiens peu scrupuleux, et ils ont toutes facilit\u00e9s pour\nfaire les manipulations n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la production d'une image\nparasite juxtapos\u00e9e au personnage principal.\nPuisque notre Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, dont l'autorit\u00e9 est si grande, a des\nressources notables, il me para\u00eet que c'est surtout vers des\nconstatations photographiques que nous devrions diriger nos\nefforts. Apr\u00e8s tout le m\u00e9tier de photographe n'a rien de bien\ndifficile, quand on ne cherche pas \u00e0 obtenir des chefs d'oeuvre\nartistiques, mais seulement un contr\u00f4le documentaire, perma\nnent, de ce que nos yeux ont rapidement per\u00e7u. Donc,\nchaque fois qu'un cas nous est signal\u00e9 o\u00f9 il y a eu des\nlumi\u00e8res, des apparences lumineuses, des mat\u00e9rialisations visibles\n\u00e0 tous, il faudrait aussit\u00f4t en recueillir la photographie, et cela\n\f30 M. Charles Richet. [part\navec toutes les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour que pas un doute\nne puisse s'\u00e9lever sur l'authenticit\u00e9 de la plaque.\nSi la certitude exp\u00e9rimentale est absolue, peu nous impor\ntera alors que l'image soit dramatique ou non : il suffira qu'une\ntache blanche quelconque, non imputable \u00e0 une erreur de\ntechnique, apparaisse sur la plaque; car c'est une question\nd'int\u00e9r\u00eat secondaire que d'obtenir des formes ayant ap\nparences humaines. Nous devons borner nos d\u00e9sirs \u00e0 de plus\nmodestes constatations : une lumi\u00e8re, si vague qu'elle soit, nous\nsuffira, pourvu que ne soient pas vagues les conditions dans\nlesquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillie et fix\u00e9e. Ce ne sont pas les\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes les plus extraordinaires et les plus compliqu\u00e9s\nque nous devons rechercher ; mais ceux qui sont le plus\nrigoureusement observ\u00e9s. Notre grand effort doit tendre \u00e0\nobtenir des faits, \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires peut-\u00eatre, mais des faits aux\nquels on ne puisse rien reprocher.\nSi les photographies authentiques ne sont pas plus abondantes,\nc'est probablement parce qu'on n'a pas daign\u00e9, bien \u00e0 tort,\nessayer d'enregistrer de simples stries lumineuses. On a voulu\nprobablement attendre que ces lueurs aient pris l'apparence\nd'une personne humaine. Car on avait toujours l'espoir que\ncette image humaine, reproduite par la photographie, serait\nune preuve de la survivance. Mais j'oserai dire qu'il faut\nrel\u00e9guer au second et m\u00eame au troisi\u00e8me plan ces aspirations,\nd'ordre non scientifique, vers la survivance de la per\nsonnalit\u00e9 humaine. Attachons nous seulement \u00e0 ceci, qui est\nprobable, quoique encore contestable ; qu'autour de certains\nrares m\u00e9diums, dans des conditions particuli\u00e8res, il se forme\ndes vibrations lumineuses, que la r\u00e9tine humaine peut perce\nvoir, et que la plaque photographique peut enregistrer.\nPlus tard il ne sera pas interdit d'aller plus loin, et ce\nn'est pas moi qui conseillerai la timidit\u00e9 aux exp\u00e9rimentateurs.\nMais la sagesse conseille de commencer par le commencement.\nQuand on construit un \u00e9difice, on se pr\u00e9occupe d'abord de lui\ndonner des bases solides, et on ne va pas mettre de d\u00e9cora\ntions au chapiteau et au fronton, quand les assises m\u00eames,\nsur lesquelles repose le temple, sont encore branlantes.\nNous conclurons donc que, pour tous ces ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes lumi\nneux, ces fant\u00f4mes, ces apparitions, il faut, de parti pris, aban\ndonner les r\u00e9cits sensationnels, et faire comme les physiciens\n\fL.] La Metap&ychique. 31\ndevant un difficile probleme de physique ; c'est a dire s'occuper\nde ce qui est simple, e\"liminer les causes d'erreur et les com\nplications, ramener le probleme a sa forme elementaire.\nY a-t-il, par la force que dfyagent les mediums, production\nde vibrations lumineuses ? Si oui, on peut le constater par\nla photographic, et la voie de la recherche a, suivre est tout\nindique\"e.\n3\u00b0. Un des plus curieux chapitres a eerire sur les pheno-\nmenes materiels, c'est celui qui a trait aux apports,\ntransports, penetrations de la matiere. Je ne vois aucune\nimpossibilite a de pareils faits. Les re\"centes et troublantes\nexperiences relatives au radium nous prouvent que le vieux\ndogme de 1'increabilite de la matiere est peut-etre errone, de\nsorte que je ne me refuse nullement a priori a, admettre que\ndes apports puissent exister.\nMais de la a conclure qu'ils existent, il y a loin, et je ne\ncrois pas etre trop timide en disant que tout ce chapitre de\nla metapsychique mate\"rielle (mutations et transports de la\nmatiere) est 1'incertitude meme.\nDans les phe\"nomenes objectifs nous devons faire rentrer\nencore :\n4\u00b0.

L'action des fluides vitaux (?) ou des passes mag-\nnetiques, ou de 1'aimant, sur les organismes sains et normaux.\nPar ces cotes la science metapsychique est aux confins de\nla physiologic me'me, mais d'une physiologic bien incertaine\nencore. Une experience\u2014plus extraordinaire peut-etre que\ntous les recits les plus extraordinaires\u2014est racontee par\nHome. II pouvait prendre dans sa main, et sans se bruler,\nun charbon incandescent. Que faut-il penser de ce fait pro-\ndigieux ?\nL'aimant exerce-t-il une action sur les organismes, comme\n1'a pretendu Reichenbach ?\nLes phenomenes d'extase, d'hibernation humaine; les enseve-\nlissements de fakirs par exemple, sont-ils reels ou apocryphes ?\nEt quant & 1'action sur 1'evolution des maladies, il a ete\ndit, que, me'me en dehors de toute suggestion, il y a influence\ndu fluide magn&ique humain sur les organismes vivants.\n\f32 M. Charles Richet. [PART\nAinsi, par exemple, on aurait gue>i de tres jeunes enfanta\npar 1'imposition des mains.\nTout cela n'est que 1'indication des chapitres qu'on aurait k\n4crire ; et n'implique nullement 1'opinion que les phenomenes\nsont redls. Je veux dire seulement qu'ils meritent 1'etude.\nJe ne pretends pas qu'ils soient vrais ; je dis seulement qu'ils\npeuvent 1'e'tre ; car il faut se me\"fier des negations a priori, et,\nsi extraordinaire que nous semble 1'influence d'un medium ou\nd'un magnetiseur sur I'evolution d'un phenomene morbide, il\nserait te\"meraire d'assurer que cette influence est impossible.\nV.\nTels sont a peu pres, si je ne me trompe, les principaux\nphenomenes objectifs de notre science. Nous arrivons a la\nseconde partie ; c'est a dire a la metapsychique subjective.\nIci les methodes doivent etre toutes difterentes, car il ne\ns'agit plus de constater des phenomenes materiels, mais bien\ndes faits psychologiques.\nUn parallelisme interessant se presente tout de suite entre ce\nqui est subjectif et ce qui est objectif. De me\"me que nous\navons fait rentrer, par definition meme, dans la metapsychique\nobjective, les faits que les forces physiques actuellement connues\net classe\"cs ne peuvent expliquer, de meme vont ressortir de la\nme\"tapsychique subjective tous les phenomenes de connaissance\nque nos process ordinaires de connaissauce ne permettent pas\n\u2022d'expliquer.\nLes connaissances de 1'homme de'rivent de sensations et de\nraisonnements. Nous sommes par nos sens en relation avec le\nmonde exterieur; nous pouvons a la suite de ces sensations\nconclure, raisonner, induire, de\"duire ; et nulle connaissance du\nmonde exterieur ne peut, d'apres la science classique, deliver\nd'autres proce\"des d'information.\nPar exemple je puis connaitre la mort de Pierre, parce que\nje la vois, ou parce qu'on me la raconte ; ou encore parce\nque, le sachant tres malade hier, je peux conclure avec presque\ncertitude qu'aujourd'hui il est mort. La connaissance que\nj'ai de la mort de Pierre sera un phenomene mental simple,\nque des sensations ou des deductions rationnelles expliquent\n\"'\u2022me maniere adequate. Mais, si, ayant laisse\" tout a 1'heure\n\fL.] La M&apsychique. 33\nPierre en parfait e\"tat de sante, sans qu'aucun danger le\nmenace, et me trouvant trop loin pour le voir on 1'entendre,\nje viens tout a coup a affirmer que Pierre est mort, au\nmoment meme ou il est frappc'- par un coup imprcvu, alors il\ns'agira d'un phenomena de metapsychique ; puisque aucune\nsensation, aucun raisonnement ne pourront expliquer la con-\nnaissance de ce fait.\nNous definirons done les phenomenes me\"tapsychiques sub-\njectifs, des connaissances qui ont d'autres origines que nos\nperceptions et nos raisonnements ordinaires.\nSi j'insiste sur ces definitions, c'est que souvent des con\nfusions s'e\"tablissent, dont le point de depart est une incerti\ntude dans la definition meme. Pascal, qui s'y connaissait,\ndeclarait que la science est une langue bieu faite. II est\ndone bien important de pre\"ciser tous les termes qu'on emploie.\nAlors cela nous conduit tout de suite a discuter ce point\nfondamental. Existe-t-il pour Intelligence humaine des con\nnaissances ayant d'autres origines que nos perceptions et nos\nsensations ? Toute la question est la, et, si nous re\"pondons\npar 1'affirmative, il s'ensuivra qu'il y a une metapsychique\nd'ordre subjectif.\nII est vrai qu'on parle souvent du hasard, comme jouant\nun grand role dans ces \" soi-disant connaissances. Mais je\ncrains fort que les sceptiques, qui, lorsque nous leur racontons\nune experience, viennent nous objector qu'elle est due & un\nhasard heureux, n'aient guere re\"fle\"chi sur le hasard et le cal-\ncul des probabilites.\nJe tiens a discuter ici, tres brievement, cette influence du\nhasard ; car on le fait intervenir a tort et a travers, et on\ns'abandonne a bien des fantaisies, des qu'on parle des proba-\nbilites.\nQuand un chimiste fait une pese\"e, il ne songe jamais que\nle hasard a pu lui donner le chiffre qu'il obtient. Assure\"ment\nil a pu se tromper en comptant les poids qui sont sur la\nbalance ; ou il a eu affaire a un produit impur ; ou il s'est\nservi d'une balance deTectueuse ; en un mot il a pu faire une\nmauvaise experience, mais ce n'est jamais par hasard que tel\nou tel chiffre a ete\" trouve\". Et alors notre chimiste ne se\npreoccupe pas du hasard, et il a raison ; car, a trouver un\nnombre qui est seulement de trois chiffres, la probabilite\"\nc\n\f34 M. Charles Richet. [part\nd'avoir tel chiffre plut\u00f4t qu'un autre par le fait du hasard est\nde j-^j, c'est \u00e0 dire tout \u00e0 fait n\u00e9gligeable.\nQue, dans une exp\u00e9rience de lucidit\u00e9, ou de t\u00e9l\u00e9pathie, avec\nun jeu de cartes ; on dise une premi\u00e8re fois la carte pens\u00e9e ;\nla probabilit\u00e9 est de ^. Certes le hasard peut donner ce\nchiffre ; mais que deux fois de suite la carte pens\u00e9e soit\nindiqu\u00e9e, alors la probabilit\u00e9 devient tr\u00e8s faible \u201e 710 4 ; et, quoique\nle hasard puisse encore donner ce chiffre, il ne le donne, pas.\nImplicitement on reconna\u00eet cela, quand on n'est pas aveugl\u00e9\npar le d\u00e9sir de trouver un d\u00e9faut \u00e0 des exp\u00e9riences irr\u00e9pro\nchables ; car, dans la pratique quotidienne de la vie, on ne fait\njamais intervenir ces probabilit\u00e9s faibles. Si vous jouez \u00e0\nl'\u00e9cart\u00e9 avec un individu qui quatre fois de suite retourne le\nroi, vous serez tent\u00e9 de supposer qu'il triche ; car la probabilit\u00e9\n40198 de retourner le roi quatre fois de suite est tr\u00e8s faible.\nDonc quand, dans des exp\u00e9riences de typtologie, un nom\nest obtenu, le nom de Marguerite par exemple, m\u00eame si\nl'on ne tient compte que des quatre premi\u00e8res lettres, la\nprobabilit\u00e9 d'avoir Marg. . . est de ^\"4 soit 3 - 018 \u201e 5 ; c'est \u00e0 dire\nextr\u00eamement faible. Si, jouant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart\u00e9, vous avez devant vous\nun adversaire qui retourne le roi six fois de suite, vous serez\ntent\u00e9 de quitter la partie, bien persuad\u00e9, que ce n'est pas le\nhasard qui lui a fait avec cette persistance obtenir l'heureuse\ncarte, qui le fait gagner.\nLa probabilit\u00e9, pour chacun de nous, de n'\u00eatre plus vivant\ndans deux heures est moindre que la probabilit\u00e9 d'obtenir le mot\nde Marguerite en tirant au hasard les lettres de l'alphabet.\nEt cependant nous passons notre existence \u00e0 supposer que\nnous serons encore vivants dans deux heures : et nous avons\nraison.\nC'est pour ne pas avoir suffisamment r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes\nqu'on objecte le hasard. R\u00e9solument je repousse cette objec\ntion, car elle n'est fond\u00e9e sur rien, et elle est contraire \u00e0\ntoute la tradition scientifique. Objectez, si vous voulez, les\nd\u00e9fauts de l'exp\u00e9rience\u2014et vous aurez, h\u00e9las ! presque toujours\nraison\u2014mais ne parlez pas de hasard ; car pour un exp\u00e9ri\nmentateur il n'y a pas de hasard.\nCe n'est pas le hasard qui rend incertaines nos exp\u00e9riences\nde m\u00e9tapsychique subjective; c'est notre d\u00e9fectueuse m\u00e9thode\nd'exp\u00e9rimentation, car nous ne savons pas tenir compte suffi-\n\fL.] La Metapsychique. 35\nsamment d'un phenomene psychologique d'essentielle importance,\ntrop souvent meconnu, la memoire inconsciente.\nII y a eu de ce fait tant de graves erreurs qu'il convient\nde nous expliquer formellement a cet egard.\nAutrefois la memoire etait considere\"e comme une faculto\nintellectuelle tres simple. II est des faits dont on se souvient,\nd'autres dont on ne se souvient pas : par consequent la limite\nest nettement traoe\"e entre les reminiscences et les creations\nmentales. D'un cote, des choses que 1'on a connues et qui\nreparaissent : de 1'autre des choses qu'on ignore, et qu'on con-\nstruit par 1'imagination et le raisonnement.\nMais 1'etude approfondie de 1'hypnotisme a eu, entre autres,\nce pre\"cieux avantage de nous faire connaitre toute une\nserie de phenomenes bien singuliers sur la memoire, et de\nnous reveler que la memoire est une faculte implacable de\nnotre intelligence ; car aucune de nos perceptions n'est jamais\noubliee.\nDes qu'un fait a frappe nos sens, alors, de maniere irre\nmediable, il se fixe dans la memoire. Peu importe qu'il\npuisse etre evoque a notre gre : peu importe que nous ayions\ngarde la conscience de ce souvenir ; il existe, il est indelebile.\nII va s'unir et se combiner a d'autres perceptions egalement\ninconscientes ; et il peut, dans certains etats mentaux parti-\nculiers, reparaitre en son integrite, alors que, s'il fallait en\ncroire le temoignage de notre conscience, toute trace semble\nen avoir a jamais disparu. Mais non ! II n'a pas disparu. II\ndort en nous, completement ignore de nous.\nEn un mot, la conscience oublie souvent; I'intelligence n'oublie\njamais.\nCette memoire inconsciente, subliminale, pour employer\n1'heureux mot de Fred. Myers, est toujours e\"veillee, attentive,\nperspicace. Elle se mele a tous nos sentiments, a toutes nos\nvolontes, k tous nos actes ; elle agit, pense, raisonne ; elle con-\nstitue un veritable moi, mais un moi inconscient, qui a, sur le\nmoi conficient, cet avantage inappreciable de ne jamais laisser\nperdre la plus petite parcelle de ce que les choses et les\nhommes, dans le cours de notre existence, nous ont apporte\".\nOn voit combien sont graves les consequences de cette per-\nsistance des souvenirs. Nous avons tous, les uns et les autres,\n\u2014surtout ceux dont la vie est deja a son dedin\u2014lu, vu,\n\f36 M. Charles Richet. [PABT\nentendu, tant et tant de choses qu'il est impossible, malgre\" la\nsurete de notre memoire, d'affirmer que nous n'avons pas a tel\nou tel moment lu telle phrase, entendu telle parole, assiste a\ntel evenement. Aussi peut-on, en parfaite bonne foi, certifier\nque ce que nous pensons, en ce moment me'me, est une creation\nmentale, et non un souvenir; car non seulement nous ignorons\n1'avoir su, mais me\"me nous ne comprendons pas comment nous\navons pu le savoir. Si nous pouvions contempler cet immense\namas de souvenirs dont notre me\"moire inconsciente est la\nvigilante gardienne, nous serions veritablement stupeTaits ; car\nnous trouverions, dans ces images qui ont fixe\" tout le passe\nde notre existence, des tre\"sors absolument ignores.\nAussi bien les phe'nomenes de soi-disant lucidite\" ne sont\nils souvent que des souvenirs ; et, quoique la personne lucide\naffirme, en toute since\"rite\", et avec tout 1'e\"nergie d'une bonne\nfoi ardente, qu'elle ne savait rien, ce n'est pas assez pour que\nnous affirmions sa lucidite\". II faut que la preuve nous soit\ndonne\"e qu'il lui a e\"te\" absolument impossible d'avoir jamais\nrien su du fait qu'elle affirme. Ignorer aujourd'hui n'est rien ;\nil faut prouver qu'on a toujours ignore\". Si 1'on e\"tait plus\nsevere a constater cette impossibilite d'avoir su autrefois, on\neliminerait beaucoup de phe\"nomenes, de merveilleuse apparence,\nexplicables tres simplement par la re\"viviscence de souvenirs\nque la conscience avait totalement oublies.\nBien entendu, en e\"tablissant cette discussion, je ne pretends\nrien dire qui ne soit parfaitement connu de tous les psycho-\nlogues. Ce sont meme des verity's tres banales ; mais dans\n1'interpre\"tation des faits de lucidite^ on les a negligees si\nsouvent qu'il faut insister sans cesse sur cette cause d'erreur.\nAbordons maintenant la classification des phenomenes sub-\njectifs. Nous les envisagerons en eux-memes, sans rechercher\nquel a e\"te\" leur mode de production, sans nous demander s'ils\nderivent ou non de phe\"nomenes mate\"riels. Certes, quand un\nphenomene materiel, tel que les raps, est la cause immediate\nd'un beau phenomene psychique de lucidite, 1'expe\"rience est\ndoublement interessante ; mais 1'analyse scientifique doit dis-\nsocier ce phenomene unique, et examiner separe\"ment la\nmaterialite des vibrations me\"caniques (raps), et le sens des\nparoles prononceea (message).\nC'est ce dernier point seulement que nous e\"tudierons a\nr i\n\fL-] La Metapsychique. 37\npresent, puisque plus haut nous avons examine le cote objectif\net materiel des phenomenes.\nII me parait que tons les phenomenes subjectifs peuvent\nrecevoir la classification suivante :\n(1) LueidiU, c'est a dire connaissance de faits que les pro-\ncedes ordinaires de connaissance n'ont pas pu apporter.\n(2) Personnification, c'est h dire affirmation d'une person-\nN.-iliti' autre que celle du medium, et avec des\ncaracteres ve\"ridiques, que ni la perspicacite ni les\nsouvenirs ante\"rieurs ne peuvent donner.\n(3) Langages Grangers, totalement inconnus.\n(4) Premonitions.\nJe passerai en revue ces divers phenomenes.\n(1) LucidiU.\nLa lucidite\u2014ou clairvoyance\u2014est le phe\"nomene subjectif\nelementaire. A ce titre elle me\"rite toute notre attention.\nOn peut meme dire que tous les phenomenes subjectifs, quels\nqu'ils soient, pourraient etre compris sous le nom ge\"ne>ique\nde lucidite.\nNous diviserons la Iucidite en deux classes qui parfois se\nconfondent, parfois se dissocient. A. La luddiU UUpathique.\nB. La liicidiU non t&dpathique.\nLa lucidite telepathique, c'est ce qu'on appelle souvent la\ntransmission ou la suggestion mentale ; autrement dit la con\nnaissance plus ou moins nette par la conscience A des e\"motions\nd'une conscience voisine B, sans qu'il y ait e\"videmment de phe-\nnomene exterieur appreciable qui puisse reveler a A 1'emotion\nde B.\nAu contraire la Iucidite\" non te1e\"pathique s'exerce sur des\nchoses inconnues de toute personne vivante, de sorte que la\nconscience A a connaissance de faits qu'aucun homme ne peut\nconnaitre.\nChacune de ces deux varies de Iucidite peut se produire\nexpe\"rimentalement ou fortuitement.\nMais\u2014ce qui est assurement tres malheureux\u2014la Iuciditt5\nexp<5rimentale est un chapitre beaucoup plus court et beaucoup\nplus incomplet que la lucidite\" fortuite, occasionnelle.\nEvidemment je laisse de c6te ces soi-disaut experiences\nde transmission mentale dans lesquelles il y avait contact :\n\f38 M. Charles Richet. [part\ncomme dans le jeu du Willing game, si r\u00e9pandu dans les salons,\nqui a pass\u00e9 dans les s\u00e9ances de cirque et de caf\u00e9 concert, o\u00f9\nun individu tr\u00e8s na\u00eff tient la main du soi-disant lucide. Dans\nces cas, soit le contact de la main, soit la mani\u00e8re de marcher,\nde respirer, de s'arr\u00eater, soit les interpellations et les physio\nnomies des spectateurs, dirigent la sagacit\u00e9 du voyant bien\nsuffisamment pour qu'il soit inutile d'admettre autre chose\nqu'une habile interpr\u00e9tation des mouvements inconscients.1 Pour\nqu'il y ait vraiment lucidit\u00e9, il faut que nul ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne ext\u00e9\nrieur ne se produise, qui puisse renseigner l'op\u00e9rateur. Par\ncons\u00e9quent il ne faut pas qu'il y ait contact. S'il y a contact,\ntout devient incertain, et je r\u00e9cuse formellement toutes les\nexp\u00e9riences faites devant un auditoire cr\u00e9dule et ignorant, dis\npos\u00e9 par avance \u00e0 admettre les balivernes qu'on va lui pr\u00e9senter.\nAussi, en \u00e9liminant ces tr\u00e8s nombreuses et tr\u00e8s peu\nd\u00e9monstratives exp\u00e9riences, ne restera-t-il que quelques rares\ncomptes rendus o\u00f9 la lucidit\u00e9 exp\u00e9rimentale a pu \u00eatre tant\nbien que mal \u00e9tablie.\nC'est peu. C'est trop peu ! Donc nous devrions faire tous\nnos efforts pour combler cette grave lacune, car la certitude\nexp\u00e9rimentale est d'un ordre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que la certitude em\npirique, et, tant que la lucidit\u00e9 ne sera pas \u00e9tablie par une\nassez longue s\u00e9rie d'exp\u00e9riences m\u00e9thodiques, rigoureuses, devant\ndes observateurs qui gardent un silence et une impassibilit\u00e9\nabsolues, la lucidit\u00e9 restera un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne contestable.\nSi la lucidit\u00e9 exp\u00e9rimentale est incertaine, d'autre part la\nlucidit\u00e9 empiriquement constat\u00e9e parait solidement \u00e9tablie.\nMais il me parait ici n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9ciser en quoi l'empirisme\ndiff\u00e8re de l'exp\u00e9rimentation.\nPrenons l'exemple de la lucidit\u00e9 se r\u00e9v\u00e9lant par le moyen\nde l'\u00e9criture automatique. On sait que certains sujets peuvent\n\u00e9crire des mots, des phrases, parfois m\u00eame de longues pages,\nsans avoir aucune conscience de ce qu'ils \u00e9crivent. Or deux\ncas peuvent se pr\u00e9senter : dans le premier cas une demande\nest faite par les assistants. Ce sera par exemple la question,\nsuivante : quel est le fr\u00e8re de Marguerite ? Si une r\u00e9ponse est\ndonn\u00e9e alors par \u00e9criture automatique, ce sera un cas de\nlucidit\u00e9 exp\u00e9rimentale.\n1 II y a sur ce chapitre int\u00e9ressant de physiologie psychologique toute une\nlitt\u00e9rature abondante qu'il et inutile de mentionner ici.\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsyckique. 39\nDans l'autre cas au contraire on laisse le m\u00e9dium \u00e9crire\nce qu'il veut, sans lui rien demander, et il \u00e9crit. Robert est\nle fr\u00e8re de Marguerite. C'est de la lucidit\u00e9 empirique, car il\nne s'agit pas de donner une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e ;\nmais bien de dire, sans question pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avance, quelque\nchose qui est conforme \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, (et ne peut \u00eatre connu\npar les voies ordinaires de la connaissance).\nOr le plus souvent la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question demand\u00e9e,\nquestion qui exige une r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9cise, n'est pas donn\u00e9e. Le\nplus souvent le m\u00e9dium \u00e9crit, par l'\u00e9criture automatique, des\nphrases qui t\u00e9moignent peut-\u00eatre de sa clairvoyance, mais qui\nportent sur les mati\u00e8res qu'il a choisies lui-m\u00eame, et ne r\u00e9\npondent nullement aux questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9s.\nAssur\u00e9ment, dans un examen, un professeur ne se conten\nterait pas de ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e9vasifs. Un \u00e9tudiant, \u00e0 qui l'on\ndemande : que savez-vous de l'hydrog\u00e8ne ? doit r\u00e9pondre sur\nl'hydrog\u00e8ne. Et les juges seraient mal dispos\u00e9s pour lui, s'il\nleur parlait alors des combinaisons du mercure. Mais il faut\nprobablement traiter les m\u00e9diums autrement que des candidats\nqu'on interroge. Certains \u00e9crits automatiques, quoique ne\nr\u00e9pondant pas aux questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, fournissent des\nt\u00e9moignages \u00e9clatants de lucidit\u00e9. On demande : quel est le\nfr\u00e8re de Marguerite ? Si le m\u00e9dium r\u00e9pond : le grand p\u00e8re de\nMarguerite s'appelait Simon ; ce peut \u00eatre encore une tr\u00e8s\nbonne preuve de lucidit\u00e9 au cas o\u00f9 l'on r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 prouver que\nle nom du grand p\u00e8re de Marguerite a \u00e9t\u00e9 en toute certitude\nabsolument inconnu du m\u00e9dium. Mais, dans ces cas de r\u00e9ponse\n\u00e9vasive, il faut toujours exercer une perspicacit\u00e9 vigilante; car\nla conscience subliminale, si elle peut choisir l'objet de sa\nlucidit\u00e9, va inventer des supercheries qui peuvent prendre une\nextension redoutable.\nL'analyse approfondie devient alors d'une difficult\u00e9 extr\u00eame ;\net toute r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est inapplicable. Chaque cas va exiger\nune \u00e9tude minutieuse, d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, sagace, p\u00e9n\u00e9trante, et c'est en\nd\u00e9sespoir de cause, apr\u00e8s avoir bien \u00e9tabli l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'une\nacquisition par les voies connues, qu'il faudra se r\u00e9signer \u00e0\nadmettre la clairvoyance.\nCombien mille fois serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable une exp\u00e9rience faite\navec un simple jeu des cartes ? mais il semble, h\u00e9las ! que les\nm\u00e9diums\u2014on les forces intelligentes qui les animent\u2014aient\n\f40 M.

C'est un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9, aussi bien\n\u00e9tabli que la chute d'une m\u00e9t\u00e9orite, et malheureusement aussi\ndifficile \u00e0 provoquer \u00e0 point donn\u00e9 par une exp\u00e9rience.\nNous faisons rentrer ces hallucinations v\u00e9ridiques dans les\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de lucidit\u00e9, encore qu'ils en diff\u00e8rent\npar le caract\u00e8re m\u00eame de cette hallucination qui a une apparence\nobjective. Mais, sauf quelques cas, d'interpr\u00e9tation tr\u00e8s difficile,\nil parait bien que ces fant\u00f4mes sont tout \u00e0 fait subjectifs. Ils\nne sont vus que d'une seule personne ; ils ne se fixent pas\nsur la plaque photographique ; ils ne d\u00e9placent pas les objets\next\u00e9rieurs.\nAussi la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 mat\u00e9rielle de ces visions est elle tr\u00e8s\nimprobable.\nPuisque la vision n'est per\u00e7ue que par une seule personne,\nc'est qu'il n'y a pas de mat\u00e9rialisation, pas de lumi\u00e8re, pas de\nfant\u00f4me ... et cependant il y a quelque chose, puisque le\npercipient a connaissance d'un fait r\u00e9el.\nCe quelque chose n'est pas une forme mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9e : cest\nun ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne ext\u00e9rieur, une vibration quelconque, perceptible\n\u00e0 une seule personne, et m\u00eame perceptible suivant une modalit\u00e9\ndont la nature nous est profond\u00e9ment inconnue.\nJe n'ai assur\u00e9ment pas la pr\u00e9tention de la p\u00e9n\u00e9trer. Pourtant\nil est bien permis de se demander pourquoi le percipient voit\nune forme humaine, mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9e, avec chapeau, canne et lorgnon.\nN'est-il pas probable que toute cette objectivit\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par le\npercipient \u00e0 son hallucination est symbolique ? La connaissance\nd'un fait p\u00e9n\u00e8tre dans l'intelligence du percipient. Par\nquelles voies, peu importe : toujours est-il que le percipient a\nconnaissance d'un fait, la mort de A, par exemple, et le fait\nqui soudainement se r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e0 lui se pr\u00e9sente alors aussit\u00f4t\nsous la forme symbolique d'une image.\nCe n'est qu'un symbole, car il n'y a pas de mouvement\nmat\u00e9riel ext\u00e9rieur, perceptible \u00e0 nos sens. Mais la symboli-\nsation est compl\u00e8te, et A apparait alors au percipient avec\nchapeau, canne et lorgnon. Sans doute il ne pourrait com\nprendre A autrement, et il ext\u00e9riorise sa perception int\u00e9rieure,\napr\u00e8s qu'elle s'est produite \u00e0 lui suivant une formule qu'il ne\npeut d\u00e9finir et qu'il est forc\u00e9 de traduire par une image\nvisuelle. Le fait abstrait de la mort de A prend la forme\nd'un fait concret. L'id\u00e9e devient une image visuelle, et le\n\f42 M. Charles Richet. [part\nfant\u00f4me de A, quelque apparente que soit sa forme au per\ncipient, n'est que le symbole d'une perception dont la nature\nest profond\u00e9ment myst\u00e9rieuse.\nCette opinion est d'autant plus vraisemblable que l'halluci\nnation v\u00e9ridique n'est pas toujours visuelle. Elle est souvent\nauditive. Des paroles sont entendues qui r\u00e9v\u00e8lent le fait\nque A est mort, et ces voix sont tout aussi symboliques que\nle fant\u00f4me de A.\nPuisque je vous parle des symboles, je puis vous en rapporter\nici un assez curieux exemple, qui m'est personnel. Dans une\nexp\u00e9rience faite avec un m\u00e9dium, il s'agissait d'un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne\nde clairvoyance : trouver le nom de la personne qui, \u00e0 ce\nmoment pr\u00e9cis, loin du m\u00e9dium m\u00eame, conversait avec moi.\nLe choix du la personne en question fut par moi tir\u00e9 au sort,\nsans que cela p\u00fbt venir, en toute certitude, h, la connaissance\ndu m\u00e9dium, parmi vingt personnes diff\u00e9rentes. Le probabilit\u00e9\n\u00e9tait donc de 1\/20. Or ce jour-l\u00e0 le m\u00e9dium, \u00e9tant seule\nchez elle, vit une forme humaine, bien caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par le nom\nde Henri. Mais, en m\u00eame temps, devant sa porte se tenait\nun h\u00e9raut d'armes, avec hallebarde, souliers \u00e0 rubans, et tricorne\ngalonn\u00e9, emp\u00eachant les autres esprits de venir dans la chambre ;\ncar ils se pr\u00e9cipitaient pour entrer, et il ne fallait pas qu'une\nconfusion s'\u00e9tabl\u00eet entre eux et Henri.\nN'est-il pas \u00e9vident que tout ce petit drame n'a aucune\nr\u00e9alit\u00e9 ; et qu'il n'est qu'un symbole ?\nMais c'est le symbole de quelque chose qui est r\u00e9el, et le\nmyst\u00e8re n'en reste pas moins tout aussi profond, car ce n'est\nni le hasard, ni une excitation pathologique qui provoquent\nde pareils ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes. Ils sont en rapport \u00e9troit avec un\nfait vrai ; ils sont donc v\u00e9ridiqnes, correspondant au danger ou\n\u00e0 la mort de A. La lucidit\u00e9 s'exerce par des voies absoluement\ninconnues de nous : mais le fait d'ignorer ses modalit\u00e9s ne\ndoit pas nous entrainer \u00e0 la nier.\nQuelques uns de nos amis \u00e9mettent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard une opinion\nque je ne puis gu\u00e8re partager. Ils croient que tout est expliqu\u00e9\net simple quand on a dit suggestion mentale, \u00e9motion provoqu\u00e9e\nchez B par une \u00e9motion de A. Les deux consciences vibre\nraient \u00e0 l'unisson, pour ainsi dire, et il suffit que A pense \u00e0\nquelque chose fortement, pour qu'aussit\u00f4t B se forme le m\u00eame\nconcept.\n\fL.] La Mtta\/psychique. 43\nMais, si nous allons au fond des choses, nous verrons que\nla suggestion mentale n'explique rien. C'est un mot commode\nqui masque notre radicale inconnaissance des choses. Qu'on\n1'appelle encore UUpathie, c'est un mot heureux, que je\nsuis tout pret a adopter, a condition qu'on reconnaisse que,\npas plus que suggestion mentale, il ne nous fournit une ex\nplication, me'me approximative, du phenomene. Nos intelli\ngences ne sont pas des miroirs dans lesquelles viennent se\nrefle\"chir les vibrations des intelligences voisines ; et je ne\ncomprends en aucune maniere que les angoisses de 1'agonie,\nfrappant 1'intelligence de A, aillent provoquer 1'image de ce\nmeme A dans 1'intelligence de son ami B, qui sommeille\ntranquillement dans son lit, a vingt kilometres de la maison\nde A. De quelque nom qu'on appelle ce fait, il est myste-\nrieux, ignore\" ; ignore quant a sa cause, ignore quant a son\nessence, ignore\" quant aux conditions de sa production. Et le\nmystere ne me paraitra pas beaucoup plus grand si A peut\nlire sans 1'ouvrir une lettre cachetee que la poste vient de lui\nremettre.\nAutrement dit encore, pour bien fuire saisir ma pensee, ces\nmots de suggestion mentale et de te\"le\"pathie ne nous expli-\nquent absolument rien, de sorte qu'entre la clairvoyance tele-\npathique, et la clairvoyance non te1e\"pathique je ne peux\nvraiment trouver que des nuances. Si les faits relatifs a.\nla clairvoyance tele\"pathique sont beaucoup plus nombreux\nque les faits de clairvoyance non te\"lepathique, c'est, je crois,\nqu'alors 1'erreur est bien plus facile, et que des indications,\nconscientes ou inconscientes, ont ete donne\"es, dans les cas de\nsoi-disant telepathic, par les personnes voisines du percipient.\nMais laissons de cote cette discussion un pen technique, que\nje me reproche presque d'avoir abordee, et revenons aux faits\neux memes, c'est a dire a la lucidite\" envisaged en soi.\nOr, vraiment, apres tous les re\"cits des magnetiseurs d'autre-\nfois, apres les innombrables comptes rendus des journaux\nspirites, apres les faits rapporte\"s dans des ouvrages savants et\nse\"rieux, apres les temoignages historiques et les traditions, il\nme parait impossible de nier que la lucidite cxiste.\nDe meme que, parlant de la me\"tapsychique objective, je\nvous disais que 1'hypothese de forces naturelles et mate\"rielles,\nautres que celles qui sont connues de nous, est necessaire ; de\n\f44 M. Charles Richet. [PART\nmeme, parlant de la metapsychique subjective, je considere\ncomme necessaire cette hypothese qu'il existe d'autres precedes\nde connaissance que ceux qui derivent de nos sensations\nnormales.\nH existe dans la nature des vibrations qui tmeuvent obscurt-\nment nos consciences infe\"rieures, ct qui nous rMlent des fails\nque les sens normaux sont impuissants a nous apprendre.\nQue certains individus, les mediums, soient plus que les\nautres humains capables de percevoir ces vibrations, cela\nme parait tout a fait certain, mais j'ai peine a croire qu'entre\nles mediums et les autres mortels il n'y ait pas de transi\ntions. II est bien vraisemblable au contraire que tout etre\nhumain est (plus ou moins) capable de lucidite\". En eft'et, si\nles uns et les autres nous interrogeons nos souvenirs, nous\ntrouverons dans notre existence des vestiges de cette extra\nordinaire et mysterieuse puissance intellectuelle. Qui de nous\nn'a pas etc surpris d'apercevoir soudain au de\"tour d'une rue\nune personne a qui nous venions de penser avec force, que\nnous ne rencontrons jamais d'habitude, et a qui nous ue\nsongeons pas deux fois 1'an ? Je veux bien que de tels\nre\"cits soient presque toujours trop vagues, trop informes, pour\nmeriter d'etre publics ; mais pourtant ils ont leur importance,\npar leur multiplicite meme, et ils semblent nous prouver que\nnous avons tous quelque parcelle de lucidite ; et qu'il faut\nfaire une part (grande ou petite) dans notre existence intellec\ntuelle a ces vibrations inconnues agissant sur notre conscience.\nA ces vibrations inconnues il faut probablement joindre les\ncurieux phenomenes connus sous le nom de baguette divina-\ntoire. N'ayant pas d'expe\"rience personnelle k ce sujet, je m'en\nreTere, aux beaux travaux, de si habile et savante critique,\nqu'a publies M. Barrett.\nAlais je ne puis m'etendre, comme je le voudrais, sur ce\nvaste sujet, et j'arrive aux autres phenomenes subjectifs.\n(2) Personnifications.\nJ'emprunte ce terme, qui me parait excellent, k J. Maxwell,\nencore que les personnifications, telles qu'elles ont ete\" decrites\npar lui et par d'autres, puissent etre a la rigueur considerees\ncomme des varietes de lucidite. Ai-je besoin de vous dire\nqu'il vient d'exposer ses idees et ses belles experiences a ce\n,\n\fL.] La M&apsychique. 45\nsujet dans un livre dont la traduction anglaise va paraitre\ndans quelques jours ?\nCette Iucidite avec personnification a un caractcre tout a,\nfait special. La personnalite du medium disparait, ou semble\ndisparaitre. Elle est remplace\"e par un autre personnage qui\nentre en scene, parle par la voix du medium, e\"crit par la main\ndu medium, donne des raps, en s'affirmant comme une entite\ndistincte. Le type de ces cas de personnification, c'est le cas\nde Mme Piper, si bien etudie par les membres les plus e\"minents\nde cette socie\"te\\ entre autres par mon illustre ami, Sir Oliver\nLodge. Mme Piper n'est plus la; mais c'est George Pelham\nqui parle, pense et agit a sa place.\nXotre savant collegue M. Flournoy a fait un re\"cit pittoresque\net instructif d'un beau phenomene de ce genre, etudie\" par lui\navec une extreme perspicacite.\nDans les experiences de Stainton Moses, apparaissent des per-\nsonnages, des guides ; Rector, Imperator, et d'autres encore, qui\nont tout a fait les allures d'etres intelligents, avec uue volonte,\nune conscience, un langage, des gouts, qui leurs sont propres.\nSouvent aussi, dans les experiences de typtologie, des raps\nannoncent 1'arrive\"e de tel ou tel personnage, qui se nomme,\nse caracte>ise plus ou moins, et prend place parmi les assistants,\nainsi qu'une personne humaine re\"elle, affirmant ses sympathies,\nses desirs, ses haines, posse\"dant son style original, manifestant\ntout ce qui est caracte>istique d'une personnalite humaine\nnettement determined.\nLa premiere idee, tres simple, qui se pre\"sente alors, est de\ncroire a la realite de ces personnages; car la bonne foi des\nmediums est certaine, et toute 1'adaptation de leur e\"tre au\nnouveau persounage apparu est d'une saisissante exactitude.\nMais il faut bien se rappeler que, dans certains e\"tats de\n1'hypnose, il se produit des changements de personnalite\" tout a\nfait analogues, avec des apparences de ve\"racite\" au moins aussi\neclatantes. Pourtant, dans les personnifications hypnotiques,\nil est bien e\"vident qu'aucune personnalite etrangere n'inter-\nvient, et que tous les phenomenes ne sont que des adaptations\nd'une seule et me'me intelligence humaine.\nJe me demande alors si ces personnifications, qui jouent\nttn si grand role dans le spiritisme, ne seraient pas des\nphenomenes du me'me genre.\n\f46 M. Charles Richet. [part\nSupposons un changement de personnalit\u00e9 (comme dans les\ncas d'hypnotisme) avec une certaine dose de lucidit\u00e9, et alors\nnous assisterons aux ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9tranges de Mme\nPiper par exemple, qui, \u00e9tant devenue George Pelham, connait\nles amis, les parents, de ce m\u00eame Pelham, pense et parle\nexactement comme il e\u00fbt parl\u00e9 et pens\u00e9, s'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0.\nC'est une hypoth\u00e8se un peu compliqu\u00e9e sans doute. Mais\ncroit-on que l'autre hypoth\u00e8se, celle de la survivance de George\nPelham, venant, trois ans apr\u00e8s qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 enseveli et putr\u00e9fi\u00e9,\ns'incorporer dans les cellules nerveuses de Mme Piper, soit une\nconception simple et pleinement satisfaisante ?\nIle ne nous suffira donc pas qu'on nous dise . . . je suis\nJohn King . . . je suis Chappe . . . pour que nous pensions\navoir affaire \u00e0 la conscience de d\u00e9funt John King ou de d\u00e9funt\nChappe. Je ne vois m\u00eame pas bien encore comment John\nKing et Chappe, \u00e0 supposer qu'il s'agisse vraiment d'eux,\npourraient nous prouver en tonte rigueur leur existence parmi\nnous ; car, m\u00eame s'ils nous adressent par des messages des\nparoles qu'eux seuls peuvent transmettre, l'hypoth\u00e8se de la\nlucidit\u00e9 est une porte ouverte \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente.\nEvidemment, dans ce rapide aper\u00e7u je ne peux pr\u00e9tendre\n\u00e0 trancher la question. Je vous signale seulement son im\nportance. Car une des bases de la th\u00e9orie spirite, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9\nment cette croyance \u00e0 des entit\u00e9s humaines, survivantes,\nrevenant sur notre plan\u00e8te, dans notre monde terrestre, et\naffirmant leur personnalit\u00e9.\n(3) Langages \u00e9trangers.\nLes deux derniers chapitres de la m\u00e9tapsychique subjective\nse rapportent aux langages \u00e9trangers et aux pr\u00e9monitions.\nDes langages \u00e9trangers, je n'ai que peu de chose \u00e0 dire,\ncar on ne trouve que des bribes de documents \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard\ndans les livres. Cependant j'ai eu l'occasiou d'assister \u00e0 un\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne remarquable de ce genre, et peut-\u00eatre quelque\njour aurai-je l'occasion de publier des phrases, m\u00eame des\npages, qu'a \u00e9crites un m\u00e9dium qui ignore absolument le grec.\nMais la discussion d'un tel ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne doit \u00eatre tr\u00e8s appro\nfondie.\n(4) Pr\u00e9monitions.\nDe m\u00eame pour ce qui concerne les pr\u00e9monitions.

II ne s'agit pas de savoir si un fait trouble\nnotre conception de 1'univers, car notre conception de 1'univers\nest terriblement enfautine. La discussion doit s'engager sur\non terrain tout autre, et on aura a examiner s'il existe,\ncomme je serais tente par ma propre experience de le croire,\ndes faits anthentiques de premonition.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS.\nMe voici arrive au terme de cette longue enumeration, que\nj'aurais bien voulu rendre plus courte, plus attrayante surtout.\nMais on a fait tant de recherches, on a agite tant de ques\ntions, que nous serions inexcusable^ de passer sous silence\ntout cet immense labour accompli.\nSi grand qu'il ait ete, il est bien moindre encore que\ncelui qui reste a accomplir. En effet, comme vous avez pu le\nconstater, bien rares sont les phenomenes de metapsychique\npour lesquels tous les doutes ont ete victorieusement dissipes,\net c'est a peine si nous pouvons conserver comme definitive-\nment acquis deux ou trois phenomenes elementaires, les raps\nsans contact, par exemple, et les hallucinations veridiques.\nEncore ces faits memes, quoiqu'ils nous paraissent assez bien\nprouves, n'ont-ils pas jusque a present penetre dans la science\nofficielle classique, de sorte qu'il nous faudra de grands efforts\npour leur donner droit de cite.\nVoila pourquoi, n'etant pas assures des faits, nous avons ete\nsi reserves sur les theories.\nCe n'est pas que des theories tres vastes n'aient ete emises.\nMais elles me paraissent toutes d'une cruelle insuffisance.\nNous avons vu qu'il parait vraisemblable que des forces\ninconnues agissent soit sur la matiere, pour provoquer certains\nphenomenes materials, soit sur 1'intelligence humaine pour\ndonner la lucidite.\nFaire la theorie de ces phenomenes materiels et de cette\n\f48 M. Charles Richet. [PART\nciditd', c'est chercher en quoi consistent les forces qui leur\ndonnent naissance.\nDeux hypotheses se presentent tout de suite a nous. Ces\nforces inconnues sont humaines ou extra-humaines.\n(a) Si elles sont humaines, il faudrait alors supposer a\nnotre organisme nerveux la puissance de s'exterioriser par des\nmouvements sans contact (telekinesie), et la puissance de\npercevoir des phe\"nomenes exte\"rieurs que nos sensations ordinaires\nne nous ri5velent pas (clairvoyance).\n(\/3) Si cea forces sont extra-humaines, il faut supposer qu'il\nexiste dans 1'univers des forces intelligentes pouvant interft'Ter\ndans les choses de notre monde terrestre, mouvoir des objets et\nagir sur notre pense\"e. Cette hypothese comporte elle meme\ndeux sous-hypotheses bien distinctes selon que ces forces\nextra-humaines sont (ft1) des etres (intelligents) completement\ndifftrents de 1'homme ou (\/3\") des consciences d'hommes ayant\nve\"cu.\nAutrement dit ces forces sont soit des ge'nies, des Sainoves,\ndes e\"1e\"mentaux, des anges, pouvant communiquer avec les\nhommes ; soit des ames humaines ayant quitte le corps, et\npoursuivant leur existence psychique apres la decomposition\ndu corps.\nC'est cette derni^re theorie, tres simple, qui est celle des\nspirites ; et il est inutile d'insister pour montrer qu'elle souleve\nde terribles objections.\nQuant a, la theorie qui admet 1'existence d'etres intelli\ngents completement diff^rents de 1'homme, elle n'est guere\ndeTendue que par les the\"ologiens pour des raisons qui ne sont\npas d'ordre experimental.\nReste la thcorie qui attribue tout a des forces humaines :\nelle est peu se\"duisante, et elle ne s'appuie sur aucune preuve\nsolide.\nNous voici done en face de trois theories egalement invrai-\nsemblables et irrationnelles, ce qui nous permettra sans doute\nd'en proposer une autre.\nMais rassurez vous tout de suite. Elle ne sera ni longue\na exposer, ni difficile k comprendre ; car cette nouvelle theorie,\nexplicative des phenomenes, je ne la saurais formuler, ne la\nconnaissant pas, ne prevoyant meme pas ce qu'elle peut etre.\nC'est une theorie x que 1'avenir nous revelera.\n\fL.] La M\u00e9tapsychique. 49\nOui ! je crois bieii que, dans un temps tr\u00e8s prochain, apr\u00e8s\nque de nouveaux faits seront constat\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s que d'habiles\nexp\u00e9rimentateurs, aid\u00e9s par de puissants m\u00e9diums, auront mis\nen lumi\u00e8re des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes qui sont encore t\u00e9n\u00e9breux, nous\nserons amen\u00e9s \u00e0 modifier si profond\u00e9ment toutes nos conceptions\nsur la m\u00e9tapsychique que nous aurons d'autres hypoth\u00e8ses \u00e0\nformuler que celle des anges, des esprits, ou des effluves humains.\nCette th\u00e9orie x, inconnue, qui est inattaquable puisqu'on\nne la formule pas, a toute chance d'\u00eatre vraie, aussi vraie que\nla th\u00e9orie de la s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait vraie avant Darwin, que la\nth\u00e9orie de K\u00e9pler \u00e9tait vraie avant K\u00e9pler, que la th\u00e9orie\nchimique \u00e9tait vraie avant Lavoisier, que la th\u00e9orie de l'\u00e9lectri\ncit\u00e9 \u00e9tait vraie avant Amp\u00e8re, Faraday, Maxwell et Hertz.\nAvant que les d\u00e9couvertes fondamentales de ces sciences\neussent \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, on n'avait \u00e9mis que des th\u00e9ories absurdes,\n(comme la th\u00e9orie du phlogistique, par exemple, ou la th\u00e9orie\ng\u00e9ocentrique).

Taylor.\nI have been asked to write a short paper on some of the\ncurious and abnormal things I have witnessed during the\ntime I have interested myself in the investigation of pheno\nmena claimed by Spiritualists, not only to be evidence for,\nbut to have proved the existence among us of discarnate\nhuman beings able to communicate.\nThe conditions under which these Spiritualistic phenomena\noccur are so mysterious and little understood that many\ninvestigators are unable to appreciate their bearing on the\nfacts observed, and, judging rather by what they think they\nshould be than by what they are, attribute fraud to mediums\nwhen, in reality, only a misunderstanding exists, on our part,\nof the conditions necessary for the production of the mani\nfestations.\nThe phenomena above alluded to are of various kinds, but\nare frequently divided into two classes, namely :\n(I.) Psychical phenomena, including clairvoyance, automatic\nwriting and speaking, psychometry, pre- and retro-cognition,\netc., and\n(II.) Physical phenomena ranging from the spontaneous\nmovement of ponderable objects to \" spirit lights \" and material\nisations.\nIn. the first class there need be no evidence of interference\nwith physical laws as accepted by science; in the second,\nno indication of intelligent purpose. But there is a\n(III..) Third class, the largest of all, in which purposive\nhumanlike intelligence manifests itself in intimate connection\nwith abnormal physical phenomena of every kind. Of this\nclass, what is called \" direct writing \" is the best example.\n\fL.] Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 51\nI think there has been an unfortunate tendency to discuss\nthese classes of phenomena too much by compartments ; I\nmean, to discuss psychical phenomena without. mentioning the\naccompanying physical manifestations and to lose sight of the\nseemingly purposive direction given when physical phenomena\nare under discussion.\nI will try to illustrate the three classes I have mentioned\nby describing half-a-dozen incidents, two of which will, I\nthink, fall into each class. I shall not attempt to support\nwhat I am about to relate by bringing forward any evidence\nother than a statement of my own personal experience. I\nhave always made notes of what I have witnessed as soon\nas possible, nearly always within 12 or 14 hours of the\noccurrence.\nI will begin with the cases in which the least amount of intel\nligence seems involved, and in which the phenomena observed\nmight be the result of some obscure natural law set in motion\nunwittingly by the sitters. Yet even in these cases, though\nthe physical occurrences do not in themselves show purposive\ndirection, they always occur concurrently and contemporaneously\nwith what looks like intelligent effort and are quite similar\nto other phenomena which are found to be intimately con\nnected with, and directed by, a humanlike intelligence.\nThroughout this paper, except in the one instance indicated,\nI use fictitious names, but the real names of the persons re\nferred to are known to the Editor.\nOn the evening of November 25th, 1886, I visited the house\nof a Mrs. Beasley, in Hammersmith, to witness some physical\nphenomena said to take place through the mediumship of her\nservant, a young girl. The following are the notes I made\nat the time, word for word as they were written.\n... I found her, her sister Miss S., a Mr. G., who had been at\nthe second sitting, and another young man sitting round the fire in\nbright lamp light. The ladies corroborated by word of mouth what\nI had been told in the letters, and Mr. G. confirmed the statements\nas far as he was concerned. After a few minutes we proposed to\nbegin. We arranged the room as follows [see Fig. I.] : Mrs. B.\nand others took the ornaments off a small table 3 ft. x 1| ft. which\nwas standing against the wall and placed it in front of the sofa.\nSome one brought up two chairs and placed them at the table, I\n\f52 Lieut-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [part\nbrought two others which I carefully examined for attachments,\netc., and placed one at the end of the table nearest the door and\none on its right at an end of one of the long sides. These were\nthe two chairs which were afterwards moved. We placed in\nvarious known parts of the room things in which we hoped to\nget raps, and also a chair in the centre of the room clear of every\nthing.\nMrs. B. rang the bell for the medium and meeting her at the\ndoor conducted her at once to her seat at the end of the table.\nWe all sat down in the order shown below. The two gentlemen\nseemed quite as keen as I was to examine things. Soon after we\nsat down, the table began to rock and some faint taps appeared to\nbe made on the floor.\nWe now put out the lamps, but the light from the fire and the\nstreet lamp just opposite the window made the room so light that\nwe could see everything and, when our eyes got accustomed to the\nsemi-darkness, each other's features and hands. [I mean that at first\nwe could see the outline of things distinctly and later on the details\nof the hands and faces.] . . .\nAfter this the chairs and things began to be moved. The chairs\non which Miss S. and the medium sat were several times slowly\nmoved away from the table with the sitters on them, sometimes\nat the same moment and sometimes not. When the sitters found\nthat they could no longer keep their hands on the table, they got\nup and took a step forward ; the chairs, however, quietly continued\ntheir movement without quickening it till they rested at points\nfrom 4 to 8 feet from the table, and after a pause returned at the\nsame pace to their places, when the sitters again sat down. The\nmedium's chair did not always move away and return in a straight\nline ; once it moved as in Fig. II., stopped and had to be brought\nback again by hand, and once as in Fig. III. it returned of itself,\nfollowing the direction of the dotted line.\nThese movements of the chairs must have taken place at least\neight times, midst exclamations of astonishment from all of us, one\nand another standing up to see better. . . .\nI saw the chair in the middle of the room move towards the\nfire-place and fall down. . . .\n[The manifestations now began to be rough.] We now thought\nthings were going too far, so Miss S. got up to light the candle\nand while she was at the fireplace her chair again moved away\nfrom the table as it had done before. . . .\n\fScale 6pr. in\nM\nM,\nm\nSca7e4-Rf-\/\/T\n\fFIC. IV.\n\fJj.\\ Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 53\nWe broke up about 11 p.m. after a most astonishing and satisfac\ntory seance.\nIn common with the two young men I examined the room and\nthe chairs when the lamp was re-lighted\u2014we found nothing of a\nsuspicious nature.\nI need hardly say that no one was near the chair in the\nmiddle of the room when it moved and fell over, nor had\nany one approached it since it was placed there.\nThe lady in whose house this happened I knew well ;\nshe had no motive for perpetrating a fraud and was actuated\nalone by her great interest in the matter, and the medium\nhad no opportunity whatever of making arrangements to act\nfraudulently.\nWithout referring to the difficulty of causing the chair in\nthe middle of the room to move in the direction it did and\nto fall over by fraudulent means, I would call attention to the\ncomplicated nature of any appliances necessary to make the\nmedium's chair move as I have stated it did, and as shown\nin Fig. III. These must have been of a nature either to\npush it or to pull it. If they were to push it, a rigid rod\nseveral feet long would have been required, and even this\nwould hardly have been adequate. I need hardly say\nthat no such rod was used. If we try to consider how\nstrings could be applied to cause the motion, we shall find\nthat four separate strings would have to be fastened to\nthe chair, one to pass over a pulley at c, another over one\nat d, and two others which, by being pulled in a sufficiently\ndivergent direction, might cause the irregular path of the\nchair's return.\nI would rather, of course, confine myself to cases observed\nin the light, but as now I want to quote the case of a so-\ncalled \" Spirit Light,\" we must be content with darkness.\nI again quote from my notes verbatim.\nOn August 8th, 1888, Mrs. Marriett kindly came into town and\ngave a seance at the L.S.A. rooms. [It was a dark stance, abso\nlutely no light.] The lights [I mean the spirit lights that I saw]\nwere such as could not have been made by ordinary means. Their\nappearance, colour, illuminating power, etc., were such that I have\nnever seen the like except at stances. They moved rapidly about\n\f54 Lieut-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [part\nand were sometimes in a part of the room most remote from the\nsitters.\nFor example. Mrs. Marriett sat at the end of an oblong table,\non her left Mrs. G. [this, I think, was the lady's name], then\nMr. Davis, and then I came along the longer side of the table\nwith our backs to the entrance door.\nDuring the proceedings Mrs. M. said, \"I think a little light is\ncoming in under the door. Will you, Mr. Davis, kindly push the\nmat against the door to stop it ? \" Mr. D. got up to do so and\njust as he left his chair a light about the shape and size of the\nflame of a candle came down from a point about 5 ft. above and\n3 ft. to the right of the medium and seemed to settle on the table\nin front of his chair. Knowing that he was away and that I\nshould not touch any one I slowly and very silently stretched out\nmy hand towards the light as one sees a boy do who wants to\ncatch a butterfly [see Fig. IV.] The light did not move till my\nfingers had nearly closed round it, then it elongated itself and\nslipped out between my first finger and thumb, re-took its shape\nand floated away to my left, passing quite beyond the circle and\ndisappearing near the ceiling. I made no remark at the time and\nno notice was apparently taken of my action by any one.\nIn common with other spirit lights that I have seen, this light\nseemed to me not to illuminate things as much as a common light of\nequal brilliancy would do, but perhaps a very feeble light, when looked\nat after the eye has been some time in total darkness, may give an\nexaggerated impression of brightness. I felt no heat when the\nlight was in my hand, nor did I feel the touch of anything.\n\u2666\nAs they stand, the two cases quoted show no evidence\nthat human or other intelligence had anything to do with\nthem, except that they occurred in the midst of other\nphenomena which obviously had an intelligent origin.\nMy next two cases bring the abnormal physical disturb\nances into closer relationship with intelligence.\nIt was in 1885, and I was without much experience, but\nall the more suspicious and all the more careful to guard\nagainst fraud.\nWe had had a very interesting dark seance at the house of\nMr. Davis. I now quote from my notes :\nThe seance terminated. . . . Soon we went in to supper, and I\n\fL.] Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 55\ntook in Mrs. Harriett [who was the medium]. We went in first,\nand I chose which chairs we should sit on. As soon as we sat\ndown I was again touched on the knee by something, not as far as\nI could see by Mrs. M. Then knocks were heard in different parts\nof the room, and Mrs. Fuller declared they came also on her\nchair. Immediately after they sounded on mine, and I distinctly\nfelt the vibrations caused by them. I pushed my chair away from\nthe table so as to be quite clear of every one and about a yard\nfrom Mrs. M., and no nearer any one else. The raps came on the\nseat of my chair underneath, and I again heard them distinctly and\nfelt the vibrations. I put my hand on the place where a rap had\nbeen given a moment before, and a new rap was at once made on\nsome other part of the seat underneath. This was repeated several\ntimes. Then I said, \" Knock on this arm \" (it was what I believe\nis called a carving chair, with arms), indicating one by placing my\nhand on it. The rap was made. \"On the other arm,\" placing a\nhand on the other arm. A rap was made at once, felt and heard as\nthough on the part of the chair indicated. The room was brightly\nlighted, and I looked closely that there was a clear space round me.\nMr. Davis said, \"It must be some one wanting to communicate\nwith you. Ask mental questions.\"\nI did so, asking in mind :\n\" Are you my wife ? \" At once one rap was given signifying \" No.\"\n\"Is it my father?\" \"No.\"\nThen aloud: \"Is it a woman?\" \"No.\" \"Is it a man?\" \"No.\"\n\"Is it a child?\" \"Yes.\" (Three raps.)\nAfter a pause to think who it would be, I asked, this time\nmentally :\n\"Is it my brother?\" \"No.\"\n\"Is it my child?\" \"No.\"\nI could not think of any one, but noticed that raps at once fol\nlowed my mental questions the moment I formed them\u2014a moment\nwhich could not have been known by any one present; indeed they\nwere all very busy eating their supper, and seemingly taking very\nlittle notice of what I was doing. Mrs. F., who was sitting opposite\nto me at table, and who was taking some interest in what was\ngoing on, said, \"Let me guess.\" After a second or two three raps\nwere given (I have not noted whether these raps were given on her\nchair or mine, and I don't remember). I asked her who she had\nthought of. She answered, \" Young King.\" I said aloud, \" Is it\nyoung King ? \" and three raps came on my chair as before. \" Will\n\f56 Lieut.-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [PART\nyou attend our stance at Sandhurst?\" \"Yes.\" \"Will you be able\nto communicate?\" \"I don't know\" (two raps). \"Will you try?\"\n\" Yes.\" Then I said, \" I will repeat the alphabet ; please give a\nknock at the letters of your name.\" I went over the alphabet\naloud. When O was reached a few light hurried taps came, but I\ntook no notice, and they were repeated when I came to X. Mr. D.\nsaid I had repeated the letters too fast. If the boy was there it\nmust have all been as new to him as to me, and I can quite\nunderstand his blundering over the alphabet way of communicating.\nHere some mind must have directed the knocks on my\nchair, and timed them to my mental questions. My failure\nto get a name was due, I think, to inexperience, and the\nfact that at the time I had strongly in my mind, by mistake,\nthe name of the communicator's brother, which also perhaps\nimpaired the result.\n\" Young King \" was the son of a friend of mine who had\nmet with a fatal accident a few months before.\nI remember that before I resumed my place at table I\nturned the chair upside down to look for possible electric\nconnections, but reflecting that I had myself placed the chair\nwhere it stood, I saw that I could not attribute the knocks\nthat I had heard and felt to transmitted electricity. I\nremember also wishing the chair was mine, so that I could\ntake it into little bits.\nHere is another case in which raps, themselves of abnormal\norigin, answered questions in such a way as to display intelligence.\nIn August, 1899, two ladies [whom I will call Mrs. and Miss\nHope] and I had a syance in one of the rooms of my house in\nCheltenham, which has a large window facing westward. The plan\nof the room and the arrangement of the furniture is shown in\nFig. V.\nJust before sitting down, I placed a zither on a small table at\nx near the lamp, but a few minutes after we were seated, thinking\nthere would be too much light upon it, I shifted it and the table to\na place behind the medium, with a black double table with books on\nit between them. No arrangement was made as to how the zither\nshould be used, and neither of my companions had anything to say\nto the place [where] I first put the instrument, or the place I finally\nifted it to. [Towards the middle of the se\"ance I asked the spirit]\n\fScal\nV.\n\f\fL.] Report cm Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 57\n\" Do you wish the light put out 1 \"\n\"Yes.\" [Three raps on the table.]\nRaps now came on the table behind Miss Hope and on the table\nbehind that, the one on which the zither rested, as well as on the\ninstrument itself. These knocks answered questions and \" they \"\ntried to knock where requested, but the \" boy \" [the communicator\nconcerned] said he could not, or rather that he feared to twang\none of the strings of the instrument.\nIn connection with this part of the seance I wish to describe\none moment about which I am clear.\nThe position of things in the room was still as shown on Fig.\nV. The lamp was out but I could see Miss Hope's movements,\nif any, because she was between me and the blind facing a western\nsky in which, though it was 9.45 P.M., there was still some light\nremaining [See Fig. VII.].\nMrs. Hope asks a question which is answered at once by three\nknocks on the wood of the zither (the knocks being of the same\nspeed and semi-softness of sound as those previously heard).\n(A) I did not make those knocks.\n(B) Mrs. Hope could not have made them.\n(1st) Because the answer came too quickly after her question\nto give her time to go round me and knock.\n(2nd) Because I am sure she did not move from her chair.\n(C) Miss Hope did not make them.\n(1st) Because they were made out of her reach.\n(2nd) Because I watched her and she did not move when the\nknocks were sounding.\n(D) Miss Hope did not make them by means of a stick or any\nthing. Because she did not turn round when I was placing\nthe table with the zither on it behind her, and consequently\ncould not tell its exact position, yet each of the 35 or more\nraps which were [now and at other times] given on the\ninstrument was given clearly and promptly with no bung\nling, never once touching a string, \" the boy \" having said\nhe would not do so.\nI went about the room next day and rapped on all sorts of\nthings, both with my finger and with the end of a stick which I had\nprepared for the purpose of making, as far as possible, the same\nsort of sound [as we had experienced], but found that rapping on\nthe zither gave the only sound which approached that heard the\nevening before. The three raps took about H seconds to complete.\n\f58 Lieut-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [part\nThe arrangement of the table behind the medium is shown in\nsection on a larger scale in Fig. VI. I carefully made measurements\nand believe that the figure is correct to 2 inches as greatest error.\nThe cross marks the furthest point I could reach with my hand\nwhen sitting in the chair half turning round and stretching over.\nIt will be noticed that I do not in the picture (Fig. VII.)\nshow Mrs. Hope's hands on the table, because I want to re\npresent only what I saw at the instant of time about which I\nam speaking. A moment before I had seen them resting on\nthe table, and a moment after I again saw the\"m in the same\nplace. I was observing to the best of my ability and am\nsure, by ear, that the question Mrs. Hope asked came from\nmy immediate left, and that she did not move from her chair,\nand this is an additional reason in my mind to that stated\njust now, that she could not have been concerned with the\nproduction of the raps.\nI now go on to two cases of the psychical class, in both\nof which a communicator claiming to be the discarnate spirit\nof a human being spoke through an entranced medium and\ntruthfully related facts' in a way I do not think can be\nexplained by any theory of telepathy between the medium\nand another ordinary human being, without unreasonably\nstraining the hypothesis.\nIn the first case the communication was made through the\npaid medium Mr. Peters (I give the real name in this case),\nand he is the only paid medium connected with the incidents\ndescribed in this paper.\nIn March, 1S99, I made arrangements with Mr. Peters for\ntwo sittings at the S. P. R. Eooms, then in Buckingham Street.\nThe medium was entranced and spoken through automatically\nin the usual way, but was also used to supplement, by gestures\nand mannerisms, what was said. I now quote from my notes :\nIn my case \" Moonstone \" said, ...\" There is a lady for you,\nshe is small, fair, oval-faced, good teeth, eyebrows scarcely visible.\"\nThis description, as far as it goes, fits my wife, except, perhaps,\nthe teeth, which, in her case, though perfectly good and sound, were\nnot quite regular.\nThe control now changed, and \" Redfeather \" endeavoured to\n\fL.] Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 59\nprocure recognition for the communicator. He said, \"She says\nyou have a picture of her on glass, two of them, they are in a\nbox.\" He described the photograph, the position of the sitter, the\ndress, etc., going so far as to sit on a chair in the position taken\nin the photograph, one to some extent peculiar in that the arms\nwere crossed in the lap, so that each elbow may be touched by the\nopposite hand.\nAt the seance I could think of no picture on glass in my\npossession, and it was not till more than a week after that\nI remembered \"-that I had somewhere a photograph of my wife\nwhich I took in 1874 on glass. I looked about for it and\nat last discovered it in a small tin box in my bedroom ; it\nwas wrapped in paper, and just as I was unfolding this, my\neye caught sight of a similar parcel in the box ; on examining\nthis, I found it to be the original negative, the existence of\nwhich had quite passed from my memory.\nThe position of the sitter in these photographs is quite\nthe same as that taken up by the medium at the stance\nunder Redfeather's control, but I could form no mental\npicture of the dress from the medium's description. So I\nsent the photographs to Mrs. Hope, who had been present at\nthe se\"ance, for her opinion. She says in answer to my letter:\nAbout the photograph there is a great deal that was correct\nin the description ; the attitude with the hands folded across\nwas exactly what he endeavoured to show. Description of the\nhands correct, cuffs correct, the \"something\" down the front of the\nbodice, which he tried to explain, is certainly in the picture,\nand the brooch ; did he say earrings ? I don't remember, but I\nthought so.\nThe one thing wrong that I can think of was a hair net; was\nthat suggested or stated by him in the description ? I do not know,\nbut if given by him it was not correct, but somehow I cannot\nhelp thinking that this is the picture indicated by the clairvoyant.\nIn this case, if telepathy from my sub-consciousness to the\nmedium is the explanation, it is curious that of all the\nmillions of facts which, under the circumstances, my sub\nconscious mind must be supposed to contain, this appropriate\none should have projected itself. How was the selection\nmade ? Not by any conscious effort of mine.\n\f60 Lieut.-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [PART\nThat the impression received by the medium must have\ncome from my mind, if from that of any one present, is certain,\nfor none of the sitters knew my wife, or had ever seen her.\nShe had passed over 16 years previously and no one in the\nworld but myself knew anything whatever about the photo\ngraphs.\nThe probability of the statement being correct by chance\nalone is so remote that it may be neglected.\nTo my mind this incident is not only evidence of extra-\nmundane agency, but points strongly in the direction of\nidentity.\nThe final case I will quote is one which occurred lately.\nSitting on February 20th, 1904, in my house at Cheltenham a\ncommunicator calling herself my wife said, through the en\ntranced medium :\n\" Why is Edie always talking about people not doing\nenough to help her ? She is very anxious just now, but I\ncan't see exactly why it is. . . .\"\nBy Edie I knew she meant her sister in Toronto, so I\nwrote to my niece Adele, \" Edie's \" daughter, to ask if any\nthing had happened to which this might refer. Her answer is:\nP.S.\u2014In just talking the subject over with the girls it suddenly\nstruck us that on Friday night, 19th of March [February], there\nwas a general meeting of the \"Daughters of the Empire,\" at which\nmother was to be in the chair and speak, etc. On arriving at the\nhall she was very much put out, because none of the committee\nwould go on the platform with her to support her, and also as they\nhad not provided a programme of proceedings. I wonder if this\ncould have been what was meant ? She certainly was annoyed.\nof\n,\ntic\nev The se\"ance was held on February 20th, and it was only the\nday before that my sister-in-law was annoyed as reported.\nThe 19th of March in my niece's letter is a mistake for 19th\nof February, because her letter is dated March 13th. March\n19th was not a Friday, whereas February 19th was.\nIn the previous case it may be surmised that the informa\ntion given by the medium was in my unconscious mind, how-\n\u2022er little I was aware of it. But in this case\u2014assuming the\n\u2022mount of correspondence between the medium's statement and\n\fL.] Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 61\nthe facts to be beyond what can be attributed to chance\u2014we\nhave to consider that no one in the neighbourhood was aware\nconsciously or otherwise of the facts related, so that unless my\nsister-in-law at the other end of the world, or one of her\ndaughters, is taken to be the agent, the telepathic explanation\nmust be abandoned.\nIf it is maintained that she was the agent, then the dis\ntance from here to Toronto makes it difficult to believe that\na \" telepathic impulse \" is any sort of physical radiation ; but\nif telepathy is a psychical influence exercised by one mind\nor spirit on another in a way we are wholly ignorant of, pro\nbably independent of time, space, and \" natural law \"\u2014the\nlanguage of the angels\u2014then the truth-telling information\nreceived by us on the night of the 20th of February last\nmight have been acquired telepathically by the sub-conscious\nness of the entranced medium, either from my sister-in-law\nherself or from some discarnate spirit.\nOr, as I think more likely, it was a bit of information with\ndifficulty acquired, and with difficulty expressed, imparted to\nus by my wife when in \" control \" of the medium's organisa\ntion, as an effort towards proving her own identity.\n\f62 Ei'neitt Dunbar. [PART\nIII.\nTHE LIGHT THROWN ON PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES\nBY THE ACTION OF DRUGS.\nBY ERNEST DUNBAR.\nPSYCHOLOGY, like every branch of science, must consist largely\nin establishing constants and should never under any circum\nstances attempt to generalise from variables. The psychological\nexperiment par excellence must consist firstly in a correct\nappreciation of the conditions at the commencement of the\nexperiment ; and secondly, in an equally careful analysis of\nthe steps by which the final stage of the experiment is\nreached. It is because I believe the actions of drugs on the\nmind offer an opportunity for applying scientific methods\nthat I have taken the opportunity of bringing forward the\nsubject before the Society.\nThose drugs which influence the mind, if taken in sufficient\nquantity, abolish consciousness: but before this happens a\nvariety of incidental effects are produced, according to the\nnature of the drug that has been taken. Some of these\neffects are constant and occur in all individuals ; others vary\nwith the peculiar mental characteristics of the individual.\nIn either case a careful study of the effects would, of neces\nsity, throw some light on psychology.\nThe mere fact that mental processes can be so intiuenced\nis noteworthy, and part of the problem must be to find out\nwhether the changes are radical and complete, or whether\nthere is not some thread of an unchangeable nature connect\ning a normal condition with an abnormal one.\nMany drugs exercise so slow and gradual an action that\nit is possible to follow step by step this supplanting of normal\nprocesses by those which are abnormal. Where the difficulty\nof the personal equation is most felt is in the fact that\n\fL.] The Action of Druga on Consciousness. 63\nalthough, as often as not, the individual is undergoing the\nmost profound mental experiences, which he can generally\ndescribe at the time and often remember, yet beyond his\ndescription we have no means of judging of the real nature\nof the mental change. As against this disadvantage, it must\nbe noted that many drugs induce the same conditions in\ndifferent individuals and the descriptions they severally give\noften tally exactly.\nIt is now over a hundred years since Humphrey Davy\nplaced on record his experiences during the inhalation of dilute\nnitrous oxide gas. Since that time practically no advance\nhas been made along this line, and substances of this nature\nhave simply been regarded from the point of view of their\npractical uses.\nAll medical writers have mentioned the temporary exhilara\ntion which at first follows the administration of anaesthetics\nand many narcotics, but there has been to my knowledge no\nsystematic analysis of these primary effects\u2014no attempt\nto bring these mental symptoms into the domain of exact\nscience.\nIt is only fair at the outset to give some reasons for\nsupposing that experiments of this kind can ever yield\nscientific results : in a word to justify the discussion of the\nsubject at all.\nLet us suppose that under the influence of some substance\nthe sense of \" time \" is altered while the consciousness and\nreason are still retained. This is actually the case after the\nadministration of Indian hemp and it shows that the sense\nof time is not an invariable constant or an unalterable ac\ncompaniment of consciousness under all conditions, which is a\nfact to be taken seriously into consideration in the analysis\nof our idea of Time.\nOr, again, suppose after an individual has been inhaling\nether for some time and has become conscious of the different\nrelationship he bears to his environment that he then writes\ndown statements involving a logical deduction, and that\nthese statements appear equally logical long after the influence\nof the drug has passed off, this would constitute a fairly\nvaluable fact, which might be made use of in dealing with\nthe relationship of intelligence to environment. One cannot\n\f64 Ernest Dunbar. [PART\ndeny that it is possible to go too far in an attempt to generalise\nfrom conditions of this kind, but it seems to me that the\nknowledge one gains from these abnormal states is sufficiently\npositive to justify an attempt at scientific research.\nIn attempting an analysis of the primary effects of such a\nsubstance as alcohol we must first note that under ordinary\ncircumstances consciousness is conditioned by the environment.\nThis is very well borne out by the fact that, if the field of\nsensation be diminished, the greater the diminution, the greater\nthe tendency for sleep to supervene. Thus in order to secure\nsleep there should be the minimum of light and sound ; the\ntemperature of the bed-clothes should be the same as the body-\ntemperature, and then, as these sensations disappear, the in\ndividual sleeps. To quote Flammarion's flowery language\u2014\n\" Our attitudes in sleep tend to a passive equilibrium. All\nthe activities of the senses fade by degrees. The eyelids close\nAnd the eye is soonest asleep. The sense of touch loses its\nfaculty of perception and then it also sleeps. The sense of\nsmell disappears in turn. Hearing is the last to disappear,\nremaining like a vigilant sentinel to warn us in case of danger,\nbut at length it also fades away. Then sleep is complete.\" In\nother words, we are no longer conscious of an active environ\nment.\nThis environment may, for simplicity's sake, be taken to\ninclude not only the immediate surroundings, but also the\nmemory impressions of previous environments\u2014together with\nconclusions drawn by reason from these impressions. In walking\nacross a room, for instance, the attention is drawn to the spot\nto which one wishes to walk, or to obstacles in the way ; at\nthe same time, the memory impressions of what walking is\nlike and whether it is safe to walk on a wood-floor, etc., all\ncome into play in determining the simple action.\nNow consider the state of things under the early influence\nof alcohol or ether. The environment does not seem to change\nin detail. When it does change, it changes en masse. Things\nseen and heard are still appreciated in the same proportion\nto each other. A gun going off still sounds louder than, a\npop-gun. An electric light still looks brighter than a candle.\nPerspective still exists. Moreover the intelligence is by\nno means profoundly affected, the individual is still perfectly\n\fL.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 65\nlogical. He is so far alive to the unpleasant possibilities of\nhia position that he will very likely make a more or less\nsuccessful effort to compensate. Something has taken place\nin between his consciousness and his environment. The in\ntelligence is not by any means the complete victim of the\nsituation. Up to a certain stage, at least, it is master.\nThe simplest of all the effects produced by substances of\nthis kind is the feeling that there is some difference between\nthe relationship of the individual to his environment and the\nnormal relationship. This experience is very well exemplified\nby alcohol. After a few glasses of wine the individual is\nfrequently conscious of his mouth, teeth, and body generally\nas though it were not entirely a part of himself. Many de\nscribe a feeling of numbness, commencing from the forehead\nand working downwards. They are conscious of a certain\nunreality attending common sensations. The appreciation of\ntouch is diminished ; the same with hearing. The voices of\nfriends are heard, but their significance is not so readily\ngrasped. Smell and taste also suffer in much the same way,\nand lastly, sight becomes impaired..\nThe precise order, so far as I have been able to find out,\nis as follows. Firstly, touch and muscular sense, are affected ;\nthen hearing ; then taste and smell ; anil finally, sight. None\nof these senses are affected, at this stage, to an extreme degree ;\na more or less correct sense-perspective still exists. It is\nrather a growing inability to realise the significance of the\nvarious sensations as they are affected in order, which accom\npanies the first degree of alcoholic intoxication. In the later\nstages, these senses are affected more profoundly and in the\nsame order. The last to be affected is the last to disappear.\nA man in such a condition may be almost completely anaes\nthetic to painful impressions, cuts, bruises, etc., but still retain\nsufficient sense of hearing to make an attempt to respond when\nspoken to. Or again, when he no longer responds to sound,\nhe may look dreamily around for a moment if his eyelids be\nheld up and a bright light flashed in his eyes.\nIn the earlier stages, the person is perfectly conscious,\ncolloquially speaking, of not feeling quite \" at home.\" He re\nquires to think before pronouncing his words. If he moves\nhis legs or arms, he is not quite sure whether he will\nE\n\f66 Ernest Dunbar. [PART\noverdo or underdo the action. In other words, he is not in\nthe same rapport with his surroundings as he is normally.\nYet the significant fact is that up to this stage his intelligence\nis alert and grasps the meaning of the situation so well that\nevery effort is made to gain control again.\nIt is this domination of the reason over the situation which\nseems to me the most significant fact of all, and it is precisely\nthis fact which keeps emphasising itself in all experiences\nof a similar nature. Touching this point, Snow, in his treatise\non anaesthetics, writing from a time when such substances\nfirst became known, remarks that the more intelligent the\npatient, the more anaesthetic he required to put him under.\nI remember my attention being first drawn to this apparent\nsupremacy of the intelligence during an experiment with ether.\nAfter inhaling about two ounces of the stuff, out of curiosity,\nI became much annoyed at the loud ticking of a watch on\nthe mantelpiece close by. There were no other sounds in\nthe neighbourhood, and, as it was nearly dark in the room,\nthe only earthly sensation I was thoroughly conscious of was\nthis ticking, which had assumed, to my ears, the sound of\na steam hammer. I made an attempt to stop the watch and\nthis attempt was certainly a most clumsy one. I had frequently\nstopped the watch before, and one would have imagined that\nthe recollection of the side on which I had to stop it would\nhave become instinctive through habit. Not so ; I scratched\nabout on the wrong side. Reason, however, was perfectly\nalert, and woke up to the possible meaning of this ; also calcu\nlated that without some reminder I might forget the incident,\nand I felt constrained to write down the following note :\n\" Under the abnormal, memory is gradually lost, reason never ! \"\nReason here took advantage of an incident and at the same\ntime seemed to appreciate the part played by itself in the\naffair ; and all this at a time when the external world was\nseeming more like a dream than a reality.\nOf course one uses the word \" reason \" as a separate term\nrather for convenience than anything else. We distinguish a\nconscious process which grasps the environment as a mass\nof sensations, from the process which analyses them and\nestablishes for itself the relative character or significance of\nthese sensations. It is possible that the one process to a\n\fL.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 67\ncertain extent includes the other ; yet, for a dialectic purpose,\nwe distinguish them.\nNow, these processes have a physical parallel. The more of\nthe substance is taken, the more marked is this deviation from\nthe normal, and, as a general rule, the effects pass off in the\nreverse order to that in which they come on. In some in\nstances, when the quantity of the drug has been large, changes\nare produced in the cerebral cells, which can be recognised\nmicroscopically : e.g. the disintegration of Niss1's granules and the\ndiminution in size of the nucleus. Yet even with what must\nbe regarded as a profound physical disturbance, there is no\nmarked interference with the integrity of the intelligence, and\nafter the influence has passed off the individual is in the\nsame mental state as he was at the commencement. It is\nprobable, indeed, that a change of a permanent nature has\nbeen produced, otherwise it is difficult to understand how\nchronic drug-taking should modify the character and intellect of\na person ; but this change must be insignificant after only one or\ntwo administrations, otherwise it would be more in evidence.\nOne of the most interesting drugs I have had the oppor\ntunity of studying has been Indian Hemp. It has been well\nknown for hundreds of years by many Eastern nations under\nvarious names. In India, it is called Gunja or Ganji, some\ntimes Bhang; in Persia and Egypt, Hashish or Hatchis. In\nEngland it is at present used as an empirical remedy in a\nfew cases of obscure neuralgia and obstinate cases of migraine\nand sleeplessness. Its action is rather uncertain. Out of six\nof my friends who took some of the same preparation, in two\nno effects at all were produced. This uncertainty has been\nreferred to the physical properties of the resin containing the\nactive principle, and in order to secure absorption, it is con\nsidered wisest to suspend it in a finely divided condition in\nsome form of mucilage.\nThe effect of the drug on intelligent Europeans is fairly\nconstant. It produces a singular loss of the sense of time\nand personality and a disordered appreciation of the surround\nings. In Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine, Dr. Marshall of\nCambridge gives a very characteristic account of the action\nof Cannabis Indica. It corresponds in almost every detail\nwith accounts given by others of the strange experience.\n\f68 Ernest Dunbar. [part\nHe writes: \"About 2.30 in the afternoon of the nineteenth\nof February last, whilst engaged in putting up an apparatus\nfor the distillation of zinc ethyl, I took between .1 and '15\ngrs. of the pure substance (cannabinon) from the end of a\nglass rod. The substance very gradually dissolved in my mouth :\nit possessed a peculiar, pungent, aromatic, and slightly bitter\ntaste, and seemed after some time to produce slight anaesthesia\nof the mucous membrane covering the tongue and fauces. 1\nforgot all about it and went on with my work ; but soon\nafter the zinc ethyl had commenced to distil\u2014about 3.15\u2014I\nsuddenly felt a peculiar dryness in the mouth, apparently due\nto increased viscidity of the saliva. This was quickly followed\nby paraesthesia and weakness in the legs. Gradually my mental\npower diminished. I was no longer able to control the steps\nof the operation and commenced to wander aimlessly round\nthe room. I had a most irresistible tendency to laugh ; every\nthing seemed so ridiculously funny. At times I felt more\nrational, but these lucid intervals grew gradually shorter and\nI fell under the influence of the drug. I was now in a con\ndition of acute intoxication : my speech was slurring, my gait\nataxic. I was free from all sense of care and worry, and\nconsequently felt extremely happy. Fits of laughter occurred,\nespecially at first, and sometimes the muscles of my face were\ndrawn to an almost painful degree. The most peculiar effect\nwas a complete loss of time-relation ; time seemed to have\nno existence. I was continually taking out my watch, thinking\nthat hours must have passed, whereas only a few minutes\nhad elapsed. This, I believe, was due to a complete loss of\nmemory for recent events. The occurrence of lucid intervals\nwas also peculiar in many ways. They seemed to come on\nsuddenly sometimes, but not always, as if a result of an effort\nof will ; they lasted a variable time, being shortest when the\nsymptoms of intoxication were most marked, and while in\nthem I could converse in a rational manner, and even direct\nthe work of the laboratory to a certain extent. About six\no'clock I had two cups of coffee, and afterwards, feeling quite\nbetter, walked home. The fresh air and exertion revived me.\nNo unpleasant after-effects were experienced.\"\nThat is Dr. Marshall's account of the strange effect produced\nby the drug. I had committed to paper my own experience\n\fL.] The Action of Drugs on Consci&u&ness. 69\nof the substance long before I read his account ; in fact the\nactual scientific value of my own experience lay in the fact\nthat, up to the time of taking the Indian Hemp, I knew\nnone of its peculiar properties beyond the fact that it was a\nspecies of narcotic. I had tasted some of the green extract\nout of curiosity to know not the effects but the taste. The\nelement of imaginative expectation was therefore reduced to\na minimum. The effects, as in Dr. Marshal1's case, came on\nquite suddenly.\nIt was on March 29th, .1900, about a quarter to four in\nthe afternoon, while looking through some materia medico, speci\nmens, that I tasted some of the green extract. I remember\nremarking its soapy taste and the difficulty of getting the\nstuff from between my teeth.\nI forgot all about it and nothing happened till ten minutes\npast five. I had taken the five minutes to five train from\nBroad Street, due at Hampstead at about 5.15. It was only\non leaving Kentish Town Station that I became conscious of\nanything at all strange. Then it seemed as if I must have\nbeen hours in the train. Between Kentish Town and Gospel\nOak time seemed so extended that I had continually to keep\nwatching the familiar features of the landscape\u2014houses, etc.,\nto make sure I had not gone beyond my destination.\nIt was between Gospel Oak and the next station that I\ndiscovered the lucid intervals. It always seemed as the result\nof an effort of will to me that I was able to procure these\nlucid intervals, during which the only sensations of abnor\nmality were a sense of tightness and compactness and an\nexceedingly dry throat. To maintain the lucid interval soon\nbecame an effort, and the next incident which attracted my\nattention was, that on leaving the train and walking down\nthe platform there seemed quite an interval of time between\nthe placing of my foot on the ground and the realisation of\nhaving done so. Yet the moment my attention was drawn\nto this peculiarity, the phenomenon vanished and I had a\nlucid interval.\nOn arriving home I went straight to my room, fully per\nsuaded what was the cause of the mischief. I remember being\nmuch disturbed by the image of myself in the mirror. Beyond\na slight paleness there was nothing actually strange in my\n\f70 Ernest Dunbar. [part\nappearance; but I had a difficulty in realising that the form\nI saw there could actually have anything to do with me.\nYet in the background of my mind there was a feeble but\nsufficient grasp of the significance of the situation ; and along\nwith this the fear of impending death. Mitchell Bruce\nmentions this fear, and had I read of this before taking the\ndrug I should have discounted my sensations and been less\ndisturbed. It seemed to me as if my consciousness were\nbecoming disintegrated, and the hideous extension of time\nseemed only to prolong the agony.\nRinger makes a note of the fact that the individual in\nthis condition frequently acts rationally and is able to react\nin quite a normal manner to his surroundings. A student\nfriend of mine told me of an acquaintance of his who, under\nits influence, made an attempt to throw himself out of the\nwindow, and after my own experience of the drug I was not\nsurprised at this. It seems that the person under cannabis\nindica behaves either like a rational being or like a raving\nmaniac. Either he braves the mental uproar by sheer force\nof will, or else lets himself go. We are told that in India\nduring the hill-fights some of the natives chew it and rush in\na frenzied condition to the conflict.\nHere, again, there is an example of intelligence over-riding\nthe situation ; and the question is as to how far this mental\nsupremacy can go. It would be gratifying to know that, so\nlong as the individual maintains any relationship with his\nenvironment, however trifling, his intelligence maintains its\nintegrity and can, by an effort of will, grasp the situation\nand see things in their right light.1 At Bethnal House\nAsylum I once saw a man, a melancholiac, who outgrew his\ndelusions almost every other day, and when questioned as to\nsome fleeting delusion he had harboured a few days ago,\nseemed quite ashamed. He even admitted the possibility of\nhis being in error on the subject of the delusion he had that\nday. Of course he may have been representing his feelings as\ndifferent from what they really were. He may have thought\nthat we were all wrong and may have been simply attempt\ning to humour us. However this may be, many cases of\n1 Havelock Ellis in the Contemporary Review, 1898, emphasises this point\nin connection with mezcal.\n\fL.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 71\nmental abnormality, whether natural or artificially produced\nby drugs, suggest that it is not so much the intelligence that\nis affected, as the relationship between this intelligence and\nthe environment (including the memory-environment). The\nquestion merits consideration, but it is difficult to discuss it\nwithout trespassing on the domains of metaphysics. The\nnearest approach to the meaning of the word \" intelligence \"\nin this sense would be the capacity for exercising logic. A\nman might have this capacity in all its integrity, yet, if by\nsome unhappy physical accident he was deprived of some\npart of the memory of previous environments, he would pro\nbably act under some conditions like an insane person.\nThus a man with a delusion X may have that delusion\nsimply because there has been either a total or partial paralysis\nof memory-ideas on the subject of X, but in any case he will\nact up to the delusion. The victim of delirium tremens acts\nas though the rats and beetles were real, and in that respect\nat least he is logical. Similarly, if the lucid intervals during\nthe influence of cannabis indica mean anything psychologi\ncally, they indicate that the intelligence is quite alive all the\ntime.\nI believe, as Dr. Marshall suggests, that the sense of time\nduration is prolonged because the memory of recent events\nis impaired, and to illustrate this, I will quote an account\nwritten before I read Dr. Marshal1's experience.\n\" The attempt to analyse the why and wherefore of this\nresulted in the discovery that it required a great effort to\nremember in detail the environment of the preceding moment,\nat the present moment. It seemed as if the moment that\nhad gone with its myriad impressions was forgotten at once\nand the moment which succeeded was hurried through and\nforgotten again.\"\nThe fact that time seems to go quickly when we are\ninterested and slowly when we are not, as also the fact that\nwhen the mind is very incompletely en rapport with the\noutside world, as in dreams, time is extended, seem to indicate\nthat the relative sense of time is a product of the association\nof consciousness with environment. The less this association,\nthe greater extension time seems to possess.\nI believe that the loss of the personal sense is to be\n\f72 Ernest Dunbar. [part\nexplained in the same way. Self-identity is established as a\nsensation by a perpetual contrast with other objects of sensa\ntion. This is recognised by all psychologists as a cardinal\nfactor in producing the personal sense.\nThe full conception of personal identity requires an entire\nappreciation of the environment and a clear memory-impression\nof the preceding environment up to that stage. Under Can\nnabis Indica this last is missing, or at any rate very incom\nplete. The memory-impression is gained by an effort of will,\nand hence, during a lucid interval, the individual feels quite\nnormal.\nThere is one experiment with Indian Hemp which I have\nnot had the opportunity of making, viz., taking the reaction-\ntime. I doubt if it would yield any other than a normal\nresult, because, unless the subject were narcotised to a dan\ngerous extent, the mere fact that his attention would be\nnecessary would bring about a lucid interval. Very little else\nis known about the drug. In Eastern nations it is reported\nto produce dreams of an emotional and erotic nature.\nRinger states that curious delusions may follow its admini\nstration. The person may feel as though his brain were\nboiling, or the roof of his head lifted off.\nIn my own experience, when some eight hours afterwards\nits effects were beginning to wear off, I felt as though my\nthroat was an iron funnel up which came hot air from a\nfurnace beneath. A little thought made me recognise this as\na delusion, though the impression was realistic enough at the\ntime.\nIt seems as though the entire action of the drug can be\nexplained by assuming that there is a temporary paresis of\nthe memory, and in the delusional cases the delusion may be\nsimply evidence of a localised paralysis of the same faculty.\nIt is even possible that the tendency towards unmeaning\nlaughter may fall under the same explanation, for, as Sully\npointed out, the idea of the ridiculous and humorous is\nfounded, as a rule, on the wilful neglect of some part of a\nmental picture,\u2014the denial on purpose of some part of the\nmental perspective.\nHere, instead of there being a wilful negligence to see the\nentire picture, there is, through impaired memory, an inability\n\fL.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 73\nto do so ; and hence things appear ridiculous, because there is\npresent a disconnected picture, which seems a jumble of\nqueer contradictions.\nThe next narcotic I have to treat as illustrating some psy\nchological points is ether.\nA couple of months back, my attention was drawn by one\nof the members of the Society to a paper contributed to the\nProceedings some ten years ago by Sir William (then Professor)\nRamsay, and I found that his experience under ether was very\nsimilar to what I had myself undergone. Since that time I\nhave come across a teacher of chemistry who seems to have\nhad a similar experience with the same suInstance.\nThe action of ether, if inhaled diluted with about sixty\nper cent, of air, is fairly gradual.\nThe first symptoms are a sense of oppression in the head\nand profuse salivation. The face feels hot, and the peripheral\narteries are dilated. This happens quite an appreciable time\nbefore any mental symptoms appear. Next, the drama of early\nalcoholic intoxication is enacted again, with this difference,\nthat there is seldom any staggering or difficulty in walking\nabout correctly ; and, since under ether the muscular sense is\ndiminished just as under alcohol, the conclusion is that the\nstaggering after alcohol is due to early affection of the cere\nbellum. Next comes the sensation that the body is just as\nmuch a part of the environment as anything else, and it is\nperhaps this sensation which, together with the wide-awake\nintelligence, compels the individual to adopt the standpoint of\nsubjective idealism ; which, in its turn, drives him to think\nthat a.t last the solution of the mystery is dawning upon him.\nMy own experiences under ether I shall never forget, and,\nstrange to say, I experienced nothing similar under chloroform\nor ethyl bromide, though the same feeling came on and lasted\nfor a few minutes after inhaling ethyl iodide.\nIn my mind thought seemed to race like a mill-wheel.\nNothing was lost\u2014every trifling phenomenon seemed to fall\ninto its place as a logical event in the universe. As in Sir\nWilliam Ramsay's experience, everything seemed so absolute.\nIt was either yes or no. Either this was not reality or\nit was. If it was not, then it seemed to me in the\nnature of things that I could never know reality. Then it\n\f74 Ernest Dunbar. [PART\ndawned upon me that the only logical position was subjective\nidealism, and, therefore, my experience must be reality. Then\nby degrees I began to realise that I was the One, and the\nuniverse of which I was the principle was balancing itself\ninto completeness. All thought seemed struggling to a logical\nconclusion ; every trifling movement in the world outside my\nconsciousness represented a perfectly logical step in the final\nreadjustment\nI could hear my heart-throbs getting longer and longer.\nAt length I felt they would cease, and the drama of exist\nence would be over. I remember at the time feeling so strong\na repugnance to this termination that I ceased administering\nany more of the stuff and got up. Things seemed objective\nand tangible while I was walking about, but, on lying down\nagain, the same experience commenced again, with this differ\nence, that now account had to be taken of the first experience\nin order to bring about the same conclusion. Just as the\npsychological moment came, I moved my arm, and the same\nprocess commenced again. I let it go on to the bitter end\nthis time, and as the moment of extinction arrived I felt\nstrangely normal, and not a bit sleepy.\nThese were the effects of a very small dose of ether on\nme. I don't suppose I got to the end of even the first stage\nof anaesthesia ; and what to me was a righteous horror at\nthe approaching end of the universe would correspond, in many\npatients who take ether for surgical purposes, to the period\nof struggling and screaming.\nUnder the influence of ether, there is no doubt the mind\nis highly stimulated, and it is extremely difficult to see where\nthe cerebral depression comes in\u2014at least in relation to the\nhigher faculties of thought. There is nothing essentially\nillogical in the Fichtean standpoint; it is only strange that\nso trifling an action as taking ether should condition the\nultimate realisation of that standpoint. Under ether this\nwould present no difficulty to one's mind. One would simply feel\nthat in a scheme where logic was the beginning and end of all\nchange, no such thing as a trifle could exist,\u2014that life had led up\nto the inhalation of ether, and this was to be the end of it all.\nSuch was the effect ether had on me, and each time the\nexperience has been much the same.\n\fL.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 75\nI have made a point of asking patients in the surgical\nwards how they felt when they were being anaesthetised.\nThe common experience (eighty per cent, of cases) is that of\nrushing into a dark tunnel. There is a singing in the ears\nand a flashing of lights in the eyes. On coming round they\nmay pass through a struggling stage, but more usually they\nfeel restless and talkative.\nA relative of mine had an operation five weeks ago, and\nshe told me afterwards that, when coming out of the anaes\nthetic, she was conscious of talking at a great rate, yet felt\nquite unable to stop. She only dimly remembers what she\nwas talking about.\nThe sense of time is disturbed under ether, chloroform,\nand nitrous oxide. It is not changed in a recognisable way\nas under Gannabis Indica, but at a certain stage of the anaesthesia\nthe time-sense vanishes.\nThis is most marked under gas, where a patient will wake\nup after the tooth is drawn with a positive conviction that\nthe operation has not yet commenced. After chloroform or\nether the patient seldom has any conception of how long he\nor she has been under.\nThere are no lucid intervals during the early stages induced\nby these general anaesthetics, for although the activity of the\ncerebrum is stimulated and depressed in turn, starting from\nthe highest faculties and working downwards, yet the process\nis fairly extensive ; it does not apply only to special parts,\nbut produces a gradual depression of the entire brain.\nLuchsinger has pointed out that chloroform, ether, and\ncarbon dioxide gas produce a marked effect on the conductivity\nof nerves, and it seems probable that in addition to the action\nthese substances have been shown to exercise on the cerebral\ncells, there is also temporary paralysis of the conductivity of\nthe association tracts.\nWith regard to the physical action of these drugs, there is\na singular fact, that I have never seen noticed, namely, that\nmost of the general anaesthetics possess the property of dissolving\nfat and oils. Chloroform, Ether, Benzene, Ethyl Bromide, Carbon\nbisulphide, Ethyl iodide, Amylene, Carbon tetrachloride, all possess\nthis quality. It was this physical resemblance which made\nme try Benzene and Carbon tetrachloride.\n\f76 Ernest Dunbar. [PART\nThe action of benzene is slower than that of chloroform,\nbut with the exception of the unpleasant smell and a loud\nroaring in the ears, the same effects are produced in the\nfirst stage of anaesthesia as with the latter.\nWith chloroform, the first inhalation produces its effect ;\neven a powerful sniff from a bottle of chloroform may be\nfollowed by a queer feeling.\nAs with other substances, the first effect is the feeling\nof the unreality of common sensations. This is a general\nexperience, and anybody who smells a few drops from a\nhandkerchief will admit it. After this preliminary sensation\nis past, I personally go through nothing resembling in the\nslightest degree the effects of ether. The only wish I have\nat that stage is for more chloroform, \u2014a wish I am not conscious\nof having felt with ether. I lose interest in everything. I\ndon't care who sees me and in what condition they see me,\nI have only one desire\u2014for more chloroform\u2014and then even\nthat wish soon goes.\nThree students besides myself have noticed the flashing\nof stars in the visual field, synchronous with the heart-beat,\nunder the action of chloroform. Two of us noticed that each\nbright point underwent a peculiar circular motion. The move\nment was in the path of a boomerang rather than in a true\ncircle. I do not know any reason for this, but it was curious\nthat two persons should have observed it. These stars increase\nin number as the anaesthesia deepens, and on opening the eyes\nthey still continue to show themselves over the entire visual\nfield, which gradually grows darker.\nCarbon tetrachloride resembles chloroform in everything\nexcept its smell. Also it is not sweet, and it often contains a\nsmall quantity of the disagreeable carbon bisulphide, rendering\nit very unpleasant to inhale.\nThe effect of chloroform is in some respects very different\nfrom that of ether. If the two are given in equal strengths,\nchloroform is much the more rapid in its action, and there is\nnot the same tendency to excitement as with the other drug ;\nfurther, a very much smaller quantity of chloroform is sufficient\nto produce the most profound anaesthesia. The earlier stages\nare therefore short, and there is scarcely time for evidence of\nmental changes to show.\n\fL.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 77\nI remember only one other sensation in connection with\nchloroform, and as I have not met any one who had had a\nsimilar experience, mine has no value. It seemed to me that\ndeep down somewhere in my consciousness voices were wrang\nling and quarrelling ; sometimes over a trifle such as the closing\nof a door. The voices were perfectly distinct and generally\ndisagreeable. At other times they would be talking at me.\nThis sort of conversation would commence : \" So you see we've\ngot you again.\" Then I would think, \" Oh ! won't you leave\nme alone ? I want to rest,\" and the answer would come : \" We'll\nhave the last word \" ; and with that would ensue a mutter\ning and a grumbling, which occasionally rose to a whining\ncomplaint from these voices. I have never inhaled chloroform\nwithout hearing these voices ; they last quite a short time\nand do not usually begin until some time has elapsed.\nWith regard to the craving for more anaesthetic, Dr. Keith,\nin a book entitled, \" Fads of an Old Physician,\" mentions it\nas having attended some of his experiments with Dr. Simpson\nat the time of the introduction of chloroform.\nIt is exceedingly difficult to draw conclusions from many\nof these facts, and it is not easy to make many experiments\nof the kind, as the majority of people have a healthy re\npugnance to dosing themselves, even for scientific purposes\nwith substances of this nature. I think, however, that a care\nful and systematic study of the effects of drugs on the con\nsciousness must of necessity yield some positive results. Sir\nWilliam Ramsay in his paper ten years ago urged that those\nwho had from choice or necessity gone through experiences of\nthis kind should record them, and the few observations I have\nbeen able to make on the subject suggest that these strange\nmental symptoms which appear so much a part of the per\nsonality of the individual may be evidence of some definite\npsychological law.\n\f\f\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nPART LI.\nDECEMBER, 1905.\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETING.\nTHE 125th General Meeting of the Society was held in the Hall\nat 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Thursday, May 11th,\n1905, at 4.15 p.m.; SIR OLIVER LODGE in the chair.\nThe PRESIDENT, PROFESSOR CHARLES RICHET, read the sub\nstance of the paper which is printed below under the title of\n\" Xenoglossie, 1'Ecriture automatique en langues e\"trangeres:\"\n\f80 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\nI.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE WELSH REVIVAL:\n1904-5.\nBy the Rev. A. T. Fhyer.\nIt is now twenty-three years since Edmund Gurney asked me\nto join in the work of the S.P.R. My answer to his request\nwas that I would do so on one condition, viz., that the Society\nwould not attempt to prove the supernatural, by which I\nmeant that I was willing to assist in the examination and\nclassification of physical and psychical phenomena connected\nwith ghosts, dreams, etc., solely as terrestrial events, and with\nout reference to the ends such things may subserve in the\nspiritual sphere or the life beyond the grave. I maintained\nthen, as I do now with even greater conviction, that whatever\nuse individual members might make of the results of our\ninquiries, whatever inferences persons might draw from the\nverified stories collected by the Society, our work as a Society\nwould be accomplished by that verification and tabulation.\nGurney entirely assented to this view of our work, and the\nhistory of the S.P.R. is sufficient evidence of the loyalty which\nhas been observed towards its first principles.\nIn dealing with the Welsh Revival in this paper, I desire\nto maintain exactly the same line, to relate events so far as\none has been enabled to get at their truth, and to present\nthe evidence in a more or less classified form.\nIn this work two difficulties arise : (i.) the inability of most\npersons to observe accurately the things passing under their very\neyes ; (ii.) the unwillingness of persons who have had abnormal\nexperiences either to relate them or to submit to a mild cross-\nexamination if they do relate them. Both difficulties are\ncommonly found in S.P.R. work. The first is beyond our\npower to remove entirely, but as the Society's methods become\n\fLI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 81\nbetter known we may hope slowly to increase the now limited\nnumber of those who can observe accurately. The power of\nmental concentration so habitually exercised as to be ready at\nall moments to receive and retain impressions with precision\nis not common ; we can do our best to encourage its growth.\nThe second difficulty is the greater one, particularly in the\nsubject under discussion. Most of the persons whose experi\nences we desire to examine and record regard them as too\nsacred for any such process, and some have more than hinted\nthat my inquiry is at least questionable, if not altogether pro\nfane. Argument avails but little with these good people,\nbut my endeavour has been to suggest that as the Supreme\nMind, to Whom they attribute the operations of which they\nhave been the subjects, manifests in all His works law and\norder, there can be no more inherent profanity in trying to\narrive at the particular laws or methods of the mental, psychi\ncal, or spiritual spheres than in investigating the physical side\nof His works.\nMr. Myers in his Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 298,\nadopted a similar attitude. Prof. James, in Some Varieties of\nIteligious Experience, follows the same line, and I may quote\nDr. Starbnck's introduction to his Psychology of Religion where\nhe says that \" The student in the psychological laboratory\nmeets with as much orderliness and sequence among the facts\nof emotion or memory or reasoning as the physicist in his\nlaboratory. ... It is scarcely questioned at the present\ntime that all our mental processes follow an orderly sequence.\nWe go one step further, and affirm that there is no event\nin the spiritual life which does not occur in accordance with\nimmutable laws.\"\nI sincerely wish that my inquiry into revival phenomena\ncould have been as full and detailed as Dr. Starbuck's was\nin his researches into Conversion, but similar thoroughness re\nquired what was beyond my power to give,\u2014many months of\npatient personal examination of witnesses, a mastery of the\nWelsh language, and sufficient acquaintance with the mental\nhabits of the people to enable one to carry on the inquisi\ntion without arousing too much suspicion and distrust. I\nconsented to write this paper only because no one else, so\nfar as I know, has attempted to examine the Revival at all\n\f82 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\nin detail, from our point of view, and because even a partial\nattempt of this sort may go a little way towards preventing\nthe growth of a revival legend. I have attended revival ser\nvices, heard Evan Koberts at three of his services, read most\nof the daily reports of meetings, corresponded with men and\nwomen of all sorts and conditions in various counties, and\ninterviewed a fairly large number of people.\nFor the purpose of this paper I sent out nearly 250 copies\nof a circular asking for particulars of incideuts that would\ninterest our members. (See (1) in the Appendix. All\nnumerical references hereafter are to the cases in this Appen\ndix and the original documents of all the cases referred to\nor quoted, containing the full names of the witnesses, are,\nas usual, stored in the S.P.K. office.) Not more than half of\nthe stamped addressed envelopes enclosed with the circulars\nhave found their way back to me, and of the half that covered\nreplies I might have spared some for all the information they\nconveyed. But I owe, and here tender thanks to several\nwilling correspondents for the trouble taken to answer ques\ntions and suggest possible sources of information.\nIf the material to hand is limited in bulk, it has the\nmerit of being mostly original. Readers will note the strong\nfamily likeness that exists between the recitals drawn from\npersons in South and North Wales, from men and women of\ndifferent degrees of education and social habit, who were\nignorant of each other's existence, and wrote therefore without\nany possibility of collusion. That we should find these simi\nlarities is a distinct encouragement to researchers to persevere\nwith such inquiries, confident that the underlying laws are not\nbeyond our reach.\nI first heard of the Revival at the beginning of October\n1904, when a vivid account was given to me viva voce (since\nthen written tor me, see (2) Appendix) of the outbreak of fervour\namongst some young women at New Quay, in Cardiganshire,\nwho had been stirred to deeper thought some months previously.\nThe part played by the sex whose most valuable mental en\ndowment is intuition forms \" a marked feature of the whole\nmovement, whether seen in leadership or in subordination.\nThese young women were in the opinion of some persons,\nthe initiators of the Revival in South Wales, but the move\n\fLI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 83\nment soon became more prominently associated with a\nyoung man named Evan Roberts, and it was his efforts\nat his native place, Loughor, that first attracted the interest\nof the newspapers. Reporters and editors saw their oppor\ntunity and used it to the full. Without doubt they\nfostered the Revival, and their papers suffered no diminution\nof circulation in consequence. To the columns of vigorous\nand fairly accurate matter provided day by day by the\ntwo leading journals of South Wales, describing the ser\nvices from November 10th onward for five months, much of\nthe rapid development of excitement over the Revival was\ncertainly due. (Reprints of these are in the S.P.R. Library.)\nBut if the spread of the mysterious atmosphere from village\nto village and town to town was encouraged by the news\npapers, it was not caused by them. Press influence is great,\nbut it has its limitations. No amount of sensational writing\ncould have enkindled the tremendous enthusiasm, with its\nresulting mass of converts, which characterised the Revival in\nsome districts ; those who claim that it did must show why\nthe same influence utterly failed in other places. For one of\nthe curiosities of the movement has been its very unequal\noperation. This is to be accounted for, as I shall presently\nprove, but it has nothing to do with the newspapers.\nFrom Loughor the Revival spread to Trecynon, near Aber-\ndare, thence to the Garw and Llynfi Valleys, on to Mountain\nAsh, and then to the Rhondda Valley, and elsewhere. Mean\nwhile a series of outbreaks was taking place in Merionethshire.\nThis had no ostensible connection with the southern Revival,\nneither had it material support from the press until the\nappearance of the curious lights, to which I shall refer later,\ncaused remark and attracted an army of reporters and in\nvestigators, much to the alarm and, in some cases, disgust of\nthe peaceful inhabitants.\nAlthough Evan Roberts' name is the most prominent in\nthe Revival, he neither created nor sustained it for the most\npart. He is the embodiment of the Spirit of the Revival, the\nmost striking manifestation of the force that caused it, and\nto a very great extent its leader and director, but he did not\nproduce the Revival, nor did the Revival produce him.\nEvan Roberts was born at Loughor in 1878; he is the fifth\n\f84 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nin a family of eight, four sons and four daughters. His father\nis a collier, the mother a simple, honest housewife : neither the\nparents nor their forebears have been people of unusual ability\nor mark. Evan attended the Church School of the upper village\nuntil he was 12 years of age and, although diligent and regular\nin school-life, showed no capacity that distinguished him from\nother lads ; in ordinary work he was just the average, healthy,\nplay-loving boy, cheerful and willing. Between 1 1 and 1 2\nyears of age he had a slight accident to his face, after which\nas a consequence he showed symptoms of a nervous shock. I\nrefer to this later on. The incident has not been related else\nwhere and may be denied by some of his friends, but I have\ngood reason for thinking there is truth in the story. From\nhis earliest days Evan had a strong bias towards religion, but\nI learn on good authority that not much reliance can be\nplaced on the statement which has found its way into print\nto the effect that the mother destined her newly-born child\nfor the ministry. Most Welsh mothers desire to see at least\none son in the ministry, but there is no evidence that I\ncan discover of Mrs. Roberts having had an unusual desire of\nthis kind. Roberts spent most of his time in Bible reading,\nboth as a boy and as a collier, and he may almost be\ndescribed as a man of one book. At the same time, the\ncatalogue of his modest library, which has been read to me\nby one who obtained it from Evan, shows that he paid more\nthan usual attention to general culture, especially in Welsh\nbooks of reference. He wrote poetry, some of which was\npublished in newspapers, and is a fair performer on three or\nfour musical instruments. I am assured by a scholar who\nhas tested his knowledge that Evan Roberts has a better\nliterary equipment than most Welsh colliers and that is say\ning a great deal, for many of them read widely. When he\nbecame a collier at the age of 12, and during his blacksmith\nperiod in his 25th year, the Bible was his constant com\npanion, prayer the ever-sought recreation. Every interval in\nhis working days and many of his night hours he spent in\nearnest prayer. At the Chapel he was an active partaker in\nall the various exercises and classes. The one testimony\nborne by every person who came into contact with Evan in\nwhatever capacity, is that his life, conduct, and profession\n\fu.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 85\nwere and are absolutely consistent. I have rarely found such\nunanimous witness to any good man. His talk in private\nfor many years was on revivals, he read all he could find on\nthe subject, and his prayers were for a revival. The idea\npossessed him night and day. A few weeks ago he told one\nof my informants, a pressman who has been in close touch\nwith the revivalist, that on one occasion, four years before\nthe Revival, he had suggested to a young preacher a sermon\non 2 Chron. vii. 14. The verse seemed to him to furnish\nthe programme of a revival. To it he has certainly been\nmost loyal. I give these details because without them it is\nimpossible to form a proper estimate of the man or of his\nposition. We can easily understand from them that if the\nworking, active consciousness of this lad was mainly occupied\nwith this one absorbing idea, how richly stored his sub-con\nsciousness became with the materials on which he is now\nmaking heavy drafts.\nAfter a year at the forge, Roberts determined to prepare for\nthe ministry in the Calvinistic Methodist Body, and he entered\nthe preparatory school at Newcastle Emlyn in the middle of\nSeptember, 1904. The head-master (see (3) Appendix) says of\nhim that during the few weeks he was at school he betrayed\na capacity and aptitude for work considerably above the\naverage. On the fifth Sunday of his residence a missioner\nnamed Seth Joshua came to the village on a mission, and on\nthe following Tuesday some of the young women from New\nQuay came over to help. Evan Roberts was present, much\nto the regret of the head-master, as the pupil had been in\nbed with a cold. On the Wednesday night the master saw\nEvan in the Chapel standing up to \" confess Christ,\" then\nkneeling in prayer and going through a most agonising soul-\nstruggle. This however was overshadowed by what happened\nnext day at Blaenanerch, where, as he said, he was \"bent\"\n(see Western. Mail reprint). After this Roberts was at New\ncastle Emlyn for about three weeks, but not in school. The\nmaster, being totally unable to appreciate the mighty force\nat work in one who spent all day and most of the night in\nprayer and meditation, tried to get Evan to study some simple\ntask, but the young man declared that as soon as he touched\na book he felt the spirit crushing him, and it was only by\n\f86 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\nputting the book on one side that he could obtain relief. As\nhe said this a tremor ran through him, and his face and\nneck were observed to quiver in a remarkable way. To most\nof the people around him he was then an enigma ; only two\nor three persons had any suspicion of what these paroxysms\nand visions meant. On a certain Sunday night he heard a\nvoice bidding him go home to Loughor and speak to the\nyoung people of his own Chapel : the following day he went.\nPermission having been obtained to hold services, the work\nbegan on October 31st; before many evenings Loughor was\n\"on fire\" and thence the flame spread.\nEvan Roberts is a mystic, and to understand his place in\nhumanity we must study the lives and writings of Eckhart,\nTauler, Hylton, St. John of the Cross, and especially Juliana\nof Norwich, persons whose names, I suspect, were unknown to\nRoberts until recently. His teaching is limited in scope, but\nso far has been more in accordance with the Spanish than\nwith the German mystics. Is this due to racial affinity ?\nRoberts is probably of Iberian stock.\nThe story of his visions will, I understand, be published.\nHere is one and it is typical of the rest. It occurred before\nhe left home for the Grammar School. \" One Friday night\nlast spring when praying by my bedside before retiring, I was\ntaken up into a great expanse without time or space\u2014it was\ncommunion with God. Before this it was a far-off God that\nI had \" (cp. Suso on his vision. \" It was without form or\nmode, but contained within itself the most entrancing delight.\"\nSuso died in 1365). \"I was frightened that night but never\nsince. So great was my shivering that I rocked the bed and\nmy brother awakened, took hold of me, thinking I was ill.\nAfter that I was awakened every night a little after one.\nThis was most strange, for through the years 1 slept like a\nrock and no disturbance in my room would arouse me. From\nthat hour I was taken up into Divine fellowship for about\nfour hours. What it was I cannot tell you, except that it\nwas Divine. About five I was allowed to sleep until nine.\"\nMr. Seth Joshua, before-mentioned, has said that for four\nyears before meeting with Roberts in Cardiganshire, he had\nprayed for the raising up of a revivalist, \" not from Oxford\nor Cambridge, but from the plough or the coalpit.\" (A\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 87\nparagraph also appeared in the South Wales Daily NCAVS,\nJuly 1st, 1905, to the effect that a deacon eight years\nago offered a similar prayer.) Mr. Joshua was not alone in\npraying for a revival : I have evidence that many in all\nparts of Wales had been doing the same, and I suggest that\nif our theory of telepathic influence is true, it must some day\nbe recognised as one at least of the elemental forces in what\nis called prayer. I am not, I think, going beyond the limits\nof our inquiry if I urge the examination of prayer as a\npsychic force on the attention of members. If the obsession\nof a particular idea in one mind is traceable to the intense\nenergy exerted by some other mind at a distance, with a view\nto the obsession, is it contrary to reason to conclude that\nsomething of this kind takes place in a certain class of prayers ?\nI am thinking now of only one branch of prayer action, the\nterrene ; but it does seem probable that if a hundred or two\nhundred persons in Wales were for years desiring a particular\nline of action, and spent a great deal of time in express\ning their desire, the force so generated and directed could\nhardly fail to reach and move some sympathetic minds within\nthe same area. We are very far from understanding the laws\nof telepathy, but our limited knowledge even of its facts points\nin the direction I have indicated. Finding in the course of\nmy inquiry that the revival had \"caught on\" in some places,\nin others had but limited success, and elsewhere failed iguo-\nminiously, I tried to discover what prayer-preparation had\ntaken place in the several localities, and no one in Wales\nwill, I think, dispute my conclusion that speaking generally\nthe results corresponded to the preparation. In one town the\nconversions in the chapels attended by Evan Roberts were fewer\nthan in others where he was not present, and for the same\nreason,\u2014difference in the amount of preparation.\nWhether by prayer or other means, the creation of expect\nancy would seem to be necessary to success. I attended\nRoberts' services at Siloam, Swansea, for a whole Sunday.\nMeetings had been going on there daily for five weeks before\nhis arrival (beginning nearly as soon as his meetings at Loug-\nhor), and I found in the packed mass of 800 or 900 people\nin the Chapel, exactly that air of feverish expectancy which\nmade all present susceptible to the suggestion power of a man\n\f88 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nlike the revivalist. It was a new experience to me to hear\na large crowd sing over and over again for 15 or 20 minutes,\nwithout a moment's pause, the refrain : Diolch iddo, diolch iddo,\nByth am gofio llwch y llawr (Thanks to Him : always for\nremembering the dust of earth.)\nOne able correspondent whose name, were I allowed to give\nit, would carry great weight (he is a Welshman), says that\nsome of the scenes witnessed are in part due to the hysterical\nexcitement caused by expectation. I need not detain you\nwith a description of a revival service : it must suffice to say\nthat even in the most orderly meetings confusion reigns, yet\nthere is no sense of confusion. Roberts generally preaches\nbut little, sometimes not at all. His part is to ascertain at\nintervals the peculiar temperament present in the congregation\nas a whole, or in its parts, and then to guide it into corre\nspondence with his own standard of what it ought to be.\nIf you have watched a skilled workman bringing a lump of\nheated metal or other material into a required form, you can\nconceive what Roberts does with his meetings. One shrewd\nobserver, a Welshman, writes to me thus : (The account which\nis given in full in the Appendix (4) is abridged here.) \" The five\nmeetings I attended were in different places, under different\ncircumstances, and each meeting had a complexion entirely its\nown. But I detected a uniform method. Evan Roberts tests a\nmeeting before he begins to speak. What provokes his hearers\nseems to me the clearest explanation of his success in bringing\neach meeting to a dramatic and successful climax. His apparent\nindifference and immobility, before he says anything, breaks\nup all the composure an audience can command. Add to this\nhis habit of transfixing each and every person with his homage-\ncompelling gaze. He reviews methodically the rows of faces ;\nit is the look of a practised physician. By the time he speaks\nhe has made a mental census of the audience. He knows\nwho are ill at ease, he predicts conversions, he detects hind\nrances. A man of faith, doubtless, relying on the promptings\nof the Holy Spirit, but not neglectful of all the data available\nby human means. He makes the audience reveal itself, and\nthen tells the people what they knew already, but they are\npuzzled and staggered by the fact that this meteoric stranger\nshould know them so well. In three of his break-downs or\n\f1J.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 89\nnervous collapses that I witnessed, I was near enough to render\nfirst-aid if necessary, and could not believe that he was sham\nming. Twice I saw him place his hand on his neck, as if\npressing something down. There was a jerking back of the\nhead, such as I have noticed in persons whose nervous systems\nare somewhat deranged.\"\nMy correspondent knew nothing of the accident in Roberts'\nboyhood ; his idea of a physical cause for the nervous tremors\nis therefore all the more noteworthy. The followers of Evan\nattribute these mild tremors to Divine influence, and I think\nhe shares their belief, but true to our line, we must exhaust\nthe nearer probabilities before going elsewhere.\nRoberts certainly possesses a strong power of suggestion,\nis very sensitive to a certain class of telepathic influences, and\nhas a genius for religion, but has not, by any sign that I\ncan read, a trace of multiple personality in active operation.\nSome account must be taken of the inner voice he claims\nas his guide. We are all familiar with what Mr. Myers\nwrote on Socrates and his Daemon in Human Personality, Vol.\nII., sects. 812 et seqq., and the parallel between the philosopher\nand the revivalist is on some points remarkably complete.\nIn Roberts' case the Spirit tells him when to speak and when\nto be silent, to whom he may grant an audience and whom\nhe must refuse, what places to visit and the places he must\navoid. Without any previous warning the inner voice com\npelled him to remain silent for seven days from February\n23rd to March 1st. On the 22nd he was preparing to go from\nNeath to Briton Ferry when suddenly the voice said : \" Don't\ngo.\" He obeyed, and remained in one room for the seven\n\u2022days without uttering a word even to the girl revivalist who\ntook his frugal meals to him. The few communications that\npassed were made in writing. I have ascertained from the\npeople in whose house he was staying that they never heard\nhim once praying or reading aloud. The story of those seven\ndays is given in full in the Western Mail reprint for March 3rd,\n1905, and I quote extracts from these in (5). He had one\nvision during this period, a revelation of the imperfect spiritual\ncondition of a certain group of people. If you read the\naccounts of all that he went through in public from September\n1904, to February 20th. 1905, you will not be surprised that\n\f90 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\ntired nature asserted itself and demanded rest. Not all of us\nhave the courage to obey nature's warnings so implicitly and\nimmediately.\nThe short pithy messages that Roberts gives his friends and\naudiences as from the Spirit are, so far as can be discerned,\nnot more remarkable than might be expected from a man\nwhose mind is saturated with Biblical knowledge, and who\npossesses great native shrewdness and penetration. It is right\nto mention that few men have more resolutely withstood the\ntemptation to be lionised. Whatever may happen, he will not\nbe the idol of the hour, and people who have crossed Con\ntinents to see him iu private have had to return unsatisfied.\nA great deal has been said of his power of prediction. It\nappears to be exercised chiefly in pointing out where coming\nconverts are to be found in this or that part of a chapel\nmeeting. He is nearly always found to be right at the time,\nand if his statement is not verified or justified immediately,\nit has been afterwards. Numerous as such instances are, we\nmay not be disposed to attach much weight to this feature\nof his work, since it is obvious that in a huge gathering of\nthe kind many are present who are susceptible to a \" con\nverting \" influence. But one case of prediction deserves\nnotice. At Liverpool (6) on one occasion Roberts refused to\nleave the building, when the service had been declared closed\nby the ministers, because he said that one man in an indi\ncated gallery, a Welshman, he was certain had not confessed\nChrist as he ought to have done. The minister in charge of\nthat gallery \" tested \" the people and reported that every one\nhad confessed Christ. Roberts was not satisfied : six times\nwas the appeal made during the next 25 minutes and not\nuntil the sixth test did a man come forward and admit that\nhe had not been sincere in professing as a convert with the\nrest. Roberts directed the minister to speak to the man, and\nafter a short talk he too gave in. We can only assume that\nRoberts' sensitiveness to deceptive, hostile, or sympathetic\nthought is abnormally developed. Many public speakers are\naware of the temper or attitude of an audience before any\noutward sign of it has been given.\nAmongst the records in the Appendix (7) will be found\nTO cases of possibly telepathic influence.\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 91\nEvan Roberts has not escaped criticism as to his predic\ntions and declarations of hostile influence. What one critic\nat Dowlais and others at Liverpool said may be read in the\nreprints.\nI now pass on to other features of the Revival.\nSome letters have appeared in the newspapers on the\nwonderful eloquence displayed by unlettered persons in prayer\nand speaking, and not a few men have claimed that the elo\nquence is proof of direct Divine inspiration. I have inquired\ninto this and find that for the most part the eloquence con\nsisted in a number of persons being able under the excite\nment of the moment and the contagion of crowds to express\nthemselves with unusual fluency, but nearly always in the\nwords of the Bible or hymns which they have learned and\nknown from infancy (8). It is not a Sais but a Celt who\nwrites thus\u2014\" Excite a Welshman and he is not responsible\nfor much that he does. If you can tell me exactly how\nit is that a Welshman is more susceptible to physical\nemotion than an Englishman, you have no difficulty in com\nprehending the secret of the Revival. . . . My wife happened\nto get a bit excited at a parish meeting two years ago and\nwell-nigh staggered me and others with her eloquence. Under\nthe impulse of the moment she spoke splendidly and made a\ngreat impression. She had never spoken in public before and\nnothing has occurred since to incite her into eloquence.\"\nWithout further discussion we may accept as the only con\nclusion warranted by the facts that as the Welsh are by\nnature emotional, enthusiastic, ready speakers as a rule, and\npossess a language that almost of itself invites eloquence by\nthe stately roll , of its open vowels and musical syllables, it\nis not surprising that those who are stirred to the depths of\ntheir feelings should break out into fervent utterance of the\nsonorous periods they have taken in with their mother's milk.\nThere are several cases reported of persons unable in ordinary\nconversation to speak without stammering who spoke with\nfluency and ease in prayer in public ; but such instances of\ndefective muscular power being made good under excitement\nare not confined to the Revival and are easily explainable.\nDr. Starbuck in his Psychology of Religion discusses the\nrelative values of the various motives to conversion. I must\n\f92 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nrefer you to his tables and lists, but it is worth notice that\nin Wales, during this Revival, the motive of fear has found\nbut a small place, if any at all. The burden of Evan Roberts'\nteaching is love and gratitude, obedience and personal service,\nand joy. In the statements made to me by many I meet\nfrequently with the remark\u2014\" I felt full of love and joy, I\ncould love everybody.\" And no one, whatever his views of\nthe movement as a whole, can regret hearing that many\nreconciliations have been effected.\nFrom two very different and widely separated districts I\nhave reports that a distinct change of countenance took place\nin some of the persons affected. A friend (8) says that\n\" Young people became pale and their eyes wore a far-away\nlistless look. One said that for days after he had prayed\nhe saw people move like ghosts in the street, and he thought\nthere was a thick mist.\" Another writes\u2014\" I have been\nstruck by one gir1's changed appearance during these months.\nHer expression has become much more gentle, her face, pre\nviously coarse, has become quite refined. As a man expressed\nit to me\u2014she has a Madonna-like face.\"\nI have met with no cases of levitation.\nOne of the most striking narratives received comes from\nnear Aberdare. The writer, a collier, gives an account of his\nstudies in psychology and the numerous books he had read\nbefore the Revival. He was secretary of the local Ethical\nSociety and attended the Revival services purely as a critic.\nHe wanted to know how \" the moral consciousness became\ncentrified into the conscience of these people.\" The story\nand results of his investigations are given in the Appendix (9),\nand it is important to note that the record is one extending\nfrom November 14th to March 4th\u2014within a few days of\nfour months. He gives instances of telepathy, of the hindrance\n(o conversions through the presence of sceptics at the meet\nings, of a case of access of physical strength during religious\nexcitement, and of his own experience of a \" voice.\" Taken\nas a whole it is the most interesting of all the communica\ntions received.\nNo doubt there have been many other cases of apparent\ntelepathy connected with the Revival. I quote two received;\nif others come to hand they will be reported as usual to\n\fLi.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival, 93\nthe Society. The first occurred in the Llynfi Valley. A\nyoung man at a Revival service was suddenly seized with an\nirresistible impulse to pray for his father, although he knew of\nno particular reason why he should do so. The father up to\nthat time, living about 16 miles away, was iu good health.\nThe next morning the young man had a telegram to say\nthat his father had died suddenly. The case is given in full\nin the Appendix (8).\nThe second happened in an adjoining valley. On Decem\nber 27th, 1904, as on other days that week, there were\nlong services held at a Church three times each day for the\nsake of the persons who had been won in the Revival.\nThe wife of the layman who had charge of some of the\nservices objected to her husband's prolonged absence from\nhome, and told him that if he had pleasure in the Church\nhe should have none at home, so she started the weekly\nwash. On going to the wash-tub, she says, \" There before\nme appeared the four children, and one of them spoke to me\nD English saying\u2014' Mam, come,' and then they disappeared.\nI could hear the singing of the hymn, ' O Paradise,' until it\ndied away in the distance.\" The four children had died in\ninfancy.\nThe husband's report is that at the time of the vision he\nwas in the Church praying for his wife, but without any\nthought of the children then or at any time of the day.\nThere was no singing in the Church at the time. His\nprayer was that God would give his wife a desire to go\nto the meetings. On his return she asked what was the\nmatter with him, as he looked confused. He saw a change in\nher, and he believed that God had revealed Himself to her.\nShe cried, went with him to the services, but said nothing\nabout the vision until late that night. Clearly the case\nbelongs to the class of visualised mental impressions of which\nwe have many recorded. See Appendix (10) for the full\naccount.\nThe Vicar of Llangadfan reports that three of his parish\nioners, whose names are given, heard bells chiming during\nservice on Sunday morning, January 29th, 1905. The sound\nwas over their heads, but no one else in the congregation\nheard it. Another parishioner on the previous Wednesday\n\f94 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nheard what appeared to him as a thunder clap followed by\nlovely singing in the air. On Saturday the 14th of January\na workman returning from work between 7 and 8 heard some\nstrange music, similar to that caused by the vibration of\ntelegraph wires, only much louder. The hill where he was\nis far from any trees or wires of any kind. And yet\nanother man heard one evening iu February some lovely\nsinging on the road about half a mile from his house : it\nfrightened him very much.\nThe names are all given, but verification other than the\nVicar's is impossible without a personal interview. Whatever\nthe explanation of this series of happenings, I think the\nevidence is trustworthy. Most of the persons concerned were\nmen. See Appendix (11).\nThe Vicar of a parish in Cardiganshire (12) was riding, a\nfew days before Christmas 1904, to visit some parishioners\nwho lived three miles up the hillside. As he was ascending\nhe heard voices singing ; he thought at first that it was pure\nfancy and took little notice. Gradually the voices seemed to\nincrease in volume until they became overpowering. He tried\nto imagine that it could be nothing outside himself, but the\nharmony seemed to be borne in on him entirely from without.\nIt was as real to his senses as anything he ever heard and\nthe words were distinct, in Welsh. The refrain was started\nagain and again, each time with increased power. Arrived at\nhis destination the singing ceased suddenly. He does not\nremember that he ever heard the same words sung as he\nheard them that day, and it is the only experience of the\nkind that he has had. Many of us know what it is to be\nhaunted by a tune or phrase until by a strong effort of the\nwill we rid ourselves of it, and that one whose mind has\nbeen occupied with revival music should have a more vivid\nexperience of the kind is perhaps not very extraordinary.\nAmongst the narratives deposited in the office of the\nS.P.R. is a long one from a young man in Glamorgan whose\nconversion attracted more than usual notice. From his story\nI will only quote what belongs to this section on sounds.\nOne night he had spoken at a meeting but felt afterwards\nthat he had said something detrimental to the cause, and he\ndetermined not to speak again. He proceeds\u2014\" I reached\n\fI.I.] Psychological Axpecte of the Welsh Revival. 95\nhome at 1 1 very tired, with no appetite for supper. I laid\non the couch but instantly felt full of the Spirit and on fire.\nIt was so hot that I had to go outside, although the fire was\nnearly out. I went to bed about 12. I was sleepy but was\nnot allowed to sleep. I heard a voice speaking distinctly.\nThe Spirit said (in Welsh)\u2014' You said to-night that you\nwill not speak for Me again.' This was repeated several\ntimes. I answered\u2014' You know very well that I cannot\nspeak, that I have nothing to say.' The Spirit\u2014' I have a\nmessage, I want you to deliver it, and that in the most\npublic place.' 'What is it?' The Spirit\u2014'Tell them that\nhypocrisy is the worst sin against Me, and that there is not\na hope of a hypocrite receiving a blessing from Me.' I went\nnow to think over the message. The Spirit again\u2014' You\nhave not said whether you will say it or not.' I promised\nI would. I said\u2014' Let me sleep now.' But I was not\nallowed. ... I doubted whether it was the Holy Spirit.\nHe then said\u2014' Don't you remember Me coming to you\nin Trinity Chapel, and that quite plainly ? ' I was convinced\nand the next night delivered the message. That night I felt\nthe presence of the Spirit but heard no voice. I had a\nvision, it was a beautiful light, pure, and brighter than any\nlight I have ever seen, and clusters of something very soft\nand white falling upon me gently and covering me all over.\nI called them blessings.\" Another night he saw a stick\ngiven to him as a help in rough places. Again he saw\ndown an abyss, and marks as if some one had fallen down\ninto it. Next morning he heard of the death of a woman\nwho had delayed repentance. His other dreams related need\nnot detain us ; they have all the same character of being\nmental images formed by the reflections of the subliminal self\nupon things that had occurred to him, or perhaps that were\npassing through other minds possibly in telepathic contact\nwith his own.\nIn another town a young man who, through inability to accept\nthe Creed, and for other causes, had been an irregular attendant\nat Church, was present at a Ilevival service during which he\nsaw a lighted candle emerge from the font and the figure of\nan angel shielding it with his wing from the draught that\ncame from the open door. The flame was very small, and\nG\n\f96 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nthe least breath of wind would have extinguished it but for\nthe protecting wing. Before the service was ended he gave\nhis adhesion to the Church. The imagery of a tiny flame*\nas representing little faith, might well occur on such an\noccasion. This case is included in Appendix (8).\nA resident in a Cardiganshire village on the night of\nDecember 12, 1904, was walking along the high road when\nhe saw a faint light playing over his head. As it came\nnearer it increased in size, and thinking he was deceived he\nclosed his eyes, but the light continued. Opening his eyes\nagain he saw the light again as it were a man's body in a\nshining robe. The figure had wings, it did not touch the\nground. He looked at the hand and saw the prints of\nthe wounds. He shouted\u2014\" O my Jesus,\" and the figure\nascended out of sight. He felt filled with love, and from\nthat time he can love every one without difference. In the\nlight of the vision there succeeded a view of the world as a\nwild wilderness. In answer to questions this correspondent\nsays that never before had he had an experience like it : the\nvision was in silence. His wife has had some wonderful\nexperiences, but the account of these is not forthcoming (13).\nA young man in Glamorgan having been much influenced\nby the Revival determined to do a certain thing unnamed. He\nfailed to fulfil his promise and then when he tried to pray\nthere came a reiterated vision of a large white throne empty,\nbut with the word \" Disobedience \" written across the front in\nblack letters. Obedience caused this vision to cease (14).\nA woman at Dyffryn writes that at the beginning of the\nyear she was praying at midnight in a room without a light\nwhen suddenly she found herself in a glorious place in the\nmidst of song and praise, but she saw no one. Thereupon a\nbright light entered the room in the shape of the Ark and\nMercy Seat. It shone brilliantly, she thought there was but\na thin veil between herself and the eternal world : and all\npassed away. She had a vision of Christ three years ago. I\nasked whether the vision of the Ark was like any picture of\nit that she had ever seen, and as her answer was \" Yes,\" we\nmay place this incident amongst the cases of mental imagery,\nthe mind utilising stored-up impressions.\nIn all these instances we have to remember that according\n\fPsychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival 97\nas individual idiosyncrasies and mental habits vary, so do the\noutcomes of suggestions and impressions. In some they are\nvisualised, in others auditised, and again in some the bodily\ntemperature is affected with no formation of an image or a\nsound heard. We may suppose that the whole of the mental\nand nervous apparatus within the subject is operative in these\noccurrences.\nHaving heard that the Revival had caused an increase of\nlunacy I asked the Medical Superintendent of the Glamorgan\nCounty Asylum for his opinion. From his report (15) I\nlearn that the increase of insanity cannot be attributed to\nthe Kevival, for \" in only one per cent, of the admissions was\nreligious excitement deemed to be a contributory factor in\nthe causation.\" This was in the last quarter of 1904 and\nthe same result has been found in 1905.\nI now come to that part of the subject which has per\nhaps caused more excitement in the public mind than any\nother feature of the Revival. All my readers must have heard\nof the mysterious lights in Merionethshire associated with the\nname of Mrs. Jones of Islawrffordd, near Dyffryn. This good\nlady is, I am told, a very simple, quiet person, whose life\nuntil recently has been passed in obscurity. Some time ago\nshe read Sheldon's book, In His Steps, and was much moved\nby it. She determined to work for the spiritual good of her\nneighbours, and she began her ministry early in December, 1904.\nThe story is that she is attended by lights of various kinds\nwherever she goes, and, as I shall show presently, there is\nmore in this personal attention than might be supposed. I\nam spared the necessity of giving minute details, since Mr.\nBeriah G. Evans, a Carnarvon journalist, has taken care to\ninform the world as to the lights, and his account of what he\nand others have seen may be read in The Occult Review for\nMarch, April, and June, 1905. The numbers are in the S.P.R.\nLibrary. It is important to notice that the coast in the\nneighbourhood of Dyffryn has been favoured or disfavoured\nwith lights of many shapes and sizes in former times. Pennant\nin his Tour in Wales gives a full account of the appearances\nof mischievous blue flames that alarmed people and did mate\nrial damage near Harlech in 1694. Lights of a blue colour\nappeared also in the neighbourhood of Pwllheli in 1875, and\n\f98 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\nthe publication of Mr. Picton-Jones' account of what he then\nsaw elicited from a correspondent the relation of a similar\noccurrence in 1869 or 1870. Again in 1877 lights of various\ncolours were seen moving over the estuary of the Dysynni.\nThrough the kindness of the editor of the Oswestry Advertizer\nI have received the extracts from his \" Bye-gones \" columns,\nwhich give the notes on lights for the three years 1869,\n1876, and 1877. These are quoted in my Appendix (16).\nI am not satisfied with the investigations that have taken\nplace, and I think now, as I did at the first, that the Society\nmight well employ a geological expert to go over the district\nand discover, if possible, what conditions are present favour\nable to the natural production of incandescent vapours. Mr.\nBernard B. Redwood (son of the well-known scientific expert,\nSir Boverton Redwood) was sent down by the Daily Mail in\nFebruary, 1905, but his report,1 which I give in the Appen\ndix (17), is not to me conclusive. He planned his investigation\non the supposition of electrical disturbance, and I am not\nsurprised that he was disappointed at the result He says,\nwith more approximation to what I think is the cause of\nsome of the lights, that it is just possible that there may\nhave been some lights caused by spontaneous ignition of phos-\nphuretted hydrogen generated in the marsh at Egryn and\ndistorted by mist. He adds that \" Methane or marsh gas is\nnever self-ignited, and may be left out of the question.\" With\nhis personal opinion of Mrs. Jones I am not disposed to\nagree ; but granting its truth, we have still to reckon with\nthe witnesses I shall quote as to the reality of both subjective\nand objective lights. The evidence received I proceed to give,\nfirst, however, stating my conviction that Merionethshire has\nbeen the scene of late of a large amount of exaggeration and\nmisconception, and perhaps trickery. But having made all\nallowance for persons who mistook meteors, brightly-shining\nplanets, farm lanterns, railway signals, and bodies of ignited\ngases for tokens of heavenly approval of Mrs. Jones and the\nRevival, there remain sufficient instances of abnormal phenoiueua\nto encourage further inquiry. Evidence of misapprehensions I\nhave received.\n1 This report was not published in the Daily Mail, but Mr. Redwood\nkindly sent a copy of it to us.\u2014Editor.\n\fLi.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 99\nA vicar in the neighbourhood has sent me the following :\n\" A very reliable man informed me that one morning last\nweek [in February, 1905] on looking out through his bedroom\nwindow about 6 a.m. he saw some remarkable lights rising\nover the marsh indicating a wave, bluish colour, and ascend\ning up into the heavens and vanishing away, but he did not\nin any way connect the light with the Revival in any shape\nor form.\"\nCorrespondents from whom I have managed to obtain evidence\nrelate various experiences. Mrs. Jones of Islawrffordd wrote\non January 16th, 1905: \"I have seen [the light] every night\nfrom the beginning of the Revival about six weeks ago.\nSometimes it appears like a motor-car lamp flashing and going\nout, and injures nothing at all ; other times like two lamps\nand tongues of fire all round them, going out in one place\nand lighting again in another place far off sometimes ; other\ntimes a quick flash and going out immediately, and when the\nfire goes out a vapour of smoke comes in its place ; also a\nrainbow of vapour and a very bright star.\" She said that\nthe lights were always seen out of doors, and at about six\no'clock in the evening. I asked if they had been seen by any\none who had not been converted, and the answer was \" Yes.\"\nA man at Dolgau says (January 25th, 1905): \"We have\nnot seen it now for a fortnight. We saw it for eight nights\nsome time back at about 11 o'clock. We were afterwards a\nweek without seeing it, and then we saw it once more. . . .\nIt was very like the light of a lamp, but not so bright, and\nappeared to me to move gradually. Once I saw it move\nswiftly. It was in a place where there was no light to be.\nIt appeared very low down, along the ground, I should think.\"\nIn reply to queries he says that the colour was a weak\nwhite light, always very much the same ; it appeared at first\naccidentally, it was not expected. There is a ditch running\nthrough a ravine near the spot.\nAnother correspondent says that only once did he see the\nlight, on January 2nd, 1905. \"It was hovering above a\ncertain farmhouse, and it appeared to me as three lamps\nabout three yards apart, in the shape of a Prince of Wales's\nfeathers, very brilliant and dazzling, moving and jumping like\na sea-wave under the influence of the sun on a very hot day.\n- M \\ o \u2022 \u2022 i\nOllt >ri\u00bb,>.\n\f100 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nThe light continued so for ten minutes. All my family saw\nit the same time. It was 10.40 p.m. at the time.\" My ques\ntions were treated by him as evidence of utter unbelief, and\nrepeated requests for further information met with refusals.\nA young woman of some education wrote (February 4th,\n1905): \"I saw the light you refer to one night in the\nbeginning of January [between 10 and 10.30 p.m.]. At first\nI saw two very bright lights, about half a mile away \" [it was\nbetween Dyffryn and Llanbedr], \" one a big white light, the\nother smaller and red in colour. The latter flashed backwards\nand forwards, and finally seemed to become merged in the\nother. Then all was darkness again. It did not appear iu\nthe same place again, but a few minutes after we saw another\nlight which seemed to be a few yards above the ground. It\nnow looked like one big flame, and all around it seemed like\none big glare of light. It flamed up and went out alternately\nfor about ten minutes, very much in the same way as some\nlighthouses.\"\nIt is probable that the two persons whose accounts I have\njust given saw the same light from different points of view.\nOn December 22nd, 1904, at 5.18 p.m., another deponent\nsaw, in company with two other persons, a large light \" about\nhalf way from the earth to the sky, ou the south side of\nCapel Egryn, and in the middle of it something like [a]\nbottle or black person, also some little lights scattering around\nthe large light in many colours. Last of all the whole thing\ncame to a large piece of fog, out of sight.\"\nAnother writer, whose account is given in the Appendix (18),\ndescribes the light as a pillar of fire, quite perpendicular, about\ntwo feet wide and three yards in height.\nA correspondent whose opinion, from his position in relation\nto some of the persons quoted, I am disposed to trust, says\nthat the prevailing view in the neighbourhood is that the\nlights seen along the coast from Towyn to Portmadoc by scores\nof people at divers times between 6 p.m. and midnight, and\nin divers forms, are phosphorescent lights, not associated with\nany person or building. The light has been seen by many,\nChapel members and non-members alike, and at the same time,\nwhether Mrs. Jones be at home or away. About Mrs. Jones's\nown experiences he declines to express an opinion.\n\f\f\fXi.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 101\nLengthy communications from a husband and wife at Har-\nlech, on the same coast, given in the Appendix (19), contain\nsimilar evidence, and some account of earnest endeavours to\nsee the lights in Mrs. Jones's presence.\nI need not refer to other communications received from the\nneighbourhood of \"Welshpool, save to point out that this locality\nis several miles away from the other, and yet the descriptions\n\u2022of lights are to some extent similar.\nOn Wednesday, June 21st, 1905, I interviewed a medical\nman in the Rhondda fach, who saw on May 27th, at night, a\nglobe of light about the size of a cheese plate, or nearly the\napparent diameter of the moon, over the chapel where Mrs.\nJones was that evening preaching. He made sure by com\nparing this light with the gas lamps within sight, that it was\nnot an ordinary lamp. I have had a photograph taken from\nthe very spot where the doctor stood when he and his wife\nsaw the light, and have marked on it the place where the\nlight appeared (see Plate I.). As may be seen from this photo\ngraph, the background of the chapel, as viewed from the house\nfront, is the other side of the narrow valley, the black mark\nbeing just over the flat roof of a house on the further side\nof the street below. Now it is quite possible that some\none willing to deceive his neighbours might have perched him\nself on the mountain side with a powerful lamp ; but why,\nin that case, he should select a position from which the light\ncould only appear to be right over the chapel to a very few\npersons, those in or in front of the uppermost terrace of houses,\n-and why he should expose the light only for a few minutes,\nare points that require explanation. The doctor is in sympathy\nwith Mrs. Jones, and when he informed her that he had seen\nthis light she declared that she had also seen it, but from\nwithin the chapel. This case is given in full in the Appen\ndix (20).\nA second account of a light appearing in the same valley,\nabout half a mile lower down, and on the opposite side of\nthe valley, at a much later hour, is also given in the Appendix\n(21). This light was somewhat similar to one seen in North\nWales, of which the account is given in (18),\u2014a column of fire\nabout two feet wide and several feet high, of the tint of a\nfiery vapour.\n\f102 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nFrom the same locality two other accounts (22) have been\nsent to me of lights seen about the same time by two women.\nNow here are four narratives from the Rhondda fach, but\nof the six persons who witnessed the lights four are known\nto be North Walians, like Airs. Jones herself, and I think this\nfact tends to support my theory that persons of the same\nrace or tribe have similar modes of mental action. The cases of\ncollective hallucinations quoted, so far as they are genuine, have\na strong family likeness, and as the seers are all in sympathy\nwith Mrs. Jones, probably her mind is the originating cause\nof the appearances. In my correspondence with these light-\nseers I have made a point of asking whether they had any of\nthem ever seen a corpse light (canwyll gorph). Not one of\nthem had done so, some of the witnesses had not even heard\nof such a thing. The persons who see the corpse light are,\nI believe, not from North Wales, but from Cardiganshire, and\npossibly are Iberian in race. Professor Barrett has traced the\ndowsing faculty to Somersetshire, and if the various forms of\nlights seen in Wales could be properly classified we should\nno doubt find that as the race-origin so the light-form.\nI also suggest a connection between the naturally-caused\nlights which have appeared frequently along the coast of\nTremadoc Bay, from Pwllheli round to Barmouth, and the\nforms of the subjective appearances which have been described.\nThe traditional, collective memory of the objective lights may act\nas a guide to the imagination, providing it with materials for\npicture formation when it is stimulated by a sufficiently exciting\ncause. Mental imagery can only employ stored-up impressions ;\nhowever incongruous the various elements, they all may be\ndrawn upon when occasion serves, and the lights of Dyffryu\nare sufficiently common and familiar to become the mnemonic\nmaterial of religiously excited minds. Mrs. Jones' obiter dictum,\n\" lamp flashing and going out and injuring nothing at all,\" reads\nlike a reflection of the sub-conscious memory upon the lights\nof 1694, which did injure material objects. Of those lights and\ntheir effects Mrs. Jones had most probably read or heard.\nThe motor car association would not suggest injury, because\nwhatever mischief motor cars may do, their brilliant lamps are\nnot the causes of the mischief.\nThere was a rumour of trickery in the Rhondda fach : some\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of tlie Welsh Revival. 103\nsaid that young men had got on to the flat roof of a house,\n\u2014the only flat roof of a dwelling house that commands a view\nof the chapel, Libanus\u2014and caused a light to be projected\nfrom it on to the chapel roof or over it. I went to the\nhouse and the proprietor told me that he had gone on to the\nflat roof to watch for the lights. He had a small lantern for\nguidance, as the roof is dangerous, having no parapet, but it\nwould not be possible with so small a lamp to throw a beam of\nlight or create a disc such as the doctor and his wife saw. The\nspot where the doctor stood, the flat roof, and the chapel form\na triangle with the chapel at the apex. Three other instances\nof lights seen are given in the Appendix (23), (24), (25).\nBy way of assisting towards a solution of this matter of the\nlights, I have added (26) to the letters from Wales a communi\ncation from a friend who saw at a stance held by eight\npersons, in a totally dark room, some years ago, five little\nlights slowly gyrating near the ceiling of the room. The\nhypothesis of fraud in this case he dismisses with contempt.\nIf we can gather accounts of any considerable number of\nsimilar instances in experiments or stances where the mediums\nmay be trusted, we may arrive at the causes of Mrs. Jones's\nlight manifestations.\nI have taken care to ask in which cases the lights seen\nilluminated surrounding objects, and whether persons not dis\ntinctly religious saw them. The answers prove that illumina\ntion of walls, buildings, and hedges took place in some\ninstances, and if so we may dismiss these at once as purely\nphysical, not psychical. I believe a genuine psychical light\nhas no power of itself to illuminate distinctly any external\nobjects. A room may appear to be flooded with light, but I\ndo not find that the furniture is made more apparent.1\nA complete review of the whole subject of the Revival at\nthis point is not desirable, even if it were possible. We need\nfar more inquiry, more examination of more witnesses, time\nfor comparison, also, of the various phenomena with themselves\nand with other events in former days. But I hope enough\nhas been said to encourage some of our members to study\nthese spiritual movements without prejudice of any kind, and\n1This question is discussed in the \"Report on the Census of Hallucinations,\"\nProceedings, VoL X., pp. 81-82. \u2014EDITOR.\n\f104 Rev.

[PART\nwith the certainty that no time is lost which man can devote to\nthe separation of truth from deception, the deliverance of reason\nfrom passion, and the clearance of faith from superstition.\nA few weeks after the above paper was written I heard\nof the appearance of \"lights\" at Ynysybwl, a small colliery\ntown a few miles north of Pontypridd, Glam., and on\nAugust 2nd, 1905, I visited the town to interview some of\nthe percipients. Mrs. Jones of Egryn preached at Ynysybwl\non July 4th, 5th and 6th, but there is no trustworthy evi\ndence of lights being seen before July 23rd. On that evening\nseveral persons went to Ynysyboeth to hear Mrs. Jones\nonce more and by all accounts they were very much affected\nby the service. On their return to Ynysybwl they held an\nopen-air meeting, at about 10.30 p.m., in the open space\nknown as Robert Town Square. The religious fervour was\nintense and the service lasted until 1 a.m. One correspondent\n(see 27o) reports that his attention was called, during the\nservice, to a \" ball of light about the size of the moon,\" with\n\u2022a slight mist over it. Then stars began to shoot out around\nit, the light rose higher and grew brighter but smaller.\nAnother at the same gathering describes the light as a\n\" block of fire \" rising from the mountain side and moving\nalong for about 200 or 300 yards. It went upwards, a star\n\" shot out to meet it, and they clapped together and formed\ninto a ball of fire.\" The form changed into something like\nthe helm of a ship. The appearance lasted about a quarter of\nan hour. This deponent went home to fetch his wife to see\nthe light, but from his house he saw nothing, although the\nhouse faces the same mountain side. Returning to the square\nhe again saw it (see 27i). A third witness says that the\nlight was a ball of fire, \"glittering and sparkling,\" and it\nseemed to be \"bubbling over\" (27c). A Mrs. J. and her\ndaughters saw the light at 12.30 a.m. as a ball of fire, white,\nsilvery, vibrating, stationary. Mrs. J. also saw two streamers\nof grey mist emanating from the ball and in the space\nbetween them a number of stars (27rf). The daughter saw\nnothing of the stars, but remarks, as no one else does, that\ntfie form became oval instead of round (27c). In conversation\nthey told me also that the ball decreased in size.

It will be\nsufficient here to point out that whilst all the witnesses saw\na ball of fire, each saw something in connection therewith\nnot mentioned by the others. All agree in thinking that the\nduration of the light was from 10 to 15 minutes, but whether\n\" vision \" minutes are of the same duration as those of solar\ntime remains to be proved. There is no evidence that any one\nconsulted a watch or clock to mark the time that really elapsed.\nOn July 2Gth, at a meeting of the Salvation Army, in the\nsame square, Mr. D. D. tells me that he saw over a wood on\nthe mountain side a black cloud from which emerged first a\nwhite light, then a yellow, and finally a brilliantly red\ntriangle. The vision lasted about 2 minutes (? vision time).\nStanding on the spot whence D. D. saw the succession of\nlights, I noticed that on the hoarding which fences the side\nwalk there were four very prominent posters well within the\ncircle of vision as one looked towards the wood over which\nthe light appeared. The posters, read from left to right, as a\nbook is read, gave exactly the sequence of colours as described.\nThe accompanying view (Plate II.) is marked so as to show\nthe order. But for the lateness of the hour, 10.30 p.m., we\nmight attribute the appearances to a transfer of visual impres\nsions from the hoarding to the sky. In that case, however,\nthe colours seen would have been the compiementaries of those\nactually witnessed. The conclusion is that the colour sequence\nwas mnemonic, the imagination using colour and form materials\nabsorbed during daylight. The triangular form of the third\nlight was a reminiscence either of the upper part of the red\nposter or of the \" Bass \" advertisement on the further right.\nThe photograph was taken close to the spot where D. D. stood.\nThe suggestion of unconscious utilisation of stored impressions\nwill not be thought unreasonable by those who have examined\nmany \" vision \" cases.1 I have ascertained that the posters in\nquestion were all in situ on or before July 23rd.\n1 Cf. cases of \" memory images \" given in Mr. Myers's paper on \" The\nSubliminal Consciousness \" in Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 450-54 ; also iu\nVol. XI., pp. 359-61.\n\f106 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nIn the same town on July 30th at midnight a Mrs. O.,\nwhom I have seen, called the attention of my friend, Mr. J.\nR. J., who lives next door to her, to a ball of fire or torch\nwhich she saw travelling over the hill side to the north of\nYnysybwl, rather more than a mile, as the crow flies, from\nher house. Three relatives of Mrs. O., with her and Mr. J.\nR. J., watched the light moving about in a zig-zag from the\ntop of the hills to the valley below, across fields and hedges,\nfor about 20 minutes. The night was dark; the light went\nout at intervals and reappeared. It does not appear possible\nthat any person could have borne a powerful lamp over the\narea pointed out to me, or have moved from point to point\nso rapidly as the light travelled, the apparent rate being\nsix miles an hour. There is no evidence discoverable of bodies\nof ignited gases having been seen in the locality previously,\nand one of the witnesses was not in the least affected by\nthe Revival efforts of Mrs. Jones. There is no solution of\nthis incident at present. It may have been, as the Robert\nTown Square appearance was, a case of collective hallucina\ntion, but there was no immediate mental excitement at\nwork as on the night of the 23rd. Careful examination of\nthe appended letters can hardly fail to strengthen the idea of\ncollective hallucination modified or tempered by individual\nidiosyncrasies, the originating mind being Mrs. Jones's, in the\ncase of the Robert Town vision. I have taken care not\nto report other reputed light visions of which the testimony\nis not considered, locally, to be worth very much, and it\nmay be well to note that, according to trustworthy information,\nI understand that the ministers of some of the chapels are\nexercising praiseworthy caution in accepting the reports of\nvisions. Their attitude is wholesomely sceptical.\nVisiting the Garw Valley, on the western side of Mid-\nGlamorgan, a few days ago, I interviewed a tradesman who\nalso saw a light or lights after Mrs. Jones's visit to that\nvalley. But his written account has not yet come to hand.\nSeveral correspondents have expressed a desire for some\nsatisfactory explanation of the lights seen in Glamorganshire\nand elsewhere, but, until many more authentic cases of the\nkind are collected and compared, their wish must remain un\nsatisfied.

If they are called\nsubjective, the term must be held only to be equivalent to\nan operation within the physical limits of the percipients, and\nthe lights must be considered in relation to the sounds and\nchanges of bodily temperature experienced by several persons\nelsewhere, as related in this paper and Appendix. In the\nascending scale of vibrations the order is sound, heat, and light\nwaves. Is it probable that persons affected by such stimuli\nas the Revival provided heard, felt, or saw according (1) to\nthe intensity of the stimulus in each case, and (2) to the\nsusceptibility of the percipient ? If one man's mental organs\nwere excited to a certain degree, he would hear a voice ; if\nto a higher degree, he would experience a vision ; either opera\ntion, however, being entirely within the brain of the sub\nject. I advance the theory of physical vibratory operation\nwith considerable hesitation, and only because I am not satis\nfied with the proposal to attribute the occurrences either to\ndiseased imagination (if by that term is meant a species of\nself-deception) or to some mental operation apart or distinct\nfrom the organism by which the mind works. If a sharp\nblow upon a certain portion of the head causes a man to\n\" see stars,\" may it not be possible for a mental stimulus from\nwithout to act in a similar way ? When it is known how\nmind can affect mind at a distance it will be possible, per\nhaps, to explain the operation within a man's self which\ninterprets stimuli now as sound, now as heat, or again in\nvision. My chief concern here is to ask that the three\nkinds of experiences may be examined in correlation and all\nof them with due regard to the ascertained laws of vibration\nand modes of energy. The theory may be put thus :\nA. Agent, exercising influence and suggesting form.\nB. Recipient of mental stimulus whose brain translates\nthe message into sound, heat, or light form accord\ning to its own capacity of motion.\nIn this inquiry the physical and the psychical cannot safely\nbe dissevered, however necessary it may be to specialise for\nthe sake of adequate research.\n\f108 Rev.

Persons affected by the Revival should be asked to say how\nthe impulse to prayer or song first arose.\n2. It is important to discover, if possible, what circumstances or\npromptings led up to the Revival in various districts.\n3. If eloquence in prayer on the part of unlettered persons has\nbeen noticed, it would be well to find out whether or no the language\nor phraseology was that of the Bible or any other spiritual literature.\n4.

In any case, the observations of recipients of this circular will\nbe of value ; if particular cases of abnormal character are not available,\ngeneral impressions may be sent.\n(2)\nFrom the Rev. I. E., Pontardulais, January 30th, 1905.\nHe gives here a written account of what he related to me in\nOctober, 1904.\n... I have not been there in any of the meetings, and therefore\nthe little knowledge I have concerning it comes from others, which\ncannot be always reliable.\n... I consider the present Revival, or re-awakening or any other\nname that one may choose to call it, is the work of God,\u2014an answer\nto the former prayers of the faithful. No place or man can have\na claim to its beginning. . . .\nHowever, ... I will state what I have heard. Early last year there\nwas a Convention at New Quay which impressed many. Some weeks\nafter a young girl was stirred by a sermon from the Pastor of her\nchapel, and about 9 p.m. she went to the minister's house, saying : \"I\nwant to see you particularly. I have walked about a dozen times\nback and fore in front of your house this evening, afraid to come\nin, yet I could not go home before seeing you. You stated in your\nsermon this evening of a certain state of happiness which every\nChristian could attain. I try to live a Christian life, yet I have never\nattained that state yet.\"\nMinister: \"Is there anything troubling you, or are you afraid that\nyon are not saved 1 \"\nThe Girl: \"No, I am not afraid of losing heaven; but what is it\nto be safe alone, when so many around me are totally regardless of\ntheir own salvation ? What I want is to do more work for Him,\nto have more pleasure in His service, to attain that state you spoke\nabout this evening.\" (She was intensely earnest.)\nMinister-: \"Well, it can be obtained on condition\u2014that you give\nyourself entirely unto Him, and let Him do with you as He pleases.\"\nThe Girl: \"Ah! but He might ask me some difficult things.\n\f110 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nWhat if He asked me to go out to Africa for Him ? I could not\n.lo it.\"\nMinister: \"That is the only condition\u2014He will ask from you\ndifficult things ; undoubtedly He will.\"\nThe Girl: \"Pray for me.\"\nMinister : \" Submit ; submit first.\"\nAfterwards, in a week-night meeting, he asked the members to\ngive their spiritual experience. He beckoned to this girl. She\n\u2022cried, and prayed. Others after came to him, and said that they\nwere pricked by their consciences, and wanted to confess to him\ntheir sins. He said, \"Confess them to God.\" Then things went on\nthere as they are here now.\nAny further information I will most gladly give. I may add that\nI spent a day at Llandrindod last August in the Keswick Con\nference. A clergyman, F. B. Meyer, and Madame Penn-Lewis gave\naddresses. Few attended, yet I felt the same power there\u2014some\nthing unaccountable. Next March Evan Roberts will visit this place\nagain.\n(3)\nFrom Mr. J. P., Headmaster of the school attended by\nEvan lloberts when preparing for the ministry :\nNEWCASTLE EMLYN, June '10th, 1905.\n. . . Mr. Evan Roberts wrote to me from Loughor during my Easter\nholidays 1904, asking for particulars about the school, and stating\nthat he intended coming here the following Summer term. He did\nnot, however, come until the middle of September, 1904\u2014for the\ncommencement of session 1904-'05. During the few weeks that he\nattended school he showed that he had a capacity and aptitude for\nwork considerably above the average. On Friday of the fourth week\nand Monday of the fifth he was absent from school, being confined\nto his room with a very bad cold. On the Sunday Mr. Seth Joshua\ncommenced a week's mission at Bethel C.M. Church, and on Tuesday\nevening several young ladies from New Quay came over to help.\nAfter coming home from the meeting on that night, I heard that\nRoberts had been there too, although his cold was still very bad,\nand I felt annoyed with him, especially when I learnt that he was\nout without an overcoat ! I had no opportunity for \" lecturing \" him\non the matter, until I saw him on the Wednesday night standing up to\nconfess Christ at the invitation of Mr. Joshua. He also came forward\nand knelt in prayer\u2014the most agonising soul-struggle which I had\n\fLi.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. Ill\never witnessed, although I was surprised, when I spoke to him of it\nduring his period of rest at this place before he went to Liverpool,\nthat he had not much recollection of it, owing perhaps to its having\nbeen overshadowed by what transpired at Blaenanerch on the\nfollowing day. It was here that the turning-point came, and, as he\nsays, he was \"bent.\" I should have said that Roberts was accom\npanied from here by many friends, including Mr. Joshua and the\nNew Quay ladies, to Blaenanerch. The meetings that were held\nthere had for their object the deepening of spiritual life and convic\ntion, and were one of a series of very successful conventions held\nby the Calvinistic Methodists of South Cardiganshire in various\nplaces\u2014the first at New Quay some 18 months previously. After\nBlaenanerch, Roberts was here for about three weeks. But I could\nnot get him to come to school. I was terribly anxious about him,\nand liad grave fears for his condition, because at the time I was\ntotally unable to appreciate the mighty forces working in him. I\nknew that he spent almost all his time in prayer, meditation, and\nreading the Bible, but that did not make my anxiety any the less.\nI thought it would be a good thing to get him out of himself, as\nit were. and I used to call with him every morning at his lodgings\nto entreat him to come to school. With smiles and tears inter\nmingled, and genuineness writ plainly on his face, he would say that\nhe was very sorry, but that he was not able to do any school work,\nand that it would be no use for him to come to school in that state.\nHe used to tell me that he loved school work (and I knew it), but\nthat as soon as he would lay hold of a school-book, he felt the\nSpirit coming on him, crushing him, and that it was only by\nI'Utting the book aside that he obtained relief. As he said this, a\ntremor would run through him and his face and neck were seen to\nquiver in a remarkable way. All this, however, only served to\nmake me more earnest than ever in trying to get him to school,\nand one morning I succeeded in inducing him to come with me,\nafter telling him that he need not come up to classes, but might\ngo on with Algebra. I believe that he came to please me, being\nafraid that he might appear obstinate. At least, that is my impres\nsion. That was the last occasion on which he came to school. He\nand Sidney Evans had been invited to a monthly meeting at\nBwkhygroes, and they went on the afternoon of that day. From\nthat time forward he was getting more and more of an enigma to\nme and to all who took an interest in him. About this time he\nbesran to have visions\u2014you have undoubtedly read descriptions of\nH\n\f112 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\nthese in the press\u2014and he related them to my father and others.\nWhile in chapel on Sunday night, he heard a voice calling him to-\ngo home to Loughor to speak to the young people of Moriah (his\nown chapel). He came to my father's house on that night and\nrelated to him his experience. My father at last told him that he\nhad better go to try. But if nobody had told him anything, no-\npower would have held him back. On Monday morning he went\nThe rest of his history you probably know better than I can\ndescribe.\nOn looking back at these strange events, I cannot help being\namused at myself and my anxiety for Roberts. It was very little I\nunderstood how the Spirit of God was working in him for a special\npurpose. It all seems so plain now.\nBehind all this it is important to remember that Roberts was for\n12 or 13 years living in close proximity to God, and that his prayers\nduring that time were fitting him for the great work to which he\nhas been called.\nThere is one point I forgot to mention : When he was here a\nshort time ago, I asked him why he did not come to school directly\nafter he had first written to me. The explanation was that as a\nresult of wrestling with the Spirit the way was not made clear\nfor him. . . .\n(4)\nFrom Mr. J. G., Nantymoel, Glam.\nMay, 1905.\nI attended five meetings conducted by Evan Roberts ; rather, meet\nings in which he took part. The meetings were held in different\nplaces under different circumstances. Each meeting had a complexion\nand a character of its own, essentially different in that respect from\na series of Parochial Mission services. Each meeting stands forth\nin my recollection like a masterpiece in art.\nBut I was able to detect a uniform method in the five meetings ;\nrather, I was able to make out certain things, each and all indispen\nsable apparently, which conditioned each meeting, leaving out of\nconsideration at . present the elements which make every religious\nservice a success.\n(1) The Welsh language was indispensable. In two of the meet\nings, some well-intentioned Englishmen, evidently practised in \"revival\nwork,\" nearly put out what the reporters describe as the \"fire.\"\nBut fortunately Welsh in each case reasserted itself.\n\fPsychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 113\n(2) The meetings revealed the marvellous conformity of the popular\nChristianity of Wales. It is a conformity which is shared by Welsh\nChurchmen as well as Welsh Nonconformists. I refer particularly\nto the\n(a) Use of the same hymns and tunes.\n(6) Scripture knowledge as shown by apt quotation at the impulse\nof the moment.\n(e) A most homogeneous body of revival divinity. No matter to\nwhat sect the speaker belonged, he was orthodoxy itself.\n(3) To this conformity in outward expression must be added the\nwelding power of united prayer, which in each case had preceded\nRoberts' arrival.\n(4) Evan Roberts tests a meeting before he begins to speak.\nWhat is most provoking to many of his hearers seems to me the\nclearest human explanation of his success in bringing each meeting\nto a dramatic and sensational climax. His apparent indifference and\nimmobility for an hour or so before he says anything breaks up all\nthe composure an audience of human beings can command. Add to\nthis his habit of transfixing each and every person present with his,\nnot unpleasant, but homage-compelling gaze. For a long time he\nreviews methodically the rows upon rows of faces. It is the gaze\nof the practised physician. By the time he gets up to speak he\nhas made a mental report or census of his audience. He knows what\nsouls are ill at ease. He predicts conversions, and he detects hin\ndrances. He is doubtless a man of faith, relying on the promptings\nof the Holy Spirit, but he is not a man who neglects picking up\nall the data available by human means concerning the condition of\nhis audience. He first waits for his audience to reveal itself to him,\nand then gets up and tells the people just what they knew already,\nbut they are puzzled and staggered by the fact that this meteoric\nstranger should know them so well. The result in thousands of\ncases is an impression which was the means of reclaiming the woman\nof Samaria (St. John iv. 29, 39), \"He told me all that ever I\ndid.\"\n(5) His \"break-downs,\" or what some of his unsympathetic critics\ncall \"contortions,\" must be taken into account. In three out of five\nmeetings I witnessed three of his nervous collapses, and I was on\neach occasion near enough to him to render \"first-aid\" if necessary.\nI could not believe that he was \" shamming.\" He would cry \" his\nheart out,\" his tears and sobs affecting the most callous present.\nOn two occasions I saw him placing one hand on his neck, as if\n\f114 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\npressing something down, or controlling himself where he felt weakest.\nThere was a jerking backward of the head which, as I am not a\nphysician, I will not venture to describe, but I have noted the same\nthing in persons whose nervous system was somewhat deranged. I\nthink the hand pressing on the neck may be explained in that way.\nSuch involuntary concomitants of the \" collapse \" made me feel quite\nsure that it was a collapse.\nBut though no \" shamming,\" the \" collapse \" was most effective in\nevoking whatever sympathy the audience had hitherto withheld.\nThere was in each case a burst of prayer throughout the building\nwhen the revivalist was in such distress. And as he had a way of\nrecovering suddenly, there was a burst of praise the moment he\nstood up again.\nI write as I observed and felt. A meeting with Evan Roberts\nturns Welsh human nature inside out. I wonder if a bad man,\nhowever clever he might be, could play so effectively with his\naudience. In this case it is most fortunate that the man is thoroughly\ngood, and discreet with the discretion of a saint. So I believe.\n(5)\nReport by \" Awstin,\" special correspondent of the Western\nMail, of interview with Mr. Evan Roberts immediately after\nthe seven days' silence. (Western Mail, March 3rd, 1905).\nMr. Evan Roberts said : \" On the evening of last Wednesday week\nI was getting ready to go to the service at Briton Ferry. I had\nmy overcoat on, my gloves in my hand, and my hat on my head,\nwhen a voice said, ' Don't go.' I ought to have told you that before\nthat, before I came downstairs, while I was washing, a voice had\nsaid in Welsh, 'Paid myn'd i Briton Ferry' ('Don't go to Briton\nFerry '), and then, when I got down to the passage, as I have\ntold you, the voice said, ' Don't go.' We were all ready then, and\nMr. Mardy Davies was here. Then I felt some pressure (a burden)\non my soul. I went back into the room, sat on a chair, and was\ncompelled to pray for the salvation of souls. Then came a second\noutburst, a greater burden than the other, and I was com\npelled to go on my knees in great agony of soul. The voice\ncontinued to say, ' Don't go tonight.' Then I tried to convey the\nmessage to Mr. Mardy Davies, but I failed, so I was compelled\nto write it down. About that time a voice said, 'You are to be\nsilent for seven days.'

The singing was tender and solemn,\nand they cried as they sang, ' One step enough for me.'

He has suggested (this word was doubly underlined in\nthe book) that one of you should go home and the other remain\nwith me.' After a space of time, and much prayer, the answer\ncame : ' Annie to remain here to wait upon me, and Mary to go\nhome for holidays, or to go with Maggie and Dan.' \"\nIn the last paragraph I am quoting the memorandum-book, and\nI must explain that ' Mary ' means Miss Mary Davies (Gorseinon),\n' Maggie ' Miss Maggie Davies (Maesteg), and ' Dan ' Mr. Dan\nRoberts.\nOn Thursday morning the book contained the instruction (to\nMiss Annie Davies) :\n\" There is no person except yourself to see me for the next\nseven days\u2014not even my father and mother. I am not ill. Tell\nMary to inform Dan that he need not trouble, for it is the Lord's\nwill.\"\nI may here add from my personal knowledge that Mr. Dan\nRoberts received that message and acted upon it, although he took\nthe first opportunity available on Thursday after the silence had\nbeen broken to see his brother.\n\"Tell him (continued the note) not to come, for he cannot see\nme. I cannot see Mary or Maggie.\"\nFIRST DAY.\nContinuing to quote from the book, Mr. Evan Roberts read :\n\"On the Tuesday, at 4.22 p.m., I asked the Lord for a message\nand received the answer, 'Isaiah liv. 10.'

On another page of the book Mr. Evan Roberts\nhad written\u2014\"Let my conversation be such as could be printed\nand read by the public without raising a blush upon my cheek.\nLive a practical life\u2014a life of faith, so that if I leave Wales\nwithout a penny in my pocket I shall be satisfied.\"\neverting to the conversation with regard to the first day's silence,\n\fLJ.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 117\nMr. Roberts said :\u2014\" On the margin of a newspaper which was\ntear-stained I wrote to say that my tongue was tied, and that I\nshould not speak. When I was left alone the spirit said, 'Now,\nwatch, and don't utter a word.' I was afraid, but found out on\nretiring to my room that it was not want of power to speak on\nmy part that prevented me speaking, so that it was evident that\nit was intended to be a lesson to me in obedience.\"\nThen, coming back to the diary, I noticed a memo, to this\nsffect:\u2014\"Third lesson. Speak, Lord, in such a way that I may\ndifferentiate Thy voice from the cunning of the Evil One.\"\nI then asked him what this meant, and he said that it was a\nthought which he had written down after meditating upon the\nbare possibility of listening to the voice of the Evil One instead\nof that of God.\nFOURTH DAY.\nA Sunday thought, which I must note in passing, was this :\n\"6.30 a.m. Wait not until thou goest unto Heaven before\nbeginning to praise the Blood. To praise the Blood in Heaven\ncannot bring any one soul to accept it.

I am going to be what God wants me to be.\" Mr. Evan\nRoberts said, \"Yes.\"\nFIFTH DAY.\nOn the fifth day was this note, which clearly indicates the burden\nwhich the silence entailed upon the evangelist :\u2014\" Too tired to\nwrite.\" Later on were these notes :\n\" I have been very near to God this afternoon\u2014so near as to make\nme sweat.\"\n\"I must take great care, first, to do all that God says\u2014com\nmands\u2014and that only.

He prayed silently in the pulpit again,\nand after he finished some one in the congregation shouted, \" Will\nyou kindly say, Mr. Roberts, in what part of the building the man\nis 1 That will facilitate matters.\" Roberts prayed again, and said\nafterwards that the man was not in the middle nor the sides of the\nchapel. Now it was clear that he must have been on the gallery.\nBefore a test was made on the gallery, a minister asked the Rev.\nJ. W. to test in English as well as Welsh because that there were\nsome there who could not understand Welsh. E. Roberts interrupted\nat once and said, \" No, there is not a word of English to be now,\nthe man in question is a Welshman.\" The gallery was tested and\nsome were sitting in the two wings, but not one of them would\nyield. Roberts prayed again and said that the man was not in\neither of the wings, hence he could not be anywhere but on the\nportion of the gallery the further end of the chapel. This again\nwas tested and all stood on their feet. He prayed again and said,\n\"The man must be there, for I am drawn to that direction every\ntime I pray.\" Another test was made by asking the people to raise\ntheir right hands. All did this, and the minister who was going\nround that part of the gallery said, \"I cannot see one here with\nhis hand down.\" The revivalist prayed once more, and at the end\nsaid, \" The man has decided now, and he is by the door on the\nleft.\" In a few seconds a man confessed that he had deceived the\naudience each time, and that it had now become too hard for him,\nand that he was giving himself up.\nAfter this, Roberts said to me and the Rev. J. W., \"You can go\nhome if you wish, but I cannot. The work is not finished.\" In\na few minutes an Englishman came in from behind the pulpit\nRoberts was engaged in silent prayer at the time. This man gave\nhimself up and Roberts said, \"I can go home now, the work is\nled.\" This Englishman related his experience afterwards in the\nof the audience, and said that he was going towards\n\fLi] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 121\nToxteth that night, which is a long distance from and in an\nopposite direction, when on his way he felt some irresistible\ninfluence drawing him towards . Although he knew that all\nwould be carried on in Welsh there, and consequently that he would\nnot be able to understand a word, he found himself in the chapel\nsomehow and was captivated entirely by the singing. He struggled\nwith his feelings and went out to the nearest public house, called for\na pint of ale, made three attempts to drink it, but failed each time.\nHe felt his arm as if it had been paralysed each time he tried.\n(7)\nAccounts by \"Awstin.\"\nI.\nJune 26th, 1905.\nAt Chapel, Penydarren, Mr. Evan Roberts declared that,\nif he was not mistaken, everybody present in that meeting was\ngoing to \" come to Christ \" that day. I, myself, understood that to\nmean during that service, and I was somewhat curious as to whether\nthe prediction would be fulfilled.\nPresently, a young man in the gallery pointing to some one sitting\nin the body of the chapel, urged him to \"come now,\" and added,\n\" I know you have been blaspheming the name of Jesus Christ\nbefore now, but come now, William,\" and he began to pray for the\nsalvation of the man (said by some to be a relative). A young\nwoman in the gallery also prayed for the same man and also\nappealed to him, while she wept bitterly. Some of the \" workers \"\ntalked to the man referred to, and presently one of them said the\nman \"wanted more light.\" \"What light does he want?\" asked\nEvan Roberts. There was no answer for a while, until one of the\n\" workers \" said \" He does not see his way clear.\" Evan Roberta's\nanswer was, \"Pray for him,\" and the meeting proceeded.\nThen a young woman stood up in the gallery and said, \"I cannot\nsee my way clear to come to-day\"\u2014a voluntary public statement\nof a kind I had never previously heard made, by a woman, at any\nrate. Prayers were offered and the meeting proceeded again until\nE. R. declared that there was some obstacle in the meeting which\nneeded removal. He said he did not know what it was. Then he\nprayed, and agonised, the only words I could hear him utter (and\nI sat immediately facing the pulpit, in the \"big pew\") were (in\nWelsh) \"0 Lord, remove it.\" Suddenly, he stopped and said the\n\f122 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\ntnat\nI saw\nbut 1\nH\nobstacle had been removed, but that he did not know what it was.\nSome one present must know, and he hoped that person would say.\nThere was no answer, and the meeting was brought to a close\nrather abruptly.\nRev. T. S asked me if I knew what the declaration meant.\nI said I did not, but would ask Roberts. At tea I asked him, and\nhe said he did not know, but that it would yet be revealed\u2014to\nsome one.\nThat night 1 and Mr. S. and Dr. M. (London Pastors' College)\nwent to another chapel to hear Evan Roberts.\nWhen I met Mr. S. two days later he told me that he had had\nthe sequel to the mysterious declaration as to the removal of the\nobstacle at the meeting. The pastor of that chapel (Mr. O.)\nhad told him that on the night of the declaration a service was\nheld at (although Roberts was at the other chapel), and\nthat at the \"infidel\" of the afternoon service had got up to\nsay that the \" obstacle \" removed during Evan Roberta's agonising\nprayer was the doubt in his (the infidel-atheist's) mind ; that he\nwas a strong-willed man, and positively determined not to publicly\nadmit it when Roberts asked the person who knew to say ; that he\nhad gone home at the close of the afternoon meeting, but could\nget no peace of mind until he now came to declare his conversion\nand to explain what had taken place in the afternoon.\nThe young woman who could not see her way clear in the after\nnoon also came to the \u2022 meeting that night, and thus seemingly\nfulfilled E. R.'s prediction, for all others in the afternoon had stood\nup to declare themselves followers of Christ when the \" tests \" were\nput.\nII.\nTravelling alone in first class carriage, and having nothing to do,\nI began cogitating as to what I would say that day if I were Evan\nRoberts. I wrote two pages on my note-book\u2014making special\nreference to the (then) coming Christmas, and using in one phrase\nthe words, \"Y Crist\" (The Christ). I had never heard E. R. use\nthat description of the Saviour, and do not know why I used it.\nI saw E. R. on his arrival at Treherbert\u2014in presence of others\u2014\nhad no conversation at all with him as to what I had written\ny note-book. He went to have some tea, and I went to the\n:ng. He followed, later on, and to my astonishment began his\nwith the same words as I had written in my book, including\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 123\nAfter writing two pages I had stopped, remarking to myself,\n\"What a ridiculous thing to write, for I am not Evan Roberts.\"\nN'ow, however, E. R. went on further than I had written, and when\nwe met, later on, at the house of Mr. E. D., I showed E. R.\nthe notes. He said, \"Very good.\" I asked what they were. He\nttid, \" Notes of my address to-day.\" I asked him if he knew when\nI wrote them. He said, \" No.\" I told him they were written about\nan hour and a half before he delivered them, and showed him, on\nsubsequent pages of the same note-book, my shorthand notes of the\nactual address.\n(8)\nFrom the Rev. W. M. M., of Maesteg, S. Wales.\nMay 31s\/, 1905.\n(1) The (to me) most remarkable part of the phenomenon called\nthe '\u2022 Religious Revival \" was the ecstatic utterance of illiterate young\nmen and young women. In St. Mary the Virgin's Church, Garth,\nbetween '20 and 30 young people took part in extempore prayer\nregularly at each service (or after-service) for about six weeks.\nPrevious to the Revival not one of these had ever attempted to\nengage in public extempore prayer, and for the last two months\nthey have all \"relapsed\" into their former state of silence and\ncalmness of mind. Their utterances consisted for the most part of\nBible and Prayer Book expressions, so arranged and fitted together\nas to form a coherent and beautifully worded prayer.\nDuring the short period indicated above I heard dozens of\nplayers that for piquancy of expression, richness of cadence, and\nfervency of utterance would have done credit to a St. Chrysostom.\nAnd this from the mouths of young folk whose knowledge would\nhardly be level with the present-day requirements of the fourth\nstandard !\nI asked more than one where or in what manner he had had his\nprayer. The answer I invariably got was : \" I didn't have it any\nwhere, sir; it came to me at the time, and I couldn't help praying.\"\nAll the young people who took part in these services are members\nof our Sunday school, and they are nearly all communicants. In\nage they ranged from fifteen to twenty-five.\n(2) A remarkable change took place in the countenances of these\nyoung people when under the influence of the spiritual spell. T\nobserved that they became very pale, and their eyes wore a far-away\n\f124 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nlistless look. One young man told me that for some days after a\ncertain service in which he had prayed, he saw people move like\nghosts in the street, and thought there was a thick mist.\n(3) We had one remarkable conversion. C. R. G., an irregular\nmember of my congregation, and an unbeliever in the divinity\nof our Lord, had a vision during a revival service. He saw\na lit candle emerge from the font of St. Mary's Church, and\nthe figure of an angel shielding it with his wing from the draught\nthat came from the open door. The flame, he said, was very small,\nand the least breath of air would have extinguished it, but for the\nprotection of the angel wing. Before the end of the service the\nyoung man got up and publicly renounced his heresy. On Christmas\nDay he was baptised by immersion in the brook Cerdin.\n(4) A young man by the name of B. prayed very fervently at\none of our Sunday evening revival services for the salvation of\nhis father. Early on the morrow he received a telegram to say\nthat his father had died very suddenly on Sunday evening. It\ntranspired that his father passed away just at the time that he\nwas praying, or shortly after.\nYoung B. explained to me that he was moved by an irresistible\nimpulse to engage in prayer on behalf of his father, although as\nfar as he knew there was no particular reason for it. His father,\nup to the hour of his death, was apparently in perfect health. The\nyoung man had never before prayed extempore, and I don't know\nthat he has since. My people came to believe, as they still do, that\nthe prayer was inspired. It certainly was a remarkable one.\nC. R. G.'s own account of the incident described by Mr. M.\nis as follows:\nJune 20th, 1905.\nI certify that on Sunday evening the 18th of December, 1904, I\ndid see a vision of an angel by the font of Garth Church, which\nwas sheltering a small candle which seemed to be standing out of\nnothing, coming up out of the water in the font. There was a draught\ncoming in from the door, but the angel with his wings stopped the\ncandle from douting. It was at the time Mr. M. was speaking\nof Christ. I did not believe in Christ before that He was our God\nand my Saviour. I had always denied Him, but never again, for I\nbelieved then, and I was baptised in the river Cerdin on Christmas\nday.\nI am 26 years of age. An Englishman.\ni am zo y\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 125\nIn regard to the last incident described by Mr. M., Mr. B.\nwrites:\nMAESTEG, 5th July, 1905.\nIn reply to your inquiry, I beg to state that my father died on\nMonday, December 19, 1904, about 11.30 a.m. The enclosed wire\nwill sufficiently prove this, I think. He was apparently in perfect\nhealth up to within about two hours of his death. He was certainly\nquite well when I had last heard from home ; as also he was on\nthe Sunday evening which I am about to mention. On Sunday\nevening, December 18, I attended a revival service at St. Mary's\nChurch, Garth. It was a wonderful service, and the Holy Spirit\nwas present. Towards the close of the service, about 9 o'clock, or\nft little after, I felt an irresistible impulse to pray for my father,\nwhich I did. I distinctly saw his face, and heard him asking me to\npray for him. I had never engaged in public prayer in my life\nbefore, and I regret to say I have not felt strong enough in my\nspirit to do so since. But I found no difficulty in praying that\nevening.\nI was told at home after my father's death that a very strange\nthing had happened there on the Sunday evening in question. The\nchildren at home usually said their prayers in the bed-room, but\nat my father's request that evening they said their prayers down\nstairs in the drawing-room. Father and mother knelt with them\nand listened to their prayers. When the children had finished my\nfather still knelt, and kept on kneeling for a long time, till my\nmother thought there was something the matter with him, so she\nwent on and touched him on the shoulder. He said, \"I am all\nright, I was only thinking of the boy\"\u2014meaning myself. It is extra\nordinary to think that at that very time, as near as we can judge,\nI was also praying for him in church.\nThere is no mistake about it, I distinctly saw my father in the\nservice. He knelt alongside of me and looked at me with a pitiful\nface and said, \" My dear boy, pray for me.\" This is the sincere\ntruth. I had never taken religion very seriously before, but I do\nnow. If you want to know more, will you be so good as to ask\nthe Rev. Mr. M.\nThe telegram enclosed in Mr. B.'s letter is dated December\n19th, 1904, handed in at 11.10 a.m., received at 11.26 a.m.,\nand says, \" Come home immediately ; dad dying.\"\nIn reply to my inquiries, the Registrar of the district\n\f126 Rev.

D., of T :\nJune 21s\/, 1905.\nI have always taken great interest in reading, and always the best\nbooks I could get hold of. I was a member of Church,\nT (Independent or Congregational Church), for years, also a\nSunday School teacher, also a member of their string band. But I\nleft the church 4^ years ago, because I could not agree with them\nin certain dogmas. Then I took more to reading than ever. I have\nread all the R.P.A. reprints as published, and I thought they were\ngood, because they satisfied my spirit more than anything else I\nknew of. The Idea of God and the Spirit World were put aside,\nand read as much as I could on the subject of Psychic Phenomena.\n1 read the lessons of the American school of science, and a course\nfrom the Psychic Research Society and the New Thought. I read\nProf. VV. James and Stout's books on Psychology ; also books on\nEthics by Mackenzie and Newman Smith. I read books on Free-\nthought, Ingersoll, \"Saladin,\" Foote, and Cohen, and some of J. S.\nMil1's books, also Paine, etc. I also attended lectures on Free-\nthought. It all led me to Agnosticism and Abstractive Idealism.\nI may here tell you that I kept myself from all immoral actions. I\nalways tried to think the best and live the noblest. I and a few\nfriends started an Ethical Society, and, being the secretary, took\ngreat interest in it, and spent a year splendid together. Then the\nRevival started here at T , so we discontinued the meetings\nof the Ethical Society ; but I suggested to my friends that we should\ncontinue with our meetings, and if any good was to become of this\nRevival that we should take the advantage of it. But they refused,\nso I attended two revival meetings with much interest, and was\nastonished at the conversions of some of the most reckless men\nand women I knew of. Questions arose several times to my mind,\nsuch as, How was it to be accounted that moral consciousness were\ncentrified into the conscience of these people 1 Although I knew\nthrough reading Professor W. James's book, Varieties of Religion*\nExperience, that the centrif'ying of moral ideas produced great fits\nof hysteria, etc. ; but I was surprised upon seeing and hearing the\ntestimonies of many dozens of people. Some young men of noble\n\ft.t.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 127\ncharacter experienced great joy, because they could see that their\nprayers were answered. They prayed that God should save some\nparticular friend or person, and these friends were coming from public-\nhouses, and giving themselves up to Christ and His service, bursting\ninto tears for their sins. I knew of some coming miles away in\nanswer to prayers on their behalf. I knew about Thought-transference,\nand have seen it effective several times ; but I could not make out\nwhy these men and women whom I have seen were morally changed\ninstantaneous, and they live better now than ever.\nI attributed many of the conversions to be effected through the\npsychology of emotions, imitative instinct, imaginations, etc. ; also\nthrough ideational and conceptual process. In some of the meetings\nmany showed great agony in their bodies, which was unexplainable\nto me. There were dozens praying the same time at some meetings,\nand four to six several times I witnessed praying. Several of these\nwere tried to \"hush up,\" but it was of no use at all, because many\nof them lost all consciousness.\nIn all meetings which I attended up to the end of February I\nwas quite positive to all these various influences, because I practised\n\"auto-suggestion,\" and I knew it to keep me without being affected\nat all.\nI noticed that in many of the meetings I attended there was great\nlack of enthusiasm, sometimes very quiet ; others noticed it. Among\nthem the Rev. J. G. J. was one who expressed this belief on the\n20th of November, 1904. I was in this meeting from 7.30 to\n10 o'clock, when he made this statement: \"I don't know what\nis the reason that this meeting and others I have noticed are so\nhard. The Spirit of God does not seem to work here to-night yet,\nbut I know that after the sceptics and lookers-cm have gone home it\nis then that the spirit works among us.\" So, I said to myself, I shall\nsee if this is correct to-night and what it is like. I went home\nand had supper. Then I went back again to the lobby or porch\nof the chapel, and I determined that I should not go in to disturb\nanything. I opened the door quietly and peeped in. I never\nwitnessed such a scene or sensation. The great fervour or enthusiasm,\nthe agony, the joy, men and women jumping in their seats, some\npraying, thanking God for answering their prayers; others praying\nunto God that they should experience this mighty power in their\nsouls, others testifying that they had received the Holy Spirit, and\none person said, \"Don't try to understand this, but throw yourself\ninto it. It surpasseth all understanding.\" But I said to myself, I\n\f128 Rpv. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nwant to understand something about it first, then I will believe in\nit. About 12.30 this night a schoolmaster, a splendid character and\nscholar, rose up and proclaimed that he had felt something that\nnight which he never experienced before in his life. On seeing this,\na friend of mine, T. W., who was sitting with his wife and\nanother friend on the gallery, said he did not believe much in the\nRevival. He wanted to know something about it, so he thought\nhe would go and ask a few questions to this schoolmaster, what he had\nto say about it. He caught in his hat and began walking down the\nstaircase, when he was instantaneously knocked (as it were) unconscious.\nHe ran down the stair, and he then jumped five of the steps to the\nfloor (you will remember that I was in the porch all this time), so\nI was the first that he saw. He looked like a madman, with his\neyes penetrating through me as it were. He ran to me and caught\nhold in my hand, and shouted out, \" Here is reality to-night. Here\nis reality to-night. There is no philosophy in the universe that will\nexplain this, and I am going in here to say what I have felt here\nto-night, and I want you to be saved, my friend.\" Then he ran\ninto the chapel, and on by the pulpit. He jumped on top of a\nseat, and he threw his hat with all his might up towards the ceiling\nof the church, and with a loud voice he declared that his whole\nlife had been full of hypocrisy and fraud, and shouted for God\nand men to forgive him. Then he came out again and told me that\nI ought to get his experience, and that I should pray for it. It\ncould not be explained. It is above all understanding, he said. He\nremained partly unconscious for a fortnight. The house and every\nwhere seemed brighter, and he saw a vision of a place beautifully\nwhite, and a voice came to him that God would be his \u00bbrefuge and\nstrength. There is a great difference in him now ; he is more\npeaceful than ever and joyous and enthusiastic, and ready to do\nservice to all.\nHe was moved by the Spirit twice after this fortnight to uncon\nsciousness. How he escaped from injury while jumping and passing\nacross seats was marvellous. He prayed on these occasions with\nsuch earnestness and zeal as I never heard before ; and he received\nsuch physical strength that he thought he could move away a\ntremendous weight.\nI have asked him several times if he desired anything of the kind\nof experience he had had, and he said, \"No, never. I could not\nthink of it ; but I am much happier now.\"\nOn this great night, however, I was quite cool and unmoved.

The Spiritual world was not a reality to me, and\nan answer to prayer I knew nothing of it. I knew of the effect\nof auto-suggestion upon myself, and I knew what effect a good and\nhealthy suggestion had on others. I wanted an evidence to prove\nthat the Spiritual world was a reality. They insisted that I should\nbelieve in Christ first, then I should do what he told us to do (that\nis, to pray unto God through Him, and I should find out for myself\nthe result). After a few months' time I decided that I should\nobtain this experience if it was possible. So, on the 25th of Feb.,\nI determined that I would take Christ my ideal in life. I went to\nthe meeting on that night. It was overcrowded. I never was in such\na meeting. The prayers in this congregation had an inspiring effect\nupon me, which caused a thrill through my body, causing great\npain. I cried bitterly ; why, I don't know.\nAt the end of the meeting, about 11 o'clock, I went home. I\ncould not sleep all night. Sunday I felt great pain, and Monday as\nwell, and I lost all appetite for food. Monday night I went along\nto a meeting about seven miles away with some friends. I addressed\nthe meeting and appealed unto those present to accept Christ as\na moral ideal; and, about 11.30 p.m., a person came into the chapel\nwith some effect of intoxicants upon him. He came to my side and\nknelt down, and said a few words very effectively. \"I have come\nhere to-night,\" he said. \" I cannot tell you why I was forced to\ncome. I went out to-day for a walk, and have been drinking all\nthrough the afternoon, and to-night I went home about 7.30 p.m.\nThere was nobody there waiting me, so I undressed and went to\nbed, but I could not sleep at all. I used to sleep when I got drunk,\nbut I had to dress again and come out here\" (his wife was in the\nmeeting praying that he should come there), and he said that he\nwas going to be a Christian. I was glad to see him. After coming\nhome I felt very painful. Tuesday and in the evening I went to\na prayer meeting. I did enjoy myself, but there was great agony\nthrough my body. Why, I know not. But it remained through\nthe week, up to Saturday, March 4th, 1905. I went to this prayer\nmeeting, and I prayed unto God to forgive my sins and reveal unto\nme Himself. I don't remember the prayer. I lost all my conscious\nness that night. Some friends had put me to sit down on a seat\n(I suppose). It is there that I regained consciousness, and as I\n\f130 Rev. A. T. Fryer.

Is it that my emotion has been intensified more than\never before 1 If that is the fact, I will deny it all again. I must\nhave something more real than this. I want to know the fact if the\nspiritual world is a reality or not.\nAnd while I was in this attitude of mind (it came to my mind thai\nI prayed unto God to reveal something to me and to my friends, and I\nremembered that I named two of them in my prayer) a voice told me\nthat A. B., one of those whom you are praying for, is in the\nmeeting to-night by the door. And I said, \"No, he is not here.\nHe is in the Workmen's Club or Bute Arms. It is there that I\nshould look for him whatever.\" Then the voice told me the second\ntime exactly the same words, and I answered him back, saying,\n\" I shall see now if this is true.\"\nI stood up and I saw his brother a few seats before me. I went\non and asked him if his brother was in the meeting, and he said,\n\"Yes; he has been in the meeting to-night sitting by the door,\nand has just gone out now.\"\nI was astonished when I found it true.

Then it became quite light again, and all\nof a sudden her four little children, who had been buried, came down\nand appeared before her, exactly as they were on earth, except that\nthey were all in white, and simultaneously with this she heard a\ncrowd singing \"O Paradise,\" etc., and she was forced gently but\nirresistibly out of the room into the back-yard from which she\ncould see church, and at that moment there were a dozen men\nwending their way up the hill to the church, and she exclaimed,\n\"Why should 1 object to Jim going to the meetings when others\nare going ' \" and she fell down and prayed. She saw the children\nagain and Jesus Christ behind them, and the children said, \"Crown\nHim, Mam,\" and they disappeared. She finished the washing,\ncleaned up the place, and was dressed up ready for the evening\nservice, with tea ready when he came home at 5.30, and she told\nhim all. Since then she has been quite a different woman and is\npresent in all the services.\nThat is exactly what she told me. I have not seen her husband\nsince your letter came.

My husbaud being lieutenant\nfor four years was carrying on the meetings, and as there were\nmany fresh converts he was trying to keep them out of temptations\nduring the holidays. I felt my husband was doing too much work\nor, as the saying is, pushing his nose too much in the clergy's\nwork, and I wanted him to stay at home and help me in the house,\nbut he would not, and I told him that if he had pleasure in church\nthat he should have none at home. So I went to wash, but it was\nvery slow, I could not get on as usual. But about half-past three\nI began to feel very queer, the room went all dark and it seemed\nas if the room was full, or like a swarm of bees around me. I went\nout to the back yard and I saw about a dozen men going into\nchurch, so I said to myself, \" Why should I be against my husband\ndoing good when others are going to do good'!\" and turning into\nthe house again the kitchen was beautiful and light as if the sun\nwas shining there. I went back to the wash tub and there before\nme appeared the four children, and one of them spoke in English\nto me saying, \"Mam, come,\" and then they disappeared. I could\nhear the singing of the hymn \"O Paradise\" until it died away in\nthe distance.\n(10) As natural as you see Him on a picture.\n\fLL] Psyclwlogical Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 133\nThe following are questions I sent to Mr. M. with his\nanswers appended :\n(1) Was Mr. M. praying for his wife when in church?\n(2) What was going on in church just at the moment when the\nvision - occurred '.\n(3) Is it probable that people were singing the hymns heard, at\nthe time they were heard ?\n(4) Had Mr. M. alluded to the departed children (in conversation\nwith his wife) on the day of the vision, or the day before ?\nWere they in his mind that day 1\n(5) Will Mr. M. give his own written statement of what his\nwife told him on his return from afternoon service?\n(6) It is important to know what Mr. M. was thinking about\nat the time of the visions.\nANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.\n(1) Yes.\n(2) I was in church half-an-hour before anybody came, and I\nprayed while walking around the church for my wife, but not a\nthought of the children came into my mind, as far as I am aware.\nI was tilled with the Spirit of God.\n(3) No, there was no singing at all about that time.\n(4) Not any whatever.\n(5) She wanted to know what was the matter with me, as I\nwas looking sad and confused.

There were many by them, but they were the only ones,\nthat heard it.\nE. B., on Wednesday previous, heard about four o'clock what\nappeared to him to be a thunder clap, followed by lovely singing in\nthe air.\nMrs. R., on Saturday evening, the 14th January, saw a ball of\nfire descending on the hill in front of her house, and, after rolling\nsome distance, disappeared.\nE. E., on Saturday evening, between seven and eight, while\nreturning home from his work, heard some strange music, similar\nto the vibration caused by telegraph wires, only much louder,\non an eminence, the hill being far from any trees and wires of any\nkind, and it was more or less a still evening.\nJ. P. heard some lovely singing on the road, about half a\nmile from his home, on Saturday evening, three weeks ago, which\nfrightened him very much.\n(12)\nFrom the Rev. J. N. E., Vicar of .\nMay 30th, 1905.\n... I observed much latent earnestness and deep religious feelings\npervading a goodly number of the parishioners about October, 1904.\nIt manifested itself in greater earnestness at the services of the\nchurch, and particularly in greater attendance and interest at a\nBible class which I had just started. This feeling, which could be\nmanifestly felt, I also shared ; it did not appear to me to be com\nmunicated by means of any outside agency.\nIt is important to note that this latent feeling (or whatever it\nmay be called) was in existence before any publicity was given to\n\fIi] Psyckoloyicul Aspects of t\/te Welsh Revival. 135\nthe Revival in the public press, and before I even heard of its exist\nence elsewhere.\nShortly afterwards, about the beginning of November, I heard\nthat the subdued spirit to which I have referred had actually broken\nout into prayer aiid praise in a small Methodist chapel in the parish.\nBelieving that the root cause was similar to that which I myself\nexperienced, I spoke to some of the most prominent connected with\nit, and made arrangements that the whole parish should unite in\nthe matter. The suggestion was gladly embraced, and the whole\nof the parishioners practically assembled in the parish church, when\na most remarkable service was held, characterised by the deepest\nearnestness . and a reality which could be felt.\nThat went on for months, and is being still continued ; but on\nthat aspect it is not my purpose to dwell at present. I will en\ndeavour to give some instances such as you require.\n(1) A remarkable ease and fluency in prayer and public dis\ncourses, which was common to all. I felt this myself to a remarkable\ndegree. Whereas previously I often felt it a burden to speak, my\nmind seemed to expand, and a new vista of truths would unfold\nitself, and I could give expression to my thoughts with the greatest\nease, and also pleasure. Also, the receptiveness of the hearers was\nsuch as I never before experienced. I have addressed these meet\nings on an average two or three times a week for the last six\nmonths.\n(2) Some almost illiterate persons have broken out in prayer in\nsuch a way as to cause great surprise. I can mention two in par\nticular. One, a young girl, 18 years of age. She can scarcely read,\nand has never had any opportunity for culture\u2014brought up amidst\nsqualid surroundings, her father being a very careless and indifferent\nman ; her mother died when she was a child.\nThis young girl gives expression to the most refined and literary\nsentiments, couched in admirable phraseology. Her form of language\nis partly Biblical and partly the natural mode of conversation. She\nrefers constantly to her mother, though she has been dead about 15-\nyears. I have been much struck by the girl's changed appearance\nduring these months. My wife has also marked it.1 The father is\nnow a changed man, and attends every service in church.\nThe other case is a labouring man about 40, who had never taken\n1 Her erpreasion has become much more gentle. Her face, previously coarse.\nbaa now quite a refined appearance. As one expressed it to me, \" She has a.\nMadonna-like fuce.\" This feature is, I think, remarkable.\n\f13G Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\npart publicly before this time. He also is extraordinarily eloquent\nand choice in diction. The form of his language is largely drawn\nfrom hymnology.\n(3) A few days before Christmas, 1904, I was riding to see some\nparishioners in parish. They lived about three miles up the\nhillside. As I was gradually ascending I fancied I heard voices\nsinging. I took little notice for the moment, believing it was pure\nfancy. Gradually the voices seemed to increase in volume, until at\nlast they became quite overpowering. I was trying to imagine it\ncould be nothing outside myself, as it were, but the wonderful\nharmony seemed to be borne on me entirely from the outside, and\nwas as real to my senses as anything I have ever heard.\nI could distinguish the words distinctly. They were :\n\" Pwy all beidio cofio am dano,\nPwy all beidio canu ei glod,\nDyma gariad na'd a'n angho,\nTra bydd uefoedd wen yn bod.\"\nThe moment the refrain would come to an end it would be re\nstarted, the volume becoming greater and greater. To me it was\nan exquisite sensation. When about arriving at my destination the\nvoices suddenly ceased. I have had no trace of the recurrence of\nsuch a thing, and never had such an experience previously. I am\nnot given to study or dwell upon any such manifestations.\nI sent the following questions to Mr. E., and his answers to\nthem are annexed :\n(1) Can you say why the spirit of the Revival reached L and\nnot other places? There is a marked difference in this respect be\ntween different localities. In some, desperate efforts were made,\nwithout effect, to stir up a Revival.\n(2) Had there been prayer for a Revival at all amongst your people ?\nHave any of them admitted, since it began, that it was what they\nhad hoped for and prayed for ? Perhaps some of the older people\nremembered 1859.\n(3) Is it possible to get some account of the beginnings, in November,\n1904, of the Revival Spirit in the Methodist Chapel in your parish f\nDid it begin there in the same spontaneous fashion as in church 1\nHad none of the Methodists then heard of Roberts or of the Spirit\nin your church ? As you spoke to some of the prominent\nMethodists about this in November, no doubt you can recollect\nwhat they said on this point.\n(4) Has the \"ease and fluency\" remained up to the present time? I\n\fLI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 137\nask this because temporary excitement might have induced the\nuniversal ease.\n(5) Were persons affected by fear or love ? This applies to the pos\nsibility of fear of hell as a motive to \"conversion.\" The\ndoctrinal element is of importance. So far as I can trace, fear is\nnot prominent.\n(6) In the case of the girl affected, does her reference to her mother\nmean that she is under the impression of being in contact with her now,\nor is it simple recollection ? She was three years of age when her\nmother died. What sort of a person was the mother? Do you\nsuspect hereditary influence 1\n(7) Has her ordinary conversational language changed, or is the change\nconfined to prayer and praise ?\n(8) Similar questions apply to the man of 40. Does he consider\nhimself helped by some outside agency ?\n(9) Singing. Has any one in the parish heard similar singing ? Can\nyou give me the translation of the words heard ?\n(10) I suppose that it is improbable that the singing came from\nany house passed on the way 1\n(11) Did the horse you were riding behave as if at all conscious of hear\ning any singing ? This is an important detail.\n(12) Have you ever in life heard this particular verse sung as you\nheard it during the ride? Was it unconscious memory?\n(13) Have you ever seen a canwyll gorph, or \"ghost,\" or had any\nremarkably fulfilled dream?\n(14) Have you any recollection of any ancestor or other relative who\nsaw or heard anything abnormal ?\n(15) Has any parishioner seen a light, or a vision, or heard\nvoices !\nAnswers to Questions re Revival.\n(1) The difference between different localities has also greatly\nstruck me, and I have wondered much at the cause. The only\nexplanation that I can offer as regards L is, that this\nneighbourhood has for many years been blessed with a good pro\nportion of earnest and religiously-minded men and women. So that\nwhen a spirit of Revival was begotten the conditions were favour\nable for its nurture and development.\n(In a neighbouring parish, e.g., every effort was made to secure\na revival, without effect.)\nFrom observation and experience, I am convinced that given\nfavourable conditions in any parish, i.e., a few devout people, also\n\f138 Rev.

[PART\none or two who are in true sympathy with a religious revival,\nwho can understand it on its mental and spiritual sides, and are\nable to communicate their spirit to others\u2014the movement would\novercome every obstacle, and the bulk of the population would be\naffected by it.\n(2) No, not in a definite sense. One man testified recently that\nhe had felt for some years that there was something lacking in the\nChristian church. He could not say or feel what it was, but that\nhe daily prayed fiod to supply it, whatever it was. This man is\none of the best churchmen in the parish ; he is thoroughly sound\nand sane, and above the average in intelligence. When this move\nment was felt, he was convinced that his prayers were answered.\nI know of no similar case here.\nSome of the people remember slightly the 1859 Revival, but\nstrange to say, that did not affect this neighbourhood at all, as\nfar as I can learn, and I have made careful inquiries.\n(3) In the Methodist Chapel it broke out through the instru\nmentality of one young man, one of the best I have ever known.\nHe had been at a service with Roberts (before the latter broke\nout). What I could gather from the Methodists was that this\nyoung man was the means of touching the hearts of those present.\n(I shall try and get him to communicate with you.)\n(4) Yes. One of the best and most impressive meetings we\nhave had was last Monday evening.\n(5) Love decidedly. (The doctrines chiefly involved are the whole\ncycle of the Redeemer's life's work, culminating in the atonement.\nAlso the bearing of the whole upon practical life and duty.)\n(6) My impression is that she seems to feel her mother's unseen\ninfluence, certainly seeing and perhaps helping her in her difficulties.\nThe mother was, I learn, a pious woman ; the girl cannot have\nthe faintest recollection of her.\nI cannot say about hereditary influence\u2014(there is none on the\nfather's side).\n(7) No.\n(8) No. He is moved by an inward influence.\n(9) No.\n\"Who cannot but bear Him in remembrance,\nWho cannot but sing His praise ;\nLove such as His will not be forgotten,\nAs long as holy heaven exists.\"\nIt did not proceed from any house.

[I was] brought up in a religious family and with religion in\nthe parish church, where my father was parish clerk and church\nwarden the greater part of his life. I was confirmed between 14\nand 15 years of age, and from that time forward I have been accus\ntomed to speak and to perform every public duty, and to rejoice\nin every religious service.\nIn the month of November missioners in connection with the\nRevival came to the neighbourhood, and I went to the meetings,\nand by seeing and hearing the effects on other people, I understood\nthat Jesus of Nazareth was walking through our country, but I\nwas unable to feel Him nor see Him to myself, and that was my\nanxiety for many days, lest Jesus of Nazareth should pass by, and\nI without receiving a renewing view of Him. But on the 12th\nDecember, on a Monday night, I had this heavenly vision which\nthe tongue of man cannot relate or describe appropriately, nor the\nunspeakable blessings which I received to myself, which things I\nhid not without declaring them, and I cannot less than give them\nto you in writing.\nAnd this is the vision. On the night stated, I was travelling by\nmyself on the high road on a work night which was very dark,\nbut in the darkness overhead I beheld a faint light playing over\nmy bead and approaching the earth, and as it came nearer it increased\nand strengthened ; and lest I was being deceived by my own ej'es,\nI determined to close them, but 1 was seeing it (the light) in the\nsame way. Then I opened my eyes to behold the vision, and then\nit came downwards and stood before me, about the size of a man's\nbody, and in the bright and glorious light I beheld there the face\nof a man, and by looking for the body in the light a shining white\nrobe was covering it to its feet and it was not touching the earth,\n\f140 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nand behind its arms there were wings appearing, and I was seeing\nevery feather in the wings, but they were not natural or material\nfeathers, but the whole was heavenly beyond description. And then\nthe palms of the hands were appearing, and on each hand there\nwere brown spots as they appeared at first. But after I had noticed\nmore minutely, I beheld that they were the marks of the nails, and\nthen I recognised Him as Jesus, and I went forward shouting, \"O\nmy blessed Jesus\" and then He ascended on His wing without\nnoise, moving a little further ahead, and appearing much more\nbright and clear, so that the marks of the nails were so fiery and\nso plain that I can say that they were square nails of the cruellest\ndescription, and by the work of Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus\npulling Him down from the cross, the sores of His dear flesh had\ncome out to the palms of His hands ; and this appearance gave such\npeace to my breast, so that it filled it through with love, so that\nfrom that time forth I love every man without difference.\nAnd in the light of this presence the old ugly world came before\nme in its entirety, so that I saw its mountains, its rocks, its moors,\nits rushes, its thorns, its entangled growths, its stones, and all\nhindrances on my way, so that I was retreating (moving away or\naside), lest its stones should throw me over, lest its thorns and\nits entangled growths should rend me. Which journey I would\nthink every true Christian must go through. And after He had\nled me through this journey in that way, and I beseeching Him\nto come with me, and when He had stayed the third time, behold\nHo ascended up and out of my sight. And then I besought His\nforgiveness if poor and unworthy dust had asked too much to the\nGreat and Holy Being.\nIn answer to my questions Mr. J. wrote :\n... I had neither been night-watching nor had had a dream before\nI saw the vision.\nNone of the family experienced the same thing.\nThe appearance of the world I saw by means of the light was one\nvision\u2014not a light showing the earth around, because I am well\nacquainted with the place\u2014but the surface of the whole world losing\nitself in the distance.\nThere are neither bogs nor rushes nor rocky mountains in that\ndistrict, but good and fruitful land.

J. P., of A , Glamorganshire.\nJune 2nd, 1905.\nThe circumstances leading up to the Revival in P-\nare not quickly or easily described, because there has been a leading\nup for years, but the immediately preceding circumstances are these.\nHearing of what went on in other places, a week's prayer was\ndecided. At the close of the week a distinct change was noticeable\nin the manner of the meeting. All seemed to be labouring under\na suppressed excitement. On the Saturday the minister saw Evan\nRoberts, and casually remarked that he did not \"feel\" anything.\nThe reply he received was that the essential was faith, and not\nfeeling. The minister returned home with this message; and in the\nevening, when going home from the service with my brother and\nanother young man, suggested an open-air meeting. Instantly they\nbegan singing, and were joined by many others. This was about\n9 o'clock. The meeting went on until about 3.30 Sunday morning.\nI made an effort about 10.15 to go home. With difficulty I got\naway, but felt an overpowering impulse to join the group. How\never, I made my way along the road, and commenced climbing the\nhill to my home. This necessitated a slowing down, as it were,\nand when about halfway up the hill I stopped. Along the road I\nheard an inward voice saying, \" Go back, go back ! \" whilst I felt\nquite uneasy. However, I returned to the group, and remained to\nthe end of the meeting. The following day (Sunday) the words of\nthe preacher and others seemed to have a terrible force, and at\nnight I felt bound to do something. I rose from my seat and\nspoke a few words, saying that I felt that I had not been what I\nshould have been. After this I often had the desire to speak or\nsing or pray. I realised that there was a great power on my side,\nand that I must obey that power. With regard to prayer, the\ngeneral trend was in the language of the Bible and hymns, quotations\nbeing much used.\n\f142 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nAs regards my previous manner of life, and also that of my\nparents and grandparents on both sides, it is no exaggeration to\nsay it has been decidedly religious.

However, I did not do it,\nand whenever I wished to pray, the thought of not having done\nthis one thing came to my mind ; and on one occasion I saw in\nmy mind's eye a large white throne, with no one sitting there, as\nfar as I could see. Across the front of this throne was the word\n\" Disobedience,\" in large black letters. I saw this every time I\nattempted to pray, until I had done what I felt I must do. For\nthe past few years I have at various times felt that I should go\nabroad as a missionary, but had not been able to give in to the\n\u2022desire.

We saw twelve at the same time ;\ntwo were very bright, the one of a red, the other of a blue colour.\nThey were inland, the same as before, but from what we could\nobserve they did not confine themselves to marshy ground, although\nat first they seemed to rise from the ground where we knew there\nwere swamps. It was a very dark and foggy night, and my brother,\nmy son Percy, my keeper and I went out about a mile to see if\nwe could get near them. When we had gone about half a mile we\nobserved four or five behind us. We went to the farm adjoining,\nand called their attention to them. Mrs. Picton-Jones and two\nservants watched them for an hour and a half, and had, from their\ndescription, a better view than we had, as we were occasionally in\nhollows. On our way home from Bryntani farm we saw a bright\nlight at Yoke House, which we all thought was a lamp put out\nto direct us home, the night being so dark and our course across\ncountry. The other servants by this time, having come home from\nchurch and chapel, were watching the curious antics of the lights.\nI should mention that we had a lamp with us, but it was darkened,\nexcept when we came to banks or ditches. Those at Yoke House\nsaw the same light, and thought it was our lamp, but were all\nmistaken, as, when we got within about 200 yards of our pond,\nthe light turned into a deep blue colour and disappeared. In front\nof the other pool there are some sheds, and one light that had\nappeared before we started seemed to go in and out, round the\ncorner, on to the cart horse stable, round its gable end, then on\nto the barn, exactly the same as if it were a human being, with\nthe exception of rising to such a height that even 'Tall Agrippa'\ncould not come up to it.

Some\nK\n\f144 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\nfive or six Tears ago, owing to an accident on the Cambrian Railway,\nI had to post from Machynlleth to the neighbourhood of Towyn,\nwhere I was then residing. It would then be about 12 o'clock\np.m. when I came in sight of the low ground and sandy dunes\nbetween Borth and the Dovey, the night being perfectly clear and\nstill and the stars shining, when, to my astonishment, I saw four\nor five lights moving apparently on the sand hills near the farm\nof Ynyslas. I called the post-boy's attention to them, and never\ndid I see a man so paralysed with fright : I thought he would have\nfallen off the box, and the perspiration, as I could see by the\nlight of the lamps, fairly ran down his face. He evidently con\nsidered them of supernatural origin, as he told me an incoherent\nstory of a boat's crew of shipwrecked foreigners having been murdered\nwhen they came ashore there many years ago (upon further inquiry\nI found there was some tradition of the sort). However, there the\nlights were, moving about in a sort of aimless way until, as near\nas I can remember, we reached within a mile or two of Aberdovey.\nThey were white, and about the size and brilliancy of the lamps\ncarried by railway guards and porters. There is yet another\nphenomenon of which no satisfactory explanation has ever yet been\ngiven. On the 24th of September, 1854 (I refer to my game book\nof that year), a friend was shooting with me in Herefordshire. The\nday was perfectly still, the sky cloudless, when sounds like dis\ncharges of heavy artillery came from the west, which, striking against\na range of wooded hills running north and south under which we\nwere shooting, made most wonderfully distinct echoes. These dis\ncharges, or whatever they were, continued for several hours at\nregular intervals of about two minutes. Since then similar sounds\nhave been heard two or three times (judging from the letters to\nthe papers), and principally by persons living in Cardiganshire, but\ntheir origin has never yet, so far as I can see, been discovered.\"\nFrom \"Bye-Gones,\" October, 1877 (p. 292).\n\"Now we have a statement from Towyn that within the last\nfew weeks ' lights of various colours have frequently been seen\nmoving over the estuary of the Dysynni river and out at sea.

I was accompanied by an\nassistant to help with the installation and working of the electrical\napparatus. This apparatus consisted of an electrical collector raised\n20 feet above the ground on a pole and supported on an insulator.\nAttached to this collector was a phosphor-bronze wire about 300\nyards in length and carried on porcelain insulators. This wire con\nstituted the positive electric lead, and in the circuit I placed a\n1See Gotsiping Guide to Wales, p. 90, for similar account of 1694 lights.\n\f146 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nglass v\n*\ngalvanometer and a telephone receiver, which latter is the most\nsensitive indicator of abnormal atmospheric electrical conditions. I\nalso placed a delicate compass between the galvanometer and the\ntelephone receiver where it would instantly respond to the slightest\nelectrical influence; the negative poles of these instruments were\nwell \" earthed.\" On testing this line with a single small dry cell,\nall the instruments responded.\nI spent the greater part of the day of the 14th in investigating\nlocal reports and in surveying the ground where the lights were\nreported to have been seen. I visited the local telephone and\ntelegraph stations, and inquired if the instruments there had been\ninterfered with by atmospheric electricity. In no instance was this\nthe case, although the men in charge told me that in consequence\nof the presence of a large sun spot they had received orders to pay\nspecial attention to the working of the instruments. I then inquired\nif there was a \" Marconi Station \" in the neighbourhood, but I\nlearnt that the nearest one was at Holyhead. It occurred to me\nthat the lights might have been due to a discharge of what is\nknown as \"globular lightning,\" but this form of electrical disturb\nance is usually accompanied by an explosion, and much damage is\ndone in the vicinity. A careful examination of the hillside failed\nto show any signs of this.\nI erected my apparatus on the hillside on the spot where the\nlights were reported to have been seen, and remained by it for\nmany hours of darkness without observing the slightest deflection\nof the instruments or seeing anything abnormal, with the exception\nof two brilliant flashes towards the north. These, I afterwards learnt,\nwere due to an attempt on the part of some newspaper correspon\ndents to photograph the chapel by flashlight.\nWednesday, 15th February. On my behalf Mr. Dilnot wired Mr.\nJones of Dyfiryn to ask for the whereabouts of his wife, who was\nreported to be the originator of these lights. Mrs. Jones unex\npectedly returned to Dyffryn, so I proceeded there and interviewed\nher. This interview was unsatisfactory ; it is obvious to me that\nthe woman is a religious maniac, and that no reliance can be placed\non her statements, which were vague and indefinite. Another long\nnight watch resulted in nothing. I certainly saw several lights\nwhich might have appeared to be abnormal to the overwrought\nimagination, but when resolved by a powerful prismatic night field-\nglass which I had with me turned out to be farm lanterns.\nThursikuI, February \\6th, I returned home via Portmadoc, where\nI\n\fLI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 147\nMrs. Jones had been preaching, in order to investigate the local\nreport*. Here again I failed to obtain one single definite state\nment by an eye-witness.\nConclusion. \\ It is just possible that there may have been some\nlights caused by spontaneous ignition of phosphuretted hydrogen\ngenerated in the marsh at Egryn and distorted by mist, although\nI never saw any. Methane, or marsh gas, is never self-ignited, and\nmay be* left out of the question. The presence of atmospheric\nelectricity I think I have disproved.\nIn view of the fact that Mrs. Jones solemnly stated to me that\nVenus, which was particularly brilliant at that period, was a new\nstar, had only appeared since the Revival, and was situated a short\ndistance above her house, I think we may dismiss these lights as\nphantasies of overwrought brains.\nBERNARD B. REDWOOD.\n(18)\nFrom Mr. J. J., of D , Merionethshire. The original\naccount, which I received in January, 1905, is in Welsh; I\ngive here a translation of it :\nIn reference to the fire concerning which you wrote to me. There\nare several here who have seen it in varying forms\u2014sometimes near\nChapel Egryn, sometimes on the roof thereof, and sometimes some\nhalf mile or more from the place.\nWhen I saw it, it [was about half a mile from the chapel and\nabout a mile from where I stood. That was about 5 o'clock in the\nevening. The first form in which it appeared to me was that of a\npillar of clear fire quite perpendicular. It was about 2 feet wide\nand about 3 yards in height. Suddenly another small fire began\nby its side some 2 yards distant from the first pillar. It rapidly\nincreased until it assumed the same measurement and form as the\nfirst. Then another small fire suddenly arose on the other side of\nthe first pillar, and increased rapidly until it assumed the same size\nand form as the other two columns. So there were three pillars\nof the same size and form. And as I gazed upon them I saw two\narms of fire extending upwards from the top of each of the pillars.\nThe three pillars and their arms assumed exactly the same shape\nand remained so for about a minute or two. As I looked towards\nthe sky I saw smoke ascending from the pillars, and immediately\nthey began to disappear. Their disappearance was equally swift\n\f148 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nwith their growth. It was a gradual disappearance ; the fire became\nsmall and went out.\nI thought they were natural fire, but it was a very wonderful\nfire.

I do not propose to offer any kind\nof explanation. I leave that to you.\n(19)\nFrom Mr. L. M., of H .\nMay 30, 1905.\nWith regard to the lights which appear in this neighbourhood,\nperhaps one instance of my experience will suffice. I have been an\neye-witness of them on more than one occasion. I happened to be\nwith Mr. Beriah Evans, Carnarvon, on that night, the report of\nwhich has been given to the world by Mr. Evans himself. I can\ntestify to the truth of the report.\nThe night which I am going to relate you my experience was\nSaturday evening, March 25, 1905, when Mrs. Jones, the evangelist,\nof Egryn, was conducting a service in the Calvinistic Methodist\nChapel at Llanfair, a place about a mile and half from Harlech on\nthe main road between Harlech and Barmouth.\nMy wife and myself went down that night specially to see if the\nlight accompanied Mrs. Jones from outside Egryn. We happened\nto reach Llanfair about 9.15 p.m. It was a rather dark and damp\nevening. In nearing the chapel, which can be seen from a distance,\nwe saw balls of light, deep red, ascending from one side of the\nchapel, the side which is in a field. There was nothing in this\nfield to cause this phenomenon\u2014i.e. no houses, etc. After that we\nwalked to and fro on the main road for nearly two hours\nwithout seeing any light except from a distance in the direction of\nLlanbedr. This time it appeared brilliant, ascending high into the\nsky from amongst the trees where lives the well-known Rev.\nC. E. The distance between us and the light which appeared\nthis time was about a mile. Then about eleven o'clock, when the\nservice which Mrs. Jones conducted was brought to a close, two\nballs of light ascended from the same place and of similar appear\nance to those we saw first. In a few minutes afterwards Mrs.\nJones was passing us home in her carriage, and in a few seconds\nafter she passed, on the main road, and within a yard of us, there\nred a brilliant light twice, tinged with blue. In two or three\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 149\nseconds after this disappeared, on our right hand, within 150 or\n200 yards, there appeared twice very huge balls of similar appear\nance as that which appeared on the road. It was so brilliant and\npowerful this time that we were dazed for a second or two. Then\nimmediately there appeared a brilliant light ascending from the\nwoods where the Rev. C. E. lives. It appeared twice this time.\nOn the other side of the main road, close by, there appeared, ascend\ning from a field high into the sky, three balls of light, deep red.\nTwo of these appeared to split up, whilst the middle one remained\nunchanged. Then we left for home, having been watching these\nlast phenomena for a quarter of an hour.\nPerhaps I ought to say that I had an intense desire to see the\nlight this night for a special purpose ; in fact, I prayed for it, not\nas a mere curiosity, but for an higher object, which I need not\nmention. Some will ridicule this idea, but I have a great faith in\nprayer. . . .\nIn reply to questions about his experiences, Mr. M. stated\nthat he had never seen such lights before the Revival, nor\nbefore he had heard of others seeing them. He could not\nsay how often he had seen them, but he remembered the\ndates\u2014January 31st (this was the first time, and at H ),\nFeb. 1st, March 25th, and May 26th. They were seen \"high\nup in the sky, where no houses or anything else could lead\nus to make any mistake\" (i.e. to mistake ordinary lights for\nthem) ; they were seen both on very dark nights and also\nwhen the moon and stars were visible. He had never been\naffected in any particular way by seeing them, but had only\nfelt a curiosity to know their cause. Neither he nor Mrs.\nM. had had hallucinations on any other occasions.\nMrs. M. writes as follows :\nMay 29, 1905.\nMy husband wants me to write of what I have seen at P\nand heard when with Mrs. Jones, Egryn, March 15th. After the\nevening service we had a little way to walk from the town down\nto West-End, where we were staying. We both were invited to\nhave supper next door to where we were sleeping, so after supper\nwf went up to a sitting-room on the third floor. It seems that\nthey were having the lights at West-End since the Revival broke\nout at the commencement of the year above a little chapel of the\nMethodists, so they were very curious to see the lights this night,\n\f150 . Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nwhen Mrs. Jones was with them, so that they would be more\nsatisfied. We had no lights in the room. There were two windows\nto the room : just the room to have proper sight of the light if it\nwould come. Anyway, in a very little while we saw two balls of\nfire moving back and fro, but it was so very far we were not\nsatisfied with that. We were about twelve to eighteen in the\nroom. Eight were singing hymns, so as to pass the time in watch\ning and waiting for the lights. In a little while we had a better view,\nand, nearer us, several globes of light, some very light colour, and\nothers deep red. We were enjoying ourselves. I am well used to\nseeing that kind of light here.\nMy husband and I have witnessed the sight many a time here.\nWhen we saw the light ascending high in the air, like a cross, I\nfelt nervous, but it descended again nearer us\u2014a cross and two\nother crosses, one each side of the middle one. The two crosses\ncame nearer us now and stood not far from us, and dozens of small\nballs of fire dancing back and fro behind the crosses, and we heard\na voice singing.\nI have heard the singing once after at H , but differently\nto that at P , like a well-trained choir, and saw the cross the\nsame time on the sky. The two Misses G., , are witnesses\nof the cross in the sky and the singing.\nIn regard to this last account, I sent Mrs. M. the follow\ning questions, to each of which her answers are appended :\n(1) Was Mrs. Jones of Egryn one of the company that saw the\nlights on March 15 at P 1 Was she sitting with you in the\nsame room ?\u2014Yes.\n(2) Have you ever seen any such lights before the Revival began 1\n\u2014No, never.\n(3) Could you distinguish the tune or the words when the voices\nwere heard singing ? Was the tune familiar to you ?\u2014No.\n(4) Is it possible to tell me how often during the Revival you\nhave seen lights?\u2014I have seen them so often that I can't say the\nnumber. The dates when they were seen?\u2014The first week in\nJanuary was the first time. How often and when was the singing\nheard ?\u2014 Twice.\n(5) Will Miss G. send her account of the lights ?\u2014She wants me\nto say that she heard the singing with me.\nIn sending these answers Mrs. M. wrote that her friends\nwere unwilling to give their names for fear of its doing harm\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 151\nto Mrs. Jones ; they had seen lights since the beginning of\nthe Revival, but had never before had such a vision as on\nthe night described. Miss G. (who could not easily write\nEnglish) had asked her to write that they saw the light and\nheard the singing. She continues :\nThe last time we have seen the lights was 26th of May. I was\ngoing to bed. Saw two red lights outside the window after draw\ning the blind and lighting the candle. In about an hour my husband\nand self saw it in the room, brilliant. Haven't seen it since.\nIn a letter sent to me by Mrs. M., apparently referring to\nthe evening of March 15th, one of the witnesses says: \"We\nnever saw, though we have looked several times, such a light\nbefore or after that night.\"\n(20)\nFrom Dr. E. J. M., of Tylorstown.\nJune \\8th, 1905.\nAbout 10 p.m. on Saturday night I was coming home with Mrs.\nM. when she drew my attention to a bright light which could\nbe seen over Libanus (C.M.) Chapel, towards the side of the moun\ntain. It appeared as a ball of fire about the size of a cheese plate ;\nit was perfectly fixed.\nAs soon as I saw it I marked its position, in order to be sure\nthat it could not be due to some one with a light on the road\nwhich passes over the mountain, but its position was far enough\naway from the road.\nI then looked towards Stanley Town\u2014which is on the same side\nof the mountain in another direction, and which is nearer to the\nplace I was standing\u2014in order to compare the lights from the gas\nlamps on the road. There was no comparison between the lights,\nas the gas lamps were not nearly so brilliant as this light, and the\nlight I saw was of a more reddish colour.\nIt remained fixed in the same position for about three minutes,\nand then disappeared instantaneously. Mrs. Jones was in the chapel\nat the time holding a meeting. I may say that I was not thinking\nof the light at the time.\nIn conversation with Dr. M. on June 21st, 1905, he told\nme that afterwards he spoke to Mrs. Jones about the light,\nand she declared that she had seen it inside the chapel. On\n\f152 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\nmorn\n. \u00ab\nJune 27th he wrote to me that he had not had any con\nversation with her about the lights before he saw the light,\nwhich was on May 27th ; also, in answer to a question of\nmine on the subject, that he belonged to North Wales, having\nbeen born in Carnarvonshire.\nA photograph of the place where this incident occurred is\nreproduced above (see Plate I.).\n(21)\nFrom the Rev. E. W. E.\nJune 26, 1905.\nMrs. Jones of Egryn's last meeting at , being rather late\non Wednesday, May 24th, it was therefore after midnight that\nMrs. E. and myself retired upstairs to rest. After putting out the\nlight in our bedroom I could not go to bed. Then looked out of the\nwindow, but could see nothing. Then I went to the back bed\nroom, where our two boys sleep ; and whilst I was looking out of\nthis window towards the Penrhys hill, my wife came behind and\nput her hand on my shoulder, then asked me if I were looking for\nsomething. I said yes, that I was looking for something strange,\nbecause I felt very strange. Mrs. E. had just pushed the curtain\non one side when she exclaimed, \" There's something ! \" I said,\n*' Where?\" When she told me the direction I then exclaimed,\n\"Yes, really, there is the strange light.\" It appeared to us in\nthe form of a column of fire about two feet wide and several\nfeet high, quite distinct, and of the tint of a fiery vapour.\nAfter looking at the column for a second or two, then some bright\nballs of fire appeared in the column near its base, then these\nbrilliant balls would burst and disappear upwards. Then the column\nwould disappear, but in a moment would appear again in the same\nform, in the very same spot, and then the balls would appear in\nthe column, and the balls burst and disappear upwards in the same\nway. This we distinctly saw six times (6 times).\nIt was, as nearly as we could judge, about 12.45 on Thursday\nmorn, May 25, and lasted in all about three minutes.\nI saw Mr. E. on June 21, 1905, and he pointed out to\nthe exact spot on the hillside where the light appeared\nThe spot in this case is on the western side of the\n(lt was on the eastern in Dr. M.'s case) ; no houses\n\fULJ Psychological As-pects of the Welsh Revival. 153\nnear. There is a path by a wall, and it was at a slight break\non the top line of the wall that the light appeared to be.\nI afterwards sent a series of questions to Mr. E., which I\nprint here with his answers, dated June 28th, 1905:\n(1) Have you ever seen a corpse-light?\u2014No.\n(2) Is your birth-place in South or North Wales ?\u2014Dowlais, Glam.\nAlso, my father and my mother were born at Dowlais.\n(3) Have you seen much of Mrs. Jones before or during her\nvisit ?\u2014Never before her coming here, and only at our meetings,\nuntil the Saturday after I saw the strange light. Then I had, with\na few others, about two hours' semi-private conversation with Mrs.\nJones.\n(4) Did you hope or expect to see any lights?\u2014No. Neither\nMrs. E. nor myself had any desire or longing to see the light.\nI feel almost certain that what Mrs. Jones said in the meetings about\nthe lights that appeared to her around Egryn, near Barmouth, could\nhave nothing to do with the form, the time, or the place of the\nstrange light Mrs. E. and myself saw.\nMrs. E. does not understand Welsh, so Mrs. Jones' addresses\n\u2022could have no direct influence upon her. Mrs. E.'s report of\nwhat she saw would be similar to mine, and I believe that I sent\nyou as faithful and accurate a report of what we saw, and how and\nwhen we saw it, as can be put in a few written words.\n(22)\nThe next two accounts were given in Welsh, and are\ntranslated here. Both Mrs. L. and Mrs. W. are North Walians.\nMrs. L., whose account I received on June 26th, 1905, de\nscribes her experience as follows :\nOne night, when Mrs. Jones was staying in my house, we prayed\nto see the light. About 1 a.m. we were standing on the door-step,\nand I saw a strange light about forty or fifty yards away. It\nappeared about 1^ feet from the ground. About oval in shape.\nCannot describe colour. It seemed to be moving and sparks flying\nout of it. It appeared for a few minutes, and disappeared in the\nform of sparks.\nMrs. W. says :\nI was praying in the house one night, and afterwards went to\nthe door and saw on the opposite side of the valley, on the side\nof the hill, a column of fire like a cloud, and I prayed for seeing\n\f154 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\nit nearer, and it appeared nearer in a round dark column, and a\nlight appeared underneath it. On another night I saw it appearing\nin the shape of a house with three windows. Afterwards it appeared\nin the shape of a chapel\u2014very much like the chapel attended by\nMrs. Jones in North Wales.\nAfterwards I saw it in the shape of an eye right in front of\nme, and the eye broke in two, and the two parts fell downwards\nand joined again, and appeared in the form of a man.\nI prayed another night, and something came towards my mouth,\nand I felt it like hot iron, and it nearly took away my breath.\nAnother vision appeared to me in the form of a man approaching\nme with a small dish in his hand, and he said, \"Take and eat\"\nI did not feel inclined to take it, but as I respected the person, I\ntook it. And after I took it, he said, \"Go and preach the Gospel\nto every creature.\"\n(23)\nFrom Mr. W. P., of D , M . The account,\nwhich I received on February 11th, 1905, has two signa\ntures, the second one being presumably that of Mr. P.'s\nsister.\nThe only positive light I saw was a small one proceeding before\nme on a quiet road on the way to chapel on a very dark night,\nwhich I could not account for.\nWhat my sister saw was something like a ball of light arising\nfrom the ground to a great height, and all was light around it\neverywhere. One end seemed to descend again to the ground till\nit looked like the shape of a rainbow of white light and disappeared.\nAbout the end of January the last one was seen ; what I saw was\nsome time before.\n(24)\nFrom Mr. W. M., of Welshpool. The account was received\non March 13th, 1905.\nI personally saw no lights and heard no sounds ; but my wife\nsaw a bright light, as it were, reflected on the ceiling, but it was\nmuch brighter and of a whiter hue than the reflection from any\nlamp. It occurred, as nearly as I can remember, about a month\nago, but I have no idea as to the time, only that it was at night.\nIt was circular in shape, and a little larger than the rim of an\nordinary tea-cup, and lasted, as nearly as I can gather, about a\nminute or so.\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 155\n(25)\nFrom Mr. T. J., of L , near W ; translated from\nthe original Welsh narrative.\nMarch 11th, 1905.\nThere was a united meeting at the Wesleyan Chapel on\nSaturday night, January 14th, 1905. We came out and went home\nafter the first meeting, but several of the young people remained to\nconduct a second meeting, in which it broke out into praise through\nout the place. It is impossible to say how many took part in prayer\nthat night. A great difficulty was had to restore order, and the\nmeeting was ended a little before half-past eleven. We had some\nwhere about a mile and a half of road to go home, and that in\nthe direction of the east from the village where the chapel stands.\nWhen we were about the back of some ten minutes to reach\nhome (we reached about 10.45 p.m.) we were coming up a small\nhill. There were there another man and his wife besides myself\n\u00bbnd my wife coming together. We\u2014the two men\u2014were coming\ntogether, and the two women likewise were coming together after\n08.\nSuddenly I saw the thing most like that I can describe to that\nwhich is called by us the falling of a star. It ran downwards, form\ning as it ran a kind of long tail, and as it approached the earth\nit widened a little into small sparks, and it fell into the earth, as\nit were the other side of the hedge from us, but I cannot say how\nnear, but it was not far.\nMy wife, M. J., was coming with Mrs. J. a little behind\nus, as I have already said, and she saw it, a kind of light, on\nthe backs of us two men\u2014some kind of light which she never\nsaw the like of before, and it vanished downwards in the direction\nof the earth, and that is all we saw.\nWe heard no kind of sound whatever, and the light was all the\nsame colour.\n(26)\nFrom Mr. E. P. G.\nJune 20lh, 1905.\nIn the autumn of 1876 I attended a number of spiritualist seances,\nnearly all without a paid medium, and chiefly with the same people\nmeeting at their own houses. In October or November my sister\nand myself dined with Mrs. S., her daughter being there also.\nWe were to go on and meet Major and Mrs. 0., who were\n\f156 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [past\nentertaining the medium, Miss M. I had often sat with her\nas medium, and she generally was a writing medium, either by\nplanchette or direct. As we were getting ready after dinner Major\nO. drove up and said a servant had been taken suddenly ill,\nand we must have the meeting at Mrs. S.'s. The dining-room\nwas cleared, and Mr. O., Miss M., and a friend of Mrs. 0-\n(I think a cousin) came ; I cannot remember her name. We\nsat round the dining-room table in total darkness, some gleams\nof light from the street lamp having been noticed and the curtains\ncarefully pinned together by the Major and myself. I sat next\nMrs. S. and between her and Miss M., 0. being on the other\nside of Miss M. I do not recollect how the other four\u2014Mrs.\nO., Miss S., my sister, and the cousin\u2014sat. We sat in silence\nfor some time, nearly half an hour. At intervals O. asked Miss\nM. if she felt the power. At last I felt twitching motions in\nher arms, our hands touching, and expected the usual writing,\ntwitching and jerking generally preceding her writing. I looked\nup, and saw five small lights moving in the air. They seemed\nto be near the ceiling, but not touching it. The motion was slow\nand irregular. They seemed to follow no rules. At times all close\ntogether, then moving irregularly about in curves and circles, but\n\"never descending lower. So far as I could judge, they kept the\nsame height all the time. The room was a large high one, probably\ntwelve feet in height. I made no remark, and wondered if others\nsaw it. I must have watched for more than a minute when Miss\nM. said suddenly, \" The power is very strong,\" and then, \" They\nare here.\" My sister told me afterwards she had noticed the lights\nbefore Miss M. spoke. I watched the lights in their movements\nfor some time, when 0. said, \"Shall I ask!\" Miss M. inter\nrupted, saying, \"Wait.\" Some time passed, and Miss M. twitched\nmore sharply, and I turned to her. As I did so I heard Mrs.\nS. say, \" Ah ! \" and, looking up, found the lights had ceased.\nIn the dark it is difficult to estimate time accurately, but I\nthink it was from five to seven minutes from the time I first\nsaw them to their disappearance. Mrs. S. told me they grew\nvery faint quickly, and then disappeared. My sister said the same.\nThe light was that of a tiny luminous globe, very soft, but Dot\ngiving off any appreciable illumination. I tried to see the hook in\nthe ceiling from which a lamp sometimes hung, but failed to see\nit. They were quite unlike the light of fire-flies, and their motion\nquite different. Two were rather larger than the others.\n\fli] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 157\nI made careful notes on getting home, and next morning gave\nthem to my sister to correct, but she found her recollections tallied\nwith mine. I went to several pyrotechnists to see if there were\nany substances that would produce such a light, but failed.\n(27)\nThe following are the accounts of some of the witnesses who\nsaw the light at Ynysybwl on July 23rd, 1905.\n(a) From Mr. M. J. P.\nAugust 3rd, 1905.\nRs the lights seen at Ynysybwl on the 23rd of July last, I am\nsending you my version of the affair, as I had the pleasure of\nseeing it, which was as follows :\nI went on the night of the 23rd, which was Sunday, for a\nwalk after supper ; although not in the habit of taking a walk,\nsomething compelled me to go, so in company with a few friends\nwe went along the street for a short distance, when we were\nattracted by a voice raised in prayer on the mountain side, and\nwe at once wended our way thither, where we had the pleasure\nof joining in with the company already assembled in prayer and\npraise to God, and our Maker met with us, and we received a great\nblessing to each of our souls, praise God. Well, after about an\nhour and a half we drew the meeting to a close, and commenced\nour way homeward. By now we had got as far as what is called the\nRobert Town Square, when we again commenced to praise God,\nwhen my attention was suddenly drawn to a mysterious light which\nappeared in the sky, which I had the pleasure of seeing. Firstly,\nit appeared to my startled gaze to be a ball of light about the\nsize of the moon, with a slight mist over it. I gazed at it for\na short time and then the stars began to shoot out around it :\nthen it gradually rose higher in the heavens, and as it rose it\ngrew brighter and smaller and the smaller it got the brighter it\nseemed to grow, and the last I saw of it, it was a little larger\nthan the evening star, and very bright. I might also say that\nwhile the mist covered the light it would open and brighten at\nintervals, so that [is] all I saw of the Mysterious Light.\nNow, sir, that is the manner in which I saw the light, as also\ndid my brother. I might also say that I am not of an excitable\nnature, therefore do not run away with the idea that what I saw\nwas pure imagination brought on by an excitable nature, because\nif you do, you will be altogether mistaken.\n\f158 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART\n(6) From Mr. R. J.\nAugust 2nd, 1905.\nRe the light seen at Ynysybwl on Sunday night, the 23rd of\nJuly, I am sending you my version of the matter as seen by\nmyself, which is as follows :\nI might say to commence that I as a Sunday School teacher,\nwith the most of my class, eleven in number, went on Sunday\nevening to a place called Ynysyboeth, a distance of about five miles,\nto a service conducted by Mrs. Jones, Egryn, the lady that has\nbeen seeing all the mysterious lights. So we enjoyed ourselves\ngrand, and after the close of the meeting we went our way back\nhome to Ynysybwl ; but we arrived so far as the mountain side\nthat leads down to Ynysybwl, when we felt as if we were com\npelled to hold a prayer meeting there, which we did, and was in\na very short time joined by a godly company, where we met with\nGod in prayer and praise, and God wonderfully blessed us in our\nsouls, and encouraged us to press on to that mark of our calling,\nwhich is in Christ Jesus, and also to show us that He was pleased\nwith us, we had a convert. Praise God for it. Now don't you\nthink God met with us ? We closed there in about an hour and\na half, and went down homewards ; but when we got to a place\ncalled Robert Town Square, we again started to praise God, but\nwe had hardly started when the mysterious light already referred\nto appeared, which as I saw it is as follows :\nFirst of all my attention was drawn to it by a person in the\ncrowd, and I looked and saw a block of fire as it was rising\nfrom the mountain side, and it followed along the mountain side\nfor about 200 or 300 yards, before it gradually rose to heaven.\nThen a star, as it were, shot out to meet it, and they clapped\ntogether and formed into a ball of fire. It also grew brighter as\nit rose higher, and then it seemed to sway about a lot ; then it\nseemed to form into something like the helm of a ship. The size\nof it at this time would be about the size of the moon, but very\nmuch brighter, and lasted about a quarter of an hour. I then\nwent home to call my wife to see it (which is a distance of about\n300 yards), and [the] strange [thing] about it was I could not see\nit from there, although my home faces the mountain side. But\nwhen I got back to the square already mentioned it was again\nquite visible. This, sir, is the manner in which I saw the light;\nmind, saw it, I mean, not imagined it ; not at all.\n\fu.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 159\n(e) From Mr. J. J. The account was received on August 6th,\n1905.\nla accordance with my promise to you I write you a full account\n\u2022of how I saw the \"light.\" Eleven of us from Ynysybwl had gone\n\u2022over one Sunday evening to Ynysyboeth to a meeting at which\nMrs, Jones, Egryn, was present. We hail a grand meeting, and\ntwo sinners gave themselves up. After the meeting was over, we\nmade our way homeward, singing hymns all the way to Abercynon.\nAfter starting across the mountain, some of us felt incliued to have\na prayer meeting, but the majority were for having it on the\nYnysybwl side, and a glorious meeting it was. The heavenly powers\ndescended with force, and another convert was made.\nWe had now swelled considerably in number, and proceeded to\nthe square opposite the Robert Town Hotel, and while we were\nsinging the star appeared, like a ball of fire in the sky, glittering\nand sparkling, and as it went up it seemed to be bubbling over.\nThis continued for about 20 minutes. . . .\n(d) From Mrs. C. J. The account was received early in\nAugust, 1905.\nThe manner in which the lights appeared to me at the Robert\nTown Hotel Square was as follows :\nFirstly, there appeared in the heavens a very large and bright\ntall of fire. It was of a much more brilliant lustre than an\n-ordinary star\u2014very much the colour of a piece of iron white-heated.\nIt had two brilliant arms which protruded towards the earth.\n\"Between these arms there appeared a further light or lights\nresembling a cluster of stars, which seemed to be quivering with\nvarying brightness. This was its form when I saw it, but others\nwho had seen it before me had noticed it growing from smaller\n\u2022dimensions. It lasted for ten minutes or more.\n(e) From Miss A. J.\nAugust 5th, 1905.\nHe the mysterious light or star which I saw on Sunday night\nor rather Monday morning of the July 23rd, about 12.30 o'clock\n-a.m. :\nThe manner it appeared to me was, firstly, a ball of misty light\nin the heavens about 7 or 8 inches in diameter. It was very\nmisty when it appeared first to me, then it got very much brighter,\nas its brilliancy became undescribable, the ball grew very much\n\f160 . . Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part\nlarger, and farming an oval shape, it quivered and glittered very\nmuch.\nThen there appeared to be two great long streaks of misty light\ncoming from the ball forming something like the shape drawn;\nthose almost reached the earth.\nI may say that I never saw anything so wonderful and bright,\nit was most inspiring, and lasted for about ten minutes. It could\nnot have been any imagination, for there was not any one thinking\nof any such things until very suddenly our attraction was drawn\nto it.\nThe late Dean Howell, Dean of St. David, wrote to the Cyfaill\nEgltcysig (a Welsh monthly) in December, 1902, just before his death,\na last message on the need of Wales. This letter ended, \" If I\nknew that this was my last message to my countrymen all over\nWales, before I am summoned to judgment and with the light\nof eternity already dawning over me, this is my message, vit.\nthat the principal need of my country and dear nation at this\ntime is\u2014spiritual revival through a special downpouring of the Holy\nSpirit.\"\nWhen this was first published in the Cyfaill it attracted con\nsiderable notice, and my friend who supplies the translation is not\nalone in believing that it had much to do with the creation of\nthe Revival atmosphere. The republication of the message in the\nCymru, a Welsh monthly of large circulation, in November, 1904,\nprobably helped to extend interest in the Revival, especially\namongst persons who saw in the movement a response to the\nDean's fervent words.\nNote.\u2014In his Presidential Address (1897) \\ Sir William Crookes\ngave a table of the velocity of vibrations in 63 steps, and suggested\nthat the \"X-rays\" would be found to lie between the 58th and\n62nd steps, and he added that, \"It seems to me that in these\nrays we may have a possible mode of transmitting intelligence.\n. . . Let it be conceived that the brain contains a centre which\nuses these rays as the vocal chords use sound vibrations and sends\nthem out, with the velocity of light, to impinge on the receiving\nganglion of another brain. In this way some of the phenomena\nof telepathy and the transmission of intelligence from one sensitive\nto another through long distances, seem to come into the domain\n1 See Proceedings 8.P.R., Vol. XII., p. 338.\n\fLL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 161\nof law, and can be grasped. ... Is it inconceivable that intense\nthought concentrated towards a sensitive with whom the thinker is in\nclose sympathy may induce a telepathic chain of brain-waves, along\nwhich the message of thought can go straight to its goal without\nloss of energy due to distance 1 \"\nI have suggested in the S.P.R. Journal (April, 1905), that the\ncontents of a telepathic message probably amount in volume to no\nmore than a word or two, as in code telegraphy, and that the\nenlargement of the message into a scene or lengthy verbal com\nmunication is the work of the recipient mind.\nAccepting the probability of a brain wave of sufficient intensity\nto carry a word or sign to a mind in conscious or unconscious\n-sympathy with the agent, it would appear that the operation within\nthe brain of the recipient, if sensitive to the message, is of a\ntotally different character. The mind then is not simply perceptive\nbut constructive. and, needless to say, works by the ordinary\nmachinery and vibratory methods it daily employs. The message is\nrealised in the form of sounds, changes of temperature, or visions, in\naccordance with the mental potentiality of the percipient. Whether\nthe difference in mode of realisation has any relation or not to the\nmental capacity and habitual thought methods of the operator in\nother matters might be worth examination. At any rate, the limita\ntion of the initial message to an agent's word or sign, and the\nattribution of the resultant sounds or sights to the percipient, not\nonly goes far to explain \" the clothes of ghosts \" and the elabora\ntion of scenic settings, the misunderstandings and erroneous\nimpressions, that are found in our records, but may do a little\nto remove some of the objections to telepathy felt by many\nscientific minds even when they are the subjects of its operation.\n\f162 Professor Charles Richet.

[part\nactuel, la guerre russo-japonaise, dont nous avions parl\u00e9 aussi;\net enfin pour la phrase (xv), ce jour-l\u00e0 m\u00eame Mme X. avait\nfredonn\u00e9 \u00e0 diverses reprises une vieille chanson fran\u00e7aise\n(Monsieur et Madame Denis), dont le refrain est \" Souvenez-\nvous-en,\" et elle m'avait demand\u00e9 si je la connaissais.\nAu point de vue de la signification g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de ces phrases\ngrecques, sans nous occuper maintenant de leur origine, on\npeut leur assigner, quant \u00e0 leur finalit\u00e9 en quelque sorte, une\ndouble cause.\nDans un cas, elles ont pour but de donner une preuve\nmat\u00e9rielle, technique pour ainsi dire, de la connaissance et\ncompr\u00e9hension du grec (citations longues\u2014soleil et ombres\nallong\u00e9es\u2014copie conforme \u00e0 l'original, etc.).\nDans l'autre cas, ce sont des id\u00e9es g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, un peu mystiques\n\u00e0 ce qu'il semble, sur la voie \u00e0 suivre, sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de\npoursuivre l'\u00e9tude des myst\u00e8res (v), l'imperfection de la sagesse\nhumaine (i), etc.\nDe sorte que, malgr\u00e9 l'apparente incoh\u00e9rence de ces phrases,\non d\u00e9couvre la trame serr\u00e9e d'une sorte de pens\u00e9e directrice\ncherchant \u00e0 atteindre par deux voies diff\u00e9rentes le m\u00eame but\nTels sont donc, en somme, les faits dont je vais chercher\nl'explication, avec tous les d\u00e9tails n\u00e9cessaires. i\nIII.\nJe dirai tout d'abord, pour simplifier, que les trois seules\nhypoth\u00e8ses que dans l'\u00e9tat actuel de la science on puisse\n\u00e9mettre, sont : (1), une fraude consciente, astucieuse, voulue,\nprolong\u00e9e et habile ; (2), une m\u00e9moire inconsciente de choses\nvues et oubli\u00e9es ; (3), l'intelligence d'un esprit p\u00e9n\u00e9trant l'intelli\ngence de Mme X. Or ces trois explications me paraissent\ntoutes trois \u00e9galement absurdes .et impossibles.\nJe vais les examiner librement l'une apr\u00e8s l'autre.\n(1) D'abord qu'il me soit permis de demander pardon \u00e0\nMme X. de discuter l'hypoth\u00e8se de la fraude volontaire. Je\nconnais sa loyaut\u00e9 irr\u00e9prochable, et je m'en porte garant\ncomme s'il s'agissait de moi-m\u00eame. Mais c'est une dure n\u00e9cessit\u00e9\nde ces sortes d'exp\u00e9riences d'exiger autre chose qu'un acte de\nfoi. M\u00eame s'il s'agissait de moi, je serais contraint de donner\ndes preuves autres que des preuves morales. Ces preuves\n\fLi.] X\u00e9noglossie. 179\nmorales, si puissantes qu'elles soient pour moi, ne suffiront pas\naux autres, et je dois, ainsi que Mme X. me l'a elle-m\u00eame\ninstamment demand\u00e9, examiner en toute ind\u00e9pendance cette\nquestion de fraude, et faire comme s'il ne s'agissait pas\nd'une personne dont la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 est au-dessus de tout soup\u00e7on.\nD'abord Mme X. ne sait pas le grec. Certes il est impossible\nde prouver d'une mani\u00e8re absolue qu'on ne sait pas une langue.\nQuoiqu'on puisse facilement prouver qu'on conna\u00eet une langue\n\u00e9trang\u00e8re ; il est radicalement impossible de prouver qu'on\nYignore. Pourtant, on peut arriver \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que le grec est\nune langue difficile \u00e0 savoir, et qu'on ne l'apprend pas au pied\nlev\u00e9 ; que Mme X. n'a jamais, ni dans son enfance, ni plus\ntard, \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les livres grecs ; que ni ses amis, ni moi, nous\nne l'avons jamais vue \u00e9tudier le grec ; et que par cons\u00e9quent,\nm\u00eame a priori, l'invraisemblance qu'elle a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 et qu'elle\nconna\u00eet le grec est extr\u00eame.\nIl faut faire une r\u00e9serve lorsqu'il est dit qu'elle n'a vu ni\nne poss\u00e8de de livres grecs. En effet, au mois de novembre\n1899, quelques jours avant la premi\u00e8re visite que je devais\nlui faire, elle se sentit soudain envahie par le d\u00e9sir d'apprendre\nle grec, et alors elle s'adressa \u00e0 une dame de ses amies, et\nla pria de lui procurer quelques livres grecs. Mme Z. acheta\nalors deux petits livres classiques, d'occasion, macul\u00e9s par les\n\u00e9coliers qui y avaient travaill\u00e9, et portant encore les taches\net les dessins dont sont coutumiers les enfants ; ces deux livres,\nM\u2122* X. ne les regarda m\u00eame pas. Il para\u00eet qu'il lui suffit\nde les avoir. Elle les mit dans un recoin de sa biblioth\u00e8que\nsans les regarder davantage. Ce sont les Premiers exercices\ngrecs de l'abb\u00e9 Ragon (12e \u00e9dition, Paris, Poussielgue, 1898),\net la Chrestomathie grecque, par l'abb\u00e9 Ragon (4\u00b0 \u00e9dition.\nParis, Poussielgue, 1897).\nJ'ai longuement examin\u00e9 ces deux livres. Il ne s'y trouve\nrien qui ressemble de pr\u00e8s ou de loin aux phrases qui ont\n\u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es; il n'y a m\u00eame pas d'alphabet grec. Le mot\navdpunrtva, qui est dans la premi\u00e8re phrase \u00e9crite en novembre\n1899, ne se trouve ni dans l'un ni dans l'autre de ces deux\nouvrages, au petit lexique sommaire qui leur est annex\u00e9.\nD'ailleurs, cette constatation \u00e9tait assez inutile, puisque les\nlivres de Ragon sont des livres de grec ancien, et qu'il s'agit\ndans les manuscrits donn\u00e9s par Mme X. de grec moderne.\n\f180 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nII est inutile d'ajouter que Mmo X. n'a jamais vu le\ndictionnaire de Byzantios, et que la premi\u00e8re fois qu'elle a\naper\u00e7u cet ouvrage, \u00e7'a \u00e9t\u00e9 quand je le lui ai apport\u00e9 le 2 mai,\napr\u00e8s que toutes les phrases grecques rapport\u00e9es plus haut\navaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites par elle.\nDonc, en toute \u00e9vidence, Mme X. ne sait pas le grec, et ce\nqui vient corroborer avec une autorit\u00e9 irr\u00e9futable cette affirma\ntion, c'est que dans ses \u00e9crits grecs il y a des fautes telles\nqu'elles ne peuvent \u00eatre commises par quelqu'un qui conna\u00eet\nle grec, m\u00eame tr\u00e8s superficiellement. Ainsi, par exemple, tu\n\u00e0vTiypadtov pour to \u00e0vTlypacpov ; \u00e8v wap\u00f4Sd) pour \u00e8v irap\u00f4ou ;\nfiucpo-v pour fiticpov, etc. Ce sont l\u00e0 des fautes qu'un \u00e9colier,\ndeux semaines de rudiment, ne commettrait pas.\nJe donnerai une autre preuve encore, tout \u00e0 fait technique,\npour montrer que Mme X \u00e9crit le grec comme une personne\nqui ne le conna\u00eet pas.\nMon ami J. H\u00e9ricourt, dans une \u00e9tude attentive faite \u00e0\npropos d'un document c\u00e9l\u00e8bre (le fameux papier de l'affaire\nDreyfus) a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'\u00e9criture courante, vue \u00e0 une tr\u00e8s\nforte loupe ou reproduite avec grossissement par la photographie,\nn'\u00e9tait ni trembl\u00e9e ni irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, tandis qu'il en \u00e9tait autre\nment pour l'\u00e9criture imit\u00e9e. Celle-l\u00e0 est trembl\u00e9e, irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re,\ntrahissant l'h\u00e9sitation dans le graphisme ; de sorte que l'on\npeut, en \u00e9tudiant \u00e0 la loupe une \u00e9criture quelconque, recon\nna\u00eetre, selon qu'elle est tremblante ou non, si c'est une\n\u00e9criture courante ou une \u00e9criture imit\u00e9e. Or l'\u00e9criture grecque\nde Mme X est tr\u00e8s trembl\u00e9e, tout \u00e0 fait comme le serait celle\nd'une personne qui n'\u00e9crit pas le grec couramment, mais en\nle copiant, sans pouvoir l'\u00e9crire, d'apr\u00e8s une image qu'elle a\ndevant les yeux.\nDonc, en r\u00e9sumant toute cette discussion, j'arrive \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer\ncomme d\u00fbment et solidement \u00e9tabli que Mme X. ne sait pas le\ngrec.\nJ'aborde maintenant ce qui est le fonds m\u00eame de la question,\n\u00e0 savoir pourquoi la similitude rigoureuse, absolue, entre les\nphrases grecques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites soit devant moi, soit en\nmon absence, et les phrases que l'on trouve en divers endroits\ndu dictionnaire de Byzantios.\nKemarquons d'abord que l'exemplaire que je poss\u00e8de m'a \u00e9t\u00e9,\nvers le 1er avril de cette ann\u00e9e, envoy\u00e9 d'Ath\u00e8nes, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9\n\fLL] Xenoglossie. 181\nirnprime a Athenes, et qu'il n'en existe probablement pas\nbeaucoup d'exemplaires & Paris. Je me suis adresse\" a un\nlibraire de Paris qui m'a dit ne pouvoir s'en procurer qu'en\nle faisant venir d'Athenes meme. L'autre exemplaire (1\" e\"di\ntion), provient de la Bibliotheque nationale. Cela ne veut pas\ndire assortment que cet ouvrage ne puisse se rencontrer quel-\nque part a Paris ; mais il est tres rare, a coup sur. J'admets\nfort bien qu'il en existe (ou qu'il en a existe), a Paris ; mais\nc'est un livre tree rare, a coup sur; ce n'est pas un livre\nde classe, car nos jeunes e\"coliers n'apprennent jamais le grec\nmodeme ; et les dictionnaires grecs qu'on peut se procurer\noouramment sont tous, sans exception, des dictionnaires de grec\nancien.\nPourtant il est e\"vident que la relation entre les phrases\necrites par Mme X. et les phrases du dictionnaire de Byzan-\ntios n'est pas fortuite. A partir de la phrase vi, jusqu'a la\nphrase xv, toutes les citations, les longues et les courtes, se\ntrouvent dans le dictionnaire dont elles sont la transcription\nrigoureuse. On peut done dire qu'apres le mois de juin 1900,\ntoutes les phrases grecques Ecrites par Mme X. sont des phrases\ndu dictionnaire grec susdit.\nJ'ai de\"ja dit que je me refusais, pour des raisons morales,\nqui me paraissent primordiales, a admettre 1'hypothese d'une\nfraudf-. Mais laissons de cuu- les raisons morales, si puis-\nsantes a mes yeux. II est des raisons materielles, aussi\npuissantes, qui concourent a rendre cette hypothese absurde.\n(1) II est mate\"riellement impossible, e\"tant donne\"es nos\nconnaissauces actuelles sur les limites de la me\"moire humaine,\nqu'il y ait une transcription exacte et complete, en une langue\ninconnue, de toute une se\"rie de phrases, avec ponctuation,\npoints et accents, comme pour les phrases, ix, x, xi, xii, xiii,\nxiv, xv, qui ont e^e\" e\"crites devant moi, dans 1'espace d'une\nhenre a peine.\nCela est d'autant plus impossible qu'il s'agit d'une trans\ncription visuelle, puisqu'il y a SfM\\oVs pour o\/wXouv ; o-oXio-\/uui5y\npour a-ro\\ta-ftovy ; irapoStp pour irapoSw ; ce serait done une\ntranscription sans nulle lecture prealable, puisque la lecture\naurait donne oiau\\ow, arro\\iarfJLOvii, et irapoSw. Par consequent\nc'est une transcription de signes n'ayant aucun sens, puisque\naussi bien la terminologie grecque restait ignoree\n\f182 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nJ'ai fait le compte, par curiosit\u00e9, des lettres et accents\ngrecs ainsi \u00e9crits sous mes yeux, eu conformit\u00e9 avec les phrases\ndu dictionnaire. Le nombre en est de 622 (phrases ix \u00e0 xv).\nLes erreurs ou omissions sont au nombre de 42 ; cela fait\ndonc une proportion de 6,7 pour cent d'omissions ou d'erreurs.\nAinsi, 622 signes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crits, avec seulement 6 pour cent\nd'erreurs.\nA ces 622 signes il faut en ajouter 913 qui sont dans la\nlettre qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e, \u00e9crite, ainsi qu'il m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit,\ndans les m\u00eames conditions; au total 1535 signes, \u00e9crits de\nm\u00e9moire, sans compr\u00e9hension du texte.\nSupposer qu'une m\u00e9moire humaine ait cette puissance, c'est\nd\u00e9passer les limites de l'invraisemblable.\n('2) Voici une seconde d\u00e9monstration plus nette encore. La\nphrase du d\u00e9but \" Xpijo-dai,\" etc. (viiiA), n'est pas donn\u00e9e en\nfran\u00e7ais dans le dictionnaire grec de Byzantios. Elle est\nseulement donn\u00e9e en latin, et dans le latin de Cic\u00e9ron, assez\ndifficile \u00e0 comprendre, quand on n'a pas fait l'\u00e9tude sp\u00e9ciale\ndu latin.\nJe mets en fait qu'une personne qui ne sait pas tr\u00e8s bien\nle latin ne pourra pas comprendre ces mots: Graecis licet utare,\ncum voles, si te latinae forte deficiant. On arriverait donc \u00e0\ncette absurdit\u00e9 que Mme X., tout en ne connaissant pas le\ngrec, conna\u00eet le latin, puisqu'elle a employ\u00e9 pour dire ce\nqu'elle voulait dire une phrase grecque (qu'elle ne comprenait\npas), traduite d'une phrase latine (qu'elle ne pouvait pas com\nprendre davantage). Il y a l\u00e0 une seconde manifeste absurdit\u00e9.\n(3) Le fait que la phrase ix a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite devant moi,\navec autant de perfection dans la transcription que les phrases\nviii A., B., et D. rend extr\u00eamement vraisemblable que ces\nphrases ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites dans les m\u00eames conditions que la phrase\nix. Les modalit\u00e9s de l'\u00e9criture sont identiques. Ainsi par\nexemple le mot fiucpo-v pour nucp\u00f4v. La proportion des accents\nest \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la m\u00eame; dans un rapport de 66 pour cent\npour les phrases \u00e9crites en mon absence ; tandis que dans les\nphrases \u00e9crites devant moi, le rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 86 pour cent.\nLes accents ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 bien plus correctement et compl\u00e8te\nment mis dans les phrases \u00e9crites sous mes yeux que dans\nles phrases \u00e9crites en mon absence.\nDonc toutes les citations de la traduction de Bernardin\n\fLi.] X\u00e9noglossie. 183\nde Saint-Pierre, et de la traduction d'Eug\u00e8ne Sue, ont \u00e9t\u00e9\ndonn\u00e9es dans les m\u00eames conditions que la phrase ix, r\u00e9cem\nment \u00e9crite devant moi.\n(4) Dans le dictionnaire de Byzantios, il y a un dictionnaire\nfran\u00e7ais-grec et un dictionnaire grec-fran\u00e7ais. Or toutes les\nphrases que je viens de citer sont puis\u00e9es dans le diction\nnaire grec-fran\u00e7ais ; autrement dit, dans un dictionnaire dont\non ne peut se servir qu'en connaissant le grec, pour\ntraduire du grec en fran\u00e7ais. Car, si l'on veut traduire du\nfran\u00e7ais en grec, on ne trouve dans ce dictionnaire que\nle mot seul, sans qu'il soit accompagn\u00e9 d'une phrase\nd\u00e9taill\u00e9e ou explicative ; de sorte que, pour exprimer une\nid\u00e9e (pour faire, autrement dit, un th\u00e8me grec, ce qui serait\nle cas), ce lexique tr\u00e8s abr\u00e9g\u00e9 ne donne aucune des phrases\nsusdites. Donc il faut savoir le grec pour employer l'autre\ndictionnaire grec-fran\u00e7ais ; autrement dit, le dictionnaire est\nfait pour la version grecque et non pour le tMme grec. Cette\nremarque est d'une importance majeure ; car on comprend\nmal que ce qu'on veut dire puisse \u00eatre dit, uniquement \u00e0\nl'aide d'un dictionnaire fait pour la version. Par exemple,\nsupposons un \u00e9colier qui veuille dire : \" L'\u00e9criture ressemble \u00e0\nl'original,\" ou : \" La copie est comme le livre \" ; il trouvera \u00e0\n\u00e9criture ypacp^ ; ypa(pta\/xov ; \u00e0 manuscrit xeip\u00f4ypacpo\u00e7 ; \u00e0 copie\n\u00e0irrlypa<pov, \u00d9iro\/xifxtj\/xa ; d'autre part \u00e0 ressembler il lira\noXXa\u00c7w ; \u00e0 semblable S\/xoio\u00e7, irap\u00e0fioio\u00e7 ; et \u00e0 impression\nTVirwai\u00e7 ; \u00e0 livre \/3!\/3Xiot> ; \u00e0 original irpayroTviro\u00e7. De sorte\nqu'il y aura sept \u00e0 huit phrases possibles. Or justement la\nphrase qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite est identique \u00e0 celle qui se trouve \u00e0\nSfJMio\u00e7 (du dictionnaire grec-fran\u00e7ais). Il faudrait donc sup\nposer, ce qui est absurde, que ce th\u00e8me grec a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec\nun dictionnaire qui sert \u00e0 des versions, et qui ne peut \u00eatre\nutile qu'\u00e0 une personne sachant d\u00e9j\u00e0 le grec.\nPour toutes ces raisons d'ordre , technique, qui sont - d\u00e9cisives,\net qui, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, ont tout autant de force que les raisons\nd'ordre moral, je consid\u00e8re l'hypoth\u00e8se d'une fraude, savante,\ncompliqu\u00e9e, prolong\u00e9e, impliquant l'achat, la possession et la\nm\u00e9ditation \u00e0 diverses reprises, pendant pr\u00e8s de six ans, du\nlivre de Byzantios, comme ridiculement absurde.\nL'absurdit\u00e9 devient plus \u00e9clatante encore, si. l'on songe que\nl'emploi du dictionnaire de Byzantios ne suffirait pas. Il\n\f184 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nfaudrait y joindre Platon, avec l'Apologie de Socrate et le\nPh\u00e8dre. On verra \u00e0 l'appendice qu'il faudrait aussi supposer\nle Nouveau Testament. Du moment que l'hypoth\u00e8se d'une\nfraude serait admise, on ne voit pas pourquoi Mme X. se serait\narr\u00eat\u00e9e en chemin. Si sa m\u00e9moire est aussi extraordinaire,\nelle e\u00fbt pu chaque jour me donner des citations des auteurs\nles plus divers. Et il n'y a rien eu pendant quatre ans.\nQue l'on nie permette ici une courte digression.\nTrop souvent, lorsque l'on est en pr\u00e9sence de faits qu'on\nne peut pas expliquer, on est tent\u00e9 de les r\u00e9soudre par un\nsimple soup\u00e7on que rien ne vient appuyer. Quelle que soit\nl'honorabilit\u00e9 des personnes en jeu, on n'en tient plus aucun\ncompte. On r\u00e9sout tout d'un mot bref, qui explique sans\ncommentaires et sans preuves. On oublie que, si la mauvaise\nfoi est facile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, il est impossible de prouver la bonne\nfoi. Je ne sais plus qui disait jadis: \"Si l'on m'accusait d'avoir\nmis dans ma poche les tours de Notre-Dame de Paris, je\ncommencerais par me mettre \u00e0 l'abri des poursuites.\" En\nr\u00e9alit\u00e9, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, l'hypoth\u00e8se d'une fraude est tout aussi\nabsurde que celle du vol des tours de Notre-Dame. Et il n'y\na d'autre raison pour croire \u00e0 la supercherie que l'impossibilit\u00e9\nd'admettre un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne que nous ne comprenons pas ! Comme\nsi nous comprenions tout ce qui est dans la Nature !

Car cette\nhypoth\u00e8se suppose que le livre en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 vu en passant,\npour ainsi dire, pour quelques instants seulement, puisqu'il a\n\u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9, et que ce souvenir s'est grav\u00e9 dans la m\u00e9moire\n\fLi.] X\u00e9noglossie. 185\ninconsciente (le subliminal self) sans que la personnalit\u00e9 con\nsciente, r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie, en ait connaissance.\nDe tels exemples ne sont pas rares, et dans l'\u00e9tude de\nl'hypnotisme, on en a signal\u00e9 de remarquables. Mais nous\nne croyons pas qu'il puisse en \u00eatre question ici pour diverses\nraisons.\nJe ferai remarquer d'abord que, lorsque Mme X. donnait les\n\u00e9critures en question, elle n'\u00e9tait nullement en \u00e9tat d'hypnose.\nA.u d\u00e9but, dans les premi\u00e8res exp\u00e9riences, il y a eu transe v\u00e9ri\ntable; mais peu \u00e0 peu les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes se sont produits sans\naucune transe, avec la conservation compl\u00e8te de la personnalit\u00e9\nnormale, consciente ; tout au plus un l\u00e9ger vague, une obnu\nbilation passag\u00e8re, que les moindres paroles ext\u00e9rieures dissipaient.\nPeu importe, d'ailleurs ; car il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de sup\nposer l'\u00e9tat d'hypnose, latent ou manifeste, pour qu'il y ait\nmanifestation de la m\u00e9moire inconsciente.\nLa difficult\u00e9 r\u00e9side uniquement dans l'extension prodigieuse,\ninou\u00efe, invraisemblable, qui serait alors donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire\nhumaine.\nSupposons que Mme X. ait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9talage d'un bouquiniste ou\nailleurs, observ\u00e9 et feuillet\u00e9 le livre de Byzantios, ce n'est pas\nimpossible, assur\u00e9ment, quoique peu probable. Mais ce qui\nest impossible, c'est qu'elle ait inconsciemment lu au moins\ncent pages de ce livre grec, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 avoir eu sous les\nyeux au moins une fois des phrases s'appliquant aux situa\ntions diverses o\u00f9 elle devait se trouver; car elle a \u00e9crit cette\nphrase qui r\u00e9pond exactement \u00e0 la question que je posais:\nto \u00e0vTlypa<pov, etc. . . La copie est conforme \u00e0 l'original. Il\nest absurde d'admettre qu'en ouvrant le livre elle a eu juste\nment sous les yeux cette phrase pour se souvenir en temps\nopportun et de la signification fran\u00e7aise, et de la forme typogra\nphique grecque correspondante. M\u00eame cela ne suffit nullement,\ncar elle a encore vu bien d'autres phrases, dont elle aurait\ninconsciemment retenu le sens, apr\u00e8s en avoir lu les caract\u00e8res.\nPourquoi aurait-elle dit : \" Je ne sais plus l'anglais,\" en m\u00eame\ntemps qu'elle \u00e9crivait ; A\u00e9v y\u00c7\u00e9upco 'AyyXuc\u00e2, et fredonnait-elle :\nSouvenez-vov\u00c2-en, en \u00e9crivant evduwo-ou to ? Cela supposerait\ncette \u00e9norme absurdit\u00e9 qu'elle avait parcouru toiU le dictionnaire\n(dans l'\u00e9tat d'inconscience), et qu'elle en avait retenu assez de\nphrases pour pouvoir les appliquer aux diverses conditions en\n\f186 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nlesquelles elle allait se trouver. (Les pages, en effet, o\u00f9 se\ntrouvent les notes cit\u00e9es sont multiples : pages a et e de la\npr\u00e9face; pages 181, 139, 310, 246, 341, 313, 307, 113, 149.\nCela suppose au moins onze pages lues.)\nOn peut, \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame rigueur, admettre qu'une lecture super\nficielle, conserv\u00e9e par la m\u00e9moire inconsciente, porte sur une\nphrase ou deux, n'ayant pas de sens directement applicable\naux conditions pr\u00e9sentes. Mais qu'il y ait ainsi plusieurs\nphrases toutes tr\u00e8s coh\u00e9rentes, cela est vraiment absolument\nimpossible, et le fait de feuilleter un livre ne donne pas ces\nsouvenirs pr\u00e9cis et multipli\u00e9s.\nLes consid\u00e9rations relatives \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e doivent aussi entrer\nen jeu. Car, d'une part, d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mmo X.,\nsi elle a eu l'occasion, tr\u00e8s rare, et certainement accidentelle,\nde feuilleter, en passant, de vieux livres, \u00e7'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9poque\nrelativement lointaine; c'est-\u00e0-dire, seulement en 1899; et,\ndepuis cette \u00e9poque, elle n'a certainement pas eu l'occasion\nd'avoir sous les yeux un livre grec quelconque.\nD'ailleurs, d\u00e9j\u00e0 en juin 1900, se trouvait une phrase identique\n\u00e0 celle qui est dans le dictionnaire de Byzantios (vi), et pro\nbablement m\u00eame le mot Sureyyevo\u00e7 donn\u00e9 en novembre 1899,\nmot qui n'appartient pas au grec ancien, mais au grec moderne,\nindique que d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, il y avait une relation entre le\ndictionnaire de Byzantios et l'\u00e9criture grecque de Mme X. De\nsorte que, m\u00eame en supposant, ce qui nous para\u00eet inadmissible,\nla m\u00e9moire inconsciente, il faudrait lui attribuer ce privil\u00e8ge\ninou\u00ef, de persister pendant cinq ans sans aucune alt\u00e9ration,\navec la reproduction graphique textuelle de tous les signes,\nincompr\u00e9hensibles, mais persistant dans la m\u00e9moire.\nEnfin, la difficult\u00e9 n'est pas moindre \u00e0 supposer cette pro\ndigieuse aptitude (inconnue jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent) de la m\u00e9moire \u00e0\nretenir les moindres signes graphiques. Quelque cr\u00e9dit qu'on\naccorde \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire inconsciente, quoique l'on pr\u00e9tende en\nfaire une divinit\u00e9 souveraine qui peut tout, ce n'est pas une\nexplication rationnelle. Nous avons refus\u00e9 tout \u00e0 l'heure \u00e0 la\nm\u00e9moire consciente, r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie, un pareil pouvoir, ce n'est pas\npour en doter la m\u00e9moire inconsciente, non r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie, non voulue,\ncapable de beaucoup, mais incapable de fixer tous les d\u00e9tails\nd'un tableau aussi complexe qu'une page de grec, quand chacun\ndes signes trac\u00e9s est vide de sens, et que la langue est ignor\u00e9e.\n\fLi.] X\u00e9noglosaie. 187\nEn outre, l'objection que je faisais plus haut, objection\nfondamentale, d'extr\u00eame importance, qui est l'impossibilit\u00e9, pour\ncelui qui ne connait pas le latin, de comprendre la phrase de\nCic\u00e9ron : Graecis licet utare, cum voles, si te latinae forte depciant,\nsubsiste tout enti\u00e8re, aussi bien pour la m\u00e9moire inconsciente\nque pour la m\u00e9moire r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie.\nNous pouvons donc r\u00e9solument conclure que le fait d'\u00e9crire\nainsi, avec une exactitude graphique presque parfaite, de longues\nphrases grecques, alors qu'on ignore le grec, est, dans l'\u00e9tat\nactuel de la psychologie, absolument inexplicable, et que c'est\nune tentative d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e, pour \u00e9chapper \u00e0 l'inexplicable, que de\nse r\u00e9fugier dans l'hypoth\u00e8se d'une m\u00e9moire prodigieuse.\nCar jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, en fait de m\u00e9moire, on n'a jamais rien\nvu d'analogue. Quand les calculateurs prodiges d\u00e9roulent au\nbout d'un quart d'heure les nombreuses s\u00e9ries de chiffres qu'on\na \u00e9nonc\u00e9s devant eux, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 ils parlent une langue sp\u00e9ciale,\nqui leur est famili\u00e8re, et auquel un long usage, servi par un\nextraordinaire appareil c\u00e9r\u00e9bral, les a pli\u00e9s. Quand un musicien\nretient toutes les parties d'orchestre d'une partition, il s'agit\nencore d'une langue qu'il conna\u00eet bien. Mais ici rien de sem\nblable : ce sont des signes, et rien que des signes, qui sont\nreproduits avec leur d\u00e9licate ponctuation dans leurs moindres\nd\u00e9tails, et qui sont symboles d'une langue absolument incomprise.\nPourtant le fait existe. Il est indiscutable, aussi brutal\nqu'un fait, et nul ne peut le nier. Il ne s'explique pas par\nla m\u00e9moire. Nous venons de le prouver.\n(3) Les deux hypoth\u00e8ses pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9es\nabsurdes, il est permis de recourir \u00e0 une hypoth\u00e8se autre. Mais\nnous allons voir que l'hypoth\u00e8se des esprits n'est pas davantage\nrecevable.\nEn effet, ce que nous savons ou croyons savoir sur la\nr\u00e9alit\u00e9 des esprits et sur leur puissance est tellement vague,\nqu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la supposition qu'il s'agit d'esprits revient \u00e0\naffirmer notre non-connaissance des choses. Les esprits sont\ndes IHi ex machina faciles \u00e0 inventer pour suppl\u00e9er \u00e0 une\nexplication. Expliquer un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne incompris par des ph\u00e9no\nm\u00e8nes plus incompr\u00e9hensibles encore, c'est d'une logique tr\u00e8s\ncontestable ; de m\u00eame que les sauvages expliquent la gr\u00eale,\nla pluie et les \u00e9clairs par l'action des g\u00e9nies et des diables,\nde m\u00eame les spirites expliquent ce qui d\u00e9passe nos connaissances\n\f188 Professor Charles RichA.

Dans\nce cas, la personnalit\u00e9 qui serait revenue serait probablement,\npuisque la signature A. A. R. a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, Antoine Augustin\nRenouard. Mais cette supposition soul\u00e8ve maintes difficult\u00e9s.\nD'abord, Antoine Augustin Renouard n'\u00e9tait pas, \u00e0 propre\nment parler, un hell\u00e9niste. Il \u00e9tait imprimeur et bibliophile ;\nil a imprim\u00e9 Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 ; mais sa connaissance du grec\nn'\u00e9tait pas exceptionnelle, et il ne savait probablement pas le\ngrec moderne. Or le livre en question date de 1846. A.-A. R\nest mort en 1853; et d'ailleurs depuis 1825 il avait com\npl\u00e8tement abandonn\u00e9 l'imprimerie, pour se consacrer exclusive\nment \u00e0 la recherche et au culte des tr\u00e8s vieux livres.\nJe passe volontairement sous silence d'autres indications d'un\nautre genre, qui sembleraient faire croire qu'il y a eu inter\nvention r\u00e9elle de A.-A. R., car il ne faut pas m\u00e9langer \u00e0 cette\n\u00e9tude sp\u00e9ciale, envisag\u00e9e au point de vue de la connaissance\ndes langues \u00e9trang\u00e8res, les autres communications re\u00e7ues, n\u00e9cessi\ntant, elles aussi, pour \u00eatre analys\u00e9es, une longue et laborieuse\ndiscussion.\nOn remarquera aussi que A.-A. R. a sign\u00e9 Sio-eyyevo\u00e7, ce\nqui ne veut pas dire arri\u00e8re-grand-p\u00e8re mais arri\u00e8re-petit-fils.\nDans le dictionnaire de Byzantios (dictionnaire fran\u00e7ais-grec),\nil n'y a rien \u00e0 arri\u00e8re-grand-p\u00e8re : il y a ir\u00e2iriro\u00e7 \u00e0 grand-p\u00e8re.\n\u00e0 bisa\u00efeul il y a irp\u00e9irvnnro\u00e7, et Sio-eyyovo\u00e7 (non Sureyyevoc)\n\u00e0 arri\u00e8re-petit-fils.\nSi les preuves sont faibles, ou pour mieux dire nulles, en\nfaveur de l'hypoth\u00e8se qu'il s'agit de la personnalit\u00e9 survivante\nd'A.-A. R., elles sont naturellement plus faibles encore pour\nl'hypoth\u00e8se de l'intervention d'une autre personnalit\u00e9 quelconque,\net il est inutile de s'y appesantir.\nReste encore, il est vrai, le recours \u00e0 une sorte d'hypoth\u00e8se\nmixte, dans laquelle il y aurait eu d'une part m\u00e9moire incon\nsciente, d'autre part emploi, par une intelligence \u00e9trang\u00e8re, de\nces signes laiss\u00e9s dans la m\u00e9moire subliminale.

Ce serait une grave erreur que de\nvouloir a toute force donner aux faits qu'on ne comprend pas\nune explication rationnelle. Les faits qui, dans 1'immense\nNature, depassent notre intelligence sont plus nombreux que\nles autres. Avant qu'on eut connu le mouvement des astres,\npouvait-on comprendre les e\"clipses ?

X.\nis to be thought of as one who distinctly possesses the usual,\nor perhaps unusual, occult powers ; that is to say, the fact\nof automatic writing, or of crystal vision, or other modes of f\nautomatism and response to suggestion, however that suggestion\noriginates, may be regarded as the expected in her case.\nOne of the most striking proofs of her possession of definite\npower in this direction is that related by Professor Richet in\nthe Annals of Psychical Science, Vol. I., p. 130, February, 1905,\nunder the heading, \" A Singular Case of Lucidity.\" The episode\nthere related cannot possibly be accounted for by fraud of\nany kind : it must be due either to chance or to lucidity,\nand my impression is that any one who studies it will\nend by deciding that the hypothesis of chance has to be\nrejected. On that occasion however other people were present,\n\f196 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART\nso it is just possible that the lucidity displayed did not\nbelong to Mme. X. But that is rather a forced hypothesis,\nsince a number of instances of ostensibly clairvoyant faculty\non the part of Madame X. when acting alone are known\nto Professor Richet.\nBut because a medium possesses genuine power it does not\nfollow, as we know well, that that power may not occasionally\nbe eked out by something which may legitimately be called\n' fraud,'\u2014though this name is far too general and indiscriminate\nto be usefully applied to all the many gradations of conscious\nor subconscious or unconscious ingenuity, by means of which\nnormal or accustomed processes are made to do duty for the\nunusual and unaccustomed processes which we are desirous of\ninvestigating.\nAccordingly this case of Xenoglossy must be studied in a\nfully critical manner, and the only use that can be made of\nthe medium's known powers is to help towards an explanation\nof the mode in which the phenomenon in question might occur,\nif the fact of the phenomenon is first rigorously established.\nThe admitted existence of some power has one useful consequence,\nin that it enables one to speak of ' visions,' and of ostensible\n' control ' such as that exercised by a secondary personality or\notherwise, without circumlocution or difficulty.\nWith this prelude I will give a short account or summary\nof the occurrences connected with the writings, as testified to\nby Professor Richet ; it being understood that I am only going\nover them for convenience, and that I am not giving evidence\nin the case.\nIt appears that in November, 1899, Mme. X. had a 'vision'\nof a clean-shaven old man who subsequently often appeared\nto her, and who later gave his name as A. A. R., or sometimes\nin full as Antoine Augustin Renouard\u2014the name of Professor\nRichet's maternal great-grandfather\u2014concerning whom parti\nculars will be found in Professor Richet's paper. He seems to\nhave been a more or less learned bibliophile, but not in any\nspecial sense a scholar. With this vision she at once began\nto associate the idea of the Greek language\u2014a vague notion\nwhich interpreted itself in her waking state as a sort of desire\nto learn Greek. She accordingly applied to a lady friend for\nsome elementary Greek text-books, and two second-hand soiled\n\fLI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 197\nschool books were bought and given her. The desire, how\never, seems only to have been momentary, for it appears that\nthe books were not utilised, but were simply stowed away.\nAbout that same time, viz. on November 7th, in the presence\nof Professor Richet and Mr. Piddington (neither of whom\nthen really knew Mme. X.), at an interview arranged for\nby Mr. Myers, she went into a trance and, with her\neyes closed, wrote in pencil her first Greek sentence, which,\nas a matter of fact, consisted of two fairly simple phrases\nrun together. The meaning was obvious, but the source of\nthe two was unknown, (i.)\nLater in the same month, in the presence of Professor\nRichet, Mme. X., again in a state of trance, wrote a Greek\nsentence which means that the name of the control is\nAntoine (or Antonine) Renouard. (ii.)\nIn the same and following month a few other short sen\ntences were written (iii and iv), and in the summer of 1900\na longer one, which was unintelligible at the time, even\nto so ingenious a Greek scholar as Mr. Myers, (v.)\nSome of the phrases, like (vi), are in Modern Greek, and\nthese are usually colloquial, often referring to the control ;\nother phrases are in Classical Greek, and these appear to\ncontain general sentiments or dignified propositions. But in\nboth cases the writing was nearly without accents, and with\nseveral errors such as might be made by an ignorant but\nvery painstaking copyist who had writing given him which\nhe was to imitate without understanding. It seems to me\nprobable, however, that such a copyist, unless extraordinarily\ncareful, would be likely to make more errors than actually\nwere made. To test this I asked my amanuensis, Mr. Briscoe,\nto copy a few lines of Greek from the bottom of page 346\nof Vol. I. of the Annals of Psychical Science. I took the paper\naway before he had finished, so as to give no time for revision,\nthus imitating the circumstance of the automatic writing with\nfair closeness. The errors are few, but they seem to me of\nthe same general character as those in the automatic scripts ;\nand perhaps Mrs. Verrall, to whom I sent this short piece of\nwriting, will include it in her detailed analysis.\nSo far, all the phrases were written by Mme. X. in Professor\nRichet's presence, and no source was known for any of\n\f198 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART\nthem ; that is to say, they all might have been original.\nThose given in June, 1900, had no signature attached to\nthem.\nNothing more is reported until the Spring of 1904, when\na Modern Greek sentence was partly written and partly given\nby raps (vii) ; and, in the Autumn of that same year, very\nlong and complicated paragraphs in Modern Greek were\nwritten by Mme. X. in Paris, and sent to Professor Richet\nat Carqueiranne, with a letter accompanying them saying :\n\" I have seen nothing but Greek, and Greek, and finally\nmy hand had to write this nonsense which I send you\nbefore I could set about my work. My hand was in a state\nof amnesia [meaning anaesthesia] for a long time afterwards.\n... I hope now to be all right again. . . . How absurd !\nMy hand seems to play me false again. You have no idea\nhow curious this sensation is ; I struggle against something as\nthough in a dream ; everything seems far away. ... I do\nnot know who will win.\"\nThese paragraphs (viii), transmitted by post, which it may be\nsupposed were written more at leisure, contain errors of the\nsame kind as those written under supervision, and, what is\nnoteworthy, contain errors in about the same proportion and\nof about the same kind ; but they include accents, which the\nprevious sentences did not. These long and complicated para\ngraphs, which were very difficult to translate, happened to put\nProfessor Richet on the right scent as to source, in a manner\nwhich he describes in his paper. Briefly thus :\u2014A quotation\nin Littre\"'s French Dictionary indicated that the meaning of\none of these sentences occurred in Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's\nbook Paul et Virginie. It looked therefore as if it were taken\nfrom a Modern Greek translation of this book, but no such trans\nlation was known ; so Professor Richet wrote to Dr. Vlavianos,\nof Athens, asking him if there were such a thing, at the same\ntime explaining the reason of the request by sending the Greek\nsentences. Dr. Vlavianos replied in the negative, but said that\nhe had found the sentences in the Preface to a dictionary,\nihed about 60 years ago, for use by Greek students\ning French. It appears that in this Preface the author\nTitios), anxious to demonstrate the adaptability of Modern\nproceeded to translate some complicated descriptive out\n\fLI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 199\nof-the-way French into his own language. In accordance with\nthis plan he chose sentences from Paul et Virginie and from\nEugene Sue's Mystbres de Paris. These are the sentences which,\nwith a few alterations, such as putting FuXXia instead of\n'EXAay, were written by the automatist. This dictionary, we\nare told by Prof. Richet, exists in the National Library of Paris ;\nand the leaves of its Greek-French portion are cut.\nIn April Professor Richet informed Mme. X. of his\ndiscovery, but did not show her the book. On May 2nd he\nwent to see her and told her of his intention to take the\nByzantios Dictionary with him when he went to London to\nread his paper to the S.P.R. While he was telling her this,\nshe began to go into a trance again, said she \" felt unable to\nspeak English, and saw Greek characters all around \" ; then\nin a state of semi-consciousness she took up a pen and,\nstanding beside him, wrote a long Greek phrase in a blank\nnote-book, writing it slowly as if she were copying something\nheld up in front of her eyes, while in reality she was looking\ninto space, and writing slowly and painfully. This paragraph,\nso written, contains the same kind of errors as before\u2014\npractically no more and no less\u2014it exhibits complete ignorance\nof the language on the part of the writer ; and it also was\nfound in the Preface to the same dictionary, being in fact\nthe commencement of a quotation from Eugene Sue, a later\nportion of which had already been given, (ix.)\nProfessor Richet then asked her thus semi-entranced to give\nan explanation of the paragraph written; this she did not do,1\nbut wrote instead in Modern Greek, the following sentences\n<x-xv) :\n\" Just at present I do not know English.\"\n\" The copy agrees with the original.\"\n\" I have my instructions from which it is impossible for\nme to depart.\"\n\"These notes will make the volume still larger.\"\u2014A. A. B.\nAnd, a little later, she further wrote in modern Greek :\n\" This war interests the whole of Europe,\"\n[they had been mentioning the Russo-Japanese war] and\n1 In Byzantios' Dictionary, the translation is opposite the text, so that, had\nshe got the thing up, Mme. X. could have answered his question.\n\f200 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART\n\" Souvenez-vous en,\"\n[a song she had been humming].\nBut the strange thing is that all these phrases, too, are to\nbe found in the Greek-French Dictionary, scattered about at\ndifferent places ; not in the Preface, but as specimen phrases\nillustrative of certain words. In these latter cases of writing\nmany of the accents were inserted : in fact nearly all of them.\nThe errors are few, but again they are those of a very careful\nand competent copyist who did not know the language.\nA few days later, Professor Richet came to London and\ngave to the S.P.R. an address on these phenomena, the\nsubstance of which appears in the preceding paper.\nThe meeting in London was on May llth, and after Pro\nfessor Bichet's return to Paris, while he was writing his article\non the subject, viz. on May 26th, Mme. X., with whom he\nwas at the moment discussing the matter, went into semi-\ntrance again, and once more wrote a quantity of Greek,\nwriting as before with difficulty, and exactly as if she were\ntrying to decipher something held up before her eyes in\nspace. (See Appendix to Prof. Richet's paper.) This was\nneither Classical nor Modern Greek, but proved to be a\ncollection of extracts from the Gospel of St. John, concluding\nwith the text, \" But now I go my way to him that sent\nme.\" These extracts were supplemented by a few sentences\nin Modern Greek which mean :\n\"I can do no more.\"\n\" Have finished work.\"\n\"The End.\"\nThis writing is signed \" Byzantios A. A. 11.\"\u2014that is to\nsay, it is signed with the old signature A. A. B,, as many\ntimes previously, but with the word \" Byzantios \" prefixed,\nByzantios being the name of the author of the now known\nGreek-French Dictionary.\nThis new signature indicates that the automatist accepted\nthe now recognised source of the majority of the quotations.\nSince then no more of this phenomenon has occurred. But\nin June, 1905, Mr. Shipley, who had become interested in\nthe case, set himself to ascertain the sources of the Classical\nGreek also. He found that each part of the double sentence\n\fu.] D-iscussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 201\nfirst written (i) occurred in separate passages of Plato's \" Apology,\"\nthe second half being a not inappropriate farewell sentence.\nThe next and more unintelligible classical phrase (ii) he found\n(without the errors and verbal repetitions of course) in the\n\"Phaedrus,\" though, as it is not of a simple character, the\nmistakes made by the copyist had rendered it unintelligible,\nso that for all these years it had been considered only gib\nberish. The concluding word of this writing is not in the\n\" Phaedrus,\" but is a Modern Greek salutation apparently added\nas an adieu.\nFor a full discussion of the whole matter, and especially\nfor the kind of explanations that may or may not be reasonably\nsuggested, readers must study Professor Richet's paper ; and\nlikewise Mrs. Verral1's future comments thereon, which I am\ntold she is preparing.\nIn writing the above I have not seen this paper of Mrs.\nVerral1's, because I thought it best to make my statement\nindependently. The explanation, in so far as it can be\ncalled an explanation, which seems to me the only feasible\nhypothesis, short of conscious and deliberate deception, is that\nthe entranced or semi-entranced medium sees in a vision certain\nwriting which she proceeds to copy; being influenced thereto\nby some control, the nature of which is unknown to me.\nThe fact that the writing thus produced already exists in\ntype is of course an extremely suspicious circumstance, but if for\na moment we may make a rather wild hypothesis and assume\nan intelligent control distinct from the medium's normal intelli\ngence, who wished to give, as a test-phenomenon, something\nmarkedly attractive and attention-compelling\u2014who wished to\ngive, in fact, a foreign language which he himself knew, but\nwhich the medium did not know\u2014I ask myself, and I ask the\nreader, to consider how either of us, placed in these imaginary\ncircumstances, would proceed.\nWhen it is a case of conveying ideas, by some process\nwhich we call telepathic, the ideas themselves must be thoiuIht,\nand in some approximately corresponding form can perhaps\nthen be reproduced by the medium ; but if it were our object\nto convey a foreign language, this method would be useless :\nthe ideas would merely reproduce themselves in a language\nknown to the medium. Consider therefore what method is\n\f202 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART\navailable for the purpose. One plan would be to get somebody\npresent to call over the foreign alphabet, letter by letter, and\nthen by some means to give a signal at the right letter. This\nis a well-known tedious process, which on one occasion, in\nconnection with script No. vii, seems to have been actually\nmade use of in this case. How else could a foreign language\nbe conveyed ? By speaking it slowly and distinctly ? That\nwould do, if the medium were intended or disposed to give\nverbal utterance to what we said. But by hypothesis she is\nan automatic writer, and has to write it down, not speak it.\nWhat must we do then ? What could possibly be done except\nhold up a text, either to her physical or to her mental eyes,\nand constrain her to copy it letter by letter ? In other words,\nwe should have to influence her subconsciousness in the same\nsort of way as the subconsciousness of a crystal gazer is influ\nenced, one letter or one word being displayed or called up at\na time. Why it should be easier thus to convey an impression\nof words when the said words are already actually written or\nprinted is not in the least clear to me ; but our experience in\nan increasing number of cases tends to show that it is so, and\nthat the fact of a document being in the neighbourhood of a\nclairvoyant renders the perception of the meaning contained in\nthat document an easier matter than it otherwise would be\u2014\na circumstance manifestly inconvenient from the point of view\nof trustworthy evidence, and open to sinister interpretation. So\nif we further asked what text we should employ, it would not\nbe surprising if the- answer had to be, something already written\nor in type. I see no other way of getting anything to copy\nunless the control had the power of direct writing first. As\na text, the New Testament would naturally occur to one, but\nit might be rejected in the first instance as too obvious and\neasily accessible. Some classical author would next occur ; not\nperhaps the too well known Republic, but some dialogue of\nPlato might very likely suggest itself. A still better choice,\nhowever, would be to employ some out-of-the-way book, such\nas could hardly be accessible ; and if the text thus selected\nwere of an extraordinary and out-of-the-way kind, only\nintelligible with considerable difficulty, and the source of it\nt likely to be detected until after the lapse of a year or\n, it would seem to us, I think\u2014at any rate I think it\n\fLI.] Discussion of Professor Ricket's Case of Xenoglossy. 203\nmight easily seem to me, under those hypothetical and out\nlandish conditions\u2014to be an extra good proof of supernormal\noccurrence\nIn this way I have endeavoured to give to the ostensible\nand superficial appearance of the phenomenon the most favour\nable chance of consideration possible, because it is eminently\ndesirable to look at the matter from all sides, if a supernormal\nhypothesis is to be tentatively admitted at all. A working\nhypothesis of this sort seems to me the only one which satisfies\nthe demand for a rational grasp of what occurred, short of\ncheating. Admittedly the circumstances would seem puzzling\nwhen the sources of the original text was discovered, and the\ncritics of the writing would go through much the same sort\nof self-questioning and doubt of the medium's honesty as\nthey are going through now in this particular instance. Still\nI think it must be regarded as not an impossible thing to\nhappen, given the possibility of anything akin to crystal-vision\npictures in the form of letters and words, which indeed we\nknow to occur ; and for myself I am not disposed altogether\nto scoff even at the idea of some action or activity on the\npart of some intelligence, calling himself A.A.R.\u2014a personality\nanalogous to that of \" Phinuit,\" for instance,\u2014for I gather that\nthis personality has incidentally endeavoured to give proof of\nidentity to Professor Richet, and has succeeded in showing such\nknowledge of family affairs as would to some more credulous\npersons constitute a substantial proof of identity. But Professor\nRichet is not convinced, and he is the best judge concerning\nA.A.I.*. All that, however, is not a matter on which I wish\nto express an opinion ; for one thing I have not the data\nbefore me. Nor do I see that it much matters for the present\nproblem. All that I claim is that the ostensible and apparent\nexplanation of the phenomenon as due to an intelligent control\n\u2014subliminal or other\u2014is not absurd, on our present knowledge,\nbut on the whole is the only reasonable explanation that can\nbe offered, provided deliberate fraud be considered out of the\nquestion. On the whole I am inclined to reject the hypothesis\nof fraudulent knowledge of Greek, coupled with considerable\nmemory, and the still more difficult hypothesis of abnormal\nmemory of form alone without any knowledge of substance.\nUndoubtedly the normal hypothesis of the fraudulent cultiva-\n\f204 Sir Oliver Lodge.

I am sending the result of these experi\nments, as so far conducted, to Mrs. Verrall, who will, I hope,\nrefer to them in her report. But in spite of these interesting\nexperiments, I doubt if the script of Madame X. represents a\ncase of memory at all ; it seems to me more like a case of\ncopying\u2014of copying something either actually before her, which\nProfessor Richet's evidence appears to negative, or else of type\nmentally seen in a manner something analogous to a crystal\nvision\u2014 where the thing seen is vivid enough to be drawn\nor written down, without necessarily any understanding at\nthe time.\n\fLI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 205\nII.\nBY MRS.

By the\nkindness of Professor Richet and Madame X., I have been able\nto see the greater part of the original automatic writings, and\nthe copy of the second edition of the Dictionary of Byzantios,\nwhich, as the reader will remember, contains many of the\npassages given in the script. I have made a detailed ex-\n\u2022Mnination of the automatic writing, including the mistakes\n\fLI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 21 1\nwhich occur in it. Headers unfamiliar with Greek, and un\nacquainted with the original script, may be helped towards a\nsolution of the problem set to us by our President, by reading\nthe observations and comments of one who has some experi\nence both of Greek texts and of automatic writing.\nI have in this paper confined myself to the consideration\nof what conclusions, if any, may be drawn from an examination\nof the writings themselves, and a comparison between them\nand the printed matter which is their undisputed source ; that\nis, I have endeavoured to form an opinion on the internal\nevidence alone, disregarding all external reasons for attaching\nvalue to the documents, and proceeding as though the script\nand the printed matter which it reproduces had been deposited,\nlike a foundling on the doorstep, with no claim to attention\nbut what it could itself convey. Professor Richet, a knowledge\nof whose paper is pre-supposed on the part of my readers, has\nexplained the conditions under which the writing was obtained,\nand the steps by which many of the passages in the script\nwere traced to their original source. The copy of the\nDictionary of Byzantios sent to him from Athens and seen\nby me is of the second edition1; a copy of the first\nedition is in the Bibliotheque Natiouale in Paris. The Dic\ntionary consists of two parts ; in the Greek-French, after\neach Greek word (printed in capital letters) is given the\nFrench equivalent, followed by a selection of phrases (in small\nGreek letters) and their translations ; the French-Greek part\nconsists of a vocabulary only, with no phrases. The phrases\nintroduced into the script from the Dictionary come from the\nGreek-French part, except in one case2 where the script\ngives consecutively two equivalent Greek expressions which\nonly appear in juxtaposition in the French-Greek part of the\nDictionary. Professor Richet has pointed out that where the\neditions differ it is the first and not the second edition of\nthe work that is followed by the script. He informs us that\nin the copy of the first edition in the Paris Library the leaves\nof the French-Greek part are uncut.\nIt will -be necessary, at the risk of wearying the reader\nwith minutiae, to begin with a detailed commentary on the\nactual writings. These consist, as shown above, of a series of\n1See however note at the end of the paper. 2See p. 235.\n\f212 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.

The number of words\nin the earlier writings, not at present accessible to me, is 88.\nMy comment on the appearance of the script and its\ntextual errors is confined to the 23 originals which I have\nexamined ; in discussing questions connected with the source\nand appropriateness of the extracts, I have included the\nwhole 31.\nGENERAL REMARKS ON THE SCRIPT; ITS APPEARANCE AND FORM.\nThough there is considerable variety in the general aspect\nof the writings produced at different times, there is, I think,\nno such difference as would lead one, in the absence of evidence\nto the contrary, to suppose them to be the work of different\nwriters. Certain letters (a, e, r and others) are formed in\nthe same way throughout the script.\nThe chief differences among the pieces are as follows :\nviii A appears to have been written with rather less\nhesitation than the rest of the script ;\nviiiB is remarkably deficient in accents and breathings,\nand some of its letters are slightly decorative in character ;\nviii D is the most cultivated hand ; very few accents or\nbreathings are omitted ;\nAppendix, 1-12, has a different K, and is perhaps slightly\nmore fluent than the scripts viii B and ix to xiv.

The mistakes,\nas in the script, are mainly of the usual type of copyist's error,\nand correctness of accentuation is present here as in the script.\nBut there is a marked indication here of growing familiarity\nwith the appearance of the original, a feature which is con\nspicuously absent in the script. It is here shown in two\nways :\n(1) In the passage copied the small e occurs six times; in\nMr. Briscoe's copy on the first five occasions it is written e, in\nclose resemblance to the letter in the printed original. But\nthe sixth time it appears as \u00a3. , showing that the writer has\nunderstood what the symbol \u20ac stands for,\u2014has, in fact, read it\nas a Greek e, and is reproducing its meaning and not merely\nits appearance.\n(2) A careful examination shows that the letters v and v,\nnot distinguished at first, are gradually differentiated by the\nwriter.

The four divisions of viiiA-D were thus sent\nto him, while the other writings were produced in his presence.\nThe writing in his presence (henceforth called P), which\nI have examined, consists of the passages ix-xiv and 1-12;\nthe other (called NP) of viii A-D. The number of words in\nNP stands to the number of words in P in the ratio of 17 to\n20, i.e. NP has 85 to every 100 words of p.\nLeaving out of account for the present the question of the\ninsertion of breathings and accents, and confining ourselves\nto the mistakes enumerated in the preceding list, we see that\nof the total of 37, II1 are in NP and 262 in P, that is, allowing\nfor the difference in length between P and NP, there are nearly\ntwice the number of mistakes in what was produced in Professor\nRichet's presence as in what was not seen by him till after\nits production.3 This is a remarkable fact, and not without\nsuggestiveness. But other facts must be noted before we can\nform a judgment. In the first place, the comparative absence\nof mistakes in NP ia mainly due to the excellence of one\npassage (D), which presents (see p. 212) a much more scholarly\nappearance than any other passage, and contains only 3 mis\ntakes (or possibly 2). Excluding this, the percentage of\nmistakes in NP is 10.4 The comparatively large number of\nmistakes in P, 14'3 per cent., is mainly due to the number\ncontained in ix b ; excluding ix b, the percentage of mistakes\nin p is under 9 per cent. So that, putting aside these two\npassages, viii D with a percentage of 4%3, and ix b with a\n1Of which one is doubtful, No. 9.\n*Of which four are doubtful, Nos. 15, 18, 20, 30.\n3 Percentage of mistakes to words in \" is 14'3 ; in NP 7'4.\n4 The method of estimating frequency of error by the ratio of mistakes to\nwords in a given passage is only a rough one ; the length of the words is an\nimportant element, and there are other considerations overlooked by this\nmethod of comparison.\n\f226 . Mrs. A. W. Verratt. [PART\npercentage of 37, we have about the same proportion of mistakes\nin all the rest of the passages, whether produced in Professor\nBichet's presence or not.\nTwo long passages were produced in Professor Richet's\npresence, on May 2nd, 1905, a passage from the Dictionary\n(ixb), and on May 26th, 1905, some texts from S. John's\nGospel (Appendix 1-9). Comparing these two, we find that\nthe percentage of mistakes to words in the latter is only 6\nper cent., so that in one of the long passages in P the\nnumber of mistakes is below the average of mistakes in NP.\nThe extracts from the Gospel, however, though they contain\nthree times as many words as the faulty passage from the\nDictionary (ix b), produced under similar conditions, would not\nbe cctcris paribm so difficult to commit to memory as that\npassage, for the average length of the words is considerably\nless, and many of the words recur.\nIf now we turn to the question of the insertion of accents\nand breathings in these two groups, P and NP, we find results\nquite unlike those obtained from a comparison of the number\nof mistakes.1 Out of 274 possible accents and breathings in\nT, 214 are inserted in the script, i.e. 78'1 per cent. ; in NP,\nout of a possible total of 195, we have 124, i.e. 63 per cent.,\nso that the reproduction of accents and breathings is decidedly\nmore correct in the case of those writings produced in Professor\nRichet's presence than in that of those sent to him.\nNor is it possible to say that attention drawn to the ques\ntion of the insertion of these symbols is a cause of the correct\nness in the P section. For the percentage in Appendix 1-12,\nproduced after the paper read by Professor Richet, and communi\ncated to Madame X., is no higher than in the rest of section p.\nThe relative deficiency in NP is mainly due to the almost\ncomplete failure in this respect of one of the pieces sent to\nProfessor Richet, viz. : viii B, where out of 42 possible accents\nand breathings only 7 are inserted in the script, i.e. 16'6 per\ncent. In fact, here too, as in the case of the mistakes, we\nseem to have wide differences as to correctness between indi\nvidual passages, but not between the two groups obtained under\n1I am here only dealing with the insertion or omission of these symbols;\nfor errors, see list on p. 222.

If we had no external knowledge as to\nthe conditions of production, and were to attempt a classifica\ntion of the various passages upon internal evidence alone, we\nshould undoubtedly separate viii D from the rest of viii, as\nbeing on the whole the most correct and scholarly production\nof the script in spite of one damning mistake (No. 11); we\nshould also place viiiB among the more illiterate productions,\non account of its lack of accents and breathings and the general\nslovenliness of the writing.\nAs regards the type of mistakes\u2014as distinct from their\nfrequency\u2014I have not been able to discover any differences\nbetween the two sections P and NP. An examination of the\ntype of mistake is, I think, profitable, at least in suggestions,\nbut I have not found in the study of types any reason for\nregarding the division into P and NP as fundamental,\u2014any\nreason, that is, for supposing that the presence of Professor\nRichet seriously affected the nature of the automatic writings.\nI have also carefully examined the script to see if any\nimprovement were traceable in the course of its production.\nBut I have found no such trace. The point is of some im\nportance as bearing on the genuineness of the phenomena. A\nperson, wholly ignorant of Greek and deliberately producing\nthe script, could hardly fail to acquire in the process some\nknowledge not possessed at the beginning, even if it were only\na slightly increased familiarity with the appearance of the\nletters and words, or a dim perception of the intention or at\nleast the possible positions of such marks as accents or\nbreathings. Such increased familiarity might be expected to\nmanifest itself on a minute examination of the script. But I\nhave detected nothing of the sort. Individual pieces of script\nvary as to apparent ease and correctness of production, but I\nfind no indication of general improvement.\nThe above was written before I had the opportunity of\nexamining a piece of Greek copied under known conditions\nas described by Sir Oliver Lodge on p. 197. It will be seen\nthat in the copy of a Greek unintelligible original produced\ndeliberately by Mr. Briscoe there are indications of the increased\nfamiliarity for which I looked, and looked in vain, in Madame\nX.'s script. It is true that I have not seen the first seven\npieces of that script, but the unfamiliarity with Greek letters\n\f228 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nin the earliest which I have examined, viii, is so marked\nthat there is plenty of room to note even an extremely slight\nindication of increasing comprehension of the symbols. There\nis none that I can detect ; the likeness to one another of the\nGreek characters used by the script in the extracts from the\nDictionary J is strong and shows no traceable development\nor modification : the general appearance of the letters in the\nAppendix varies somewhat from that of the letters occurring\nin the extracts from the Dictionary. But that may very\nwell be due to a difference in the character of the type used\nin the printed copy of the New Testament known to Madame X.,\nwhich in all probability differs considerably from that used\nfor the Dictionary of Byzantios.\nCOMMENTS ON MISTAKES.\nI have not attempted a rigorous classification of mistakes, as\nsome may be attributed to more than one cause. But certain\ntypes are to be observed, and I have grouped together such\nas resemble one another. Thus we arrive at the following list :\nA. 1. Confusion of letters, - - 19 instances.\n2. Accidental slips, viz. : - - 7 \u201e\na. Careless writing, 5.\nb. Interchange of signs, 1.\nc. Slip of pen, 1.\n3. Copyist's errors, 2 \u201e\n4. Omissions, 3 ,,\nB.

Confusion of letters, 19 instances, including 12 errors,\nsome recurring.\nThe larger number of mistakes is produced by the substitu\ntion of one letter for another, thus :\na for o thrice ; o for a twice.\na \u201e (r once ; o \u201e cr once.\ne \u201e T once ; T \u201e $ once.\nft \u201e q once ; v \u201e i once.\nv \u201e v twice ; v \u201e v once.\n\u00a3 \u201e \u00a3 once ; X \u00bb * four times.\nThe substitution of % for K (see above, p. 213) may be\ndue to a real confusion in the writer's mind, i.e. to a failure\nto apprehend that Greek has two distinct letters ; or it may\nbe due to the resemblance between the form of the characters\nin the earlier script. In the first case we might infer on the\npart of the writer ignorance of Greek, in the second unfami-\nliarity. But there is hardly enough evidence to warrant any\ninference, as the four cases of error may be mere slips of the\npen.\nWith the exception of the substitution of \/x for r\\ and per\nhaps e for T (but see above, p. 221) the other mistakes\nare of a common enough type, very familiar to proof readers.\nThey are probably visual errors,1 but they are considerably\nmore frequent than would be expected in the writing of a\nperson acquainted with Greek, and suggest that the letters are\nat best unfamiliar to the writer of the script. The sub\nstitution of ju for ri (No. 33) in the word iroo\/erto seems\nimpossible to any one with the least knowledge of the\nlanguage, the combination \/xo- being quite impossible. Nor is\nthe appearance of the letters ft and i\/ alike, but in the\nshortened forms used by the script there is a certain resem\nblance 2 which might lead to confusion in the case of\nthe mechanical reproduction of an original using these forms.\n1 Except T for S, which seems to be auditory.\n2 One represents the other upside down.\n\f280 \u2022 . Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PAST\n2. a, b, c. Slips and accidental errors, 7 instances.\nThese errors have been described above, and need not\ndetain us here; little or nothing can be inferred from them\nas to the writer's knowledge or habit of mind.\n3. Copyist's errors, 2 instances.\nThe mistake (No. 15), if it be a mistake and not merely\na piece of careless writing, by which raria, instead of TCH\/TO,\nfollows the similar word, Swfj.aria, is common enough in Greek\nmanuscripts, and is due to the ' influence of the immediate\ncontext ' which ' has been a fertile source of error in transcrip\ntion.' 1 The juxtaposition of several similar syllables in the open\ning words of ix, oXa TO Scand-Tia ravra, is probably responsible\nfor the three errors numbered 12, 14, and 15, all of which\nbelong to the class described by Sir R. C. Jebb as due to\nthe influence of the immediate context. The similarity of\n-arm and ravra led first (No. 12) to the omission of a\nword ; then in the recommenced transcript (ix b) to the\nsubstitution of r, the wrongly introduced letter in the can\ncelled portion, for S (No. 14), and finally to the reappear\nance of the combination -aria instead of -avra (No. 15).\nFrom this group of errors then we can only infer what we\nmay infer in many similar cases in Greek MSS., namely,\nthat the document is a copy\u2014not an original\u2014and that the\ncopyist is ignorant, or at least for the moment inattentive\nand mechanical. In the case before us this inference does\nnot help much : whether the automatic writing reproduces\npassages in a book never seen by Madame X., or passages\ndeliberately learnt by her, the methods of reproduction must\nbe those of a copyist, and of a copyist at the best unfamiliar\nwith the language of his original document.\n4. Errors of omission, 3 instances 2 (one word ; two letters').\nThe first case (No. 12) has just been discussed; the other\ntwo, Nos. 35 and 37, are of a different type, and suggest a\ndefective text in the original which they reproduce. It is\nnoticeable that in each case the letter omitted is T : the\nword ovofMari, complete, occurs just before the defective ovo\/ua i,\n1See article on \"Textual Criticism,\" by Professor Sir R. C.

That is to say, these omissions point to\na mechanical\u2014and certainly a non-intelligent\u2014reproduction of\nthe original.\nIt would be very interesting, if it were possible, to ex\namine the copy of the New Testament which (see Professor\nRichet's article, p. 193) Madame X. believes her family to\nhave possessed.\nB. Division of errors into Auditory and Visual.\nProfessor Richet (p. 175) gives reasons for thinking that the\nphenomenon in question, whatever its ultimate explanation, is\na visual one. I have examined the mistakes from this point\nof view and come to the same conclusion. Naturally all the\nmistakes cannot be thus classified with certainty. I have\nexcluded all cases of confusion of letters\u2014though in the\nmajority of these the confusion is probably due to visual\nerror\u2014as it is possible that they may be due to slips of the\npen in writing, not to misreading of the prototype. I have\nalso excluded the ' copyist's errors ' discussed above ; errors\nof audition as well as of vision probably contribute to these.\nThere remains one ambiguous case and ten (of which three\nare doubtful) of visual error.\nNo. 31, the ambiguous case, is a possible, though doubtful\ninstance of mishearing of an original. The word Suotyepei is\nused for Sia(pepet, and the first two vowel sounds may have\nbeen misheard. On the other hand, as noted on p. 213, the\nletters \u2022\u2022' and \u00ab are much alike in the script, and the mistake\nof o for a occurs elsewhere (No. 22) as well as that of a\nfor o (No. 29).\nIt is curious, though probably accidental, that the substituted\nprefix Svo (for Sia) is an intelligible combination in Greek ; it\nis possible to see in this error a trace of acquaintance with\nGreek, but if any intelligence, and not pure chance, has gone\nto the production of Svofapet it must be strictly limited, and\ndoes not include a knowledge of the meaning of Svo, two, or\na rudimentary acquaintance with the principles of verb-\ncomposition.\nThe visual errors consist of three doubtful and seven certain\n\f232 Mrs. A.

[PART\ncases: the three doubtful are Nos. 18 and 20, which may be\nslips in writing, but may also be visual confusions between\nsimilar signs (see comment on mistakes), and No. 34, where\na superfluous stroke may represent something seen and incor\nrectly reproduced.\nSome such mechanical reproduction seems to explain\ntwo of the visual errors, Nos. 2 and 10, where marks\noccurring in the Dictionary are reproduced wholly without\ncomprehension in the script. The accuracy with which\nmarks in the Dictionary are reproduced is commented on by\nProfessor Hichet,1 and is evidence, as far as it goes, that\nthe reproduction is absolutely mechanical, and the process a\nvisual one.\nThe other five visual errors, fiiKpa-v, yoXjo-\/ua^y, Sfj.l\\ovs,\nMovo-e^ow, ev irapoSfy, discussed by Professor Richet, have\nbeen commented on above. They are also dealt with below as\nbearing on the knowledge of the Greek language shown in\nthe script.\nC. Inference from errors as to knmoledge or ignorance of\nGreek.\nWe now come to the discussion of such mistakes as give\nany evidence as to knowledge or ignorance of Greek. Only\ntwo 2 of the mistakes show, I think, any acquaintance with\nGreek, and in both cases other explanations are admissible.\nIn No. 31 it is possible that a dim recollection of Suo may\nhave helped to the corruption of Siafyepet ; in No. 15 it is\nconceivable, though in my opinion highly improbable, that the\nmistake, if it be a mistake, of rcma for ravra, is made by a\nperson able to read Greek letters and pronounce the resulting\nword.\nOn the other hand, there are many indications in the mis\ntakes that Greek is wholly unknown to the writer of the\nscript. In No. 29 ra for TO is doubtless a visual error, or a\nslip of the pen, but, as Professor Richet has pointed out, one\nhardly possible to any one with the smallest acquaintance with\nthe language. Ignorance of the laws of accentuation is shown\nby the first mistake (No. 1), where a circumflex is substituted\nfor an acute accent on the antepenultimate syllable. Incident-\nSee pp. 181-2. 2See however below, on mistakes 11, 8, and 28.\n\fLI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 233\nally I may remark that the extraordinary correctness of\naccentuation in the script\u2014only two errors occurring among\nmore than 300 accents given\u2014constitutes in my opinion a\nstrong reason for believing that the script is a purely\nmechanical reproduction of what has been clearly visualised,\nand not in the least understood. Mistakes 2 and 10, where\nunmeaning strokes are reproduced, as well as the accuracy of\nthe punctuation throughout, not forgetting the representation\nof dots marking omissions, inverted commas, a diaeresis, and so\non, confirm this view; this accuracy is to be expected in a\ncopy which is mechanically reproduced, either by a clear\nvisualising memory, or by a person too ignorant of the mean\ning of the document before him to venture to tamper with a\nsingle dot.\nMistakes 11, 16, 17, 27, 33, and possibly 20,1 show gross\nand complete ignorance of Greek ; three of them, -aSs for\n-ovs, Sfj. for oft., and $(p for Sip, are easily explained as visual\nerrors, and another, -n&ia for -jIaw, as a confusion of letters,\nall possible only to a writer ignorant of Greek. No. 11, as\nI have said, is not so simply accounted for, though it shows\nas complete an ignorance as the others. But I fail to see\nhow fjuxpov, which appears in the Dictionary, could be repro\nduced as niKpfrv, unless it passed through the intermediary\nof fuicpov. This it might do in the case of a person know\ning Greek, who would get from the Dictionary passage the\nnotion not of the collection of signs, fjuxpov, but of the group\nof words of which one was the accusative of \/ui\/c\/ooy, that is\nfjuxpov. But here we are in a dilemma, for this person\ncould not possibly be the ignoramus who writes niKpcrv. In\nfact, it seems as if two2 persons, or two personalities, were\nrequired to explain this mistake, X1 who knows enough of\nGreek to reverse this accent and to think of iuuicpov instead of\nthe fJUKpov of the Dictionary, and X2 who is so ignorant as to\nturn fj.inpov into fjuKpcrv\u2014in the very middle, be it noted, of\nthe best written, best accented, and most correct of all the\n1 If the third sign in the substitute for o-jro\/iao-\/p is not an ill-formed op, it is\nan impossible combination a,, due to a visual error.\n9 See p. 221, where a double process is suggested by the second mistake in\nthe word iunlrvira, ; there too there seems to be an X1 who knows, and an X2\nwho doea not know Greek.\n\fMrs. A.

[PART\nextracts\u2014one too where the absence of supervision gave every\nopportunity for use of the Dictionary.\nIt will be noticed that two of the mistakes, Nos. 8 and\n28, are not included in any classification. If the double\ngamma, yy, in the script is a mere slip, as it may be, for\nthe gamma chi, y%, of the actual word (rvyywpricris, no in\nference can be drawn : if it is a reminiscence of the misprint\nin the Dictionary, double gamma chi, yyx> un(ler the head\ning (rvyyvuift.q, it shows that the writer of the script has\nenough acquaintance with Greek to read Greek capitals.\nThe juxtaposition and appropriate position of the two\nwords KoVoy \"ZvyxaiprIa-K suggests that their meaning was\nknown ; if that knowledge was obtained from the French-Greek\npart, confirmation was sought\u2014always supposing that the\ndouble gamma is not a mere slip\u2014in the Greek-French part\nwhere the mis-spelling occurs.\nThe deliberate use of the Dictionary is not in any case\nproved, even if we assume a causal and not accidental con\nnexion between the misprint of the Dictionary and the error\nof the script, as the writer might have obtained his knowledge\nfrom the Greek-French part, if he had seen\u2014normally or\nsupernormally\u2014the note under a-vyyvwuq and had also seen\nthe word KOiTOy with its meaning. In that case this mistake-\ncontributes nothing to the solution of the problem beyond the\nfact that the writer of the script can read Greek capitals,\nas he reproduces in small letters what his prototype prints in\ncapitals, and, therefore, that no absolute ignoramus or purely\nmechanical copyist is at work here; in fact we have X1 and\nnot X2.\nThe other unclassified mistake, No. 28, may be accounted\nfor in two ways ; if the origin of the word given in the\nscript as irepaa-Tiicio is to be found in the Greek-French part\nof the Dictionary, we must admit that the writer of the\nscript :\n(1) reads Greek Capitals ;\n(2) knows enough of the laws of accentuation to alter the\nacute accent on the final syllable to a circumflex, when the\nvowel is lengthened ;\n(3) attempts a modification of the termination to make a\nconstruable phrase.\n\fLI.] Discussion of Professor Jtwhfit's Case of Xenoglossy. 235\nThis is all, I think, extremely improbable; we may take\nit as almost beyond a doubt that the origin of the word is\nto be found in the French-Greek part of the Dictionary,\nwhere under the head Passer, occur in juxtaposition, as\nrenderings of en passant, the phrases ev irapoSw, irepacmKUis.\nThe script reproduces these, with the intervening comma, but\nwith two mistakes, (p for \u00ab in the first word, and omission\nof the final ? in the second. Accepting this explanation of\nthe mistake, we may infer acquaintance with the French-Greek\npart of the Dictionary, but no knowledge of Greek.\nThe reader will observe that I here use the term acquaintance\nand not -use; the case is not precisely like the preceding one,\neven if we accept in both cases the connexion between the\nscript and the French-Greek Dictionary. Here nothing\nfurther is required than a visual reproduction of a phrase out\nof the French-Greek part, exactly of the same type as the\nreproduction of phrases out of the Greek-French part, the\nIntroduction, and the Dedication, or out of S. John's Gospel,\nand a couple of Plato's Dialogues. In fact we learn nothing\nfrom this mistake but the provenience\u2014to use an archaeologist's\nterm\u2014of a passage in the script.\nThe earlier case, No. 8, is quite different ; there, if the\nFrench-Greek Dictionary is to come in at all\u2014a thing I am\nfar from maintaining\u2014it must have been deliberately used,\nfor the purpose of combining the notions of ' Fatigue,' and\n' Excuse.'\nHaving frankly set out this possible evidence for a deliberate\nuse of the Dictionary, in other words for fraud, as an ex\nplanation of the phenomena, I am bound to say that this\nexplanation of mistake No. 8 is an alternative only, and that\npersonally I believe the other alternative more probable,\nnamely, that its origin is to be sought in the Greek-French\npart, where the mis-spelling occurs. It is quite as likely\nthat the word o-vyxwpq(rw should be reproduced from the\npage where it appears under o-yyyvoJ\/ui\/ as from the page\nwhere it is given under its own heading. In both cases,\nwe have to suppose on the part of the writer\u2014or rather a\nwriter\u2014of the script an acquaintance with Greek capitals ; in\nfact we have to postulate the existence of X1 as well as of\nthe mere copyist X2.\n\f236 Mrs. A. W. Verrali. [PART\nFrom a consideration then of the evidence from the actual\ntext of the script, we are led to the apparently inconsistent\nview that both knowledge and ignorance\u2014of an irreconcilable\nkind\u2014are to be found in the writer of the script, in fact\nthat our unknown quantity is double, that there is an X1 who\nknows Greek, and an X2 who is wholly ignorant. There is\nmore evidence for the existence of X2 than of X1, but before\ndealing further with the general problem\u2014which hitherto our\ninvestigation has not simplified\u2014let us see whether any evidence\nin either direction can be obtained from a consideration of\nother points than the text,\u2014from the meaning, for instance, and\nsource of the quotations given in the script. For this purpose\nI shall not confine my criticism to the 23 pieces of which I\nhave examined the originals, but shall include the whole 31\npieces described in Professor Richet's article.\nSOURCES AND APPLICABILITY OF QUOTATIONS IN SCRIPT.\nThe sources of almost every piece have been ascertained,\nand are given by Professor Richet ; but parts of iii and of\nvii have not been traced. No. iii begins with some words,\nnot construable as they stand, though needing but little\ncorrection. The rest of the sentence is less intelligible though\ncertain expressions are clear. The extract runs thus : Ewx>\/ dfos\nev\\oyua Kai rI\\0a KOTO irpoiTK\\q(Tiv TOV KIJLTO TO Sf$oyfj.eva.\nEmendation is dangerous where so little is known of the nature\nof the writing ; I prefer to consider the text as it stands. It\nis not certain that it represents modern Greek ; the words\nwhich it indicates are known to classical Greek\u2014though the\nform q\\Oa is modern and forms of the first three words appear\nin close conjunction in the Dictionary under tvxri, viz. : ei\/x>\/ =\nev\\oyla ; and later ei\/x\u00bb\/ Oeov. The last phrase cannot occur iu\nthe Dictionary, as the ancient verb SOKUI seems to have been\nreplaced by $oKifj.ul\u00a3w, so that the participle SfSoyneva is not\nrecognised there. The phrase Kara TO SeSoyfieva is very\ngood ancient Greek for ' according to the doctrines,' and, at\npresent, I see no reason to alter it, as suggested in Professor\nRichet's article, to SiSofj.eva.\nNo. vii also opens with a sentence not intelligible and not\ntraced to any source : here the form of the sentence suggests\nthat the language is modern Greek, but the phrases used have\n\fLL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 237\nnot been found in Byzantios' Dictionary till we come to the\nlast four words.\nWith these two exceptions, the source of the quotations is\nknown ; the hooks drawn upon are :\nByzantios' Dictionary; at least twenty different places in the\nvocabulary columns, besides the Dedication, and two\nparts of the Introduction.\nPlato, Apology of Socrates, two distinct places.\nPlato, Phaedrus.\nS. John's Gospel, chapters iv, xiv, xv, and xvi.\nSpeaking generally, the selection of passages from the body\nof the Dictionary does not require any knowledge of Greek.\nThe Greek phrases in that book are followed by their French\nequivalents, so that the meaning is at once apparent. The\nlong passages from E. Sue and Bernardin de S. Pierre (Nos.\nviii A, D and ix) likewise demand no knowledge of Greek, as\ntheir meaning is unimportant. But this is not always the\ncase. There are three instances (i and viii A, u,) which seem\nto show some acquaintance with Greek. In viiiu the word\n\"FJXXay (Greece) in the dedication is replaced in the script by\nthe word FaXX\/a (France) ; this requires at least an elementary\nacquaintance with the letters, so that the right substitution\nmay be made.\nA much stronger proof of acquaintance with Greek is in\nmy view to be found in the appropriate use, at the beginning\nof viii A, of the phrase translated from Cicero in the Intro\nduction to the Dictionary, on which Professor llichet dwells\non p. 182. It is to me quite inconceivable that this phrase\nshould occur where it does by chance. Let us recall the\ncircumstances : Professor Richet receives from a lady, who has\nalready produced in his presence short Greek sentences, a\nlong document in Greek. This document begins with the\nremark that in the lack of Latin words Greek words may be\nused, and then goes on to give three long Greek extracts,\nconcluding l with a statement (viii c), that the writer is fatigued\nil have, to avoid confusion, kept to Professor Richet'a numbering of the ex-\ntracto in viii, lint I do not think, nor does he assert, that his numbering\nrepresents the chronological sequence of the script.

The conclusion,\nit is true, could be given by a writer ignorant of Greek who\nhad used the Dictionary, found separately the words for\nWeariness and Pardon, combined them and reproduced them\nwith blunders. But not so the opening words. As Professor\nRichet points out, the Dictionary contains no translation into\nFrench of the phrase about using Greek, which occurs in the\nIntroduction side by side with its Latin original, and I think\nevery one will agree that it takes a considerable knowledge of\nLatin to see the meaning of the quotation from Cicero, ' Graecis\nlicet utare, cum voles, si te latinae forte deficiant.' If our\nwriter knows no Greek, his Latin scholarship at any rate is\ngood. And be it noted that there is no reason to attribute to\nMadame X. a knowledge even of elementary Latin.\nThe appropriateness of the shorter phrases from the Dictionary\nto the circumstances of their production argues intelligence,\nbut not necessarily knowledge of Greek.

Remarks about a war which interests\nEurope, copies resembling their original, notes which will make\na volume larger, and lengthening shadows, could without diffi\nculty find appropriate places in many conversations, and these\nor similar phrases could probably be acquired without much\nlabour by an industrious person with a good visual memory,\neven without a preliminary knowledge of Greek. The use of\nthem shows intelligence, but not knowledge of Greek.\nNor is it necessary to see a proof of knowledge of Greek\nin the introduction of the name of Professor Richet's great\ngrandfather by means of a phrase from the Dictionary (ii) ; it\nis true that the word ovofta, name, would be likely to be a\ngood hunting ground for any one intending to produce a Greek\nspeaking personality, but the blunders both in the name\nAJTCCWI\/Oy\u2014the equivalent not of Antoine but of Antonin\u2014\nand in the two preceding words \/carto-roy oi\/o\/uaro for (cairo\/oy\novofj.aTt are not suggestive of the very slightest acquaintance\nwith the language. It puts no strain upon the laws of chance\nto suppose that the phrase ' un nomme Antoine ' was acci\ndentally noticed and fixed upon as appropriate by the intelli\ngence\u2014of whatever kind\u2014that is responsible for the production\nof the script.\nSo much then for the evidence as to knowledge of Greek\nfrom the contents of the Dictionary. Nothing can be obtained\nfrom an examination of the verses from S. John's Gospel.\nThe division into numbered verses and the resultant facilities,\neven for one who has no Greek, of comparison between the\noriginal and a translation places these extracts in much the\nsame position as the Dictionary phrases ; their selection demands\nintelligence, but not Greek.\nBut the case is different with the extracts from Plato. I\nfind it hard to believe that a comparison between the Greek\ncase is worth noting, however, as it is not a mere visual reproduction of\na printed original, but a combination showing intelligence of the same type\naa in iii (where two nouns, separately entered in the Dictionary, are joined\nby the conjunction ' and ') and iv (where a sentence is made up of three\nwords occurring separately in the Dictionary).\nQ\n\f240 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\ntext and a translation would enable a person who could not\nread Greek to pick out from the long paragraphs of the myth\nof the Phaedrus a single complete sentence intelligible without\nits context and so well suited for enunciation by the mysterious\nand impressive means of automatic writing, as this description\nof the complete initiate (v.). An interlinear word for word\ntranslation alone would make this likely, and I am not ac\nquainted with any such except for a few books of a simple\nkind adapted for the use of beginners. It appears to me\nunlikely that any such edition of the Phaedrus exists in\nFrance. Nor is the sentence likely to form one of a series\nselected for scholastic purposes to illustrate points of syntax or\nidiom.\nThe evidence for acquaintance with Greek obtainable from\npassage No. i is stronger. Here we have two sentences from\nPlato's account of the Defence of Socrates. The first of these,\n' human wisdom is of little worth or none,' is found in the\nninth chapter of the Dialogue, and is the interpretation put\nby Socrates himself on the famous answer of the Delphic\noracle that no one was wiser than Socrates. The second,\n' but now the time has come for departure,' is the opening\nclause of the last sentence of the Dialogue (chap. 33). The\ntwo phrases are not in juxtaposition in the Dialogue, so\nthat no casual glance would have perceived them both. The\nfirst sentence is one that might be used, out of its context,\nto illustrate a point of syntax, or might be quoted in an article\non Socrates.1 But there is nothing distinctive about the second\nsentence, and it is not likely to be quoted anywhere out of\nits context. The conjunction of two disconnected sentences\nout of the same Dialogue and the appropriate use of the\nsecond cannot possibly be fortuitous, and would be natural\nenough to a Greek scholar ; that a person unable to read\nGreek should have hit upon such a combination is to my mind\noutside the range of the most widely ranging Chance. But\nthough we have reason to see the work of X1 in the selection\nof the passages, his collaborator X2 seems also to have done\nhis share ; apa for wpa is an unlikely slip for a reader of\nGreek, and aireivai for a-n-ievai is an elementary blunder.\n1 That Madame X. is interested in Socrates and his ' guide ' is within my\npersonal knowledge.\n\fUL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 241\nSo then from a consideration of the contents of the automatic\nwriting as well as from that of its form, we are led irresistibly\nto the paradox that the writer possesses both knowledge and\nignorance, knowledge and ignorance of an irreconcilable kind.\nFor what we have observed is not the alternate presence and\nabsence of knowledge of Greek, but the simultaneous possession\nof knowledge and non-knowledge of the same thing.\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE ABOVE EXAMINATION.\nThe reader, if any reader has followed me so far through\nthe wearisome technicalities of this examination, will perhaps\nask what is my general conclusion on the whole matter, or\nin a concrete form, who are the X1 and the X2 into whom I\nhave resolved the comparatively comprehensible 'Madame X.' of\nthe original problem.\nTo this question\u2014which I would remind the reader I am\nhere approaching only from the standpoint of internal evidence\nof the script itself\u2014I can give no satisfactory answer ; we\nhave not sufficient information to warrant a conclusion. Such\nevidence as we have suggests this double source, and all we\ncan do at present is to register the evidence, and see what\nlight it throws upon existing theories. Of theories that have\nbeen or may be advanced to explain this case of Xenoglossy\nsome are ruled out by the acceptance of this double source ;\nthe explanation by unconscious memory\u2014that is, the repro\nduction of printed matter seen but not consciously observed\u2014\nmust be rejected, as it fails to account not only for the\nknowledge of Greek, but also for the intelligence shown by the\nwriter ; moreover, as Professor Richet has pointed out, we have\nno other instance of production by unconscious memory of such\na mass as is before us here, nor of matter from such various\nsources.\nFor the spiritistic hypothesis, communication from ' Antoine\nRenouard,' there is at present no evidence before us but the\nunsupported ' ipse dixit ' of the script, and those who are\nacquainted with automatic phenomena will know how much\nweight to attach to that.\nNo theory which does not admit intelligence and knowledge\nof Greek will fit my view of the facts, so that I should not\n\f242 Mrs. A. W. Verratt* [PART\nbe able to accept a hypothesis which gave a large share to\nchance as a cause. Chance might indeed account for some of\nthe successes, for the discovery of the name Antoine, for\ninstance, or perhaps for the finding of an appropriate quotation\nfrom Plato, but not for the finding of three appropriate quota\ntions from Plato, and the combination in one sentence of the\ntwo which come from the same dialogue. Thus a combination\nof Chance, Fraud, and Ignorance of Greek will not, as I believe,\nexplain the phenomena.\nFraud, in certain conditions, would account for the facts ;\nif, for instance, we suppose two persons, X1 and X2, who\ncombine to make a sensational story. X1 has a knowledge of\nGreek, looks out appropriate passages, consults Byzantios'\nDictionary, and passes on his information to X2, who knows\nno Greek ; X2, copying blindly from transcripts (see mistake\nNo. 11) or from marked books, introduces the illiterate\nblunders that are not infrequent. Headers must judge for\nthemselves of the value of other considerations\u2014the ' moral\nproofs ' of which Professor Richet speaks\u2014which make unlikely\nthe hypothesis of fraud on the part of Madame X.\u2014the X2 of\nthe above theory; these considerations necessarily carry more\nweight with Madame X.'s friends and acquaintances than with\nstrangers. Fraud, being an ascertained cause of many pheno\nmena, must always be admitted as a possible, even a probable,\ncause. I would, however, point out that the introduction of\na second person, which I regard as a necessary deduction\nfrom the evidence, more than doubles the risk of discovery,\nand thereby increases the improbability of fraudulent action\nwhere the producer of the fraudulent phenomena has much to\nlose by discovery. I would also point out that on the theory\nof fraudulent collusion between X1 and X2 we must admit that\nX1 uses less intelligence than we might expect. Given an\nintelligent person, who knew Greek, and was deliberately\nworking this business, a much better show might have been\nmade.\nThis, perhaps, suggests that the theory of fraud and the\ndouble origin of the script are best reconciled if we suppose\nX1 to be innocent, supplying material without being aware\nthat he is so doing to X2, who gets books and suggestions\nfrom him. This proceeding is more comprehensible, but hardly\n\fLL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 243\nless dangerous for X2, unless it is certain that X1 will hear\nnothing of the stir made by this strange case of Xenoglossy.\nBut the splitting or doubling of the producer of the script,\nthe division of X into X1 and X2, need not imply fraud. If\nthe phenomena are regarded as genuine, X1 and X2 will be two\nmanifestations or aspects of the producing cause, whatever\nthat producing cause may be. The phenomena, whatever their\norigin, are at least presented to us by the hand of Madame X.,\nwho, on this theory, knows no Greek and who may thus\neasily supply our X2. X1 is then to be found perhaps in her\nSubliminal Consciousness, or in some external force acting upon\nthe Subliminal, or again in some aspect of that Personality\nwhich we are coming to recognise as Multiplex. Is the\ncontrast between our X1 and our X2 stronger than that be\ntween Ansel Bourne and his alias A. J. Brown I1 Does the\nknowledge of Greek mark a difference deeper than is shown\nin the knowledge and practice of an ethical code exhibited\nby Miss Beauchamp and unknown to Sally ?2 Is the power to\nread an unknown tongue more remarkable than the power of\ndrawing possessed by the B 1 0 personality of Dr. Wilson's\npatient,3 Mary Barnes ? These are problems for the psycho\nlogist ; it is the business of us psychical researchers to\ninvestigate such phenomena as bear no prima fade evidence\nof fraud, to examine them in detail, to analyse the results,\nto draw what inferences we may from the facts presented,\nto provide established data for the future construction of\ntheories ; in short, to put a plain label on each particular\npigeon hole of that large receptacle of observed facts which\nit is the chief duty of our Society to keep accessible and\nwell arranged.\nSince writing the above paper, I have been able, through the\nkindness of Professor Richet, to examine a copy of the first\nedition of Byzantios' Dictionary.

When we ask\nwhat the arguments in support of this conclusion amount to,\nthere appear two answers : (1) the apparent good faith of the\nmedium ; (2) internal evidence resting on the characteristics of\nthe script itself, tending to show that it could not have been\nproduced by normal means.\nIn regard to the first, M. Richet's intimate knowledge of the\nlady and the conclusions which he has been led to form from\nit must of course command the greatest respect. Knowledge\nof this kind may be sufficient, and in certain cases is legiti\nmately sufficient, to produce conviction in the mind of him\nwho possesses it. It is in reliance on such kind of knowledge\nthat we all act with completest confidence in matters of\nordinary life, or human intercourse would be impossible. But\nit is clear that in order to establish the nature of pheno\nmena of such an almost unprecedented description as those\ncontained in his paper, evidence of more universal application\nis necessary. M. Richet is, of course, himself the first to admit\nthis, and he therefore adduces a number of arguments tending\n\f246 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART\nto show from the script it.self that agency of some super\nnormal character must have been at work.\nIn this paper we purpose, therefore, first to consider the chief\npoint.s of evidence in turn in order to test their validity. The\ntask is not a grateful one, for we must on our side admit\nthat even should we succeed in meeting most of M. Richet's\narguments, the result will be purely negative, and though it\nmay perhaps be concluded that they are insufficient to establish\nthe supposed supernormal agency, it is equally certain that we\ncannot establish any other.\nThere may, however, be certain considerations which point\nto, though they cannot prove, an alternative conclusion to M.\nRichet's, and it will be the second portion of our task to sum\nup what these amount to, though without intending to commit\nourselves in any way to the opinion that this conclusion is\nthe right one.\nM. Richet's argument may very shortly be summarised and\nits constituent parts numbered as follows. (1) Mme. X., who\nknows no Greek, writes in a shaky hand, which of itself\nsuggests that the writing was executed as if by a copyist,\nignorant of Greek and unaccustomed to write it, a number\nof Greek sentences. While some of these were written in\nhis absence and may therefore have been copied from a\nbook, the bulk were written in his presence. (2) The quantity\nof the latter sentences is so considerable, and their execution\non the whole so accurate, that it is impossible to suppose that\nthey could have been learnt by heart. (3) Further, the mis\ntakes which do occur, both in the sentences written in his\nabsence as well as in those written in his presence, are often\nof such a character that they cannot be accounted for, on\nan assumption of fraud, in any consistent way. (4) And\nagain, inasmuch as the mistakes in the former class of\nsentences, where a text to copy from might be assumed, are\nnot less numerous than those in the latter class, which\nwere certainly written without text, it is reasonable to assume\nthat both were written under the same conditions, i.s.\nwithout text. (5) The fact that the majority of sentences\nare found in an extremely rare dictionary, and in the Greek-\nFrench part of that dictionary, makes it improbable that Mme.\nX. could have had access to the dictionary, or (6) since she\n\fLL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 247\nknew no Greek, could have made any practical use of it if\nshe had. (7) The appropriateness of many of the sentences\nproduced in M. Richet's presence is so remarkable that it\nmost follow that their production was the work of some\nextraneous intelligence. (8) Although it is true that most of\nthe sentences found in the dictionary have French translations\nalongside them, there is at least one of quite especial appro\npriateness (viz. VIII. A. -^p^crdai Xe'^eo-jv, etc.), which has only a\ntranslation in somewhat difficult Latin (also an unknown\nlanguage to Mme. X.) from which fact particularly deliberate\nrational intelligence is to be assumed. (9) Finally, that such\nintelligence is again revealed by the choice of the phrases\nfrom Plato's Apology and Phsedrus and the Gospel of St.\nJohn, which are also stated to be appropriate.\nLet us then take these arguments seriatim, which for the\nsake of brevity we will refer to by their respective numbers.\n(1) Much of M. Richet's paper is devoted to showing that\nMme. X. knows no Greek. We admit at once thnt it is\nclear she knows extremely little. We see, however, no reason\nfor supposing that she has not learnt the letters, a task which\nany ordinarily intelligent student could master in an hour, and\nwhich would enable her, if necessary, to look up words in a\ndictionary and in any case would greatly facilitate the learning\nof passages by heart. This question of ignorance we deal with\nin greater detail when we come to a consideration of point (3).\n(2) Assuming that Mme. X. had learnt the Greek alphabet,\nand was thus able to associate in her mind the approximate\nsound of the words with the printed text, is it possible to learn\na number of sentences by heart, and reproduce them with\nreasonable accuracy afterwards ? We should have thought it was.\nIt must be remembered that Greek, like Latin, is a language\nthe spelling of which is absolutely phonetic. Once the sound\nis mastered, the spelling follows inevitably. It is therefore\nnot in the reproduction, but in the original learning, that the\ndifficulty arises. Is it then possible to learn by heart passages\nwhich mean nothing to the learner ? Prof. Richet maintains\nthat it would be \" materially impossible \" for any one to re\nproduce from memory and with so much accuracy phrases in\na language unknown to him as long as the passages IX. to\nXV., which were written in his presence on a single occasion.\n\f248 Hon. Everard Fettding and Alice Johnson. [PART\nThe longest and most difficult of these passages is IX., which\nconsists of 41 words ; the other six are short and com\nparatively simple, containing 44 words altogether. It would\nno doubt take a good deal of time and trouble to learn as\nmuch of an unknown language as this by heart, but we cannot\nfeel that it is a feat of superhuman difficulty. We would suggest\nas analogous instances a schoolboy who learns, in most cases\nwith hardly the ability to construe them, and certainly without\ntaking the trouble to do so, long passages of Greek or Latin\nverse for punishment tasks ; or the still more appropriate\ncase of entirely uneducated Roman Catholic boys who learn\nby rote, often without the slightest attempt at verbal com\nprehension, long passages of Latin for the purpose of serving\nat Mass or other devotional exercises.\nThere is nothing in the circumstances of Mme. X.'s case to\nprevent the passages having been carefully studied and copied\nout again and again before they were produced in M. Richet's\npresence, for the Dictionary was, as he states in his paper, in\na public library where she is accustomed to read, and there can\nbe no difficulty in finding a Greek New Testament in Paris.\n(3) The points on which we venture to differ from M. Richet\ndepend a good deal on our different conception of the process that\nwould have been employed, supposing there was fraud. Thus as\nto the character of the mistakes, it must be noticed that a person\nignorant of Greek and learning it by heart might do this in two\nways : (a) by a process of mere visualisation, which would no\ndoubt be a very difficult task ; (6) by learning the letters suffi\nciently well to be able to associate sounds with them, and by\nthen learning the passages by sound like a parrot. This, as\nalready suggested, is the more probable and easy method.\nBut it is still more probable that the two methods would\nhave been combined, in which case, while trying to reproduce\na passage so learnt, mistakes due either to faulty visualisation,\nsuch as ^ for w, or 6 for 6, or to faulty audition, such as\nT for S, might creep in.\nFollowing Mrs. Verral1's analysis of the mistakes, we find\nat the outside only nine cases showing such complete and\ngross ignorance as 6 for 6, or 0 for to, out of 372 Greek words.\nThis is a very small number, and after all, what evidence is\nthere that the script writer did not really know better ? If,\n\fLL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 249\nindeed, she had been questioned about inaccurate letters, and\nwas unable to see that they were wrong, this would show real\nignorance; or if she had read over the script carefully and\nhad not found out the mistakes, this would show at least great\ncarelessness. It is surely not necessary to attribute all the\nmistakes specifically either to faulty visualisation or audition.\nIt all depends on whether the mistakes were made, so\nto speak, deliberately, while the conscious attention of the\nwriter was directed towards the letters, or were mere slips.\nWe all know that educated people make extraordinary\nmistakes in writing or even in speaking, which\u2014if we did not\nknow they were slips\u2014we might take as evidence of gross\nignorance. It seems not impossible, then, that these bad mis\ntakes of Mme. X.'s were mere slips, and if so, they do not\nafford evidence of any greater ignorance than the mistakes\nwhich Mrs. Verrall classifies as confusion of letters, accidental\nslips, copyist's errors and omissions.\nThe fact of the second phrase in passage VII. being given\nby raps\u2014instead of in writing, like all the other passages\n(see Prof. Richet's paper, p. 167) seems to involve some know\nledge of the letters on the part of the automatist.\nThis production of some of the sentences by raps is surely\nof considerable importance, if only as tending to show the\nimprobability of Sir Oliver Lodge's theory of the modus\noperandi of the unknown intelligence. It is difficult enough\nto assume that this intelligence or control, if it is attempt\ning to induce visions, can only do so by means of a\nprinted text. But it is going further still to assume that\nit can only rap out sentences alread}7 existing in print. If\nit can rap alphabetically, the natural deduction is that it\nmust be able to rap out original sentences. If it cannot do\nthis, we can only account for its deficiency by another and an\nentirely unfounded hypothesis,\u2014that its knowledge is limited\nto the understanding of written Greek, and is not extensive\nenough to enable it to compose original phrases. But\u2014and\nthis is a point on which we wish to lay special emphasis\u2014the\nappropriate substitution of the word TaXX\/a (France) for *EXXa9\n(Greece) in VIII. B, suggests at least enough familiarity with\nthe letters to be able to look up words in a dictionary. It\nappears, then, either that the extraneous intelligence can compose\n\f250 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART\noriginal Greek (which for the purposes of his argument M.\nRichet seems bound to assume it cannot) or Mme. X. knows\nenough of the Greek alphabet and can apply her knowledge\nwith sufficient intelligence to make appropriate alterations in\nthe text given in the Dictionary.\nThe omission of all the accents in the first seven passages\nof the script, and their sudden appearance later, is another point\nthat tells strongly against the theory of a purely visual and\nmechanical method of production, or against Sir Oliver Lodge's\nhypothesis of a psychic printed text serving as a copy.\n(4) M. Richet argues (p. 182) that since passage IX., written\nin his presence, shows just the same characteristics as VIII.,\nwritten in his absence, it is almost certain that the two\npassages must have been produced under the same conditions.\nMrs. Verral1's analysis, however, shows that IX. was in fact far\nmore inaccurate than VIII., and that VIII. D (which is the longest\nof the four portions into which VIII. is divided, being made\nup of 77 words, whereas the other three portions together\ncontain 85 words), \" presents a much more scholarly appear\nance than any other passage and contains only 3 mistakes\n(or possibly 2).\"\nThis is obviously what would be expected if VIII. had\nbeen simply copied from the Dictionary, while IX. had been\nlearnt by heart and written out from memory.\n(5) As to the difficulty of supposing that Mme. X. could\nhave had access to so rare a book as the Byzantios Dictionary,\nit must be remembered, assuming fraud, that it was she who\nhad the initiative in selecting the book. It is not unreasonable\nto suppose that, if she were fraudulent, she would naturally\nselect a rare book in hopes of not being afterwards found out.\nBesides, as M. Richet states, the book is in the library at\nParis, in which it is known that Mme. X. is in the habit of\nstudying, and the Greek-French part to which nearly all, if\nnot all, the quotations from the Dictionary have been traced,\nis cut, while the French-Greek part, to which Mrs. Verrall has\napparently traced one phrase (part of X.) is not.1\n1 Mi-. Verrall, however, who has since had an opportunity of seeing the\ncopy from the Paris Library, tella us that parts of the French-Greek section\nare cut, that all the cuts are quite ancient, and that all the pages, cut or\nuncut, can be easily read.\n\fLL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 251\n(6) It is in the Greek-French part chiefly, if not exclusively,\nthat any phrases occur\u2014Greek phrases being given, followed\nby a translation into French. The French-Greek part consists\nalmost entirely of separate words, followed by their Greek\nequivalents. This would certainly make it difficult for a person\nignorant of Greek to look up a given phrase in the Dictionary ;\nbut it would put no difficulty in the way of his making a\nlittle miscellaneous collection of phrases out of it, by glancing\nat the French phrases and learning their Greek equivalents.\nMuch of the script suggests such a heterogeneous collection\nof phrases, and could easily be accounted for by supposing the\nDictionary to have been used in this way.\n(7) Perhaps the argument on which M. Richet lays most\nstress is that based on the applicability of some of the sentences\nwritten in his presence. Some of these do show a certain\napplicability to the circumstances suggestive of knowledge\nand intelligence, and this no doubt has to be accounted for.\nWith regard to VI., X.-XV. inclusive, and Appendix 10-12\n(pp. 206-9), we think with Mrs. Verrall that it would not be\ndifficult to learn up a number of phrases which would be at\nleast as appropriate as these to the circumstances of the sittings\nand which could be produced with the same appearance of\nspontaneity. In order to test this hypothesis, Miss Johnson,\nwho knows no Greek, spent about half-an-hour searching in\nthe Greek-French part of the Dictionary for phrases which\nmight apply to the known circumstances of the case\u2014viz. (1)\nto the general nature and conditions of the phenomenon, and\n(2) to M. Richet's projected journey to England to read a\npaper on it before a meeting of the S.P.R.\nThis brief and cursory search revealed a mine of material\nin the way of phrases, two or three of which might easily have\nbeen learnt at a time and brought in with effect at the next\nsitting. Most of the phrases that actually occur in the script,\nwhen appropriate at all, are, it may be noted, of such a\ngenerally or vaguely applicable nature that no \"forcing\" would\nhave been required. But in any case, supposing phrases had\nbeen learnt, a slight exercise of ingenuity would suffice to lead\nthe conversation on to some topic into which they could be\nintroduced, as answers to or comments upon the remarks of the\nsitter. To illustrate this, we have constructed an \"imaginary\n\f252 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART\nconversation \" between sitter and script, in which the state\nments of the latter are composed exclusively of French phrases\ngiven in the Dictionary with their Greek equivalents.

On the other hand, no one would complain if the\nwriting had no application whatever to the circumstances.\nIndeed, M. Richet does not complain of the flagrant inappro-\npriateness of most of it. A fraudulent medium therefore would\nhave everything to gain and nothing to lose by learning up\nsentences that might with a little luck be appropriate. The\nphrases of salutation and farewell, several times repeated (I.,\nII., V., VIII. C, and Appendix 10-12) could not fail to be\nappropriate.\n(8) Now as to the passage 'xptja-Oai . . . etc.,' on which M.\nRichet lays such stress. A series of passages, five in number,\nVIII. A (two parts) to D, p. 27, were written in M. Richet's\nabsence. These follow one another closely in the Dictionary.\nFour of them have no applicability whatever ; one of them, i.e.\nthe first part of VIII. A, appears to have some. If we are\nto take the exhibition of intelligence as a criterion, why does\nthe presence of this one appropriate sentence, which possibly\nonly comes first because it also comes first in the Dictionary,\nshow intelligence, unless the presence of the other four in\nappropriate ones does not equally show no-intelligence ? The\nchoice of the non-appropriate sentences must admittedly have\nbeen at hap-hazard. Why is the choice of the first not equally\nat hap-hazard ? Either the intelligence knew what it was\nwriting or it did not. If it did, why should the bulk of what\nit wrote have no applicability whatever ? And if it did not,\nhow is it possible to attach any importance to the fact that one\nof the sentences it wrote does appear to have a certain appro\npriateness ? This appears to us an unanswerable dilemma.\nBut we would further argue that although this sentence,\n\"Xpija-Oai, etc.,\" appears to have some appropriateness, it certainly\nhas no meaning. What can it possibly mean to say, \" You\ncan when you like use Greek if by chance Latin fails you,\"\nwhen the Latin of this very sentence appears on the same\nline in the Dictionary, and therefore does not fail anybody ;\nand when in any case the obvious choice is not between Greek\nand Latin but, as indicated in the letter accompanying the\n\f254 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART\nscript, between Greek and French ? We suggest that the words\n' Graecis ' and ' Latinae ' indicated that the sentence had some\nbearing on a choice of language, and therefore prompted the\nselection of the sentence for transcription. If it did mean\nsomething, so much the better, aud the control would, as it\nhas done, make a distinct score. If it did not mean anything,\nit would in no way suffer, any more than it has done from\nhaving written all the other sentences which have no meaning\neither.\n(9) Our argument, then, so far maintains that a number of\nshort passages might have been picked out\u2014partly at random\nand partly for their appropriateness\u2014from the Dictionary and\nlearnt by heart, and that this could be done by a person\nhaving the knowledge of the letters only. The same can\nobviously be said of the quotations from St. John's Gospel.\nOnce Mme. X. had selected a French sentence from it, she need\nhave no difficulty in finding the Greek equivalent.\nMrs. Verrall argues that the case is different with the\nextracts from Plato : (a) that it would be very difficult to find\nthese particular phrases in the two Dialogues supposing one\nhad only an ordinary translation as a guide ; and (6) that the\nremarkable appropriateness of the quotations has to be\naccounted for.\nAs to (a) we cannot help thinking that Mrs. Verrall\nexaggerates the difficulty of finding the phrases by the help\nof a translation. The second quotation from the Apology,\nbeing taken from its last sentence, could, of course, as she\nimplicitly admits, be found easily. The others would take\nmuch more trouble to find, since they occur in the middle\nof the dialogues in question. And as to (fc), this second easily\nfound quotation is to our mind just the only one which is\nreally appropriate at all. The sentence from the \"Phaedrus\"\n(script v., p. 206), which Mrs. Verrall considers specially appro\npriate to the process of automatic writing, does not, we confess,\nimpress us as much as it seems to impress her. All that can be\nsaid for it is that it. is more appropriate than the quotations from\nEugene Sue, and less so than that from Cicero. The remaining\nphrase (script I., 1st sentence, p. 205), quoted from the \"Apology,\"\nis a vague utterance of a type indifferently appropriate or\ninappropriate under almost any conceivable circumstances.\n\fli] Discussion of Professor Richets Case of Xenoglossy. 255\nWe think, in any case, that Mrs. Verral1's argument somewhat\nconfuses the issue. It is not, to our mind, a question of finding\none particular appropriate phrase, but of finding a phrase\nlikely to prove appropriate\u2014obviously a far easier task.\nWhat has to be accounted for, we repeat, in this case as in\nthose already dealt with, is not that these particular passages\nshould have been produced, but that some appropriate passages\nshould be written\u2014a very different as well as an easier thing\nto do, and one which demands intelligence only, and no real\nknowledge of the language.\nThe argument against fraud, then, dwindles down to the\ndifficulty of learning so much Greek by heart. As to Sir\nOliver Lodge's hypothesis that the impression of the Greek\nwords may have come to Mme. X. in the form of a vision\u2014\nlike the crystal visions with which we are familiar\u2014abundant\nanalogies may of course be found for such a supposition, as\nwe know from records in the Proceedings alone that sensory\nhallucinations, whether induced by crystal gazing or occurring\nmore spontaneously, may take the form of any object whatever,\nas well letters or words as anything else. But the form taken\nby the impression does not appear to us a matter of any real\nsignificance. The discussion of automatic processes in Human\nPersonality shows that the question whether an impression\nexternalises itself as a sensory hallucination or as a motor\nimpulse, and the question of what particular sensory or\nmotor effect is produced, depend almost entirely on the\nidiosyncrasies of the automatist. Psychologically the form of\nthe impression is important and interesting, but from the point\nof view of psychical research, what we are concerned with\nis the content alone. We have only to ask whether or not it\ngoes provably beyond the knowledge that the medium either\nalready possesses or could have acquired by normal means.\nWe do not of course mean to assert that\u2014supposing there\nis an external agency concerned in the production of such\nphenomena\u2014that agency may not be limited both in knowledge\nand in the kind and degree of influence which it is able to\nexercise on the medium. Our entire and absolute ignorance of\nthe matter, in fact, affords scope for any and every speculation\nas to what these limitations may be, and it is possible, as Sir\nOliver Lodge suggests, that it may be easier for a control to\nR\n\f256 Hon.

But the assumption\nof such an arbitrary limitation of power seems inconsistent\nwith some crucial features in the case\u2014such as the sub\nstitution of Gallia for Hellas, or the occasional conjunc\ntion of words or phrases that occur separately in the printed\nsources\u2014which would seem to involve wide powers of dealing\nand tampering with the text on the part of the control. And\nsupposing, as Sir Oliver Lodge suggests, that the control\nchooses the text from an out-of-the-way and little known\nbook, so that its source is not detected for a long time, the\nphenomenon might, as he says, at its first appearance seem \" an\nextra good proof of supernormal occurrence,\" but could not fail\nafterwards to appear all the more suspicious. We should then\nhave to make a further hypothesis to explain it; we should\nhave to suppose either that the \" control \" had plotted deliber\nately to cast suspicion on the medium, or that he was so\nextraordinarily stupid that he did not see how suspicious it\nwould look.

And is it not, on the other hand, just wliat\nmight be expected to occur, supposing a person ignorant of\nGreek desired for some reason to produce Greek writing?\nSome other points brought out by Mrs. Verral1's investigations\nstrongly suggest the work of a careful but ignorant copyist\u2014\nviz. the use of, or approximation to, the Roman instead of the\nGreek form of some of the letters. Thus the Roman a is always\nfor a ; the t is dotted six times (though in five cases Mrs.\n11 states that the dot seems to be used instead of an\n\fLi.] Discussion of Professor Richets Case of Xenoglossy. 259\naccent); the down-stroke of the T is curved round at the bottom,\nand once the upright stroke extends above the cross stroke,\nturning the letter completely into a Roman t. Again, the\nletters are liable to be confused with Roman letters resembling\nthem. Thus y is written rather like a y ; r\\ sometimes with a\nshort right-hand stroke, like n ; fj. has sometimes a short left-\nhand stroke, like u ; v throughout VIII. B is written ?\u2022, like\none written form of r; and v is written twice as u. The kind\nof ignorance here shown appears to us to point strongly to a\nmundane source for its origin.\nTo sum up the case, it appears to us that, with the\nsingle exception of the argument based upon Prof. Richet's\nstrong conviction of the medium's bona fides, there is no\nevidence which of itself must compel one to a belief in the\nsupernormal character of the phenomena. Indeed, the facts\nconsidered by themselves seem to point distinctly, though not,\nit is true, inevitably, in the other direction.\nWe have, in addition to the negative arguments already\nadduced, the following positive ones, most of them drawn\nfrom M. Richet's statements :\n(1) Mme. X.'s known desire to learn Greek in November,\n1899.\n(2) The presence of the Greek Dictionary in the library.\n(3) The reproduction of some of the typographical pecul\niarities found in this Dictionary.\n(4) The evidence that Mme. X. may have known a little\nGreek from the substitution of Gallia for Hellas,\nand from the production of one of the sentences by\nraps.\n(5) The evidence of progress in the accuracy of the script:\nsome of the first seven passages being unintelligible,\nand all of them entirely without accents.\n(6) The humming of the tune \"Souvenez vous en\" before\nthe production of the corresponding Greek phrase.\n(7) The fact brought out by Mrs. Verral1's analysis that,\nnotwithstanding M. Richet's statement to the contrary,\nthe longest of the passages written in his absence is\nmuch more scholarly than any other of the whole\nseries.\n\f260 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART\n-\nIf it is necessary to assume anything abnormal in the case,\nit would seem that the abnormality may consist in nothing\nmore than an unusually strong and vivid visual memory, the\nconcentration of which would be assisted by a possibly per\nfectly genuine trance. And if we were obliged to suggest any\ntheory of the genesis of the affair, it would be the following;\nthat at first, possibly as a kind of jest, possibly from a semi\nautomatic impulse,1 Madame X. (who had evidently, judging\nfrom the purchase of the Greek exercise books, a notion of\nlearning Greek and perhaps did get so far as to learn the\nGreek alphabet) produced certain Greek phrases. Finding\nthat these excited serious interest, she kept the game up by\nproducing more. When to her surprise the passages were all\ndiscovered in the Dictionary, she felt she had gone too far to\nretreat, and could not bring herself to admit that she either\npossessed or had had access to the Dictionary. Expecting that\ntests would then be made, she resorted to a more elaborate\nprocedure, though even here we have to assume nothing more\nthan a little trouble taken to learn by heart for the next\nsitting one fairly long sentence (IX.) as well as six short\nones (X.-XV.) bearing on probable subjects of conversation,\nto be produced when occasion offered. It would not have\nbeen very difficult to do this during the week or two that\nelapsed after M. Richet had first mentioned the Dictionary\nto her before the sitting of May 2nd. The last of the six\nshort sentences so selected had, perhaps, struck the medium's\nfancy as being identical with the refrain of a song which she\nhappened to know, and, as remarked above, it looks as if she\n1 Some years ago, whether before or after the commencement of the production\nof this Greek script cannot, on account of the notes of the incident having\nbeen mislaid, be remembered, Mme. X., in the presence of Mr. Piddington and\nMr. Feilding, went suddenly off into what appeared to be a genuine trance.\nIn this condition she made signals for paper and pencil, and wrote a short\nsentence in what looked like Arabic. The script, on being sent to an Arabic\nscholar, was pronounced to be intelligible, but consisted only of a conple of\nvery familiar words, such as would be found on Oriental carpets or embroideries,\nCairo tea trays, etc. The production of such words, though it could have\nno tendency to show the operation of any extraneous Arab intelligence or\nsupernormal agency, and would therefore be of no ' metapsychical ' importance,\nhas a certain psychological interest, and would be quite consistent with\ncomplete honesty on the part of Mme. X. It seems not impossible that the\nfirst Greek sentence may have been produced in a similar way.\n\fI.I.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 261\nhad hummed this song in M. Richet's presence with a view\nto introducing the phrase with apparent appropriateness later.\nIn conclusion we wish to add that we feel with M.\nBichet the greatest difficulty in reconciling the above tentative\ntheory with the personal knowledge, slight as it is, which wo\nhave of Mme. X. And if we venture to put it forward, it is\nonly because our Society has always regarded it as an im\nperative necessity to criticise freely whatever evidence for\nsupernormal phenomena may be put before it. It is in ac\ncordance with this accepted principle that we have ventured\nto examine the validity of Professor Richet's argument, our\ninability to see the force of which may, after all, be purely\nconstitutional to ourselves. It may be assumed that our\ninterest in the phenomena under consideration is of itself suffi\ncient to raise in us an earnest hope that the course of events\nmay prove us wrong, and in anticipation of that happy issue\nwe offer our apologies to Prof. Richet and Mme. X. for the\ncontent.s of the above article.\n\f262 Professor Charles Richet.\nIV.\nR\u00c9PONSE AUX OBSERVATIONS DE M. E. FEILDING\nET DE MLLE. ALICE JOHNSON.\nPar M. le Professeur Charles Richet.\nJe r\u00e9pondrai bri\u00e8vement aux observations de M. E. Feilding\net de Madelle Alice Johnson.\nIl y a d'abord un point de doctrine qui peut \u00eatre r\u00e9solu\nen quelques mots. Il s'agit, disent mes critiques, de savoir\nsi leur explication est plus simple et plus facile (easier)\nque la mienne. Ce n'est pas ainsi que la question se\npose : car je ne donne aucune explication. Si j'en donnais une,\nje comprendrais fort bien qu'on lui oppos\u00e2t l'argument simple\u2014\nvoire m\u00eame simpliste\u2014de la fraude. Mais je ne construis\nabsolument aucune th\u00e9orie : de sorte que l'explication par la\nfraude n'est ni plus simple, ni plus facile que la mienne;\npuisque je n'en donne pas. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 il n'y a rien, il n'y a pas\nlieu de faire une comparaison. Je pr\u00e9tends seulement que cette\nexplication par la fraude\u2014sans la mettre en balance avec les\nautres explications\u2014ne peut pas se soutenir.\nEt bien entendu je laisse de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les objections morales ; et\nje ne prends que les objections techniques.\nM\u00eame, dans ces objections techniques, je ne reviendrai pas sur\ndivers points de d\u00e9tail. Il est clair en effet qu'il est peu\nimportant de savoir si le dictionnaire de Byzantios est rare ou\ncommun, si certaines pages sont coup\u00e9es ou non coup\u00e9es, et si\nle dictionnaire fran\u00e7ais-grec peut servir, quand on l'\u00e9tudie \u00e0\nfond, \u00e0 construire des phrases s'adaptant aux conditions ex\nt\u00e9rieures. Il est \u00e9vident aussi que l'\u00e9criture trembl\u00e9e ne prouve\nque l'inexp\u00e9rience de l'\u00e9criture. Rien de moins ; rien de plus.\nCe qui est essentiel, le voici, sous forme de syllogisme\nrigoureux.\n(1) Mad. X. ne sait pas le grec.\n(2) Les phrases qu'elle a \u00e9crites sont des phrases reproduites\npar m\u00e9moire visuelle, et non par m\u00e9moire phon\u00e9tique.\n(3) Or il n'est pas possible de supposer que la m\u00e9moire\nvisuelle soit assez puissante pour fournir de longues phrases,.\n\fLi.] Reply to the Hon. E. Feilding and A. Johnson. 263\ndont le sens est incompris, et qui ne se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que par de\npurs signes visuels.\nJe vais d\u00e9montrer successivement ces trois points.\n(1\u00b0) Mad. X. ne sait pas le grec. Sur ce point l'argumentation\nde Mad. Verrall est d\u00e9cisive. MM. F. et J. sont forc\u00e9s de le\nreconna\u00eetre (she knows extremely little). Mais cet extr\u00eamement\npeu de grec est si peu que ce n'est rien. Les efforts que Mad.\nX. a faits pour apprendre le grec se sont born\u00e9s \u00e0 faire acheter\ndeux livres grecs scolaires par une de ses amies, et \u00e0 ne pas\nles regarder. Il n'y a d'ailleurs, dans ces deux livres, aucun\nalphabet qui permette d'apprendre les lettres. (Je sais par\nfaitement qu'on peut se procurer sans peine un alphabet grec.)\nEt puis, si r\u00e9ellement Mad. X. e\u00fbt voulu me dissimuler\nqu'elle avait fait emplette de ces deux livres, rien ne lui\ne\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 plus facile. Elle e\u00fbt sans effort pu cacher ces deux\nminuscules volumes ; et supprim\u00e9 alors un argument qui parait\nimportant \u00e0 MM. F. et J. (1. Mad. X.'s desire to learn Greek).\n(2e) Les phrases sont de l'\u00e9criture lue, et non phon\u00e9tiquement\nprononc\u00e9e.\nLe fait est capital et m\u00e9rite toute notre attention.\nD'abord je ne comprends pas comment MM. F. et J. peuvent\ndire qu'il n'existe, dans le cas actuel, que peu d'exemples \u00e9tablis\nsant que la reproduction s'est faite par la m\u00e9moire visuelle. En\nr\u00e9alit\u00e9 toutes les lettres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduites par m\u00e9moire visuelle.\nPaT exemple, quand il y a \" . . . oXa etc. . . . \" et que le texte\ngrec porte \"... 6\\a etc. ...\" il est \u00e9vident que ces deux\npoints qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent et ces deux points qui suivent ne r\u00e9pondent\n\u00e0 aucun phon\u00e9tisme, mais seulement \u00e0 un fait de repr\u00e9sentation\nvisuelle. De m\u00eame pour tous les accents, sans exception. Si l'on\nne peut pas citer beaucoup de mots o\u00f9 la repr\u00e9sentation visuelle\nse r\u00e9v\u00e8le avec \u00e9clat, c'est que, toutes les fois que la copie est\nexacte, on ne saurait d\u00e9cider s'il s'agit de phon\u00e9tisme ou de\nvisualisation. Mais alors pourquoi les accents ? Pourquoi y\na-t-il tov KAw&Woy exactement comme dans le texte, alors\nque la m\u00e9moire phon\u00e9tique e\u00fbt pu faire \u00e9crire, par celui qui\nignore le grec, aussi bien T\u00f4v K.\\wStovo\u00e7 que tov K.XwSlwvo\u00e7 ?\nEt pareille argumentation peut se r\u00e9p\u00e9ter pour tous les mots\nsans exception.\nDe sorte qu'il est \u00e9vident que tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par visualisation,\net non par phon\u00e9tisme.\n\f264 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nDonc nul doute sur ce point. Ce n'est pas par phon\u00e9tisme\nqu'il y a eu m\u00e9moire repr\u00e9sentative, c'est par visualisation.\nOr est-il possible de concevoir une m\u00e9moire assez \u00e9tendue\npour reproduire des signes visuels (et d\u00e9pourvus de sens, puisque\nMad. X. ne sait pas le grec), en aussi grand nombre et avec\nune telle perfection ?\nJe sugg\u00e9rerai \u00e0 MM. F. et J. une exp\u00e9rience simple qu'ils\npourront faire sur eux-m\u00eames ; c'est uniquement de prendre trois\nlignes d'un livre arabe, par exemple, de faire travailler l\u00e0 dessus\nleur m\u00e9moire pendant plusieurs heures, et en tous loisirs,\npuis ensuite, le m\u00eame jour, de reproduire ces signes avec assez\nde pr\u00e9cision pour qu'ils puissent \u00eatre lus par un Arabe.\nQuoique je sois dou\u00e9 d'une fort bonne m\u00e9moire, je d\u00e9clare\npour ma part qu'il me serait tout \u00e0 fait impossible de repro\nduire de m\u00e9moire une seule ligne. Et que l'on songe alors\nque Mad. X. a \u00e9crit ainsi par visualisation, le 2 Mai, toute\nune s\u00e9rie de phrases.1 Cela fait 622 signes, assez correcte\nment \u00e9crits pour qu'il soit difficile \u00e0 un copiste, d'habilet\u00e9\nmoyenne, de faire aussi peu de fautes.\nEt alors je conclurai en disant : Reproduire, uniquement par\nvisualisation, 622 signes, cela d\u00e9passe les bornes de la m\u00e9moire\nhumaine. Jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'on m'ait montr\u00e9 un pareil prodige,\nje persisterai \u00e0 trouver l'hypoth\u00e8se d'une m\u00e9moire extraordi-\nnairement suractiv\u00e9e, comme d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de toute autorit\u00e9..\nD'ailleurs je trouve cet aveu dans la remarque que sont\n'contraints de faire MM. F. et J. \" The abnormality lies in\nan unusually strong and vivid visual memory.\" Et \u00e0 la\nv\u00e9rit\u00e9 je ne puis affirmer autre chose, en tant qu'il s'agit de\n\u2022discuter les conditions techniques. Mais on avouera qu'une\nhyperacuit\u00e9 de la m\u00e9moire, telle qu'on n'en saurait pas citer\nd'exemple, ne peut servir d'explication \u00e0 un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne d\u00e9j\u00e0\nrendu invraisemblable, \u00e0 priori, par l'ensemble des conditions\nmorales o\u00f9 il s'est produit.2\n1 MM. F. et J. supposent avec raison que j'ai pris toutes pr\u00e9cautions pour\n\u2022emp\u00eacher qu'il y e\u00fbt une page quelconque \u00e9crite par avance, dissimul\u00e9e p*r\nMad. X., et qu'il lui e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 loisible de copier devant moi.\n2 Si l'on fait cette supposition d'une hyperacuit\u00e9 de la m\u00e9moire, il faut\najouter sa persistance pendant un temps prolong\u00e9. Car Mad. X., qui a \u00e9t\u00e9\ntr\u00e8s rarement \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale avant 1900, depuis cette \u00e9poque n'y\nest pas retourn\u00e9e, ainsi que je puis le prouver.\nLes cartes d\u00e9livr\u00e9es par la direction de la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de Paris\nsont de deux ordres.

Johnson. 265\nAinsi nous arrivons \u00e0 cette conclusion qu'on est forc\u00e9, en tout\n\u00abtat de cause, d'admettre un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne anormal, \u00e0 savoir une\nm\u00e9moire visuelle d'une intensit\u00e9 telle qu'elle est jusqu'\u00e0\npr\u00e9sent totalement inconnue. Mais il faut alors reconna\u00eetre\nque ce n'est pas une explication rationnelle. On doit con\nsid\u00e9rer comme rationnel ce qui est \u00e9tabli par l'exp\u00e9rience ;\nor nulle exp\u00e9rience n'a jusqu'ici prouv\u00e9 que la m\u00e9moire visuelle\npeut reproduire vingt-cinq lignes d'une langue inconnue.\nIl est un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'appr\u00e9ciation sur lequel n'insistent\ngu\u00e8re MM. E. F. et A. J. Mais j'y insisterai ; car il est de\nmajeure importance. C'est la phrase qui est traduite de\nCic\u00e9ron ; et dans laquelle le texte latin et le texte grec sont\nseuls donn\u00e9s, de sorte que Mad. X., qui ne connait pas le latin,\na \u00e9crit la phrase grecque, sans savoir quel en \u00e9tait le sens.\nquand on le demande. De celles-l\u00e0 il n'est pas tenu registre. Il y a aussi\nles cartes r\u00e9guli\u00e8res dont on tient compte et qu'on classe. D'apr\u00e8s une lettre\nque m'adresse le directeur de la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale, il n'y a pas eu de\ncarte r\u00e9guli\u00e8re d\u00e9livr\u00e9e \u00e0 Mad. X. de 1894 \u00e0 1904. Si donc elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la\nBiblioth\u00e8que nationale, c'a \u00e9t\u00e9 avec une carte d\u00e9livr\u00e9e pour un jour.\nD'autre part, en interrogeant Mad. X., j'ai appris d'elle\u2014ce que j'avais\nindiqu\u00e9 d'ailleurs, mais avec moins de certitude\u2014qu'elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 travailler\n\u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale depuis 1899.\nDe fait, elle m'a dit n'y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'une fois, et elle m'a montr\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet\nson Diary, de 1899.

X.\nn'a pas pu consulter \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale le Dictionnaire de Byzantios,\nde sorte que, si l'on fait cette hypoth\u00e8se, toute gratuite d'ailleurs, que les\npagee du Dictionnaire fran\u00e7ais-grec ont \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9es par elle, c'a \u00e9t\u00e9 en 1899 ;\nce qui rend plus extraordinaire encore la persistance de la m\u00e9moire visuelle\njusqu'au mois de Mai, 1905, pour toute une longue s\u00e9rie de longues phrases.\nAu fond cela n'a pas grande importance ; car, si l'on fait l'hypoth\u00e8se (absurde\n\u00e0 mon sens) de la fraude, il est beaucoup plus simple de supposer que Mad.

Certain Mental Changes\nthat Accompany Visceral Disease. By HENRY HEAD, M.U.,\nF.R.S. (Reprinted from Brain, Vol. XXIV., Part III., 1901.)\nLondon: John Bale, Sons & Danielsson, Ltd. 1901.\nThese lectures should have received an earlier notice in the\nProceedings, for, though addressed primarily to the physician,\nthey have an important bearing on a subject of special\ninterest for our Society.\nIt has long been recognised, Dr. Head points out, that\ngrave mental changes often arise in connection with visceral\ndiseases. Delirium, for instance, is directly traceable to a\nfailing heart, the hebetude of myxoedema to a diseased con\ndition of the thyroid gland, and morbid mental states follow\ntoxic poisoning of the blood due to disease of some excreting\norgan.\nBut what had not been formerly recognised is that certain\nwell-marked and characteristic changes in consciousness may\nbe traced to the effects of the reflected pains of visceral\ndisease. To Dr. Henry Head belongs the credit of this\ndiscovery.1\n1Professor Charles Lasigue had, indeed, long before published the following\nobservations: \u2014 \"C'est surtout dans les affections mitrales que le cauchemar\ns'observe : le sommeil, dans sa periode il'etat, [i.e. between 1 and 3 a.m. : the\nthird and most stable period of sleep, according to Prof. Lasi'gue's ' chronology\nof sleep '] est trouble par de la peur, de 1'anxi^te, de 1'augoisse non respiratoire\nft des hallucination visuelles.

G. Piddington. [PART\nThese changes in consciousness are moods of depression and\nof exaltation ; a state of unreasonable suspicion ; and hallucina\ntions of vision, hearing, and smell. It is with the last class\nonly that this review is concerned.\n. Dr. Head's investigations extended over a period of some\nseven or eight years. In all he had under observation 192\ncases of men and women suffering from some form of visceral\ndisease : chiefly pulmonary, cardiac, or abdominal. The patients\nwere inmates of the Victoria Park Hospital for Diseases of\nthe Chest and of the London Hospital, and belonged to the\nusual hospital class. No patient who had been insane, or\nwho was at the time suffering from any form of nervous\ndisease, or who was suspected of alcoholic excess or of here\nditary taint of insanity or epilepsy was included in the\ninvestigation.\nThis was a natural and proper precaution, but Dr. Head\nwas not content to stop there, for he went to the length of\nexcluding \" all Hebrews, owing to the recognised tendency of\nthis race to functional neuroses.\" I would not regard this\nprecaution as over-scrupulous. But Dr. Head might, without\nconfusing the main issue, have adopted the less drastic and\nmore instructive plan of dealing separately with the Jewish\ncases, which could afterwards have been compared with the\nresults obtained with patients of other nationalities ; and then,\nhad any marked divergence between the two been shown to-\nexist, we might have learned whether a racial tendency ta\nfunctional neuroses renders a member of the Jewish race\nmore liable or less liable to hallucinations of the senses when\nsuffering from visceral disease. Furthermore, Dr. Head was\ncareful to exclude all experiences which might have had an\nobjective basis (i.e. illusions), and also \" illusions hypnagogiqufs.\"\nIn every case Dr. Head interrogated the patients himself,\nhimself took the notes, and, except towards the end of the\ninvestigation, when it was desirable to have his observations\ncontrolled by others, he took care to question his patients in\nprivacy ; for they were reticent as to their experiences and\nafraid of being thought madmen or liars. Psychical Researchers\nwho speaks of cardiac disease only and does not note the connection between\niflected pain of visceral origin and the hallucinations, be held to rank with\nHead's exhaustive and systematic study.\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian lectures. 269\noften have to circumvent similar reticences, though sometimes,\nit must be admitted, it is rather an exuberant and irrepressible\neffusiveness which makes their task a difficult one.\nI will now try to state, in as brief and simple a manner\nas I can, the conclusions to which his researches led Dr.\nHead: conclusions which I am not competent to criticise, but\nwhich cannot, I imagine, in View of the thoroughness which\nmarks his work, fail to meet with the acceptance of medical\nmen.\nThe main factor underlying the production of all the mental\nchanges in question, viz. moods of depression and of exalta\ntion, states of unreasonable suspicion, and hallucinations of the\nsenses, is the presence of reflected visceral pain of considerable\nintensity and duration, accompanied by superficial tenderness.\nBut the causes underlying each separate form of these\nmental changes can be further differentiated ; and each will\nbe found to appear, usually if not invariably, in relation to\ncertain well-defined varieties of reflected visceral pain.\nThus the depressed mood is specially associated with pain\nand tenderness over the abdominal areas. The sense of ex\naltation or of exaggerated well-being may arise from various\ncauses. It may be no more than a reaction from a preceding\nmood of depression,\u2014such alternations of feeling-tone being\nspecially pronounced in the case of sufferers from visceral\npain\u2014or it may be due to the patient's ignorance of the\ngravity of his condition, or, in disease of the aortic valves, to\nattacks of excitement of apparently vascular origin. The state\nof suspicion is merely a development of the mood of depression\nor of ill-being which invariably precedes or accompanies it.\nWe come now to the last and most important class\u2014most\nimportant, as affording evidence of the most obvious and\nunmistakable deviation from the normal\u2014I mean, hallucina\ntions of the senses.\nHallucinations are always preceded by the appearance of\nthe depressed mood : but, though the same rule applies,\nvisual hallucinations are not necessarily contemporaneous with\nan attack of depression.\nProbably headache is the only necessary concomitant of the\nhallucinations; for in every case where Dr. Head was able to\nmake a complete examination of the patient within 24 hours\n\f270 i\/. G. Piddington. [PART\nof the occurrence of a hallucination, scalp tenderness of the\nreflected visceral type was found to be present : and herpes\nzoster ophthalmicus, a disease (not of visceral origin) involving\nintense pain over the forehead, but not necessarily preceded nor\naccompanied by marked depression, is liable to produce visual\nhallucinations. If, in addition to headache of the reflected\nvisceral type, there is similar *pain and tenderness over the\ntrunk, the tendency to hallucination is increased.\nBut here the question presents itself: What determines\nwhether the hallucination shall be visual, auditory or olfactory ?\nAn analysis of the cases where a hallucination occurred\nduring the patient's stay in hospital has convinced Dr. Head\nthat no permanent error in the sense organ implicated was\nresponsible for the form of the hallucination, and has led him\nto suggest tentatively that the sense affected depends on the\nposition of the headache and on the area of the accompanying\nscalp tenderness. Thus, visual hallucinations are mainly\nassociated with tenderness over the forehead ; auditory halluci\nnations with tenderness over the parietal and vertical regions ;\nand olfactory hallucinations with tenderness over the temporal\narea of the scalp.\nMy next task is to enumerate, as far as possible in Dr.\nHead's own words, the main characteristic features of hallu\ncinations that accompany visceral disease, and at the same\ntime to enquire to what extent the same features appear\nin the hallucinations of the sane and healthy collected by the\nS.P.B. For the purpose of this enquiry I shall but seldom\ngo outside the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, and I\nmake this large use of the Census Report partly for con\nvenience of reference, and partly because it comprises cases of\nso widely representative a character that it rarely fails to\nfurnish the needed parallel or antithesis.\nBut as the comparison and discussion on which I am\nabout to embark will involve me in an amount of detail\nwhich is likely to seem excessive and tedious, I should like,\nby way of apology, to preface them by an explanation of the\nmotives which have led me to undertake them.\nA friend, who first drew my attention to these lectures,\ngave me to understand that the hallucinations of persons\nsuffering from visceral disease, as described by Dr. Head, showed\n\fu.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 271\ndamaging points of resemblance to the hallucinations of the\nsupposedly sane and healthy, as represented in the Society's\ncollection of cases. I accordingly took up Dr. Head's lectures\nin some trepidation. It is true that a hasty perusal was\nsufficient to dissipate any misgivings, but others, who, like\nmy friend, have not made a close study of the class of\nhallucinations with which our Society is specially concerned,\nmight not so readily detect how non-essential such resemblances\nas do exist between the two really are. For their benefit\nprimarily I have undertaken to work out in detail the\nresemblances and differences.\nIn the second place, it seemed to me that a comparison of\nthe hallucinations of the sane and healthy with those of the\nsane and unhealthy was likely to prove of interest for its\nown sake.\nThirdly, although Dr. A. T. Myers \" carefully considered \"\nthe 146 cases of hallucination reported in the Census Collection\nin which a certain degree of ill-health was reported, and\n\" gave special attention to their medical aspect, so far as\nthis could be judged from the information given,\" we are\nacquainted only with the results of his labours, and are not\nallowed to follow step by step the process by which the\nCommittee, acting on his advice, rejected some and retained\nothers of these particular cases. As, then, the Census Report\ndid not provide any detailed comparison of the hallucinations\nof persons in good health with those of persons in disease,\nsuch a comparison, even though restricted, as here, to one\nspecial\u2014albeit a very large and comprehensive\u2014group of\ndiseases, seems to me to be worth the making.\nIn the fourth place, at the time when the Census Report\nwas published the medical world did not know of (and did\nnot even, I believe, suspect) the association of certain changes\nin consciousness, among which hallucinations occupy a prominent\nplace, with the reflected pains of visceral disease. Moreover,\nthe Committee, while rejecting 23 cases as being clearly due\nto a morbid physical condition, retained 123 cases of halluci\nnations experienced during a state of illness when the morbid\nconditions were such as were not then known to be associated\ngenerally with hallucination. \" In 21 of them, says the\nReport, the percipient was in a state of convalescence after\ns\n\f272 J. 0. Piddington. [pabt\nsome illness,\u2014the nature of which is not always specified, but\nwhich was apparently acute,\u2014or recovering from a recent\noperation, or on the verge of a severe illness. In 55 cases\nthe percipient was in a state of depressed health or minor\nillness\u2014e.g. ' in a nervous dyspeptic condition? ' in a very low\nstate of health' ' bronchitis with weakness of heart '\u2014the con\ndition being one with which hallucinations are not supposed to be\ngenerally associated, though it may have rendered the patient\nmore liable to them than a person in normal health would be.\nThere remain 4-7 cases of still slighter indisposition than the\nabove, such as being ' a little below par, and somewhat nervous\nand excited' where it seems very doubtful whether the physical\ncondition had any share in producing the hallucination.\" (Pro\nceedings, Vol. X., p. 160.)\nNow, especially among the 55 cases mentioned above,\nit seemed to me far from unlikely that there might be some\nwhich were due to reflected pain of visceral origin : such,\nfor instance, as the hallucination experienced by the percipient\nsuffering \" from bronchitis with weakness of heart.\"\nAgain, the Report states (p. 161) that \"in 780 first-hand\ncases (that is, 48 per cent.), no statement at all is made as\nto health.\" The Committee, it is true, were of opinion that\n\" the tendency was rather to exaggerate than to overlook any\npossible connection that there may have been between the\nhallucination and the state of health at the time.\" With this\nopinion I find myself so far in agreement as to have little\ndoubt that had a person experienced a hallucination within\na few days of an attack of, say, typhoid or scarlet fever he\nwould, in answering the Census questionnaire, have drawn\nattention to the probable connection between the two events.\nBut visceral diseases are less abrupt and more insidious in\ntheir onset, and may remain undetected and unsuspected for\nmany a month ; and even if already causing some degree of\ndiscomfort or uneasiness, might easily be dismissed in all\ngood faith by the person affected in some such phrase as \"a\nlittle below par,\" or \" in a very low state of health.\"\nOn this ground, then, an advocatus diaboli might argue that\nmany a case out of the 780 where the percipient gave no\naccount of his state of health, and even a few out of the\n719 cases where the percipient positively affirmed his state of\n\fLI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 273\nhealth to be good, ought properly to have been rejected, as\nbeing outside the scope of the Census, the aim of which\nwas to ascertain the proportion of persons who \" have had\nsensory hallucinations while awake, and not suffering from\ndelirium or insanity or any other morbid condition obviously\nconducive to hallucination.\"\nNow supposing that an examination conducted in the light\nof the new facts which Dr. Head has contributed to medical\nscience should justify the criticism of my imaginary devi1's\nadvocate, what would the effect be ? It might result in a large\nnumber of the so-called \" purely subjective \" cases having to be\ndiscounted, and yet might leave the \" coincidental \" cases un\ntouched. But such a result would be improbable, for coincidental\nappear to be distinguished from subjective hallucinations solely\nby their greater impressiveness and by their greater liability to\naffect more than one sense. These by themselves are but flimsy\ndifferentiae ; and if in other respects many of the coincidental\nhallucinations were found to show affinity to hallucinations\nof the visceral type, there would be left only their \"veridicality\"\nto explain away ; and that would not be a difficult task for\ndestructive criticism to achieve, once granted that the characteristic\nfeature-s of the hallucinations associated with visceral disease\nwere found to be present in coincidental cases.\n(It is true that such affinity would not in itself explain away\nthe coincidences if they were sufficiently numerous and definite;\nbut it would very strongly suggest that the percipients in these\nparticular coincidental cases were suffering from a visceral disease,\nand were therefore liable to repeated hallucinations (v. XV.,\np. 323); and that accordingly the coincidences were due to\nchance and not to any telepathic action. This argument would\ndo no more than make the justifiable assumption that the per\ncipients had forgotten or deliberately ignored the considerable\nnumber of their hallucinations with which no coincidence had\nbeen traced.)\nOne aim, therefore, of this review is to forestall any such\nattack ; and a defence to be satisfactory\u2014satisfactory, at least\nto me, who, like the Sosnik in Maxim Gorky's tale, \" live\non worms and like facts\"\u2014must rely not on broad denials\nbased on broader generalisations, but on a minute and thorough\ngoing dissection of the evidence.\n\f274 J.

[PART\nFor the sake of brevity I shall speak of persons suffering\nfrom visceral diseases generally and of Dr. Head's patients\nin particular as \" Visceral Patients,\" of their hallucinations as\n\" Visceral Hallucinations,\" and of the type of their hallucina\ntions as the \" Visceral type \" ; of persons of whose experiences\nan account has been contributed to the S.P.H., and especially\nto the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, as \" Psychical\nPercipients,\" and of their hallucinations as \" Psychical Hallucina\ntions.\" I do not attempt to defend these barbarous terms\non any ground whatever except that of convenience.\nAll references to Vol. X. of the S.P.R.

(See Phantasms of the Living,\nVol. L, p. 503.)\"\nBut of hallucinations occurring during ill-health, the Com\nmittee reported : \" The proportion of realistic human apparitions\n(69 out of the 106 visual cases) is, however, distinctly small.\nAnd the non-realistic apparitions include a disproportionately\nlarge number (namely, 9), of grotesque, horrible, or monstrous\napparitions.\" (161)\nI.

How\noften would one in a normal state, after seeiug a real live\nflesh-and-blood figure of man or woman, be able to decide on\nexamination of one's recollections whether one had seen the legs\nor feet unless something had specially drawn attention to them ]\nIn the second case (293-5), after a conversation with\nthe percipient, Mrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\" She did not see the\nfigure clearly at all below the knees.\" The case, a coinci\ndental one, compares as follows with the Visceral type :\nResemblances.\nFigure did not speak (v.

Skirts and\ntrousers are mentioned specifically, and though skirts and\ntrousers are not legs, still as they cover the places where\nlegs ought to be, it would be unfair not to infer that they\nhid spectral legs from view.\nArms and movements of arms are frequently mentioned.\nBut the point is really met by the constant insistence of\nPsychical Percipients on the life-like completeness of the figures\nwhich they saw.\nA proportionately greater number of instances of limbless\nfigures probably exists in the specially marked class of incom\npletely developed hallucinations, with regard to which the\nCommittee write:\u2014\n\" They are either shadowy, vague, transparent, or colourless ;\nor they represent part only of the human form, the rest being\nconspicuously absent {not merely apparently hidden by inter\nvening objects.)\"\nWith regard to these incompletely developed apparitions,\nhowever, it should be borne in mind that the Committee were\ncareful to explain that they classed them among the \" doubt\nful experiences.\" A certain proportion of them they excluded\nfrom their Tables, and that they did not exclude more may\nbe attributed chiefly to their desire to avoid the charge of\n\f278 J.

The great majority of hallucinations\nare like the sights we are accustomed to see.\" (113)\nAgain, here, as in the case of limbless figures, the few\ncases of shrouded or draped figures which do occur in the\nCensus collection are to be found almost entirely among the\nimperfectly developed class, in which, says the Report (118),\nwere placed \" veiled and shrouded apparitions even when quite\nsolid looking.\" Yet even these cases do not necessarily con\nform completely to the Visceral type. The two cases of the\nkind quoted as illustrations in the Report (119-120) both\nexhibit some points of divergence. In the first case a lady,\nwho reports herself as having been at the time in good health,\nsaw a \"draped and shrouded figure standing near\" her. The\nface she could not see, because \" it was shrouded \" ; the head\nwas bent, and the figure, which did not move nor speak,\ngradually faded away. But note the distinctions from the\nVisceral type : the arms were seen and said to be crossed ;\nit was a solitary experience, and, though a solitary experience,\nno mention is made of fright (v. V.). On the contrary, the\npercipient writes : \" I thought it might be some one with a\nmessage to me, and sat quietly waiting for it to speak.\"\n(For further comments on this case, v. XIX.) In the second\ncase the percipient had seen a hallucinatory figure three times\nin the course of two or three years. The figure \" always\nappeared in the same way ; that is, on getting into bed and\nputting the light out, there would be a sort of movement in the\nair, which gradually took the form of mist and then developed\ninto a dark veiled figure, which came nearer to me, and when\nbending over and about to touch me, I threw my lutnds into it\nand it vanished.

I. h). But, per contra\nthe figure was not stationary (v. I. h), and the percipient says,\n\" I have always been in good health.\"\nOnly 19 cases of a veiled or shrouded figure are to be\nfound in the Census collection. A case is recorded (204-5)\nwhere two sisters collectively felt a hallucinatory touch on the\nface, while one of them thought she saw a figure, ; this joint\nexperience being followed a week or so later by both awaking\nfrom sleep with a sense of some one being present in the room.\nThen, again, after an interval of some days, one sister saw \"a\nvery vague muffled form or shadow ; and lastly, on another\noccasion\" the other sister \"saw a vague form.\" The figure appar\nently on each occasion took the same course, namely, appeared\nstanding between the two beds and then passed from one to the\nother. Great terror VMS felt by both sisters. The terror (v. V.),\nthe vagueness of the figure, and perhaps the movement (v. I. A),\naccord with the Visceral type ; but, on the other hand, the\ncollectivity of the tactile hallucination, and of the sense of\npresence, the apparent identity of the two visual experiences,\ntogether with the improbability of two percipients, who both\nreport their health at the time as good, being both in the\nincipient stages of some disease of visceral origin, make it\nimpossible to consider their experiences as attributable to\nvisceral disease.\nI. (c). \" The face is frequently misty.\"\n\" The face is frequently not visible.\"\nIt is unnecessary to labour this point. Any one who will\ntake no more trouble than to scan either the Census Report or\nthe S.P.R. Proceedings or Journal passim will readily discover\nthat mistiness of the face is emphatically not a trait of S.P.R.\napparitions, and that 'Psychical Percipients again and again\ninsist on the distinctness of the features of the hallucinatory\nfigure.

The face was certainly not\nseen by the majority, either because of the general indistinct\nness of the figure or because the head was turned away ; and\nthe want of precision in the evidence leaves it doubtful whether\neven a single one of the percipients ever saw the face.\nSimilarly, in the second case (344-6), also collective and\nrecurrent, it remains uncertain how many of the percipients\nsaw the face of the figure, or rather figures, for there were\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head's Gouletonian Lectures. 281\ntwo ghosts, hunting in couples.

(d). [The face] \"when seen is always beardless.\"\nI have come across only four references to the beard of an\napparition in the Census collection.\nThe first is of little value, as it does not occur in the\naccount of the percipient herself, but only in that of the\npercipient's sister. The latter writes :\n\" You said a tall gentleman, dressed in tweed, walked past\nyou, and went into a little inlet or creek. I think, but am\nnot sure, that you said he had a beard.\"\nThe other three references are, however, unimpeachable.\nMr. Heintze writes:\n\" Une figure humaine se forma. . . . Dans cette figure je\nreconnus mon pere. M etait en frac, il avait des moustaches\nfortement grises, comme de son vivant, mais outre cela une courte\nbarbe compUtement blanche, que je ne lui connaissais pas.\" (379)\nThe beard in this case is specially interesting, because,\nquite unknown to the percipient, his father had in his last\nillness grown a small and perfectly white beard.\nCountess Euge\"nie Kapnist writes :\n\" Mes yeux prirent connaissa-iux des moindres details de ce\nvisage, qui me sembla connu: . . . un menton tres maigre d\nbarbe rare et d'un blond foncd.\" (285)\nDr. Vladimir Solovioff writes :\n\" L'homme blanc approcha de mon lit. ... II se pencha\nsur moi, et alors je vis distinctement les traits de sa figure.\nElle ttait tres pdle et d'un type mongol mitigd, avec une petite\nbarbe d'un roux clair.\" (202-3)\n(Note the colour of the beard in these last two cases, and\nv. IIL).\nStill, although these are the only four references to beards\nthat I can find in the Census Report, there is little reason\nto suppose that S.P.R. apparitions are necessarily beardless.\n\f282 J. G. Piddington. [part\nApparitions are frequently recognised as perfect likenesses of\nmale relations or friends, and a beard must have been\nwanted in some of these cases to make the likeness complete.\nI. (\u00ab). \" Patients express great difficulty in deciding whether\nthe figure was that of a man or a woman. The face is fre\nquently not visible. When seen it is always beardless, which\nmakes many say they think it must have been a woman.\"\nWith one exception, and that a case presenting in all other\nrespects the strongest possible contrast to the Visceral type\n(v. 196), I can find only among the \"incompletely developed\"\nclass instances of doubt as to the sex of the apparition\n(e.g. 120, 268, and 312). Out of 793 apparitions of human\nfigures reported at first hand 673 were classed as \"realistic,\"\nand if a figure is realistic there can practically be no doubt\nas to its sex. Of the remaining 120, although classed as\nincompletely developed, it must not be assumed that the sex\nwas necessarily open to doubt. And even where the uncer\ntainty exists, it seems to have been due, in some cases at\nleast (v., e.g., 268, Miss Egerton's case, \"the impression dis\nappeared instantaneously;\" and 312, Mr. and Mrs. C.'s case\n\u2014a collective one, by the way\u2014\" the figure was too evanescent\nand unrecognisable, and insufficiently defined in outline, to\nidentify \"), as much to the momentary nature of the experi\nence as to the indefiniteness of the figure. The indis\ntinctness of the hallucinations of Visceral Patients cannot be\naccounted for in this way, for they seem to have usually been\nanything but fleeting, and were often persistent and prolonged ;\nand, even supposing that some were but momentary, the quality\nof indefiniteness or haziness attaches to them all without\nexception.\nI. (es). \" The complete flatness and absence of the usual\nundulations of a woman's figure suggest that it may have been\nthat of a man.\"\nThis point is met by the comments on e \\ unless, indeed,\nthe cruel suggestion be advanced that all the female figures\ndescribed as realistic, or recognised as those of female relations\nor friends of Psychical Percipients, were wanting in the \" usual\nundulations.\"\n\fLi.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 283\n\u2022L (.\/)\u2022 \"If the figure was white, most say at once 'It\nwas a corpse.' Curiously, not one of my patients spoke of the\nhallucination as a ghost, possibly owing to the almost entire\nignorance shown by the London-bred population of ghost stories\nor fairy tales.\"\nWith regard to phantasms of the dead (232 first-hand\ncases in all) the Committee reported as follows :\n\" Apparitions of the dead, like other apparitions, usually\nappear dressed like ordinary human beings, and without symbolic\naccompaniments, such as white robes or wings.\nIn four cases it is specially mentioned that the phantom\nappeared in the clothes in which the dead person was buried.\nUsually the appearance in dress or otherwise is what the\npercipient was accustomed to associate with the person in life.\"\n(364-5)\nOf the four cases referred to in the Census Report where\nthe phantom appeared dressed in the clothes in which the\ndead person had been buried, it must not be understood\nthat these clothes were necessarily grave-clothes : for in one\ncase, already referred to (v. I. d), a phantom of his father\ndressed \" en frac \" (i.e. in evening dress clothes) was seen by\nMr. Heintze, who subsequently learned that his father \" avait\nete\" enten-e\" en habit noir (frac).\" (379)\nIn another of these four cases, the apparition was seen\ndressed in grave-clothes (141-2); but this was a memory\nimage rather than a hallucination, the percipient having \" shortly\nbefore \" seen the dead man lying in his coffin and \" the\nsight of the corpse had produced a profound impression \" on\nhim.\nAmong veridical cases of phantasms of the dead I note one\ninstance (372) of the hallucinatory figure taking the form of\na corpse. Except for this the case shows no likeness to the\nVisceral type. The hallucination was coincidental, having\noccurred on the same day as the funeral of the percipient's\nmother, whose death, and even illness, was unknown to her ;\nand the percipient was at the moment engaged in serving\nmaccaroni and milk to her children ; the day was fine and\nhot, the time 1.30 p.m., and consequently the light must have\nbeen strong (v. IV.) ; and the vision was exceptionally complete\nand vivid, and apparently coloured (v. III.).\n\f284 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nDr. Head thinks it curious that his patients never spoke\nof the figures as \" ghosts,\" and attributes this to their ignorance\nof ghost stories or fairy tales. But though they may not\nhave spoken of them as \" ghosts \" they may have thought of\nthem as such ; and that this was the case in at least one\ninstance would appear from the quotation which heads\nSection VIII.\nIn view, too, of the reticence shown by Visceral Patients\n(v. above, p. 268), it is not surprising if they refrained from\nthe use of the word \" ghosts.\" \" Hallucinations \" would sound\nso much better, especially when one was conversing with a\nmedical man, and even such expressions as \" funny experience \"\nor \" funny feelings,\" if less scientific, would recommend them\nselves in preference to \" ghosts \" as likely to excite less\nridicule or less distrust.\nMoreover, S.P.R. percipients do not often, even to sympathetic\nears, use the question-begging and mirth-provoking word\n\" ghosts \" ; and so it does not surprise me that patients drawn\nfrom a class proverbially apprehensive of ridicule did not\nemploy it.\nAgain, the fact that many of the hallucinations repeated\nthemselves (the recurrency being obviously not attributable\nto \" local \" causes) and that they recurred under similar\nconditions of light, time, mood, etc., may have led the\npatients to feel that their experiences were not \" ghosts \"\nof the proper traditional kind.\nI. (g). \"Whatever the form assumed, the figure or face is\nsingle. I have found no instance so far in the sane where\nmore than one face or figure appeared if the patient's eyes\nwere open.

I\nanswered twice, thinking it was my uncle, ' Come in, Uncle\nGeorge, I am awake,' but the third time I recognised the voice\nas that of my mother, who had been dead 16 years. I said,\n' Mamma ! ' She then came round a screen near my bedside\nwith two children in her arms, and placed them in my arms\nand put the bedclothes over them and said, ' Lucy, promise me\nto take care of them, for their mother is just dead.' I said,\n' Yes, Mamma.' She repeated, ' Promise me to take care of\nthem.' I replied, ' Yes, I promise you,' and I added, ' Oh,\nMamma, stay and speak to me, I am so wretched.' She replied,\n' Not yet, my child,' then she seemed to go round the screen\nagain, and I remained, feeling the children to be still in my\narms, and fell asleep.

[PART\ndistinctness with whick the vision was seen is not explicable by\nthe real light.

Shi\nwas not at all alarmed . . . She never had any experience of\nthe kind, or any hallucination at all, before : but since she has\noccasionally felt a hand on her head in trouble.\"\nTactile hallucinations, it should be noted, are not mentioned\namong the experiences of Visceral Patients (v. XVIII.).\nFor other instances of more than one figure, see\n(169) Wife and child: visual only.\n(195-6) Mother and child: visual and auditory (vocal).\n(103) Old woman nursing a child: visual only.\n(412) Ayah and child, \"as if made of plaster of Paris\":\nvisual, auditory, and recurrent.\nIn the last two of the above cases, however, the hallu\ncinations were connected with illness. The percipient of the\nold woman nursing a child himself draws attention to the\nfact that he was at the time suffering from \" nerves \" and\ninsomnia, and that the hallucination was the precursor of a\n\" severe illness.\" The percipient of the ayah and child was\nat the time suffering from \" a long neurotic attack \" which had\nbeen preceded by an attack of bronchitis.\nIn five instances out of the six which I have traced in the\nCensus Report the second figure is that of a child : a curious\nresult, which can hardly be due to chance, and probably arises\nfrom the intimate association of the idea of mother and child,\nor of nurse and child.1\nIn the sixth case (classed as a \"Vision\"), the percipient\nsaw her uncle lying on a sofa and seemingly dying: and at\nthe same time saw her uncle's bearer and her aunt's ayah\npassing each other in going across the room, and apparently\nlooking at her and sighing. The time and the details of\nthe vision coincided very closely with the time and circum\nstances of the death of the uncle, whose illness was unknown\nto the percipient.\nI.

Hut other cases of motionless transparent\napparitions seem to be clearly genuine hallucinations.\"\nTwo such are referred to : one purely subjective, the other\nveridical.\nIn the former (103) the apparition was recurrent nightly,\nand even several times a night during a period of five or six\nweeks ; it was seen always in one particular spot on a\nlanding : it was draped, and the percipient, who was suffering\nfrom overstrung nerves, sorrow and fatigue, speaks of the\n\" horror \" which it caused her. So far, except for the occasion\nand place of perception, the case presents considerable re\nsemblances to the Visceral type ; but there is one mark of\ndifferentiation : the figure was blue (v. III.).\nIn the veridical case (284-6) the only point of resemblance\nto the Visceral type is the absence of movement ; but this\nis perhaps not remarkable, as the figure was seen seated in\na carriage which the percipient was entering ; and in two\nparticulars the divergence is most marked, namely, in the\ndistinctness of the colouring of the face and clothing (v. III.)\nand in the fact of the figure having a beard : \" un menton trea\nmaigre k barbe rare et d'un blond fonce\".\" (v.

G. Piddington. [PART\nafter waking, 294 when awake in bed, 438 when up and\nindoors, and 201 when out of doors.\nBut proportionately more incompletely developed hallucina\ntions occurred at the moment of waking than visual halluci\nnations of any other class. Thus, once again, we find among\nthis special class a closer conformity than in any other to the\nVisceral type of hallucination.\n\"In 38 per cent, of visual, 34 per cent, of auditory, and\n44 per cent, of tactile cases, the percipient was in bed. Con\nsidering what a small part of our lives we generally spend\nawake in bed, the fact that over ^ of the hallucinations occur\nunder these circumstances is certainly remarkable : and the pro\nportion that occurs immediately after waking\u2014about 12 per\ncent, of visual hallucinations\u2014is still more striking.\" (171)\nThe Report then proceeds to discuss why a state of repose\nis favourable to hallucinations : but into this question we\nneed not enter, for, striking though the proportion of hallucina\ntions experienced at the moment of or shortly after waking is,\nit certainly could not be asserted of Census visual hallucinations\nthat they \" usually \" occur under this condition.\nI. (\/)\u2022 \" No sound accompanied the appearance of the hallucina\ntion of vision in any case.\" l\n\" When [the figure] moved no footsteps were heard.\"\nWhether it be true of the generality of hallucinatory figures\nseen by Psychical Percipients that they \" like to noiseless\nphantoms flit \" is a difficult question to decide, owing to the lack\nof positive information in most cases. All that can be asserted\nwith confidence is that sound (and for the moment I am\nleaving out of consideration articulate speech : for which see\nSection I. m.) accompanies the appearance of Psychical phantoms\nin a certain number of cases, and the absence of sound is\ncategorically noted in a very few cases only.\nOut of the 1120 Census cases of visual hallucination\nrecorded at first hand, 912 were visual only, 87 visual and\n\u2022iditory (vocal), 19 visual, auditory (vocal), and tactile, 31\nsual and tactile, 67 visual and auditory (non-vocal), 4\nsual, auditory (non-vocal), and tactile.\n1For an exception to this rule see the heading of Section XVII.\n\fLI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 289\nFor the purposes of our comparison we can eliminate the\n106 hallucinations of which a vocal sound formed an\nelement, because, as we shall see, the hallucinatory figures\nseen by Visceral Patients do not speak (v. I. m), and also\nbecause Visceral auditory hallucinations are never articulate\nvoices (v. IX.).\nConfining ourselves, therefore, to non-vocal sounds, we find\nthat the Census Committee reports as follows regarding them :\n\" There are 71 cases . . . in our collection where a non-vocal\nsound is heard accompanied by a visual hallucination, and in\n56 of these the sound precedes the apparition.\"\nThere are therefore 15 cases in the Census collection in\nwhich a non-vocal sound accompanies (in the strict sense of\nthe word) a hallucination of vision.\nWe may briefly compare with the Visceral type three\ncases where absence of sound was noted :\n\" The shadow of a human form fell on the moonlit floor.\nHalf turning my head J saw a tall woman dressed in white,\nher back to me.

I was in perfect health\nand peace of mind.\" (194)\nHere the only resemblances to the A^isceral type are the\nnoiselessness of the footsteps and the dissipation of the figure\nby movement on the part of the percipient (v. I. \/).\n\" \/ saw the figure quite distinctly ; it made no sound in\nwalking, which did not strike me as at all strange, as it had\nonly a wrapper on, and probably, as I thought, bedroom slippers.\"\n(353-6)\nThe above is an extract from a local apparition case, in\nwhich non-vocal noises were prominent. The phenomena are\nattested by 7 first-hand witnesses, whose experiencss were\non several occasions collective. Although, as described in the\nextract given above, one of the percipients noted that the\nfigure's movement was noiseless, another percipient states that\na sound of footsteps preceded the appearance of the figure,\nwhile another unspecified non-vocal sound succeeded it :\n\" \/ heard what I thought was my grandmother walking about\nthe room. Just as I was going to run past the screen, the\n. . . figure . . . passed me very quickly and went into the\ndressing-room. My first impulse was to follow her, but I heard\nsuch a strange noise in the dressing-room that 1 feared to enter.\"\nI append a quotation from the Census Report bearing\nspecially on the question of audible footsteps :\n\" Non-vocal sounds, such as footsteps, which sometimes precede\nthe seeing of an apparition, may occasionally be real noises. . . .\nBut in some cases the apparition \u2022 is first seen, and then footsteps\nor some other sound apparently caused by it are heard.\" (193)\nI. (k). \" After a variable interval it [the figure] disappears\nwithout movement.\"\n\" Appearance or disappearance by an unrealistic means is\n. rare. . . . Even when a phantom is stationary, it does not\nally either suddenly appear out of empty space, or similarly\n\u2022ish before the percipient's eyes, but is generally seen by the\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head's Gcndstonian Lectures. 291\npercipient on turning his eyes that way, and vanishes, he does\nnot know how, or when he is looking away. There are, however,\ninstances of sudden appearance and disappearance in free space.\"\n(114)\nTwo such instances are quoted in illustration; in one (261-2)\nthe percipient \" simply ceased to see the figure \" ; in the\nother (114) the percipient writes:\u2014\"I looked at it [the figure]\nfor several seconds in surprise, . . . when it suddenly dis\nappeared.\" Neither instance shows any resemblance worth\nmentioning to the Visceral type, and both present very strongly\nmarked divergences from it.\nI. (\/). \"On the appearance of such a hallucination [i.e.\nstationary figure near bed] several male patients, before admission\nto the hospital, sprang out of bed to seize the person whom they\nsupposed to have entered the room. The figure at once dis\nappeared.\"\nIt would appear from the above that in Visceral cases\nmovement, or at least violent movement, on the part of the\npatient dissipates the hallucination. Dr. Head records no\ncase where on movement having being made by a patient the\nhallucination persisted. Evidence is lacking on this point in\nthe great majority of Psychical cases : but instances do occur both\nw.here movement does dissipate and where it does not dissipate\nthe apparition. There are several cases where percipients touch,\nfollow and even run after a hallucinatory figure without their\naction resulting in its immediate dissipation (v. e.g. 133, 192,\n215 and 295.) In one case (118) the percipient put his hand\nthrough the appearance, and, though no tactile sensation was felt,\nhis \" hand went through as it would through water, . . . the clothes\nkept their fold and position (as water keeps its level) making no\nbreak. My hand with the white night-shirt sleeve was wholly\nhid, and when I withdrew it there was no hole left behind.\"\n40 or 50 seconds later the figure slowly disintegrated. There\nis also a case (coincidental) where the percipient performed\nprecisely the same action as some of Dr. Head's patients :\nnamely, springing out of bed ; but the result was different.\n\" \/ lay for a few seconds and then spoke, but getting no\nanswer, jumped out of bed with hands outstretched towards the\nfigure, which, on my approach, retreated to the outer room still\n\f292 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nsmiling with peculiar sweetness. I followed it, and watched it\nvanish through the outer door, which was closed.\" (286)\nIn the following instance the figure disappeared on the\npercipient getting out of bed and touching it. \" She got out\nof bed, and, walking up to the glass, laid her hand on the airFs\nshoulder ; but it passed through empty air, and she found her\nself looking at her own self in the glass.\" (359.) But apart\nfrom the vanishing of the figure on movement by the percipient,\nthis case shows no resemblances to, and many clearly marked\ndifferences from, the Visceral type.\nIn another case (120) (already referred to under I. b) the\nfigure, seen on three different occasions, always vanished when\nthe percipient \" threw \" her \" hands into it.\" This case was\nplaced in the incompletely developed class ; and shows other\npoints of resemblance to the Visceral type, but also some\ndifferences (v. sub. I. b.).\nIn another case (103) Prof. G. \"saw an old woman with red\ncloak, nursing a child in her arms. She sat on a boulder. . . .\nEarly autumn in bright sunny weather. Made several attempts\nto reach her, but she always vanished before I could get close up\nto the stone.\"\nHere, except for the apparent immobility of the figure, its\ndissolving on the near approach of the percipient, and that the\nexperience was followed by \" a severe illness \" (unspecified),\nit will be noticed that the figure was coloured (v.

Once a \"fixed and agonised stare\"\n(preceded, however, by a turning of the head, 260), is spoken\nof ; \" looked me full in the face,\" \" looking straight at my face,\"\n\" looking straight before her,\" \" gazing fixedly,\" \" looked\nintently,\" \"gazing wistfully,\" and similar expressions frequently\noccur.\nGrimacing is not mentioned,1 and an unpleasant expression\nis very rare indeed. On the whole, though there are hardly\ndefinite enough data from which to form an estimate, I am\ninclined to think that while mobility of feature is sometimes\nmet with, immobility is much commoner.\nII. \" Sometimes . . .

' a pair of\neyes looking through, the bars at the foot of the bed.' \"\n\" In one case only the patient saw a hand and arm come round\nthe door. . . .

Specific reference is often made to the colour of the\nclothes or of the face of the apparition : and even where no\nsuch reference is made, there is usually little doubt about the\nvision having been coloured. In one class only, namely, the\nless realistic or imperfectly developed apparitions, is absence\nof colour relatively frequent. \" They are either shadowy,\nvague, transparent, or colourless.\" (50 and 119). Though\neven among this class colour is not necessarily absent: v., e.g.,\na (recurrent) hallucination of the head of a \" red setter dog \"\n(143), \"a semi-transparent figure, dressed in a black hat,\nsurtout, and blue waistcoat\" (119, footnote2), of the \"head and\nshoulders of a man, middle-aged, stout, with iron-grey hair\nand blue eyes\" (116), of the head and shoulders of a woman,\ndescribed by the percipient \" as exactly like a coloured picture\nof her mother\" (123). And a marked example of colour iu\nan incompletely developed apparition is the following (already\nreferred to under I. d):\n\" Je vis dans un petit jour gris qu'on eut dit factice . . .\nune figure A la siUwuette dinoussde, diaphane, plutdt qu'inddcise.\nCette vision dura un instant, pendant Icquel, pourtant, mes yevx\nprirent connaissanee des moindres details de ce visage. . . .

In three cases of\napparitions coinciding with death the pallor of the halluci\nnatory face is spoken of (v. 223-4, 224, 235-6), but here the\npallor forms part of the true information supernormally con\nveyed (see also 217), and none of these cases otherwise\nconforms to the Visceral type.\nFor colour of hair, complexion, and eyes, v. 79 (case of\nan apparition seen in the dark), 358, 352 (a recurrent case),\nand 374. For colour in dress, etc., v. 369, 385, 163 (a\nrecurrent case), 73, 230, 359-361, and 300.\nI have traced no actual reference to the lips : but apart\nfrom the above cases, where the colour of the eyes, hair,\ncheeks, etc., is positively described, the constantly reiterated\nand emphatic statements of numerous percipients as to the\nlifelike character of the features of the phantoms is evidence\nenough that the faces and lips are not pale and bloodless like\nthose of the ghost of literary tradition. On the contrary,\nthe S.P.R. ghost seems to be quite a full-blooded animal.\nIV. \" Hallucinations of vision do not occur in the bright light\nof day. ... In other cases the hallucination appeared in the\nevening when the patient was sitting quietly in a dimly-lighted\nroom.\"\n\" Things seen in actually complete darkness, but with eyes open\u2014\nas the percipient believed\u2014belong to a somewhat different category.\n\f296 J.

On the whole, we have decided that apparitions\nwhich, notwithstanding the darkness, seemed to the percipient to\nbe seen occupying a definite place in his room\u2014standing by his\nbed, for instance\u2014should be classed as genuine hallucinations,\nand that others were to be regarded as probably pseudo-\nhallucinations. The number of apparitions seen in the dark thus\nincluded in our tables is 80.\n\"In 17 of the 80 cases, the figure alone appeared illuminated.\n. . . In 12 other cases out of the 3\u00a3) the room appeared\nilluminated, though it urns really dark.\" (78-9)\n\" Sometimes the seeing of an apparition seems to depend on\nthe presence of light, and this is probably due to suggestion,\n. . . Thus in one case . . . the figure, seen by the light of o\nlamp, disappeared when the lamp VMS turned out. In [a case\nprinted on pp. 385-7] the percipient first heard footsteps, and\ndid not see the apparition till he had struck a light. Again\nin [a case printed on p. 192] the apparition vanished when\nthe light was put out, and was seen again on relighting it\"\n(191)\nApart from the above quotations, which are alone sufficient\nto disprove the existence of any similarity between Visceral\nand Psychical hallucinations so far as the particular condition\nof perception in question is concerned, it may be noted as\nfurther evidence of disparity that no mention of illumination of\nthe room, of the figure seeming to emit light, or of its being\nsurrounded by a luminous halo, is made in Dr. Head's\ndescriptions of the experiences of such of his patients as had\nhallucinations of vision. I append a few quotations picked at\nhazard from cases in the Census Report :\n\" \/ saw it constantly ; it used to come into my room and\nstand by my bed, but I don't remember seeing it once when it\nwas quite dark.\" (348)\n\" \/ constantly saw it, nearly always by daylight ; though once\nI remember seeing it exceedingly distinctly by firelight.\" (351)\n\" The hmirs of appearance have varied, but it has oftene-st\nbeen broad daylight. . . .

If the hallucination is\nfrequently repeated men, as a rule, recover their self-control,\nand ultimately come to look upon the repetition of the halluci\nnation with curiosity.\"\nThe Census Report deals only indirectly with the question\nof fright. So far, however, as we are concerned to compare\nthe emotional states that accompanied the first hallucinations of\nVisceral Patients and of Psychical Percipients, no difficulty\narises, for the large majority of cases of hallucination in\nthe Census collection were unique experiences in the lives of\nthe various percipients.\nFright is often admitted, and even horror ; yet it would\nbe very far from the truth to say of S.P.R. cases that\n\" almost every case felt frightened.\" Not only is fright often\nexpressly denied, but composure or even pleasure is affirmed.\nBut, in any case, I cannot suppose that the presence or\nabsence of fright and of its accompanying physical symptoms\ncould ever serve as a useful differentia between one order\nof hallucination and another. Its absence or presence could\ndo not more than exemplify differences of mental or moral\ntemperament, and though doubtless true that many a Psychical\nPercipient when he saw an apparition\n\"panted hard\nLike 'Hie that feels a nightmare on hia bed,\"\nit would no more go to prove that his hallucination was due to\nvisceral disease than to nightmare.

G. Piddington. [PART\nthat, while most would admit to having felt frightened and\nmany of them to having experienced heart-beating or sweat\ning, or even \" goose-flesh \" during or after the event, a\ncertain proportion would deny that they felt any of these\nthings.\nFrom the quotations from the Census Report given below,\nit would appear that Visceral hallucinations furnish no parallel\n(unless, indeed, Dr. Head failed to observe or to report it)\nto a rare symptom of Psychical hallucination : I mean the\n\" cold shudder \" which is sometimes said to precede the\nhallucination.\nPerhaps this \" cold shudder \" answers more or less to\n\"goose-flesh,\" but, if so, the \"cold shudder\" sometimes precedes\nthe hallucination, whereas the \" goose-flesh \" of Visceral Patients\nalways accompanies it. If, however, it does not, then \"goose-\nflesh \" is not reported in any Census case so far as my\nknowledge goes : and sweating only once, and then only at\nsecond hand (341): but perhaps a natural delicacy would\nhave prevented many from mentioning this symptom in the\nabsence of a direct request for information on the point.\n\" The first [organic] effect to be noticed is the 'feeling of\ncold '\u2014generally described as a ' chill ' or ' cold shudder '\u2014which\nis sometimes reported as accompanying or immediately preceding\nhallucinations. This is so common in magazine stories of appari\ntions that our readers may expect to find it a normal feature\nin the narratives collected by us : it is, however, on the contrary,\nquite an exceptional feature, being only reported in seven cases\n\u2014exclusive of about half-a-dozen cases in which a 'feeling of\ncold breezes' is mentioned.\" (198)\n\" It will be observed that in some of these cases the chill\nis reported as preceding, in others as accompanying or following,\nthe kaUucination. In the latter cases it would seem to be a\nnatural result, on certain physical temperaments, of the emotional\nexcitement\u2014terror, awe, etc., caused by the unusual experience. . . .\nBut where the chill precedes the hallucination, it seems clear that\nthe sensation must be regarded as an incident of the wlu1le\nnervous disturbance of which the hallucination is one effect.\" (200)\nElsewhere (392) the Report says that it was unusual to\nd hallucinations accompanied by an abnormal physical\niition.\n\fLI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 299\nI adjoin a few instances of (a) the absence of fright being\nnoted ; (b) of some unusual physical effect unaccompanied by\nfear ; (c) of feelings incompatible with fright being reported.\n(a.) \" \/ did not feel at all alarmed, but very curious and sur\nprised, and I jumped out of bed, came up behind [the figure],\nand was going to touch her on the shoulder.\" (361)\n\" \/ felt no fear, but the strain of emotion was so great that\nI remember thinking, etc.\" (369).\n\" There was nothing to alarm any one in the apparition.\nIt teas a very gentle, mild-faced old man, and not one bit like\na story-book ghost.\" (351)\n\"\/ lay for a few seconds and then spoke, but getting no\nanswer, jumped out of bed. ... \/ followed it, and watched it\nvanish through the outer' door. ...

For instance, the following case could not\nproperly be used for purposes of comparison, for I do not\nthink that in spite of the grey dress, pale face, black eyes\nand hair, the figure really corresponded to a dark or a\n\u2022 Igure of the Visceral type ; and although the percipient\n\fReview of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 301\nmakes no such statement I should imagine that in spite of\nthe paleness there must have been slight traces of colour\nin the complexion, for otherwise the play of the features,\nthe impression of beauty, and of alternate gaiety and sadness\ncan hardly be explained :\n\" Je vis une personne, dont je ne saurais pas dire le sexe\n(v.

I. b), one\nwas certainly and the other probably dark or black. In the\nfirst case, the \" terror \" of the percipient upon the appearance\nof the \" dark veiled figure \" was \" so great, that \" she \" could\nneither call \" her \" sister . . . nor move hand or foot.\" In\nthe second case, no emotional disturbance is mentioned, and\nthe absence of fright may be inferred from the following\nstatement made by the percipient:\n\" \/ could not recognise the person ; but was so fully awake that\n\/ thought it might be some one with a message to me, and sat\nquietly waiting for it to speak ; this it did not do.\"\n(For a comparison of these two cases with the Visceral type\nsee I. b and XIV).\nIn another \" incompletely developed \" case a percipient sees\n\"two black legs walking towards\" him (122). The percipient\nis silent as to his emotional condition, but the tone of his\nnarrative does not suggest fright.\nIn a case (204-5) already referred to (sub. I. b) two\nsisters experienced extreme terror\u2014a terror so great that\n\f302 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nits effects lasted for a long time afterwards\u2014as the result of\nfour successive and varied uncanny experiences. The experiences\ncomprised a collective tactile hallucination, a collective sense\nof presence, and non-collective but apparently identical\nhallucinations of \"a very vague muffled form or shadow.\"\nThis form was no doubt dark, if not black, and its appearance\ninduced extreme terror in the percipients ; but as pointed\nout below (v. I. 6) this case cannot be brought into line\nwith the Visceral type.\nVII. \"In no case do they [i.e. hallucinations of sight, hearing and\nsmell] appear without the depression having already made its\nappearance, but hallucinations of vision are in no way necessarily\ncontemporaneous with an attack of depression.\"\n\" These [i.e. visual] hallucinations are not uncommonly accom\npanied by the depressed mood.\"\nThe depression to which sane persons suffering from visceral\ndisease are liable is essentially an irrational mood : \" it comes\non in paroxysms without reason,\" says Dr. Head, \" and forces\nthe patient to seek some solitary place.\" And not only is\nthe mood irrational, but even . the patient himself does not\nseek to attribute it to any definite cause.\nSince the depression is not necessarily contemporaneous\nwith a visual hallucination, it is, of course, possible that if the\nreports of Census Percipients had covered a period of some\ndays, weeks or months previous to the occurrence of their\nhallucinations, some traces of the existence of such tits of senseless\ndepression would have been found ; though I am certain that\nsuch traces would have been of the very rarest, both because the\ncharacteristic traits of Psychical hallucinations differ so widely\nand in so many details from those of Visceral hallucinations\nand also because of the rarity of cases where depression con\ntemporaneous with the appearance of a Psychical hallucination\nis mentioned.\nThe following quotations from the Census Report will help\nthe reader to form his own estimate of the frequency of moods\nof depression contemporaneous with the appearance of a hal\nlucinatory figure.\n\" Omitting cases where definite or permanent ill-health has been\nprodiiced, the percipient states himself to have been\u2014at the time\n\fReview of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures, 303\nhe fjcperienced a hallucination\u2014overworked, overstrained, extremely\ntired, in a state of overwrought nerves, or in some similarly\ndescribed condition, in some %5 cases in the present collection. . .\nIn 8 of the 25 cases, a definite caiise of anxiety is mentioned,\nand in 3 others the percipient speaks of himself as worried.\"\n(166)\nDeducting, then, these 8 cases of anxiety attributed to a\ndefinite cause, there remain only 17 cases among which we\ncan look for instances of causeless depression. But even\nof these 17 cases all cannot be treated as affording possible\nexamples of depression, for a deduction must again be made\nto allow for cases of overwork and overstrain, and extreme\nfatigue: expressions which could hardly have been used to\ndescribe depression. There remain, then, only those cases\nwhere the percipients reported themselves as \" in a state of\noverwrought nerves,\" or in some similarly described condition:\nand in this small balance of cases only could we legitimately\nseek for examples of contemporaneous depression. But from the\nfollowing quotation it is clear that cases of depression were\nnot intentionally included by the Committee under the terms\n\" overwrought nerves, or ... some similarly described con\ndition \" :\n\" Taking all hallucinations, whether of sight, hearing, or\ntouch, of which we have first-hand accounts, we find that\nanxiety, more or less grave, about the illness of a relative\nor friend, is stated to have been present, or appears from the\nevidence to have been probably present, in about 89 cases.\nIn 54 other cases, we find 'mention of anxiety, or worry, or\nterious trouble about other subjects than illness\u2014or at least\nnot stated to have been about illness.\n[Practically all these cases may be dismissed, even supposing\nthat \" anxiety \" or \" worry \" be held to include some cases of\ndepression, because a cause is assigned for the depressed state\nof mind.]\nThen there are about 49 cases,1 in which the percipient appears\nto have been in grief, or unhappy (besides some already\ncounted [see above] in which he states himself to have been\nin anxiety, as well as in grief) ; and if we add cases of\n1 In 42 ont of these 49 cases the grief was due to the recent death of a friend.\nU\n\f304 J. G. Piddington. [PART\ndepression (6) and of agitation in various forms (23), we\nget altogether, out of 1622 hallucinations, about 220 cases\nin which emotional disturbance accompanied the hallucination.\nIn 437 cases a positive statement is made that no grief or\nanxiety existed, and there seems to be no reason to suspect\nthe presence of either in the great majority of the cases where\nno answer is made to tke question about emotion, nor any\ninformation given bearing on the subject.\" (168)\nThere were then only 5 instances out of 1622 hallucinations\nof all kinds, or out of 1120 visual hallucinations, where de\npression is categorically said to have been present ; and\neven in these five cases it is not said that the depression\nwas causeless.\nThere are doubtless plenty of cases where depression has\nfollowed on the seeing of an apparition, whose appearance\nwas taken to convey or to forebode news of a depressing nature;\nbut here, of course, both the time relation and the existence\nof a motive distinguish such depression from the depression\nthat precedes or precedes and accompanies the hallucinations\nof Visceral Patients.\nI have not traced in the Census Report any mention\nby a percipient of a fit of apparently motiveless depression\npreceding a visual hallucination, but it would not surprise me\nif examples of this could be found in the Proceedings and\nJournal. For supposing that a message of a depressing char\nacter has in some way reached the consciousness of a percipient\nwith sufficient intensity for its general emotional tenour to be\ncommunicated, but with not enough intensity for the full\nparticulars to be externalised hallucinatorily, during the period\nof incubation or development one may easily conceive that\nthe percipient should be seized with a feeling of vague\ndepression\u2014a depression which would seem meaningless and\nmotiveless until explained by the appearance of the ill-boding\napparition.\nI have, perhaps, laboured this point with unnecessary\nprolixity : but of all the distinguishing features of Visceral\nhallucinations none seems to me more outstanding than this\none ; namely, that they are always preceded by moods of\ndepression. Consequently I have thought it right, even at\nthe risk of tediousness, to enter into as full and detailed a\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 305\ndiscussion as the evidence on this point furnished by the\nnarratives in the Census Report allows.\nVIII. \"These hallucinations are not uncommonly accompanied\nby the depressed mood. ... In such cases the patient is\nconvinced that the appearance is a sign that some ill-fortune has\nhappened, or is about to happen. He believes some near rela\ntive is dead or in trouble, and not infrequently says that the\nfigure was that of some dead relation, e.g. 'my sister.' Asked\nif it resembled his sister he answered, ' Not in the least, but\nI know it must have been my sister, because she is the only\none of my relations who is dead.' \"\nThe latter part of this statement might be paraphrased as\nfollows : \" Recognition of the figure is inferential, not instinc\ntive.\" The large number of cases of unrecognised apparitions\n\u2014315 first-hand cases out of 830 first-hand cases of realistic\napparitions\u2014as well as the large number of apparitions recog\nnised as those of living persons\u2014352 out of 830\u2014shows\nthat there is little tendency among Psychical Percipients to\nassume causelessly that apparitions represent dead or dying\npersons, or subsequently to the experience to identify an\napparition which at the moment of its appearance was un\nrecognised. In other words, there is little tendency to\ninferential recognition. Nor is there any resemblance between\nthe inferential identification of the hallucinatory figures seen\nby Visceral Patients and the few examples of \" deferred recog\nnition \" cited in the Census collection (v., e.g., 128-9, 142-144,\nand 284). In one class of cases only\u2014namely, cases of local\nhaunts\u2014does there appear to be any tendency to read back\ninto the experiences resemblances which were not noted in\nthe first instance.\nThe latter part of the paragraph which heads this section\nagrees with a statement made by the Census Committee :\n\" The most primitive, and still the most widely spread and\ndeeply rooted, conception of apparitions is that they repre\nsent dead persons.\" (389) If this statement of the Com\nmittee be true, it will be noticed that Census Percipients were\nnot unduly influenced by this widely spread and deeply rooted\nconception : a strong tribute to the trustworthiness of their\nevidence on this particular point of recognition of the figures.\n\f306 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nWith regard to the cases of alleged death-coincidences, the\nReport says :\n\" Have we good reason to believe that it [the figure] teas\nrecognised before the death was known, and not merely, having\nbeen unrecognised at the time, assumed afterwards to have\nrepresented the decedent became of the coincidence?\" ... \"Of\nthe . . . kind of error, by which an unrecognised figure is\nafterwards remembered as a recognised one, we have no proved\ninstances ; nor had Mr. Gitrncy when ' Phantasms of the Living '\nwas written. . . . Still, it is an error respecting which we\nought to be on our guard.\" (210-11)\nIt is, of course, true that the appearance of recognised\nfigures is often held by Psychical Percipients to be of evil\nomen : for the very good reason that the figure, by the form\nit assumes, by its speech or gesture, or symbolically, seems\nto convey news of death or misfortune. Sometimes a\nPsychical Percipient after seeing and recognising an appari\ntion, which beyond the mere fact of its appearing has\nnothing about it suggestive of misfortune, does put the same\ngloomy interpretation on the incident as a Visceral Patient.\nBut, without going into other particulars, we can always\n(except, perhaps, in cases of \" deferred recognition,\" where\nwe have to rely on other points of dissimilarity) draw this\nclear line of distinction between the experiences of the two,\nthat, while the Visceral Patient only \" recognises \" his appari\ntion as a result of subsequent reflexion, the Psychical\nPercipient recognises his apparition instantaneously and\ninstinctively.\nAUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS.\nIX. \" Hallucinations of hearing, occurring in sane persons\nsuffering from visceral disease, are never articulate voices.\"\nNeither in the Society's general collection nor in the Census\nis account taken of non-vocal or inarticulate hallucinations of\nng unless they happen to form part of a bisensory\nucination, or unless they occur among a series of\ncinations affecting other senses.\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 307\nThe hallucinations of Visceral Patients are only very rarely,\nif ever, bisensory ; and we have already seen (v. I. \/) that\ntheir visual hallucinations are not accompanied by sound ;\nand we now learn that their auditory hallucinations are never\narticulate.\nSeeing that the hallucinations of Psychical Percipients are\nfrequently articulate, frequently preceded and sometimes\naccompanied by sound, and are often bisensory, it is clear\nthat very broad lines of cleavage divide the one order of\nhallucinatory phenomena from the other.\nIt may seem, therefore, a work of supererogation to pursue\nthe comparison further ; but I am led to do so for the following\nreasons :\nThe diversity between the two is brought out much more\nforcibly by entering into detail than by merely contrasting, as\nabove, the broad features of each.\nMoreover, both the Census Report and the publications of\nthe Society generally do contain records of isolated nou-vocal\nsounds supposed to be hallucinatory, when these sounds form\npart of a series of hallucinations of a different form. Instances\nare to be found chiefly in cases of ' Haunted Houses.' These\nisolated non-vocal hallucinations of Psychical Percipients I\npropose, then, to compare with the equally isolated and equally\nnon-vocal hallucinations of persons suffering from visceral\ndisease.\nMy last reason is less obvious, and needs some pre\nliminary explanation.\nDr. Head says in one place (v. I. j) that \" no sound\naccompanied the appearance of the hallucination of vision in\nany case.\" From a subsequent passage in his treatise (v.\nXVII.) it appears, however, that this statement needs qualifica\ntion, though Dr. Head himself does not make the qualification\nand seems to be unaware of the need of it.\nThe passage runs as follows : \" It is uncommon to find\ntwo hallucinations occurring together at the same moment.\nOne patient told me she heard tapping at an upstairs window\nand, looking, saw a white face.\"\nA few Visceral hallucinations of vision, then, are \" accom\npanied \" by a non-vocal sound, and are at any rate primA\nfacie bisensory.\n\f308 J.

But as a matter of fact it seems to me to be\nmore likely that in this case the sound preceded than that\nit accompanied the apparition. If this really was so, then\nthe case resembles in this respect a considerable number\nof Census cases, classed as \"bisensory,\" where a non-vocal sound\npreceded a visual hallucination. But they were put into this\nclass chiefly because the percipients thought the sound to be\nhallucinatory, the Committee themselves thinking it probable\nthat in many cases the sounds were real sounds, due to\nunexplained causes, and not hallucinatory at all ; and that\nthese real sounds provoked the subsequent hallucinations of\nvision.\nIn the same way the tapping at the upstairs window\nmay have been a real sound, and may have provoked the\napparition of the white face ; for we have no proof that\nVisceral Patients are not as liable to the effects of suggestion\nas other people.1\nIn various passages throughout this review I contrast\nthe rarity of bisensory hallucinations among Visceral Patients\nwith their comparative frequency among Psychical Percipients,\nand claim that herein lies a broad differentiation between\nthe two.\nBut if we find, first, that bisensory hallucinations do occur\namong Visceral Patients, and, secondly, that in the only\nexample of them which Dr. Head quotes the auditory part of\nthe compound hallucination seems to have preceded the appari\ntion and thus to resemble a large number of very doubtfully\nbisensory cases contained in the Census, it follows that\n\" bisensoriness \" alone, when the auditory part is non-vocal\nand precedes the visual part of the hallucination, is no\nlonger in itself a sufficient mark of differentiation. Differences\nmust therefore be looked for in other directions ; and this I\npropose to do in the following sections.\n1In Section XVIII., however, I point out that such evidence as there is\ntends to show that Visceral Patients are less susceptible to suggestion than the\nordinary run of people.\n\fli] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 309\nX. \"Amongst [Dr. Head's] cases the hallucinations assumed\nthe form of tapping or knocking (eleven cases), the sound of one\nor more bells (seven cases), a low whistling sound (one case), a\nsound like treading or heavy footsteps (one case), and a sort of\nbreathing or inarticulate whispering (one case).\"\nIn Census cases where an auditory hallucination immediately\npreceded a visual or tactile hallucination, we find the follow\ning forms :\nA percipient \" was sitting at tea talking with his wife when\nhe heard a distinct knocking at the window. He . . . turned\nround and saw his grandmother. He saw her face quite\nclearly\u2014 in the bonnet and cape that she used to wear, and\nsaw her hand in the attitude of having just tapped at the\nwindow. . . .

I saw an\nindividual, a man who was once my master, and he said :\n' Well, Agnes, how are you?' ' Oh, it's Mr. Middleton.' He\nthen vanished. [I was] sitting talking to my husband, in\ngood health. . . . My husband saw nothing, but heard the\nknocking.\"\nThis percipient had \" never had any other hallucinations\nof sight, but a week or two after this, she and her husband\nused to hear constant knockings or hammerings at night.\"\n(370-1)\n\f310 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nThe first experience took place 6 days before the wife's\nconfinement. The second experience, auditory (non-vocal) only\nand shared by the husband, who had likewise shared in the\n(non-vocal) auditory part of the first, occurred within a week\nor two of the husband's sudden death. It will be noted that\nin the first hallucination there was first a non-vocal and\nafterwards a vocal hallucination. The apparition of the figure\npreceded the percipient's reception of the news of the death\nof Mr. Middleton by less than 20 hours.\n\" \/ had just put out the candle when footsteps were heard\nin the adjacent room\u2014a sound of slippers shuffling, I might\nsay.\" (385)\nThe visual hallucination that followed shows the following\ndivergences from the Visceral type :\nVariety of colours in dress of figure. Percipient \" not\nfrightened \" and fell asleep with a \" sense of joy.\" The figure\nspoke and moved, and made two distinct gestures. The hallu\ncination was tri-sensory\u2014auditory (non-vocal and vocal), visual\nand tactile ; and was seen by the light of a sulphur match.\nThe experience was not collective, but the same figure\nappeared on the same night to a second person, and spoke\nwords of the same purport as to the first percipient.\nI next give a resumt of a local apparition case where though\nnon-vocal sounds did precede they did not by any means\nimmediately precede the usual hallucination.\nAccording to the first-hand account of the percipient she was\nawakened . . . by a tremendous noise apparently in tlie nezt\nsuite of rooms, as if some huge iron boxes ami other heavy things\nwere being thrown about with great force. This continued about\nhalf-an-hour, and was followed first by a noise as if the fire in\na room underneath were being violently poked and raked for\nsome minutes, and then by a most terrible and distressing cough\ning of a man. The same things went on at night during the\nrest of her week's visit.\nOn a second visit to the haunted house a year later tfie\nsame percipient heard a very noisy martial footstep ascending\nthe stairs, and then marching quickly up and down the\ncorridor outside her room. Then violent coughing, and after\nwards the footsteps again.\nSome nights later she saw a long, very thin, very dark\n\fLi.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 311\nblack figure bending over a Bible. The figure, apparently\ndisturbed, though not dissipated, by movement on the per\ncipient's part (v. I. I), suddenly darted up, jumped off the\nivindow-ledge, on to the wash-stand, and thence to the ground,\nand flitted quickly across the room, in the direction of a table\non which were a lot of bangles and rings. The percipient\nthen heard a slight jingle as if some one were feeling quietly\nher bangles and rings (341-3).\nIf Dr. Head's theory that the form of the hallucinations of\nVisceral Patients depends on the position of the headache be\ncorrect, it is only to be expected (as, indeed, nearly always\nseems to be the case) that a considerable interval should\nelapse between the occurrence of a hallucination of hearing\nand of a hallucination of vision. So we might expect\nto find in such a case as this last one, where a long interval\nelapsed between the first hallucination of hearing and the\nsubsequent hallucination of sight, to find a closer resemblance\nto the Visceral type than in the foregoing cases where the\nvisual immediately followed the auditory hallucination. So far,\nhowever, from there being any closer resemblance, the differences\nare quite as marked, as the following considerations show.\nExcept for one tactile and visual hallucination some three\nyears previously, the percipient had experienced no other halluci\nnations, and these were her only auditory hallucinations, and\nthey all occurred in the same house, and that a house which\nshe visited only at intervals. According to the percipient's\nown account, the regular inmates of the house constantly\nheard similar sounds. Once a similar figure had been seen,\nand at least on one occasion a second person had heard the\nsame strange noises as herself. The auditory hallucinations\nwere at first unaccompanied by a visual hallucination, and\nwhen the figure did appear it was not preceded but followed\nby an auditory (non-vocal) hallucination. On the occasion\nof the first manifestation of the noises the percipient expressly\nstates that she \" did not feel a bit scared \" (v. XIII.) : nor\napparently was she on subsequent occasions. The figure,\nthough very black, and though it did not speak (I. TO), was\nanything but stationary (v. I. h) : and the experience was\nsimultaneously bisensory on one occasion, namely, when the\nfigure was seen and the jingling was heard.\n\f312 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nThere are two instances only in the Census Report which\nfurnish a strictly parallel phenomenon to the auditory halluci\nnations of Visceral Patients. The first case was not included\nin the Census statistics because the sounds, though vocal,\nwere not articulate, and because no other sense than that\nof hearing was affected : but it was printed in the Report\nbecause \" the impression was a perfectly definite one, and\nunique in the experience of the percipient,\" and because the\nevidence for a telepathic origin seemed strong.\nThe percipient living in Dunbar heard one evening about\n10 p.m., while preparing to go to bed, some one sobbing.\nAfter satisfying herself that the sobbing did not proceed\nfrom any one in the house, she at once thought there must\nbe something the matter with her greatest friend who at the\ntime was living in Lincolnshire. She wrote three days later\nto ask her friend if on the night in question she had been\ncrying.\nThe friend replied that she had been crying on account of\npain caused by toothache : and had thought of the percipient,\nand wished intensely that she was with her. (291)\nEvidentially the coincidence is well-established : and the\npercipient had never had a similar experience.\nThe second instance crops up incidentally among informa\ntion supplied by a percipient who had had already sent an\naccount of a coincidental articulate hallucination of hearing\nwhich he had experienced collectively with his father and\ncousin.\n\" Mr. Cary further informs us that he has had no other\nhallucinations except the hearing of footsteps. He heard them\nfirst in 1879 [i.e. four years after his articulate hallucination]\nand his brother died shortly after. He did not then know\nthat such sounds were regarded as premonitory of a death.\nHe has heard them twice since, and on each occasion a cousin\nof his died. His father also had heard them more than\nonce, and each time lost a brother.\" (316)\nThe evidence is of course sadly lacking in detail : but the\nobject of the enquiries addressed by the Committee to the\npercipient was not to obtain evidence of coincidence between\nnon-vocal hallucinations and deaths, but to ascertain the extent\nof the percipient's susceptibility to auditory hallucination.\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 313\nIn conclusion I quote one specimen each of cases %vhere\nnon-vocal hallucinations were followed and perhaps accom\npanied by a hallucination of some other sense than that of\nsight.\nA percipient lying in bed convalescent from, an attack of\nscarlet rash, unaccompanied, however, by fever or derange\nment of consciousness, felt her bed shaken under her, and\nheard a gurgling noise, and a distinct cry for help. (269)\nIt will be noticed that unlike the cases observed by Dr.\nHead the inarticulate auditory hallucination was preceded by\na tactile hallucination.\nThe hallucination coincided very closely in time with the\ndeath by drowning of a cousin.\nNon-vocal noises play a considerable part in the alleged\nphenomena of haunted houses : but in many cases there is\nvery little reason to attribute them to any but ordinary\ncauses, even where they are followed by undoubted halluci\nnations of vision (v. 180, and 340).\nIn one case (346-9), however, a collective visual halluci\nnation (perhaps collectively auditory (non-vocal) also) preceded\nby a few days a collective auditory (non-vocal) and visual\nhallucination, and was later on followed by a series of\nnon-vocal hallucinations. The figure first seen does not con\nform to the Visceral type ; for, apart from its having been\nseen collectively, its sex was recognised (\u00ab. I. e) ; it was\nnot stationary, it walked downstairs (v. I. h); its dress rustled\n{I. j), and its clothes contained colour (v. III.) ; and it appeared\nduring \" a bright summer afternoon \" (v. IV.). A few days\nlater, during a meal, all the members of the family heard\nthe latch of a door lifted and saw a shadow go quickly up\nthe stairs. Subsequently non-articulate noises of various kinds\nwere heard either collectively or singly by members of the\nfamily during a considerable period of time. They are\ndescribed as follows:\n\" The noises in the house were at times almost unbearable\u2014\nexactly as though half-a-ton of coals had been shot down the\nstairs. Mother never act.ually saw the old woman, though she\nconstantly followed tlie sound of the footsteps up the stairs\nto try and discover what it could be ; and once . . . she heard\nit come downstairs, and made up her mind she would look ;\n\f314 J. G. Piddington. [PART\n~\nbut directly the door began to open she covered her face,\nand distinctly heard it come all round the room and go\nout leaving the door open.\" (346-9)\nEventually the father while suffering from \" one of his\nfavourite bilious attacks heard some one coming, and in\nwalked the old woman.\" This was the last straw, and the\nfamily left the house : and the next inmates are said to\nhave left after a short stay on account of the \" awful\nnoises.\"\nThe collectivity of these hallucinations of hearing is alone\nsufficient to distinguish them from the non-vocal auditory\nhallucinations of Visceral Patients; and, as another broad dis\ntinction, I note that the non-vocal sounds heard by Psychical\nPercipients are much more varied in character and are also\nperhaps more violent than the sounds heard by Visceral Patients.\nThe former frequently hear several different kinds of noises\ntogether or in rapid succession, whereas the latter appear to\nhear only one kind of noise at a time.\nXI. \" These hallucinations usually occur at night. But as it\nis only necessary for their appearance that disturbing noises\nshould be absent, they may occur during the day if the patient\nis in a quiet place ; for as light was found to be a disturbing\nfactor in the case of visual hallucinations, so external noise\nseems to prevent the appearance of auditory hallucinations.\"\nLight is emphatically not a disturbing factor in the case of\nPsychical visual hallucinations, and so we might expect that\nexternal noises would not check the development of Psychical\nauditory hallucinations.\nBut the question is not so simple as in the case of visual\nhallucinations, and a clear and categorical answer cannot be\nmade to it. And this for various reasons.\nIn the first place it is a much easier matter to distinguish\na visual hallucination from a visual illusion than it is to dis\ntinguish an auditory hallucination from an auditory illusion.\nIn the second place, there is an absolute lack of direct\nevidence with regard to the absence or presence of external\nnoise at the moment of the occurrence of auditory hallucina-\nions ; and in only a few cases can the acoustic conditions be\n\fLI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 315\nIn the third place, even if direct evidence on this point\nwere given by percipients, it would in many cases be open to\nsuspicion. A person may easily be conscious of more than\none visual impression simultaneously, but unless a special\neffort be made to observe accurately, I think our ordinary\nexperience is that though we may have been conscious at a\ngiven moment of more than one sound, when we cross-examine\nour memory afterwards one sound has survived to the exclusion\nof all others ; not necessarily the loudest, but the one which\nhad most interest for us. The spontaneity of auditory\nhallucinations makes it extremely unlikely that any one at\nthe moment of experiencing them would make that special\neffort at accurate contemporaneous observation which I\nimagine is necessary in order to ascertain if more than one\nsound were audible at a given time.\nThese considerations lead me to question how much reliance\ncan be placed on Dr. Head's statement, cautiously and some\nwhat vaguely expressed though it be, that \" external noise\nseems to prevent the appearance of auditory hallucinations.\"\nI fancy that a safer, though far more awkwardly expressed,\nstatement might run somewhat in this fashion : If sounds,\nclaimed to be hallucinatory, occur under conditions when it\nis known or suspected that external noises were being or\ncould have been simultaneously heard by the percipient, the\nchances in favour of the sounds having been real sounds\nmisinterpreted are largely increased. Hence sounds claimed\nas hallucinatory which occur at night or at other quiet times\nare more likely than sounds occurring in daytime to be\naccepted as hallucinatory not only by the hearer but by the\ncritic*\nI have called Dr. Head's statement somewhat vague, for he\nspeaks of \" external noise \" without explaining whether any\ndegree, however small, of external noise is sufficient to prevent\nan auditory hallucination, or whether its intensity matters.\nWould, for instance, a Visceral Patient, whose nights were\npassed within earshot of an electric-light generating station,\nbe preserved from auditory hallucinations by the monotonous\nwhirr of the engines ?\nThe Census Committee believed that \" a state of repose\nis favourable to hallucinations.\" \" We find,\" they write, \"...\n\f.\n316 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nthat in 38 per cent, of visual, 34 per cent, of auditory, and\n44 P&r cent, of tactile cases, the percipient was in bed, or\n(in a very few cases) had been sleeping in his chair or\nelsewhere.\n\" Considering what a small part of our lives we generally\nspend awake in bed, the fact that over $ of the hallucinations\noccur under these circumstances is certainly remarkable, and\nthe proportion that occurs immediately after waking\u2014about\n12 per cent, of visual hallucinations\u2014is still more striking.\"\n(171)\nIf, then, we do not press Dr. Head's words \" external\nnoise seems to prevent the appearance of auditory hallucina\ntions \" too closely, we may say that much the same conditions\nfavour the development of auditory hallucinations in the case\nof Visceral Patients as in the case of Psychical Percipients ;\nor rather, perhaps, a state of repose favours not so much the\ndevelopment as the recognition by percipient or psychologist,\npatient or physician, of certain sounds as hallucinatory.\nIf we turn now to the Census Report, we shall find that\nneither a state of repose nor absence of external noise\nnecessarily prevents the hearing of hallucinatory sounds, or at\nleast of sounds supposed by their hearers to be hallucinatory.\nFor the purpose of elucidating this particular point I include\nPsychical cases of articulate hallucinations of hearing ; though\nit must be borne in mind that, strictly speaking, by the very\nfact of their articulateness they are differentiated from the\ninarticulate hallucinations of Visceral Patients.\nThe first case serves incidentally to illustrate the doubt\nthat a percipient himself may feel as to the genuinely\nhallucinatory character of an experience occurring amid noises\nindubitably external.\n\" \/ was a captain in the staff of the army at the siege\nof Delhi, in 1857; and, among other duties, often carried\norders and messages for the general in command.\n\" On one occasion I was sent by the general with some\nmessage or orders for Sir Charles Reid, who commanded all\nour advanced posts along the well-known ' ridge.'\n\"He was not at his headquarters, but had gone towards\nextreme right and most exposed part of the ridge, so,\n'ng my horse under cover, I proceeded on foot along\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head!8 Goulstonian Lectures. 317\ntlie road towards the 'right battery.'

As I approached\nthe officers, among whom I expected to find Sir C. Reid, one\nof them remarked on the narrow escape I had just had : but,\non my asking why they had called out to me, I was told to my\nutter surprise, that no one had done so ! \/ heard the summons,\nhowever, which saved my life ; and whether I fancied that\nsome other of the many sound* in the air at the time was\nmy somewhat peculiar name, or whether the call to me at\nthat fortunate moment was a ' spirit voice,' as one, of my\nfriends at once pronounced it, or was altogether the product\nof my own imagination : the facts remain that I heard, or\ntkought I heard, an unrecognised voice summon me from\nthe road ; that by obeying the summons I escaped death, or\nat any rate very serious wounding ; and that no human\nbeing had so called out to me!\" (337)\nIf this was a real hallucination, it would be difficult to\nimagine stronger evidence of its having been accompanied by\nexternal noise.\nThe Report refers to, but does not quote, a case where a\npercipient states that she heard a voice saying, \" cross the\nroad,\" just before a runaway horse came round the corner\n(337). Here an obvious explanation suggests itself: namely,\nthat the noise made by the runaway horse was subconsciously\nheard by the percipient and gave rise to the hallucination :\na phenomenon not to be confused with the misinterpretation of\nan external sound. But, whatever the cause may have been,\nthe hallucination, if such it was, can hardly not have been\naccompanied by external noise.\nAs regards non-vocal cases, one case of coincidental sobbing\nalready referred to (v. X., p. 312) illustrates the difficulty of\ndetermining the acoustic conditions accompanying a hallucination\nof hearing. The percipient was \" preparing to go to bed \" :\nand at least two other inmates of the house were still up,\n\f~\n318 J. G. Piddington. [PART\none of whom came into the percipient's room just after she had\nheard the sobs. It is conceivable, of course, that at the precise\nmoment when the hallucination occurred a temporary silence\nmay have reigned throughout the house, but it appears more\nlikely that external noise cannot have been wholly absent.\nFor other instances we must have recourse to cases of local\napparitions, of which, says the Report, \" one of the most\ncommonly reported features ... is the frequent occurrence\nof alarmmg and unaccountable noises in the house.\" These\nnoises, the Report states, \" are generally, though not invari\nably, reported to be heard at night.\"\nIn a case already referred to (v. X., p. 313) a family are\nseated at dinner, when apparently all and certainly most of\nthem heard the lifting of the latch of a door leading into the\ngarden, and several of them thereupon saw the door open,\nand a shadow go quickly upstairs.\nWhen a family, especially one comprising several children\u2014\nas did this one\u2014is at dinner, it would be almost miraculous\nif external noise were absent. But though other previous\nand subsequent experiences in the same house were, un\ndoubtedly, hallucinatory, it does not necessarily follow that\nthe sound of the door-latch was, for it may possibly have\nbeen a real sound, which provoked the visual hallucination\nand the subsequent hallucinations of hearing ; though if it\nwere so, the family must have had a strong family suscepti\nbility to suggestion. A similar ambiguity presents itself in\nanother Haunted House case, where one of the percipients\nwrites :\n\" Chief, when we were all working in the room . . . toe\ndistinctly heard knocking at the door, and on calling out ' come\nin' there was no response.\" (353)\nExternal noise must almost certainly have been going on, but\nwas the knocking hallucinatory, and would it have been given a\nsecond thought except for the visual hallucinations which had\npreceded and which followed it ? Still, although when taken by\nitself such a phenomenon as this knocking has little chance\nof being accepted as hallucinatory, when other alleged pheno\nmena reported by other percipients in the same case are\ntaken into consideration, there seems to me to be strong\nunds for regarding not only the knocking but also the\n\fReview of Dr. Head's Gowlstonian Lectures. 319\nother mysterious noises which formed a prominent feature\nof the hauntings as hallucinatory. Thus the percipient quoted\nabove writes :\n\" 1 continually heard the. most real and awful groans and\n\u2022various sorts of noises, which could not be accounted for in any\n\u2022way. . . .\" And again : \" The apparition was generally seen in\nor near Mr. S.'s bedroom and dressing room, where also\nmysterious noises\u2014whinings, voices and taps\u2014icere often heard\nby several members of the household.\"\nI quote below the strongest evidence to be found in the\nCensus Report for the perception of an auditory hallucination\nduring the occurrence of external noise.\n\" 1 went with my mother into his room at about three\no'clock in the afternoon, and as we opened the wardrobe\ndoor, we heard the most appalling noise. The only thing\nI can at all compare it to is the letting loose of a quantity\nof clock machinery, and yet that doesn't describe it, and it\n-was more violent, while it lasted, which was about half a\nminute : we clung together in terror, and then we looked\neverywhere for an explanation, but could find none, and\nnever have. No one else in the house heard it, though it was\nso loud, and we never heard it again.\" (353-4)\nXII. (a) \"The feeling-tone that accompanies these auditory\nhallucinations varies greatly in intensity, but is almost invari\nably unpleasant. Two patients only described their hallucina\ntions as pleasant.\"\nThe above probably holds good in Psychical cases, at least\nin non-vocal hallucinations. That the feeling-tone should be\nalmost invariably unpleasant stands to reason, for any sound\n\u2014whether ultimately regarded as hallucinatory or not\u2014of\nwhich the cause remains unexplained, is much more likely\nthan not to give rise to an uncomfortable feeling of insecurity\nor uncanniness, particularly if heard in the dark or at night.\nRare instances, however, do occur (v., e.g., Phantasms of the\nLiving, vol. ii., 220-3, and 639-41, and S.P.R. Journal,\nvol. ix., pp. 88-90) where non-vocal hallucinatory sounds\nare said to have produced an agreeable effect: or where it\nmay be inferred that the effect must have been pleasing,\nalthough not directly stated to have been so: v., e.g., (162)\n\f320 J. G. Piddington. [part\na case of an auditory hallucination of \" elaborate music being\nplayed.\"\n(6) \" The intensity of such hallucinations of hearing is very\nvariable. Sometimes they consist of a continuous sound suci\nas a whistle, sometimes of a series of sounds of equal intensity\n(knocking and tapping). Sometimes the sound begins softly and\nworks up to a bang, or it may even rise and fall in intensity.''\nExamples of all the above varieties of sounds are to be\nfound among Fsychical cases of non-vocal auditory hallucina\ntion.\n(c) \" In all cases these sounds have a curious insistent\nquality. The patient is unable to listen to anything else unless\nhe be directly spoken to, nor can he distract his attention from\nthe sound as it would have been possible had it not been\nhallucinatory.\"\nOn this point lack of evidence makes it impossible to\nsay whether similar symptoms obtain in the case of Psychical\nPercipients. In 62 per cent, of Psychical visual hallucina\ntions the percipient was alone, and, though no analysis was\nmade of auditory hallucinations in order to discover the con\ndition of the percipient in respect of solitude, the Report\nstates that 34 per cent, of them occurred when the percipient\nwas in bed, and in a very large proportion of these cases it\nis probable that the percipient was alone. Few opportunities\nwould therefore present themselves of testing whether a\nPsychical Percipient is unable to \" listen to anything else\nunless directly spoken to,\" or whether he can distract his\nattention from the hallucinatory sound : and rarer still would\nbe the occasions on which such an opportunity would be\nseized ; and even if the experiment were attempted it would\nremain doubtful whether the termination of the halluciua-\ntion was brought about by the intrusion of nn objective\nsound, or whether the termination of the one merely coin\ncided with the beginning of the other. The nearest approach\nto a parallel that I can find in the Census Peport occurs in\nthe case of Mr. Mamtchitch, whose experiences have alreadr\nbeen referred to above. He writes: \" Chaque fois, en voyant\nPalladia inopineinent, je perds la parole, je sens du froid\ndans le dos, je palis, je m'ecrie faiblement, et ma respira\n\fLI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 321\ntion s'arrete (c'est ce que me disent ceux qui par hasard\nm'ont observe\" pendant ce moment).\" But here the hallucina\ntions, which recurred frequently, were with two exceptions\nvisual only.\nXIII. \" The patient is usually frightened, and this fear is\nusually associated with sweating, with ' beating ' of the heart,\nand ' goose-flesh.' One very intelligent patient told me she\nwas much more frightened by the tapping on the wall than if\nit had been real tapping.\"\nThe Psychical Percipient of a non-vocal auditory hallucina\ntion is also usually frightened, though not always (v. e.g. 341),\na good deal no doubt depending on the impressionability of\nhis temperament and on his physical condition at the time.\nHis fright, too, at least in some cases, is associated with some\nof the usual physical concomitants. But I do not believe\nthat fright or its physical concomitants are typical symptoms\nof either Psychical or Visceral auditory hallucinations : and\nthey would be equally found to occur in a large proportion\nof cases where people hear real sounds which they cannot\nexplain or which they suspect of being indicative of the action\nor presence of some unwelcome person, animal, or thing : e.g.\nof a burglar, a madman, of a rat or cat, or of a fire.\nTHE MENTAL CHANGES IN GENERAL.\nXIV. \" These mental changes are recognised by the patients\nthemselves, and in some cases are associated by them with\nthe first appearance or progress of their disease.\"\nThe Census Committee, after cutting out a certain number\n(23) of experiences which occurred during diseases known to\nbe associated with hallucination, felt bound, in view of the\nnumerical comparison to be made of seemingly veridical with\npurely subjective cases, to retain in their statistical tables\n123 cases of hallucination experienced by persons suffering\nfrom some form of illness with which hallucination was not\nat the time known to be associated.\nIn 21 out of these 123 retained cases \" the percipient was\nin a state of convalescence after some illness\u2014the nature of\n\f322 J. 0.

Yet neither hallucination, as will be\nseen, conforms to the Visceral type, doubtless because neither\nheralded the approach of a disease of visceral origin.\nProfessor G. \" saw an old woman with red cloak, nursing\na child in her arms.\" The figure was seen out of doors in\nbright sunny weather.

Each hallucination occurred when the percipient\nwas suffering from slight attacks of insomnia, due to over\nwork ; and he notes that in each case \" a severe illness\nfollowed.\" (103)\nMrs. 1). from a child was subject to hallucinations of\nvarious kinds, visual and auditory : and she noted that there\nwas a distinct connection between their appearance and\ntrouble of some sort at the nervous centres. Most of her\nexperiences took place during severe attacks of \" neuralgia\nin the right side of the head,\" \" acute pain in the temple,\"\nor \" neuralgia in the hip and knee.\" Once, however, when\napparently not suffering from any of these attacks of pain,\nshe experienced a recurrent hallucination which she associated\nwith the oncoming of an infectious disease, and which she\nthus describes :\n\" At a later period I was nursing a member of my\nfamily suffering from an infectious disease, the course of\nwhich had already taken a favourable turn, -when, on going\nto the bedroom early one morning, I saw a large half-bred\nblack retriever sitting in an angle of the stairs. I sent a\nservant down and ascertained there was no dog there, but\ncontinued to see it; and at last it became a fear to me to\npass the landing from which I saw it, and I avoided going\ndown the stairs. During the visitations of the black dog, it\nwas always visible in the corner of the stairs ivhenever I\nlooked at the place. It never changed its position; and in\nthe end, one night, feeling very ill, I fainted on the stairs,\nhaving sickened with the same disease. I had noted the day\n\fLi.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 323\non which the apparition of the dog began; it was between\nfour and Jive days after, according to the usual calculation,\nI had begun to sicken with the malady. The duration of\nthis hallucination distinguishes it from others which I have\nhad when seriously ill, and which may have been of the\nnature of delirium, and which I will not, therefore, recapitu\nlate here.\" (409)\nXV. Recurrence is a marked characteristic of the halluci\nnations experienced by patients suffering from visceral disease.\nDr. Head does not quote statistics, but that such is the case\nappears clearly, not only from several passages in the lectures,\nbut also from the detailed reports of cases given in the Appendix.\nDr. Head does not state whether recurrence is the more marked\nin auditory or in visual cases.1\nUsing the term in the same sense as it is employed in the\nCensus Report I mean by recurrence, not that the patient is\nsubject to successive and miscellaneous hallucinations affecting\ndifferent senses, but to repeated hallucinations of the same\nsense, the percepts, if not remaining entirely unchanged, at\nleast manifesting a general resemblance to each other.\nRecurrent hallucinations, as will be seen from the appended\nquotations, are experienced by Psychical Percipients ; but so\nfar as I can judge, they are nothing like so common as among\nVisceral Patients. I think it would be fair to say that whereas\nrecurrence is the rule in Visceral cases it is the exception in\nPsychical cases. It is further interesting to note, in view of\nDr. Head's observations, that the recurrence of hallucinations\nwas found by the Census Committee to be especially marked\nin cases occurring during ill-health.\nThat the connection between recurrence and ill-health was\nless marked in the auditory cases contained in the Census\ncollection may have been due to the exclusion from it of\npurely non-vocal auditory hallucinations.\ni Dr. Head tells me that it is a difficult matter to state the amount of\nrecurrence except in a very general way. The detailed record of cases contained\nin the Appendix to Dr. Head's lectures had led me to suppose that in a\nconsiderable number of cases a hallucination might recur 10 or 20 times. I\ngather from a conversation with Dr. Head that this is by no means an over\nestimate, and that in many cases the hallucinations could be reckoned by\nthe score, and even in a few cases by the hundred.\n\f324 J. G. Piddington. [PART\n\" When several hallucinations are experienced by the same\npercipient they are in some cases scattered throughout his\nwhole life, or a long period of it, and in others, even when\nnumerous, they are confined to a comparatively short period.\n[References to specimen cases here follow. The two instances\ngiven of recurrence confined to a short period of time both\ndiffer from the Visceral type]. . . Again, while in most cases\nthe successive hallucinations are apparently quite miscel\nlaneous, in others they show a more or less marked tendency\nto repeat themselves, the same hallucination occurring again\nand again.\"\n\" We find 71 cases of this kind of recurrence in visual\nhallucinations. By \" recurrence \" we do not mean necessarily\nan exact reproduction, but that the general resemblance is\nenough to make the percipient regard the successive halluci\nnations as representing the same person or thing, or,\nin the case of animals, the same species of animal. Thus\nin [a case numbered 37'13] the percipient was wakened\nby clothes falling off her bed, and saw a figure in profile,\nwith a lilac print dress and white apron, standing at the\nother end of the room. On another occasion she was wakened\nby feeling her hand clutched, and saw a figure of a woman\nin a similar costume facing her. Here the general resemblance\nwas enough to make the percipient regard the figures as\nrepresenting the same person. [Note how the colour (v. III.)\nin the first experience, and the tactile hallucination (v. XVIII.)\npreceding the visual in the second, distinguish these cases\nfrom the Visceral type.] \" Again, [in a case numbered 280'20]\nthe percipient saw the face of his brother in a wide-awake\nhat look in at the door of his room in the evening. The\nsame night he woke and saw the upper half of his brother\nstanding by his bed, looking at him. [The recognition of\nthe figure, and of its sex, and the hat distinguish this from\na Visceral case.] We count both these cases as recurrent, in\nspite of the slight differences between the impressions on the\ndifferent occasions. In most of the recurrent cases, the various\nappearances seem to have resembled one another more closely\nthan in these.\" (103)\n\" Auditory and tactile hallucinations appear to be repeated\nmuch more frequently in proportion than visual hallucina\n\ftl.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 325\nlions . . . but this seems to follow naturally from the smaller\nvariety of form to be found in auditory and tactile cases.\nThe repetition of hallucinations is\u2014as might be expected\n\u2014especially marked in cases occurring during ill-health. If\nthe 106 visual cases reported to us in which the percipient\nwas in ill health, 16, or 15 per cent., were recurrent. It\n-should be said that 7 of these are among the 19 cases which\nneemed so clearly due to ill-health that we have excluded them\njrom, the tables ; but recurrence is also found in over 10\nper cent, of the remainder, whereas, of all the visual cases\nincluded in the Census, only 71, or 5'5 per cent, were recurrent.\nThe connection between recurrence and ill health is less\nmarked in the auditory and tactile cases. Of the 40 auditory\nand tactile cases reported to us as occurring during HI\nhealth, 18, or 45 per cent., were recurrent, while of all the\n\u2022auditory and tactile cases included in the Census, 181, or\n-36 per cent, were recurrent.\" (164)\nRecurrence is no doubt fairly common in \"local appari\ntion \" cases. Fortunately the Society has made it a rule\nto attach no evidential weight to alleged hauntings, unless\nthe phenomena are testified to by more than one percipient.\nOtherwise it is far from improbable that the experiences of\npersons suffering from visceral disease would have been accepted\nas evidence for \" local \" apparitions.\nIt is easy to see how the hallucinations of a person attacked\nby some visceral disease might easily be mistaken for a\n\" local apparition \" case. The hallucinations may begin at\nthe onset of the disease, and therefore before, in the great\nmajority of cases, its presence is recognised : and the patient\naccordingly might quite innocently report himself as being,\n\u2022or even as having been at the time, in ordinary health. Since\nalso the visual hallucinations occur in the dark a patient\nwould experience them in 19 cases out of 20 in his bedroom,\nwhich would thus become the \" Haunted Room,\" and the ghost\nwould be properly \" localised.\" The recurrence of the pheno\nmenon would go to prove that it was not an illusion, and\nmight further be held to support the view that it was not\npurely subjective. With the progress of the disease the form\nof the hallucinations might change, and if they became audi\ntory we should have the phenomenon of non-vocal noises\n\f326 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nso characteristic of cases of \" Haunted Houses.\" Such a\npossibility is not, I think it will be admitted, very remote.\nBut, as I have already said, the danger has been largely\nguarded against by the Society's demand for corroborative\nevidence. Not entirely guarded against, it is true, for it is-\nquite possible that two or more members of the same house\nhold, and especially of the same family, might be suffering\nsimultaneously, or might suffer successively from some form\nof visceral disease : and then there might be not only two-\nor more witnesses to the phenomena, but in view of the\nuniformity of Visceral hallucinations, their description of their\nexperiences might tally to a singular degree. If a second\ninmate of the same house developed a visceral disease accom\npanied by hallucinations a year or two after the first patient,\nwe should hear of a \" recrudescence \" of the phenomena. But\nthe case for \" haunted houses \" does not depend for protection\nagainst such an attack as I have suggested solely on corro\nborative evidence. Let alone the points of differentiation\nfrom Visceral hallucinations drawn from \" Local Apparition \"\ncases contained in the Census Report, to which I have\nalready directed attention in this review, any one can satisfy\nhimself as to the want of any real resemblance between\nthe hallucinations of Visceral patients and those reported by\nresidents in haunted houses, if he will take the trouble to-\nstudy carefully half-a-dozen \" local apparition \" cases picked\nat random from the Proceedings or Journal.\nXVI. ' ' Sex plays a considerable part in the facility with which\n[these mental changes] occur. For three times as many women\nas men had hallucinations during their stay in hospital, although\nthe total number of cases used in this research comprised 102 men\nand 90 women.\"\n\" The number of men who experience sensory hallucinations\nand remember them is to the number of women who do so\nin the ratio of nearly 2 to 3 \" . . .\n\" Men appear to forget their hallucinations more rapidly\nthan women.\" (152-3)\nThe greater liability of women to hallucinations holds good\nof Psychical Percipients : though the disproportion is-\nsmaller.\nI\n\fLi.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 327\nNo addition such as was made by the Census Committee\nneed be made to the number of hallucinations experienced\nby Dr. Head's male patients by way of allowance for forgetful-\nness : for under the particular circumstances forgetfulness cannot\nhave played any appreciable part. On the other hand, Dr.\nHead reduced the number of hallucinations experienced by his\nfemale patients on the ground that certain conditions peculiar\nto their sex favour the appearance of hallucinations. How\nlarge this reduction was is not stated : but I should imagine\nthat it amounted to at least one-sixth of the total number.\nWhether or no the same cause predisposes women in\ngeneral to hallucination, and whether or no a similar reduc\ntion might consequently have been made in the number of\nhallucinations reported to the Census Committee by female\npercipients, it remains true in any case that the excess of\nhallucinations of female over those of male patients suffering\nfrom visceral disease is very much larger than the excess\nof hallucinations of female over those of male Psychical\nPercipients.\nBut this also is clear, that even if very large allowances\nbe made for forgetfulness among men and predisposing causes\namong women, women, whether suffering from a visceral\ndisease or not, are more subject to hallucinations than men.\nXVII. \"It is uncommon to find two hallucinations occurring\ntogether at the same moment. One patient told me she heard\ntapping at an upstairs window, and, looking, saw a white face.\nBut in the great majority of instances, if a patient suffers from\nhallucinations of more than one kind, these hallucinations occur\non entirely separate occasions.\"\nOr, translated into the phraseology of the Census Report, the\nhallucinations of sufferers from visceral disease are only very\nrarely bisensory.\nBut the word bisensory is used to cover two similar but\nnot identical phenomena, between which there seems to me\nto be a not unimportant distinction. Bisensory hallucinations,\nas I have observed above, are of two kinds, those which are\nsimultaneously and those which are successively bisensory.\nIt is, however, more often than not impossible to draw\nthe line in any one given instance ; and the case quoted\n\f328 J. G. Piddington. [PABT\nin the heading of this section is an excellent illustration of\nthis ambiguity. From the fact of Dr. Head preluding his\ncitation of the case by speaking of \" two hallucinations\noccurring together at the same moment\" it might be inferred\nthat the senses of hearing and sight were really affected\n\" together at the same moment,\" but Dr. Head's account of\nthe incident is not sufficiently definite to establish the\nreal simultaneity of the double hallucination ; and we are, I\nthink, justified in asking : Did the auditory really overlap\nthe visual hallucination ? or, in other words, did not the\nwoman cease to hear the tapping when she saw the face ?\nHad the patient been cross-examined even within a few\nminutes of her experience she could not probably have given\na confident answer. This ambiguity attaches, I believe, to\nthe majority of bisensory hallucinations : but there are a few\ncases where the two senses were beyond question affected\nsimultaneously. (For instances see 192; 195-196; 389-390\n385-6; 252; and 295-6.)\nBut to revert to the one bisensory case all too briefly\nmentioned by Dr. Head. Was it really bisensory ? The white\nface seen by the patient was no doubt hallucinatory, but the\ntapping may have been a real sound rightly perceived and\nlocalised, or an illusion, i.e. a real sound, rightly perceived, and\nwrongly localised, or wrongly perceived and rightly localised,\nor both wrongly localised and wrongly perceived. If the\ntapping was an illusion or a real sound, the case would then\nfall into line with those cases in the Census Collection where\na noise (as the Committee was led to believe) induced a\n(subsequent) visual hallucination \" by creating in the hearer\na strong expectation of seeing something corresponding to it\nor that may account for it.\" (178)\nBut, again, was the hearing of the tapping at the window\nand the seeing of the face a hallucination of the Visceral type\nat all? There is no reason why visceral disease should exempt\na patient from all liability to hallucinations except those charac\nteristic of the disease. And it is quite possible that among\nthe 192 patients under Dr. Head's observation some few\nmay have experienced hallucinations for the form of which\ntheir disease was not in any way responsible.\nI regret that Dr. Head did not deal in greater detail with\n\fLI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 329\nthese \" uncommon \" cases of bisensory hallucination among his\npatients ; for had he done so we should have been in a\nbetter position to judge not only whether both affections of\nthe senses were hallucinatory, and how far these bisensory\nhallucinations conformed with typical hallucinations of Visceral\npatients affecting one sense only, but also what proportion\nthey bore to hallucinations involving only one sense.\nContenting ourselves, however, with the statement that\nthey were \" uncommon,\" let us see to what degree bisensory\nhallucinations are common or uncommon among Psychical\nPercipients. If cases where an auditory non-vocal hallucination\nforms one part of the compound hallucination are included\n(and these cases form obviously the best basis for a fair com\nparison with the Visceral type) in 14 per cent, of the Census\ncases more than one sense was affected.\nIf we omit cases where one part of the compound experience\nconsisted of a non-vocal sound, the proportion of bisensory\ncases falls to 9'5 per cent.\nIn coincidental cases (i.e. coincidental for the most part with\ndeath, illness, or crises of some kind) the proportion of bi-\nand tri-sensory cases rises to 14-5 per cent.; and to 17'5\nper cent, if we confine ourselves to visual death coincidences.\nOn the most unfavourable basis, then, Census cases show\nan average of 9-5 per cent, of bisensory hallucinations,\nand we only arrive at this low average by excluding from\nour calculations the very type of bisensory hallucinations which\nalone supplies even a superficial resemblance to the bisensory\nhallucinations of visceral patients. On the most favourable\nbasis the average rises to 17 '5 per cent.\nWhile it would be idle to speculate as to what exact pro\nportion Dr. Head meant to indicate by the term \" uncommon,\"\n1 have practically no doubt that he could not have so\ndescribed the bisensory cases among his patients had they\nrepresented any such proportions as 14'5 or 17'5 per cent.\nI have gone into this question with some care because of\nthe important part which bisensory hallucinations play in\nS.P.R. coincidental or veridical cases. Except for their greater\n\" impressiveness \" (a feature which, I must admit, does not\nappear very impressive to me), the only characteristic that\ndistinguishes veridical from purely subjective cases lies in the\n\f330 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nmarked preponderance of bi- and tri-sensory hallucinations\nwhich figure among the veridical cases. It is particularly\nsatisfactory, therefore, to find that between the class of hallu\ncinations which from our point of view are of the greatest\nimportance and the hallucinations of visceral disease lies this-\nbroad line of cleavage.\nXVIII. CHARACTERISTICS OF S.P.R. HALLUCINATIONS\nWHICH ARE NOT REPORTED AS OCCURRING IN\nVISCERAL HALLUCINATIONS.\nIn the preceding section I have drawn attention to the\nrarity of bisensory hallucinations among patients suffering from\nvisceral disease, and have, moreover, explained my reasons\nfor doubting whether in these rare cases the two elements of\nthe experience are simultaneous, as they unquestionably are\nin some S.P.R. cases ; and I have even gone so far as to-\nquestion whether the two elements are both hallucinatory ; in\nother words, whether Visceral hallucinations are ever really\nbisensory. I now proceed to point out how of certain\nextremely characteristic features of S.P.R. hallucinations\u2014\nincluding some of those very features which have led us to\nregard the phenomena as \" metapsychical \"\u2014no trace is to be\nfound in Dr. Head's account of the hallucinations that\naccompany visceral disease. And here we shall be treading on\nground firmer than in the last section, though not quite so\nfirm as I could wish. For the argument from silence is a\ndangerous one ; and I would not draw from Dr. Head's silence\nthe positive conclusion that none of these features ever presents\nitself in the hallucinatory experiences of Visceral Patients.\nLet us take first Veridicality, i.e., coincidence between a\nhallucination and an event unknown to the hcdlucint. Dr.\nHead, who was treating his subject from a medical and not\nfrom a Psychical Research point of view, does not report in\nhis lectures any case of real or supposed coincidence. He tells\nme, however, that, as a matter of fact, some of his patients\ndid claim that their hallucinations were veridical ; but he did\nnot examine into these alleged coincidences, as this aspect of\nthe matter did not lie within his province.\nIf telepathy is, as we suppose, a vera causa, there is indeed\non the face of it no reason why a person in a morbid physical\n\fLI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 331\n\u2022condition should not experience a genuinely telepathic hallu\ncination as much as a person in a healthy condition. The\nreason why a coincidental hallucination occurring to a sick person\nis less strong as evidence for telepathy than one occurring to\na healthy person is to a great extent because hallucinations\nare known to be more frequent in the former case and\ntherefore afford more scope for chance coincidences with the\ndeath of a friend, or some such event.\nDr. Head has, as will be seen on reference to the quotation\n\u2022which heads section VIII., noted that when visual hallucinations\nwere accompanied by the depressed mood his patients were\ngiven to regard the apparition as a sign of some coming\nmisfortune, such, e.y., as the death of some member of their\nfamily. In his lectures he does not say if the patients ever\n\u2022enquired whether their fears were realised. He has told me,\nhowever, that, at least in some cases, such enquiries were\nmade, and resulted occasionally in a coincidence of some sort\nbeing claimed.\nNow we have seen (see footnote to XV.) that hallucinations\nare extraordinarily frequent among Visceral Patients; and\naccordingly some real or fancied coincidences were almost\nbound to occur.\nOne of the strangest points about Psychical coincidental cases\nis that the hallucinations of the percipients which furnish ex\namples of coincidence are, in the great majority of instances,\nunique or almost unique experiences in their lives. But, it may\nbe objected, the hallucinations were not really unique; it was only\nthe coincidences which were unique, and which thus have been\nremembered, while the frequent non-coincidental hallucinations\nhave been forgotten. Well, even if large allowance be made\nfor this source of error, there still remains another feature of\nPsychical veridical cases to explain away, namely, their vivid\nness. A Visceral visual hallucination, consisting as it does of a\nveiled figure of uncertain sex, speechless, gestureless, wearing no\ndistinctive clothing, armless and legless, beardless, the face misty\n\u2022or even invisible, could not furnish instances of coincidence\nanything like so circumstantial as do the more vividly exter\nnalised figures seen by Psychical Percipients. Coincidence, then\nof a kind does, no doubt, exist between the hallucinations of\nVisceral Patients and external events, but not coincidence of\n\f332 \/. G. Piddington. [PART\nthe definite and vivid description which characterises a large\nnumber of the veridical cusos collected by the S.P.R.\nI have spoken of coincidence or veridicality as a character\nistic of Psychical hallucinations for the sake of convenience ;\nfor, of course, coincidence is a matter of subsequent inference,\nand does not \u2022 form a part of the actual experience of the\npercipients, as do other features of which I am now going to\nspeak.\nOf these the most conspicuous by its absence from the\nreported experiences of Visceral Patients is Collectivity. Here\nagain (and the same observation applies to \" local \" cases),\nthere is no reason why this phenomenon\u2014or a mimicry of it\n\u2014should not present itself in Visceral cases.\nThis might happen in one of two ways :\nThe hallucinations of Visceral Patients resemble one\nanother very closely and show little variety, and occur under\ncertain well-defined conditions : auditory when the surroundings\nof the patient are quiet, visual in the dark. This being so, is it\nunlikely that several patients suffering from one of the forms\nof visceral disease specially favourable to the appearance of\nhallucinations should occupy the same ward of a hospital ;\nand that two of them should have at or about the same time\n(it must be remembered that many of these hallucinations are\nby no means momentary) a similar visual or auditory hallucina\ntion ? They might not speak of it to each other, but they\nmight each independently mention it to the doctor in charge\nof their case.\nOr, as we have no grounds for assuming that liability to\nhallucinations of visceral origin renders a patient immune\nfrom other forms of hallucination, a possible variation of the\nmanner suggested above in which a parody of true collectivity\nmight be produced suggests itself. One patient might have\na typical hallucination arising purely from his morbid physical\ncondition, while a second patient in the same or an adjoining\nward might at or about the same time receive a corresponding\nimpression telepathically.\nThe first supposition has, I should say, a much better\nchance of being realised than the second. But anyhow it is\nsatisfactory that no trace of either having been realised is to\nbe found in Dr. Head's lectures.\n\fIJ.] Review of Dr. HeacPa Oouhtonian Lectures. 333\nDr. Head mentions no tendency on the part of his patients\nto localise their hallucinations. Clearly a patient who had\nseen apparitions in his own house and then soon after entering\nthe hospital saw the same apparition again in a ward would,\nhowever much inclined before to regard his apparition as a\nlocal haunt, abandon that interpretation of the phenomenon.\nBut the hallucinations experienced by patients before admis\nsion were not by any means always repeated after admission.\nThey might have visual and auditory hallucinations at home,\nand only moods of depression when in hospital ; or visual\nand auditory hallucinations when in hospital and not at home,\nand so on. And even if hallucinations were experienced both\nbefore and after admission, the recurrence of the hallucination in\nthe hospital would not necessarily immediately follow admis\nsion : and during the interval one can easily understand how\na patient might be led to imagine that his change of habita\ntion had rid him of his ghost. That no such tendency to\nlocalise their hallucinations is reported of Visceral Patients is\nall the more noteworthy inasmuch as the great majority\nof visual hallucinations must havo appeared to a patient in the\nroom in which he slept.\nIf these patients who had visual hallucinations at home\ndid not really regard their bedrooms as the scene of a local\nhaunt, it may have been because they connected the apparition\nrather with the dark than with the room ; or, to put it in\nanother way, they were more familiar with the popular theory\nthat darkness is a necessary condition for seeing a ghost than\nwith the theory that ghosts attach themselves to certain\nlocalities.\nOne would have imagined, too, that the non-recognition of\nthe figures would have helped to lead them to regard their\nhallucinations as local ghosts. By which I do not, of course,\nmean that because a ghost is recognised he therefore loses\nipso facto all claim to be considered as \" local,\" but a recognised\nghost could hardly be treated as \" local \" unless he appeared\nin an appropriate locality, e.g. in a locality connected with\nhis earth-career.\nOr, again, there may be some intimate, indefinable and\nuncommunicable instinct which makes the patient recognise\nthat the causes of the phenomenon lie somehow in himseF\n\f334 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nand thus prevents him from sharing the conviction of most\nghost-seers of witnessing a phenomenon external to, and in no\nway dependent on, themselves.\nWe meet with no instances of the Development of Hallu\ncinations, and while it is not surprising to find no parallel to\nthose rare and doubtful cases that the Census Committee entitled\n\" Reciprocal,\" it is somewhat strange that Visceral Patients\nare apparently free from Tactile hallucinations: for three other\nof the senses\u2014sight, smell, and hearing \u2014 were affected.\nOut of 16 84 hallucinations of various kinds collected in\nthe Census there were 127 purely tactile, and 56 cases where\nthe sense of touch was affected concomitantly with another\nsense.\nThe Census Committee expressed the opinion that to Ex\npectancy and Suggestion were due a variety of cases of halluci\nnation, and especially of the development and elaboration of\nhallucinations : thus, for example, a real sound might start a\nvisual hallucination, a hallucinatory sound might lead up to a\nvisual hallucination, or, the appearance of a phantasmal figure\nmight excite the natural expectation that the apparition had\nsomething to say and would accordingly induce an auditory\nhallucination, and so on.\nAny such effects of expectancy or suggestion are markedly\nabsent in Visceral hallucinations. In only one case, already\nmentioned (v. XVII.), do we read of a patient hearing a sound\nand seeing an apparition ; and we have besides Dr. Head's\ndefinite statement to the effect that \" in the great majority of\ninstances, if a patient suffers from hallucinations of more\nthan one kind, these hallucinations occur on entirely separate\noccasions.\"\nThe same absence of any elaboration or development in the\nhallucinations of Visceral Patients can be inferred from the\nuniformity or at least great similarity of the visual apparitions,\nand particularly from the invariable silence of the hallucina\ntory figures. In fact a person suffering from visceral disease\nseems an extraordinarily unsuggestible person. He can\nrepeatedly see a ghostly figure standing by his bedside, and\nyet have not enough imagination to make the figure speak :\nand cannot even make it move, except, at most, within a\nlimited area, which is the more remarkable inasmuch as\n\f1J.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 335\nmovement would not involve the bringing of another sense\nunder the spell of the hallucination, but only an extension\nof the hallucination of the sense already affected. He can\nhear weird sounds, which others present with him cannot\nhear, and hear them sometimes night after night, and yet\nthese strange sounds do not provoke a visual hallucination.1\nEven when a woman patient forms so definite an expectation\nthat she remembers to report it to Dr. Head in describing\nher experience, it produces no effect whatever :\n\" In one case . . . the patient saw a hand and arm come\nround the door of the ward that stood open flush with her\nbed. This arm was extended on to the white counterpane,\nand she sat up in bed expecting the body to appear round the\nedge of the wide-opened door.\" [The italics are mine.]\nI take it for granted that the body did not appear, though\nthis is not definitely stated, but is, I think, to be inferred with\ncertainty from Dr. Head's silence.\nXIX. 'NEURALGIA' IN CENSUS CASES.\nIt will be remembered that \" reflected visceral pain seems to\nbe the one universal concomitant of \" hallucinations \" in\ncases of visceral disease amongst sane persons \" ; and that\n\" the main factor \" in their production \" is the presence of\nreflected visceral pain accompanied by superficial tenderness.\"\nThe reflected visceral pain usually took the form of \" head\nache,\" the superficial tenderness affecting various regions of\nthe scalp.\nNow in the Census Collection I have noted one instance\nwhere a percipient definitely describes herself as experiencing\na hallucination during a bad attack of headache.\n\" One Sunday I was suffering greatly from headache, to\nwhich I was then very subject. Mrs. M placed me on the\nsofa, and said she would take charge of the children, in\nthe hope that perfect quiet would do me good. Shortly after,\nshe came to me and touched me on the shoulder, saying, as\n1 A Visceral Patient may, of course, experience a visual hallucination subse\nquently to his having heard hallucinatory sounds, but with the one exception\nnoted above there seems to be no evidence to suggest that sounds lead up\nto the appearance of figures.\nY\n\f336 J.

Knowing she wag\nin delicate health, I immediately followed her out of the room,\nseeing her until I reached the hatt, when I su}1posed she\npassed through one of the doors leading out of the hall.\nI then went to look for the children, and to my surprise\nfound the mother reading to them ; she asked why 1 had\ndisturbed myself ; my reply was, ' You called me.'

Mrs. M died in less than a fortnight from that\ntime.\" (193)\nExcept that the auditory part of the (tri-sensory) halluci\nnation took place in the absence of disturbing noise, it would\nbe hard even to invent a case displaying wider divergences\nfrom the Visceral type.\nWe may suppose that the percipient was likewise suffering\nfrom \" headache \" during the following experience :\n\" [I saw] afigure of a man which was perfectly transparent,\nand vhich came into the room and sat down on a chair\nby my side. I was in bed and had been suffering from\nsevere illness, which had affected my head.\" (119)\nDetails are lacking, but the transparency of the figure, its\nmovement across the room, and its sitting down do not seem\nto accord with the appearance or behaviour of a Visceral\napparition.\nWe have already referred (v. I. \/) to the (coincidental) halluci\nnation of a percipient who was \" in very weak health\u2014suffering\nintensely with neuralgia\u2014having come through a bad confine\nment,\" and who describes herself as engrossed with grief for\nthe loss of her baby and with the pain of her neuralgia,\nand have already seen how her experience differed from the\nVisceral type.\nTwo accounts are printed in appendices (407-13) to\nthe Census Report of the hallucinatory experiences, extending\nover several years, of two ladies, who both connect many,\nthough not all, of their hallucinations with \" neuralgia in\nthe head,\" or \" neuralgic headaches \" of a severe kind.\nOne of them in addition to \" intense neuralgic headaches \"\nhad \" an attack of bronchitis,\" during which \" she had fre\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lecture*. 337\nquent and varied optical hallucinations.\" But though we\nmight have expected in both these cases, and especially in\nthe latter one, to find a resemblance to the Visceral type of\nhallucination, as a matter of fact we find the precise contrary.\nIt may be that \" headache \" generally,\u2014i.e. headache of no\nmatter what origin\u2014if severe enough, is conducive to halluci\nnations, while headache of visceral origin determines the\nparticular form which the hallucinations of the patients\nassume.\nOf all the cases printed in the Census Report the hallu\ncination which in my opinion shows the closest resemblance,\nperhaps the only one which shows a really close resemblance at\nall to a visual hallucination of visceral origin, was experienced\nby a percipient who at the moment of seeing the apparition\nwas suffering from a \" very acute pain in the middle of \" her\n\" back.\" The percipient, it is true, reports herself as in good\nhealth at the time, and her experience was unique, and she\nmakes no mention of \" headache.\" But she does speak of\n\" very acute pain in the back,\" and this expression, vague\nand unsatisfactory though it be from a medical point of view,\nputs me in mind of the following sentence in Dr. Head's\ntreatise :\n\" Headache of the reflected visceral type, particularly when\naccompanied by similar pain and tenderness on the trunk, is\nliable to be associated with hallucinations.\"\nIt is at least curious that this mention of very acute\npain in the middle of the back should crop up in the case\nwhich seems to me to come nearest to the Visceral type of\nhallucination.\n\" [About 14 years ago] I was awakened in the middle of\nthe night [v.

Some, no doubt, approach\nit more or less closely, but none absolutely corresponds. And\nif this be true of the Census cases, it must, broadly speaking,\nbe true of the mass of cases published by the Society. I\ndo not, of course, go so far as to say that the thirty odd\nvolumes of our Proceedings and Journal do not contain a\nsingle example of a Visceral hallucination : but, inasmuch as\nthere exists no difference in character between the hallucinations\nof the Census Report and those reported in our other volumes,\nI do maintain that, if cases of the Visceral type have crept\nin, they are too few and far between to throw any appreciable\ndiscredit on the bulk.\nThis conclusion, if well founded, as I firmly believe it to\nbe, carries with it a splendid tribute to the labours of the\nCensus Committee. They had to do their work in ignorance\nof the facts which Dr. Head has only recently brought to\nlight ; and it was only their vigilant circumspection and their\nwise mistrust of all mental phenomena occurring, or suspected\nof occurring, under any morbid conditions that preserved them\nfrom a trap into which less critical investigators might easily\n\fLI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonwn Lectures. 339\nhave fallen. And if their caution thus saved them from\nadmitting hallucinations due to a morbid condition of the\nviscera, a strong presumption is created that it equally prevented\nthem from mistaking for hallucinations of the sane and healthy\nhallucinations due to forms of disease other than visceral.\nThese considerations cannot but increase our confidence in\nthe conclusions which the Committee drew from their material.\nHow important these conclusions were is, I fear, not known\nto the great majority of such of our members as have joined\nthe Society since the issue of the Census Report : and if this\nreview serve no other good purpose, this purpose, at least, I\nhope it will serve\u2014namely, to draw attention to that fine\npiece of work, the Report on tlie Census of Hallucinations, and\nto the deductions drawn by the Committee from it\u2014deductions\nforming, I may add, the only scientific generalisation which\nso far can be said to have received the official sanction of the\nCouncil of the Society.\nWhile, then, we have no cause to fear a comparison between\nhallucinations of visceral origin and those collected by our\nSociety, there is no reason why we should not take a leaf out\nof Dr. Head's book and in future direct special attention to\nsuch points, among others, as the colour and movement of\napparitions; and we should also do well to interrogate percipients\nclosely as to the state of their health for some months before\nand after their hallucinatory experiences.\nJ. G. PlDDINGTON.\nPOSTCRIPT.\nSince the above was written, Mr. Podmore has been kind\nenough to indicate one possible line of attack which I have\nnot met. This attack, which Mr. Podmore must not be under\nstood to endorse himself, may be stated as follows :\nThe chief differentiae between Psychical and Visceral hallucina\ntions are just the very features which a memory allowed free\nplay for its inventiveness during a long interval of time between\nthe date of an experience and the date of record, and influenced\nby a dominant idea, would produce, e.g., the completeness, the\ndress, the colour, the free and natural movement, the speech\nand the clear recognition of the figures.\n\f340 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nIn other words, the chief differentiae are precisely those sen\nsational details which lapse of time would introduce into the\nnarratives.\nYou have quoted, my critic might say, the Psychical cases\non which you have drawn to illustrate the divergences from the\nVisceral type of hallucinations, without discriminating between\nthose of recent and those of remote date.\nI would meet this criticism first on general and then on\nparticular grounds :\nFirst, I would remark that most of the \" sensational \" features\ncan be paralleled from other sources. Thus colour is a typical\nfeature of the hallucinations of the insane ; movement of the\nhallucinations of inebriates and dipsomaniacs ; articulate speech\nof the hallucinations of insanity and of religious ecstasy. I see\nno more reason to question the existence of these characteristics\nin the one case than in the others.\nAgain, in three points at least, the characteristics of Visceral\nhallucinations are more \" sensational \" than those reported by\nthe majority of Psychical Percipients. Thus, Visceral Patients\ndescribe the figure as \" draped \" or \" wrapped \" in a sheet,\nquite after the manner of the story-book ghost ; whereas most\nPsychical ghosts are dressed, as was King Arthur in the poet's\ndream, \"like a modern gentleman.\" The histrionic tendency\nwould rather have represented the phantom, not in common\nplace modern dress, but \" like a country Ghoste in his white\npeackled sheete.\"\nVisceral phantoms are nearly always seen in the dark ; Psy\nchical phantoms both in daylight and in the dark. Here again\na romantic-minded percipient would have inclined to make the\nghost appear in the dead of night, or in the gloaming. Besides\nthis, the evidence of Psychical Percipients to the appearance\nof apparitions in broad daylight seems to be much too strong\nto be got over by any manner of means.\nThe white figures seen by Visceral Patients are described as\n\" corpses \" : a designation used very rarely indeed by Psychical\nPercipients.\nSecondly, I may say that I have now gone through all the\ncases used in this review, through many cases printed in the\nCensus Report, and also through other cases recorded elsewhere\nin the Proceedings, in the Journal, and in Phantasms of the\n\fLL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 341\nlaving, and I can find no warrant for the suggestion that\nvivid sensational details increase in proportion as the interval\nbetween occurrence and record increases. I believe vivid details\nto be present just as much in cases recorded within a few days,\nweeks or months of their occurrence, as in cases which have\nnot been recorded until after a lapse of 10, 20, and 30 years\nor more.\n\f342 Dr. Walter Leaf.

(Longmans, Green & Co.,\nLondon, New York and Bombay, 1904.)\n\"This volume contains some fragments of prose aud poetry\nwritten by my husband during a period of many years, and on\ndivers subjects ; as such it cannot but appear to a certain degree\nheterogeneous and disconnected. And yet the singleness of purpose\nand steadfastness of endeavour which are shown throughout will, I\nthink, give it a sufficient unity in the eyes of those who have\nsympathised with the author's aspirations or shared his hopes.\"\nThese words, the opening of Mrs. Myers's short preface, sufficiently\nsum up what a reviewer has to say. The disconnectedness of the\nbook is patent ; yet the parts all contribute to the whole picture\nof a life of such well-knit purpose and definite aim as few men can\nlook back upon when their time comes to review their past as\nMyers has reviewed his.\nThe brief and confessedly somewhat incomplete \" Fragments of\nInner Life \"\u2014they can hardly be called an autobiography\u2014with\nwhich the volume opens form unquestionably the most interesting\naud important part of it.

The whole form a series.\nMyers may almost be said to have written his own obituary notice\nin the same spirit in which he wrote those of his closest friends \u2014\na spirit of conviction not merely that the barrier between the two\nworlds is permeable and only half real, but also that in some\n\" world-memory \" all the inner life of every soul is irrevocably\nrecorded, and is legible to every other individual spirit, at least\nwhen free from the trammels of the conscious self.

Other pathways have now led me to\nsomething like the creed which they foresaw ; but it is still, and\nmore than ever, the support of my life.\" These sentences give us\nthe clue to the intimate relation of the artistic and ethical sides of\nMyers's mind of which I have elsewhere spoken.\nFor a time indeed the purely artistic sense gained, under the\nstimulus of Pindar and Sappho, the upper hand\u2014\"from the age of\nsixteen to twenty-three there was no influence in my life com\nparable to Hellenism in the fullest sense of the word.\" He drank\nin the air of Hellas in full draughts during a journey in 1864, only\nto find that the passion of past beauty could not satisfy his aspira\ntions. \" The classics . . . might aid imaginative impulse and de\ntachment from sordid interests, but they had no check for pride.\"\nThe Hellenic ideal vanished with \" a bitter-sweet passion of regret,\"\nand left him cold and lonely. From this passing stage of numb\nindifference he was recalled to the Christianity of his early years\nby Mrs. George Butler\u2014that remarkable woman whose influence\nwas strikingly felt by many of the younger intellects of that gene\nration. It was this period which gave the world \"St. Paul.\" The\nphase is a striking and interesting one\u2014more surprising perhaps\nin the sixties than it appears to-day. It gave Myers complete\nsatisfaction for a time, so far as his emotional and moral needs\nwere concerned ; but from the intellect came a gradual and painful\ndisillusionment, leading to a distressing phase of agnosticism, satis\nfying nothing, and unmanning even the desire to help his fellow-\nmen. At this time the guiding influences were first those of\n\f344 Dr. Walter Leaf. [PART\nGeorge Eliot and later of Henry Sidgwick ; in company with\nSidgwick he began about 1871 to turn his attention towards \"spiri\ntualism\" as a possible key to the eternal problem. It was in 1873\nthat, in the stances, I believe, of a professional medium, he first\nmet phenomena which profoundly impressed him. He barely men\ntions them here, and, indeed, was always very reticent about those\nthat most struck him, feeling strongly the gap between personal\nbelief and scientific evidence. But it was this period which set\nhim definitely on the quest\u2014first pursued through wearisome pro\nfessional stances, leading almost always to disappointment and\ndetection ; afterwards in the clearer air of the experiments of\nthe newly formed S. P. R. ; but invariably carried on with in\ndomitable perseverance and dauntless hope. From this point the\ndevelopment of Myers's thought is open to all men to read\u2014it is\nall there in his papers in our publications and in Human Personality.\nHe sums up his final creed in three statements ; firstly, the fact of\nman's survival of death ; secondly, the registration in the universe\nof every past scene and thought; thirdly, a progressive moral\nevolution, no longer truncated by physical catastrophes, but moving\ncontinuously towards an infinitely distant goal. In this creed he\nfound at last complete satisfaction, though no relaxation of en\ndeavour.\nThe story is profoundly interesting, as must be the story of a\nsensitive and vigorous intellect which has thus proved and rejected\nin turn the chief faiths of his time, to find refuge in a new belief\nof which he was largely the creator. The record is not of course\nin any sense complete. In the first place it is not a contempo\nraneous record\u2014the earlier stages are described as they appeared\nto a mind largely developed and changed. The few letters which\nare inserted in the narrative serve only in a very slight measure\nto fill the gap; and no man was more conscious than Myers of the\nimmense importance of the contemporaneous record. And of course\nthey cover only a portion of the inner life. Not even a Rousseau\n\u2014much less so impressionable a man as Myers\u2014could publish the\nwhole of the circumstances which moulded his life ; and even the\npoems, which form a large part of the volume, hint at emotions and\nexperiences that find no place in the autobiography. The fine\nsonnet on p. 13fi, for instance, is an expression of what was one of\nthe keen disappointments of his later life, that he received no\nOjpernormal message from dying friends, however closely bound to\nBut one cannot entirely suppress a suspicion that Myers\n\fLI.] Reviews. 345\nhimself, had he published anything, would have published more\u2014\nthat the book is not so complete and outspoken a revelation as\nbe wished it to be.

These will doubtless give a fuller picture of him\nthan any but his closest friends can now possess ; in the meantime\nwe must be grateful for what we are allowed to know. The\nlesson of the life should be inspiring even to those who must disagree\nwith Myers's final creed ; it is a story of fmal success after many\nfailures, of peace not bought, as too often, by self-surrender in\nexchange for the comfort of spiritual guidance and parental dogma,\nChristian or Buddhist, but wrested by strenuous struggles of will\nand thought from the riddle of life. Emotion and intellect worked\nin alliance instead of civil war. To many men the final victory\nmeans the death of one or other; with Myers they both had con\nquered when peace was proclaimed.\nWALTER LEAF.\nMultiple Perfonality; An experimental investigation into the Nature\n\u00ab\/ Human Individuality. By BORIS SIDIS, M.A., Ph.D. and SIMON\nP. GOODHART, Ph.B., M.D. (London: Sidney Appleton, 1905).\nAbout one third of this book is occupied with the description\nof the remarkable case of Mr. Hanna, a case of loss of memory\nmore complete than has ever before been recorded. The case is\nof the greatest possible interest to the psychologist and is important\nalso from the point of view of the \" psychical researcher.\" Mr.\nHanna, a well-educated, intelligent, and healthy young clergyman fell\nhead foremost to the ground from his carriage and was carried\nby his brother in an almost lifeless condition to a neighbouring\nhouse. He lay some two hours showing no sign of life other than\nfeeble movements of respiration, and then \" began to move, opened\nhis eyes, looked around, moved his arm, then sat upright in bed,\narose, reached toward one of the physicians and attempted to\npush him. Thinking the patient iu a state of delirium, and fearing\nan attack, they seized him and attempted to push him back upon\nthe bed. Mr. Hanna resisted vigorously and a struggle ensued.\"\nThe efforts of four men were needed to overcome the struggles of\nthe patient, who then lay still and looked curiously about him.\nIt then appeared not only that \" he had lost the faculty of speech,\n. . . but he had also lost all power of recognition of objects, words\n\f346 W. McDougall. [PART\nand persons. He was in a state of complete mental blindness.\nHe was as a newly born infant opening his eyes for the first time\nupon the world. . . . The world was to Mr. Hanna but a chaos\nof sensations, not as yet elaborated and differentiated into a system\nof distinct percepts and concepts ; neither objects, nor space, nor\ntime, in the form as they are presented to the developed adult\nmind, existed for him. So totally obliterated from memory were\nthe experiences of his past life that even the requirements of the\nsimplest mental processes by which the appreciation of distance,\nform, size, magnitude is acquired, were effaced from his mind.\nMovement alone attracted his attention. He did not know the\ncause and meaning of movement, but a moving object fastened his\ninvoluntary attention and seemed to fascinate his gaze. He made\nas yet no discrimination between his own movements and those of\nother objects, and was as much interested in the movement of his\nown limbs as in that of external things. He did not know how\nto control his voluntary muscles, nor had he any idea of the possi\nbility of such a control. From the more or less involuntary chance\nmovements made by his arms and legs, he learned the possibility\nof controlling his limbs. . . . He could not co-ordinate the move\nments of his legs, hence he could not walk. Unable to discriminate\nbetween his own activity and that of others, the world was not\nyet differentiated into the objective and subjective, and he had no\nidea of ego activity. . . . He did not have the least conception\nof the flow of time,\u2014seconds, minutes, hours were alike to him. . . .\nThe sensation of hunger, though present in all its intensity, as we\nafterwards learned, could not be interpreted by him, and he certainly\ndid not know how to appease it. When food was offered him, he\ndid not understand the purpose of it ; nor when it was placed within\nhis mouth did he know how to masticate and swallow it. In order\nto feed him, fluid nourishment had to be placed far back into the\npharynx, thus provoking reflex swallowing movements.\"\nThese passages contain the more important statements as .to the\ncondition of the patient on recovering consciousness. They illus\ntrate the chief defect of the report of this most interesting\ncase, namely, the confounding of the facts observed at the time\nby those surrounding the patient with the statements of the\npatient at a later time and with the inferences and theoretical\nviews of the writers of the account, who, unfortunately, did not see\nthe patient until some weeks after the accident. It is much to be\nregretted that in a case of so much importance to psychology, the state\n\fLL] Reviews. 347\nmenu based upon these three sources were not rigidly separated in\nthe report. Nevertheless it seems probable that they give a fair\npicture of the mental state of Mr. Hanna when he first regained\nconsciousness after the accident.\nThe further course of the case is no less interesting. Mr. Hanna\nbegan rapidly to learn all that a child learns and to learn it in much\nthe same way that a child learns, the great difference being that\nhe learned with extreme rapidity. He rapidly acquired control of\nmovements and learnt to walk, to grasp objects and to distinguish\nbetween those near at hand and those at a distance, Although\nat first he had no visual perception of distance, all seen objects\nappearing close to his eyes. He displayed a great interest in the\nspeech of others and acquired the use of language rapidly, learning\nfirst the names of common objects, later the use of adjectives and still\nlater the use of pronouns and of relational and abstract terms. The\nmost remarkable facts in his relearning of speech were that he could\nat once repeat a word or sentence heard though without understanding\nthe meaning, and that a word \" once heard seemed indelibly impressed\nupon his mind, and he never again forgot it.\" This rapidity of\nlearning was displayed not only in regard to capacities previously\nacquired and lost at the time of the accident, but also in acquiring\nnew capacities : e.g. \" Having had no familiarity with the banjo\nbefore the accident, he acquired the skill of playing it in but a few\nhours . . . with the facility of an experienced player.\" No indi\ncation of any memory of his former experiences could be discovered\nuntil the fifth week after the accident, when Mr. Hanna in response\nto questions, described dreams of two kinds, some vague, others\nvivid and clear. These vivid dream images had little meaning\nfor him, yet his description of them enabled his friends to conclude\nthat they were reproductions of sense-impressions of his former\nlife : e.g. he described a railroad and beside it a square house upon\nwhich were the letters N-E-W-B-O-S-T-O-N-J-U-N-C, which\nhe spelled out without understanding their meaning. The next\nevidence of returning memory was obtained by reading to the\npatient a part of a Hebrew passage previously familiar to him.\nHe then repeated the whole passage, without, however, any sense\nof familiarity with it and without understanding it. Attempts to\nhypnotise Mr. Hanna were unsuccessful, and after six weeks spent\nin rapid learning he was removed from his quiet home to New\nYork in order that varied and vivid impressions might stimulate\nhis mind.\n\f348 W. McDougall. [PART\nThe first evening was spent in lively company in a large restaurant.\nEarly the following morning he awoke and to the joy of his brother,\nwho shared his room, he displayed a normal capacity of recalling\nthe events of his former life up to the moment of the accident,\nwhile all his experiences since that moment seemed to be wiped\nout from his mind. He did not recognise his physician, his room\nwas completely strange to him, and he was with difficulty brought\nto admit the lapse of six weeks since the accident, six weeks which\nfor his memory were lacking. He remained awake in this state\nsome three quarters of an hour, then became sleepy, slept for some\nhours and wakened again as he was on the previous evening, i.e.\nwith the command of that knowledge only which he had acquired\nsince the accident. For several days he persisted in this state in\nspite of efforts to stimulate him to recognise scenes and objects\nformerly familiar to him. On the fourth evening he was given a\ndose of cannabis itidica which produced some exaltation, followed by\nsleep. In the morning he awoke in his \" primary \" state again,\nremembering only his life before the accident and the events of the\npreceding short period of recovery. He felt weak and sluggish,\nnevertheless he showed himself in conversation to have full control\nof his stores of learning acquired at school and university. After\na short time he became drowsy, and in spite of all efforts his eyes\nclosed and he fell into a state of profound lethargy and physical\nprostration from which he could not be roused. This state (named\nby the authors the hypnoleptic state) continued for about one\nminute, when the patient suddenly opened his eyes and was found\nto be in his \" secondary \" state. In this state he remained until\nawaking on the following morning, when he was again in the\nprimary state. And these two states then alternated several times,\nthe primary always passing into the secondary through a brief\n\" hypnoleptic \" period, the secondary into the primary through natural\nsleep. Mr. Hanna was urged in every way to resist the oncoming of\nthe drowsiness that heralded the passage into the secondary state,\nuntil one day he, while in his primary state, \"fell into a condition\nof what appeared to be deep abstraction.\" He complained of a\nsevere headache and refused to speak or allow himself to be moved;\nafter about half-an-hour questions elicited responses of \" Yes \" and\n\"No,\" which showed that he knew directly of both primary and\nsecondary states. He remained in this dazed state about two\nhours and then gradually recovered. He stated that while lying\non the couch he was conscious of all that had been said and done\n\fLL] Reviews. 349\nin the room, but that he was \"engaged in one of the most intense\nstruggles he had ever experienced.\" The two personalities, that of\nthe primary and that of the secondary state, \" arose simultaneously\nand confronted each other.\" ... \"It was a struggle for life between\ntwo individualities formed in a single mind, each one endeavour\ning to gain ascendancy and to suppress, to crush the other ; and\nstill neither could be suppressed, because each was part ami parcel\nof the other.\" \" I was willing to take either. The struggle was\nnot so much to choose one as to forget the other. I was trying\nto find which I might most easily forget. It seemed impossible to\nforget one ; both tried to persist in consciousness. It seemed as\nif each memory was stronger than my will, and still I had to\ndetermine which to drive away.\" \"Finally,\" he says, \"I decided\nto take both lives as mine, because of the fear and anxiety that\nthe struggle would be repeated again and again. ... I have now\nretained both memories ; I am sure both are mine. They are\nseparate, and I cannot yet fit the two well together. . . . The\nsecondary state is stronger and brighter, but not more stable.\"\nFrom this time onwards Mr. Hanna retained the power of recall\ning the experiences of both states and may be said to have recovered\ncompletely from the effects of his accident.\nThis remarkable case differs from all others of similar character\nhitherto reported in several respects, notably in the completeness\nof the loss of all acquired facilities and knowledge, and in the\neventual recovery by the fusion of the two personalities or memory-\ncontinua.\nThe authors interpret the case as one of complete \"psycho-\nphysiological dissociation, the dissociation and disaggregations of\nsystems of central neural elements with their concomitant psychic\nsystems or moments consciousness \" The authors claim that this\nprinciple fully accounts for the facts, but to me, at least, much\nremains obscure and hard to explain, perhaps because I fail to seize\nthe leading ideas of the authors and cannot understand what is\nmeant by \" moments consciousness,\" a phrase which plays a great\npart in all the speculative and explanatory discussions of this book.\nThe reported facts of observation (if we accept them without\nicserve) seem to' justify the authors' statement that although he\n(Mr. Hanna) was mentally reduced to a state of infancy, his\nintelligence remained intact. In attempting to understand the con\ndition the most important statements to bear in mind are that\n\"although Mr. Hanna was mentally blind and had lost all know\n\f350 W. McDougall. [PART\nledge formerly possessed, both in relation to the external and\ninternal world ; although he was mentally reduced to a state of\ninfancy, strange to say, his intelligence remained intact. His\ncuriosity for acquiring knowledge was keener than ever, and the\nuse made of his acquisitions was truly astonishing. His faculty\nof judgment, his power of reasoning were as sound and vigorous\nas ever. The content of knowledge seemed to have been lost, but\nthe form of knowledge remained as active as before the accident\nand was perhaps even more precise and definite.\"\nWe may try to account for this condition in terms of changes in\nthe nervous system, accepting some such view of the nature and\nevolution of mind as is given by Herbert Spencer, and remembering\nthat the growth of the individual mind is, according to this view,\ndue to two factors,\u2014(1) the spontaneous development of nervous\nstructure representing the accumulated experience of countless\nancestors, a development that continues throughout the period of\ngrowth ; (2) the retention of the effects of individual experience\nin the form of associations between brain-elements and systems of\nsuch elements brought about in the course of conscious reactions\nto the impressions received from the external world. If with Spencer\nwe assume that in the adult the nervous structures of the former\nkind determine the forms of perception and inference, of mental\nactivity in general, while the latter determine the content of our\nideas and in part of our perceptions, and if we assume, as we may\ndo without improbability, that the latter kind of structure is less\nstably organised than the former, then we may suppose that the\nconcussion of Mr. Hanna's brain brought about some degree of\ndissolution of all associations between brain-elements acquired during\nthe course of his individual experience, leaving intact all those\ninherited by him and representing ancestral experience. In this\nway we may seek to understand the fact that Mr. Hanna's mind\nseemed emptied of content while retaining its faculties or forms of\nactivity unimpaired ; that as regards mental content he became\nas a newborn babe, while as regards the forms of activity and his\ninherited dispositions and aptitudes, his instincts and reflex actions,\nhe suffered no appreciable loss, and remained an adult of well-\ndeveloped mental powers. But a difficulty meets us when we pursue\nfurther this line of explanation. If we could assume that all acquired\nassociations were simply and completely dissolved, we could then\nexplain the great facility with which he acquired and retained\npowers of movement and impressions and ideas of all kinds, a\n\fLI.] Reviews. 351\nfacility far exceeding that of a young child, as due to the fact that\nhis brain contained an immense number of fully formed nerve-\nelements ready to enter into associations, whereas in the brain of\nthe young child these elements are for the most part imperfectly\norganised, and only gradually become capable of playing their part\nas members of the systematically organised groups of elements.\nBut the fact that Mr. Hanna eventually recovered his memory of\nhis former life shows that the acquired associations were not destroyed,\nbut suffered only a temporary functional depression ; hence the\nauthors assume that the extreme rapidity of the reacquisition of the\npower of co-ordinated movement, of the use of language, and of\nideas in general was due to the fact that associations had not to be\nformed de novo, but only to be restored by use to a condition of\nfunctional effectiveness. But the fact that Mr. Hanna acquired\nwith equally astonishing rapidity skill in the playing of musical\ninstruments with which he had before the accident no familiarity\nshows that in this case the acquisition was really a new acquisition,\n\u2014not merely a reawakening of old facilities\u2014and renders it at\nleast possible that the same is true of all his acquisitions in the\nsix weeks following the accident. This view seems to be borne out,.\ntoo, by the fact of the formation after the accident of a completely\nindependent memory-continuum. If the acquisition of facilities and\nideas after the accident consisted merely in a restoration of structures\npreviously formed to a condition of efficiency we should expect ta\nhave observed a gradual reawakening of the lost memories, a\ngradually improving recognition of previously familiar persons and\nobjects. But nothing of this sort was observed. The lost memory-\ncontinuum was recovered suddenly and completely and the new-formed\nmemory-continuum persisted contemporaneously with it ; and the two,.\nbeing discontinuous, and yet both having that character of warmth\nand intimacy which belongs to the reproductions of past experiences,\nseemed to constitute two past selves each claiming continuity with\nthe present self.\nIf we could accept the view that the two cerebral hemi\nspheres function in large part independently, and that one\nmay be dormant and undeveloped, while the other becomes the\nstore-house of acquisitions, then we might suppose that after the\naccident the former had been called into activity and had become\neducated and organised. That this may occur in a very partial\ndegree is proved by certain cases of recovery of speech depending\nupon organisation of a speech centre in the right hemisphere after\n7.\n\f352 If. McDmigatt. [PART\n\u2022complete destruction of Broca's area in the left hemisphere. Bat\nthat the one hemisphere may normally be so latent as to afford a\nsatisfactory explanation of this remarkable case is improbable.\nPerhaps we should rather look to the evidence, to which some\n-authorities attach great importance, indicating that in most of us\na large proportion of the cells of the cortex of both hemispheres\nremain throughout life outside the functioning systems and practi\ncally unused.\nThe case may be interpreted in another than the purely physio\nlogical manner. It may be held that in the remarkable separation in\nthis case of the form and the content of mental process we have evidence\nthat, while the content depends upon the systems of associated\nneural elements built up in the course of individual experience,\nand is therefore liable to be temporarily or permanently abolished\nby a physical shock to the brain substance, the forms of mental\nactivity are not dependent upon nervous organisation but purely\nupon the psychical constitution of the individual, a constitution\nwhich being immaterial is not to be destroyed by an injury to the\nbrain. We should then have to regard the difference between\na new-born child and Mr. Hanna after the accident as due to the\nfact that the former has an insufficent mass of fully developed\nneural elements to permit of the rapid organisation of complex\nsystems conditioning a mental content rapidly growing in volume\nand complexity and giving scope and occasion for the higher forms\nof mental activity, while in the brain of the latter such a supply\nof neural elements was present, only awaiting the incidence of sense-\nimpressions to become organised de novo as the material conditions\nof the new memory-continuum under the guidance of the unimpaired\npsychical constitution. And in support of this interpretation one\nmight put to those who would adopt the former purely physiological\nline of explanation, the question : \" What then is that something\nwhich watched and suffered and strove to decide the issue in that\nstrange contest for predominance between the two memory-continua\nand which ultimately adopted them both as its own past experience '\nThis case of alternating personality is especially interesting from\nthe point of view of psychical research in that its issue in recovery\nwith fusion of the two personalities puts out of court the explanation\nby the hypothesis of possession or \" spirit-control,\" which has been\nsuggested in regard to some other cases, notably in that of Lurancy\nVannum (see Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 65 and pp. 360-68), where\n\u2022explanation was generally accepted by the persons who wit\n\fLI.] Reviews. 353\nnessed the phenomena at the time. The evidence adduced for it\nwould indeed seem strong, but for the fact that little, if any, pre\ncaution appears to have been taken to guard against the patient's\nacquiring by normal means knowledge of incidents in the life of\nthe girl whom she was supposed to be personating. The case is\nnevertheless a remarkable one, and those who regard it as one of\n'\u2022spirit-control\" may naturally be inclined to extend the explanation\nto all instances of alternating personality. So long as no instance of\nfusion of the two or more personalities was known this remained\npossible. In this case the explanation is clearly not applicable, and\ntherefore those who adopt it for cases of the Lurancy Vennum type\nmust recognise that not all cases can be brought into this class;\nthey must recognise two distinct and very different kinds of alter\nnating personality.\nOf great interest to members of the S.P.R. is the statement that\nMr. Hanna soon after the accident exhibited powers of clairvoyance,\nin that \" he was able to find objects hidden from him, and was\nuniformly correct in guessing in which hand a small coin was held,\"\nand that \"In like manner the straps with which he was bound\nafter the accident he invariably located, in spite of the fact that\nhis family made every effort to conceal them, since their presence\nagitated him.\" It is significant of the attitude of men of science\ntowards the work of the S.P.R. that these statements are relegated\nto a footnote and that the authors do not seem to have considered\nthem worthy of investigation, though accepting them as evidence of\nthe sensitiveness of the secondary personality.\nThe rest of the book is occupied with theoretical discussions of a\nsomewhat confusing character, illustrated by the citation of other\nmorbid cases, some of which are of great interest. The authors claim\nthat their successful treatment of the case of Mr. Hanna constitutes\na verification of their theoretical interpretation. But though they\ncertainly may claim credit for skilful treatment, it must remain\ndoubtful, as so often in medical practice, to what extent the treatment\nplayed an essential part in bringing about the recovery.\nW.

HENRY SIDGWICK.\nIK the death of Richard Hodgson, which occurred quite\nsuddenly and unexpectedly on the 20th of December, 1905,\nthe Society for Psychical Research has lost a member who\nmust always occupy a prominent place in its annals. He not\nonly took an important share in its work, but almost from\nits foundation he determined to give his life to the questions\nwith which it is concerned, regarding this investigation as\none of the most important objects to which the human mind\nand human energy could be devoted, and therefore one to\nwhich worldly ambitions should be cheerfully sacrificed.\nRichard Hodgson was born at Melbourne in Australia in\n1855, was educated in the public schools there, and after\nwards entered the Melbourne University where he took the\ndegrees of M.A. and LL.D. His intention had been to\ndevote himself to the Law, but he was diverted from this\napparently by the study of philosophy and the interest it\ninspired, and it was probably with a view to pursuing his\nphilosophical studies that he came to England. He entered\nthe University of Cambridge as a student at St. John's\nCollege in 1878, and read for the Moral Sciences Tripos, in\nwhich he took honours in 1881. It was characteristic of\nhim that, having thus qualified for a degree, his friends had\nsome difficulty in persuading him to take it, because the\nceremony involved kneeling to the Vice-Chancellor, and he\ndid not wish to bend the knee to any man. After com\npleting his Cambridge course he studied for a time at the\nUniversity of Jena in Germany, and on returning to England\n\fLII.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 357\ntook part in University extension lecturing in the North of\nEngland. As a student of the Moral Sciences he was naturally\nbrought into contact at Cambridge with Henry Sidgwick, who\nbesides lecturing made a practice of going over his pupils'\nwork with them individually, and thus saw a good deal of\nthem. The friendship and regard for each other first formed\nbetween the two men in the relation of teacher and pupil\nwas a lasting one.\nThe philosophic writer in whom Mr. Hodgson felt most\ninterest, and with whom he was most disposed to agree at\nthis time, was Herbert Spencer, on whom he both wrote and\nlater lectured at Cambridge. But he was not consciously a\nfollower of Herbert Spencer or of any other philosopher.\nIndeed he was always a man of great independence of mind,\nwith an almost inconvenient dislike of following others. It\nwas, 1 suppose, to give relief to this feeling, and as a symbol\nof his desire to take an independent line, that he adopted\nwhile at Cambridge an evening dress suit of brown cloth\ninstead of the ordinary black one. This becoming but eccen\ntric costume he discontinued after some years, realising,\ndoubtless, that it is not worth while expending energy in\ndiverging from custom in unimportant details.\nMr. Hodgson's interest in the objects investigated by our\nSociety had already begun in Australia, and at Cambridge\nhe took an active part in an undergraduate society formed\nto investigate some of them. This society had but a brief\nexistence, and did not obtain any satisfactory results ; but i\ndoubtless helped to prepare him for what was ultimately to\nbe his life's work, and when the Society for Psychical\nResearch was founded in 1882 he became one of its earliest\nmembers.1\nHow early he took an active part in its work and its\ncouncils I am not quite sure, but in 1884, when a keen\ninterest was being taken in England in Madame Blavatsky\nand her Theosophical Society, Mr. Hodgson was co-opted as a\nmember of the Committee appointed to investigate the marvels\nalleged to occur in connection with Theosophy. These phe\nnomena were in many respects analogous to those said to occur\nat spiritualistic stances\u2014e.g. the transportation even through\n1 His name appears in the first published list of members.\n\f358 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PART\nsolid matter of ponderable objects. Mr. Hodgson was sent\nout by. the Committee in November, 1884, to investigate the\nphenomena in India, where they chiefly occurred. Before he\nstarted considerable doubt had been thrown by revelations\nof confederates and otherwise on the genuineness of Madame\nBlavatsky's occult powers and on the existence of the Tibetan\nMahatmas with whom she professed to work. But this did\nnot detract from the merit of Mr. Hodgson's work, which\nincluded, of course, among other things, an investigation into\nthe trustworthiness of the assertions made by the confederates,\nand which was carried out with much care and acumen, and\nwith a praiseworthy thoroughness patent to all who read\nhis report.1 The result was that finally he had no doubt\nwhatever that the phenomena connected with the Theosophical\nSociety were part of a huge fraudulent system worked by\nMadame Blavatsky with the assistance of confederates, and\nthat not a single genuine phenomenon could be found among\nthem all. And this, after receiving Mr. Hodgson's report, was\nthe conclusion also of the Committee, though they expressed\nit in more guarded language.\nDuring this visit to India Mr. Hodgson greatly developed,\nif he did not actually acquire, the interest in all kinds of\nconjuring performances and ingenious tricks and puzzles which\nbecame so characteristic of him, and which on many occasions\nserved him well in enabling him to unmask trickery in con\nnection with phenomena alleged to be occult. I have still\na number of puzzles which he gave me at this time, and\nremember the pleasure he took in making me unravel them.\nIn the course, too, of his investigation into the Theosophical\nphenomena he made himself an expert in handwriting,\napplying his skill especially in connection with the so-called\nKoot Hoomi letters, said to have been written and\nmysteriously conveyed to the recipients by a Mahatma residing\nin Tibet, but really for the most part written by Madame\nBlavatsky herself in a disguised hand. Mr. Hodgson was\nundoubtedly a man of great power of observation and acute\ninference, which he combined with an unusually genial and\nenthusiastic nature. I was a good deal associated with him\nin the work of investigation at this time, and well remember\n1 Proceeding!, S.P.R., Vol. III., pp. 207-380.\n\fLII.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 359\nwhat an inspiriting fellow-worker these qualities, together with\nhis vigour and energy and keen interest, made him.\nThe Blavatsky investigation proved purely destructive, and\nMr. Hodgson's powers were often afterwards applied to\nnecessary but destructive work in exposing trickery.1 But it is\nnot for his destructive work that the Society owes him most\ngratitude. The next important piece of work he undertook\u2014\nnamely, an experimental investigation in conjunction with Mr.\nS. J. Davey into the possibilities of mal-observation and lapse of\nmemory in connection with phenomena such as those which\noccur at stances\u2014though from one point of view destructive\nis from another constructive, establishing psychological data\nof great importance for the estimation of evidence in\npsychical research. This investigation, of which the results\nare contained in two papers in our Proceedings? is probably\nMr. Hodgson's most original work. It is certainly a contribution of\nlasting value to the work of the Society, and one which cannot\nbe ignored by any one seriously desiring to estimate evidence\nfor phenomena not apparently in accordance with the known\nlaws of nature, and in regard to which there is any possibility\nof conscious or unconscious deception. It was, however, after\nhe went to America that, through the work he did with Mrs.\nPiper, Mr. Hodgson first added to the positive evidence for\nthe reality of supernormal phenomena.\nIn 1887 he was invited to go to the United States of\nAmerica as secretary to the American Society for Psychical\nResearch, and with reluctance made up his mind to leave\nEngland and his friends here for the purpose. He held the\noffice till in 1890 that Society converted itself into a Branch\nof the English Society, and then retained a similar position\nas secretary of the Branch. He soon made friends in\nAmerica, and transferring his affections to that country came\nto regard it as his home. Only once did he return to\nEngland except for brief visits. In 1897 an effort was\n1 E.g. in the case of the greater part of Eusapia Paladino's work at Cambridge\nin 1895.\n*\" The Possibility's of Mal-observution and Lapse of Memory from a Practical\nPoint of View \" (Experimental investigation by S.

He resided in England for a year from the\nautumn of 1897, and served as a member of the Council\nand Editor of the Proceedings and Journal. But the attraction\nof America and of the work in America was too strong.\nHe returned there in 1898, intending that it should be\nfor a time only ; but he could not tear himself away, and\nwhen this became evident to him in 1S99 he resigned the\npost of Editor. Meanwhile his constant interchange of views\nwith Mr. Myers resulted in a close approximation on theoretical\npoints between them, probably through modifications and\ndevelopments on both sides ; and after Mr. Myers died leaving\nhis book Human Personality only partly in print, it fell to\nMr. Hodgson, in co-operation with Miss Johnson, to complete\nand edit what was unfinished.\nWhen Mr. Hodgson went to America in 1887 he found\nmembers of the Society there, especially Professor William\nJames, already interested in the trance phenomena of Mrs.\nPiper. He immediately began work with her, and was soon\nso much interested that the investigation became hence\nforward his most absorbing work, and was only intermitted\nduring short intervals till his death. It was in consequence\nof his and Professor James's reports that Mrs. Piper was\ninvited to England in 1889, but though the reports of the\nEnglish sittings were ready for publication first,1 it will be\nremembered that Mr. Hodgson's report, published in 1892\n(Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., pp. 1-167), contains records\nof earlier work. It is, of course, only a small proportion of\nthe Piper evidence which seems to require the hypothesis of\ncommunication with the dead ; for even when the trance-\npersonality exhibits knowledge which it is difficult to suppose\notherwise than supernormally acquired, thought-transference\nbetween living persons will generally suffice to account for\nit. It was therefore natural that Mr. Hodgson should only\ngradually arrive at the momentous conclusion (expressed in\nhis second report on Mrs. Piper, published in 18982), that\n1 Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., pp. 436-659.\n2Proceedinga S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 284-582. Not only Mr. Hodgson's own\npapers on Mrs. Piper, but those of Professor W. Romaine Newbold (Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. XIV., pp. 6-49) and of Professor Hyslop (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.\nXVI.) are based on evidence obtained largely with Mr. Hodgson's assistance.\n\fLII.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 361\nthe chief \" communicators \" through Mrs. Piper were \" veritably\nthe personalities that they claim to be, that they have\nsurvived the change we call death, and that they have\ndirectly communicated with us whom we call living through\nMrs. Piper's entranced organism.\" 1 Whether he would have\nadmitted any modification to this statement in later years\nI do not know, but there is no doubt that to the end he\nretained his belief in the broad fact that we have empirical\nevidence of the survival of the dead and of their power\nunder certain circumstances to communicate with the living,\nand that he held this belief with a strength of conviction\nwhich probably nothing could have shaken. Some of the\nevidence on which the belief was founded is set forth in\nthe above-mentioned report, but, as must almost always happen\nin such cases, the evidence that could be published is not the\nwhole of what served to convince Mr. Hodgson and others who\nknew the deceased persons supposed to be- communicating, nor\nindeed is the whole of it capable of being put down in writing.\nIt is, of course, of great importance that any conclusions\nthat may be drawn from Mrs. Piper's trance utterances should\nbe supported by investigation into the automatic speaking and\nwriting of other sensitives, and it is to be regretted that\nMr. Hodgson did not give some of the time devoted in later\nyears to Mrs. Piper to looking into other cases. We must\nregret, moreover, that he has left us without bringing into\norder the mass of still unpublished material he had collected in\nsittings with Mrs. Piper in these later years\u2014material of which\nthe value 'is at present unknown. But whatever this material\nwhen examined may reveal, and whether it can be made use\nof publicly or not, it is certain that the labours of Mr. Hodgson\nhave given to the world an important record of developments\nof trance speaking and writing observed with Mrs. Piper\nthrough a long series of years. It is certain, too, that this\nrecord includes a considerable amount of evidence for the\nacquisition of knowledge in some supernormal manner by the\ntrance personality ; and, more important still, it undoubtedly\ncontains evidence which cannot be ignored, and which Mr.\nHodgson himself regarded as conclusive, for the possibility of\ncommunication between the dead and the living.\n1 Proceedings Vol. XIII., p. 406.\n\f362 J. 0.

For his\nown happiness it was probably well that the middle period\nwas the briefest of the three, for it was only in the freer,\nbreezier social climates of his first and last homes, and especially\nin \" the large and charitable air \" of America, that the real\nnature of the man blossomed forth. In the conventional and\nreserved atmosphere of England he must often have been ill\nat ease, and was certainly not at his best, and he felt\nhimself, I believe, \" cabin'd, cribb'd, confined.\"\nPartly for this reason, and partly by reason of his long\nabsence, some engaging sides of his character were little, if\nat all, known to us in England. I have recently been going\nthrough a mass of his papers, and have been brought into\ncontact with his Boston friends. What I have learnt from\nthese two sources has thrown on Hodgson's character a light\nnew to me, and, as it may be new to others too, I have\nattempted to set down here the impressions I have gathered.\nMrs. Sidgwick is dealing with Hodgson's work as ;\\\nDljrchical researcher.

He was a healthy animal,\nwith an undegenerate appetite for food and exercise and sport\nand open air ; an appetite which kept its keen edge to the\nlast because he never blunted it by over-indulgence or by\nunwholesome fare. He died playing a game, and in the circum\nstance of his death there was nothing inappropriate,\u2014I had\nalmost said that it was characteristic.\nSome of you may have pictured him to yourselves as the\nsevere recluse absorbed in his metaphysical studies, careless,\nif not contemptuous, of all that did not belong to the in\ntellectual or to the spiritual side of life. He was nothing of\nthe sort. He did not\n\" desire in any way\nTo vary from the kindly race of men.\"\nHe was the most sociable of beings. In Dr. Johnson's phrase,\nhe was a \" clubbable man,\" and he was fortunate enough to\nfind at Boston that rare thing, a clubbable club, where he\ngratified this social instinct to the full. He had rooms in\nwhich he slept and breakfasted and worked, but his real home\nwas the Tavern Club : which is not so much a club as a\nHappy Family. He was one of the club's most constant\nhabitues, and, perhaps, its most popular member. If there\nwas any fun going on\u2014and there is no lack of it at the Tavern\n\u2014Hodgson was sure to be, if not the centre, at least in the\ncentre of it. I spoke of his popularity, but a more intimate\nword is needed. To the affection in which he was held by\nhis fellow Taverners more than one of them spoke in my\nhearing, in few words indeed, as befits us Anglo-Saxons, but\nin a tone of shy reserve eloquent of sincere emotion.\nAt the Club he could throw psychical research to the winds\nwith a clear conscience, for by most of his club friends his\n\f364 J. G. Piddington. [PART\ndevotion to it was looked upon as an amiable weakness, a\ncurious streak of crankiness in an otherwise eminently sane\ncharacter, and as a fit subject for pleasantry and chaff; chaff\nwhich Hodgson took with unruffled good humour. And it\nwas well in every way that he was thus almost daily led to\navoid for a few hours all reference, or all but joking reference,\nto a subject from which regular relaxation is essential if sense\nof proportion and sanity of judgment are to be retained.\nYet to a congenial audience or to enquirers who had or\nprofessed a serious desire to learn Hodgson would expatiate\non his own subject with enthusiasm ; and a singularly retentive\nmemory enabled him to illustrate it with a wealth of apposite\nand accurate detail.\nSociety, in the conventional sense, had no attractions for\nhim ; but each summer found him a delighted and a welcome\nguest among a circle of intimate friends in the Adirondack\nMountains or at Bar Harbor. At Putnam's Camp in the\nAdirondacks especially he could indulge to the full his pleasure\nin the companionship of children. He loved children\u2014big\nand little\u2014and they him. With them he became a boy again.\nHe led their games, and the first to tire was never Hodgson.\nWhen he died the first thought of more than one parent was\nnot of their own loss, but \" What will our children do without\nhim ? \"\nPuzzles of all and every kind, and anything akin thereto\u2014\nconjuring-tricks, conundrums, catches, riddles, anagrams, acrostics,\ncryptograms, cyphers\u2014exercised a veritable fascination over him.\nAll of this sort was fish that came to his net.\nFor poetry he had the same omnivorous appetite, as his\nbookshelves testified. Though undoubtedly possessed of true\ntaste, he was a very glutton for anything that had the least\npretence to rime or metre. He would not only read but buy\nthe output of the feeblest of minor poets, rather, I fancy, than\nrun the risk of missing one inspired thought or phrase that\nmight lie lurking among a ream of rubbish.\nNor was poetry his only intellectual recreation. He had\nbeen, if not a profound, at least no superficial student of\nphilosophy. He followed with interest the general progress\nof science, and astronomy had a particular attraction for him.\nLess orthodox\u2014though, as the outside world might think,\n\fL.H.] Rickard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 365\nmore in keeping with his chief pursuit\u2014were a mild sympathy\nwith the anti-vaccinationists and an interest in the Baconian\ncontroversy ; though the latter, I suspect, was traceable rather\nto his leaning towards everything partaking of the nature of\na puzzle than to any serious doubts about the authorship of\nShakespeare's works.\nAs I worked my way through his papers, evidence for this\npenchant for puzzles cropped up at every turn ; and I cannot\ndoubt that it had much to do with determining his career.\nIt must in any case have been one of the chief deciding factors.\nAnother was, I believe, an innate and abiding religious sense.\nIn early life an earnest and active Nonconformist, he, while\nstill a young man, cut himself adrift from his first religious\nmoorings as soon as he realised that he could no longer\nconscientiously and unreservedly accept all the tenets of his\nChurch. Later on he became a disciple of Herbert Spencer.\nBub his soul was always athirst for the water brooks, and\nit must have been with deep satisfaction and relief that\nhe ultimately found in the conclusions which he drew from the\ninvestigations of this Society and chiefly from those he had\nhimself conducted in America an intellectual sanction for his\naspirations.\nGenial and kindly though his nature was, it was not without\nits roughnesses. In controversy he was apt to deal hard\nblows in sledge-hammer style, and his own joy in combat\nblinded him to the fact that his opponent was not necessarily\nas insensitive to castigation as himself.\nOnce his mind was made up he became constitutionally\nunable to appreciate, another point of view, and his strong\nconvictions were accompanied by an almost righteous indig\nnation at the perversity of the other fellow. In other words,\nthough full of fun he was lacking in a sense of humour. He\nwas in deadly earnest in whatever he took up. This dis\nposition made him in his later years impatient of compromise\nor control. He was one of those men who, averse from and\nunsuited for co-operation, work best alone.\nThe detective faculty, which served him so well in the\nsolution of puzzles and usually in his psychical work, would\noccasionally mislead him in the ordinary relations of life\ninto fits of suspiciousness, as comic in their intensity as in\n\f366 J.

On those on whom his suspicious fell he vented\nhis displeasure in no measured terms ; and, however groundless\nhis accusations might be shown to be, it was rarely, if ever,\nthat he would admit himself mistaken. He could pardon,\nfrankly and readily enough, as a rule, though sometimes\ngrudgingly and tardily ; but he found it hard to believe that\nhis flair had been at fault.\nThe competitive instinct, too, was unduly developed. He\nhated being beaten in a game, and he would not admit\ndefeat in an argument. And in each case I think defeat\nwas distasteful for the same reason ; namely, that at bottom\nhe was so firmly convinced that his own side was best that\nwhen it was worsted, or in danger of being worsted, he felt\na sense of injury because the righteous were not inheriting\nthe earth. The promise of this inheritance to the meek must\nhave been to him the hardest of Hard Sayings.\nYet if he played, or wrote, or talked for victory with\nexcessive zeal, I do not believe for one moment that egotism\nwas the cause. He knew his side was in the right, and his\nplain duty was to make that side prevail : a refreshing trait\nin these indifferent days when we lazily incline to hold that\nthere is so much to be said for any side of a question that\nit matters little which gains the day.\nThere was something of a strain of Old Testament vin-\ndictiveness in his make-up. He must, so it seems to me,\nhave had his moments when with the Psalmist he might\nhave cried : \" Of thy goodness slay mine enemies : and destroy\nall them that vex my soul.\" But, mark you, as with the\nPsalmist so with him, his enemies were always the Lord s\nenemies too : though, doubtless, he either was unconscious of\nthe coincidence, or, if he did remark it, was not disturbed\nby it.\nStill there was a very tender side to his character, which\nperhaps came out most fully in his intercourse with those\nwho, raw from some recent bereavement, came for hope or\nconsolation to him, either simply as to one versed in the\nproblem of survival, or, as it were, to the keeper of an\nauthentic door of access to the other world, or even, indeed,\nas to some Hierophant of the Mysteries of life and death.\nTo such as these he gave lavishly of his time, his counsel and\n\fLIi.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriawu. 367\nhis sympathy. They came to meet him half way, it is true,\nbut even so he won their confidence with extraordinary com\npleteness. Many of them poured out their hearts to him\nwithout restraint ; and he, though naturally a man of deep\nreserve where his innermost emotions were concerned, would,\nrepaying confidence with confidence, reveal to them his own most\nintimate experiences and convictions, in the hope of thereby\nlightening the darkness or assuaging the bitterness of their\ndespondency. And he won not only their confidence but\ntheir gratitude also, and often their affection.\nHis failings, such as they were, were the outcome of his\nintense earnestness. His virtues were those of a noble type\nof man.\nIt was a fine life ; manly, simple, single of purpose, and\u2014\nbest of all, perhaps\u2014graced by warm and enduring friendships.\n\f368 M.

Indeed, it was as an explorer of\nthe spiritual realm, an adventurer beyond the bourne from\nwhich he believed the return of travellers could be proved and\nguided, that he was chiefly known to the world at large.\n2\nThrough the last years of his life he was peculiarly identified\nwith the trance sittings of Mrs. Piper and the communications\nfrom the spirit-groups of which he recognized \" Phinuit \" and\n\"Imperator\" as the central figures. Though finally surrender\ning his own life to the direction of \" Imperator,\" he sought to\nretain in his work of interpretation for others the attitude\nof the investigator insisting upon the best of evidence. It\nwas his unflagging desire to accumulate a mass of evidence\nsufficient to form a reasonable hypothesis regarding the \" spirit\nworld.\"\nThere is no lack of pathos, from one point of view, in his\nhaving dropped this work unfinished. From another there is\nthe satisfaction of his having passed quickly, as he wished to\npass, from the present to the future life. More than one of\nhis friends recall the eagerness with which he said only last\nsummer, \" I can hardly wait to die.\" A keen intellectual\ncuriosity regarding what awaited him was his own chief\nconcern about death.

To hear him\ntalk of that \" other side \" as if it were literally a room\nseparated from the house of life only by walls and doors of\nglass, to see him year in and year out devoting to an idea\nintellectual and moral powers which might well have won him\nmany of the rewards which men prize most,\u2014this was to\nrealize in a measure the spirit which has animated the idealists\nof every age, the spirit through which a man saves his life\nby losing it.\nThe general and the personal significance of his work were\nso inextricably twined together that it is hard to discuss it\nat all without seeming to invade the inmost sanctities. Yet\nin this company it is no sacrilege to quote from a private\nletter of 1901 a passage which reveals at once the intense\nconviction of Richard Hodgson's belief and the pure spiritual\nfaith of which it was the embodiment : \" I went through toils\nand turmoils and perplexities in '97 and '98 about the signifi\ncance of this whole Imperator regime, but I have seemed to\nget on a rock after that,\u2014I seem to understand clearly the\nreasons for incoherence and obscurity, etc., and I think that\nif for the rest of my life from now I should never see\nanother trance or have another word from Imperator or his\ngroup, it would make no difference to my knowledge that all\nis well, that Imperator, etc., are all they claim to be and\nare indeed messengers that we may call divine.

In the field of mental\nactivities, there was no one better qualified to discuss the\nfreshest topics of physical science, the events and tendencies\nin the world of affairs, and their deeper significances. There\nwas no one here to whom the pleased discoverer of a new\nminor poet\u2014since the major phenomenon is so rare\u2014could\ncome with such conviction that his discovery had been\nanticipated. Indeed it was no unusual thing to have Dick\nquote you off-hand the new singer's best verses, with all the\nfervour and understanding which made him the favourite inter\npreter of certain of our own poets. One cannot forget how\nhe entered into the reading of other men's verses. No matter\nif there were twenty valentines or prize songs to be read\nin a single evening, every one of them rang out in his loyal\nvoice as heartily as if Dick himself were the author, bent\nupon bringing forth every particle of meaning or wit the\nlines might contain. His intimate association with the more\nserious muse will be a recurring remembrance to most of us,\nwhen Christmas and New Year come round without the card\nwhich brought us his poetic greeting, in which an old or a\nnew poet seemed merely the mouthpiece of the sender's own\nthought.\nNor was this community of interest restricted by any\nmeans to the things of the mind. The healthy Anglo-Saxon\ndevotion to every exhibition of physical prowess was con\nspicuously characteristic of this child of the spirit. The pro\nfessional ball game, the college boat race and football battle\nexcited his keenest interest ; and it was like him to double\nhis enjoyment in these sports by the companionship of one or\nmore of us. The cheery call for volunteers for the 2.20 boat\nmust remain one of the brightest memories of our summer\nlunch-table, not only for those who used to join the almost\ndaily expeditions to Nantasket, and huddled into their clothes\nwhile Dick's head was still a mere speck amongst the ocean\nsteamers and harbour islands, but for all whose paths led\n\fLII.] Richard Hodgson: in Mermoriam. 371\ninland or to other shores.

In the squash-court Dick was\nthe best and gentlest of antagonists in victory or defeat.\nFrom the gallery above it his initial inquiry, \" Score ? \" his\nrallying shouts\u2014\" two-yard-line,\" \" anybody's game \"\u2014put spirit\ninto the flagging player, and made him happily conscious of\na gallery to which it was no shame to play. Downstairs by\nthe fire-place and at the table above, it was generally Dick\nwho first taught the new member to know himself here by\nhis Christian name, and to feel that gray hairs and youth\nmight after all be contemporaries.\nJust because he was the contemporary of all, the man between\nwhom and the rest of us the barriers were the fewest and\nthe lowest, he typified, perhaps more than any individual\nmember of the club, the spirit of the Tavern. The last\nwords that certain of us heard him speak are a memorable\nillustration of his unique and beautiful place among us.\nEight or ten men were gathered in the lower room\u2014one\ndefending an unpopular cause, which the others were hotly\ndenouncing. The debate was growing acrimonious. Down\nfrom luncheon came Dick. \" Go for the scoundrel,\" he thun\ndered from the stairs. \" Don't give him a chance to speak ;\ndown with him ! Don't let him be heard ! \" The genial shout,\nwith its animating love of fair play as well as of peace,\ndrew a laugh and a response. \" How can anybody be heard\nwhen you're in the room, Dick ? \" There was another laugh\n\u2014and the unpleasantness was past.

BALFOOR.\nLOOKING at the list of past Presidents of our Society I\nuse no mere conventional form of speech when 1 say that\nI am much more sensible of the honour which the Council\nhave done me in asking me to accept the office than of\nany pretensions I possess of fitness to hold it. There is\nhardly one of my distinguished predecessors who has not\ntaken an active and even eminent part in the work of\nPsychical research. I unfortunately can make no such\nclaim. Although a member of the Society almost from the\nyear of its foundation, I must sadly confess that I have\nin no way shared in its labours nor so much as contributed\na single paper to its Proceedings. While others have\nwritten and worked, I have only been able to read and\nponder the evidence which they have accumulated, and even\nthat only in the intervals of a busy life otherwise employed.\nIn these circumstances if I venture to submit to you some\nobiter cogitata of one who has hitherto been a sleeping\npartner in the firm, it is to your kind indulgence that I\nmust trust to carry me through the task.\nOne of our former Presidents has recorded his opinion\nthat the simplest exercise of telepathic influence\u2014the power\nfor instance which some people think they possess of\nmaking others turn' round and look at them by a mere\nexertion of will\u2014would, from the purely scientific point\nof view, if it were really established, be more extraordinary,\nmore mysterious, more worthy to excite intellectual curiosity,\n\f374 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfowr. [PART\nthan the annihilation of the planet on which we live by\ncollision with some hitherto unknown body travelling through\nspace. The latter event, he argued, however dramatically\nextraordinary, would involve no modification or even\nextension of accepted theories regarding the laws which\ngovern the movements of the celestial bodies. On the other\nhand the direct action of one mind on another would seem\nto introduce us to a region ordered according to other laws\nthan those which obtain in any department of experience\nwhich received Science has made its own.\nIn contrast with this statement may be set the emphatic\ndeclaration of Professor Flournoy that if telepathy did not\nexist, it would be necessary to invent it. \"Direct action\"\nhe tells us \" between living beings is a thing so completely\nin harmony with all we know of nature, that it would be\ndifficult not to assume it a priori, even in the absence of\nany perceptible indication of the fact. How is it con\nceivable,\" he goes on to ask, \" that the activity of such\ncomplex seats of chemical phenomena as the nervous centres\nshould not be accompanied by the emission of various\nundulations, X, Y, or Z rays, that pass through the skull\nlike the sun through a pane of glass and proceed to act,\nno matter what the distance, on the corresponding centres\ninside other skulls? The question is merely one of\nintensity.\"\nThese two expressions of opinion seem at first sight in\ndirect conflict ; and no doubt they proceed from very\ndifferent conceptions of the real nature of telepathy and of\nits modus operandi. On the subject of this difference I\nshall have more to say in the sequel. In the meantime\nlet me point out that in a limited sense it is possible to\nreconcile the two views ; for we may admit the extraordinary\nand even epoch-making character of a discovery, and yet\nwhen once it has been made, feel that it fits in with\nmetaphysical or scientific presuppositions in a way that\nought to have made us anticipate and look out for it\nbeforehand.\nIt is doubtless in consequence of some such presuppositions\nthat I have never personally felt oppressed by any sense\nof antecedent improbability in the phenomena of telepathy.\n\fLII.] Presidential Address. 375\nUnlike Professor Flournoy, however, my presuppositions\nhave been metaphysical rather than physical or mechanical ;\nand as in this respect I fancy my case is somewhat\nexceptional, an attempt to approach the subject from this\nstandpoint may not be altogether without freshness or\ninterest for members of the Society.\nOur ordinary conception of the world presented to us in\nexperience represents it as consisting of a multitude of\nindividual existences or things, connected together under\nconditions of space and time. Enquiry into the ultimate\nnature of the elements of reality, and into their relations to\neach other and to the whole of which they are parts, belongs\nadmittedly to the realm of metaphysical speculation. But\neven the simple and unelaborated description I have just\ngiven is saturated with metaphysical ideas. The fact is,\nwe are all of us metaphysicians, even when we are least\naware of the fact. Common sense itself is an inveterate\nmetaphysician, and all that the most gifted philosophic\ngenius can aspire to accomplish is the transmutation of the\ncrude ideas of common sense into something more nearly\napproaching, or perhaps 1 should rather say less hopelessly\nremote from, a clear and coherent system.\nI need hardly say that I have no intention this afternoon\nto ask you to engage in any such enterprise. I do not propose\neither to enter upon a metaphysical discussion or even to\nlay down dogmatically any ideas of my own on the universe\nat large. But as, in every general view of the connection\nof things in a common world, we all practically start with\nsome presuppositions, I shall invite you, in the case of\ncertain presuppositions which I will briefly state, to give\nthem temporary admission to your minds in a purely\nprovisional way, and then to consider in what direction they\nlead us. The ideas for which I ask this favour make no\nclaim to novelty, and are far from being metaphysical\nparadoxes. On the contrary, they may fairly be said to\nhave behind them a very respectable body of philosophic\nauthority.\nConsent then for the moment to assume with me that\nthe world consists of a plurality of individual existences or\nreal things which not only coexist in space and are subject\n\f376 Right Hon. Gerald W. Baifour. [PART\nto changes in time, but also continuously interact with each\nother so as to form a connected system in which each part\nat once determines and is determined by the rest, and a\nchange in each is ipso facto a change in all the others.\nConsent further to admit that centres of psychical activity\nor minds, as well as centres of physical activity constituting\nthe material world, are to be included among these indi\nvidual existences, which accordingly fall into two kinds, in\nappearance at least of disparate nature.\nIt is of course evident that these propositions occupy only a\nfraction of the metaphysical field, and would have to be taken\nas subject to modification and qualification in any attempt to\nfit them into a systematic whole. Even as they stand they\nwill at once suggest to any student of metaphysics a legion of\ndifficult questions, which it is impossible for me to pursue\non this occasion. Volumes have been written upon these\nquestions in the past ; volumes will no doubt be written\non them in the future ; and whether mankind will be more\nsuccessful in reaching a final conclusion than were those\nirrepressible metaphysicians among Milton's fallen angels,\nwho \" found no end in wandering mazes lost,\" when dis\ncussing similar topics, is a matter on which I should not like\nto express a confident opinion.\nIf however this uncertainty be objected to my present\nprocedure, I reply with the double plea already advanced.\nIn the first place, thinking beings cannot really rid them\nselves of metaphysical presuppositions, however much they\nmay deceive themselves into thinking this to be possible.\nIn the second place I do not ask you to accept these particular\npresuppositions as either true or adequate, but only to adopt\nthem provisionally as working hypotheses. As such it may\nperhaps be counted in their favour, that on the whole they\ncorrespond more closely to common-sense beliefs than do\nmost metaphysical constructions, and further that they may\npossibly be found, as we advance, to have an unexpectedly\nsuggestive bearing on the phenomena of telepathy with which\nI am concerned in this Address.\nIt is to this application of them that I proceed.\n\\ world of reciprocal determination in which each element\nis conceived as acting upon and being acted upoa\n\fMl.] Presidential Address. 377\nby every other, must evidently, if any kind of change is\nadmitted into it, form a system in a continuous state of\nprocess. Its condition as a whole at an> t,'iven moment\nwill be at once effect and cause ; effect of its cocdrtioL. u-\na whole in the moment immediately preceding, and cause\n\u2022of its condition as a whole in the moment immediately\nfollowing.\nThis principle of totality in causation must not however\nbe so interpreted as to exclude the possibility of distinguish\nable chains of causal relation between individual elements\n\u2022or groups of elements in accordance with general laws.\nThis is, in fact, a necessary assumption without which the\n-empirical sciences could not advance a single inch. For\nthe whole work of these sciences is to ascertain from\n\u2022experience the particular laws which govern the relations of\ndifferent kinds subsisting between real things, and therefore\npresupposes that such laws exist and are discoverable.\nNow we admit that real things fall into two kinds : on\nthe one side psychical existences or minds ; on the other\nside the physical elements which underlie the material world.\nIt may be that we ought not to represent the distinction as\nabsolute. It may be that every element of reality unites\nin itself a dual aspect, psychical and physical. On this view\nthere would be no mind or soul entirely without physical\nactivity, nor any material element wholly destitute of\npsychical attributes, and the difference between them would\npass into a difference of degree. I wish not to exclude this\npossibility, nor to regard it as inconsistent with our pre\nsupposition.\nBut for my present purpose it is not necessary to soften\naway the distinction between mind and matter in this\nfashion. I am content to accept the disparity, only insisting\nthat it is not to be pushed to the point of denying all\npossibility of interaction between them.\nLet me now carry you a step further. In a world such\nas that which I have asked you to conceive, you cannot\nlegitimately separate existing things from the relations\nbetween them. For those relations belong to, even though\nthey may not exhaust, the essence of the things. Therefore\nto distinguish between kinds of things is to distinguish\n\f378 Right Hon. Gerald W. Bcdfour. [PART\nbetween kinds of relations. If the elements of reality\nfall into two kinds, centres of psychical activity and\ncentres of physical activity, and if every element of reality\ninteracts according to general laws with every other, it\nwould certainly seem that there must be relations of inter\naction between them of at least three kinds, according as the\ninteraction takes place between physical and physical, between\nphysical and psychical, or between psychical and psychical.\nNow interaction between the physical elements of reality\nis generally admitted, and the laws in accordance with which\nit takes place form the subject of the various branches of\nPhysical Science.\nInteraction between the physical and psychical elements\nof reality is not so generally accepted, and the difficulty of\nconceiving any causal relation between matter and mind has\nbeen so strongly felt as to lead to theories which either deny\nthe reality of the one or of the other, or else ascribe the\nundoubted correspondence between body and mind to a\nperpetual miracle or to a pre-established harmony. According\nto our view they reciprocally determine each other : but in\nany case the correspondence itself is admittedly subject to\nlaws ; and the ascertainment of these laws belongs to that\nprovince of psychology which is known as psycho-physics.\nUnder the same general head of interaction between psychical\nand physical existences, a place might have to be found for\nthe phenomena of telaesthesia and telekinesis, should the\nevidence be such as to establish the reality of those phenomena.\nThere remains the question of direct interaction between\npsychical existences. Does such interaction really obtain?\nWill a science of its laws ever come into being?\nThese are questions which our presuppositions drive us to\nask, and to which they seem to suggest, and even to require,\nan affirmative answer. But let me once more remind you,\nI have no desire to dogmatise. Even granting the reasoning\nbe sound, the presuppositions themselves may be erroneous.\nIf however I have succeeded in inducing you to follow me\nthus far, you will understand why it is that speaking for\nmyself I am predisposed to accept the reality of telepathic\nphenomena, and at least to sympathise with Professor\nlournoy, if I cannot go quite the length of agreeing with\nr|\n\fLII.] Presidential Address. 379\nhim, when he says that telepathy would have to be invented\neven if no experiential evidence in favour of it existed.\nYou will also understand that I have been led to this\nconclusion by reasons very different from those which have\nguided the distinguished Professor himself ; and indeed that\nhe and I mean by telepathy very different things. I mean\nby it direct interaction between psychical existences or\nminds. Professor Flournoy also, in the passage I have\nalready quoted, speaks of \" direct action between living\nbeings \" as being completely in harmony with all that is\nknown of nature. But action which is conceived as taking\nplace by means of undulations propagated through a physical\nmedium is not \" direct \" action in the sense in which I use\nthe term. Indeed if it is legitimate to distinguish, as we\nhave agreed to do, between mind and brain, the modus\noperandi of action between mind and mind would be,\naccording to Professor Flournoy's view doubly or trebly\nindirect. First the mind must act upon the nervous centres,\nsecondly the vibrations set up in the nervous centres must\ngive rise to undulations propagated through some physical\nmedium, next these undulations must stimulate the nerve\ncentres in some other brain, and lastly the stimulus applied\nto the nerve centres must translate itself into consciousness\nin the mind attached to that other brain. It is not how\never necessary to press this point. Even if we cover up all\nquestions concerning the relations of mind and body under\nthe convenient term of \" living being,\" we must still insist\nthat psychical action transmitted by means of physical\nmechanism is a very different thing from that immediate\naction between mind and mind which the presuppositions\nfrom which we started have brought us to anticipate.\nImmediate action between mind and mind may have physical\naction as its invariable concomitant ; but this physical action\nwould not, according to the view I have put before you,\nbelong to the special chain of causal relation for which we\nalways look when we are seeking to understand a phenomenon\nby referring it to general laws. In other words it would\nbe in the nature of a side-effect, much as noise accompanies\nthe discharge of a rifle but is properly not regarded as the\ncause of the propulsion of the bullet. ,.-\u00bb\u2014-\n\f380 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART\nEven at the risk of being unnecessarily tedious, I do not\nlike to leave this topic without once more guarding myself\nagainst a possible misconception. I am afraid I may have\nproduced in some of you the impression that I am trying\nto give a metaphysical proof of the truth of telepathy. That\nis not so. What I have done is to take certain metaphysical\npresuppositions, which on general grounds seem to me worthy\nof provisional acceptance, and shew, or attempt to shew,\nthat some direct interaction between psychical existences is\ninvolved in the implications which they contain. It is\nnatural to suppose that one form at all events which such\ninteraction may take, will be the communication of thoughts\nand feelings and impulses and inhibitions from one centre of\nconsciousness to another. When we find that there is a con\nsiderable body of evidence drawn from experience that com\nmunication of this nature otherwise than through the recognised\nchannels of sense actually occurs, the fact that this evidence\nharmonises with any preconceived idea we may have formed\ninevitably and legitimately tells in its favour. But no d\npriori chain of reasoning can take the place of experience\nin a matter of this kind. It may safely be affirmed that in\nthe complete absence of all evidence from experience that\nsuch a phenomenon has ever occurred, we should, in spite\nof Professor Flournoy, either not think it necessary to invent\ntelepathy, or if we did invent it on grounds of .a priori\nprobability, we should certainly not consider it worth while\nto carry our speculations on the subject very far. We cannot\nhope to rest the proof of telepathy on any other ground than\nthat of solid fact. I am prepared to go yet further, and\nto admit that we must look to experience not only for proof\n\u2022of the truth of telepathic communication between mind and\nmind, but also for the solution of difficult questions concerning\nthe true nature of the phenomenon such as those on which\nI have the misfortune not to see eye to eye with Professor\nFlournoy. He takes one view of the subject ; I am disposed\nto take another; but we should, I think, both of us have\nto confess that our difference of opinion depends more on\nthe presuppositions with which we start, and less upon\nobserved facts than either of us could desire.\nwe then to conclude that there is no room left for\n\fLIi.] Presidential Address. 381\nspeculative consideration of the subject and that no useful\npurpose can be served by it?

In the first\nplace our readiness to receive evidence in support of what\nis strange and unfamiliar will always depend in some degree\nupon the antecedent probability or improbability which our\nminds instinctively attach to it : and this again upon the\nease or difficulty which the new idea has in fitting in with\nthe rest of our mental furniture. I am quite conscious\nthat speculations of the kind in which I have indulged to-day\nhave had considerable weight in my own case, and it is\npossible there may be some others like-minded with myself.\nThere is also another consideration to be taken into account.\nIt is true that the sciences draw their material from\n\u2022experience. But the further each science pushes the limits\nof enquiry, the more it tends to pass beyond into the region\nof metaphysics. Even the physical sciences have yielded to\nthis tendency ; it is still more marked in psychology ; it is\npractically inevitable in that department of psychology which\nspecially interests this Society and which has been baptised,\nnot very happily perhaps, with the name of Metapsychics.\nLet me give you two or three illustrations of this tendency\nfrom among many that might be cited. The question of\nthe possibility of action at a distance has long been a\nstumbling block to physicists. Most physicists deny the\npossibility altogether, apparently on a priori grounds. At all\n-events the denial cannot as yet claim the universal and\nunequivocal support of experience even as regards the\nmaterial world. Now the question whether in any particular\ncase or class of cases the action of one body on another can\nbe shewn to be exerted by transmission through a con\ntinuous medium would certainly seem to be one for physicists\nto determine. But the dogma that action at a distance is\ninconceivable appears to me, I confess, to involve meta\nphysical considerations even if confined to physical action,\nand certainly involves metaphysical considerations if uni\nversally applied to real existences in general.\nI have given you an illustration derived from Physics.\nIf we want one drawn from psychology there is no need to\n.go beyond a topic already touched upon in this address.\n\f382 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART\nYou have only to open any work on psychology which is\nnot content with a purely superficial treatment of the subject,\nto see how difficult and almost impossible psychologists find\nit to avoid raising the question of the existence and nature\nof the Soul. They may make a gallant effort to eliminate\nit, but it pervades and colours all their speculations\nnotwithstanding.\nLet me cite yet another instance, taken from that region\nof enquiry which more especially concerns the Society for\nPsychical Research. There is probably no subject which more\nkeenly interests a majority of our members than that of\nthe rational grounds for a belief in immortality. But how\nfar can the investigations of the Society throw light on the\nproblem of immortality? Clearly only to a limited extent.\nIt may be possible to obtain evidence from experience\nsufficient to convince us that a centre of conscious activity\ncarrying on memories of our corporeal existence does in\ncertain cases survive the dissolution of the body. But this\nis by no means equivalent to proof of the immortality of\nthe Soul ; of which indeed it is evident from the nature of\nthe case we can have no experience whatever. Proof of\nsurvival after bodily death of a conscious self retaining\nmemories of the living personality may, and in fact must,\nhave an important bearing on the larger question, especially\nin the way of removing difficulties and objections. But\nany rational ground of belief in the immortality of the\nSoul must in the end be speculative and result from the\ngeneral view we take of the meaning and purpose of the\nuniverse as an intelligible system.\nDo not suppose that I call attention to the tendency of\nthe sciences to pass over into metaphysics in order to\ncondemn it. On the contrary, I believe it to be both\ninevitable and right. It seems to be more than probable\nthat Metaphysics and Science are destined in the future to\ndraw nearer and nearer together ; that Science will find it\nmore and more necessary to examine its fundamental\nconceptions in the light of metaphysical considerations, and\nthat Metaphysics on the other hand must be prepared for\ncontinual revision of its constructions with reference to the\n\u2022\"\u00ab\"\u2022 accumulating stores of knowledge derived from experi\n\fLIL] Presidential Address. 383\nence. Each will in this way suggest problems to the other,\nand each contribute its help towards their solution.\n\u2022j\nI have now laid before you my justification for the pro\ncedure which I have adopted in this address. Shall I be\ndeemed overbold if in the remainder of the time at my\ndisposal I try to provide you with a practical example of\nthe kind of co-operation between metaphysics and science\nwhich I have in my mind?\nThere are certain problems connected with telepathy, which\nany one approaching the subject as I have done from the\nmetaphysical side is bound to face. He who proceeds step\nby step in pursuit of empirical fact is not called upon to\ngo beyond bare affirmation of that which observation has\nestablished. But the moment he begins to theorise, especially\nif he attempts to shew grounds for anticipating that particular\nphenomena will occur, something more is necessary. He\nmast be prepared to shew not merely that the phenomena\ndo sometimes occur, but also that they occur in every case\nin which their occurrence was to be anticipated in accordance\nwith the theory. Or if he cannot do this, at least he must\nbe prepared with some explanation which accounts for\napparent exceptions to the rule. The fact that communica\ntions of impressions, feelings, and impulses do occur between\nliving beings otherwise than through the recognised channels\nof sense will probably be accepted without demur in this\naudience ; and perhaps I may be permitted on this occasion\nto take it for granted. From my point of view, however,\nthat is not enough, and I am bound to ask myself the further\nquestion : Why is the phenomenon, so far as actual experi\nence goes, a comparatively rare and exceptional one? If it\nbelongs to the very essence of minds that they should interact\nwith each other, and if telepathy is the form we should\nnaturally expect such interaction to take, why is it not more\nfrequent? Why indeed is it not universal?\nThe answer I am disposed to give to this question would\nbe that taken in the widest sense telepathy probably is\nuniversal, and that what is rare and exceptional is only our\nrealisation of it. It is quite true that this cannot be proved.\nBut it is to be noticed that the difficulties in the way of\n\f384 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PAKT\nproof arise from the very same causes which would interfere\nto prevent our recognising the universal agency of telepathy\nsupposing it to be universal.\nThe first and most obvious case is that in which the\ninteraction takes place but the psychical effect resulting from\nit either fails to reach the level of consciousness, or at most\namounts to no more than an obscure modification of the total\npsychical content, and cannot be analysed out as one of the\ndistinguishable and definite components of that content.\nThe notion of a psychical impression which does not reach\nthe level of consciousness may seem a strange one ; but we are\ndriven to it, at all events as a limiting conception, the moment\nwe admit degrees of distinctness and indistinctness in conscious\nimpressions. As regards modifications of the total psychical\ncontent which are too vague and general to allow of particular\nanalysis, it must be remembered that when telepathic com\nmunication takes place, we are not, according to my view,\nto conceive it as the passing over of an impression intact from\none mind to another. On the contrary, what we are dealing\nwith is an interaction between two elements, both of which\nenter as essential factors into the result.\nPassing next to telepathic impressions which do reach the\nlevel of distinct consciousness and are sufficiently definite to\nbe separately distinguishable, it by no means follows that we\nshould be aware of their true origin. Let me mention in\nparticular two classes of such cases, in which telepathic action\nmay be really at work and yet remain entirely unrecognised\neither by the persons affected or by an observer.\nThe ordinary interchange of thought between one indi\nvidual and another is effected by means of signs, which are\nconveyed through the senses of touch, of hearing, or of\nsight. It would be extravagant indeed to suppose that in\nthe case of written signs telepathy plays any part in\nconveying the meaning of the writer to the reader ; but\nare we to assert this also in cases where the communication\nis by word of mouth, by gesture, or by physical contact'.'\nSurely in such cases it is not a wildly improbable conjecture\nto suppose that the indirect communication by signs may\nfind as it were an ally and auxiliary in the direct simultaneous\ninteraction of mind with mind. I am far from affirming\n\fLII.] Presidential Address. 385\npositively that this is so : but some slight support for it\nmay perhaps be derived from observed facts. I may instance\nthe wonderful sway which a great orator is able to exercise\nover an audience, far beyond any influence which the same\nwords uttered by less gifted speakers would exert ; the marked\npreference which even students of dry and difficult subjects\ndisplay (though I confess I never shared it myself), for\noral over written discourse ; the striking facility exhibited\nby very young children in grasping the meaning of words\nwhich they hear for the first time ; the apparently similar\nresults obtained iu certain hypnotic cases, when a transition\nis made from the uttered word of command to purely\nmental suggestion. In the case of animals again it may be\nworth while to notice in this connection the surprising\nintelligence which many dogs show in interpreting the\nslightest indication given by their masters ; the quickness\nof the very young offspring of certain animals to understand\nand obey the different notes of warning or encouragement\nsounded by the parent ; the apparent simplicity of the signs\nemployed by members of insect communities compared with\nthe complexity of their social life. No doubt it may seem\nfanciful to trace telepathy in all this : but even so, the\npoint I wish to emphasize remains, namely, that in every\ncase in which communication by means of sounds, gesture,\nor physical contact takes place the contributory action of\ntelepathy is possible, and yet, even if actual, would probably\nescape notice and certainly elude proof, because masked and\nhidden from observation behind the more obvious role played\nby the ordinary machinery of communication.\nA second class of cases in which telepathic action may\nform , or help to form , conscious impressions , and yet altogether\nfail of recognition, is of greater importance and interest.\nOur ordinary sense perceptions carry with them a direct\nreference to real objects outside of us, and reflection enables\nus to distinguish between our subjective impressions and the\nobjects which we know by means of these impressions, and\nwhich we regard as in some sense giving rise to them. But\nthere are other states of consciousness which carry with them\nno such external reference, and which we treat as purely\nsubjective states without cognitive significance. Can any o'\n\f386 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. |>art\nthese states, which we are accustomed to look upon as purely\nsubjective, be really, in part or in whole, the expression of\nthe direct action of other minds upon our own?\nIf so, the field for undetected telepathic action is evidently\nvery wide indeed. For such subjective states form a large\npart of the stream of consciousness in both the waking\nand dreaming life of each of us. Impressions keep stream\ning through the mind apparently unsummoned by any\nconscious act of will ; yet their telepathic origin , if they\nhad one, might remain forever concealed in the absence of\nany sign which gave either an immediate assurance of the\nfact or else a basis from which it might be inferred.\nThe truth is that for a case of spontaneous, as opposed\nto experimental, telepathy to be even suspected, the first\nrequisite is that the impression should be of a striking\ncharacter, an incongruous intrusion into the stream of\nconsciousness, and for that very reason exceptional. Or if\nthis arresting character is absent, its place must be supplied\nby a precision of coincidence such as is artificially provided\nin experimental telepathy, and this again is exceptional.\nI submit then that the comparative rarity of instances in\nwhich telepathy is suspected, let alone proved, does not\njustify a conclusion as to the rarity of the phenomenon itself.\nIt may be common, nay universal (if we include under the\nname of telepathy cases in which though a real psychical\ninteraction may take place , its effects are too weak to rise above\nthe threshold of distinct consciousness), and yet it may escape\ndetection. After all gravitation is universal in the material\nworld, yet civilised mankind had lived and thought for many\nhundred years in blissful unconsciousness of the fact that\nany connection existed between the fall of an apple to the\nground and the majestic motion of the heavenly bodies.\nIf telepathy be universal there is yet another aspect of\nit of which account must be taken. So far, both in experi\nmental telepathy and in recorded cases of spontaneous\ntelepathy, the interaction has generally been confined to a\nsingle agent and a single percipient. There are a certain\nnumber of cases in which a telepathic impression appears\nto have been received by more than one percipient simul\ntaneously ; and there may be a few in which the evidence\n\flii.] Presidential Address. 387\npoints to joint agency. The rapport already referred to\nbetween great orators and their audiences may possibly be\nin some degree telepathic. It is also conceivable that the\nmysteriously rapid diffusion of important news over large\nareas, of which strange tales come to us from the East and\nelsewhere , is to be referred to a similar origin ; and the\nsame may be true of certain of the phenomena that often\naccompany religious revivals. On the whole, however, it\nis safe to say that in the clear and unmistakeable cases of\ntelepathic communication actually known to us, very few, and\nfor the most part only two, individuals have been concerned.\nI should like to connect with this observation a further\none concerning the character and content of telepathic\nimpressions as exhibited in our evidential cases. These\nimpressions almost always shew a marked character of\nparticularity. They consist of definite sensations, impulses,\nmental pictures or externalised hallucinations. Even when\nthey can properly be described as ideas, they are usually\nideas of a definite and concrete event or series of events ;\nrarely abstract and general ideas. Some exceptions may be\nfound in certain cases of automatic writing, and perhaps also\nin trance utterances ; but these are not sufficient to invalidate\nthe general rule.\nNow these two characteristics of the evidential cases of\ntelepathy I put together because I believe there is a real\nconnection between them. All direct evidence of telepathic\naction is based on some proved correspondence between the\ncontents of different minds which it is not possible either to\nregard as accidental or to account for by communication\nthrough the ordinary channels of the senses. The more\nminute and detailed the coincidence, the more telling it will\nbe for evidential purposes. In this respect particular and\nconcrete impressions would appear to have an advantage over\ngeneral and abstract ideas. But is it likely that particular\nand concrete impressions will arise from the telepathic inter\naction of a multitude of minds? So far as I am aware, little,\nif any, light has been thrown upon this question by any\nexperimental results to which we can appeal ; but upon broad\ngrounds of probability I should be disposed to answer it in\nthe negative, unless for some reason or another a given\n2c\n\f388 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART\nparticular impression is already present in a considerable\nproportion of the minds concerned. Accordingly, if telepathic\ninteraction belongs to the essence of all minds, it seems not\nunreasonable to draw two further conclusions. First, that\nmost, if not all, evidential cases of telepathy are likely to be\ncases in which a special and exceptional telepathic responsive\nness or rapport has been established\u2014we do not yet know\nhow, save that a particular direction of attention and will\nseem to have something to do with it\u2014between a limited\nnumber of individual minds ; and secondly, that if an all-\nembracing psychical interaction can anywhere be traced, it\nis in the region of universals that we must expect to find it.\nWe often speak of ideas being \" in the air \" ; and the\ncommon tendency of thought in particular epochs has been\nso marked as even to lead to the personification\u2014with more\nor less of conscious metaphor\u2014of a Zeitgeist to account for\nit. This is of course mere mythology. Whatever of mystery\nthe phenomenon in question may still present, after more\nobvious explanations have been exhausted, can be more\nsatisfactorily explained by reciprocal telepathic action between\nmany contemporaneous minds. But there is a region of ideas\nbeyond these passing phases of opinion and sentiment. What\nof the ultimate constitutive notions which lie at the foundation\nof all knowledge, making a common universe for our common\nreason? What of the moral ideas which bind mankind\ntogether, and cause us to be members one of another? Is it\ntoo wild a flight of speculative fancy to imagine that these\nare in some sort sustained and ever more and more fully\nrealised through the direct intercommunion of all spiritual\nbeings, and that telepathy in its highest aspect is an actively\nunifying principle leading us upwards and onwards, the\nmanifestation in the world of spirits of the supreme unity of\nthe Divine Mind?\nThe theme is a tempting one for the metaphysician. But\nit is difficult breathing at such elevations. Let us be content\nwith less high matters, and direct our course again towards\nearth.\nUnder the guidance of the presuppositions from which we\nagreed to start, we have been brought to the idea of\n\fLII.] Presidential Address. 389\ntelepathy as the universal form of interaction between\npsychical existences, and even, it may be, the fundamental\nbond of unity and principle of development within the entire\nspiritual world. Let us now take up the clue once more,\nand following where it leads the way, try if we cannot\ndiscover yet another region in which telepathic agency,\nthough its presence there has hitherto been unsuspected, may\nnone the less be found to play an all-important part.\nThe region I refer to is that of the human personality\nitself. In the monumental work which he bequeathed to\nthis Society and to the world Frederic Myers tells us that\nhe regards each man as at once \" profoundly unitary and\nalmost infinitely composite, as inheriting from earthly\nancestors a multiplex and ' colonial ' organism\u2014polyzoic and\nperhaps polypsychic in an extreme degree ; but also as ruling\nand unifying that organism by a soul or spirit absolutely\nbeyond our present analysis.\" With due reserve as to ulterior\nimplications, I for one accept this description so far as it\nrepresents the real self of each of us as one and indivisible,\nbut nevertheless associated in our organism with other centres\nof conscious activity.\nEvidence has been constantly accumulating within recent\nyears of the contemporaneous presence of more than one\nstream of consciousness in the same human being. No mere\nalternations of personality, however striking, nor any change\nhowever great that takes place in the self when it passes\nfrom the waking to the hypnotic state, would suffice to prove\nthe simultaneous existence of more than one consciousness\nin the organism. For these different states could still be\nconceived as being what in most cases they probably are,\nnarrltely, successive states of the same consciousness.\nThis explanation cannot however be used to account for\nso-called automatic actions requiring the exercise of a reason\ning faculty for their performance, yet working themselves\nout without the knowledge of the waking self while the latter\nis otherwise engaged : still less can it account for certain\nextreme cases of disintegrated personality in which two\ndistinct and fully developed selves appear on the stage at\nthe same time. Take for instance the extraordinary case\nof Miss Beauchamp, under observation for many years by\n\f390 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART\nDr. Prince of Boston, in which two of the personalities\nengage in an open conflict of wills, one of them deliberately\nand repeatedly produces hallucination in the other, and is able\nto play the part of a sane spectator looking on at the other's\ndelirious dreamings.\nIt is true that most of these cases could be explained\nby supposing a duality, not a multiplicity of conscious\nactivities in the single organism : but the principle once\nadmitted, there are many phenomena in abnormal and even\nin normal psychology which are most easily accounted for\nassuming an almost indefinite possibility of dissociation\namong the elements that go to form the normal personality\n\u2014different groups of ideas and memories \" splitting off \" as\nit were from the main current of consciousness and setting\nup a certain independent existence of their own.\nHow then, on this hypothesis, are we to conceive the\nrelations of the central individuality to the body as a whole\nand to the various subordinate activities of consciousness\nassociated with it, in such a way as to do justice at once\nto the unitary character of the soul and the complexity of\nthe factors which constitute the personality as we know it?\nThis is the problem which Myers attacks in earlier\nchapters of his great work. Of the masterly manner in which\nfrom many points of view he has performed the task I need\nnot speak.\nNo unprejudiced person can fail to recognize the marvellous\ncombination of qualities which the writer has brought to his\nwork\u2014the boldness, the industry, the eloquence, the rare\nfelicity of style and fecundity of literary illustration, the\npower of co-ordination in dealing with masses of detail, the\nimaginative insight, the burning enthusiasm, the unconquer\nable faith in the ultimate triumph of the spiritual element.\nOn the other hand I must in all humility confess that I\nhave never yet succeeded in forming a clear idea of what Myers\nmeans by the subliminal self, or in what relation he conceives\nit to stand with the supraliminal self on the one side, and\non the other with the indwelling soul, or truly spiritual part\nof us, which he identifies with the unknown real self and\nbelieves to survive the dissolution of its earthly tabernacle.\nAccording to Myers' view there exist in all of us \" sub-\n\fLII.] Presidential Address. 391\nmerged thoughts and emotions which possess the character\nistics which we associate with conscious life \" ; and as, in\naddition to these isolated subliminal processes, \" there is also\na continuous subliminal chain of memory (or more chains\nthan one) involving just that kind of individual and persistent\nrevival of old impressions, and response to new ones, which\nwe commonly call a Self \"\u2014I am quoting his own words -\nhe finds it \" permissible and convenient to speak of subliminal\nselves, or more briefly of a Subliminal Self.\" It is true that\nhe goes on to warn us that he does not by using this term\nassume that there are two correlative and parallel selves\nexisting always within each of us \" but rather means by\nthe subliminal self that part of the self which is commonly\nsubliminal.\" But this qualification seems to mean no more\nthan that the subliminal stream of intelligence, although\nconcurrent, is not habitually organised up to the point of\nranking as a second fully developed self side by side with\nthe supra-liminal current of consciousness which common\nsense regards as our real self. As it seems to be admitted\nthat it can and does become so organised in exceptional cases,\nthe distinction appears to be only one of degree. Anyway the\nvarious \" quasi-independent trains of thought \" are conceived\nas \" co-operating \" together ; messages can pass from the\nsubmerged to the emergent self, and \" suggestions \" can be\nimpressed by the supra-liminal self on the subliminal.\nNow it is just at this point that the question I wish to\npress comes in. It requires two to co-operate, as it requires\ntwo to quarrel. In what sense are we to understand the\nco-operation between distinct streams of consciousness, and\nwhat is the meaning of these \" messages \" and \" suggestions \"\nthat pass between the subliminal and supra-liminal selves?\nFrom the standpoint taken up in this address this question\nadmits I think of an intelligible answer. It is hardly\nconsistent with our presuppositions to assume that there\ncan be thought without a thinker. Psychology as a science\nmay find it convenient to speak of ideas and mnemonic\nchains and states of consciousness as if these could subsist\nin the void. For us however this conception must remain\nan illegitimate abstraction, and we must hold that ideas and\nstates of consciousness are in reality only forms of the\n\f392 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART\nactivity of a psychical entity or mind, even though that mind\nfall far short of the degree of development implied in a self-\nconscious personality.\nIf then every distinct stream of consciousness implies a\ndistinct centre of psychical activity or mind, a plurality of\ndistinct streams of consciousness in man implies a plurality\nof minds associated in the human organism. If interaction\nbetween these minds takes place indirectly it must be through\nthe medium of the physical elements of the organism. If\nit takes place directly there would appear to be the strongest\npresumption in favour of regarding it as telepathic, telepathy\nbeing the only form of direct action between mind and mind\nwhich has any support from experience. It is quite possible\nhowever that it may take place in both ways ; and if a\nconjecture for which we left room some little time ago has\nany foundation in the real order of things\u2014namely that no\nfinite mind is entirely without physical activity, nor any\nmaterial element wholly destitute of psychical attributes\u2014\nthen it is conceivable that the two ways may shade off into\neach other.\nWould Myers have accepted this answer? Singular as it\nmay appear, I am not aware that in any part of his book\nhe has discussed the nature of the interaction between the\nsupraliminal and subliminal selves. Nevertheless the idea\nthat this interaction may in part at least be telepathic in its\ncharacter seemed to me so natural that I could not help\nfeeling some surprise that it should not have occurred to an\nintellect so fertile and ingenious. And in fact, after con\nsiderable searching I have come across one passage in which\na hint of such a possibility is given. The passage occurs\nin the first chapter of the second volume, and consists\npractically of a couple of sentences.\n\"Wherever there is hallucination,\" writes Myers, \"whether\ndelusive or veridical, I hold that a message of some\nsort is forcing its way upwards from one stratum of person\nality to another,\u2014a message which may be merely dreamlike\nand incoherent, or which may symbolize a fact otherwise\nunreachable by the percipient personality. And the mechan-\nseems much the same whether the message's path be\nwithin one individual, or pass between two;\n\fLJI.] Presidential Address. 393\nwhether A's own submerged self be signalling to his emergent\nself, or B be telepathically stimulating the hidden fountains\nof perception in A.\" Here is a distinct hint of telepathic\naction between the two selves within one individual. But\nthe hint is not further followed up, and what is stranger\nstill, it seems to be confined to the case of hallucinations\nproduced in the supraliminal self by the action of the sub\nliminal, and not to extend, or be meant to extend, to\n\" suggestion \" proceeding from the upper to the lower stratum.\nIt is perhaps worth noting that Myers often seems inclined\nto regard telepathy as the peculiar prerogative of the subliminal\nself. This is of course quite inconsistent with the idea of\ntelepathic action within the organism. It has always appeared\nto me a curious paradox which the evidence before us fails\nto support, and I believe nothing will be lost by its definite\nand explicit rejection.\nOn the view which I have tentatively outlined, it is\npossible, I think, to frame a more definite conception of the\ndifferent factors that unite to form the individual human\nbeing, and of the relations between them, than I, at all\nevents, have been able to derive from Myers' account of the\nsupraliminal and subliminal selves.\nEvery psychical centre associated with the organism would,\nin accordance with this view, have to be regarded as \" sub\nliminal \" to every other, though indeed it might be better\nto drop that term altogether in describing the relation as\nI conceive it. The Self of which we are each of us\nconscious is neither the organism as a whole nor any\ngrouping of psychical centres within the organism. It is\na single mind or soul whose conscious states at any given\nmoment are the expression of its reaction against its entire\nenvironment. What is its environment? In the larger\nsense (and this must not be forgotten in considering the\nquestion of survival after the dissolution of the organism),\nits environment is nothing less than the whole universe other\nthan itself. In the narrower sense its environment is the\nphysical organism and every psychical centre associated\ntherewith.

Gerald W. Balfour. [PART\nhas thus inevitably brought us in sight of the idea first put\nforward by Leibnitz, that the living creature is a kind of\nhierarchy of monads arranged in orderly and systematic\nrelations with each other, each reflecting in its own way the\nstates of consciousness of all the rest. Only whereas\nLeibnitz denied all real interaction between the monads and\nsought to account for the apparent interaction by his famous\ndoctrine of Pre-established Harmony, we have assumed\nthroughout that the interaction is real, and conjectured that\nin part at least it might be of essentially the same character\nas that which, as between distinct living organisms, we call\ntelepathic.\nWhat, then, on the psychical side, would be the purpose\nserved by the organism? It seems not unreasonable to\nregard it as an important, perhaps even a necessary, factor\nin the establishment, within a particular group of psychical\ncentres, of a special telepathic rapport. In a normal state\nof the organism the rapport would be such as to result\nin the harmonious co-operation of all the centres under\nthe guidance and control of the one dominant centre\nwhich constitutes the real self of each of us. The healthy\nhuman being would thus resemble a well-ordered community\nin which each subordinate member, in silent understanding\nwith his fellow subjects and with the head of the state, duly\ncarries out the appropriate task imposed on him either by\nthe behests of the latter or by the laws on which the well-\nbeing of the community itself depends.\nAbnormal conditions would imply a disturbance of the\ntelepathic rapport, which in extreme cases may apparently\ngo so far as to alter the whole character and interrupt the\ncontinuity of memory of the dominant self, or even depose\nit from its headship of the community and place a rival self\nin possession.\nComplete and final cessation of the special telepathic\nrapport within the organism I take to be the true significance\nof death.\nWhat is there in all this, you may be inclined to say, but\none more unverifiable hypothesis? Well, perhaps. But in\nthe territory which the Society for Psychical Research has set\nitself to explore, I am afraid we shall often have to content\n\fLii.] Presidential Address. 395\nourselves with hypotheses that can have no other verification\nthan this; that they offer the framework into which, for the\nmoment at least, the accumulated facts of experience, together\nwith those certitudes of which we seem to have immediate\nassurance, can be fitted most easily, and with the least violence\nand stretching, into the semblance of a coherent whole.\nVerification, like so much else, is in the end seen to be a\nquestion of degree : and in this respect no hard and fast\nline can be drawn between the hypotheses of metaphysics\nand those of science. Moreover as regards the particular\nhypothesis now in question, probably the least verifiable part\nof it is that which is already contained, by implication, in\nthe original metaphysical presuppositions from which we\nagreed to start concerning the plurality of real existences.\nIf you refuse me absolution for these, it would be vain to\nhope that you will pardon the temerity of any other specula\ntion in which I may have indulged to-day.\nFor those indeed who are prepared to concede these pre\nsuppositions, and who are also believers in telepathy and\nin the poly-psychic nature of the human organism, the further\nstep of admitting telepathic interaction between the psychical\nelements of the organism ought not to seem a long one. It\nmay be difficult and perhaps impossible to prove telepathic\nagency in this case as in many others ; but it is equally\ndifficult or impossible to disprove it. If, nevertheless,\nMyers appears to have turned aside from the idea, it is per\nmissible to conjecture that the cause lay deep down in\nmetaphysical preconceptions of his own. For in spite of his\nadmission of distinct selves or centres of consciousness within\nthe organism, there always seems to float before him the\nconception of a Soul which should be the real unity of all\nthe rest in a higher sense than that of merely including them\nideally while really excluding them after the fashion of the\nLeibnitzian monad.\nI will not attempt to criticise this conception\u2014which per\nhaps after all I have wrongly ascribed to him\u2014further than\nto say that I find it hard to reconcile with the attribution\nof real existence to the subordinate psychical centres ; and\nthat if it is legitimate to apply it to relations between the\npsychical centres within the organism, it is not easy to see\n\f396 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART\nwhy it should not be equally applicable to psychical existences\ngenerally. I cannot help suspecting that the logical tendency\nof this line of thought if followed out to the end would prove\nto be in the direction of pantheism rather than of that\npersonal immortality for which Myers himself so strongly\ncraved.\nThis however is a subject which I must not pursue further.\nIndeed I have already trespassed too long upon your patience,\nand must now bring this address to a close. In the course\nof it I have ventured to suggest three propositions for your\nconsideration. First, that direct telepathic action between\nmind and mind is a phenomenon which we might reasonably\nhave anticipated on grounds independent of experience.\nSecondly, that the comparative rarity of observed cases is\nno proof that the action is not universal and continuous, as\nthe same grounds would lead us to expect. Thirdly, that\nthe human organism is poly-psychic, and that telepathy\nprobably plays an important part in the relations between\nthe controlling self or soul, and the other psychical centres\nassociated with it.\nI put forward these suggestions in no dogmatic spirit, but\ntentatively ; yet with some hope that they may not be deemed\nwholly without interest or value. In the dark and mysterious\nregion with which the researches of our Society are concerned,\nwe must expect to grope our way in many directions before\nthe right one is found. In such circumstances it is possible\nto be too chary in framing hypotheses as well as too rash,\nalways provided we are resolved that they shall be our\nservants and not our masters. Even a faulty hypothesis is\nnot necessarily worthless ; for experience shows that it is\never out of the fragments of discarded hypotheses that the\nroadway to truth is ultimately built.\n\fLII.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 397\nSUPPLEMENT.\nL\nMR. PETROVO-SOLOVOVO ON SPIRITISM.\nBY WALTER LEAF, Litt.D.\nOUR Hon. Secretary for Russia, Mr. M. Petrovo-Solovovo, of St.\nPetersburg, published last year a translation into Russian of Mr\nPodmore's Modern Spiritualism; and he has now added to this\nwork a valuable \" appendix.\" In so describing it, however, Mr.\nSolovovo is too modest. The \" appendix \" is a solid and original\npiece of original work, of no less than 237 large and closely\nprinted pages\u2014in fact, an independent book, separately published,\nand clearly demanding to be treated as such. I propose to give\nrather a precis than a review of the work, allowing Mr. Solovovo\nas far as possible to speak for himself, especially in the purely\ncritical part ; for criticism of criticism of criticism is not as a rule\nprofitable or entertaining. I will therefore only state that I consider\nMr. Solovovo's judgments always temperate and acute, well worthy\nthe attention of all enquirers, but I must not be taken as always\nagreeing with them.\nThe work consists of two parts\u2014firstly, a criticism of Mr.\nPodmore's methods (81 pages) ; secondly, a historical sketch in six\nchapters of the spiritist movement in Russia (153 pages). I propose\nto deal chiefly with the former, as of more immediate interest to\nEnglish readers.\nMr. Solovovo in his brief preface points out a decided change in\nhis views on many points since he published in 1900 his Scientific\nInvestigation of Physical Phenomena with Mediums^\u2014a change in the\ndirection of scepticism, so that the present work must be taken\nas a corrective of the former. His position lies midway between\nthe spiritists and the sceptics, and he expects to incur the dis\npleasure of both.\n1See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XV., pp. 416-422.\n\f398 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART\nHe agrees with Mr. Podmore, generally speaking, in the following\nviews : (1) the worthlessness of the large majority of reports of\n\" physical phenomena \" as evidence for a new force ; (2) the unsatis\nfactory conditions under which observations have generally to be made,\nwith special reference to the difficulties of uninterrupted attention ;\n(3) the generally low level of spiritists as scientific observers\u2014their\nneglect of obvious means of fraud, their credulous confidence in\nmediums, etc. ; (4) the somewhat suspicious character of the\n\" Rochester \" phenomena, which started the modern spiritist move\nment\u2014though it must not be forgotten that many similar phenomena\nhad been recorded long before 1848, apparently with the exception\nof automatic writing.\nMr. Podmore also shows that the reality of the phenomena in\nquestion involves the existence not of one but of several new forces\ncapable of acting on matter, whereby the probability of deception as\nthe sole and sufficient cause of the phenomena is enormously increased ;\nthough the a priori improbability does not relate to the existence\nof several forces as much as to their union in a special class of\npersons. It is curious that Mr. Podmore does not mention one argu\nment which would seem to support his position, namely, the diversity\nof the conditions demanded for the production of the phenomena.\nFor instance most mediums require darkness. Home, on the other\nhand, rarely if ever sat in complete darkness, and often in a very\nsatisfactory light. Some mediums (e.g. the Davenports) insist on\nbeing bound, others (e.g. Eusapia) will not permit it. Darkness is\nnot a universal condition even of \" materialisation.\"\nBut Mr. Podmore's criticism has its weak side, and after this general\nexpression of agreement we must pass to this. For instance, he\nlays down a principle that in the course of years a witness allows\nhis imagination to colour and exaggerate an episode which at first\nhe regards as insignificant, and cites in support of this a supposed\ngrowth in the Wesley correspondence of the vision of a badger,\nreported to have been seen by Mrs. Wesley in 1717 but not related\nat first hand by her till 1726. Does Mr. Podmore mean that Mrs.\nWesley merely accepted as her own in 1726 a phenomenon which\nnever existed at all ? Then what was the foundation of her\nhusband's and daughter's statements in 1717? Questions like this\nMr. Podmore does not seem fully to face; he too often leaves us\nin the dark as to what he thinks to be the real conclusion to be\ndrawn. As a matter of fact lapse of time seems to produce very\ndifferent effects on different personalities. Mr. Solovovo testifies that\n\ftn.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 399\nin his own case the effect is not to exaggerate, but greatly to\ndiminish, the impressiveness of supposed \" wonders \" which he has\nwitnessed; and he considers that this may be as usual as the\ncontrary.\nMr. Podmore seems to be inconsistent also in his treatment of the\n\" supernormal \" phenomena of \" animal magnetism.\" He rejects the\ntheory of a \"fluid\" or \"effluence,\" but cites without criticism\nexperiments by Esdaile and Elliotson, which seem to support the\ntheory. He appears to admit the possibility of clairvoyance at a\ndistance, and through at least one wall ; why then is he so sceptical\nas to clairvoyance when it affects objects at only a short distance,\nin a closed box or behind the clairvoyant's back ? The a priori\nimprobability appears much greater in the former case than the latter,\nand the question is quite independent of another by which Mr.\nPodmore seems to be guided\u2014the question whether the clairvoyant\nreceives money or no. Generally speaking, Mr. Podmore's idea seems\nto be that unpaid subjects may show any supernormal faculties ; may\nsee events passing 30 miles away, and state facts unknown to any\nperson present. But where a professional medium is concerned,\neverything up to about 1880 must be put down to trickery. By\nthe later eighties, all is changed ; in Mrs. Piper, a paid medium,\nMr. Podmore admits all the faculties he denies to her predecessors.\nIt is true that Mrs. Piper is the spoilt child of the S.P.R. ; but\nthis hardly bears upon the point. \" In saying this I have no wish\nto defend any professional medium\u2014it is likely enough that Mr.\nPodmore's scepticism is well founded. But I should like to see more\nlogical consistency.\"\nDealing with raps, Mr. Podmore (Vol. I., p. 187) says, \"if . . .\nwe could find in the whole literature of Spiritualism but one case\nin which, in the presence of competent observers and under con\nditions well ascertained and fully described, the raps were actually\nheard, when there was good cause for believing it impossible for\nany person present to have made them, we should no doubt do well\nto suspend our judgment, at any rate as regards that one case.\"\nBut Mr. Podmore passes by with absolute silence, among other\ncases which cannot be thus ignored, the classic case of the raps\nattested by Crookes with Mrs. Marshall\u2014raps received on a specially\nprepared membrane and producing a movement recorded by a\npointer on smoked paper.\nPassing over various criticisms in detail of Mr. Podmore's way of\ndealing with particular cases of physical phenomena, we may note\n\f400 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART\nMr. Solovovo's opinion that sufficient attention has not been given to\nZollner's experiments, especially to the production of prints and\nmoulds of \" materialized \" hands and feet. Nor does Mr. Podmore,\nwhen dealing with the production of knots in endless bands,\nmention the most remarkable case,\u2014knots made in two straps cut\nout of soft leather, with sealed ends, lying under Zollner's hands,\nwhere he distinctly felt a movement at a particular moment. At\nthe same time it must be admitted that the conditions are not\nsuch as to force us to regard Zollner's experiments as convincing.\nHis firm belief in the \" fourth dimension,\" his complete ignorance\nof conjurors' methods, the proved omissions in his descriptions, and\nfinally the sorry reputation of Slade, must all detract from the\nvalue of his evidence. Mr. Aksakoff, whose own experiments with\nSlade were disenchanting, believed that Zbllner's success was due\nmainly to himself ; that he was either a medium or was gifted with\na \"catalytic\" force which reacted on Slade.\nAfter Davey's experiments, no reliance can be placed on Slade's\nslate-writing; but there are cases where writing was produced with\ntin- process full in view, and these are less easily to be disposed of.\nEmmette Coleman attests one where a slate on which writing was\nbeing produced under the table was gradually brought up by the\nmedium, Mrs. Francis ; the pencil continued to write for some,\nmoments under the eyes of the company. Coleman's testimony is\nimportant, as he is well known for his exposure of various cheating\nmediums. A somewhat similar instance is recorded by \"Harry\nAlis,\" a well known French journalist, in Dr. Gibier's Analyse ties\nChoscs. But, after all, it must be said that Davey's experiments\nhave reduced the evidence for psychography almost to nil.\nMr. Solovovo agrees with Mr. Podmore that it is practically on D. D.\nHome that the \"to be or not to be\" of spiritualism turns. While\ngiving full weight to Mr. Merrifield's unfavourable evidence (Journal\nS.P.R., May, 1903), he holds that there are many phenomena of too\nsimple and definite a nature to be explained by conjuring or malobser-\nvation\u2014phenomena which can be accounted for on normal lines by\nno hypothesis short of hallucination. He specifies the appearance\nof spirit hands, attested by many good witnesses, notably Crookes;\nund lays especial stress on various cases where these hands actually\nmolted away while firmly grasped by the sitters (which circumstance\nMr. Podmore does not mention at all). He remarks that this pheno\nmenon obviously suggests hallucination, and is surprised that Mr.\nPod more does not quote it in his chapter on hallucinations. This\n\fLIi.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 401\nexplanation, however, is not so easy in view of the actual displacement\nof solid objects by the spirit hands. Still less will it account for the\nmaterialisation of an entire human body as described by Lady\nOookes (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. IX., pp. 309-10), and Lord Dunraven\n(D. D. Home, His Life and Mission, p. 291).\nMr. Podmore's attempt to explain the behaviour of small objects\nby the supposition that they were secretly attached to threads under\nHome's control is difficult enough even when applied to the simpler\ncases of objects lying on a sloping table ; it is quite hopeless as an\nexplanation of such complicated movements as are described by\nCrookes in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., pp. 119-121. In the case of\nthe classical experiment with the beam and balance such a deceit is not\ncapable of absolute disproof, but we must remember that the well-\nknown conjuror, \"Professor\" Hoffmann, regarded this experiment as\nparticularly convincing (Jcurnal S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 120). Generally\nspeaking, Mr. Podmore would have been on safer ground had he\nconfined himself to general criticisms such as those of Lehmann in his\nHistory of Superstition and Magic \u2022 as, for instance, that Crookes's earlier\nreports are too meagre in their descriptions of surroundings ; that he\n\" evidently did not in 1871 suspect the importance of many details\nwhich he omits to mention . and that in some cases he appears to\nhave been misled by the personal influence of \" Katie King.\"\nMr. Podmore has still to leave such phenomena as levitation to his\nchapter on Hallucinations ; though he seems to explain them rather\nas illusions\u2014mistaken interpretations upon a basis of fact. This\nis a decided advance on the older theory of an \"electro-biological\"\ninfluence exerted by the medium by which any hallucination could\nbe imposed upon his circle ; a theory which cut at the root of all\ninvestigation not confirmed by photographic or similar automatic\nevidence. But Mr. Podmore often leaves us in doubt as to his views\nin particular cases. In one famous case Lord Adair, Lord Lindsay,\nand Captain Wynne attested (1) that Home was in a certain room ;\n(2) that he left it; (3) that he returned to it floating through the\nwindow. Does Mr. Podmore think that Home never left the room,\nbut imposed a collective hallucination coverfng the whole phenomenon ?\nOr that he left and returned by the door, and that the flight\nthrough the window was a collective illusion ? Or has he some\nalternative explanation) Any such supposition is difficult, and\nMr. Podmore should not leave us in such doubt. Passing to the\n\"fire ordeal,\" Mr. Solovovo proceeds to quote numerous cases from\nMrs. Home's D. D. Home, His Life and Mission, and The Gift of\n\f402 Walter Leaf, LiM.D. [PART\nD. D. Home, where it was not Home himself but his sitters who\nremained unaffected by the action of the fire \u2014 which cases Mr.\nPodmore apparently makes no mention of.\nMr. Solovovo, after objecting in various points of secondary import\nance to Mr. Podmore's criticism of the Stainton Moses phenomena,\npasses on to Mrs. Piper. Here any difference of opinion with Mr.\nPodmore ceases, and Mr. Solovovo gives his own criticism. He regrets\nthat all observers have not shown the same reserve as Mr. Podmore.\nHyslop's \" monumental \" report on his sittings is of little value ; the\nauthor's colossal industry is coupled with an equally colossal simplicity\nand unconscious preconception. Some of the devices by which he in\nterprets \"communications\" so as to make them veridical are beyond\ncriticism ; one can only hold up one's hands in amazement. The\nstrange thing is that Hodgson himself seems to have been so com\npletely hypnotized by Mrs. Piper that he utters no protest against\nHyslop's methods.\nFollowing Mrs. Sidgwick (Proceulings S.P.R., Vol. XV., pp. 16-38),\nMr. Solovovo lays stress on the many egregious blunders in the\ncommunications as strong evidence against the spiritistic theory.\nSurnames and dates are consistently avoided. Yet these are what\n\"spirits\" should give to prove their identity, not trivial matters, such\nas that Prof. Hyslop's father used to read the paper sitting in his\narmchair before the fire, or that he carried a penknife with a yellow\nhandle in his waistcoat pocket, or that he wrote with a goose quill, or\nwore a skull cap\u2014all mixed up with similar details which did not\ncorrespond with reality.\nEven some of the most remarkable cases of Mrs. Piper's correct\nness are such as naturally lead us to nothing beyond mere co\nincidence. Take, for instance, Prof. Lodge's evidence about \" Uncle\nJerry.\" Some of the statements made by Uncle Jerry were (1)\nthat when a boy he and some others fell into the river; (2) that\none of his brothers killed a cat; (3) that he had a gun and once\ngot wet through while shooting ; (4) that he had a walking stick ;\n(5) that he fought and beat a boy named Rodney, and that the\nboy's father threatened to thrash him. In confirmation it appeared\nthat a third brother killed a cat (the details given were not con\nfirmed) ; that Uncle Jerry had a stick, but the description was\nwrong; that he once fought a boy (\"What an exceptional fact!\"\nMr. Solovovo says), but the boy's name was not ascertained ; and that\nhe actually fell into the river. Surely such incidents are too\nfrequent in early life to allow us to attach any weight to them.\n\fMr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 403\nWe notice that we are rarely told if the medium held the sitter's\nhand. Of course there is much which cannot be explained by\n\u2022\"thought reading\" \u00abi la Bishop; but valuable indications may have\nbeen obtained in this way, for instance, when the medium had to\n\u2022choose between affirmation and negation. It is particularly curious\nthat Hodgson's reports, usually so exact, are in this respect\n\u2022deficient.\nAnother fundamental difficulty is that too much reliance has to\nbe placed on Mrs. Piper's honesty. While fully admitting that she\n\u2022could not have carried out systematic enquiries as to her sitters,\nAnd that the care taken in most cases to preserve their incognito\nat a first sitting was conclusive for that sitting, we cannot but feel\nthat as soon as the identity of the sitter came out, as it did, for\ninstance, in Hyslop's series at the second sitting, there was such an\nopening for collection of information as must compel us to take the\nmedium's honesty into consideration. For instance, her announcement\non May 4, 1895, of \"John Hart's\" death in Naples two days before\nis valueless, unless we rely on her good faith as assurance that she\nhad not read of it on the 3rd, as she might have done, in the\nBoston papers (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 353-7). On the\n\u2022other hand, there are many incidents, notably in the \"G.P.\" series,\nwhich cannot be explained as deception\u2014unless at least we assume\n\u2022collusion on the part of others ; but these have to be set off\nAgainst others where under completely similar conditions similar\nassertions (e.g. as to what was being done at the time by persons\nAt a distance) were wholly incorrect.\nWhat, we must ask,1 would be the position of the S.P.R., or of\nite leading members, if Mrs. Piper should ever be convicted of\nfraud, such, for instance, as obtaining previous information regarding\na sitter, and producing it as a spirit communication ? The rule of\nthe Society has always been in such a case to reject the whole\nevidence of the fraudulent medium without exception. While such\na possibility exists, even in theory, the entire fabric of these\ntrance communications must be regarded as hanging on a thread.\nIf we follow Mr. Podmore in supposing none the less that Mrs.\nPiper sometimes displays supernormal powers in trance, we do so\nfirimarily on two grounds. The first of these is the character and\nknown ability of the investigators who have been convinced by\nher\u2014some of them having shown conspicuous ability in detecting\n1 In thia and the three following paragraphs it will be understood that Mr.\nSolovovo is speaking in his own words, somewhat abbreviated.\n2D\n\f404 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART\nfraud. And secondly, we must give due weight to the repeated\nassurances found in the records, that the evidence most convincing\nto the sitters was too personal for publication. It is regrettable,\nand it might be thought unjustifiable, that so much evidence of this\nsort should have been suppressed by sitters favoured with it, but\nit must be added that a strong impression is produced by such\nepisodes as that between \"G.P.\" and Mr. Howard, related by\nHodgson in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 321-2.\nOur conclusion is that in the mass of data with regard to Mrs.\nPiper, some must be referred to a \" supernormal \" power ; but that\nthese are drowned in an ocean of insignificant and often silly\nrubbish; and that the importance of her trance utterances and\nwritings is enormously exaggerated by her ardent followers. Then\nthere is still another objection. In the case of Adele Maginot\nMr. Podmore shows convincingly that her errors in messages pur\nporting to come from the living prevent us from believing that any\nreliance can be placed on those purporting to come from the dead ;\nwe need only a single hypothesis to explain all. But in the pre\ncisely analogous case of Mrs. Piper we are called upon to assume\nseveral inconsistent hypotheses. At one time she must speak or\nwrite under the influence of the \"departed\"; at another time her\nutterances will represent the thoughts of her sitter; in the vast\nmajority of cases we have to deal only with the products of\nher own brain, working under abnormal conditions. What chaos !\nWhat complication of the problem is introduced by this supposed\nmultiplicity of causes !\nYet such is our conviction of the hopelessness of a priori con\nsiderations in a region where experiment must have the last word,\nthat we do not attribute any decisive importance in the negative\nsense to this last consideration. We will even say that in the\nliterature of spiritism there are to be found facts undoubtedly\npointing to the activity of independent intelligences. But this can\nonly be proved by incontrovertible evidence ; no approximate proof\ncan convince. Such evidence might be supplied by the communica\ntion after death of the contents of a sealed letter written for the\npurpose during life ; but an attempt by the S.P.R. to obtain this\nhas, it is known, completely failed. One such failure proves\nnothing; but if the experiment should be often repeated and\nnever succeed, it would be difficult to avoid a decision definitely\nunfavourable to the spiritist claim.\n\fLII.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 405\nWith the latter part of Mr. Solovovo's book, \"Sketches from the\nHistory of Spiritism in Russia,\" I must deal very briefly.\nThe first chapter deals with a controversy carried on in the\nmonthly reviews of St. Petersburg and Moscow in 1875 and 1876.\nIt was opened by Professor Wagner, who had been induced by his\nfriend Professor Butleroff, already a spiritualist, to attend some\nseances with D. D. Home, whose physical phenomena completely\nconvinced him. Then he followed up with equally convincing\nmaterialisation stances with Bre\"dif, a French medium, and published\nhis results in the Vyestnik Evropy (Messenger of Europe). The\narticle, in virtue of its author's reputation, produced a sensation,\nand called forth replies in other reviews from persons of more or\nless authority. Professor Wagner replied with a preliminary account\nof American spiritualism\u2014Katie King, the Eddys, Olcott, etc.\u2014and\na development of his general theory. Professor Butleroff, an\neminent chemist, joined in the fray, and gave an account of the\nexperiments, extending over some years, which had made him a\nspiritualist. The most important of these were carried on in the\nfamily of his relative, Mr. A. K. Aksakoff, whose wife acted as\nmedium. The whole story was a remarkable one, as coming from\na man of such scientific eminence. With an equally elaborate and\nunfinished reply from Prof. Shklyarevski the controversy dropped.\nThe arguments brought forward by the disputants need not\nconcern us; but the interest aroused led to the appointment by the\nPhysical Society of the St. Petersburg University, on the proposition\nof no less a person than Prof. Mendelyeff, of a Committee to enquire\ninto the asserted facts, and report which of the phenomena were to\nbe referred to known natural laws, which to hallucination, which\nto fraud ; and whether there were any which involved unrecognized\nlaws of nature. Mendel^eff himself was a member. The Committee\nput themselves in communication with Messrs. Butleroff, Wagner\nand Aksakoff, the latter of whom came to England to find mediums\u2014\nnone were obtainable in Russia. He brought the brothers Petty\nfrom Newcastle, but no success was obtained in a series of sittings\nat the end of 1875, and they made an unfavourable impression.\nAt sittings with Mrs. Marshall (\" Clayer \") in January 1876 raps\nwere obtained and the table was lifted from the floor; but the\nCommittee had grounds for suspecting fraud, and demanded tests\nwhich were refused. Ultimately Messrs. Aksakoff, Wagner and\nButleroff withdrew from co-operation, and the Committee decided\nto close the enquiry, publishing in March 1876 a report entirely\n\f406 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART\nunfavourable to the claims of spiritism. Mendele\"eff followed this\nup with a bulky volume, attacking spiritists in general and Aksakoff\nin particular. Aksakoff retorted in another book, and we are not\nsurprised to hear from Mr. Solovovo that the controversy became\nmainly personal, the real issues being lost in a cloud of recrimina\ntion. Doubtless the scientific men were prejudiced and hasty in\ntheir generalisations from too few experiments, the spiritists were\nimpatient of the necessary tests. That is the usual course of things.\nMr. Solovovo's next chapter contains a full sketch of Mr. AksakofTs\nlife, which, as members of the S.P.R. know, was ungrudgingly given\nto spiritist enquiry. We may the less reluctantly pass over this\nas an obituary notice of Mr. Aksakoff from the same pen appeared\nin our Journal, Vol. XI.\nThe accounts of Professor Butleroff and Professor Wagner, and of\ntheir work on psychical phenomena after 1876 are both well done,\nbut too long for reproduction here. It should be mentioned that some\nextracts given by Mr. Solovovo from Prof. Wagner's account of his\nexperiments do certainly show that these experiments might have\nbeen carried out in a more scientific temper\u2014to put it very mildly.\nThere follows an account of the Russian Society for Experimental\nPsychology, founded in 1891, with Prof. Wagner as president. It\nis interesting to hear that \"the Society was from the first confined\nwithin very narrow limits by the Medical Council of the Ministry\nfor Home Affairs.\" The Medical Council narrowed the original\nconstitution of the Society, \"closing the meetings to the public, and\nin a special minute extending this prohibition even to subjects for\nexperiment.\" The Society began with an enquiry into a case of\nclairvoyance brought before them by Dr. Khovrin of Tamboff, who\nstated that one of his hospital patients had shewn power of reading\nclosed letters. The Society sent a letter, drawn by lot from nine,\nwritten by different members, so that no one knew the contents.\nThe letter was placed in an envelope, secured against opening by\ningenious test provisions. The medium ultimately gave the exact\ncontents of the letter, but the conditions were not absolutely con\nvincing, and the Society only decided that clairvoyance was\nextremely probable, and that further tests were very desirable.\nThese, however, could not for various reasons be carried out.\nlu 1893 a series of stances were held with a medium named\nNikolaeff. The minutes of the sitting of April 27 tell a story\nwhich, as Mr. Solovovo justly says, can hardly be paralleled even\nby Home's manifestations. The medium was first entirely stripped,\n\fLII.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 407\nand dressed in a garment provided by the observers, which con\ntained nothing white of any kind. He was put into a chair in a\nside room behind a portiere (both rooms being first thoroughly\nsearched) in front of which the observers sat, armed with opera\nglasses for better vision. The room was lighted by an electric\nlamp under a shade ; the medium could be well seen, his features\nand the position of his fingers being visible as soon as the portiere\nwas drawn back. Under these circumstances luminous clouds were\nseen beside him, gradually becoming more definite, to an accom\npaniment of noisy blows on furniture in all parts of the room.\nAs the blows became weaker the luminosity formed itself into a\nhand which moved in various directions, passing behind his chair\nto the wall, on which it made a loud and rapid knocking. The\nsounds of another invisible hand were heard at the same time\nin another part of the room. Presently another luminous hand\nappeared in the air by the hanging lamp.\nThe medium now asked for a few minutes' interval. When the\ncurtain was again withdrawn, a luminous hand was again seen\nclose to the lamp, striking hard blows upon the glass shade. It\nsuddenly pulled off the silk fringe, and threw it through the\nopening in the curtain with such force towards Dr. Leshchinsky\nthat he involuntarily ducked. Soon a second luminous hand'\nappeared to the medium's left. Both appeared to proceed from the\nmedium's sides, being separated from his body by a small dark\nspace, his own hands being also visible. They moved to his head\nand his toes, before him and behind, rapping on his chair and the\nsofa. The blows on the sofa were heard three rooms off. At\ntimes the hands extended further, and rapped on the floor, the\nwalls, the ceiling, and sideboard. Subsequently the right luminous\nhand reached to a heavy settee and pushed it towards the spec\ntators with a force and speed hardly attainable by an ordinary\nman. At the same time the left hand went to the medium's chair\nand moved it forward with the sleeping medium on it. After some\ndeafening clappings of the hands in the air, the stance closed.\nThe minutes are signed by six doctors, Fischer,1 Stepanoff,\n1 Mr. Solovovo informs ua that of these six persons Dr. Elis^eff and Dr.\nKraevsky are now dead and that Messrs. Stepanoff and Leshchinsky failed\nto answer letters of inquiry he sent them, Dr. Korchagin's address being\nunknown to him. On the other hand, Mr. Solovovo interviewed Dr. Fischer\nand obtained from him full confirmation. The account of the stance was, we\nbelieve, drawn up by Dr. Eliseeff.\n\f408 Walter Leaf, Litt.D.

He no\nlonger considers the \"Zollner's knots\" on closed loops of string or\nleather as convincing ; nor does he lay much stress on the materiali\nsation stances, of which he had no personal experience. He is,\nhovVever, inclined to see importance in the repeated cases of \" passage\nof matter through matter,\" exemplified chiefly by the hanging of\nchair backs over the arms of the medium and a spectator\u2014on one\noccasion on the arms of two spectators\u2014while hands were being\nheld.

A curious case is quoted at length where writing and an\n\"apport\" were obtained inside an iron vessel with a carefully riveted\nlid ; but the evidential value of this is discounted by the fact that\nthe vessel was left for some weeks lying in a room to which\nSambor might have had access, and that the experiment failed when\nrepeated under better conditions.

M'DOUGALL, M.Sc., M.B.\nIn his book on The Dissociation of a Personality, Dr. Morton\nPrince gives us a clearly written, detailed account of the\nremarkable case of Miss Beauchamp, of which he has previously\npublished brief and incomplete descriptions.2 The case seems\nto be in many ways the most extraordinary and, from the point\nof view of the 8.P.R., if not also from every point of view,\nthe most important of all the cases of multiple personality that\nhave been carefully studied and described. A summary state\nment of the principal features of the case must precede\nany discussion of it, though nothing short of the reading\nof the whole book can give an adequate impression of its\nvery strange character and of the care and thoroughness with\nwhich it has been studied by Dr. Prince. \" Miss Beauchamp,\nthe subject of this study, is a person in whom several\npersonalities have become developed ; that is to say, she may\nchange her personality from time to time, often from hour\nto hour, and with each change her character becomes trans\nformed and her memories altered. In addition to the real,\noriginal or normal self, the self that was born and which she\nwas intended by nature to be, she may be any one of three\ndifferent persons.

Each varies in these respects from the other two,\nand from the original Miss B. Two of these personalities have\nno knowledge of each other and of the third, excepting such\ninformation as may be obtained by inference or second hand,\nso that in the memory of each of these two there are blanks\nwhich correspond to the times when the others are in the flesh.\nOf a sudden one or other wakes up to find herself, she knows\nnot where, and ignorant of what she has said or done a moment\nbefore. Ouly one of the three has knowledge (i.e. apparently\nimmediate knowledge) of the lives of the others, and this one\npresents such a bizarre character, so far removed from the others\nin individuality, that the transformation from one of the other\npersonalities to herself is one of the most striking and dramatic\nfeatures of the case. The personalities come and go in\nkaleidoscopic succession, many changes often being made in the\ncourse of twenty-four hours.\"\nTo these three abnormal phases or personalities Dr. Prince\ngives the names B i., B in. (or Sally), and B iv. in the order\nof their discovery, B n. being merely B i. in the hypnotic state.\nWhen the patient first came under Dr. Prince's care she\nwas a serious, refined, and reserved college-student showing\nneurasthenic symptoms, due apparently to the influence of a\nseries of moral shocks and of excessive study upon a constitution\ncongenitally somewhat unstable. This was the personality that\nbecame known as B i., and which seems to have been dominant\nfor some years previous to this time, although a history of\noccasional trance-like states of brief duration suggests that during\nthese years B i. may have occasionally been supplanted by B in.\nor iv. or some other abnormal phase. Other remedies having\nfailed, treatment by hypnotic suggestion was undertaken. The\npatient passed easily into a well-marked hypnosis of a not\nunusual kind, in which she was passive, but could converse\nintelligently and knew of her waking life, although on waking\nshe remembered nothing of the hypnotic period. Very soon,\nhowever, traces of what proved to be a very different personality\nappeared. This was Bin. or Sally, by far the most interesting\nmember of this strange group. At times during hypnosis the\npatient spoke of the waking Miss B. as \" she,\" and claimed to\nbe a different person, \"Because 'she' does not know the same\n\f412 W. M'Dougall. [PART\nthings that I do.\" Dr. Prince assures us that, being led to\nsuspect the development of an abnormal personality, he now\nmade every effort to suppress this tendency, but in vain. B m.\ncontinued to alternate with B n. in the hypnotic periods, and\nsoon claimed the name Sally Beauchamp. Although B in.\nseemed to know all about B i. and B n. (e.g. could remember\ntheir conversation), they knew nothing of her, and were kept\nin ignorance of her for some time, and eventually only learnt\n\u2022of her indirectly. \" One of the most interesting features when\nthe change to B in. took place was the sudden alteration of\ncharacter, which was almost dramatic. It was amazing to see\nthe sad, anxious, passive B n. suddenly become transformed\ninto a new personality, stuttering abominably, and exhibiting a\nlively vivacity, boldness, and saucy deviltry, difficult to describe.\nNo longer sad, but gay and reckless, she resented any attempt\nto control her.\" B in. soon began to provide indications that\nshe continued to have a conscious existence while B i. was\ndominant. It has already been said that B in. shewed extensive\nknowledge of B i.'s life and thoughts, and now sometimes Bi.\nexecuted certain actions quite involuntarily, e.g. threw down\nthe book she was reading, much to her own annoyance, and\nB in. claimed to have produced these actions, because Dr.\nPrince had told her that B i. must not read too much. (p. 37.)\n\"It is worth while noting how sharply differentiated were the\nvolitions of the two personalities at this early date. Later, I\npersonally witnessed similar phenomena on numerous occasions.\"\nThis, in fact, was an early stage of a prolonged struggle for\nmastery between the two personalities B i. and B in. \" From\nalmost the very first her (B ni.'s) language implied a concomitant\nexistence for herself, a double mental life for Miss Beauchamp.\nShe always spoke as if she had her own thoughts and perceptions\nand will during the time while Miss Beauchamp was in existence.\"\nB in., i.e. Sally, being questioned as to her knowledge of what\nB i. had read, \" her answer implied co-existence and parallelism\nof thought, for she explained certain lapses of knowledge by\nasserting that ordinarily, as she herself was not fond of books, she\ndid not pay attention while Miss B. was reading; but that when\nshe did so, which was only when interested, she could understand\nand remember the text; that she liked different books from\nB i. liked, and that she understood some things B i. did\nand vice versa.\"\n\u2022, and vtce vet\n\fLII.] The Case of Satty Beauchamp. 413\nIt became apparent also that while B i. had good command of\nthe French language and of shorthand, Sally knew neither.\n(p. 47.) Nevertheless, Sally \" claimed, in her own peculiar\nlanguage, to be always present as a subconsciousness.\" Dr.\nPrince, who rejects as grossly fallacious the doctrine that an\nindependent subconsciousuess is a normal feature of human\npersonality, or that the hypnotic self usually persists as such a\nsubconsciousness during waking life, was very sceptical of the\ntruth of this claim of Sally's, but was soon compelled by over\nwhelmingly strong evidence to admit it. B i. began to be\ntroubled by an increasing variety of uncontrollable involuntary\nimpulses. Among other things she told lies, and talked dis\nrespectful nonsense to her friends, much to her own distress. A\nseries of experiments in crystal-gazing seemed to prove, \" first, the\ndistinctiveness of the two co-existent conscious selves, as far at\nleast as concerns the separateness of the simultaneous perceptions ;\nand second, the greater completeness of the memories of Sally\nfor a certain class of facts.\" (p. 85.)\nAbout two months after Sally's appearance as a phase of\nhypnotic personality and a sub- or co-consciousness, she made a\ngreat step towards a fuller control of the organism. Both B n.\nand Sally in hypnosis had frequently rubbed their eyes, and this\nSally declared was due to her efforts to get her eyes open, a thing\nnot hitherto allowed to either hypnotic phase. At last Sally\nsucceeded in rubbing and opening B i.'s eyes, whereupon \" B i.\ndisappeared and ' Sally ' came, mistress of herself, and, for the\nfirst time, able to see.\" (p. 95.)\nFrom this time on Sally frequently had possession of the whole\norganism for considerable periods, during which B i. seemed to\nbe entirely unconscious, and she began to play all sorts of tricks\nfor the annoyance of B i. when she should have her turn of\nconscious life, among other things writing abusive letters to B i . ,\nand leaving them to be found and read by her on returning to\nconsciousness. In this way B i . learnt of the existence of Sally,\nand concluded she was possessed of devils.\nWhen B i. was fatigued and in poor health Sally dominated\nand excluded her frequently, and the better B i.'s health the\nmore difficult did Sally find it to get the upper hand,\u2014she felt\nherself \"squeezed,\" as she said, and for periods of some months\nof exceptionally good health B i. was free from Sally's interven\ntions. But on the whole Sally gained upon B i., and succeeded\n\f414 W. M'Dougatt. [PART\nin supplanting B i. in the control of the body with increasing\nfrequency. During one period B i. fell into a delirium, and then\nSally alternated with her at short intervals, appearing perfectly\nsane. This was but one instance of the fact that Sally's health\nand spirits were always much better than B i.'s. Sally, in fact,\ndid not know fatigue and lassitude, so frequent with B i.\nThis absence of all fatigue in Sally must be connected with the\nfact that she, i.e. the patient, during the periods of Sally's\ndominance had \" a peculiar form of anaesthesia. With her eyes\nclosed she can feel nothing. The tactile, pain, thermic, and\nmuscular senses are involved. You may stroke, prick, or burn\nany part of her skin, and she does not feel it. You may place a\nlimb in any posture without her being able to recognise the\nposition which has been assumed. But let her open her eyes\nand look at what you are doing, let her join the visual sense\nwith the tactile or other senses, and the lost sensations at once\nreturn. . . . The same is true of auditory perceptions. If Sally\nhears a sound associated with an object, she can feel the object.\"\n\" Sensation may also be restored by suggestion. But the restora\ntion is only temporary, lasting for a few hours or for the day.\"\n\" Sally's anaesthesia extends to the somatic feelings. She is\nnever hungry or thirsty.\" (p. 149.)\nAfter about a year of this sort of life appeared a third\ndistinct personality, B iv., \" who seemed quite as much a real\nperson as did the Miss Beauchamp whom we all knew (i.e.\nB i.).\" B iv. knew nothing of recent events in the patient's\nlife, nothing of B i. and of Sally, and did not recognise\nDr. Prince or other friends of the patient. She seemed a\nnormally intelligent person suddenly set among scenes and\npersons hitherto unknown to her. She soon set herself to find\nout all she could of her environment, concealing her ignorance\nas far as possible with considerable skill. In character and\ntemperament she was quite unlike both B i. and Sally, being less\nreserved than Bi., and far more combative and determined, and\nhaving nothing of Sally's childish and impish delight in fun, in\nbreaches of decorum, and practical jokes. B iv. now alternated\nfrequently with B i. and Sally. Sally's relation to B iv. was\ncuriously different from her relation to B i. Sally was aware not\nonly of all Bi.'s actions, but also apparently of all her thoughts\nand emotions; but as regards B iv., Sally knew only her actions,\nand nothing directly of her conscious states, but like any other\n\fLli.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 415\n\u2022constant spectator, could infer much of B iv.'s mental processes\nfrom her actions and expressions.\nAs B iv. began to realise her strange relations to B i. and to\nSally, she conceived a violent dislike of Sally, which was recipro\ncated, and for B i. she had contemptuous indifference. Unlike\nSally, B iv. shared most of B i.'s accomplishments, e.g. a knowledge\nof the French language. Dr. Prince was soon able to discover\nthat B iv.'s memory was a blank as regards the life of the patient\nduring the six years preceding her appearance, a period initiated\nby a moral shock. Events antecedent to that incident she\nremembered in normal fashion. The amnesia was, however, not\n\u2022quite complete. B iv. had momentary dream-like memories of\nincidents in the life of B i., and by inducing her to fix her mind\nupon these visions and to describe them Dr. Prince was able\nto obtain an account of the episodes that seemed to have been\nthe immediate cause of the patient's strange condition, and to\narrive at the following conclusions : ' ' Putting together all the\nfacts thus far learned which bear upon the development of B i.\nand B iv., we are able to make the following historical summary,\nfor which the evidence is conclusive : Miss Beauchamp was distinct\nas a unity, a single consciousness, up to the summer of 1893.\nAt that time there occurred a psychical catastrophe, which pro\nduced a disintegration of consciousness, by which her personality\n\u2022changed and she developed into B i. B i. retained all the\nmemories of her youth, as well as of the accident which led to\nher development ; and also, of course, of her whole life (that is,\n\u2022exclusive of Sally's entrances) during the six years succeeding\nthe accident of 1893, that is, up to June 7, 1899. She also\nretained a memory of those periodical times when she had been\nin existence since the latter date. She differs from her original\nstate in certain bodily characteristics known as neurasthenia, and\nin certain mental characteristics \u2014instability and suggestibility\u2014\nand, above all, in certain alterations of character. B i. therefore\nremained the sole personality in existence for six years\u2014to June 7,\n1899\u2014when owing to some cause thus far unknown, a hitherto\nunobserved personality was awakened, which in associations of\nmemory reverted to a past period of life, namely, that which\nantedated and ended with the aforesaid catastrophe of 1893.\"\n\" This personality (B iv.) apparently belonged to that earlier\nperiod, and remembered the events of her life up to a certain\nnamely, that just preceding the incident which caused the\n\f416 W. M'Dougatt. [PART\npsychical shock, at which time her memory ceased. From that\neventful moment this new personality had absolutely no memory\nof anything that occurred during the following six years, ending\nJune 7, 1899. Since this last date she knows and remembers\nonly the events that have happened during those interrupted\nperiods when she herself has been in existence. Since her appear\nance she has been constantly alternating with B i. and with\nBm.\" (p. 224.)\nIt is to be noted that in this passage Dr. Prince ignores the\nevidence of Sally's (B ni.'s) existence before she made herself\nknown to him, and writes only of B i. and B iv.\nThe further discovery was shortly made that the appearance\nof B iv. was due to a communication to B i., which strongly\nrevived the memory of the event of six years ago with all its\nagitating emotions. Dr. Prince then set himself to find out\nwhether B iv. could properly be regarded as the original Miss\nB., and for some time was strongly of that opinion, and there\nfore did all he could to suppress Sally and B i., but without\nsuccess, although the situation was explained fully to Biv.,\nand her co-operation invited and willingly given. The next\nimportant step was the discovery that B iv. hypnotised seemed\nin all respects identical with B i. hypnotised ; either one on\nbeing hypnotised remembered all the experiences of both,\nand spoke of both as \"I\" and \"myself.\" This hypnotic\nphase common to B i. and B iv. was henceforth known as B n.\nB n. had no direct knowledge of, or memory of, Sally's experi\nence. An attempt was made to waken up B n., and make her\nretain in the waking state the character and complete memory\n(save for the Sally periods) of B n. The attempt failed\nrepeatedly, for B n. on awaking became B iv. Then began a\ncontest for predominance between B iv. and Sally, B iv. being\ndetermined to suppress Sally, and Sally resisting with all her\nresources. They exchanged quarrelsome notes, and Sally seemed\nto be able partially to control B iv.'s movements, either forcing\n\"automatic\" movement, such as writing, or suppressing her\nvoluntary movements, as when she made her dumb (p. 284) : she\nalso produced certain forms of systematised anaesthesia and of\nhallucination, and seems actually to have hypnotised B iv. by\nwriting her a note suggesting sleep. (p. 320.)\nNext it was found that B i. and B iv. seemed to become one\nin sleep, for both remembered the same dreams; and further.\n\fLH.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 417\nthat Sally seemed to be awake while B i. and B iv. slept, and to\nbe directly aware of their dreams.\nSally was now induced to write her autobiography, and pro\nduced a most interesting document, partly written while she\nherself was in control or possession of the body, partly by way\nof automatic writing while B iv. was in possession.\nRepeated attempts to give permanence to B u., who seemed\nto be a synthesis of B i. and B iv., were frustrated by the active\nopposition of both B iv. and Sally,\u2014by B iv. because she disliked\nand despised the meek character of B i., by Sally because she felt\nthat the success of this operation would mean that she would be\nsuppressed or permanently \" squeezed,\" as she described her state\nwhen incapable of securing control of the body and banishing her\nrivals. -, .. ,.\nFor two yeard the patient continued this strange existence\nwithout any important new development. Then somehow, in a way\nwhich is apparently not understood by Dr. Prince, but is briefly\ndescribed as an ingenious artifice (p. 436), Sally became aware of\nB iv.'s thoughts and feelings much as she had always known\nB i.'s, and now carried on her contest with B iv. at a greater\nadvantage. Being aware of B iv.'s determination to suppress her,\nSally countered her efforts by inducing in B iv. terrifying\nhallucinations, and by a great variety of annoying tricks, going\nso far as to scratch and bruise severely their common body.\n(p. 456.) In this way B iv.'s resolution was broken down by\nSally and her plans frustrated. But Sally herself was now\nsomewhat discouraged and depressed, and in this mood accepted\nB iv.'s proposal of a modus vivendi. Their plan was to set out\non a holiday trip to Europe and to remain there, each agreeing\nto allow the other control of the body for half the time, and to\nsuppress B i. completely. Their plan was discovered and frus\ntrated by Dr. Prince.\nAfter some more months of troubled existence, a restoration\nof the normal Miss B. seems to have been effected by wakening\nB n., the hypnotised state of B i. and B iv. which combined the\nmemories and characteristics of both B i. and B iv. Dr. Prince\nhad often before attempted to bring about this result by wakening\nB n., but always without success, and the ultimate success seems\nto have been due to Sally, for it was not achieved until she had\nconfessed that it was she who had prevented the success of the\nearlier attempts, and had promised not to interfere any longer.\nIt is not made clear that Sally had any new motive for this more\n\f418 W. M'Dougatt. [PART\naccommodating behaviour, and one is left with the impression\nthat she had grown a little tired of her games. Whatever this\nnew attitude of Sally may have been due to, it seems to have\nrendered possible the desired result. B n. on being wakened\nappeared as a normal person, who in character was a fusion of\nB i. and B iv., and consequently superior to both, who remem\nbered the experiences of both B i. and B iv., as also the patient's\nlife of the period previous to the disintegrating shock, and who\nseemed to enjoy much better health than either B i. or B iv.\nThis personality Dr. Prince regards as the real Miss Beauchamp.\nShe has suffered a few relapses into B i., B iv., and Bin., but\nhas remained continuously unchanged for periods as long as six\nmonths. Sally in these periods gives no sign of her existence ;\nto use her own expression, she seems to have gone back whence\nshe came !\nAlthough this brief summary necessarily omits many interesting\nfeatures of this strange case, enough has been said to shew that\nit surpasses all previously recorded cases in many respects. So\nstrange and wildly improbable does the story seem, that any one\nmay well hesitate to accept it, and indeed it would be incredible\nwere it not that in recent years similar, though less extreme,\n\u2022cases have been reported by a number of independent observers,\nwhose care, capacity, and good faith are above suspicion. These\nanalogous cases, taken in conjunction with the author's high\nstanding in his profession and with the internal evidence of his\nstrictly scientific attitude, his caution, patience, sincerity, and\ndeep interest in the case, warrant us in accepting the facts as\n\u2022observed and reported by him. Dr. Prince does not give us in\nthis volume a full discussion of the theoretical interpretation of\nthis case, but promises to do so in a later volume, and since his\n\u2022earlier work on The Nature of Mind and Human Automatism\nshews him to be well qualified for the task, this supplementary\nvolume should be one of great interest. In the meantime I am\nbidden to discuss it, and, summoning all my resolution, proceed\nto make the attempt.\nIn face of this strange case, it is necessary to admit fully our\ncomplete ignorance of the conditions of psychical individuality.\nThe field is completely open to speculation. Hitherto neither\nscience nor philosophy has been able to establish any certain\nconclusions.\nIf for the moment we put aside Sally, the case appears com\n\fThe Case of Sally Beauchamp. 419\nparatively simple, and comparable in almost all important respects\nto several other well-known cases, namely, the cases of Mr. Hanna,\nof Ansel Bourne, of Mary Reynolds, of Leonie B., Felida X.,\nand others. It appears to be a case of disintegration of a person\nality, or psychical individual, into two alternating personalities,\neach of which is conscious and controls the body for a period\nduring which the other seems to have a merely potential existence.\nThis view, that alternating personalities are the products of the\ndisintegration of the normal personality, is very generally accepted.\nSome authors, e.g. Prof. Pierre Janet, are content to state the\nview in terms of psychical process only ; they assume that any\nstate -of consciousness of a normal person is literally a synthesis\nof a great number of elementary psychical elements or entities,\nsensations, images, and feelings, and that in these abnormal states\nthese become synthesised in two (or more) groups or complex\nsystems instead of one. This does not constitute in any sense an\n\u2022explanation of these cases; it is merely a hypothetical descrip\ntion. For any explanatory hypothesis must set out from some\ndefinite view or assumption as to the conditions of unity of the\nconsciousness of the normal individual.\nIn respect to this great problem there are two, and strictly\nspeaking, only two rival views. (1) The one assumes that struc\ntural and functional continuity of the elements of the brain is the\ncondition of the unity of consciousness or of the psychical\nindividuality of normal persons. This is the assumption explicitly\nmade by many modern authors, most clearly and explicitly\nperhaps by Ed. von Hartmann, the philosopher of the Uncon\nscious, and by G. T. Fechner, the father of psycho-physics, and\nimplicitly by many others. All who accept materialism or the\n\u2022epiphenomenalism of Huxley and Tyndall, or the doctrine of\npsycho-physical parallelism, or the dual-aspect theory of mind\nand body, including H. Spencer, Bain, Stout, Paulsen, Miinster-\nberg, Wundt, Ebbinghaus, and the majority of psychologists of\nthe present time,\u2014all, in fact, who adopt one or other form of\nthe monistic view of mind and body are logically committed to\nthis assumption.\n(2) The other doctrine, radically opposed to the former, is dual-\nistic and maintains that whatever view we may take of matter, even\nif we regard it as essentially of the same nature as mind, we must\nassume that each normal human mind or personality results from\nthe functional association of, and interaction between, the body\n2E\n\f420 W. M'Dougatt. [PART\nand a unitary psychic being, the ego or soul, or psyche, and\nthat the latter is the ground of psychical individuality, of the\nunity of normal individual consciousness. This is not merely\na popular view, but has been maintained in recent years by a\nnumber of psychologists of the first rank, e.g. by Lotze, Ward,\nBradley, Stumpf, Kiilpe and James. Unfortunately most of\nthose who adopt this view have been very reticent as to the\nnature and the scope of the functions of the psychic being.\nTwo principal varieties of this view may be distinguished.\nAccording to the one, all that we mean by memory or retention\nof experience and knowledge, is conditioned by the persistence\nin the nervous system of modifications of its structure, induced\nduring each experience that leaves its mark upon the mind.\nOur conscious mental life is then, according to this view, the\nreaction of the psychic being upon the brain processes, according\nto its own nature and faculties ; but the constitution of the nervous\nsystem and sense organs, and the processes excited in them,\ndetermine the character of the content of consciousness, and\nprovide the occasions for the exercise by the psychic being of its\nintrinsic powers, powers of feeling, of judgment, of reasoning, of\nvolition. 'This form of the dualistic doctrine thus separates the\nforms of mental activity from the content of the mind, the systems\nof ideas and beliefs acquired through experience, assigning the\nformer to the psychic being, the latter to the nervous system.\nAccording to the other form of the dualistic doctrine, it 'is the\npsychic being that retains those impressions in virtue of which\neach experience plays its part in determining future experience,\nor, in more popular language, the psychic being is regarded as\ncapable of memory independently of traces left in the nervous\nsystem. This view, then, ascribes both form and content of mental\nprocess to the psychic being, and regards the nervous system as\nmerely an apparatus, through the mediation of which the things of\nthe physical world are enabled to act upon the psychic being, and\nthrough which the psychic being in turn is able to act upon them,\n\u2014as a merely receptive and executive mechanism, in fact.\nThis latter view alone is compatible with any belief in the\ncontinued existence of the personality after the death of the\nbody, using personality to mean the mental individual as\ndeveloped by his intercourse with his physical and social\nenvironment.

The former variety of\nthe dualistic doctrine is therefore compatible only with a belief\nin impersonal immortality.\nLet us for convenience of discussion denote by the letter C\nthis last view of the relation of mind and body, let us denote\nthe other variety of the dualistic view by the letter B, and the\nmonistic view by the letter A, and further, let us call the kind\nof psychic being assumed by the doctrine of B, the \" psyche.\" and\nthat assumed by doctrine (7, the soul ; for the latter alone\ncorresponds to the conception of the soul generally entertained\nand usually implied by the word.\nCases of multiple personality derive their great importance\nfrom the fact that it seems probable they may throw light upon\nthis great problem, and in this respect the case under review is\nsecond to none.\nIt must be admitted that in so far as cases of multiple person\nality are capable of being regarded as resulting from division\nof the normal personality, they lend themselves readily to explana\ntion in terms of the monistic hypothesis, A . We may suppose that\nin such cases the elements of the nervous system, which normally\nconstitute a single functional group, have become divided into two\nor more such groups, and that the functioning of each group is\nthen accompanied by its own stream of consciousness, a synthesis\nof the elementary psychical processes accompanying the elementary\nnervous processes of that group. This is the explanation of\nthese cases most generally accepted. There are cases which seem\nclearly to involve this kind of functional splitting of the nervous\nsystem and a corresponding splitting of the conscious personality.\nThese are the cases of hysterical anaesthesia so well studied by\nJanet. There seems good reason to suppose that in these cases\ncertain sensori-motor areas of the brain (e.g. the area with which\nan anaesthetic limb is directly connected by afferent and efferent\nprojection fibres), together with more or less of the regions\nof higher function, become functionally dissociated from the rest of\nthe brain, and that the functioning of such a dissociated group\nof nervous elements is accompanied by its independent stream\nof consciousness.\nMany of the anaesthesias and paralyses produced by hypnotic\nsuggestion fall readily into the same class.\n\f422 . W. M'Dougall. [PART\nBut it is, I think, very doubtfully legitimate to extend this\nkind of explanation to all cases of multiple personality and to\nregard them all as of this one type. It is true that we seem\nto be able to set all these cases in a series ranging from the\nsimple types of the kind just mentioned to the most complex, such\nas Miss Beauchamp ; and it is this seeming ease with which they\nmay be thus arranged in a series of progressive complexity that\ngives the extension of this type of explanation to all cases its\nbest claim for acceptance. It is, however, very possible that this\nappearance is deceptive, and that we really have to deal with\ncases of two radically different types, of which the simpler alone\nfall under the above type of explanation, while for the explana\ntion of the others some very different hypothesis must be found.\nStill putting aside Sally, the case of Miss Beauchamp may fairly\nbe claimed as a case of multiple personality resulting from\ndivision of the normal personality, and it is of the relatively\nintelligible type in which the resultant personalities are alter\nnately and never simultaneously conscious. There was a sharply\ncut division of all mental content acquired after a given date\nbetween the alternating personalities B i. and Biv., and yet\nthe mental content acquired before that date was common to\nboth of them. Further, they appear to have become eventually\nrecombined or synthesised, so that the two systems of mental\ncontent, the two memory-continua, were fused to a single one.\nThat B i. and B iv. were the products of a division of the\npersonality of Miss B. we seem justified in believing. But if we\naccept this view we are not thereby logically compelled to accept\ndoctrine A.\nIf we assume B to be the true doctrine, then we must believe\nthat there was a functional splitting of the patient's nervous\nsystem, for the mental content was divided between B i. and\nB iv., and we may suppose either that Miss B.'s \" psyche \" was\nin interaction with the two parts of the nervous system alternately,\nor that a second \" psyche\" entered into functional relations with\none part., while Miss B.'s \" psyche \" maintained its relations\nwith the other part. Of these alternatives the latter seems the\nless improbable. If we are to discuss these strange cases with any\nhope of profit, we must give rein to speculation, and, as was said\n-u-\u2014. there are no established facts that set certain limits to\n\u2022sis. Now if we accept doctrine B, it must be admitted that\nc nothing of the conditions which determine the functional\nI\n\fLII.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 423\nassociation of any \" psyche \" with any nervous system. It may be\nthat, as Mr. H. G. Wells has suggested in one of his weird\nstories, disembodied souls are crowding thickly about us, each\nstriving to occupy some nervous system and so to become restored\nto a full life of sense and motion and human fellowship. Or it\nmay be that with each organism is associated an indefinitely\nlarge number of psychic beings, each capable, on fitting oppor\ntunity, of playing its part as the dominant ' ' psyche \" in\ninteraction with the whole nervous system ; although, in the\ncase of the normally constituted brain, only one such can play\nthis part, while all the rest remain suppressed and latent, or\nplaying subordinate parts in association with subordinate nervous\ncentres. And we may suppose that, as soon as the brain\nbecomes functionally split, a second ' ' psyche \" finds its oppor\ntunity and has its faculties, its capacities for sensation, for\nfeeling, emotion, judgment and volition called into play by the\ninfluence of that part of the nervous system which has fallen out\nof touch with the originally dominant \" psyche.\" It may be,\ne.g., that the personality B iv. resulted from this kind of change,\nthat Miss B.'s original \" psyche\" was for a period of seven years\nthrown out of touch with all those nervous dispositions that\nbecame newly organised under the influence of \"psyche\" Biv.,\nbut was later brought into functional relation with these, with\nthe consequent exclusion of B iv., or its repression to its original\nsubordinate status and restricted activity. The extremely\ndifferent characters of Bi. and of B iv., and the determined\nantagonism of B iv. to B i., the strong opposition of her will\nto every attempt to restore B i. to her normal condition seem to\ncountenance this view.\nOn the other hand, if we regard, as apparently we must, this case\n(Sally excluded) and other cases of multiple personality as cases of\ndivided personality, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to\nreconcile this view with doctrine C', and the conception of a soul in\nthesfull sense of the words as the bearer of both form and content of\nthe mind, as being in itself the full personality independently of\nany nervous system. This task was, of course, attempted by the\nlate F. W. H. Myers in his work on Human Personality, but, as I\nhave argued at length elsewhere,1 his attempt cannot be regarded as\nso successful as to compel our acceptance of his doctrine or to\n1 Mind, October, 1903, vol. xii.\n\f424 W. M'VougaU. [PART\nrender unnecessary the search for a more satisfactory explanation,\nand, as I shall point out below, Myers' doctrine gives us no help\nwhen we attempt to solve the perplexing problem of Sally.\nWhen we turn to consider the personality B in., or Sally,\nour difficulties increase. Dr. Prince in many passages (e.g. p. 18,\np. 234) confidently assumes that Sally also is the product of the\ndivision of the original Miss B., and that the restoration of the\nnormal personality involves the reabsorption or synthesis of Sally\nwith B i. and B iv. No doubt Dr. Prince will seek to justify\nthis view in the promised volume of theoretical discussions, but\nthe confidence with which he puts forward this opinion in the\npresent volume is difficult to understand or to justify. No\nargument is adduced in favour of it, and no single fact recorded\nimplies (so far as I can see) that Sally arose by a splitting-off\nfrom the original personality, or that she became reabsorbed or\nsynthesised with the personalities B i. and B iv. in the process\nof restoration of Miss B. to her original self. The evidence,\nin fact, points all the other way. If we may accept unreservedly\nDr. Prince's description of Sally, then I think we may say with\nconfidence that Sally was not merely a split-off part of Miss B . , and\nthat still less can she be accounted for by the monistic doctrine\nA and the assumption that the nervous system of Miss B. became\ndissociated to form three principal functional systems of elements.\nThat Sally was a personality capable of being fully conscious,\ncapable of ideas, of reasoning, of emotion and of strong volition\nsimultaneously with the conscious existence of B i. seems estab\nlished by Dr. Prince's careful studies, and seems to be fully\naccepted by Dr. Prince himself. Such a consciousness of a\nhidden personality existing contemporaneously with that of\nanother personality which is in control of the bodily organs,\nDr. Prince calls a sub-consciousness, and this is, I think,\nthe most appropriate usage of this term which has been used\nso loosely and with so many different meanings by different\nauthors. Sally claimed, and supported with strong evidence\nthe claim, that she had existed as a sub-consciousness (in\nthis sense of the word) from the earliest years of Miss\nB.'s life; i.e. long before the date of the psychic shock which\nchanged Miss B. into B i. ; and there seems no good reason\nto deny the validity of this claim, although, of course, the\nevidence of Sally's existence as a personality during these early\nyears is less good than that for her continued existence\n\fHi.] The Case of Satty Beauchamp. 425\nas a sub-consciousness in the period of Dr. Prince's observation\nof the case.\nAgain, there is no evidence to shew that when B i. and B iv.\nbecame synthesised to form the apparently normal Miss B. Sally\nwas in any sense or degree included in this synthesis ; the evidence\nrather shews that she was not; the restored personality Miss B.\nseems to have had no memory of Sally's experiences, as she had\nof those of both B i. and B iv. (see pp. 272 and 525), and no direct\nawareness of Sally's existence. Again, Sally cannot be regarded\nas merely a group of ideas and memories dissociated from the\noriginal personality, \" some sort of a dissociated group of\nconscious states,\" if only because of the fullness of her person\nality, the very distinctive and strong traits of character and\nemotional disposition, her developed self-consciousness and strong\nwill, her acute intelligence and comprehensive memory. I would\nrefer the reader to the following passages for statements bearing\non the mental capacities of Sally (p. 238): \"Sally became for\nthe moment serious and earnest, showing great intelligence and\nperspicacity in her analysis of the psychological and other facts.\nShe discussed them with intelligence and interest, went over the\nhistory of the past year, explained many facts which were obscure,\nand recalled others which I had overlooked. Reference to my\nnotebook showed that Sally's memory was correct.\" Notice that\nthese correct memories were not merely evoked by appropriate\nquestioning by Dr. Prince, they were appositely and spontaneously\nbrought forward by Sally in order to bear out the comprehensive\nscheme or ideal construction which she evolved to account for\nthe peculiarities of the case. On pp. 267, 268, again Sally is\nrevealed as keenly reasoning and reflecting upon the case, and\ngiving Dr. Prince valuable suggestions, often in long and care\nfully reasoned letters, such as no child and no person not of more\nthan average intellectual power could produce. On p. 278 Sally's\ndescription of her early life seems to shew her to have had a\nseparate mental life from the time that Miss B. learnt to walk,\nwith very different emotions and some scorn for the personality\ncontrolling the body, to whom she felt herself superior in\nenergy of character. This is further borne out by Sally's auto\nbiography (chap. xxiii.), a very remarkable account of childish\nexperifiK-es, revealing an intelligence and memory which would\nbe exceptional in any autobiographical account by an adult of\nthe years of childhood. In fact, as regards fullness and\n\f426 W. M'Dougall. [PART\naccuracy of memory and voluntary and appropriate recollection,\nSally seems to have been superior to any normal individual, for\nher memory comprised not only almost all the waking experiences\nof the original Miss B. and of B i., and of her own periods of\ndominance over the body, but also all B i.'s dream life and\nher own periods of subconscious existence, and, later, B iv.'s\nexperiences also. As regards Sally's volition, many examples of\nher determined and successful opposition to B i., B iv., and to\nDr. Prince might be quoted. (See especially pp. 284 and 285.)\nShe would render B i. or B iv. dumb, or force them while\ndominant to speak, write, or act in ways quite opposed to their\nintentions and wishes, and she seemed at times to be capable of\nshifting the scenes almost at will, causing herself or one or other\nof her rivals to control the body. It must be noted that these\neffects exerted by Sally were by no means due to the working of\nmere blind impulses, but in most cases were apparently truly\nvolitional, the outcome of well-reasoned, self-conscious delibera\ntion in resolute pursuance of a well-conceived purpose. So acute\nwas Sally, and so well informed, so resolute in the pursuit of\nher ends, that for more than two years she was able to defy and\nbring to nought the combined efforts of Dr. Prince, Bi., and\nB iv. to suppress her, and, as was said above, the eventual\nrestoration of Miss B. by the reunion of B i. and B iv. seems\nto have become possible only because Sally, for some unknown\n- reason, ceased to offer active opposition to Dr. Prince's efforts\nto bring about this change. Beside all this evidence of the fullness\nof Sally's mental life and of the independence and completeness of\nher personality, we must put the following facts: (1) That B u.\n(the hypnotic state of the complete Miss B. comprising B i. and\nB iv.), while recognising both B i. and B iv. and herself as\nessentially the same person, repudiated with horror the suggestion\nthat Sally might be identified in any way with herself, (p. 448.)\n(2) That when B i. and B iv. became synthesised to form the\nperson whom Dr. Prince, seemingly with good reason, regards\nas the real, original and complete Miss B., Sally continued to\nexist as a subconsciousness, aware of all Miss B.'s thoughts; and\nthat this restored Miss B. could remember the events of all\nperiods save those in which Sally had controlled the body to\nthe exclusion of the other personalities, (p. 516.) The relation\nof Sally to the personality regarded by Dr. Prince himself as\nthe complete Miss B. is thus different in every respect from the\n\fLII.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 427\nrelation of B i. and B iv. to Miss B. For neither of these was\naware of or could remember Miss B.'s experiences, while she\nremembers theirs. But we are told of Sally that when, after the\nrestoration of Miss B. she \" appeared again as an alternating\npersonality, her language implied a persistent existence as a sub-\nconsciousness like that of her early youth, and as described in the\nautobiography \" (p. 524), i.e. she had become aware of and could\nremember Miss B.'s experiences.\nIn face of all these facts it is, I think, impossible to agree\nwith Dr. Prince in regarding Sally as a group of states of\nconsciousness dissociated or split off from the normal personality.\nDr. Prince's own statements are incompatible with this view,\nand further, they are inconsistent with one another, as when he\ntells us that the synthesis of B i. and B iv. restored the complete\nMiss B., and yet in other passages speaks of the production of\nSally by dissociation, and also of \"the synthesising of B iv.'s\nconsciousness with that of the subconsciousness (Sally) \" without,\nhowever, offering us a particle of evidence that either one of\nthese latter processes ever took place.\nDr. Prince seems, in fact, to have set out with the conviction\nthat every case of multiple personality is to be regarded as\nresulting from dissociation of a normal personality, and to have\nallowed this prejudice to limit the range of his search for\nhypotheses, and to blind him to the unmistakable implications\nof his own descriptions. In short, to assert, as Dr. Prince does,\nthat Sally is a split-off fragment of Miss B. is to maintain that\nthe part may be greater than the whole.\nIf, then, Sally is not merely a fragment of Miss B., the product\nof mental disintegration, she is not to be explained in terms of the\nmonistic doctrine A, for that doctrine can only give account of\nmultiple personalities resulting from disintegration. What, then,\nis she? Can she be explained in terms of either form, B or C, of\nthe dualistic doctrine? We may state the alternatives more fully\nthus : If one of the essential conditions of Sally's conscious life\nis a psychic being or entity distinct from that of the normal\nMiss B., must we ascribe both form and content of her mind\nto this psychic being (doctrine C), or can we suppose that the\ncontent of her mind (her systems of ideas and memories) is\ndetermined by some part of Miss B.'s brain that has become\ndissociated from the rest and entered into functional relations\nwith this second and superfluous psychic being ?\n\f428 W. M'Dougall. [PART\nThe latter alternative seems hardly tenable, for two reasons\nchiefly : (1) We can hardly suppose that there could be in Miss\nB.'s brain sufficient nervous matter to serve as the physical basis\nfor the very full memories of Sally, in addition to those of B i .\nand B iv., for since Sally can remember so much of Miss B.'s\nexperiences as well as B i.'s and her own, the content of her\nmind must be regarded as at least as abundant as that of all\nthe other personalities together; the whole content of the mind\nis as it were duplicated. If, then, the content of Sally's mind\nhas a physical basis in the brain of Miss B., that brain has to\nserve as the physical basis for at least two minds fully furnished\nwith memories of all sorts. This would seem to imply that of\nthe brain of a normal individual but one-half the nervous\nsubstance may be concerned in mental processes, the other half\nlying dormant ; this implication, whether in the form that\none hemisphere alone normally functions or in any other form,\nseems in the last degree improbable. For it is impossible to\nunderstand how this great mass of extremely expensive, but\nsuperfluous, nervous tissue could have been evolved as a normal\nfeature of the human brain. (2) More important perhaps is\nthe consideration of the peculiar relation of Sally to B i. and to\nMiss B. Sally seems to have become aware of all B i.'s and\nMiss B.'s perceptions, ideas, feelings in an immediate fashion.\nBut it was not that these states of consciousness were simply\nduplicated, forming two similar and parallel streams. Sally was\naware of these states of Miss B.'s consciousness as Miss B.'s;\nshe did not regard them as her own, but knew them for Miss\nB.'s ; she did not simply have the same perceptions, ideas, and\nfeelings as Miss B. or B i., but she knew of them in an intimate\nfashion, and had her own thoughts and feelings and volitions in\nregard to them. How was this knowledge acquired by, or con\nveyed to, Sally ? There seems no alternative to the view\nsuggested by our President in his recent address to the Society,\nnamely, that the process is telepathic, i.e. an immediate influencing\nof one mind by another, a telepathic communication between\nSally and B i. or Miss B.\nThere are three ways in which the telepathic communication\nbetween separate persons may be conceived. (1) It may be a\npurely physical interaction, an influence exerted by one brain\nupon another through some physical medium. This is the\nnatural view for those who adopt doctrine A. (2) It may be\n\fLII.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 429\na psycho-physical interaction, an influence directly exerted by\nthe brain of one person upon the psychic being of another. This\nis the view of telepathy which would be naturally taken by those\nwho hold by doctrine B. If direct interaction between \" psyche\"\nand body of each person is the rule, it must be admitted that\nwe know nothing of the conditions of the alliance of any \" psyche \"\nwith any body, and therefore nothing which necessitates the\nassumption commonly made, that this psycho-physical interaction\nis of an exclusive character. Why should not my brain, under\ncertain unknown favourable conditions, act upon your \" psyche,''\nor any other, as well as upon my own ? (3) The third view,\nadopted by the President in his address, is that the telepathic\ninteraction is purely psychical, an immediate action of one soul\nupon another. This is the view of telepathic action which is most\nnaturally taken by those who hold doctrine C'.\nI submit that the relation of Sally to the other personalities\ncan only be explained by applying the telepathic hypothesis in\nthe third form distinguished above.\nAdopting for the moment doctrine B and the second form of\nthe telepathic hypothesis, we may suppose that the neural\nprocesses of the one brain affect the \" psyche \" of Sally as well as\nthat of Miss B., each responding according to its own nature.\nBut there are insuperable difficulties in the way of any such\nattempt to explain Sally and Miss B. as two psychic beings having\nin common one brain which is the physical basis of the memories\nof both. If this were the case, all memories should be common\nto both Sally and Miss B., but this is not so. Miss B. knows\nnothing of Sally's experiences, and Sally seems to know only\nthose of Miss B. in which she takes an interest, e.g. she knows\nnothing of Miss B.'s highly specialised learning, such as her com\nmand of the French language. It would seem, in fact, that the\nretained traces of Sally's experience, or her memory in the widest\nsense of the word, is independent of Miss B.'s, and that she\nbecomes aware of Miss B.'s mental processes only through the\nexertion of an attentive and selective activity. We seem driven\ntherefore to accept the third form of the telepathic hypothesis,\nwhich implies immediate interaction between souls in the full\nsense of the word, psychic beings whose constitutions determine\nboth form and content of the mind in so far as content is not\ndetermined by present sensory impressions, but by past experi\nence, souls which are capable of retention independently of the\nphysical basis.\n\f430 W. M'Dougall. [PART\nMy conclusion is, then, that if we accept Dr. Prince's description\nof Sally Beauchamp, we can only account for her by adopting\nthat view of the relation of mind and body which I have called\nin this review the C doctrine,\u2014the view that the normal person\nality consists of body and soul in interaction, the soul being not\ndependent upon the brain or other physical basis for its memory,\nbut having the faculty of retaining and remembering among its\nother faculties. I confess that this conclusion, involving the\nrejection of the physical basis of memory, is inconsistent with a\nvery large mass of evidence which I have hitherto considered as\nalmost, if not quite, proving the dependence of all memory\nand, therefore, of all developed personality on the persistence of\nthe physical basis, of the physical changes produced in the brain\nin the course of each moment of experience.1 This great mass of\nevidence is not to be lightly set aside in view of any one case, but\nif a number of cases of the type of Sally Beauchamp, as described\nby Dr. Prince, were to be described by other equally careful and\ncredible observers, I think the weight of their testimony would\nbe irresistible. This conclusion would give very strong support\nto the spiritistic explanation of such cases as Mrs. Piper, and\nwould go far to justify the belief in the survival of human\npersonality after the death of the body. It is for this reason\nthat Sally Beauchamp seems to me of so great interest to this\nSociety.\nOn summing up my discussion of this case, I am compelled\nto admit the unsatisfactory character of my conclusions, for I\nhave argued that the disintegration of Miss B. into B i. and\nB iv., and especially the restoration of Miss B. by the synthesis\nof B i. and B iv. is incompatible with the dualistic doctrine in\nthe second form C, which assumes the soul in the full sense of\nthe word ; but on the other hand, I have argued that this\ndoctrine alone is adequate to account for Sally. It is, of course,\nimpossible to accept both these opposed doctrines, and one has\nto recognise three possible flaws in the argument. (1) The\npremises may be false, i.e. the facts of the case may have been\nincorrectly reported. (2) The argument may have been illogically\nconducted. (3) The conceptions used may have been hopelessly\ninadequate to the realities. The third possibility, as in the case\n1 1 believe that the great weight of this evidence is not appreciated by many\nmembers of this Society. It was almost completely ignored by the author\nof Human Permnalily.\n\fMI.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp.\nof most philosophical argument, probably represents the actual\nstate of affairs. Recognising this probability, one is bound to\nlook round for any other conception that has been formulated to\ndeal with facts of this order, and Myers' conception of the\nsubliminal self naturally claims consideration.\nI will conclude, then, by asking\u2014-Does Myers' doctrine of the\nsubliminal self help us to understand this case ? I cannot see\nthat it does. Myers' doctrine is, of course, a variety of the C\ndoctrine, the doctrine of the soul, not merely in the full sense\nof the word, but in a greatly extended sense.\nI take the essence of this doctrine to be that the soul has a far\nricher store of faculties, memories, and ideas than it is capable of\nmanifesting in the mental processes of normal waking life, and\nthat the restricted character of these manifestations is due to the\nimperfections of the nervous system. How can we apply this\n\u2022conception to explain the manifestation through the one body of\nthe two personalities, Miss B. and Sally, each having her full\n\u2022complement of faculties, memories, and ideas ? If we ascribe this\nduality to the soul, we are assuming two souls, and that we can\ndo equally well without making the additional vast assumptions\nof the doctrine of the \" subliminal self.\" If we ascribe the duality\nto the body, to a functional division of the nervous system, we\nascribe to it an importance and an extent of influence upon the\nmental life which is compatible only with the monistic doctrine A,\nand not at all with a thoroughgoing dualistic doctrine. For one\nwho holds by the conception of the soul in the full sense in which\nit is implied by the doctrine of the subliminal self, to suppose that\nthe soul can simultaneously will in two opposed senses, because\nits instrument, the nervous, is functionally divided, would be as\nreasonable as to expect a man to be able to walk in two opposite\ndirections at one moment, because he has two legs. I venture\nto think that the phrase \"the subliminal self\" may prove detri\nmental to the efficiency of our Society if we do not steruly resist\nthe tendency to use it as a mere cloak for our ignorance whenever\nwe are confronted by the inexplicable events with which we have\nto attempt to grapple. This remarkable case is just of that\nbaffling kind which tempts us to soothe our perplexities, \" to lay\nour intellects to rest on a pillow of obscure ideas,\" by the\nutterance of that seductive phrase the \"subliminal self.\"\n\f432 Frank Podmore. [PART\nIII.\nREVIEWS.\nHenry Sidyunck : a Memoir. By A. S. and E. M. S. (London :\nMacmillan & -Co., Limited. New York : The Macmillan Company.\n1906.)\nThis book is practically an autobiography : that is, it consists of\nexcerpts from diaries and letters, with just sufficient connective\ntissue of narrative to bind the parts together. Following this\nexample, I have selected from the book passages of Sidgwick's own\nwriting to illustrate his attitude towards the problems with which\nPsychical Research is concerned, his connection with the Society,\nand the stage which he finally reached.\nHenry Sidgwick was born on the 31st of May, 1838. He entered\nTrinity College, Cambridge, in October, 1855, in his eighteenth\nyear, and, after a brilliant career as an undergraduate, he was\nelected to a Fellowship and appointed Assistant Tutor four years\nlater, when a little over twenty-one years of age. At Cambridge\nhe remained, as tutor, lecturer or Professor, until his death in 1900.\nBrought up as a member of the Church of England, it was some\nyears before Sidgwick definitely seceded from that faith. But the\ndeepest bent of his nature, as he says himself, was \"towards the\nlife of thought\u2014thought exercised on the central problems of human\nlife,\" and the leisure of the years which followed the taking of\nhis degree was largely devoted to philosophical and theological\nenquiry. He began with a systematic study of the philosophy of\nJ. S. Mill, then at the height of his influence ; but soon found it\nunsatisfying :\n\" The nature of his philosophy\u2014the attitude it took up\ntowards the fundamental questions as to the nature of man\nand his relation to God and the universe\u2014was not such as to\nencourage me to expect from philosophy decisive, positive answers\nto these questions, and I was by no means then disposed to\n\fLIL] Review. 433\nacquiesce iu negative or agnostic answers. In fact I had not in\nany way broken with the orthodox Christianity in which I had\nbeen brought up, though I had become sceptical with regard to\nmany of its conclusions, and generally with regard to its methods\nof proof. Thus for several years the time that I devoted to the\nstudy of the questions of most serious concern was divided in\na fitful and varying way between philosophy and theology, my most\nvital interest seeming to lie sometimes in the one study, sometimes\nin the other.\"\nOf his attitude towards Christianity in these early years he writes\nin a letter to a nephew :\n\" As regards theology, those with whom I sympathised had no\nclose agreement in conclusions, their views varied from pure posi\ntivism to the ' Neochristianity ' of the Essayists and Reviewers :\nand my own opinions were for many years unsettled and widely\nfluctuating. What was fixed and unalterable and accepted by us\nall was the necessity and duty of examining the evidence for his\ntorical Christianity with strict scientific impartiality ; placing our\nselves as far as possible outside traditional sentiments and opinions,\nand endeavouring to weigh the pros and cans on all theological\nquestions as a duly instructed rational being from another planet\n\u2014or let us say from China\u2014would naturally weigh them. . . .\" 1\n(p. 40).\nWith a view to acquiring more insight into the historical origins\nof Christianity Sidgwick devoted his leisure for about three years to-\nthe study of Arabic and Hebrew, and made considerable progress in\nboth languages. Ultimately he abandoned these studies as involving\ntoo much labour in proportion to any help likely to be derived\nfrom them in solving the problems which he had set before him.\nIn 1869 he found himself so far removed from the standpoint of\northodox Christianity that he resolved upon resigning his Fellow\nship. This of course was before the University Tests Act, at a\ntime when the tenure of a Fellowship carried with it the obligation\nof accepting the formularies of the Church. This decisive step was\nthe outcome of a long mental struggle, extending over many years.\nThe resignation was not, however, a protest against Church doctrines\nor an explicit declaration of agnosticism. Writing immediately after\nthe step had been taken to E. W. Benson, he says, \" I do not, as\nat present advised, intend to secede from the Church of England.\"\nHe adds that he had stated the case to Lightfoot, explaining that\nlLife of Archbishop Benson, Vol. I., pp. '249, 250.\n\f43* Frank Pod-more.

The\nresignation was in fact intended as a vindication of his own honesty,\nand a protest against the prevailing laxness, which allowed men to\nregard subscription to the dogmas of the Church as a mere formality.\nHe writes shortly after the resignation to a friend :\n\"Personally, I feel no doubt that I have done right. For long\nI have had no doubt except what arose from the fact that most\nof the persons whose opinion I most regard think differently \"\n(p. 200). . . . \"I feel very strongly the importance of 1 pro\nviding things honest in the sight of all men.' It is surely a great\ngood that one's moral position should be one that simple-minded\npeople can understand. I happen to care very little what men in\ngeneral think of me individually : but I care very much about\nwhat they think of human nature. I dread ' doing anything to\nsupport the plausible suspicion that men in general, even those\nwho profess lofty aspirations, are secretly swayed by material\ninterests.\n\" After all, it is odd to be finding subtle reasons for an act of\nmere honesty : but I am reduced to that by the refusal of my\nfriends to recognise it as such\" (p. 201).\nAnd to another friend at about the same date :\n\" Just now I am much depressed, with no particle of regret for\nwhat I have done, but depressed at the thought of being so different\nfrom my friends.\nWhy should a man desire iit any way\nTo vary from the kindly race of men?\nThere is nothing in me of prophet or apostle. The great vital,\nproductive, joy-giving qualities that I admire in others I cannot\nattain to : I can only lay on the altar of humanity as an offering\nthis miserable bit of legal observance\" (p. 199).\nBut he felt constantly the need of doing some practically useful\nwork in the world, and one characteristic effect of his resignation\nand of the mental struggle which had preceded it was that he gave\na large part of his time and energies for many years after this\ndate to furthering the higher education of women\u2014as a positive\noffering to lay on \" the altar of humanity.\"\nBut whilst Sidgwick was unable for his own part to find an\n\fill.] Review. 435\nassured hope in the acceptance of the Christian faith, he was pro\nfoundly impressed with the importance of such a hope for the world\nat large. Thus he writes in 1881, \"In fact, the reason why I keep\nstrict silence now for many years with regard to theology is that,\nwhile I cannot myself discover adequate rational basis for the\nChristian hope of happy immortality, it seems to me that the\ngeneral loss of such a hope, from the minds of average human\nbeings as now constituted, would be an evil of which I cannot\npretend- to measure the extent. I am not prepared to say that\nthe dissolution of the existing social order would follow, but I\nthink the danger of such dissolution would be seriously increased,\nand that the evil would certainly be very great\" (p. 357). Again, in\n1887 he writes, \" Some fifteen years ago, when I was writing my\nbook on Ethics, I was inclined to hold with Kant that we must\npostulate the continued existence of the soul, in order to effect that\nharmony of Duty with Happiness which seemed to me indispensable\nto rational moral life. At any rate I thought I might provisionally\npostulate it, while setting out on the serious search for empirical\nevidence\" (p. 467).\nBut while he thus remained convinced of the importance, alike\nfor morality and for happiness, of the belief in a future life, as\nyears went on Sidgwick found less and less support for the belief\nin either philosophy or religion. And already, leaving tradition and\nintuition, he had set himself seriously, as indicated in the passage\nlast quoted, to search for empirical evidence of immortality. There\nis a passage in a letter written to F. W. H. Myers in 1872 which\nillustrates his attitude towards the problem :\n\"I sometimes feel with somewhat of a profound hope and enthu\nsiasm that the function of the English mind, with its uncompromising\nmatter-of-fact-ness, will be to put the final question to the Universe\nwith a solid, passionate determination to be answered which must\ncome to something \" (p. 259).\nHere we have the key to Sidgwick's life-long interest in the\nproblems of psychical research. It was in fact a life-long interest ;\nfor whilst an undergraduate he had joined the Ghost Society at\nCambridge which Archbishop Benson had helped to found, and o\nwhich Dr. Westcott (afterwards Bishop of Durham) had acted as\nSecretary. Throughout his correspondence from 1859 onwards there\nare constant references to his interest in ghost stories, and in 1863\nwe find him owning that he is \"pretty well read in Pneumatological\nLiterature.\" His first introduction to a Spiritualistic seance was in\n2F\n\f436 Frank Podmore.\nJuly, I860, when he was in his twenty-second year. A few weeks\nlater he writes to his sister :\n\"I gained nothing from my spirit-rapping but experience in the\nlower forms of human nature : the woman was a complete humbug.\nThis does not in the least shake my (qualified) belief in apirit-\nrapping, as I hold that where there is flame there must also be\nsmoke. She accomplished, however, some very remarkable liftings\nof the table, which I am almost compelled to attribute to a con\ncealed machine, as they must have required more strength than she\nwas possessed of, however great her sleight of hand may have been.\nSome remarkable dents were afterwards discovered under the foot of\nthe table, which tend to confirm this theory \"(p. 55).\nIn 1864 he was greatly interested in some experiments in auto\nmatic writing carried on by his friend Cowell, of which a full\ndescription is given in the article by Myers on \"Automatic Writing\"\nin Proceedings, Vol. III., pp. 25-27. In the course of these experi\nments, raps were also heard by himself and Cowell which always\nremained a puzzle to him. He refers to them in letters to Mr. H.\nG. Dakyns as follows: (March, 1864) \"Spiritualism progresses but\nslowly : I am not quite in the same phase, as I (fancy I) have\nactually heard the raps (produced by C.), so that your 'dreaming\nawake' theory will require a further development. However I have\nno kind of evidence to come before a jury. So keep it still dark\ntill I blaze forth\" (p. 104).\nLater, on April 5th, 1864, he writes again to the same corre\nspondent : \" As to Spiritualism, do not speak yet ; I have not pro\ngressed, but am in painful doubt. Still, I have some personal\nexperience and much testimony, and I find it hard to believe that\nI shall not discover some unknown laws, psychological or other ;\nbut I do not yet wish even to expound, except vivd wee when\ninterrogated. The raps were perceived by the sensoria of myself\nand Cowell, sitting at a small table, certainly not in consequence of\nany physical force exercised by us on the table. You will ticket it\nas a case of the 'ide\"e fixe'\" (p. 106).\nThough pressure of other work prevented a continuous and syste\nmatic investigation into Spiritualism, Sidgwick's interest in the\nsubject persisted. Thus in 1867 he writes: \"I certainly thought I\nshould have got further towards explaining Spiritualism, one way\nor the other; however, it gives life an additional interest having\na problem of such magnitude still to solve\" (p. 171). Again in\n1873 he writes to F. W. H. Myers: \"As for Spirit-Rapping, I am\n\fLII.] Review. 437\nexactly in the same mind towards it as towards Religion. I believe\nthere is something in it : don't know what : have tried hard to\ndiscover, and find that I always paralyse the phenomena ; my taste\nis strongly affected by the obvious humbug mixed with it, which,\nat the same time, my reason does not overestimate. ' John King '\nis an old friend, but as he always came in the dark and talked at\nrandom, our friendship refrigerated. Still I shall be glad to accom\npany you on any favourable opportunity \" (pp. 284-85).\nA few months later, in the spring of 1874, Myers proposed a\nco-operative and more systematic investigation of the subject.\nSidgwick agreed to join, and Mr. A. J. Balfour and Lord Rayleigh\nwere also amongst those who took part in the enquiry. But\nEdmund Gurney, it is interesting to note, could in the first instance\npromise nothing more than his warmest sympathies.1 This more\nsystematic investigation, however, proved in Sidgwick's opinion as\nunfruitful as those which had preceded it ; though Myers took a\nsomewhat more favourable view of the results. At the end of 1875\nwe find Sidgwick writing to Myers :\n\"I confess I do not quite like what you tell me of Mrs. Fay (a\nmedium). Why does she keep changing her ground? ... It\nbecomes less and less possible to narrate her behaviour to me in\nsuch a way as to make it seem unsuspicious to outsiders. So I\nfeel that I must for the present drop both her and Mrs. Jencken\nout of my 'case for Spiritualism,' and am vexed at being thrown\nback in this way.\n\" What induces me\u2014not to abandon but\u2014to restrict my spiritual\nistic investigations is not their disagreeableness (they have never\nbeen other than disagreeable as far as paid mediums are concerned),\nbut their persistent and singular frustration. However, I find my\ninterest in the subject is still too intense to allow me to suspend\noperations just yet, so I mean to have some more seances with\nHerne in December, and will join with you in the negotiations\nwith Newcastle \" (p. 294). \u2022\nIn the following year he went several times to the notorious slate-\nwriting medium, Dr. Slade, and writes : \" as far as my own experience\ngoes, I should unhesitatingly pronounce against him.\"\nThe most important investigations in which Sidgwick took part\ndaring this period are described in Mrs. Sidgwick's paper on \" Results\n1 He did in fact, however, as I learn from Mrs. Sidgwick, join the circle\nalmost from the beginning, his original reluctance having no doubt been over\ncome by F. W. H. Myers.\n\f438 Frank Podmore. [pakt\nof a Personal Investigation into the 'Physical Phenomena' of\nSpiritualism\" in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., pp. 45-74, and his\ngeneral views on the subject may be gathered from his discussion\nwith Mr. Massey which follows that paper in the same volume.\nFor the next four or five years Sidgwick's investigations into\nSpiritualism appear to have been intermitted. The next reference\nto the subject is in September, 1881, when he writes to J. A.\nSymonds that \"my interest in Spiritualism has been revived.\"\nThis revival of interest was mainly due to the successful experi\nments in thought-transference carried on by Professor Barrett In\nJanuary of the following year, 1882, a conference was held in\nLondon, at Professor Barrett's invitation, to consider the question\nof forming a Society for the systematic investigation of Spiritualism\nand kindred subjects. The Conference met in the rooms of the\nBritish National Association of Spiritualists, at 38 Great Russell\nStreet, and most of those present were members of that body.\nSidgwick himself did not attend : but Myers and Gumey were both\npresent, and I can well remember the impression produced by their\nspeeches, and by the intimation made by Myers that if the new\nSociety was constituted on a sufficiently broad basis, Sidgwick would\nprobably consent to act as president. A few weeks later the Society\nwas formally constituted under his presidency.\nFor the next few years Sidgwick devoted a large part of his\nenergies to psychical research. It was not that he found much\ninterest of a sensational kind in the work; indeed he confesses \"the\ngreat inferiority of real ghost stories to sham ones . . . whether\nfor entertainment or for edification.\" Another time we find him\nremarking : \" Politics [i.e. the Science of Politics] an agreeable\nchange from Psychics.\" Nor was he conscious of being specially\nfitted for the work of investigation. He probably lacked some of\nthe physical qualifications necessary for experimental work. And\nhis wide sympathies were still too narrow to enable him adequately\nto realise the mental and moral processes of physical mediums,\nclairvoyants, and irresponsible narrators of ghost stories. But he\ngave generously, especially in the early years, both of time and\nmoney to the investigation. In the first three or four years of the\nSociety's existence we accumulated an enormous mass of evidence\u2014\nsome thousands of cases\u2014of ghost stories, apparitions, dreams, pro\nphetic visions, and the like. The aim of the Society, it will be\nrecalled, the conception which marked out its investigation from\nall previous investigations of the subject, was that it should be\n\fLII.] Review. 489\ncollective\u2014that the task of appraising the evidence should depend\nupon no single judgment. For a committee of five or six persons\nto read through in manuscript and pass judgment on each of these\nthousands of cases would have been an almost impossible task.\nSidgwick, in this difficulty, came forward and defrayed the cost of\nhaving the entire collection\u2014which mounted up week by week to\nalmost incredible totals\u2014printed on separate slips, with wide margins\nfor comments and the insertion of additional evidence. In this way\nit was possible for each member of the Literary Committee to form\nhis or her independent judgment on a case before discussing it in\nfull conclave. In all the committee's deliberations Sidgwick took a\nleading part. He also took a considerable share of the necessary\nwork of personally interviewing our informants in all parts of the\nkingdom ; and with the assistance of Mrs. Sidgwick edited the Proceed\nings and Journal from 1888 to 1897. In most other branches of the\ninvestigation he took an active part. He was on the Committee\nappointed to investigate phenomena connected with the Theosophical\nSociety, whose report was published in Proceedings, Vol. III. He\njoined in many of the earlier experiments in thought-transference. In\nparticular, in conjunction with Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr. G. A. Smith, he\nconducted an important series of experiments in thought-transference\nat Brighton in 1889, which were carried on further by Mrs. Sidgwick\nin 1890 and 1891. It was Sidgwick again who was largely respon\nsible for initiating one of the most important tasks undertaken by\nthe Society\u2014the Census of Hallucinations. This was taken up by\nthe first International Congress of Experimental Psychology (held at\nParis in 1889), and entrusted to his direction. The whole work\nwas carried out under his guidance, and with his active co\noperation at every stage, both in Committee and in the more\ntedious work, carried on outside the Committee, of preparing and\nclassifying the results ; and a report of it was presented to the\nsecond Congress, which met in London under his presidency in\n1892. He attended several stances with Eusapia Paladino at Pro\nfessor Richet's house in the He Roubaud in 1894, and took a leading\npart in the sittings held at Cambridge in 1895, which resulted in\nher exposure.\nHe had a number of sittings with Mrs. Piper during her visit to\nEngland in 1889-90, and always retained the keenest interest in her\ntrance phenomena, especially after Hodgson's report of the later\nsittings, including the \"G.P.\" series, in Proceedings, Vol. XIII. In\nshort, there was no part of the Society's work which did not claim\n\f440 Frank Podmore. [PART\nhis attention and sympathy, and in the more important lines of\nresearch he took an active share. The following extract from a\nJournal written in 1884 defines his general attitude to the subject\nat that time :\n\"There has been nothing to write about except my work . . .\nand Psychical Research, which I feel ought to be my work more\nthan it is. One effect of growing older is that I cannot really give\nmy mind to more than one thing at once ; and though I think\nPsychical Research profoundly important to mankind, whereas sound\nviews on the evolution of political ideas are a luxury easily dispensed\nwith, I am ashamed to find how much more interested I am in\nthe latter than in the former. The reason is that I feel as if I\nhad the kind of mind adapted for seeing things\u2014relations\u2014for\nmyself in the history of Thought : when I read what other people\nsay, I seem to see that they have not got it quite right; and then,\nafter an effort, what seems to be the truth comes to me. This is\nas near the sense of original production as I ever get, and only\nintellectual work that gives me this experience really takes hold\non me. Now in Psychical Research the only faculty that I seem\nable to exercise is the judicial; I fee.l equal to classifying and to\nsome extent weighing the evidence\u2014so far as it depends on general\nconclusions\u2014but I do not feel the least gift for making a legitimate\nhypothesis as to the causes of the phenomena, and I am too un\nobservant and unimaginative about physical events generally to be\nat all good at evaluating particular bits of evidence. For to tell\nwhether a 'psychical' experiment or narrative is good or not\nevidentially requires one to imagine with adequate accuracy and\nexhaustiveness the various possibilities of ' natural ' causation of the\nphenomenon, and judge the degree of improbability of each \"\n(pp. 387-88).\nAgain, in the previous year, on the occasion of a vacancy in the\nProfessorship of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge, he had written :\n\"I have decided to stand for the Professorship ... I do not\nquite see who else is to have it, and I find that the Psychical\nResearchers think it better for the cause\u2014at least this is Myers's\nview. Also it is not yet clear that Psychical Research can occupy\na great deal of one's time ; it depends on our finding ' subjects '\n(p. 368).\nAgain, in 1892, when the Society was firmly established, and no\nlonger in such urgent need of his help, he is prepared, if Mrs.\nSidgwick's engagements as Principal of Newnham College should\n\fLil.] . Review. 441\nprevent her from devoting much time to psychical research, to give\nup his own plans :\n\"If it turns out that she must sacrifice some of this work, I shall\nhave to take her place; but my intellect will be an inferior\nsubstitute for this work, and I shall give up with reluctance the\nplans of literary work for which I am better fitted. Still, if it\nmust be so, I shall give them up without hesitation, just as I should\ngive them up to fight for my country if it was invaded (by the\nway, though, I believe I am too old for that)\" (pp. 522-23).\nBut if Sidgwick was not in all respects an ideal investigator,\nthere was probably no one but himself who could have brought\nthe Society so triumphantly through its many difficulties in those\nearly years. That the term \" psychical research \" is not even now\na bye-word and a reproach is due mainly to Sidgwick's character,\nhis unquestioned sincerity, and his practical wisdom. And there\nis one other quality which belongs so much to the essence\nof Sidgwick's nature that in writing about him one is liable to\nforget that any description of it is needed. I mean his extraordinary\npower of holding his judgment in suspense. Most men when\nconfronted with an unresolved problem will plunge to one or\nanother premature solution, or lose their interest in the question.\nSidgwick could maintain his balance on the top of the fence\nindefinitely, and resist the temptation to jump down to terra firma,\nuntil it was clear to him on which side lay the truth. As Prof.\nMaitland said about him in the Independent Review (June, 1906), if\nhe had not been what he was, \"he might, as others often do, have\nforgotten the exact point where proof ended and only hope remained.\"\nAnd yet he never lost or allowed others to lose interest in the\nproblem. With this power of holding his judgment in suspense\nthere was joined a remarkable fairness and sympathetic tolerance of\nall opinions differing from his own. Other men as able and as\nsincere as Sidgwick might yet have failed to do what Sidgwick did\nin guiding the Society. For in those early days our ranks included\nmany Spiritualists and mystics of all kinds. Most men of his\nacademic culture and intellectual standing would have been tempted\nto pursue a policy which would have alienated many of the\nmembers and would certainly have narrowed the basis of the\nSociety and impaired its usefulness. We should have lost much if\nwe had missed the cordial co-operation at the outset of our Spiritualist\nfriends. But it was no easy matter to hold the balance even. The\nfirst Council included some members who were not wise, as the\n\f442 Frank Podmme. [PART\nUniversities count wisdom. Sidgwick suffered them, if not always\ngladly, at any rate with admirable patience and fairness. At one\nof the early meetings at Willis's Rooms there arose a discussion as\nto the colour of the aura which, according to certain mystics, radiates\nas a visible effluence from the human body. Some of the disputants\nmaintained that a properly constituted soul would display a blue\nradiance ; to others it was patent that pink was the colour of the\nperfect soul, and that the popular phrase which assigned blue to\nspirits of an undesirable character was justified by the facts. Sidg\nwick sat quietly in the Presidential chair during the discussion. To\nhim, as to most of us, the whole thing must have seemed nonsense,\nand pernicious nonsense, since the debate was no doubt seriously\ndamaging to the reputation of the infant Society. But his sense\nof fairness, I think, would not allow him to closure a discussion of\nthis kind on matters of which he had no personal experience. Nor\nwas he ever moved to impatience or anger by anything except\nunfair dealing and disloyalty. One such occasion I can recall.\nIn the early days of the Society it was the custom that every\npaper to be read at a meeting should first be submitted to the\nCouncil or a Committee of the Council. A paper prepared by one\nof our early members, who has long since left us, was so submitted.\nFor sufficient reasons the Committee unanimously decided that\ncertain passages ought to be omitted ; the reasons for this decision\nwere fully explained to the author of the paper, and he was\ncourteously requested to take the necessary steps. At the meeting,\nnevertheless, he read the whole paper, including the offending\npassages. It was not the affront to himself, nor even the damage\ndone to the Society's nascent reputation for common sense, but the\ndisloyalty of the act which moved Sidgwick on this occasion to\nrighteous anger.\nUnder Sidgwick's guidance the Society as we know happily lived\nthrough the perils of infancy. But to him personally the results of\nthe investigation were no doubt somewhat disappointing. In his\nlater years, indeed, though he retained to the last a keen interest\nin the work of the Society, its doings do not figure largely in\nthe correspondence here quoted. No fresh evidence of value had\nbeen obtained for the physical phenomena of Spiritualism. In 1894,\nindeed, the accounts which F. W. H. Myers and Sir Oliver Lodge\nsent of the experiments with Eusapia in the He Roubaud inspired\nfresh hope of definite conclusions being attained. And when Sidg\nwick witnessed the phenomena for himself, he was at the time\n\fReview. 443\n\"almost convinced of their genuineness.\" But this almost conviction\nyielded in the following summer to the proof of practised and\nsystematic fraud : and he came, I understand, finally to the con\nclusion that further research in this direction would be likely to\nremain unprofitable. But we gather that he attained more or less\nconviction of the reality of thought-transference. Thus on March\n30, 1887, he writes:\n\"We had interesting experiments yesterday evening in Thought-\ntransference with Miss Relph ; not guile enough success to impress\nthe public decisively, but the conditions unexceptionable, and the\nresults such as leave no doubt in my mind that I witnessed the\nreal phenomenon. It certainly is a great fact; I feel a transient\nglow of scientific enthusiasm, and find life worth living merely to\nprosecute this discovery. If only I could form the least conception\nof the modus transferendi \/ and if only we could find some percipient\nwhose time we could control a little more\" (p. 473).\nAgain on 3rd Jan., 1886, he writes:\n\"Came up to London yesterday to meeting of S.P.R. It has\nnow 600 members and associates, and I shall now let it run alone\nwithout any more nursing. I think it has done good work, as I\ndo not doubt that Thought-transference is genuine, and hope it\nwill soon be established beyond cavil ; but I see no prospect of\nmaking way in the far more interesting investigation of Spiritualism.1\nI fear our experience shows that evidence available for scientific\npurposes is not likely to be forthcoming ; still, having put our\nhands to plough this bog, it would be feeble to look back so soon\"\n(pp. 435-6).\nThere are passages in the correspondence quoted in this book\nwhich might lead one to suppose that in his later years Sidgwick\nlost almost if not altogether the hope which had encouraged him at\nthe beginning of the Society's work\u2014the hope of obtaining empirical\nevidence of a future life. In March, 1887, he writes:\n\" But at present the recognised failure of my efforts to obtain\nevidence of immortality affects me not as a Man but as a Moralist.\n1 Ethics,' says J. A. S., ' can take care of themselves.' I think I\nagree with what is meant, but should word it differently. I should\nsay ' morality can take [care] of itself,' or rather the principle of\nlife in human society can take care of morality. But howl\nPerhaps always by producing an illusory belief in immortality in\n1 \" Spiritualism \" in this passage no doubt refers, not to the physical pheno\nmena alone, but to the whole evidence for the existence of spirits.\n\f\u00a344 Frank Podmore.

But my special business is\nnot to maintain morality somehow, but to establish it logically as a\nreasoned system ; and I have declared and published that this can\nnot be done, if we are limited to merely mundane sanctions, owing\nto the inevitable divergence, in this imperfect world, between the\nindividua1's Duty and his Happiness. I said in 1874 that without\nsome datum beyond experience ' the Cosmos of Duty is reduced to\na Chaos.' Am I to recant this conviction and answer my own\narguments\u2014which no one of my numerous antagonists has yet even\ntried to answer? Or am I to use my position\u2014and draw my\nsalary\u2014for teaching that Morality is a chaos, from the point of\nview of Practical Reason ; adding cheerfully that, as man is not\nafter all a rational being, there is no real fear that morality won't\nbe kept up somehow\" (p. 472).\nAgain, after reading carefully through T. H. Green's Prolegomena\nto Ethics, he writes that he finds himself \"unable to resist the con\nviction that my intellect could not put it together into a coherent\nwhole\u2014in fact, that it would not do\u2014 and yet that probably it was\nbetter that young men should be believers in it than in anything\nI can teach them. This is a conviction adapted to make a Pro\nfessor cynical\" (p. 380).\nBut these passages were probably written in moods of depression,\nand do not, 1 am given to understand, fairly represent his final\nattitude towards the question of survival after death. Both of the\npassages just quoted, indeed, were written before the publication of\nthe Piper documents\u2014by far the most important evidence as yet\nbrought forward for the belief. And that evidence produced a\nstrong impression upon his mind, and did much to revive his\nhopes that empirical proof of a future existence might ultimately\nbe obtained. In fact he remained to the last of opinion that\nhowever dubious the result of the quest, it was our duty to\npursue it.\nHis later views on the great problems of religious belief may be\n*' Rfi From the two following passages, the first written in 1891,\nid in 1898, two years before his death.\n\fLit.] Review. 445\n\"My attitude towards Christianity is briefly this. \u2022 (1) I think\nOptimism in some form is an indispensable creed\u2014not for every\none, but for progressive humanity as a whole.

Nor is it perhaps necessary\nto add anything. The whole character of the man stands revealed\nin these extracts from his own writings. With perhaps one\nexception. It is not easy to infer from Sidgwick's own utterances\nthe existence of qualities which he, almost paradoxically, possessed\nin a high degree : his administrative capacity, his sound judgment\nin affairs, his practical wisdom. These qualities were proved, of\ncourse, not only in the guidance of the Society for Psychical\nResearch, but omnium consensu on a more conspicuous scale in his\nwork at the University and at Newnham College. I should wish,\n\f446 Frank Podm&re. [PART\nnevertheless, to add a few words on my own account on some aspects\nof his character. I was one of those \u2014and they were, I believe,\nmany,\u2014who received from Sidgwick advice and help in literary work.\nIt was given without stint. One of my earliest essays\u2014an article\nwritten for one of the monthly reviews in answer to an attack on\nthe evidence published in Phantasms of the Living\u2014was in its first\ndraft a sufficiently crude affair. Sidgwick corrected it\u2014I was going\nto write as a master might correct a schoolboy's theme\u2014but that\nwould be to give an altogether false account of his method and\nattitude. He did not correct as a master, he offered suggestions\nand advice as a fellow student. And the recipient of his advice\nwas conscious not of the humiliation of one who has his faults\npointed out to him, but only of the illumination which conies from\nan insight recognised as deeper and truer than his own. At a\nlater date Sidgwick read through before publication the whole of\nmy first two books on psychical research. He found time also in\nthe year before his death to read much of the typescript of the\nfirst volume of my Modern Spiritualism. It would be difficult to\noverestimate what I gained from his criticism. There lie before\nme as I write several pages of notes and suggestions, written in\nhis exquisitely clear handwriting, on the book last mentioned.\nEarely indeed did I venture to disregard his suggestions\u2014not\nbecause they were his, but because they carried with them con\nviction. It was by no means only in the handling of the evidence\nthat his advice was of value. I found that it was no less helpful\nin the literary treatment of the subject. For no doubt in literature,\nas in science or philosophy, it is the single eye which is needed.\nSidgwick, I should suppose, did not consciously aim at literary effect.\nBut he achieved it, and taught others to achieve it, by virtue of\nseeing things truly. He would point out where the loose-fitting\nconventional phrase misrepresented the facts, or where a piece of\nslovenly thinking marred the argument : and in correcting these\nfaults one found with surprise that one had improved the manner\nof the writing no less than the matter.\nAnd this naturally leads to another point. No one who knew\nSidgwick only from his most important philosophical works could\nfoVm any fair idea of the man. Ordinary reviewers were apt to\nfind his writing heavy and dull. He himself, referring to the\nreception of one of his books, expressed the hope that he might\nyet write literature before he died. But he wrote under a deep\nsense of responsibility. Perhaps for good literature there is needed\n\fLIL] Review. 447\na certain indirectness of treatment, a certain play of personality\nwhich he would have felt to be out of place in dealing with the\nultimate problems of philosophy. Certainly the literary grace and\nthe humour which are lacking in his more serious works abounded\nin his letters and in some of his earlier essays. His treatment of\nMatthew Arnold in the essay on \"The Prophet of Culture\" is not\nmore admirable for the justice of the criticism than for the genial\nsatire employed. His presidential addresses to our Society in the\nearly days are wonderfully effective. And the letters included in\nthis volume fascinate equally by their wide sympathies as by the\ngrace of their style and by their abounding humour.\nAnd what is true of his letters was, of course, equally true of his\nconversation. His talk was always alive with sympathy and with\nhumour. Humour is a perishable flower, very difficult to transplant\nfiom its native soil. But one illustration may be quoted from the\nbook before us. Sidgwick had read a paper on Green's philosophy\nbefore an Oxford Society. The burden of his criticism, in Mr.\nSchiller's words, was \" that there existed a fundamental incoherence\nin Green's thinking. When he had finished, the disciples of Green\ngot up oiie after the other\u2014and admitted it ! Only they thought\nthat it might be cured by going on from Green in various directions\nto Hegel, to natural science, etc. Finally a prominent Hegelian\nmade the inevitable suggestion that such fundamental incoherence\nmerely indicated that the region of the ultimate difficulties of thought\nhad been reached, and inferred that both sides of the contradiction\nshould be sustained. This gave Sidgwick his opportunity. After\nreplying to the other criticisms, he went on to say that 'as for the\nremarks of the last speaker, he had never been able to make out\nfrom the school to which he evident1y belonged how they managed\nto distinguish the contradictions which they took to be evidence of\nerror from those which they regarded as intimations of higher\ntruth. ' \"\nBut there was one special quality, which all who met Sidgwick\nmust have recognised in him, which gave him, indeed, a unique\nposition in his generation. The most appropriate name for this\nquality\u2014a name soiled of recent years by much ignoble use\u2014is,\nI suppose, humility. This humility was no doubt native to him.\nBut it must have been fostered and developed by the circumstances\nof his life. To most men who set out on the search for truth\nthere comes, no doubt, a time when they are content to find rest\nin some half-way house. To Sidgwick no halting place was possible,\n\f'448 Frank Podmore. [PART\nshort of the goal ; and the goal he never reached. A man who is\nable to accept such an experience\u2014to acknowledge defeat and still\nto pursue\u2014must certainly have learnt humility. And this quality\nis shewn in his whole attitude towards psychical research. Most\nmen of Sidgwick's intellectual standing \"sniffed\"\u2014as Sidgwick says\nof T. H. Green\u2014at the very idea of looking for instruction in ghost\nstories and table-turning. But to Sidgwick nothing was common\nor unclean. And just as no fact was to him too insignificant to be\nworthy of study, so no person was so foolish but that something\nmight be learned from him. Thus he writes to Mrs. Sidgwick\u2014\n\" I am sorry you are plagued with the correspondence with . . . ;\nat the same time I cannot help thinking that you may derive\ninstruction from this, and from the criticisms in Light, if you can\nget yourself into the state of mind of taking a large amount of\nmisunderstanding and misrepresentation as inevitable, and merely\nendeavour to extract the grains of useful suggestion. At least, I\nmyself have always learnt from criticism when I could get into\nthis state of mind about it\" (p. 395).\nAnd none of us who ever talked with Sidgwick or sat with him\nin Council can have failed to be struck by the attention\u2014an atten\ntion amounting almost to deference\u2014with which he would listen\nto the opinions of the youngest and least considerable of those\npresent. There are many testimonies in the book to this quality\nof Sidgwick's mind. Thus a former pupil, Miss Gardner, writes\nof his teaching, \"he treated our remarks as respectfully as if they\nhad been made by some eminent critic. One felt that, however\nwide the difference between one's own mind and his might be, he\nregarded each one of us as, in a sense, a fellow-seeker after truth\nand clearness; and the feeling brought stimulus and hope\" (p. 312).\nAnd Leslie Stephen testifies to the same effect :\n\"He was not only perfectly frank but. glad to gain enlightenment\neven from comparatively commonplace minds. Johnson commended\na talker who would fairly put his mind to yours. That marks one\nof Sidgwick's merits. He would take up any topic ; made no pre\ntension to superiority, and was as willing to admit ignorance or\nerror as he was always fertile in new lights\" (p. 315).\nSidgwick aptly expresses his own position thus :\n\"I do not think I was made to be a teacher of age and dignity:\nI like talking to young men, but I like talking to them as an\nequal ...\" (p. 488).\nAnd if he gained profit by this singular openness of mind, we\n\fLii.] . .Review. 449\nwho were honoured by his attention gained more. It was impossible\nfor the most diffident to feel otherwise than at ease in his presence.\nBut it was not an ease which conduced to sloth. His conversation\nacted as a moral and intellectual stimulant. His sincerity evoked\na like sincerity in those with whom he conversed. One would have\nfelt ashamed in Sidgwick's presence to express any opinion that was\nslovenly or superficial, or to advocate a course inspired by any\nignoble motive.\nThe end of his life was of a piece with all the rest. Indeed, the\nmere suggestion that it could have been otherwise would seem an\nimpertinence to his memory. Early in May, 1900, he learnt that\nhe was suffering from internal cancer, and that an immediate oper\nation was necessary. For the rest of the month he went about his\nwork, feeling that after the operation there might be no further\nopportunity for work. He put his papers in order as far as the\ntime permitted, prepared an address on the philosophy of T. H.\nGreen for the Oxford Philosophical Society, attended a meeting of\nthe Newnham Council, and fulfilled other engagements. For a fort\nnight or so he had kept the news from all his friends. But as the\ntime for the operation approached he found it necessary to speak.\nHe wrote to F. W. H. Myers on the 24th May to tell him, adding:\n\" Life is very strange now, very terrible, but I try to meet it like\na man, my beloved wife aiding me. I hold on\u2014or try to hold\non\u2014to duty and love, and through love to touch the larger hope.\nI wish now I had told you before, as this may be farewell. Your\nfriendship has had a great place in my life, and as I walk through\nthe Valley of the Shadow of Death I feel your affection. Pray for\nme\" (p. 587).\nHe took leave of his friends in Cambridge, and came up to London\non the day before the operation, which took place on the 31st. During\nthe weeks of convalescence he saw and talked with many friends.\nHe sent me a message asking me to visit him, and I gladly went.\nAt that time he knew, I think, that he had at most a year or two\nto live, and the end actually came before the summer was over.\nBut he seemed unchanged in his outlook on life, with his interest\nin all things as fresh as ever. I remember his telling me about\nsome novels which he had just read, being at that time, I suppose,\ntoo weak to undertake more serious reading, and asking me if I\ncould recommend him any more. He talked about the affairs of the\nS.P.R. and other matters with the same bright and sympathetic\ninterest which he had always shewn. At my second visit he\n\f450 Frank Podmore. [PART\nhad just returned from a drive to Regent's Park, where he had\nrather overtaxed his strength in attempting to walk. But though\nobviously tired he would not send me away, but asked me to come\nin, and conversed for a few minutes with his habitual cheerfulness\nand humour. I never saw him again, and the end came a few weeks\nlater, on the 28th August.\nMr. Haldane, in his recent address to the University of Edinburgh,\nhas described what should be the function of a University in the\nnational life : that the best minds should there receive their training\nfor the highest service to the state. I do not know where there\ncould be found a finer example than that exhibited by Henry\nSidgwick of the \" dedicated life \" which Mr. Haldane describes\u2014a\nlife dedicated, however, not to the state, but to humanity\u2014a life\nwholly given to the strenuous search for Truth, and finding in that\nsearch its sole and sufficient reward. Nearly all lives\u2014our own or\nothers\u2014as we look back on them must seem desultory and incomplete.\nBut Henry Sidgwick's had a unity and completeness beyond that\nof most men. I do not mean that it was complete if measured by\nthe results, for of the results we are scarcely yet able to judge. But\nif we consider not the achievement but the purpose, we shall find\nthat Sidgwick's life presented more than others a symmetrical whole.\nIts symmetry was marred by no infirmity of endeavour, by no self-\nseeking, by no petty personal aims. His years were continuously\nspent from youth upwards in the one high impersonal quest. In\nlooking back on such a life we can see \" age approve of youth, and\ndeath complete the same.\"\nOne of his friends writes that on May 27th, a few days before the\noperation, Sidgwick recited some stanzas from Swinburne's \"Super\nFlumina Babylonis.\" I well remember some years ago to have\nheard him recite the same lines, lines which may appropriately\nfurnish his own epitaph :\n\" Unto each man his handiwork, unto each his crown\nThe Just Fate gives;\nWhoso takes the world's life on him, and bis own lays down,\nHe, dying so, lives.\"\nFRANK PODMORE.\n\fill.] Review. 451\nBorderland of Psychical Research.

The three, taken together, form a very handy reference\nlibrary on all things 'psychic' for the average person who has neither\nthe time nor the patience to wade through the complete Reports\nin the Society's Proceedings. I shall first of all give a rapid\nrtsnmt of the contents of eacli volume ;\u2014the detailed discussions\nand cases are doubtless known to members of the S.P.R., since it\nis from the Proceedings and Journals of the Society that most of the\nfacts are drawn.\nDr. Hyslop begins the Borderland with chapters on \" Sense\nPerception,\" \" Interpreting and Associating Functions of the Mind,\"\n\" Memory and Dissociation and Obliviscence \"\u2014all of which are\nmuch needed (in this country, at least, where so much pseudo-\nscientific research is carried on), in order to give the public a\ngood general view of the way the mind works in health, and to-\npresent clearly the position and the theories of the scientific world\nin relation to these questions. It is fair to state that the vast\nmajority of persons have ' no objection ' to the theory of a future\nlife, simply because they do not realize the arguments against it\nwhich are urged by the scientific world, nor the strength of the\nmaterialistic position ; and it is a good thing that these objections\nshould be made clear to the public mind. When this has been\ndone, the position and the importance of the phenomena dealt with\nby psychical research will be better understood.\nNext follow two most interesting chapters on \" Illusions \" and\n\" Hallucinations \"\u2014giving a clear idea of the theories held to-day\nwith regard to the nature and initiation of these mental states, and\nmuch more discussion which we cannot stop to consider. The next\nchapter, \" Pseudo-Spiritistic Phenomena,\" is very fine indeed, and\n2o\n\f452 Hereward Carrington. [PART\nbrings us into the field of psychic phenomena proper. It is mostly\n\u2022destructive in character, however, as the title might lead us to\nsuppose, and deals with the fraud connected with the subject\n\u2022(especially with the Physical Phenomena) containing, among other\nthings, a very detailed and excellent discussion of the Slade-Zollner\ninvestigation. Besides the objections urged by Mrs. Sidgwick, iu\nher discussion of the evidence in this case (Proceedings, Vol. IV.),\nDr. Hyslop points out eleven sources of error, or defects in the\nevidence,\u2014every one of which is highly important. The discussion\n\u2022of slate-writing phenomena, ballot-tests, etc., is also interesting,\nand the whole chapter is well worth reading by any one interested\nin these problems ; and certainly should be read by all those who\nare too ready to credit the physical phenomena as genuine.\nThe next chapter, \" Subconscious Action and Secondary Person\nality,\" summarizes\u2014after some interesting preliminary discussion\u2014\nthe Morton Prince ' Sally Beauchamp ' Case ; Janet's ' Leonie ' Case ;\nthe Ansel Bourne Case ; Flournoy's ' Mile. Smith ' Case ; a Case of\nhis own, closely resembling the last mentioned, and others. The\n'material is mostly familiar to readers of the Proceedings, but should\nprove most useful to the average reader, in helping to make clear\nto his mind this perplexing question of double and multiplex\npersonality. The man-in-the-street is inclined to regard every\nintelligence foreign to the normal consciousness as a \" spirit \" ; and\nit is a useful piece of work to make clear the fact that this need\n\u2022not be the explanation of it.\nA chapter on \" Mind and Body '> follows\u2014this being divided into\ntwo portions; first, a discussion of the theories of the inter-relations\n\u2022of mind and body from the philosophic standpoint ; and, secondly,\na discussion of the influence of the mind upon the body,\u2014as\ninstanced in various cures, the cases of \"miraculous healing,\" etc.\nThis brings us naturally to the next chapter, \"Hypnotism and\nTherapeutics,\" the contents of which need not be discussed at any\nlength here. Following this is perhaps the most interesting chapter\nin the book,\u2014that on \"Reincarnation.\" Professor Hyslop evidently\ndoes not think much of the theory from any point of view\u2014\n\u2022contending that it is not the most rational theory, from a purely\nphilosophical point of view, and that it has no real evidence in its\nfavour. The cases of \" Memory of past lives \"\u2014so often referred to\nby believers in this theory\u2014Dr. Hyslop considers to be due to illusions\nand hallucinations of memory, or to the eruption into consciousness\nof forgotten dreams or subconsciously noted impressions, or te\n\fLII.] Review. 453\nimpressions noted before the age of four, when the personality is\nin process of formation, and when no consecutive mental record of\nthe life is kept, only isolated incidents remembered. Dr. Hyslop\nurges that scenes and incidents noted or remembered in any of\nthese states\u2014at any such times\u2014would have a tendency to emerge\ninto consciousness as new impressions, since they were not previously\nassociated with the normal waking personality ; and yet such an\nimpression, owing to the fact that it had actually been experienced\nbefore, would have a tendency to be associated with some past\nevent in the mental life, because of its feeling of 'familiarity.' As\nit does not belong to the conscious life of the individual, it may be\nrelegated by him to some past ' incarnation.'\n\" Reservations and Morals \" is the title of the last chapter, and\nits title sufficiently explains its contents.\nThe second book, \"Enigmas of Psychical Research,\" I must\nsummarize even more briefly than the first book, for the reason\nthat the contents are doubtless more familiar to the reader of the\nSociety's Proceedings than those of the other work. It contains\nchapters on \" Crystal Gazing,\" \" Telepathy,\" \" Dreams,\" \" Appari\ntions,\" \"Clairvoyance,\" \"Premonitions,\" \" Mediumistic Phenomena,\"\nand \" The Residues of Science \"\u2014all of which titles sufficiently\nindicate the character of the contents in each case. There is a\nchapter on \" Ancient Oracles,\" which is highly interesting,\u2014as is the\nfinal chapter, \" Retrospect and Vaticination.\" Dr. Hyslop has an\ningenious theory to account for premonitions, which is all the\nmore welcome because of the scarcity of hypotheses put forward to\nexplain them. In the chapter on \" Mediumistic Phenomena,\" Dr.\nHyslop has devoted several pages to his ' Smead Case '\u2014which bids\nfair to parallel Mrs. Piper's, if sufficient means can be raised to\ncarry on the investigation as systematically as has been done in the\nlatter case.\nThe third volume, \" Science and a Future Life,\" deals almost\nentirely with the ' Piper Case,' and is by far the most interesting\nof the three. One can see that the writer's heart is in this volume\n\u2014while purely intellectual belief and interest prompted the others.\nThe first chapter, \" Origin of Psychic Research,\" traces back the\ninvestigations into these fields in a most interesting manner; while\nthe second chapter, \" General Problems and Results,\" summarizes\nthe work of the S.P.R. to date. Then comes the chapter on \"The\nProblem of a Future Life,\" and this places before the reader the\nreal problems at issue in a terse and excellent manner. What the\n202\n\f454 Hereward Carrington. [PART\n\" real problems \" are is made clear, as well as the methods that\nshould be adopted in order to reach any sound conclusions. Here,\nagain, there is much misunderstanding in the public mind, which\nhopelessly mixes up physical phenomena, predictions, and what-not,\nwith the real question at issue\u2014the persistence of, and possibility of\ncommunication with, an individual consciousness, after the death of\nthe physical body. All other arguments are purely subsidiary to this\none: can consciousness continue to function in the absence of the\noerve-tissue, with which it is invariably bound up in this life)\nObviously the only way to prove that it can do so, is to prove that\nit actually does so, and that is a question of scientific fact, a question\nof evidence. \"Philosophy,\" says our author, \"is useless and worthless\"\nin settling this question of a future life. The whole question is one\nof evidence\u2014of proof, of fact. That is the attitude in which to\napproach this problem ; and the Piper case is so important because\nit has supplied us (apparently) with these facts.\nThe rest of the book, accordingly, is written around this case\u2014\nthe following chapters being the \" History of the Piper Case,\"\n\" Incidents from the English Report,\" \" Dr. Hodgson's First Eeport,\"\n\" Dr. Hodgson's Second Report,\" \" Personal Experiments and\nResults,\" \" The Telepathic Hypothesis,\" \" The Spiritistic Hypothesis,\"\nand \" Difficulties and Objections \"\u2014all being practically a summary\nof the Reports mentioned, and the arguments contained therein.\nIn the final chapter, \" Ethical Meaning and Results,\" Dr. Hyslop\nhas emphasized most strongly the importance of the phenomena,\nbecause of the tremendous consequences that are involved in their\nproof or their disproof; for it may almost be said that on the Piper\nCase hinges a materialistic or a spiritualistic outlook upon the\nuniverse.\nDr. Hyslop devotes a whole chapter to a consideration of the\n\"Conditions affecting the 'Communicators'\"\u2014this being virtually\nan extension and further defence of the arguments brought forward\nin his Report. The spiritistic theory is presented in so fascinating\na manner that it seems almost impossible to resist accepting it as\nat least a \" working hypothesis.\"\nOne or two quotations will show the fairness and impartiality of\nthe book. Speaking of the objection to the spiritistic theory based\nupon the triviality of the facts obtained through the medium, the\nauthor says : \" If the facts make the spiritistic theory the only\nrational supposition possible to explain them, it has to be accepted\nwhether desirable or not. Our business as scientists is not with the\n\fLii.j Review. 455\ndesirability of a next life, but with the fact of it. We have to\naccept the life to come, if it be a fact, without any ability to escape\nit, and its degenerated nature would not affect the evidence for the\nfact of it. Its being a madhouse or an asylum for idiots would\nnot weaken the evidence for its existence. We should have to bear\nwith it stoically, and perhaps, if our moral lives were what they\nought to be, that degenerate condition, if it be the natural consequence\nof action when living, might not follow. In any case, however, the\ndesirability or undesirability of a future existence has nothing to do\nwith the scientific question whether it is a fact\" (pp. 299-300).\nAnd again on p. 364 we read :\n\" If a future life is a fact we cannot disprove it by laughing at\nphenomena that we do not like. Our aesthetics have no more to\ndo with the fact than they have with the eclipse of the sun or\nwith the existence of disease. Emotional contempt of the facts is\nno more legitimate than the condemned emotional interest in a\nfuture life, and if it be a fact, we shall not escape it by cultivating\nindifference to its truth.\"\nIt is to be hoped that the publication of these three books will\nhasten the day when psychical research will become, not only a\n' respectable ' study, but an actual and vital science.\nHEREWARD CARRINGTON.\nThe Subconscious. BY JOSEPH JASTROW, Professor of Psychology\nin the University of Wisconsin. (London, Archibald Constable\n& Co., Ltd. ; Boston and New York, Houghton, Mifflin & Co.,\n1906.)\nProfessor Jastrow's book offers a comprehensive and sober-\nminded survey of the manifestations of the subconscious, alike\nin normal and in abnormal conditions, and a cautious attempt\nto explain them in accordance with the general principles of\nbiological evolution.\nThere is little new material in the book. There are indeed\na few cases of dreams and of reverie and abstraction in normal\nlife, from the author's own experience, or that of his pupils.\nBut all the more striking illustrations are taken from published\nsources\u2014our own Proceedings, the works of William James,\nFlournoy, Morton Prince, Boris Sidis, Janet, and others. One\nirritating defect in the presentation of the illustrative cases is\nthat references are rarely given to the original publication.\n\f456 frank Podmore. [PABT\nMaterial, for instance, which originally appeared in our\nProceedings is laid under contribution, but I can find but one\nsolitary reference to the source. It can hardly be supposed that\nProfessor Jastrow is willing to borrow from us, but afraid to\nimperil his reputation for scientific orthodoxy by acknowledging\nthe debt. The omission is, I prefer to think, to be attributed\nto his general indifference to detail of this kind. His citations\nare commonly introduced by some such phrase as ' ' Mr. Galton\nhas recorded,\" or \"Sir William Ramsay's experience\"\u2014and we\nlook in vain for the footnote which should tell us where the\noriginal is to be found. Akin to this omission of references is\nanother defect. There is nowhere any clear summary of the\nargument : the so-called ' ' Table of Contents \" is but a list of\nthe titles of the chapters. This makes the argument unnecessarily\ndifficult to follow ; and throws upon the reader, or reviewer,\nmuch labour which should, I venture to think, have been under\ntaken by the author.\nBut these defects apart, the book is a valuable one, as con\ntaining a sober statement of the rationalist position. An\nessential part of the thesis is that personality\u2014the conscious\nself\u2014is to be regarded less as a growth than as an achievement,\nsomething won by labour and retained only by constant vigilance ;\nand as liable, during any intermission of that vigilance, to\ncontinual encroachments from lower phases of consciousness :\n\" Personality has been set forth not as an inevitable datum,\nbut as an achievement,\u2014truly a normal issue furthered by the\nordinary vicissitudes of life, yet one whose establishment may\ninvolve struggle and compromise, relinquishment, and concen\ntrated as well as sustained purpose. The manner by which such\nan issue arises, and the essential contribution thereto of the\nlower registers of consciousness, indicate that failure in this\nrespect must proceed from a comprehensive disordering of all\nthe constituent phases of the mind's progressions.\" (pp. 518-9.)\nNormally, the part of the subconscious is mainly to act as\nan auxiliary\u2014to enrich and supplement, not to guide or supplant.\nBut Professor Jastrow is by no means inclined to depreciate\nthe importance of the function assigned to the subconscious\n\" The comment (by Mr. Leland), that the ' man who built a\nRomanesque cathedral worked by the suggestion of minds which\nwent before him,' may be extended to all notable forms of human\nendeavour. Styles, schools, creeds, philosophies come and go;\n\fLIL] Review. 457\nand the allegiances which they command flourish by the traditions\nthat they embody, that give sympathy of aim as well as con\ncordance of expression to the brotherhood of disciples. '\n\" In all these cultural sequences of human destiny the great\nmomentum of subconsciously absorbed and subconsciously trans\nmitted traditions vivifies the onward movement, and leaves its\nindelible impress upon the history and upon the quality of the\nrace. It does so by compensating the advances that result from\nthe penetration born of reasoned concepts, the practical mastery\nthat is the reward of an expert rationality, with the intuitive\ninsight, that, though subject to waywardness and lame in defence,\nis keen-witted for the true, devoted with strenuous conviction\nto the right, delicately sensitive to the beautiful. Without the\ncumulative inheritance of tradition, as also without the bold\nflights of imagination, reason would proceed at a snai1's pace ;\nfor all art requires alike, critical acumen and skilled, deeply\ningrained proficiency. The scientific spirit\u2014the most finished\nexpression of conscious activity\u2014finds its saving balance in the\nimpressible imagination, \u2014the richest quarry of the subconscious.\nIn all character, as in all achievement, there are talents more\nefficient than those consciously exercised, powers deeper than those\nwe wittingly command, that enable us to do better than we know\nhow. This recognition has ever been present in the conception\nof genius, picturing its incomprehensibility as an unquestioning\nresponse to an inspiration, as a surrender to the natural forces\nthat seethe within, thougfc reinforced by experience ; as in its\nlabours indifferent to means, oblivious to the why and wherefore,\nbut firmly possessed with the imperative importance of its\nmessage, and leaving lowlier tasks to lesser minds that are con\nstrained with painful deliberation to marshal in simple order\nthe limited resources at their command. In this appraisement\nof the constituents of character, of the service of ideals in shaping\nculture, as of the quality of talents that further mental achieve\nment, do the traditional wisdom of the ages and the analyses of\npsychology find common issue.\" (pp. 158-9.)\nThe latter part of the book is devoted to showing the analogies\nbetween the extremest forms of dissociated and impaired con\nsciousness, and the deviations from full consciousness found in\nperfectly normal persons. Thus, the man who hunts for the\nspectacles which are actually fixed on his forehead, or cuts into\nthe leg of mutton and then, in view of the gaping wound,\n\f458 Frank Podmvre.

In both cases the sum of conscious attention is not\nenough to go round :\n\" For the pronounced hysterical temperament, wide or well-\nmaintained alertness of mind is difficult : two activities, though\nof slight import, can no longer be maintained at once ; to give\nattention to a small area of experience involves the momentary\nloss of the rest. The spread of the search-light of attention is\nmuch reduced, while also its power of illumination is enfeebled.\nThe mental blinders\u2014though peculiarly selective in what they\nadmit and exclude\u2014are worn more and more continuously ; the\ncontracted habit of consciousness is formed. Systematic gaps in\nperception and in the control of the expressive agencies of the\nintellect are at first tolerated, then resignedly or stolidly accepted.\nThe patient forgets to include her arm within her conscious\nconcern ; and it remains neglected, possibly in a permanently\ncontracted attitude.\" (p. 316.)\nHere again is an explanation on rationalist principles of the\nfeats of arithmetic performed by calculating boys :\n\" Arithmetical prodigies, along with painters, poets, and\nwriters, are apt to project a situation in a brilliant visual image,\nas remarkable for the scope and complexity of details as for its\naccuracy and ready command. They see as on imaginary black\nboards, or like the fleeting exposure of a picture thrown upon\nthe screen, the partial resultant of their complex calculations.\nWith closed eyes and a strained inner vision, they build up their\nconstructions with large inclusive spans of procedure, so sup-\npressedly reasoned that results seem to follow upon premises by\nsome prompted insight, and equations yield their solutions as in\na flash. By extensive and intimately familiarized material held\never ready for service ; by passionate and incessant devotion to\nfigures; by ceaseless rumination over primes and squares and\nroots and products ; by facile devising of short-cut procedures\nthat bring result close to premise, there is acquired a great mass\nof ' understudied ' material, mental tables of predigested results,\nin the manipulation of which formulated procedures come to play\na decreasing part. The planning and the sectional construction\nare, in the main, consciously directed and consummated, and are\nsupported at every stage by the minor operations facilitated to\nthe point of mechanical automatism, and filling in the niches of\n\fLII.] Review. 459\nthe construction as fast as they arise. Moreover, effort accom\npanies the task, and in some fair proportion to its unfamiliarity\nand intrinsic difficulty ; in brief, the result, however notable,\nmaintains an intelligible relation to the normal type of ante\ncedents, and may thus be included within the instances of\nexalted facilitation dependent alike upon temperament and\ncultivation.\" (pp. 468-9.)\nThese quotations will serve to illustrate the scope of the book.\nThe qualities especially distinguishing the work are sobriety of\njudgment and clearness of analysis. The style is picturesque and\noften forcible and illuminating. But as a whole it suffers from\na Teutonic habit of thought ; the sentences are often like\nportmanteaus packed too full. Take these two as illustrations.\nThe author desires to put the question whether the dreams that\nwe remember adequately represent our dream life as a whole, and\nthis is how he phrases it :\n\" Is the position warranted that accepts the testimony of\nmemory, controlled by the usual experimental precautions (in\nthis instance, the recognition of the many dreams that occur,\nbut are forgotten), as worthy of the same regard as attaches to\nthe careful introspective account of any of our mental pro\ncedures?\" (pp. 176-7.) Or again, take this sentence:\n\" From an experimental approach, it has been determined that\nif one persists in judging the comparative brightness of two tints\nlong after these have been so equalized that the eye has lost all\ndifference between them, the judgments thus accumulated without\nconfidence and seemingly by guesswork prove that the judging\nmechanism, in spite of its low introspective rating, reports in\nslight favor of the actually brighter tint. Its preferences in\nthis distrusted region remain consistently placed ; and the balance\nin favor of the really brighter stimulus decreases as the actual\ndifference in tint itself grows less.\" (p. 417.)\nIt seems to me an unfair tax upon a reader's patience to\npresent him with conundrums of this kind.\nIt should be added that the name of F. W. H. Myers does not\nappear in the Index of the book, though a few pages of the final\nchapter are devoted to a criticism, mainly on the ground of its\ninconsistency with the progress of evolution, of the theory of the\nsubconscious of which Myers was the most eminent exponent.\nIn the following passage in the preface Professor Jastrow defines\nhis general attitude:\n\f460 Frank Podmore. [PART mj\n\" Only a few, and in the main slight, general surveys of the\nfield have been published. The one notable exception is the\nwork of the late Mr. Frederic W. H. Myers (Human Personality,\n2 vols., 1903). In respect to that, I record with pleasure my\nappreciation of the ability and devotion of the author, as well\nas of the skill of his presentations; and I record with regret,\nthat in spite of a 'common interest in the same ranges of pheno\nmena, and a fair measure of agreement in the interpretation of\nthe more objective and verifiable data, I yet find my point of\nview so little in accord with his, that I have been able to profit\nbut slightly by his discerning labors.\"\nFRANK PODMORE.\n\f\f\fFORMER PRESIDENTS OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL\nRESEARCH.\n1882-1884.\n1885-1887.\n1888-1892.\n1893.\n1894-1895.\n1896-1899.\n1900.\n1901-1903.\n1904.\n1905.\n1906.\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick, ....\nProfessor Balfour Stewart, F.R.S., -\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick, ....\nThe Right Hon.
