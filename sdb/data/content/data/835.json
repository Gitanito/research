The Review of Scientific Illuminism.\r\n 1909-1919  Semiannual\r\n London, England; Detroit, MI.  Publisher: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Company; Universal Publishing Co. (Detroit).  Editor: Aleister Crowley.  Succeeded by: Equinox (Nashville, 1979); Equinox (New York, 1986); \u00c4equinox (Zurich, 1954); etc.\r\n 1\/1, March 1909-1\/10 fall 1913; suspended 1914-1918, and begun again with 3\/1, March 1919, which was published in Detroit, MI and is known within O.T.O. circles as the \"Blue Equinox.\"  Volumes 2 and 3\/2 were never published.  3\/3 was published in September 1936 (though some copies have the date December 1937 pasted on the title page), 3\/4 in 1939 (and reissued in Dallas, Texas, in 1969 by Sangreal Foundation), and 3\/5 in 1944.  The journal was revived under the same name in New York in 1986, beginning with 3\/10, counting several Crowley pamphlets as 3\/6-3\/9 in the volume numbering.   There have been other attempts to continue the journal. This was Crowley's  attempt to spread the word of his magical activities and prowess in ritual, sexual magic and Enochian evocations. The journal was largely written by Crowley (1875-1947) himself,  under his own name and a variety of pseudonyms, and contains his disquisitions on the revelations he had received together with his crabby comments on his fellows and followers.  Crowley was aided in editing the journal by John Frederick Charles Fuller (1878-1966), later Major-General.  Contributions by Leila Waddell, Victor B. Neuburg, Lord Dunsany, Frank Harris, W.B.
