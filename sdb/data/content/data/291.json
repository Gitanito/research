He published two books, Evidence of Personal Survival from Cross-Correspondences and Foreknowledge,&nbsp;later reprinted in a single volumeThe Future and Beyond.&nbsp;   Contents   \tLife and Career  \tPsychical Research   \tMediumship \tCross Correspondences \tPrecognition \tWorks  \tBooks \tArticles \tBook Reviews   \tLiterature \tEndnotes     Life and Career\n\nHerbert Francis Saltmarsh was born on 16 July 1881 in Highgate, London. He started his professional career in the shipping business, but ill-health forced him to retire at an early age, after which he devoted himself to psychical research and theosophical philosophy.  Psychical Research\n\nSaltmarsh joined the&nbsp;Society for Psychical Research&nbsp;in 1921 and was co-opted to its governing council in 1931. In 1939 he was appointed a trustee of the Society\u2019s Research Endowment Fund and he took over the work of treasurer.  Mediumship\n\nIn an experiment with the medium Mrs Warren Elliott, Saltmarsh tested the extent to which statements accepted as true by a sitter might be accepted by other people, not involved in the sitting, as being true also for them. Details from sittings in which a young pilot killed in action purported to communicate were sent to families who had suffered a similar loss, and scores made of their relevance. Chance correspondences occasionally approached those of the real sitting, but the average score for the pilot\u2019s family was four to five times over chance, and in another case, six to seven times over chance.\n\nThese experiments are discussed at length by philosopher CD Broad in his 1962 Lectures in Psychical Research. Broad praises Saltmarsh\u2019s methodology while dissenting from his conclusions.1  Cross Correspondences\n\nThe Cross Correspondences is the name given to a series of automatic scripts received by mediums and automatists in the early twentieth century that showed an interlinked pattern of themes and topics, apparently an attempt by deceased psychical researchers to give convincing evidence of having survived death. In&nbsp;Evidence of Personal Survival from Cross-Correspondences, Saltmarsh provides a clear model of the intricacy of this material, as he describes it, \u2018in the spirit of judicial summing-up and not of advocacy\u2019.2  Precognition\n\nIn a 1934 study, Saltmarsh analyses 349 cases of ostensible precognition reported in the SPR\u2019s records. The majority were found to be in dreams, and of these, 76 were reported as highly evidential and 40 significantly so.3\n\nSaltmarsh\u2019s second book Foreknowledge (1938) presents cases of precognition from the SPR\u2019s records and other sources which, he considers, require \u2018a multitude of stretched hypotheses if they are to be explained away\u2019.4 He discusses possible theoretical approaches, including the nature of time, concepts developed by JW Dunne (author of a best-selling 1930s book on precognitive dreams), and comparisons with basic memory functions.
