HODGSON'S INVESTIGATIONS IN INDIA.\nThose members of our Society who have read the J!'irst Report of\nthe Committee appointed to investigate the Evidence for Marvellous\nPhenomena offered by certain members of the Theosophical Society, will\nbe mterested to hear that Mr:Hodgson, a member ofthe Committee, has\nbeen conducting the inyestigation on the spot energetically and im-\npartially-; and that he is now, we believe, on his way back. He has al-\nready sent home a considerable mass of documents, including depositions\nof witnesses mentioned in the First Report, &c. The additional evidence\nis for the most part unfavourable to the genuineness of the phenomena,\nand Mr. Hodgson inclines, we believe, to the conclusion that the alleged\nmarvels are altogether to. be attributed to fraud. His grounds for this\neonclusion, and his views as to the most probable explanation of the\nmarvels, will be fully discussed in a Second Report which will be pre-\nsented to the Society shortly after Mr. Hodgson's return.\nMr. Hodgson found that the editor of the Madras Christian College\nMagazine, who is now the possessor of the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters,\nwas quite willing to submIt the question of their genuineness to the\ndecision of a professional expert. Accordingly a certain number of the\nletters, which Madame Coulomb affirms herself to have received froni\nMadame Blavatsky in her own name, have been sent for examination\nto the well-known expert, Mr. F. G. Netherclift, with some undisputed\nspecimens of Madame Blavatsky's handwriting. His report, which is\nunfavourable to Madame Blavatsky, will be laid before the Society\nalong with the rest of the evidence. Meantime, the following descrip-\ntion which Mr. Hodgson gives of an experience of his whenvisiting the\nCoulombs, will at any rate show that the latter would be useful con-\nfederates in any conspiracy to produce fraudulent phenomena.\n\" Madras, January 9th, 1885.\n\" This morning I called upon the Coulombs, who are living at the house\nof Mrs. Dyer in St. Thome. I conversed a short time with M. Coulomb\nbefore Madame Coulomb appeared. In the course of the conversation that fol-\nlowed I remarked, concerning certain cases of premonition, that I had no satis-\nfact~ry theory at present to account for them. At this moment something\nwhite a.ppeared, touching my hlloir, and fell on the floor. It was a letter. I\npicked it up. It was addressed to myself. M. and Madame Coulomb were\nsitting near me and in front of me. I had observed no motion on their part\nwhich could account for the appearance of the letter. Examining the ceiling\nas I stood I could detect no flaw ; it appeared intact. On opening the letter\nI found it referred to the conversation which had just taken place. I tran-\nscribe the words ;-\n\" , Because the existing cause of to-day foretells the effect of to-morrow-\na bud assures us beforehand the full-blown rose of to-morrow; on seeing a\nfine field of corn in which are buried eggs of locusts, we are to foresee that\n~oo<.~l :>\n\f324 Journal Qf Society lor P'gchical Re8earch. [April. 1885.\nthat,corn will never enter the granary i by the appearance of consumptive\nfather and scrofulous mother a sickly child can be foretold. Now all these\ncauses, which bring to us these effects, have in their turn their effects them-\nselves, and so, ad illjinitl,m; and as nothing is lost in Nature, but remains\nimpressed in the akasa., so the acute perception of the seer beginning at the\nsource arrives at the result witli exactitude.\n, TuB NBw ADBPT, COLUMBUS.'\n\"M. Coulomb then described the origin of the letter.\"\nA large beam supported the ceiling, and resting on this, at right angles to\nit, was a series of small beams with SpaceR between them. These spaces were\nfilled with blocks of wood, with mortar to keep them in place. Part of thia\nmortar had been scraped out on the top of the large beam and between two\nsmaller ones, so that a letter could be inserted and lie flat on the top of the\nlarge beam. \"Round the letter was twice passed a piece of thread of the same\ncolour as the ceiling. One end of the thread remained loose on the letter, the\nother end was in the hand of a person outside the room. The thread\nran from the letter, close to the ceiling, passed outside and hung down. I was\nsitting under the main beam. The subject of conversation was led up to,and\nat the given signal (a call to the dog) the confederate in the verandah beyond\npulled the thread and the letter fell. The confederate drew the thread.\nentirely away and left the spot. The crevice for the letter might, in a few\nmoments, have been stopped up and covered with dust, so that no apert~\nwhatever appeared in the neighbourhood of the ceiling.\"\nIt will be remembered by those who have read the First Report of\nthe Committee, that in the introduction to Appendix XXVI. they\nstated that all accounts of letters falling at \"Headquarters\" must, they\nthought, be regarded with suspicion, on account of the construction of the\nIndian ceilings. And though the one in question is somewhat different\nto that which they had in their minds, the narrative just given shows\nthat this suspicion was well founded.\nCopies of the .First Report may still be obtained for 2s. 6d. by\nAssociate~ who have not yet had one, by a.pplying to the Assistant-\nSecretary, 14, Dean's Yard, S.W.\nHAUNTED HOUSE.\nMembers and ABSOOiates desirous of occupying for a time a I!Dlall house\nreputed to be haunted, with a view of investigating the phenomena, are\ninvited to communicate with F.

But the fact that the experience\nwas not mentioned at the time is of course an evidential flaw.\nL.-1554-Ae pn\nFrom Mrs. Beaumont, I, Crescent Road, S. Norwood.\nFebr'l.ul\/1'1J 24tl,. 1885.\nOne day in the 40's, when I was living in the Rectory at Marl-\nborough, my father's house, my mother and sister had gone out. and I\nwas lying on a sofa in the drawing.room, at about 3 p.m. I was\nreading a book. when tbe Hght seemed to be slightly darkened, and\nlooking up I saw, leaning in at the window farthest from me, about\nthree feet from the ground, and beckoning, a gentleman whom I had\nonly seen once, about a fortnight or three weeks previously. Supposing\nthat my father wanted me to sign my name (as a witness to a lease, or\nsomething of that kind) I got up, went out of the window (which led\ndown into the garden), and passed along in front of the house, and up\nsix steps into my father's study, which was empty. I then went into\nthe yard and garden, but found nobody; so I returned to my sofa and\nmy books. When father came in, two hours afterwards, I said. \"Why\ndid you send Mr. H. to call me, and then go away t\" My father replied.\n\"What are you talking about' H. is down in Wales.\" Yothing more\nwas said. I did not like to dwell on\u00b7the subject to eitherof my parents,\nand I did not mention the occurrence to anyone for several years.\nAbout a fortnight afterwards I was told by my mother that Mr. H.\nhad written,' proPOs\\ng for my hand (some property of his\nadjoined some property Df my father's in Wales). I cannot\nfix exactly how close the coincidence was; but my strong im-\npression is that the letter was received within 24 hours of\nmy experience. Bh~re I was told of the contents of the letter, I\nremember that 1 found the blue envelope of Mr. H.'s letter (with\nT. H. on the comer, and with the coat-of-arms on his seal, and with the\npostmark Llandilo) on the ioor in my father's study. When the news\nwas told me, I seemed to receive. some expla.na.tion of my vision.\nI have never had any hallucination or vision at any other time,\n.except when I saw the \"little brown lady\" at Kintbury.*\nC.

About September, 1873, when my father WI!S living at 57, Inverness\nTerrace, I was sitting one evening, about 8.30 p.m., in the large dining-\nroom. At the table, facing me, with their backs to the door, were seated\nmy mother, sister, and a friend, Mrs. W. SuddenlyI seemed to see my\nwife bustling in through the door of the back dining-room, which wn.s in.\nview from my position. She was in a 'I'Il.auve dress. I got up to meet her~\nthough much astonished as I believed her to be at Tenby. As I rose, my\nmother said,\" Whoisthat 1\" not(Ithink)seeing anyone herself,but seeing\ntha.t I did. I exclaimed, \" Why, it's Carry,\"anda.dvancedtomeet her. As\nI advanced, the figure disappeared. On inquiry, I found that my 'fife-\nwas spending that evening at a friend's house, in a mauve dress, which\nI had most certainly never seen. I had never seen her dressed in that\ncolour. My wife recollected that at that time she was talking with\nsome frien'ds about me, much regretting my absence, as there was going'\nto be dancing, and I had promised to play for them. I had been\nunexpectedly detained in London. ALEX. S. BEAUMONT.\nThe following corroboration is from the friend, Mrs. W., who was.\n.present :--\n11, Grosvenor Street, W.\nMarch 5tlt, 1885.\nAs far as I can recollect, Captain Beaumont was sitting talking, when\nhe looked up, and gave a start. His mother asked him what was the-\nmatter. He replied, \"I saw my -:rife walk across the end of the room,\nbut that is nothing, she often appears to people; her servants have seen\nher several times.\" The room we were in was a double dining-room, one-\nend was lit with gas and the other, where Mrs. Beaumont appeared, was,\ncomparatively dark. Noone else saw her except her .husband. Mrs.\n'Beaumont was at the time in Wales, and this happened in Inverness.\nTerrace, Bayswater. FLORENCE WHIPHAli.\nFrom Mrs. Beaumont.\nI distinctly remember hearing from my husband, 'either the next\u00b7\nday or the second day after his experience; and in his letter he asked,\n\" What were you doing at such an hour on such a night 1\" I was a.ble.\nto recall that I was standing in a group of friends, and that we were.\nregretting his absence. I was in a mauve dress, which I am confident.\nthat he could never have seen. . C.

I. had the candle on\nmy right side, and was reading. At the foot of the bed and to th~\nright was a door, which was locked, and, as I learnt l!iterwaros, pas~d\nup \u00b7on the other side. .. .\nThrough this I saw the figure of my future wife (the lady of the\nhouse) enter, draped in white from head to foot. Oddly enough, I was\nnot specially startled. My idea was that some one was ill, and tha.t\nshe had come to get somethin,g out of the room. I averted my head,\nand when I looked up again the apparition was gone. I suppose that I\nsaw it for two or three seconds. ALEX. S. BEAUMONT.\nFrom Mrs. Beaumont.\nFebruary 24tl\" 1885.\nIn 1872, two or three months after my: marriage, Captain Beaumont\nand I returned from London to Tenby. I went up into my dressing-\nroom and gave the keys of my luggage to my servant, Ellen Bassett.\nI was standin,g before the looking-glass with my back turned to her, ana\nI heard her utter a little sharp cry. I turned round, sayin,g, \"What's\nthe matter,\" and saw her with my nightcap in her hand. She said.\n\" 0, nothing, nothing,\" and I went downstairs. The day after my.hu.\nband saw her takin,g oft' the paper w1p.ch pasted up the door between my\nbedroom and the dressing-room. He sa.id, \"What are yon doing 7\"\nShe said she wasopeningthat door. He sa.id, \"Why, the:first nightthatI\nslept in this house, I saw your mistress walk through that door.\" (I must\nexplain that Captain Beaumont had been a guest in this house on a\ngood many occasions before our marriage. On the occasion mentioned,\nhe had imagined that perhaps someone wasill in the house, and that I\nhad entered bis room to get somethin,g, thinkinghim sure to be asleep.)\nThen the maid told him that she had seen me the night before we came\nhome-she did not know exactly what day we were coming, and had\nbeen sleeping in the same bed as he had been in when he saw me. She\nwas just going to step into bed, when she saw tile enter \"through the\ndoor,\" with a nightcap on, and a candle in my hand. She was so\nterrified that she rushed out ofthe room by the other door, and told the\nother servants she was sure I was dead. They comforted her as well\nas they could, but she would :r.ot return to the room. The cause of her\ncrying out, when I heard her do so, was that, in unpackin,g; she\nrecognised the identical nightcap that,the apparition had worn. .The\u00b7\nDigitized by Google\n\f328 Journal of Societ!\/for P8'J\/chicnl Re8earcll. [April,1881i.\ncurious point is that the nightcap was one that I had bought in\nLondon, and had not mentioned to her, and was perfectly unlike any\nthat I had ever wom before. It had three frills. I had been ac>-\ncustomed to wear nightcaps of coloured muslin without frills.\nThe same servant, some months after the nightcap, went into the\nkitchen and said to the other servants, \" We shall have news of missus\nto-day; I've just seen her standing in the dining.room door; she'd on a\nblack velvet bonnet and black cloak.\" (We had been in London some\nweeks.) This occurred about 9 o'clock a.m. About 10.30 she received\na telegram from us to say we should b.! home that evening; the tele-\ngram was sent from Paddington station as we waited for our train.\nThe bonnet and cloak had been bought in town without her knowledge.\nThe maid was with me for years, and was certainly not nervous or\nhystericaL I have now parted with her for some years.\nC.

(Procured\nthrough Miss Porter, who knows the na.rra.tor well.)\nAt.tg'IUt, 1884.\nIn October, 1883, being in Toronto, Canada, at the time, I thought\nI saw my youngest sister come into the ante\u00b7room next to the room\nwhere we were seated at lunch. I exclaimed, and then thought I had\nbeen mistaken, of course, and that one of my cousins who resembled her\nsolJlewhat in appearance had come to lunch, but found no one was there\nat all, nor had anyone come into the room. I remember remarking a.t\nthe time that I thought I saw my sister all in brown, and that she\nhad nothing of that colour as far as I knew. A few days afterwards I\nreceived a letter from another sister, in which she mentioned that my\nyoungest sister and she had been getting new winter things, and were\ndressed in brown from head to foot.\nI think I was quite well at the time, but my sister was ill, which I\n.was not aware of for some weeks afterwards.\nE. M. CHUBCIIILL.\nIt is rarely that the cases of the AD PD type (Agent normal-\nPercipient normal) can be regarded as evidence of telepathy. There\n\u00b7being no perceptible coincidence, the phantasm may alwa.ys be regarded\nas a purely subjective hallucination. In the foregoing cases the dreu is\nthe point which affords a. certain presumption in favour of telepathy.\nIn the next case, a similar presumption is afforded by the fact that the\nphantasm was seen by two people, one of ,.,hom had never seen the\nsupposed agent, and yet correctly described his appearance.\nDigitized by Google\n\fApril, 1885.] Journal of 80cietyfor P81Jckical Research. ,329\nL-1557-AU pa\nFrom Mrs. Elgee, 18, Woburn Road, Bedford.\nHarcl, 1st, 1885.\nIn the month pf November, 1864, being detained in Cairo, on my\nway out to India, the following curious circumstance occurred to me :-\nOwing to an unusual in1lux of travellers, I, with the young ,lady under\nmy charge (whom we will call D.) and some other passengers of the\noutward-bound mail to India, had to take up our abode in a somewhat\n.nfrequented hotel The room shared by Miss D. and myself was large,\nlofty, and gloomy; the furniture of the scantiest, consisting of two small\nbeds, placed nearly in the middle of the room and not touching the\nwalls at all; two or three rush-bottomed chairs, a very small washing-\nstand, and a large old-fashioned sofa. of the settee sort, which was\nplaced against .one-half of the large folding-doors which gave entrance\nto the room. This settee was far too heavy to be removed, unless by\ntwo or three people. The other half of the door was used for entrance,\nand faced the two beds. Feeling rather desolate and strange, and MissD.\nbeing a nervous person, I locked the door, and taking out the key, put it\nunder my pillow; but on Miss D. remarking that there might be' a\nduplicate which could open the door from outside, I put a chair a.gainst\nthe door, with my travelling-bag on it, so arranged, that on any\npressure outside one or both must fall on the bare floor, and make noise\nenough to rouse me. We then proceeded to retire to bed, the one I\nhad chosen being near the only window in the room, which opened with\ntwo glazed doors, al.ruost to the floor. These doors, on account of the\nheat, I left open, first assuring myself that no communication from the\noutside could be obtained. (The window led on to a smaU balcony,\nwhich wasisolated, and was three stories above the ground.) I suddenly\nwoke from a sound sleep with the impression that somebody had ca1lef;l\nme, and, sitting up in bed, to my unbounded astonishment, by the clear\nlight of early dawn coming in through the large window before-\nmentioned, I beheld the figure of an old and very valued friend whom\nI knew to be in England. He appeared as if most eager to speak to\nme, and I addressed him with, \"Good gracious! how did you come\nhere ~ \" So clear was the figure, that I noted every detail of his dress,\neven to three onyx shirt studs which he always wore. He seemed to\ncome a step nearer to me, when b\"l suddenly pointed acroES the room,\nand on my looking round, I saw Miss D. sitting up in her bed, gazing at\nthe figure with every expression of terror. On looking back, my friend\nseemed to shake his head, and retreated, step by step, slowly, till he\nseemed to sink through that portion of the door where the settee stood.\nI never knew whathappened to me after this ;but my next remembrance\nis of bright sunshine pouring through the window. Gradually the\nDigitized by Google\n\f330 Jourllai of Society for, P8ychical Re8eara,. [April,1885.\nremembrance of what had happened came ba.ckto me; and the question\narose in my mind, had I been dreaming, or had I seen a visitant from\nanother world 1the bodily presence of my friend being utterly impossible.\nRemembering that Miss D. had seemed aware of the figure as well as\nmyself, I determined to allow the test of my dream or vision to be\nwhatever she said to me upon the subject, I intending to say nothing\nto her unless she spoke to me. As she seemed still asleep, I got out of\nbed, examined the door carefully, and found the chair and my bag\nuntouched, and the key under my pillow; the settee had not been\ntouched, nor had that portion of the door against which it was placed\nany appearance of being opened for years. Presently, on Miss D.\nwaking up, she looked about the room, and noticing the chair and ba.g~\nmade some remark as to their not haling been much use. I said~\n\"What do ypu mean 1\" and when she said, \"Why, that man who was\nin the room. this morning must have got in somehow.\" She then\nproceeded to describe to me exactly what I myself had seen. Without\ngiving any satisfactory answer as to what I had seen, I made her rather\nangry by affecting to treat the matter &.II a. fancy on her part, and\nshowed her the key still under my pillow, and the chair and bag\nuntouched. I then asked her, if she was so sure that sbe had seen\nsomebody in the room, did not she know who it was f \" No,\" said she,\n\"I have never seen him before, nor anyone like him.\" I\nsaid, \"Have you ever seen a photograph of him 1\" She said,\n\"No.\" This lady never was told what I saw, and yot\ndescribed exactly to a third person what we both had seen.\nOf course I was under the impression my friend was dead. Such,\nhowever, was not the case; and I met him some four years later,\nwhen, without telling him anything of my experience in Oairo, I asked\nhim in a jokingway could he remember what he was doing on a certain\nnight in November. 1864. \"Well,\"he said, \"you require me to have\na good memory\" ; but after a little reflection he replied. \"Why that\nwas the time I was so harassed with trying to decide for or d.g&inst\nthe appointment which was offered me, and I so much wished you\ncould have been with me to talk the matter over. I sat over the fire\nquite late, trying to think what you would have advised me to do.\"\nA little cross-questioning and comparing of dates brought out the\ncurious fact that, allowing for the difference of time between England\nand Oairo, his meditations over the fire and my experience were\nsimultaneous. Having told him the circumstances above narrated, I\nasked him had he been aware of any peculiar or unusua.lsensation. He\nsaid none, only that he had wanted to see me very much.\nE. H.

I put them into the following form after receiving them, and\nItave no doubt of their substance and details being exactly given. The\nevents related had occurred about four years previously to Mr. Fowler's\ninterview with Mr. Clarke. .\nllr.

Mr. C. said to\nher, \"Oh, it's all nonsense, I don't believe anything of the sort.\" She\n\u00b7earnestly persisted in her conviction, and called on Mr. C. perhaps half\u2022\n.a-dozen times during the ensuing week. In order to pacify her, he\nundertook to write to the agent of her son's ship at New York. This\nahe had wished him to do, thinking that he, as a business man, would\n.know better how to write than herself. After the dellpatch of the letter,\nMrs. P. kept ca.lling on Mr. C. about every week to ask if he had heard\nanything. In about a month's time a letter arrived from New York,\naddressed to \" MrS.

The night specified was that of Mrs. P.'s.\nvision.\nMr. Clarke described Mrs. Palliser as \"a well-educated woman, a\nvery respectable old lady who had seen better days,\" about 65 years of\n.age.

They lived in a small village a.t Treylion, near\nSt. Ives, Cornwall. Now what I am going to relate is about their\n-daughter Betsy, who had taken a situation-I think at St. Ives.

Aunt said, \"Betsy, where have you\n-come from 1\" The weather being frightfully bad, she thought she had\n~alked home through the wet. She told her to go and dry herself, but\n,she vanished away. Poor aunt was dreadfully alarmed.

Ifthe per~\ncipient's experience had been confined to the moaning heard in the night,\nthe incident would not have been worth attending to, as odd sounds at\nnight are very common phenomena, and may be accounted for by quite\nnormal causes.

We had no\nknowledge of Mrs. B.'s illness at the time my husband heard the\nnoise.\nMy husband's parents had been obliged to leave D. Hall under\npainful circumstances, and possibly the thoughts of her loved home ll1ay\nhave been paramount with Mrs. B., or it may have been that they Hew\nto my husband, who was her youngest son. At any rate, my husband\nalways held that it was his mother's moaning he heard at D. Hall\nthough she was in France. She was speechless when he reached her.\nao no solution could be arrived at. E. A.

He returned to Selhurst.\nwhere we were living, and where I was, on hiB way to Dieppe, and then\ntold me about this noise. On his return from Dieppe, after his mother's\ndeath, he said, \"You remember my telling you of the moaning I haard\nat D-,--. The first sound I heard in the house at Dieppe was\nthe same, and it was my mother making it.\" He further added that\nhe was told she had made it for a day or two. I am pt'rfectly clear\nabout his hearing it first at night in the house, and on the following\nmorning in the shrubberies, which were a. little distance from the\nhouse. I never heard either my husband or his father speak of ever\nhearing sounds, or seeing anything befo~ or after the occurrences I have\nmentioned.

The scope of possible dreams is so indefinitely\nlarge as to prevent here any definite confutation of the argument that\nthe ~orrespondences and coincidences which\"have been noted have been\naccidental. At the same time, if telepathy be proved by the stronger\ncases, where the percipient is awake, there is evel'Y reason to suppose\nthat other cases might also occur in sleep. For there is nothing in the\ncondition of sleep which we have any ground for supposing adver8e to\nthe telepathic influence.

His reply to this letter was that the\ngreat distance, nearly 300 miles, precluded any possibility of their\nmeeting, as the journey should nearly altogether be accomplished on\nfoot, and that he preferred staying in the neighbourhood of Sydney, &c.,\n&c.

This dream or vision made so deep and lasting\nan impression that! constantly alluded to it to members of our house-\nhold, until circumstances occasioned my calling on Mrs. Goodall about.\nthe beginning of this month, March, 1885, when I made particular\ninquiries for her daughter; and on being assured that she was well,\naccording to letters by the most recent mail, I ventured to express my\ngratifiration, giving,as my reason for such, a. narration of the \"vision'~\nthat had not even then ceased to haunt me; which elicited from Mrs.\nGoodall and both of her daughters, who were present, fervent hopes.\nthat all was well with Mrs. Seymour.

It-\nwas in June, 1869, when I was residing in Paris j my son was at the-\nImperial College de Vanves, near Paris. I saw him in my dream with his.\neyes so red and inflamed that I thoughii to apply a bandage over them.\nI was much troubled, so much so that it left a great impression all the.\nnext day on my mind. In the afternoon of that day I received intima-\ntion that my son was ill, and went to the college, and found him exactly-\nas I had seen him in my dream, but did not remember seeing-\nthe surroundings in the room. I spoke of it to my family the next.\nmorning. The only surviving member now is a brother who lesides in\nParis, who well remembers my dream. I will forward your letter to\nhim, and ask him to write to you. As you asked if this was the\nmost vivid dream I had had, I must mention one 1 had many years.\nbefore my marriage (I unfortunately cannot give you the date) relative\nto a very dear lady- friend I had not seen for several months. I was.\nresiding in Paris, and I knew her to be in England, but I had not heard\n,of her for a long time. I told my family my dream (as I was much im-\npressed by it), that I saw her dressed in a peculiar fur tippet, with\nmuff, white, with black spots, (I had never seen her with it), and\nthat she would look in upon us all while at dinner,and to surprilile us the\nmore,would enter quietly by a back door. It came to pass as I had saidjall\nmy relations were so startled at the time that for a few momentS they\nhad not a word for this dear friend,who,in return,was rather surprised,as.\nyou may imagine-they all so well remembered my statement that I had.\ngiven that day in the morning.

He was in the service of the East India.\nCompany-an officer in the 8th Native Infantry. I had always been\n-devoted to him, and I grieved and fretted far more than any of my\nelderS knew at his danger. I cannot say I dreamt constantly of him,\nbut when I did the impressions were vivid and abiding.\nOn one occ~on his personaJ appearance was being discussed, and I\nremarked, \"He is not like that now, he has no beard nor whiskers,'~\nand when asked why I said such a thing I replied, \"I knew it, for I\nhad seen him in my dreams,\" and this brought a severe reprimand from\nmy governess, who never allowed\" such nonsense\" to be talked of.\nOn the morning of the 25th September, quite early, I awoke from\na dream to find my sister holding me, and much alarmed. I had\nscreamed out, struggled, crying out, \"Is he really dead 7\" When I\nfu1ly awoke I felt a burning sensation in my head. I could not speak:\nfor a moment or two j I knew my sister was there, but I neither felt nor\nsaw her.\nInahout a minute, during which she said my eyes were staring\nbeyond her, I ceased struggling, cried out, \"Harry's dead, they have\nshot\u00b7 him,\" and fainted.\nWhen I recovered I found my sister had been sent away, and an\naunt who had always (on account of my mother's health) looked after\nme, sitting by my bed.\nIn order to soothe my exciteml'nt she allowed me to tell her my\ndream, trying all the time to persuade me to regard it as a natural\nconsequence of my anxiety. When in the narration I said he was\nriding with another officer, and mounted soldiers behind them, she ex-\n<lwmed, \"My dear, that shows you it is only a dream, for you know\ndear Harry is in an infantry, not a cavalry, regiment.\" !iothing, how-\never, shook my feelings that I had seen a reality, and she was so much\nstruck by my persistence, that she privately made notes of the date,\nand of the inciden~ even to the minutest details of my dream, and then\nfor a few days the matter dropped, but 1 felt the truth was coming\nnearer and nearer to all. In a short time the news came in the papers-\nshot down on the morning of the 25th when on his way to Lucknow. A\nfew days later came one of his missing letters, telling how his own,\nregiment had mutinied, and that he had been transferred to a command\nin the 12th Irregular Cavalry, hound to join Havelock's force in the\nrelief of Lucknow.\nSome eight years after the officer who was riding by him when he\nDigitized by Google\n\fApril,1885.] Jo-urnalof Society for P8l\/chical Re8earch. 353\nfell, visited us, and when, in compliance, with my aunt's request, he de-\ntailed the incidents of that sad hour his narration tallied (even to the-\ndescription of the buildings on their left) with the notes she had taken\u00b7.\nthe morning of my dream.\nI should also add that we hQlU'd he had made an alteration in hi&\nbeard and whiskers just about the time that I had spoken of him as:\nwearing them differently.\nIn answer to inquiries Miss W. says :- JanUQiry 31st, 1885.\nAs to date, the dream concerning my brother's death took place in.\nthe morning half of the night of the 25th of September, and I think I\nnoted in my MS. that an aunt to whom I related the dream at the\ntime was so struck by the' pertinacity with which I adhered to the\nvarious particulars, that she put down the date and also the details of\"\nthe dream. .\nMy brother's rank was that of captain.

Sometimes I went a week with-\nout one of these peculiar visitations; sometimes they came night after\nnight; and on one occasion I was nearly four months free from them.\nI could neither attribute them to anyone particular course of study,\nnor to indigestion, nor to any special diet, for I tried change in every\nway for my own comfort's sake. I was not in love, nor indeed had I\nbeen ; and certainly no feeling but that of a mysterious repugnance (and\nat the same time all inability to avoid or escape from the influence of the\nperson of whom I dreamt) actuated me. He was someone I had never\nin all my life wittingly seen, though I had reason to think afterwards\nthat he had seen me at a Birmingham musicaJ. festival. On that\noccasion I had apparently fainted, and it was attribu~d to the heat\nand the excitement of the music. I hardly knew if it were or not. I\nonly knt'w I felt all my pulses stop, and a burning and singing in my\nhead, and that I was perfectly conscious of those around me, but unable\nto speak and tell them so. To return to my dreams. I always knew\nas I slept when the influence was coming over me, and often in my\ndream I commenced it by thinking, \"Here it is, or here he comes\nagain.\" They were not always disagreeable dreams in themselves, but\nthe fascination was always dreadful to me, and a kind of struggle\nbetween two natures within me seemed to drag my powers of mind and\nbody two ways. I used to awake as cold as a stone in the hottest nights,\nmy head having the queer feeling of a hot iron pressing somewhere in\nits inside. I would shiver and my teeth chatt.er with a terror which\nseemed unreasonable, for there was, even in the subjects of my dreams,\naeldom anything wicked or terrifying. .AB to any idea of love between\nme and this mysterious\u00b7stranger, there never was any approach to it\nin my impressions. There was an interval when a gentleman was\npaying me some little at1;en~on. in my day life, that the irrita.bility of\nmy tormentor seemed in my dreams to be extreme.

If I could have\nspoken I would have said,\" My dreams 1my dreams 1\" but I only\n;shivered, which attracted the notice of my companion, who exclaimed,\n\" You are ill, my dear. Come for some wine, or hot coffee.\" I rose,\nknowing what I was going to see, and as I turned, I looked straight into\nthe eyes of the fac-simile of the being who had been present to my\n:sleeping thoughts for so long, and the next instant he stepped forward\n-from the pillar against which he was leaning behind the lace curtain\n.and shook hands with my companion. He accompanied us to the re-\nireshment room, attended to my wants, and was introduced to me. I\n.declined dancing, but could not avoid conversation. His first remark\nwas, \"We are not strangers to each other. Where have we met 7,\" I\nfear I shall scarcely be believed when I say, that (setting my teeth and\n-nerving myself to meet what I felt would conquer me, if I once sub-\niilitted in even the slightest degree) I answered that I never remem-\nberedmeeting him before, and to all his questionings returned the most\nreserved answers. He seemed much annoyed and puzzled, but on that\n()ccasion did not mention dreams. I took an opportunity of asking my\n.sister if she remembered my description of the man of my dreams, and\nupon her answering\" Yes,\" asked her to look round the rooms and ,see\nif anyone there resembled him, and half-an-hour later she came up,\n.saying, \"There is the man, he has even the mole on the )eft side of his\nmouth.\"\nWe made inquiries cautiously as to who the gentleman was, and\n:heard that he came from -the United States, had letters of recom-\nmendation to some of the first families in Liverpool society, was sup-\nposed to be half English, half German, very peculiar in his notions,\nvery studious, very fascinating when he chose to be so.

He frequently asked if I believed in dreams; if I could\nYelate any to him ; if I had never seen him before; and would say, after\nmy persistent avoidance of the subject, \"I can do nothQlg, so long as\n:you will not trwt me.\" ,\nOur friends thought there was a flirtation going on, but on neither\nside was there anything approaching it.

G. GWYNNB.\nL.-1678-Ad pn\nFrom the Rev. John Mathwin, Vicar of West Pelton, Co. Durham.\n_ D6C6mher 19th, 1884.\nForty years ago, or thereabouts, when I was a~ut 20 years of'\nage, a lady friend of mine, a distant relative by marriage--age between.\n40 and 50-had for some time been in a delicate state of health, though.\n.not confined to the house. We frequently had quiet conversation&.\ntogether on religious matters. Neither of us was of an excitable turn\nof mind. The invalid herself waa happy, and I felt .a calm and\ncomforting conviction of the truth of Christianity. As well as I can.\nnow recollect I last saw my friend alive about a fortnight before\nher death. She did not seem at that time to be worse than usual, and\napparently might have lived at any ra.te for a few years. However, one\u00b7\nnight when I was in bed-say about 4 o'clock in the morning-I\nhad what I may call a vision. A figure appeared before me neatly\ndraped, and a certain brightness about it seemed to awake me. I at..\nonce felt conscious that someone was near me who wished to make\na communication to me. I soon recognised the face of my invalid.\nfriend. She seemed to wish to give me time to collect myself-\nevidently intimating that there was no cause why I should be afraid~\nAs a matter of fact I had no fear at all. My then feelings may perhapb.\nbe best described as partaking both of wonder (or expectation) and\npleasure. When, apparently, the figure had convinced herself that I\nrecognised her, and that I had satisfied myself that I was under no\ndelusion, she seemed to beckon me cheeringly with one or two fingers.\nof her right hand, and to say to me, \"It's all right; come on.\" She-\nthen vanished, and I neither saw nor heard anything more.\nThough there was no injunction given to me not to tell what I had\nseen, I yet felt that the communication was of too solemn a nature to\nallow me at once to talk of it openly. But I said to my brother at..\nbreakfast about 8 o'clock that morning that I had dreamt in the night.\nthat Mrs. So-and-so was dead, and it turned out, as we heard abouiA.\nDigitized by Google\n\f.364 Jourtllli Qf Societyfor P8ychical Ruearck. [April, 188.').\n10 o'clock, that our friend had died during the night. For some years\nI never mentioned this experience to anyone, but afterwards I felt\nno hesitation in talking about it to intimate friends.\nIn answer to inquiries Mr. Mathwin says:-\nFebruary 17t1&, 1885.\nTo my brother I spoke of what I call the vision as if it had been So\n.cJream, but this was because I did not wish to draw his attention very\nspecially to it, although I felt constrained to mention it to him in BOme\nway.\nHe tells me now that he has no recollection of my having spoken\nto him about it, as I did at breakfast on the morning of the death, but\nbefore we knew of the death having taken place. I am not, however,\nsurprised that my brother should not now recollect the remark I made\nto him at that time.\n'Myown strong impresaion all along has been, and still is, that I was\n-communicated with by the spirit of the departed. I, therefore, infer\nthat in reference to that special communication I was to all intents and\npurposes awake. I never had any similar experience before, neither\nhave I had since..1 had no reason to expect any communication of the\n.kind at any time.\nJOHN MATHWIN.\nThe following is a rather strong specimen of a weak class. It is\n-an account of a very unusual depression of spirits, followed by a vivid\ndream. The latter may easily be accounted for as following naturally\non the former. The emotional depression, which coincided in time with\n\u00b7the death of a near relative, may, of course, have been accidenta.1; but\nit seems to have been a unique experience in the life of a person of\n-strong menta.1 and physical health, which is in favour of the telepathic\n'explanation.\nL.-1579-Ad pn\nFrom a doctor, who does not wish his name to be published.

I was engaged in the cricket match~\nI saw a telegram being brought to me while batting, and it told me,\nthat my father was dying, and telling me to come home at once.

I saw a telegram\nbeing brought out, read it, and fainted. I at once left for home, and\nfound my father had just died when I reached the house. The ulcer in\nthe stomach had suddenly burst about 4 o'clock on the pnnious day,\nand it was about that hour that I had experienced the most unusual\ndepression I have described. The sensations I had on that afternoon\nhave left a most clear and distinct impression on my mind, and now,\nafter the lapse of 15 years, I well remember my miserable feelings.\nJ.D.,M.D.\nIn reply to inquiries, Dr. D. says :-\nI most certainly never had a similar experience of depression, or-\nsuch a vivid dream as the one I tried in my letter to explain.

TAGUET'S PATIENT AT BORDEAUX.\nTo the Editor 0\/ the \"JOUBNAL OJ' TUB SOCIBTY FOB PsYCBICAL RBsBABCH.' ..\nSm,-In an article in Part vn. of the Pf'OCUdit&g8 of the Society for\nPaychical Research (p. 219) reference is made to an observation of M. Taguet-\non a patient under his care in the .Arile del .AlUtu!e&, in Bordeaux, by name-\nNodlie X., which is recorded in the .Anflalea Mid~u, 1884,\np. 325. She is about 24 years of age, and has been treated as insane\nfor lOme time, but her symptoms are variable, and every noW' and\nthen in an nccAB she has shown lOme remarkable capacities, and among them\nwhat is termed by M. Taguet a \"hypeneetheaia of Bight.It She will sit at\nsuch times facing a dull, blank wall with her eyes shut and her eyeballs\napparently upturned in the fashion that often obtains in hysterical, mesmeric\nand other neurotic states; and in this condition, according to M. Taguet'.\ndescription, can read apparently on the blank wall or on a sheet of blank\ncardboard held in front of her face the print, both small and large, of a\nnewspaper held up behind the back of her head, which one could only expect\nher to see if the blank wall or cardboard were a mirror, or if her eyes were\nin the back ofher head. \"Now, Dr. Taguet,\" says Mr.F.W. H. Myers, in the-\nabove-mentioned article, \"does not attempt to explain this, further than by\ncalling it hypeneathesia of vision. But he can hardly mean that she really\nsaw the worda reflected in tbe cardboard. Perhaps the only other IOlution\nwhich suggested itself to him was that she saw the worda clairvoyantly, and\nthis solution he did not like to adopt. And there is, in fact, no reason, as\n~e facta are reported, for aaauming clairvoyance. Thought-tranaference\nwould amply suffice to explain the phenomena.II Of course, to render an\nexplanation by thought-transference poaaible, it must first be ascertained\nthat the worda read by Noelie were previously known to lOme one present.\nWhether this was 80 or not is not mentioned in M. Taguet's article. I wrote-\nto him, and he very kindly sent me a reprint of his article, but I could learn.\nnothing further on this particular point. I ventured to propose a visit, but..\nunfortunately when I reached the Arile du .AliiMllI I found he was not\nin Bordeaux for that day. His aaa istant moat courteously introduced me to\nthe patient, NOlflie X., with whom I talked a little. She was in fairly good\nhealth and good spirita, and her symptoms of mental derangement quite in\nabeyance. Thore was no sign of the abnormal capacities peculiar to the-\naccU, and no attempt at an experiment was therefore made. M. Taguet'.\naaaistant had been present on some previous occasions when the \"hyperma-\nthesia of sight\" had been noticed, and did not seem confident of any\nexplanation. I believe I may say that I made the thought-reading hypothesis>\nintelligible to him, but he_\nwas able at once to aaaure me that no one in the\nroom could have been aware what were the words in the newspaper that was\npresented to tbe back of Noelio's head until they were looked at to confirm\nNoeIie's reading; so that, in fact, he negatived the necesaary foundation for-\na theory of thought-transference. I do not think such a theory had\noccurred to the experimenters, and I am not sure that their attention had\nbeen closely giyen to the point in question. I wrote again later to M.\nTaguet, asking him to remark it in any future experimenta.-I am yours.\nfaithfully, '\nA. T. MYBBS, M.D.\nDigitized by Google\n\f","_id":408}
