The Englifli nation\nhas too much curiofity for every\nthing that occupies the neighbour\nkingdom, from whom we have long\niince been ufed to receive the laws of\npolitenefs and etiquette,and who have\nlately feemed to take the lead of us in\nphilofophical difcovery, for the pre-\nfent tranflation not to prove an ac\u00ad\nceptable prefent to alarge and refpec-\nA % table\n\f[ > ]\ntable clafs of our countrymen. It has\nbeen thought proper, in order that the\nmoft uninformed reader may find in\nthis little compilation, every fpecies of\ninformation upon the fubje\u00a3t? to pre\u00ad\nfix to it a brief account of the pro-*\ngrefs of this fyftem.\nM. Mefmer, the inventor of the.\nanimal magnetifm, is a German phy-*\niician. The firft thing by which\nhe diftinguifhed himfelf, appears tp\nhave been the publication of a Dif~\nfertation upon the Influence of the\nStars on the Human Body, printed at\nVienna 1766;, and publicly defended\nby him as a thefis in that univerfity.\nIn 1774 father Hehl, a Gerqian phi-\nlofopher, ftrongly recommended the\nufe of the loadftone in the art of me\u00ad\ndicine. M. Mefmer became very\nearly a convert to the principles of\nthis writer, and actually carried them\ninto practice with diftinguifhed fuc-\ncefs. In the midft however of his\nattention to the utility of the load-\nftqne?\n\fjftone, he was led to the adoption of\na new fet of principles, which he con\u00ad\nceived to be much more general in\ntheir application and importance. In\nconformity to thefe principles he laid\nalide the ufe of the loadftone, and\nproceededwithhis cures in themethod\nwhich he afterwards publiihed to the\nworld. This apoftacy involved him\nin a quarrel with father Hehl and the\ncelebrated Ingenhouz, by whom he\nhad formerly been patronized; and\nas their credit in Viennawasextremely\nJ\nhigh, and their exertions againft him\nindefatigable, his fyftem almoft im\u00ad\nmediately funk into general difrepute.\nTo parry their oppofition he appeal1-\ned in 1776 to the academy of fciences\nat Berlin. Here however his prin\u00ad\nciples were rejected as \" deftitute of\nfoundation and unworthy the fmalleft\nattention.\" Undifmayed by thefe\nimportant mifcarriages, he made a\nprogrefs through feveral. towns of\nGermany, ftill pradtifing the methods\nA 3 of\n\ff VI 1\nof the animal magnetifm, and from\ntime to time publifhing an account of\nthe cures he effe\u00a3ted^ which did not\nfail to be followed by a detectionfrom\nhis enemies. In the mean time, re-\nfclved, as it fhould feem, if poflible\nnot to deprive his country of the be\u00ad\nnefits of lb valuable a difcovery, he\nreturned a fecond time to Vienna, and\nmade another effay with no greater\nfuccefs than the former.\nDecided in his conduct by thefe\nuninterrupted defeats,heleftGermany\nand arrived at Paris in the beginning;\nof the year 1778. Here one of the\nfirll connexions he formed was with\nM. A. J. S. D., author of the Di\u00a3ti-\nonnaire des Merveilles de la Nature,,\nfrom which work many of the fol\u00ad\nlowing particulars are extracted. It\nis obferved by this writer, that \" in\nfpite of the apparent cautioufnefs an$\nreferve of M. Mefmer, and even in\nfpite of the little fuccefs of his firft\nexperiments, he could not refufe him\ncredit\n\f[ vii 1\ncredit for fincerity in his conduct, and\nfolidity in his reafonings; and he was\nconvinced, that the failure did not\noriginate in the fault of his agent>\nbut the indilpoiitiori of the fubjedls\n\\ipon which it was employed.\" In\nApril 1778, M. Mefmer Retired to\nGreteil with the patients he had col\u00ad\nlected, and ill a few months almoftall\nof therri returned to Paris perfectly\nreftored. One of them in particular\nWas a paralytic^ deprived of the ufe\nof her limbs, and who now walked\nwith all the eafe arid firmnefs in the\nWorld. Irl November M. A. J. S. D.\nintroduced M. Mefmer to the houfe\nof a family of diftindtiori, and who\nWere actuated with the extremeft\ncuridfity refpefling all difcoveries\nWhich had the benefit of humanity\nfor their obje\u00a3t. Here he made an\nexperiment fo remarkable that it is\nneceflary to extra<5t it fomewhat at\nlength.\nA 4 \" There-\n\f[ viii 1\n<c There being a pretty numerous\nCompany in the faloon, M. Mefmer\ntouched fucceffively feveral perfons,\nfome of'whom had nerves extremely\nirritable, without producing any ef\u00ad\nfect fufficiently conflderable todeferve\nto be afcribed to the animal magne-*\ntifm. The operation was, repeated;\nthe fuccefs was the fame.\n\" The governor of the children\nof the family, a man of a very robuft\nand mufcular conftitution, little in\u00ad\nclined to credulity, and fortified iii\nhis fcepticifm by what he ha,d juft\nfeen, had complained for fome time\nof a pain in his ihoulders. As he\nwas beyond difpute the leaft fufcep-\ntibie pei;fori in the company, he pro-\npofed himfelf by way of gafconade\n\u2022for the fubjedl of a laffc experiment.\n\" M. Mefmer refufed to touch\nthis gentleman, but confented to di\u00ad\nrect upon him the magnetifm from\na fmall difiance. In compliance with\nthe doctor's inclinations, the governor\nturned\n\ft - ix. ]\nturned his back, and M. Mefmer,\nfeven or eight feet from his fubjedt,\nprefented his finger. This continued\nfor two minutes, the governor reply\u00ad\ning to the repeated queftions of the\ndo&or with much humour and irony.\nM. Mefmer then nodded his head fig-\nnificantly to the company, and in the\nmean time guided his finger upwards*\ndownwards, and a little circularly.\nThe patient faid that he felt a kind\nof fhuddering in the fuperior part of\nthe back; he however afcribed it to\nthe adtion of the fire near which he\nflood, and accordingly removed ta\nanother part of the room. The ex\u00ad\nperiment was refumed, the fenfation\naugmented, and the patient faid he\ncould compare it to nothing better,\nthan a ftream of boiling water, cir\u00ad\nculating in the veins of his back an<^\nfhoulders. The impreffion became\nlo ftrong that he refufed to fubmit to\nthe experiment any longer. He was\nperfuaded however; the mailer of the\nhoufe\n\ft X ]\nhoufe held one of his arms, arid My*\nfelf the other. In the procefs of the\nexperiment the heat became fo in-\nfupportable, that he violently broke\naway from our grafp* It was fuc-\nceeded by a profufe perfpiration in\nthe part affedted.\n\" M. Mefmer then placed the fore\u00ad\nfinger of each hand upon the cheft\nof the patient. The fame ieniation,\nbut lefs violent, was produced in this\npart; itafcended gradually to the face*\nand was fucceeded by a perfpiration\nof the forehead. The patient then\nprefented his forefingers and thumbs,\nthe reft of his hand being clenched;\nM. Mefmer did the fame very Hear to\nthe patient, but without touching\nhim. He complained lucCeflively of\na fhuddering, itching and ftiffnefs id.\nthe palms of his hands; thefe Were\nagain fucceeded by a local perfpira\u00ad\ntion.\"\nTo this remarkable experiment we\nwill beg leave to add the following\nfrom\n\fC xx\" 1\nfrom the Journal de Paris, No. 449\n1 7 8 4 .\n\" M. Mefmer being one day with\nmeffieurs Camp and d'E -\u2014-\nnear the great canal at Meudon, pro-\npofed to them to go alternately to the\nother iide of the canal, while he re\u00ad\nmained where he was. He then di\u00ad\nrected them to tliruft their cane into\nthe water, in the mean time doing\nthe fame himfelf. At this diftance\nM. Camp was feized with a fit\nof the afthma, and M. d'E \u2014 with\na pain in the liver to which he was\nfubje<5t. Many perfons have been\nunable to fubmit to this experiment\nwithout fainting away.''\n\" One evening M. Mefmer walked\nwith lix perfons in the gardens of the\nprince de Soubife. He performed the\nmagnetical operation upon a tree, and\na little time after three ladies of the\ncompany fainted away. The duchefs\nde C , the only remaining lady,\nfupported herfelf upon the tree, with\u00ad\nout\n\ft xii ]\nout being able to quit it. The count\ntie Monf \u2014-\u2014, unable to ftand, was\nobliged to throwhimfelf upon abench.\nThe effe&supon M. Ang \u2014, a gen\u00ad\ntleman of a very mufcular frame,\nwere more terrible. M. Mefmer's\nfervant, who was fummoned to re\u00ad\nmove the bodies, and who was inured\nto thefe fcenes, found himfelf un\u00ad\nable to move. The whole company\nwere obliged to remain in this iitua-\ntion for a confiderable time.\" Thefe\ninftances are cited by ,M. Thouret,\nRecherches 8c Doutes, p. 65.\nM. Mefmer was from the firft de-\nflrous of fubmitting his fyftem to the\nexamination of the faculty of medi\u00ad\ncine; but he would not fubmit to a\nregular and authentic committee ap\u00ad\npointed for that purpofe, apprehen-:\nlive as he faid of the baleful ef\u00ad\nfects of the fpirit of fociety. This\nexception occafioned a mifunder-\nftanding between him and the faculty)\nand the examination was never made.\nIn\n\fIn France the fuccefs of M.Mefmer\nwas the reverfe of what it had been\nin Germany. His patients increafed\nrapidly. His cures were numerous\nand of the moft aftonilhing nature.\nHe was obliged to form a number of\npupils under his infpe&ion to ad-\nminifter his procefs. In 1779 he\npublifhed a Memoir refpeiting the\nDifcovery of the Animal Magnetifm,\nand promifed a complete fyftem upon\nthe fubje\u00a3t, which fhould make as\ngreat a revolution in philofophy, as it\nhad already done in medicine. Struck\nwith the clearnefs and accuracy of his\nreafonings, the magnificence of his\npreteniions, and the extraordinary and\nunqtieftionable cures he performed,\nfome of the greateft phyiicians and\nmoft enlightened philofophers of\nFrance became his converts. Among\nthefe M. Court de Gebelin particu\u00ad\nlarly diftinguifhed himfelf, a writer,\nwho had attained the higheft\nreputation by his refearches into an\u00ad\ntiquity,\n\fC xiv ]\ntxquity, and who was, if poflible,\nftill more diftinguifhed for the ele\u00ad\ngance of his tafte, the beauty of his\nconceptions' and the richnefs of his\nfancy. The houfe of M. Mefmer at\nCreteil was crowded with patients,\nA numerous company was daily afr\nfembled at his houfe at Paris, where\nthe operationwas publicly performed;\nand M. Deflon, one of his pupils, is\nfaid to have cleared \u00a3100,000. He\nwas patronifed by people of the firfl\nrank, and, as M. Thouret obferves,\nthe 1 animal magnetifm became a\nmode, an affair of bon ton, an\nintereit, extremely precious and\nwarmly efpoufed by the fafliionable\nworld.\nIn the mean time the new fyftem\nwas by no means deftitute of enemies.\nSome of the firft pens in France were\ndrawn to oppofe it, and among others\nthat of M. Thouret, regent-phyficiai)\npf the faculty. The faculty indeed\nhad all along beheld its progrefs with\nthe\n\fthe extremeft jealoufy. At length\njt was thought to deferve the atten-r\ntion of government, and a committee,\npartly phyficians, and partly members\nof the royal academyof fciences, with\ndodtor Benjamin Franklin at their\nhead, were appointed to examine it,\nM. Mefmer refufed to have any com\u00ad\nmunication with thefe gentlemen;\nfrut M. Deflon, the moft confiderable\nof his pupils, confented to difclofe to\nthem his principles, and aflift them\nin their enquiries. Their Report forms\nthe principal piece in the enfuing\npamphlet. M. Mefmer however has\nappealed from their decifion to the\nparliament of Paris.\nIn the mean time it can no longer\nbe concealed that the fyftem of the\nanimal magnetifm is to be regarded\nas an impofture, an4 it may therefore\nbe afked, why it fluoqld be thought\nneceffary to give to the public a\ntranflation of papers, which may be\nthought interefting only to perfons\nwho\n\f[ xvi 3\nwho have been witneffes of the im-\npofture. To this enquiry feveral\ngood anfwers may be given.\nOne at which we have already\nhinted is the univerfal attention it has\nexcited at Paris, where it feems to\nhave divided the public fpeculations\nwith the celebrated and incomparable\ndifcovery of the aeroftatic globe.\nThere are furely few people of a\nliterary turn among lis, who will con-\nfefs themfelves void of curiolity re\"\nfpe&ing what engages all the faculties\nof our neighbours, or who will not\nconfefs that their literary purfuits\nare commonly at leaft as interefting\nand inftrudtive a fubjedt of enquiry,\nas their politics.\nSecondly, the Report of the com-\nmiffioners and the enquiries refpeft-\ning the animal magnetifm in general\nmay be confidered as relating not\nmerely to a temporary and unfoundecj\nhypothecs, but to the general ancj\nmoft important queftion refpedting\n\fthe influence of the imagination upon\nthe animal frame, a queftion peculi\u00ad\narly interefting to the metaphylician,\narid of the laft confequence in medi\u00ad\ncine. Upon this fubjedt the Report\nfeems to throw new light, and to\nhave a tendency to add precifion and\naccuracy to our notions in regard\nto it.\nBut the argument upon which we\nwould place the principal ftrefs is the\neffential importance of this fadl in the\nhiftory of the human mind. Per\u00ad\nhaps the hiftory of the errors of\nmankind, all things confidered, is\nmore valuable and interefting than\nthat of their difcoveries. Truth is.,\nuniform and narrow; it conftantly\nexifts, and does not feem to require\nfo much an adtive energy, as a paffive\naptitude of foul in order to encounter\nit. But error is endlefsly diverlified;\nit has no reality, but is the pure and\nfimple creation of the mind that in\u00ad\nvents it. In this field the foul has\na room\n\froom enough to expand herfelf* to\ndifplay all her boundlefs faculties, and\nall her beautiful and interelling ex\u00ad\ntravagancies and abfurdities. It is\nobferved of civil hiftory, that it is\nproperly the record of human calami\u00ad\nties; the fame thing may be obferved\nof cccleliaftical hiftory, it is the record\nof our errors. For this reafon a\nwell written. ecclefiaftical hiftory, a\nfpecies of composition that we fufpedl\ndoes not yet exift, would perhaps-\nbe the raoft inftrudtive ftudy in the\nworld.\nBut there is an additional reafon,\nwhich gives the error of the animal\nmagnetifm a particular claim to our\nattention. Thefame error was ftarted,\nif M. Thouret be in the right, two\ncenturies ago. It is therefore worth\nour curiofity to enquire, what diffe\u00ad\nrent inftruments were neceffary to.\ndeceive mankind in an ignorant and\nan enlightened age, in the commence\u00ad\nment of the feventeenth and the clofe\nof\n\ft)f the eighteenth century; in a Word\nto run a parallel between theborrowed\nfyftem of Mefmer, and the original\none of Paracelfus, Maxwel arid fir\nKenelm Digby. And as every pub\u00ad\nlication ought to be as complete as\npoflible withinitfelf, we havedeftined\nto allift the reader in this enquiry*\nthe enfuing paper of the fociety of\nmedicine refpedting Mi Thouret's per\u00ad\nformance.\nS. 'The following extractof a letter1\nfrom the beft authority from\nParis, has been received while\nthefe papers are in the prefs.\nIt relates to the particulars of &\nfa6t alluded to at the bottortl\nof page xiv.\n\" Mefmer has complained to the\nparliament of the report of the royal\ncommiflioners, and requefted that\nthey would appoint a new commif-\nfion, to examine \u2014 not his theory\nand pra&ice, but5\u2014aplan, which fliall\nex-\n\fexhibit the only poffible means of\ninfallibly demonftrating the exiflence\nand utility of his difcovery. The\npetition was printed : many thought\nthe parliament would do nothing in.\nit. But they have laid hold of it to\nclinch Mefmer, and oblige him to ex-\npofe all dire&ly; fo that it muft foon\nbe feen whether there is any diffe\u00ad\nrence between his method and Def-\nlon's.\u2014I give you their\n\" Arret, of the 6'Sept. 17.84.\n\" The parliament ordains that\nMefmer Jhall be obliged to expofe, be\u00ad\nfore four doctors of the faculty of\nmedicine, two furgeons and two\nmatters in pharmacy, the dodtrine,\nwhich he profeffes to have difcovered,\nand the methods which he pretends\nmuft be adopted for the application,\nof his principles: they likewife or\u00ad\ndain that a report of his communi\u00ad\ncations fliall then be delivered to the\nattorney general, to be laid before\nparliament for their fentence.\"\nREPORT\n\fR E P O R T\nOf a Committee of ihe Royal Society of\nMedicine, appointed toexaminea Work,\nentitled, ENQUIRIES AND E)OUBTS\nRESPECTING THE ANIMAL MAGNE-\nTISM, BY M. TH6URET, Regent Phy-\nJitiati of ihe Faculty of Paris, and Mem~\nber of the Society. To which are fub-\njoined, by the Tranftator, Notes, chiefly\nextracted froiri M. Thouret's Per\u00ad\nformance;\nTHE Underwritten werecharged by the\nroyal fociety of medicine, with the\nexamination of a work of M. Thouret,\nmember of the fociety, entitled. Enqui\u00ad\nries and Doubts refpedting the Animal\nMagnetifm.\nIn the attentive perufal of this work, it\nis obvious to remark^ that it has two very\ndiftinft objedts; bne of thern^ which is in\na manner hiftorical, is to explain the coin\u00ad\ncidences of the animal magnetifm, as it was\nknown to the ancients, with that which is\nadmitted by the moderns: the other con\u00ad\ntains critical refledtions and doubts in re\u00ad\ngard to the evidences upon which the\ndodtrine is founded, the uncertainty of\nB which\n\f[ * ]\nwhich M. Thouret undertakes to difplay.\nWe will endeavour to lay before the fociety\nan idea of his performance.\nThe animal magnetifm held a principal,\nrank among the fyftems, which were' em\u00ad\nbraced in that period of literary hiftory,\nwhen fuppofitions were admitted to hold\nthe place of fadts; and this hypothefis\nvanifhed, together with many others, when\nexperimental philofophy began to diffipate\nthe impoftures of the imagination, and to\nafford \"an accurate meafure of the value of\narts and fciences.\nThe objeft of this fyftem was afluid ex\u00ad\ntremely fubtle, upon which were bellowed\nthe magnificent titles of foul of the world,\nfpirit of the univerfe, and univerfal mag\u00ad\nnetic fluid j and which was pretended to be\ndiffufed through the whole fpace occupied\nby the material creation, to animate the\nfyftem ofnature, to penetrate all fubftances,\nand to be the vehicle to animated bodies in\n-general, and their feveral regions in parti\u00ad\ncular, of certain forces of attraftion and\nrepulfion, by means of which \"they ex-\u00bb\nplained the phenomena of nature.\nNor were they contented to admit, or\nrather to imagine, the fluid we have de\u00ad\nscribed; they flattered themfelves that\nthey were able, in certain methods, to\nrender themfelves tnafters of this fluid, and\nto direct; its operations. Even this did\nnot\n\ft 3 J\nhot terminate their chimerical preterifiorisi\nthey affirmed that this fluid, in which,\nthey admitted a fpecies of flux and reflux*\nexerted an.important degree of adtion upoii\nthe nerves* and had a grand analogy with\nthe vital principle; that its effedts, undef\nthe guidance of flcill and illumination, ex\u00ad\ntended to very great diftances, without the\nintervention of any foreign fubftancesj\nthat it was poffible to impregnate with it*\neither certain powders* in the manner of\nfir Kenelm Digby, who affer'ted that he\nhad done this, or fluids, or different parts\nof the bodies of animals j that this agent\nwas like light refledied by mirrors, and\nthat found and mufic augmented its in-\ntenfity.\nThe partifans of the animal magnetifm^\nwho wrote in the feventeenth century, did\nnot yet confine their hopes within thefe\nlimits: the art of directing thefluid, which\nthey had brought down from heaven, and\nwhich, according to them, adted in fo\n* diftinguifhed a manner upon the human\nbody, might be expe&ed to have a confi-\nderable fhare in the medical fcience, or\nrather to fuperfede that fcience, as it had\nhitherto exiftedj they did not fail toaffert,\nthat in caufing it to circulate in a proper\nmanner, the reftoration of difeafed organs\nwas infallible, as well the prefervation of\nB z the\n\fC 4 1\nthe health of thofe who were yet unat-\ntacked with any difeafe (i).\nSuch was the origin of an external and\nuniverfal medicine, of a fpecies entirely\nnew, and which boafted of having the ad\u00ad\nvantage of curing difeafes, without obliging\nany drugs to be fwallowed by the difeafed.\nSoon after poles were difcovered in the\n(i) \" Itmuftbe confefled however, that the man-\ntier of directing the pretended magnetifm, isdifferent.in\nthefe fyftems. The ancients, as well as M. Mefmer,\nregarded this fluid as univerfally diffufed,as pervading\nthe bodies of animals, and as capable of being rendered\nthe vehicle of the moft falutary influences^ But, in\norder to call it into a&ion, they did not, like M.\nMefmer, defire to touch, or fo much as to approach the\npatient. Their method confifted in a differentorder of\nproceeding. To give a fuitable direftion to the uni\u00ad\nverfal fpirit, they were obliged to employ real parts,\neither extra&ed or evacuated, of the individual upon\nwhom they propofed to dire\u00a3 the magnetifm. The\ndifferent humours of the human body, whether natural,\nas the blood, the urine, the excrements, or contrary to\nnature, as the pus bred in wounds; in fine^ the folid\nparts of the frame, as the flefh, the nails, the hair, in a\nftate of feparation from the body,afforded, according to\nthe ancient do\u00a3trine, the fuitable and neceffary meansi\nof employing the magnetifm. Thefe different parts, fo\nlong as they remained in a ftate of integrity, were fup-\npofed to be united in the link of a common vital princi\u00ad\nple with the individual who had furnifhed them. The\nunion was operated by the intervention of the univerfal\nfpirit, and in a&ing upon them, the phyfician was faid\nto a\u00a3t alfo uponthe perfon to whom they had belonged j\nan action,which, as it was independent of conta\u00a3, and\nwas not fuperfeded by diftance^ was regarded as mag\u00ad\nnetic.\" Tbouret*\nhuman\n\fhuman body, thatis, points,towards which\nit appeared that the adtion of this imagi\u00ad\nnary, fluid ought to be directed, cures and\nevacuations were operated without the af-\nfiftance of pharmacy, fenfations of various\nkinds were excited in the patients j and\nnotwithftanding the diftinguifhed efFedts\nafcribed to this agent, it was aflerted, that\nperfons the mod feeble and delicate might\nfubmit to its procefs without danger. The\nprocefs had yet another ufe, that of difco*\nvering the feat of -the diftemper; a thing\nfrequently fo difficult to be afcertained,\nbut which was pointed out by the fluid by\na fort of inftindtive intelligence, and with\nabfolute demonftration. It perfected the\nconcodtion of the humours; nervous dif-\ntempers in particular, rarely refitted its in\u00ad\nfluence j it was favourable to tranlpiration.\nIn fine, and this laft remark isof particular\nimportance, it had a powerful a&ion upon\nthe moral principles of our frame. A\npropenfity, that could fcarcely be refifled,\nwas the bafis of the attachment and gra\u00ad\ntitude, which were vowed by the patients\nto'thole who had employed upon them\nthis method of cure. Several, and in this\nnumber was Maxwel, even gave us to un-\nderftand, that it,was poffible, in certain\ncircumftances of human life, to make an\n\u00a33 m*\n\fImproper ufe of this vehicle of influ\u00ad\nence ( 2 ) .\nThis picture of the animal magnetifm?.\nas it was invented and applauded by the\nancients, is faithfully extracted from the\nperformance of M. Thouret. The prin?\ncipal aijthors, to which he has recoorfe in\nthe progrefs of his enquiry, are Paracelfus,\nVan Helmont, Qocleniys, Burgravius,\nLibavius, Wirdig, Maxwel, Santanelli,\nTentzel, Kirc-her and Borel (3). The entire\nPa!^r\n(2) c f Far be it from me,\" fays Maxwel, \"to lead\nyou to improper a\u00a3lions.

This\nGerman, having in his youth been afflided with an ill\n(late of health, which refilled the efforts of all the phy-\nficians, fufpe&ed that his diftemper might have a fupcr-\nnatural caufe,and derive from the influenceof the devil*\nHis conjecture was verified by his fuccefs in expelling\nthe devil, having adjured him in the name of Jefus\nChrift. From that moment he enjoyed the moft perfedl\nhealth for fixteen years. Encouraged by this event, he\nlaid afide the ftudy of medicine, to which his diftemper\nhad prompted him, and procured all the authors who\nhad treated of exorcifm. He began with healing his\nparifhioners in an obfeure town upon the borders of\nSwitzerland and the Tirol, and his reputation increafed\nfo much, that, in the twolaft years of his refidence there,\nhe had between four and five hundred patients who ap\u00ad\nplied to him. He then made a progrefsthrough feveral\nof the Swtfs cantons, and fettled at Ratifbon in 1774-\n' He diftinguifhed difeafes into two clafles, the natural\nand the demoniac, the laft of which were much the\nihoft numerous. Over the former he pretended to no\npower.\n\f[ h i\nattention to excite furprife in the fpecf-\ntators, than falutary effedts in their pa^\npower. His cures were performed with much pomp\nand folemnity; and it was obferved, that he conftantly\nrubbed his hands upon his girdle and handkerchief\nprevioufly to his touching the patient. He performed\nhis cures in the name of Chrift, and by the faithof the\ndifeafed in his holy name ; if their faith failed, the cure\ndid not take place. He gave the fick, when he difmifled\nthem, balm and oil, which he confidered as fpiritual\nmedicaments,together with certain waters and powders,\nand a little ring, inferred with the name of Jefus, to\nprevent a relapfe.\" Thouret.\nThouret confiders the fyftem of Gaflher as\nhaving had an influence on that of M.

It is afferted in this memoir,\nthat there is but one nature, one diftemper\nand one remedy j and this remedy is the\nanimal magnetifm. This phyfician, at the\nfame time that he acquainted the com-\nmiffioners with the doftrine and procefs\nof the magnetifm, inftrudted them in its\npradice by difcovering to them the poles,\nand fhewing them the manner of touching\nthe difeafed, and directing in regard to them\nthe magnetic fluid.\nM.Deffon undertook to the commiffion-\ners, in the firfl place,to evince theexiftence\nof the animal magnetifm; fecondly, to\ncommunicate to them his knowledge re-\nfpedting this difcovery j and thirdly, to\nprove the utility of this difcovery and\nof the animal magnetifm in the cure of\ndifeafes.\nAfter having thus made themfelves ac\u00ad\nquainted with the theory and pradtice of\nthe animal magnetifm, it was neceffary to\nobferve its effects.

That found, conform\u00ad\nably to the theory of M.

Deflon has made to them\nrefpedting the interior conftrudtion of the\n4 bucket,\n\fbucket, they cannot infer any phyfical\nagent, capable of contributing to the im\u00ad\nputed effedls of the magnetifm.\nThe patients then, arranged in con-\nfiderablexnumber and in fuccefiive ranks\nround the bucket, derive the magnetic\nvirtue at once from all thefe conveyances:\nfrom the branches of iron, which tranfm'it\nto them that of the bucket j from the cord\nwhich is paffed round their bodies, and\nthe union of their fingers, which com\u00ad\nmunicate to them that of their neighbours;\nand from the found of the piano forte, or\nof a mufical voice,which diffufes it through\nthe air. The patients are befide magne-\ntifed diredtly, by means of a finger or a bar\nof iron, guided before the face, above or\nbehind theiiead, and over thefurfaeeof the\nparts affedted, the diftindtion of the poles\nftill obferved j they are alfo adted upon by\na look, and by having their attention ex\u00ad\ncited. But especially they are magnetifed\nby the application of the hands, and by\nthe preffure of the fingers upon the hypo-\nchonders and the regions of the lower\nbelly j an application frequently continued\nfor a long time, fometimes for feveral\nhours.\nIn this fituation the patients offer a\nfpedtacle extremely varied in proportion\nto their different habits of body. Some\nof them are calm, tranquil and un-\nconfeious\n\fr 26 i\nconfcious to any fenfation ; others cough,\nfpit, are affeited with a flight degree of\npain, a partial or an univerfal burning,\nand perfpirations j a third clafs are agi\u00ad\ntated and tormented with convulfions.\nThefe convulfions are rendered extraordi\u00ad\nnary by their frequency, their violence\nand their duration. As foon as one perfon.\nis convulfed, others prefently are affe&ed\nby that fymptom. The commiffioners\nfaw acceffes of this kind, which lafted\nupwards of three hours; they were ac\u00ad\ncompanied with expectorations of a thick\nand vifcous water, brought away by the\nViolence of the efforts. Sometimes thefe\nexpectorationswereaccompanied with fmall\nquantities of blood y'and there is among\nothers a lad, a patient, who has fre\u00ad\nquently brought up blood in confide-\nrable abundance. Thefe convulfions are\ncharafjterifed by precipitate and involuntary\nmotions of all the limbs or of the whole\nbody, by a contra&ion of the throat, by\nfudden affedtions of the hypochonders and\nthe epigaftrium, by adiftradtion and wild-\nftefs in the eyes, by ftirieks, tears, hiccups\npings, and immoderate laughter. They are\neither pireceded or followed by a ftate of\nlanguor and reverie, by a fpecies of de\u00ad\njection and even drowfinefs. The leaft\nunforefeeii noife occafions ftarting j and it\nhas been obferved, that the changing of\n\fthe key and the time, in the airs played\nupon the piano forte, had an effedt upon\nthe patients; fo that a quicker motion\nagitates them more, and renews the vi\u00ad\nvacity of their convulfions.\nThereisanapartmentlined withquilting,\nwhich was originally deftined for the pa\u00ad\ntients in whom the magnetifm produced\nconvulfions, and is denominated the apart\u00ad\nment of crifes; but M. DefTon has not\njudged proper to make any ufe of it; and\nall the patients, whatever be the accidents'\nof their fituation, are placed together in\nthe apartment of public proceeding.\nNothing can be more aftonifhing than\nthe fight of thefe convulfions; he that has\nnot had it, can have no idea of it: and in\nbeholding it, a man is not lefs ftruck with\nthe profound repofe of one clafs of pati\u00ad\nents, than with the violence which agitates'\nanother; he obfe'rves with admiration\nthe various accidents that are repeated,\nand the fympathies that are developed. He\nfees fome patients feek each other .with\neagernefs; and in approaching fmile,\neonverfe with all the demonftrations of at\u00ad\ntachment, and foothe their mutual crifes.-\nThey are entirely under the government of\nthe perfon who diftributes the magnetic\nvirtue: in vain they may appear to be in\na ftate of the extremell drowfinefs, his\nvoicer a look, a fign from him roufes them.-\nIt\n\f[ 28 5\nIt is impoffible not to recoghife in thefe\nregular effects an extraordinary influence,\nadting upon the patients, making itfelf*\nmatter of them, and of which he who fa*\nperintends the procefs, appears to be the\ndepofitory.\nThefe convulfive affections are impro\u00ad\nperly fliled crifes in the theory of the ani\u00ad\nmal magnetifm : according to this doc\u00ad\ntrine indeed they are regardedas a falutary\ncrifis, of the lame kind as thofe which\n1 nature produces, or which a fkilful phyfi-\ncian has the art to excite to facilitate thei\ncure of difeafes. The commiffioners will\n-adopt this expreffion in the following re*\nport; and, wherever they employ the word\ncrifis, they will always underftand the\nconvulfive, drowfy or lethargic affections,\nproduced by the means of the animal\nmagnetifm.\nThe commiffioners obferved,. that in\nthe number of patients in the ftate of crifis,\nthere were always, many women and few\nmen : that it was one or two hours before\nthefe crifes took place j and that, when\none had taken place, all the others com-,\nmenced fucceffively, and without any con-\nfiderable interval. But after having made\nthefe general remarks, the commiffioners\nwere fpeedily of opinion, that the public\nprocefs could not be made the fcene of\ntheir experiments. The multiplicity of\n\f[ 29 1\nthe effedts is oneobftacle; too many things\nare feen at once for any one of them to be\nfeen well. Befide, the patients of rank,\nwho repair hither upon account of their\nhealth, might be difpleafed with the en\u00ad\nquiries of the commiflioners; the very adt\nof watching them might appear a nui-\nfance j and the recollection of this might\nbe burdenfome, and impede the commif\u00ad\nlioners in their turn. They therefore\nrefolved, that as their frequent attendance\nat the public procefs was unneceffary, it\nwould be fufficient for a few of them to\ngo from time to time, to confirm.the for\u00ad\nmer general obfervations, to make new ones\nin cafe an opportunity fhould occur for\nthat purpofe, and to report them to the\ncommiffion affembled.\nAfter having obferved thefe effe\u00a3ts at\nthe public procefs, it behoved them, in the\nnext place, to endeavour to difcover their\ncaufes, and enquire into the proofs of the\nexiftence and utility of the magnetilm.\nThe queftiop of its exiftence is firft in\norder j' that of its utility it were idle to\nexamine, till the other fhall have been fully\n\/refolved. The animal magnetifm may\nindeed exift without being ufeful, but it\ncannot be ufeful if it do not exift.\nOf confequence the fir ft objedt of at\u00ad\ntention with the commiflioners, and the\ndiredt tendency of their firft experiments,\n?ught\n\fought to be the afcertaining this exigence.\nAgain, this was itfelf an objedt of confide-\nrable comprehenfion, and had need of\nbeing Amplified. The animal magnetifrn\nembraces the whole compafs of nature;\nit is the vehicle, we are told, of the influ\u00ad\nence exerted upon us bythe celeftial bodies j\nthe commiffioners were of opinion, that\nthey ought, in the firft place, to leave this\nmoreextenfiveinfluenceoutof the queftion,\nand to confider only that part of the fluid\nwhich is diflfufed over the earth, without\ntroubling themfelveswith whence itcomes;\nin a word, to evince the aftion it exercifes\nupon us, around us, and within the fphere\nof our infpe&ion, before they undertook\nto examine its relation to the univerfe.\nThe raoft certain method of determining\nthe exiflence of the animal magnetic fluid,\nwoulcLhave been, to have rendered its pre-\nfence capable of being perceived by. the\nienefsj but much time was not neceffary to\nconvince the commifiioners that this fluid is\ntoo fubtle to be fubje\u00a3ted to their obfer-\nvation. It is not, like the eledlrical fluid,\nluminous and vilible; itsa&ionis not, like\nthe attraction of the loadftone, the objeft\nof our fight; it has neither tafte nor fmell;\nits procefs is filent, and it furrounds you\nor penetrates your frame, without your\nbeing informed of its prefence by the fenfe\nof touch. If therefore it exifl in us\nand\n\f[ 31 1\nand around us, it is after a manner per\u00ad\nfectly i'nfenfible. Thereare perfons among\nthofe who profefs the magnetifm, who pre- \u2022\ntend that it may fometimes be feen paffing\nfrom the extremity of the fingers, which\nferve it for conductors, or who believe that\nthey feel its paffage when you guide your\nfinger before their face, or along their\nhand. In the firfi: of thefe cafes, the'ema\u00ad\nnation perceived is merely that of trans\u00ad\npiration, which becomes completely vifible\nwhen viewed through a folar microfcope;\nin the fecond, the impreffion of cold or\nfrefhnefs which is felt, an impreffion by\nfo much the more perceptible the warmer\none is, refults from the motion of the air\nwhich follows the finger, and the degree-\nof whofe temperature is always below that\nof animal heat. When, on theother hand,\nthe finger is approached to the furface of\nthe face, which is colder than the finger,\nand it is held at reft, the confequence is a\nfenfation of heat, which is no other than\nthe communication of the animal heat. .\nIt is alfo pretended that this fluid has a\nfmell, and that it is perceived when either\nthe finger or an iron conductor is brought\ninto contiguity with the noftrilsj it is even\nfaid, that the fenfation is different, accord\u00ad\ning as the finger or the rod of iron is di\u00ad\nrected parallel with, or oppofite to the\npoles. M. DelTon efiayed the experiment\nupon\n\fr \u2022 3 * . ] \u2022\nttpon feveral of the cdmmiffionersj the\ncpmmiffioners themfe^ves have repeated\nit upon different fubjedts; not one has ex\u00ad\nperienced this difference of fenfation: and\njf, by giving a clofe attention, any fcent\nhas been perceived, it has been that of the\niron, when the rod has been prefented\nrubbed and heated j or that of the ema\u00ad\nnation of the tranfpiration, when ihe finger\nhas been prefented, a fcent frequently\ncombined with that of the iron with which\nthe finger itfelf has been impreffed. Thefe\neffedts have been erroneoufly attributed to\nthe magnetifm, but they may be traced in\nreality to natural and definite caufes.\nIndeed M. Deflon has never infixed\nupon thefe tranfient impreflions, he did\nnot think they-were to be offered in evi\u00ad\ndence j on the contrary he exprefsly af-\nfured the commiflioners, that he could not\ndemonftrate to them the exiftence of the\nmagnetifm, otherwife than by the adtion\nof this fluid, producing certain changes in\nanimated bodies. This exiftence is fo\nmuch the more difficult to be demonftrated\nby effedts, which fhall be incontrovertible,\nand whofe caufes ihall be unequivocal; by\nauthentic fadts, in cafes where moral cir-\ncumftances cannot exert their influence: in\na word, by proofs calculated to convince\nand compel the -underftanding, the only\nones which can yield any folid fatisfa&ion\n' tQ\n\f[ 33 1\nto perfons really proficient in the ftudy of\nnature,\nThe adtion of the. magnetifm upon Ani\u00ad\nmated bodies may be obferved in two dif-\nrent waysj either as it confifts in that\nadtion continued for a long tin>e, and in\nits falutary effedts in the treatment of dif-\neafes, or in its momentary effedts upon the\nanimal oeconomy and the perceptible\nchanges there produced. M. Deflon in-\niifted that the former of thefe methods\nihould be employed principally, and nearly\nexclufively y the commiffioners have been\nof a different opinion, and their reafons are\nas follow.\nThe majority of difeafes have their feat\nin the interior part of our frame. The\ncollective experience of a great number of\ncenturies has made us acquainted with the\nfymptoms,which indicate and difcriminate\nthem j the fame experience has taught the\nmethod in which they are to be treated.\nWhat is the objedt of the efforts of the\nphyfician in this method? It is not to op-\npofe and to fubdue nature, it is to affift her\nin her operations. Nature, fays the father\nof the medical fcience, cures the difeafed j\nbut fometimes lhe encounters obftacles,\nwhich conftrain her in her courfe, and\nufelefsly confume her ftrength. The\nphyfician is the minifter of nature; an at\u00ad\ntentive obferver, he ftudies the method in\nD which\n\fC 34 J\nwhich fhe proceeds. If that method be\nfirm, ftrong, regular and well directed, the\nphyfician looks oa in filence, and bewares\nof difturbing it by remedies which would\nat leaft be ufelefs; if the method be em-\nbarrafled, he facilitates it; if it be too flow\nor too rapid, he accelerates or retards it.\nSometimes, to accomplifh his objedt, he\nconfines himfelf to the regulation of the\ndiet: fometimes he employs medicines.\nThe aftion of a medicine, introduced\ninto the human body, is a newforce, com--\nbined with the principal force by which\nour life is maintained: if the remedy follow'\nthe fame route, which this force has al\u00ad\nready opened for the expulfion of difeafes,\nit is ufeful, it is falutary; if it tend to open\ndifferent routes, and to turn afide this in\u00ad\nterior adlion, it is pernicious. In the'\nmean time it muft be confefled that this\nialutary or pernicious influence, real' as it\nis, may frequently efcape common obfer-\nvation. The natural hiftory of man pre-\nfents us in this refpedt with very lingular\nphenomena. It may be there feen that re-^\ngimens the moft oppofite, have not pre--\nvented the attainment of an advanced old'\nage. We may there fee men, attacked\naccording to all appearance with the fame\ndifeafe, recovering in the purfuit of op\u00ad\npofite regimens, and in theufe of remedies\ntotally different frbm each other; nature is\n6 in\n\f[ 35 3\nin thefe inftances fufficiently powerful to\nmaintain the vital principle in fpite of the\nimproper regimen, and to triumph at once\nover the diftemper and the remedy. If it\nhave this power of refifting the adtion of\nmedicine, by a ftill ftronger reafon it mull\nhave the power of operating without me\u00ad\ndicine. The experience of the efficacy of\nremedies is always therefore attended with\nfome uncertainty j in the cafe of the mag\u00ad\nnetifm the uncertainty has this addition^\nthe uncertainty of its exiflence. How\nthen can we decide upon the adtion of aii\nagent, whofe exiftence is contefted, from\nthe treatment of difeafesj when the efFedt\nof medicines is doubtful, whofe exiftence\nis not at all problematical ?\nThe cure which is principally cited iii\nfavour of the magnetifm is that of M. le\nbaron de \u2014 ; all clalTes are acquainted\nwith its hiftory. We fhall not here entei-\ninto a difcuffion of the fa6ts j we {hall not\nenquire whether the remedies precedingly\nemployed might have contributed to this\ncure. On the one hand the very critical\nfituation of the patient is admitted, and ori\nthe other the inefficacy of all the ordinary\nmeans of medical fcience^ the magnetifm.\nhas been employed and M. le baron de\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 has completely recovered. But\nmight not a natural crifis have fingly ope\u00ad\nrated this recovery ? A woman of low\nD 2 rank\n\f[ 36 3\nrank and extremely poor, who lived at the\nGros-cailloU, was attacked in 1779 with a\nmalignant fever in all its fymptoms j ihe\nrefolutely refufed every affiftance, {he only\ndefired that ,a veflel which fhe had near her\nfliould be kept conflantly replenifhed\nwith water: (he remained quiet upon the\nflraw which ferved her for a bed, drinking\nwater continually and doing nothingmore.\n.The difeafe developed itfelf, paffed fuc-\nceflively through its different ft ages, and\nterminated in a complete cure*. . Made-\nmoifelle G who lived at the leffer\nroyal mews, had two indurations formed\nin her right breaft, which gave her great\npain; a furgeon recommended to her\nthe ufe of the Eau du Peintre as an ex\u00ad\ncellent diflolvent j at the fame time in\u00ad\nforming her, that if this remedy did not\nfucceed in a month, it would be neceffkry\nto extirpate them byincifion. Theyoung\nlady, terrified at this fentence, confulted\nM. Sallin, who gave it as his opinion that\nthe indurations were fufceptible of refo-\nlution; M. Bonvart, who was alfo con\u00ad\nfulted, confirmed theopinion of M. Sallin.\nJBeforeentering upon anycourfe of remedy,\n* The obfervation of this fact was laid in detail be\u00ad\nfore the faculty of medicine at Paris, in an aflembly de\nprima menfis, by M. Bourdois de la Mothe, phyfician\nof the charity of Saint-Sulpice, who vifited the.iick\nperfon regularly every day.\n$ey\n\f[ 37 1\nthey prefcribed diffipation j fifteen days\nafter fhe was feized at the opera with a\nviolent cough, and fo profufe an expedto-\nration, that fhe was obliged to be carried\nJiome i {he fpit in the fpace of four hours\nabout three pints of a vifcid lymph j one\nhour after .this M. Sallin examined the\nbreaft, he difcovered no trace of indura\u00ad\ntion. M. Bouvart, called in the next\nday, proved on his part the happy effect\nof this natural crifis. If mademoifelle\nG \u2022 had taken Eau du Peintre, the ho\u00ad\nnour of her cure would have been attri\u00ad\nbuted to this,medicine.\nThe uninterrupted observation of ages\nproves,and the profeflorsof phyficacknow-\nledge, that nature alone and without our\ninterference, cures a great number of per-\nfons. If the magnetifm were abfolutely\ninadtive, the patients, who undergo this\nmethod of cure, might be confidered as\nabandoned to nature. It would be absurd\nto chufe a method of deciding upon the\nexillence of this agent, which, by attri\u00ad\nbuting to it all the cures performed by na\u00ad\nture, would tend to prove that it had\nan adtion ufeful and curative, when in rea\u00ad\nlity it might have no adtion atall.\nUpon this head the commiffioners are\nof the opinion of M. Mefmer. He re\u00ad\njected the cure of difeafes, when this me\u00ad\nthod of proving the magnetifm was pro-\nD 3 pofed\n\f; [ s8 ]i\npofed to him by a member of the academy:\nof fciences: \" It is a miftake,\" replied he,\n\"\u2022to imagine that this kind of proof is\n\" unanfwerable j it cannot be demonftrat-\ned that either the phyfician or the me-\ndicine caufes the recovery of the pa-.\n\" tient*.\"\nThe treatment of difeafes can therefore\nfurnilh nothing but a refult, always un\u00ad\ncertain, often deceitful y nor can this un\u00ad\ncertainty be diffipated, and all the caufes of\nillufion compenfated,.but by an infinity of\ncures, perhaps by theexperience of fuccef-,\nlive centuries. The objedt and import-,\nance of the commiffion demand means of\na., fpeedier defcription. It was the duty\nof the commiffioners to confine themfelves\nto arguments purely phyfical, that is, to\nthe momentaneous effects of the fluid upon,\nthe animal frame, excluding from thefe;\neffedls all the illufions which might mix\nwith them, and alluring themfelves that\nthey could proceed from no other caufe\nthan the animal magnetifm.\nThey propofed to make experiments\nupon fingle fubjedts, who might be willing\nto fubmit to the various experiments\nwhich they fhould invent; and who, fome\n\u00abf them by their fimplicity, and others by\ntheir intelligence, fhould be capable of\n* M. Mefmerj Hiftorical Abridgement pages 35,37.\ngiving\n\ff 39 3\ngiving an cxaft and faithful account ac\u00ad\ncount of their fenfations. Thefe experi\u00ad\nments we fliall not confine ourfelves to\nrelate in the order of time, but fhallfollow\nthe order of the fadts they were intended\nto elucidate.\nThe commiffioners in the firfl place\nrefolved to make their fir ft experiments\nupon themfelves, and perfonally to expe\u00ad\nrience the adlion of the magnetifm. They\nwere extremely curious to become ac\u00ad\nquainted by their own fenfations with the\neffedts afcribed to this agent. They there\u00ad\nfore fubmitted themfelves to thefe effedts,\nand in fuch a difpofition, that they would\nnot have been forry to have undergone\nfome accidents and a partial derangement\nof health, which being evidently produced\nby the operation of the magnetifm, fhould\nhave enabled them to decide this import\u00ad\nant queftion upon the fpot, and with their\nown teftimony. But in fubmitting them\u00ad\nfelves to themagnetifm in this manner, the\ncommiffioners have employed one necef-\nfary precaution. There is not an indivi\u00ad\ndual, in a ftate of the fulleft health, who,\nif he paid a clofe attention to the point,\nwould not be fenfible to an infinity\nof interior motions and variationsj ei\u00ad\nther of a pain infinitely flight, or of\nheat in different parts of his body5\nthefe variations which exifl: at all times\nare independent of the magnetifm. To\nD 4 turn'\n\ft 4\u00b0 1\nturn and fix in this manner ones attention\nupon onefelf, is riot perhaps itfelf entirely\nwithout its effects. . There is fo intimate\na connection, whatever be the vehicle, of\nthat connection, between the volitions of\nthe foul and the motions of the body, that\nit is not eafy to prefcribe limits to the in\u00ad\nfluence of attention, which appears to be\nnothing more than a train of volitions,\ndirefted, conftantly and without interrup\u00ad\ntion, to the fame objedt. When we re\u00ad\ncoiled: that the arm is moved by the will\nas it pleafes, how can we be certain, that\nthe attention being fixed upon fome inte\u00ad\nrior part of our frame, may not excitefome\nflight emotion in it, direCt the heat to\u00ad\nwards it, and fo modify its aCtual litua-\ntion as to produce in it new fenfations ?\nThe firft thing therefore, to which the\ncomrniflioners were bound to attend, was\nnot to obferve too minutely what pafTed\nwithin them. If the magnetifm were a\nreal and operative caufe, there was no need\nthat itfhould be made an objeCt of thought,\nin order to its aCtion and manifefting it\u00ad\nfelf: it ought, fo to exprefs ourfelves, to\ncompel ana arreft the attention, and to\nrender itfelf perceptible to a mind that\nfhould even be diftraCted from it by defign.\nBut in determining to make experi\u00ad\nments upon themfelves, the commiffioners\nunanimoufly refolved to make thofe ex\u00ad\nperiments private, without admitting any\nftranger,\n\fftranger, except M. Deflon, by whom the\noperation was to be performed, or fuch\nperfons as they (hould chufe j in like\nmanner they engaged not to fubmit to the\nmagnetifm at the public procefs, in order\nthat they might difcufs freely their obfer-\nvations, and be . in all events the fole, OP\nat leaft the firft: judges of the fymptoms\nobferved.\nIn purfuance of thefe determinations, a\nparticular apartment and a feparate bucket\nwere deftined for their ufe in the houfe of\nM. Deflon, and the commifiioners repaired\nthither once in the courfe of every week.\nThe operation was continued in each ex\u00ad\nperiment for two hours and a half, the\nbranch of iron being in contact with the\nleft hypochonder, furrounded with a cord\nof communication, and forming from time\nto time the chain of fingers and thumbs.\nThey were magnetifed eitherby M.Deflon,\nor, in his abfence, by one of his pupils;\nibme of them for a longer time and more\nfrequently than others, and thofe with\nwhom this was the cafe were the com-\nmiffioners who appeared from conftitution\nand habit the moft fufceptible. The ope\u00ad\nration was performed fometimes with the\nfinger and the rod of iron prefented and\nguided along the different parts of the\nbody, fometimes by the application of the\nhands and the preffure of the fingers, either\nupon\n\fupon the hypochonders, or upon the pit\nof the ftomach.\nNot one of the commiflloners felt any\nfenfation, or at leaft none which ought to\nbe afcribed to the action of the magnetifm.\nSome of the commiflloners are of a robuft\nconftitution; others have more delicate\nhabits, and are fubjed to interruptions of'\ntheir health: one of thefe laft, wasfenfible\nof a flight pain at the pit of the ftomach,\nin confequence of a confiderable preflfure\nthat was employed upon that part. This\npain continued all that and the next day,\nand was accompanied with a fenfation of\nfatigue and dejedion. Another felt, in the\nafternoon of one of the days in which the\nexperiments were performed, a flight irri\u00ad\ntation of the nerves, to which he is very\nfubjedt. A third, endowed with a ftill\ngreater fenfibility, and efpecially with an\nextreme reftleffnefs of the nerves, was\nfubje\u00a3t to a higher degree of pain and\na more perceptible irritation; but thefe\nlefler accidents are the refult of perpetual\na.nd ordinary variations in the ftate of their\nhealth, and are of confequence foreign to\nthe operation they had undergone, or pro\u00ad\nceed only from the preffure employed upon\nthe region of the ftomach. The com-\nmiffioners do not fpeak of thefe flight\ndetails, but from a fcrupulous fidelity; they\nrelate them, becaufe they have impofed it\nas\n\fas. a.law upon themfelves conftantly and\nin every particular to \"fay the truth.\nThe commiffioners could not avoid being\nftruck with the difference of the private\nexperiment made upon themfelves from\nthe public procefs. All was calm and\nfilence in the one, all reftleffnefs and agi\u00ad\ntation in the othei^ j there multiplied\nfymptoms, violent crifes, the ordinary ftate\nboth of body and mind interrupted' and\noverthrown, and nature wrought tip to the\nhigheft pitch; here the body free from\npain, ana the mind from anxiety,, nature,\npreferving her ordinary courfe and her\nequilibrium, in a word the abfolute pri\u00ad\nvation of every kind of effeft: the llu-\npendous influence, which creates fuch an\naftonifhment in the public procefs, appears\nno longer; the magnetifm ftripped of its\nenergy feems perfectly fupine and inadtive.\nThe commiffioners, having at firfl fub-\nmitted to the experiment only once a vveek,r\nwere defirous to afcertain whether a conti\u00ad\nnuity of experiment would produce any\neffed: j they fubmitted to it three days\nfucceffively, but their infenfibility was the\nfame, and the magnetifm appeared with\nrefpedt to them perfectly impotent. This\nexperiment* made at once upon eight dif\u00ad\nferent fubje&s, feveral of whom were,\nfubjedt to habitual derangements of health,\nauthorifes the, conclufion that the mag\u00ad\nnetifm\n\fr 44 i\nnetifm has little or no adtion in a ftate of\nhealth, or even in a ftate of lefier infirmity.\nWe then refolved to make experiments\nupon perfons really difeafed, and we chofe\nthem out of the lower clafs.\nSeven of thefe were aflembled at Pally,\nat the houfe of Dr. Franklin; the opera\u00ad\ntion was performed upon them by M.\nDeflon in the prefence of all the com-\nmiffioners.\nThe widow Saint-Amand, afthmatic,\"\nhaving the belly, legs and thighs fwelled;\nand dame Anfeaume, who had a fwelling\nupon her thigh, felt no fenfation j the\nlittle Claude Renard, a child of fix years\nof age, fcrophulous, almoft consumptive,\nhaving the knees fwelled, the legs bent\ninward, and the articulation nearly de\u00ad\nprived of motion, a very interefting child,\nand pofle fling a greater degree of under-\nftanding than is ufual at his age, was%like-\nwile confeious to no fenfation j any more\nthan Genevieve Leroux, nine years of age,\nfubje<5t to convulfions, and to a diforder\ngreatly refembling that which is called\nSt. Vitus's Dance. Francis Grenet ex\u00ad\nperienced fome effects 5 he had adiftemper\nin his eyes, particularly in the right, in\nwhich he had fcarcely any fight, and in\nwhich there was a confiderable tumour.\nWhen the operation was directed towards\nthe left eye, by approaching and moving\nbackward\n\ft 45 ]\nbackward and forward the thumb very\nnear and for a confiderable time, he was\nfenfible of a pain in the ball of the eye*\nand the eye watered. When the operation\nwas directed to the right eye, which, was\nthe moil difordered, he felt no fenfation\nin it; he felt the fame pain in the left\neye, and nothing in any other part of the\nbody.\nDame Charpentier,whohad been thrown\n\u2022down againft a log of wood by a.cow two\nyears before, had experienced the moft un\u00ad\nfortunate confequences from this accident;\nfhe loft her fight, recovered it afterwards\nin part, but remained in a ftate of habitual\ninfirmities; fhe declared that fhe had two\nruptures, and the belly of fo great fenfi-\nbility, that fhe could not bear the preffure\nof the firings of her petticoats : this jfenfi-1\nbility belongs to the cafe of nervous irrita\u00ad\ntion; the flighteft preffure upon the region\nof the belly is capable of determining this\nirritation, and producing, through the\ncorrefpondence of the nerves, effedts in\nevery part of the body.\nThe operation was performed upon this\nwoman as upon the reft by the applica\u00ad\ntion and the preffure of the fingers.; the\npreffure was extremely painful to. her :\nafterwards, in directing the finger towards\nthe rupture, fhe complained of a pain in\nher head; the finger being placed before\n\f[ 46 3\nher Face, (he faid fhe could not draw her\nbreath. Upon the repeated motion of the\nfinger upwards and downwards, Ihe had\nfudden ftarts of the .head and fhoulders,\nlike thofe which are commonly occafioned\nby furprife mixed with terror, for inftance\nthat of a perfon who has fome drops of\ncold water fuddenly thrown in his face.\nShe appeared to have the fame jftartings\nwhen her eyes were clofed. The fingers\nbeing held under her nofe, while her eyes,\nwere fliut, fhe complained of a fenfation\nof faintnefs fo long as they were continued\nthere. The feventh fubjedt, Jofeph En-\nnuye, experienced fenfations of a fimilar\nnature, but much lefs confiderable.\nOf thefe feven patients four felt no\nfenfation at all; three experienced fome\neffects from the operation; Thefe effedts\ndeferved to engage the attention of the\ncommiffioners, and demanded an accurate\n^examination.\nThe commiffioners, to obtain further\nlight, and to define their ideas upon this\npart of the fubjedt, refolved to make the\nexperiment upon patients, placed in other\ncircumftances, and feledted from the polite\nworld j fuch as could not be fufpedted of\nfinifter views, and whofe underftanding\nmade them capable of enquiring into and\ngiving a faithful account of their fenfa\u00ad\ntions. Mefdames de B- and de V ,\nmeffieurs\n\fE 47 I\nmeffieurs M\u2014\u2014 and R were ad\u00ad\nmitted to the private bucket together with\nthe commiffioners; they were intreated to\nremark their fenfations, without fixing\nupon them too regular an attention. M.\nM\u2014;\u2014 and madame de V were the\nonly perfons who experienced any fenfa-\ntion. M. M had an indolent tumour\nover the whole articulation of the knee,\nand a conftant pain in the patella. He\ndeclared, during the operation, that he felt\nnothing in any part of his body, except iri\nthe moment that the finger was guided\nbefore the difeafed knee; he then thought\nthat he felt a flight degree of heat in the\nplace, in which he has habitually the fen-\nfation of pain. Madame de V , at\u00ad\ntacked with a nervous diforder, was feveral\ntimes upon the point of falling afleep\nduring the operation. The experiment\nhaving continued for an hour and nineteen\nminutes without interruption, and for the\ngreater part by the application of the hands,'\nfhe was fenfible to nothing but a fen-,\nfation of irritation and dejedtion. Thefe\ntwo fubjedts underwent the experiment\nonly once. M. R , whofe diftemper\nwas the remainder of an obflrudtion in the,\nliver, the confequence of a very violent\ndiforder of that kind ill cured, underwent\nthe operation three times and felt nothing.\nMadame de B\u2014\u2022\u2014, feverely attacked with\n' obftrudtions,\n\fobftrudtions, underwent the experiment\n\u2022 conftantly at the fame time with the com-\nmiffioners, and felt nothing j it is neceflary\nto obferve, that fhe fubmitted to the\nmagnetifm with an extreme tranquility,\n\u2022which originated in the higheft degree of\nincredulity.\nExperiments were made at other times\nupon different fubjedts, but without the\nafliftance of the bucket. One of the com-\nmiflioners, in a violent head-ach, had the\noperation performed upon him by M.Def-\nIon for half an hour; one of the fymptoms\nof his diforder was an extreme cold in his\nfeet. 'M. Deflon brought his .foot near\nthat of the patient, the foot was never the\nwarmer, and the head-ach lafted its ordi\u00ad\nnary term. The patient, having placed\nhimfelf near a fire, obtained from it the\nfalutary effects which'heat has conftantly\nprocured him, without experiencing,either\nduring that day or the night following,\nany efFedt from the magnetifm.\nDr. Franklin, though the weaknefs of\nliis health hindered him from coming to\nParis, and affifting at the experiments\nwhich were there made, was magnetifed\nby M. Deflon at his own houfe at Pafly.\nThe affembly was numerous; every perfon\nwho was prefent underwent the operation.\nSome lick perfons, who had come with\nM. Deflon, were fubjett to the effe&s of\n\fC 49 3\nthe magnetifm in the fame manner as at\nthe public procefs; but madamede B ,\nDr. Franklin, his two relations, his fecre-\ntary, and an American officer, felt no fen*\nfation, though one of Dr. Franklin's re\u00ad\nlations was convalefcent, and theAmerican\nofficer had at that time a regular fever.\nTheexperiments wehave related,furnifh\na number of fadts, calculated to illuftrate,\nand fit to be compared with each other,\nand from which the commiflioners were\nat liberty to deducecertain inferences. Of\nfourteen fick perfons five only appeared to\nfeel any efFedt from the operation, nine\nfelt no efFed at all. The commiffioner,\nwho had the head-ach and coldnefs in the\nfeet, derived no benefit from the mag\u00ad\nnetifm, nor did his feet recover their\nnatural heat. This agent has not therefore\nthe property which has been attributed to it\nof communicating heat to the feet. The\nmagnetifm has alfo been faid to have the\nproperty of difcovering the fpecies, and\nparticularly the feat of difeafes, by the\npain, which the adtion of this fluid infal\u00ad\nlibly occalions in that part.. Such an ad\u00ad\nvantage would be of great confequence;\nthe fluid which was the inftrument of it\nwould be a valuable means in the hands of\nthe phyfician, often deceived by equivocal\nfymptoms : but Franfois Grenet felt no\nfenfation, no pain, but in the eye leafl\nE affected.\n\f[ 50 J\naffefted. If the rednefs and tumour of thtf\nother eye had not furniftied external fymp-\ntoms, in judging from the effe<5t of the\nmagnetifm we fliould have been led to\nconclude that it was undiftempered. M.\nR and madame de B , both at\u00ad\ntacked with obftru&ions, and madame de\nB with great feverity, as they were.\nconfcious to no fenfation, would have re-\nceived no intelligence, either refpe\u00a3ting the\nfpecies, or the feat of their difeafe. And\n,yet obftruflions are among the diforders,\nwhich are faid to be particularly fubjeft to\nthe aflion of the magnetifm j fince ac\u00ad\ncording to the new theory the,free and\nrapid circulation of this fluid through the\nnerves, is a means of opening thechannels\nand deftroying the obftacles, that is, the\nobftru6tions, which it encounters in its\npalfage. It is at the fame time faid that\nthe magnetifm is the touchftone of health :\nif therefore M. R and madame-de\nB\u2014\u2014 had not experienced the derange\u00ad\nments and the Sufferings infeparable from\nobftruttions, they would have had a right\nto believe that they enjoyed the belt health\nin the world. The fame thing may be\nfaid of the American officer : the mag\u00ad\nnetifm therefore announced as the dis\u00ad\ncoverer of difeafes completely failed of\nits effeft.\nThe\n\f[ J. ]\nThe heat that M. M\u2014\u2014\u2022 felt in the\npatella, is an effe& too flight and fugitive\nto authorife any conclufions. It may be\nfufpe\u00a3ted that it proceeded from the caufe\nalready defcanted on, a too great attention\nto obferve what pafles within us: the fame\nattention would difcover fimilar fenfations\nat any other time, when the magnetifm\nwas not employed. The drowfinefs ex\u00ad\nperienced by madame de V muft un\u00ad\ndoubtedly be afcribed to the regularity and.\nfatigue of preferving the fame fituation\nif flie was fenfible to any vaporous emo\u00ad\ntion, it muft be remembered that it is a.\nknown property of nervous afFedtions, to\nhave,much dependency, upon the attention,\nthat is paid them j to-renew them it, is.\nonly neceflfary to.hear them fpoken of, or\nto think of them. It is* eafy to judge\nwhat ought to be expedted from a woman,\nwhofe nerves are extremely irritable, and\nwho, being magnetifed for an hour and\nnineteen minutes, had during that time\nno other fubjedt of reflection than, that of\nthe diforders which are habitual to her.\nShe might have had a nervous crifis more\nconfiderable than that we have defcribed,\nwithout our having a right to be furprifed\nat it-\nThere remains then only the effedts\nproduced upon dame Charpentier, Fran-\n\u00a3ois Grenet and Jofeph Ennuye, which\nE 2 can\n\fE s * _ J\ncan be fuppofed to derive from the opera-*\ntiori of the magnetifm. In comparing\nthefe three particular fadts to the reft, the\ncommiffioners were aftonifhed that three\nfubjedts of the lower clafs fhould be the\nonly ones who felt any thing from the\noperation, while thofe of a more elevated\nrank, of more enlightened understandings,\nand better qualified to defcribe their fenfa-\ntions, have felt nothing. Without doubt\nFranfois Grenet experiencied a pain and a\nwatering in the eye when the thumb was\napproached very near to it; dame Char-\npentier complained, that in touching her\nftomach the prefTure correfponded to her\nrupture j and the preffure might have been\nin part the caufe of what {he felt; but the\ncommiffioners fufpedted that thefe fenfa-\ntions were augmented by moral caufes.\nLet us reprefent to ourfelves the fitua-\ntion of a perfon of the lower clafs, and of\nconfequence ignorant, attacked with a\ndiftemper and defirousof acure, introduced\nwith fome degree of ceremony to a large\ncompany, partly compofed of phyficians,\nwhere an operation is performed upon\nhim totally new, and from which he per-\nfuades himfelf before hand that he is about\nto experience prodigious effects. Let us-\nadd to this that he is paid for his compli\u00ad\nance, that he thinks he fhall contribute\nmore to our fatisfa&iori by profeffing to\nexperience\n\ff 53 3\nexperience fenfations of fome kind; and\nwe fhall have definite caufes to which to\nattribute thefe effeits j we (hall at leaft\nhave juft reafon to doubt whether their\ntrue caufe be the magnetifm.\nBefide this it may be enquired, why the\nmagnetifm produced thefe effedts upon\nperfons, who knew what was doneto them,\nand might imagine they had an interest in\nfaying what they faid, while it took no fort\nof hold upon the little Claude Renard,\nupon an organifation endowed with all the\ndelicacy of infancy, fo irritable, fo fufcep-\ntible? The found underftanding and inge\u00ad\nnuous temper of this child evince the vera-\n\u2022city of his relation. Why too has this\nagent produced no effedt upon Genevieve\nLeroux, who was in a perpetual ftate of\nconvulfion ? Her nerves were certainly\nfufficiently irritable, how comes it that the\nmagnetifm did not difplay its power,\neither in augmenting, or diminifhing her\nconvulfions ? Her indifference and impaf-\nfibility induced the belief, that the reafon\nof her having felt nothing, was the idiot-\nifm which did not permit her to judge\nthat (he ought to have felt any thing.\nFrom thefe fa6ts the commiffioners are\nat liberty to obferve, that the magnetifm\nhas feemed to have no exiftence for thofe\nfubje6ts, who have fubmitted to it with\nany degree of incredulity; that the com-\nE 3 miflioners,\n\fmiflloners, even thofe who have their\nnerves moft irritable, having exprefsly\nturned their attention to other obje&s, and\nhaving armed themfelves with that philb-\nfgphic doubt which ought always to ac\u00ad\ncompany enquiry, have felt none of thofe\nfenfations, which were experienced by the\nthree patients of the lawer clafs j and they\nhave a right to fufpedt that thefe fenfa\u00ad\ntions, fuppofing their reality, were the\nfruits of anticipated perfuafion, and might\nbe operated by the mere force of imagina\u00ad\ntion. Of this fufpicion another clafs of\nexperiments has been the refult. Their\nfubfequent refearches were directed towards\na new objed j it was neceflary to deftroy\nor confirm the fufpicion they had formed,\nto determine to what degree the power of\nthe imagination can influence our fenfa\u00ad\ntions, and to demonftrate whether it can\nbe the caufe, in whole or in part, of the\nefFedts attributed to the magnetifm.\nAt this time the commiflioners heard of\nthe experiments, which were made at the\nhoufe of M. the dean of the faculty by M,\nJumelin, do\u00a3tor of phyfic; they were de-\nfirous of feeing thefe experiments, and\nthey met M. Jumelin in a body at the\nhoufe of M. Majault, one of the commif-\nfioners. M. Jumelin declared to them\nthat he was a difciple neither of M. Mef-\njner, nor of M, Def|on; he had learned\nnothing\n\ft 55 3\nnothing refpe\u00a3ting the animal magnetifm\nfrom them, but had formed his principles\nand digefted his procefs from what he\nhad heard upon the fubje\u00a3t in converfa-\ntion. His principles confift in regarding\nthe animal magnetic fluid, as a fluid which\ncirculates in the human body, and which\nflows from it, but which is effentially the\nfame with the principle of animal heat j\nlike all other fluids he conceived that it\ntended to an equilibrium, and that it\ntherefore pafles from the body in which\nthe greateft quantity of it refides, into that\nwhich has the leaft. His method does\nnot differ from that of meffieurs Mefiper\nand Deflon lefs than his principles; like\nthem he performs the operation with the\nfinger and the rod of iron as conductors,\nand by the application of the hands, but\nwithout any diilindtion of poles.\nEight men and two women fubmitted\nto the operation in the firft experiment,\nand felt nothing; at length a woman, who\nwaits in the hall of M. Alphonfe le Roy,\ndodtor of phyfic, having been magnetifed\nin the forehead, b-ut without touching.her,\nfaid that fhe felt the fenfation of heat.\nM. Jumelin guiding his hand, and pre-\nfenting the five extremities of his fingers\nover the whole of her face, fhe faid that\n{he felt as it were a flame, that pafTed from\nplace to.place3 magnetifed in the ftomach\nE 4 fhe\n\fI 56 ]\nfhe faid that fhe felt heat; magnetifed upon\nthe back Hie made the fame declaration:\nfhe alfo faid that flie felt hot in every part\n..of her body, and that her head ached.\nThe commiffioners, obferving that, of\neleven perfons. that underwent the expert\nment, one only had been fenfible to the\nmagnetifm of M. Jumelin, were of\nopinion that this perfon had experienced\ncertain fenfations, only becaufe fhe had\nprobably an imagination more eafily ex-^\ncited than the reft : the opportunity was\nfavourable for clearing up the point. The\nfenfibility of this woman being perfectly\neftablifhed, the bufinefs was only to pro\u00ad\ntect her from the illusions of the imagi-,\nnation, or at leaft to leave her imagination\nwithout any thing to diredtits operations,\nThe commiffioners propofed to blindfold\nher, in order to obferve what her fenfa-r\ntions would be, when fhe could no longer\nknow any thing refpedtjng the condutt of\nthe experiment. She. was accprdingly\nblindfolded and magnetifed; the pheno\u00ad\nmena no longer anfwered to the places\ntowards which the magnetifm was diredt*\ned. Magnetifed fucceffively upon the\nflomach and in the back, fhe felt only a\nheat in her head, a pain in both eyes and in\nthe left ear,\nThe bandage was removed from her\neyes, and M. JupieJin having applied his\nhands\n\fhands upon the hypochonders, fhe faid\nthat fhe felt heat; after a few minutes fhe\nfaid that fhe was ready to faint, and fhe\nfainted in effedt. When fhe was tolerably\nrecovered, the experiment was refumed,\nfhewas blindfolded,M.Jumelinwas remov\u00ad\ned,filence recommended,andthewomanwas\ninduced to believe that the operation was\nperforming. The effedtswere the fame,\nthough no operation, either near or diftant\nwas performed; fhe felt the fame heat, the\nfame pain in her eyes and in her ears; be-\nfides which fhe felt a heat in her back and\nJoins.\nAfter a quarter of an hour, a fign was\nmade to M, Jumelin to magnetife her in\nthe ftomach, fhe felt no fenfation ; in the\nback, it was the fame thing. The-fenfa-\ntions diminifhed inftead of augmenting.\nThe pains in her head continued, the heat\nin her back and loins ceafed.\nWe fee in this inftance certain effedts\nproduced, and thefe fimilar to thofe which\nwere experienced by the three fubjedls, re-\nfpedting whom the experiment has already\nbeen detailed. But the former and the\nlatter were obtained in different methods j\nit follows that this differenceis of no con-\nfequence. The procefs of meffieurs Mef-\nmer and Deflon, and an oppofite procefs\nhave produced the fame phenomena. The\nfliftindtion of poles is therefore chimerical.\nIt\n\fI J8 ]\nIt may be obferved that while the\nwoman was permitted to fee the operation,\nfhe placed her fenfations precifely in the\npart towards which it was directed; that\non the other hand when fhe did not fee\nthe operation, fhe placed them at hazard,\nand in parts very diftant from thofe which\nwere the objedt of the magnetifm. It was\nnatural to conclude that thefe fenfations,\nreal or pretended, were determined by the\nimagination. Of this we were convinced\nwhen we faw. that being entirely at reft,\nthe precedingfenfations having ceafed, and\nthe bondage being fixed over her eyes, this\nwoman experienced all the fame effedts,\nthough no operation was performed \u2022> but\nthe demonftration was complete, when\nafter a remiffion of a quarter of an hour,\nher imagination being undoubtedly cooled\nand worn down, the effects, in the room\nof augmenting, diminifhed at the moment\nin which the operation was adtually re\u00ad\nnewed, . '\nIf {he was feized with a faintnefs,\nwomen are fometimes liable to this ac\u00ad\ncident from their.garments. being tight\nor otherwife burdenfome. The applica\u00ad\ntion of the hands upon the hypochonders\nwas capable of producing the fame effect\nupon a woman extremely fufceptible; but\nthere is no need of having recourfe to this\ncaufe to explain the appearance. The\nweather\n\f[ 59 1\nweather was extremely hot, the woman\nhad unqueftionably felt fome emotion in\nthe beginning of the experiment, flie had\nmade an effort upon herfelf to fubmit to\na new and unknown operation, and it is\nby no means extraordinary that an effort,\ncontinued for a longer time than the\nconftitution will bear, fhould occafion a\npropenfity to faint.\nThis fwoon had therefore a natural\nknown caufe, but the fenfations, which\nIhe experienced when no operation was\nperformed upon her, could be only the\nrefult of imagination. In fimilar experi\u00ad\nments, which M. Jumelin made in the\nfame place the next day, the commiffioners\nbeing prefent, upon a man who was\nblindfolded, and upon a woman who was\nnot blindfolded, the refult was precifely\nthe fame; it was evident their anfwers\nwere determined by the queftions that\nwere put to them, that is, the queftion\npointed out where the fenfation was ex\u00ad\npected to be j in the room of directing the\nmagnetifm upon them, all that was done\nwas the exalting and dire6ling their imagi\u00ad\nnation. A child of five years of age being\nafterwards magnetifed, felt nothing but\nthe heat which he had jufl before con\u00ad\ntracted at play.\nThefe experiments appeared fufficiently\njmportant to the commiffioners, for them\nto\n\fto defire a repetition of them, in order to\nobtain further light into the fubjedt, and\nM. Jumelin had the complaifance to com\u00ad\nply with their requeft. It would be to\nno purpofe to objeft, that the method of\nM. Jumelin was a bad onej for at the\nprefent moment it was not propofed to\nbring the magnetifm, but the imagination\nto the proof.\nThe commiffioners agreed to blindfpld\njfubjefts who had already undergone the\nmagnetical operation, for the moft part\nnot to magnetife them at all, but to put\nto them interrogations, fo framed as to\npoint out to them their anfwers. This\nmode of proceeding was not calculated to\ndeceive them, it only mifled their imagi\u00ad\nnation. In reality, when no operation was\nperformed upon them, their fole anfwer\nought to have been, that they felt no fen-\nfation ; and when the operation was per\u00ad\nformed, the impreffion they felt, not the\nmanner in which they were interrogated,\nought to have dictated their replies.\nThecommiffioners adjourned themfelves\nto the houfe of M. Jumelin ; they began\nwith an experiment upon his fervant. They\nfixed a bandage over his eyes, prepared for\nthe purpofe, and which they employed in\nall the 1'ucceeding experiments. The ban\u00ad\ndage was made of two calottes of elaftic\ngum, whofe concavity was filled with\nedredon $\n\fcdredon; the whole inclofed and fown up\nin two pieces of ftuff of a circular form.\nThefe pieces of ftuff were then fattened\nto each other, arid to twa firings which\nwere tied in a knot at the back part of the\nhead. Placed ove^the'eyes, they left in\ntheir interval rqdth for the nofe, and the\nentire liberty of refpiration, without the\nperfon blindfolded being permitted to re\u00ad\nceive even the fmalleft particle of light,\neither through, or above, or below the\nbandage. Thefe precautions having been\ncontrived, with an equal view to the con\u00ad\nvenience of the fubjedt, and the certainty\nof the refult, the lervant of M. Jumelin\nwas perfuaded that the operation was per\u00ad\nforming upon him. Upon this he felt an\nalmoft univerfal fenfation of heat, and\ncertain emotions in the region of the belly,\ntogether with an extreme heavinefs j by\ndegrees he grew drowfy and appeared upon\nthe point of falling afleep. This experi\u00ad\nment proves what we have already faid*\nthat the fymptom of drowfinefs is the\neffed: of fituation and wearinefs, not of;\nthe magnetifm.\nThe fame perfon being afterwards mag\u00ad\nnetifed with his eyes uncovered, and a rod\nof iron being prefented to his forehead,,\nhe experienced fenfations of pricking : the\nbandage being then replaced and the cir-\ncumftance repeated, he was confcious to\nno\n\fno fenfation. The rod of iron was then\nremoved, and the patient being interro\u00ad\ngated if he felt nothing in his forehead,\nhe declared that he felt fomething move\nbackward and forward from one fide of it\nto the other.\nM. B , a man of learning, and\nparticularly acquainted with the fcience of\nmedicine, was then blindfolded, and pre-\nfented us with the fame fpedtacle, feeling\ncertain fenfations when he was not a<5ted\nupon, and often feeling nothing when the.\noperation was performed. Thefe fenfa\u00ad\ntions went to fuch a length, that, previ-\noufiy to the being magnetifed in any man\u00ad\nner, but believing that the operation had\nbeen performing for ten minutes, he felt\na heat in his loins which he compared to\nthat of a ftove. It is evident that M.\nB- had a very ftrong fenfation, fince,\nin order to convey an idea of it, he thought\nit neceffary to have recourfe to fuch a\ncomparifon j this fenfation however he\nowed folely to imagination, which was the\nonly agent concerned in the affair.\nThe commiffioners, particularly thofe of\nthe faculty of medicine, made an infinite\nnumber ofexperiments upon different fub-\nje&s, whom they either magnetifed them-\nfelves, or perfuaded that they underwent\nthe operation. They performed the ope\u00ad\nration indifferently, either oppolite to, or\n6 in\n\ft 63 i\nin the diredrion of the poles or at right\nangles with them, and in each cafe obtained\nthe fame effedls; experiencing in all thefe\nexperiments no other difference, than that\nof an imagination more orlefs fufceptible.%\nThey\n* M. Sigault, doctor of the faculty of Paris, well\nknown for hisinvention of the operationof thefymphyfis\nof the ofTa pubis, made a number of experiments, tend\u00ad\ning to prove that the magnetifm is merely an imagi\u00ad\nnary power. The following is the detail which he made\nin a letter, dated July the 30th, 1784, and addreiled-to; -\none of the commiffioners.\n\" Having given the perfons who inhabited a large\n\" houfe in the Marais, to underftand that J was a pupil\n\" of M. Mefmer, I produced various effedls upon the\n' \" woman of the houfe. The magifterial tone and the\n\" ferious air I affe&ed, together with certain geftures*\n<c made a very great impreffion upon her, which .flie\n<c at firft was defirous to conceal from me; but having\n\" guided my hand upon the region of the heart, I felt\n\" that it palpitated* The ftate of oppreflion in which\ncc \u00a3he appeared likewife indicated a contraction of the\n\" cheft. Other fymptoms were connected with thefe;\nher face became convulfed, her eyes wandered, fhe\n\" at length fell into a fwoon, then threw up her dinner,\n\" had feveral ftools, and was reduced to a ftate of.\n\" weaknefs and finking, perfectly incredible, I re-\n\" peated the fame trick upon feveral perfons, and fuc-\n\" ceeded more or lefs, according to their different\n\" degrees of fenfibility and credulity.\n<c A celebrated artift, mafter of defign to the chil-\n<c dren of one of our princes, complained for feveral\n\" days of an extreme head-ach j he acquainted me\n\" with it upon the Pont-royal; having perfuaded him\niC that I was initiated in the myfteries of M. Mefmer,\n\" I expelled hjs head-ach almoft inftantaneoufly by the\n\" means of a few geftures, to his great aftoniftiment.\n\f[ H ]\nThey were therefore convinced that the\nimagination alone is capable of producing\n\" I produced the fame effefts upon the apprentice of\n\" a hatter in the fame diftemper. The lad felt nothing\nin confequence of my firft geftures - I then laid my\n*c hand upon his falfe ribs, bidding him at the fame time\nlook in my face. He immediately felt a contraflion\n(C of the cheft, palpitations of the heart, yawnings, and\nc< an extreme dejection. He doubted no longer of the\npower I pofTefled over him. I then guided my finger\n\" over the part affe&ed, and afked him what he felt.\n44 He replied that his paindiflodged itfelf and defcended.\n44 I allured him that I would guide it towards his, arm,\n44 and make it come out at his thumb, at the fame time\n44 fqueezing it with confiderable force. He took me!\n44 at my word, and was perfe&ly well for two hours.\n44 At that period he ftopped me in the fireet to tell me\n44 that his pain was returned. This effefl: feems to be\n44 the fame with that produced by certain dentifts upon\n44 the mental faculties of thofe, who gotothem tohave a\n44 tooth drawn. v\n44 Further laftly, being in the parlour of a convent,\n44 rue du Colombier, fauxbourg Saint Germains, a\n44 young lady faid to me: I underftand, fir, that you are\n44 a pupil of M. Mefmer. I am fo, replied I; and\n44 I can perform the magnetical operation upon you,\n44 notwithftanding the intervention of the grate. At\n44 the fame time I prefented my finger; flie was terri-\n44 fied, trembled extremely, and befought me for God's\n44 fake to proceed no farther. Her emotion was fuch,\n*4 that, if I had perfevered in my experiment, ftie would\n44 infallibly have fallen into convulsions.\"\nM. Sigault relates that he had himfelf felt the power\nof imagination. One day, the operator having under\u00ad\ntaken to perform upon him the magnetical operation\nto convince him of its reality, at the moment he had\ndetermined to touch him, he felt a contraction of the\ncheft, and a palpitation of the heart. But having im\u00ad\nmediatelycompofed himfelf, thegeftures and the procefs\nof the magnetifm were employed in vain, and made no\nimprefllon upon him,\nvarious\n\fvarious fenfations, and caufing the patient\ntoexperience both pain and heat, and even\na very confiderable degree of heat, in all\nparts of the body, and they concluded that\nit of courfe entered for a confiderable fhare\ninto the effects attributed to the animal\nmagnetifin. It muft at the fame time be\nadmitted, that the procefs of the magnetifm\nproduces in the animated body changes\nmore diftinguifhed, and derangements more\nconfiderable, than thofe we have juft re\u00ad\nported. None of , thofe fubjeits, whom\nwe have hitherto defcribed as the imaginary\nobjedls of the magnetical operation, were\nfo far imprefled as to produce convulfions;\nit was therefore a new fubjedt for the ex\u00ad\nperiments of the commiffioners, to enquire,\nwhether by the mere energies of the ima\u00ad\ngination it were poffible to produce crifes,\niimilar to thofe which we have ftated in the\npublic procefs.\nMany experiments were thought of for\nthe decifion of this queftion. When a\ntree has been touched according to the\nprinciples and method of the magnetifm,\nevery perfon who flops under it, ought to\nexperience in a greater or lefs degree the\neffects of this agent there have even been\nfome in this fituation who have fwooned,\nor experienced convulfions. We commu\u00ad\nnicated our ideas upon this fubjedt to M.\nDeflon, who replied, that the experiment\nF ought\n\f\u00a9tight to fucceed, provided the fubjedt\nwere extremely fufceptible j and it was\nagreed that it fhould be made at Pafly in\nthe prefence of Dr. Franklin. The necef-\nfity that the fubjedt lhould be fufceptible,\nled the commiffioners to conceive, that to\nrender the experiment decifive and unan-\nfwerable, it was necefiary that it fhould be\nmade upon a perfon of M. Deflon's choice^\nand of whofe fufceptibility to the opera\u00ad\ntions of the magnetifm he was already con\u00ad\nvinced. M. Deflon therefore brought\nwith him a boy of about twelve years of\nagean apricot tree was fixed upon in the\norchard of Dr. Franklin's garden, confi-\nderably diftant from any other tree, and\ncalculated for the prefervation of the mag-\nnetical power which might be impreffed\nupon it. M. Deflon was led thither alone\nto perform the operation, the boy in the\nmean time remaining in the houfe, and\nanother perfon along with him.. We\ncould have wifhed that M. Deflon had not\nbeen prefent at the fubfequent part of the\nexperiment, but he declared that he could\nnot anlwer for its fuccefs, if he did not\ndire\u00a3l his cane and his countenance to\u00ad\nwards the tree, in order to augment the\nadtion of the magnetifm. It was therefore\nrefolved, that M. Deflon fliould be placed\nat the greatefi: poffible diftance, and that\nfome of thecommiflioners fhould ftand be-\n^ tween\n\ftvveen him and the boy, in order to afcer-\ntain the impradticability of any fignals\nbeing made by M. Deflon, or any intelli\u00ad\ngence being maintained between them.\nThefe precautions in an experiment the\neffence of which muft be authenticity, are\nindifpenfible, without giving the perfon\nwith refpeft to whom they are employeda\nright to think himfelf offended.\nThe boy was then brought into the\n\u2022orchard his eyes covered with the bandage,\nprefented fucceffively to four trees upon\nwhich the operation had not been per\u00ad\nformed, and caufed to embrace each of\nthem for the fpace of two minutes, the\nmode of communication which had been\nprefcribed by M. Deflon himfelf.\nM. Deflon, prefent, and at a confider-\nable diftance, direded his cane towards the\ntree which had been the objeft of his\noperations.\nAt the firft tree the boy being interro\u00ad\ngated at the end of a minute, declared that\nhe perfpired in large drops j he coughed,\nfpit, and complained of a flight pain in his\nhead j the diftance of the tree which had\nbeen magnetifed was about twenty feven\nfeet.\nAt the fecond tree he felt the fenfations\nof ftupefadtion and pain in his head; the\ndiftance was thirty fix feet.\nF 2 At\n\fAt the third tree the ftupefadtion and\nhead^ach increafed confiderably.j he faid\nthat he believed he wasapproaching to the\ntree which had been magnetifed the dis\u00ad\ntance was then about thirty eight feet.\nIn fine at the fourth tree which had not\nbeen rendered the objedt of the operation,\nand at the diftance of about twenty four\nfeet from the tree which Had, the boy\nfell into a crifis; he fainted away, his\nlimbs ftiffened, and he was carried to a\nneighbouring grafs-plot, where M. Deflon\nhaftened to his affiftance and recpvered\nhim.\nThe refultof this experiment is entirely\ncontrary to the theory of the animal mag\u00ad\nnetifm. M. Deflon accounted for it by\nobferving, that\" all the trees by their very\nnature, participated of the magnetifm, and\nthat their magnetifm was belide reinforced\nby his prefence. But in that cafeaperfon\nfenfible to the power of the magnetifm,\ncould not hazard a walk in a garden with\u00ad\nout therifkofconvulfions;an aflertioncon\u00ad\nfuted by the experience of every day. The\nprefence of M. Deflon had no greater in\u00ad\nfluence here, than in the coach, in which\nthe boy came along with him, was placed\noppolite to him, and felt nothing. If he\nhad experienced no fenfation even under\nthe tree \\vhich. was magnetifed, it might\nhave been faid that at leaft upon that day\n\fhe had not been fufficiently fufceptible':\nbut the boy fell into a crifis under a tree\nwhich was not magnetifed; the crifis was\ntherefore the effect of no phyfical or ex\u00ad\nterior caufe, but is to be afcribed folely to\nthe influence of imagination. The expe\u00ad\nriment is therefore entirely conclufive: the\nboy knew that he was about to be led to a\ntree upon which the magnetical operation\nhad been performed, his imagination was\nftruck, it was exalted by the fucceffive\nfteps of the experiment, and at the fourth\ntree it was raifed to the height neceffary\nto produce the crifis.\nOther experiments were made calculat\u00ad\ned to fupport this, and the refult was the\nfame. One day when the commiflioners\nwere all together at Pafly at the houfe of\nDr. Franklin, and M. Deflon with them,\nthey previoufly intreated the latter to bring\nfome of his patients with him, feledting\nthofe of the lower clafs, who were moll\nfufceptible to the magnetifm, M. Deflon\nbrought two women; and while he was\nemployed in performing the operation\nupon Dr. Franklin and feveral perfons in\nanother apartment, the two women were\nfeparated, and placed in different rooms.\nOne of them, dame P\u2014\u2014, had films\nover her eyes; but as fhe could always fee\na little, the bandage already defcribed was\nemployed. She was perfuaded that M,.\nF 3 Deflon\n\ft 7\u00b0 ]\nDeflori had been brought into the room to\nperform the magnetical operation ; filence\nwas recommended; three commiffioners\nwere prefent, one to interrogate, another\nto make minutes of the tranfa&ion, and\nthe third to perfonate M. Deflon. The\ncOnverfation was pretended to be addreffed\nto M. Deflon; he was defired to begin the\noperation j the three commiffioners in the\nmean time remained perfectly quiet and\nfolely occupied in obferving her fymptoms.\nAt the end of three minutes the: patient\nbegan to feel a nervous ihuddering; fhe\nhad then fucceffively a pain in the back of\nher head, in her arms, a creeping in her\nhands, that was her expreffion, flie grew\nftiff, ftruck her hands violently together,\nrofe from her feat, ftamped with her feet:\nthe crifis had all the regular fymptoms.\nTwo other commiffioners, who were in\nthe adjoining roorn with the door fhut,\"\nheard the ftamping of the feet and the\nclapping of the hands, and without feeing\nany thing were wjtnefles to this noify ex\u00ad\nperiment.\nThe two commiffioners we have men\u00ad\ntioned were with the other patient, made-\nmoifelle B who was fubjeit to ner\u00ad\nvous diitempers, No bandage was em\u00ad\nployed upon her, but her eyes were at li\u00ad\nberty y \u00a3he was feated with her face to^\nwards \u00bb door which was fhut, and; per-\nfuaded\n\ff 7l I\nfuadedthat M. Deflon was on the other\nfide, employed in performing upon her the\nmagnetical operation. This had fcarcely\ntsaken place a minute, before fhe began to\nfeel thefymptom of fhuddering; in another\nminute fhe had a chattering of the teeth\nand an univerfal heat j in fine in the third\nminute (he fell into a regular crifis. Her\nrefpiration was quick, fhe ftretched out\nboth her arms, behind her back, twifting\nthem extremely,; and bending her body\nforward : her whole body trembled; the\nchattering of her teeth became fo loud that\nit might be heard in the open air j fhe bit\nher hand, and that with fo much force,\nthat the marks of the teeth remained per\u00ad\nfectly vifible.\nIt is proper to obferve that neither of\nthefe fubje&s were touched in any .man\u00ad\nner; their pulfe was not even felt, that it\nmight not be poffible to fay that the mag\u00ad\nnetic fluid was communicated ; the crifes\nhowever were complete. The commif-\nfioners, who had been defirous to know\nthe efJedfc of the influence of the imagina\u00ad\ntion, and to appreciate the {hare it might\nhave in the magnetical crifes, had now\nobtained all that they defired. It is im-\npoffible to fee this influence difplayed in a\nclearer or. more incontrovertible manner\nthan in -thefe two experiments. If the\nfubjeftshave declared that their crifes were\nF 4 flronger\n\fWronger in the public treatment, it muft\nbe afcribed to the power of communica\u00ad\ntion pofTeffed by the numerous emotions,\nand that in general everyindividual fymp-\ntom has been increafed by the contem\u00ad\nplation of fimilar fymptoms.\nWe had occafion to try a fecond expe\u00ad\nriment upon dame P , and to expe\u00ad\nrience how much ilie was under the do\u00ad\nminion of her imagination. The expe\u00ad\nriment of the magnetic bafon was propof-\ned : this experiment confifts in difcovering\namong a number of bafons one that has\nbeen magnetifed. They are fucceffively\nprefented to a patient fufceptible to the\nmagnetifmj he ought to fall into a crifis,\nor at leaft to experience fenfible effects,;\nwhen the magnetic bafon is prefented to\nTiim, he ought to be perfectly indifferent\nto all the reft. AM that was neceflary\naccording to the recommendation of M.\nDeflon, was to preferit them to him in the\ndirection of the poles, in order that he who\nprefents the bafon may not himfelf mag-\nnetife the patient, and that there may be\nno other effedt than t'hat of the magnetifm\nof the bafon itfelf.\nDame P-^\u2014 was fent for to the arfenal\nto the houfe of M. Lavoifier, where M.\nDeflon was \u2022 fhe began with falling into a.\ncrifis in the anti-chamber, before fli? hadr\nfeen either thecommiffioners orM, Deflon, \u201e\nand\n\ft 73 1\nand merely from the knowledge fhe had\nthat fhe was about to fee him; a diftin-\nguifhed effedt of the influence of imagi\u00ad\nnation.. '\nWhen fhe had been tolerably recovered,\nfhe.was led into the room deftined for the\nexperiment. Several china bafons were\nprefented to -her which had not been mag-\nnetifed; at the fecond bafon fhe began to\nfeel the ufual fymptoms, andat the fourth\nfell into a complete crifis. It may be ob\u00ad\njected that her actual flate was a ftate of\ncrifis, that it had begun in the anti-cham\u00ad\nber, and was renewed by its own fingle\nenergy; but a circumftance which is deci-\nfive, is that having afked for fomething to\ndrink, the bafon which had been magne-\ntifed by M. Deflon himfelf was prefented\nto her; fhe drank with perfedl calmnefs\nand faid that fhe felt herfelf much better.\nThe bafon and the magnetifm had there\u00ad\nfore failed of their effedt, fince the crifis\nwas tranquilized in the room of being\naugmented.\nSome time after, while M. Majault exa\u00ad\nmined the films (he had over her eyes,, the\nmagnetic bafon was prefented to the back\nof her head, and continued,there for twelve\nminutes; fhe was unconfcious of the ope-,\nration and felt no effedl from it; fhe had\neven at no time been more tranquil, be-\ncaufe her imagination was diverted, and\nfixed\n\ft 74 i\nfixed upon the examination that was mak\u00ad\ning into the diforder of her eyes.\n- The commiffioners were informed that\nwhile this woman had been left alone in\nthe anti-chamber, different perfons unac\u00ad\nquainted with the animal magnetifm had\napproached her, and the convullive emo\u00ad\ntions had recommenced. She was defired\nto obferve that the magnetical operation\nwas not performed upon her; but her\nimagination was ftruck to fuch a degree\nthat Ihe replied: If you did nothing to\nme, I fhould not be in the condition in\nwhich I am. She knew that flie had been\nfent for in order to be made the fubjeft of\nthe experiments; and the approach of any\nperfon towards her, or the flighted: noile\nattracted her attention, excited the idea of\nthe magnetifm and renewed her con-\nvulfions.\nThe imagination, in order to its ailing\nwith confiderable ftrength, has often need\nthat you fliould touch feveral cords at a\ntime. It has a correfpondence with each\nof the fenfes ; and its reaction may be ex\u00ad\npected to be in proportion, both to the\nnumber of fenfes applied to, and of fen-\niations received : the commiffioners were\nled to this obfervation by the following\nexperiment. M. Jumelin had fpoken to\nthem of a young lady, twenty-years of age,\nWhom he \u2022had deprived of the-faculty of\n\f[ 75 3\nfpeech by the influence of the magrietifm;\nthe commiffioners repeated the experiment\nat his houfe, the young lady consented to\nfubmit to it, and to fuffer herfelf to be\nblindfolded.\nThe firfl objedt of the experiment was\nto endeavour to obtain the fame effed:\nwithout performing the operation j but,\nthough in this fituation fhe felt or believed\nfhe felt the effedts of the magnetifm, we\nwere not able to ftrike her imagination,\nwith the force, that was neceflary for the\nfuccefs of the experiment. The operation\nwas then really performed, the bandage\nnot being removed j and the fuccefs was the\nfame. The bandage was then taken away;\nher imagination was now attacked at once\nthrough the different channels of fight and\nhearing, and the effedts were more con-\nfiderable j but though fhe complained of a\nheavinefs in her head, an obftrudtion in\nthe fuperior part of the noftrils, and a\nnumber of the fymptoms which fhe had\nfelt under the operation of M. Jumelin,\nHie did not lofe the faculty of fpeech. She\nobferved herfelf, that the hand by which\nfhe was jnagnetifed in the forehead, ought\nto defcend to.the level of the nofe, recol-\nJedting that that was its fituation at the\ntime in which fhe had felt the lofs of her\nvoice. What fhe demanded was accord\u00ad\ningly performed, and ii^ three quarters of\n2 a mi-\n\fa minute fhe was dumb; nothing wasnow\"\nto be heard from her but low and inarti\u00ad\nculate founds, though the exertion of the\nmufcles of the throat for the formation\nof found, and that of the tongue and the\nlips in order to articulation were vifible.\nThis flate lafted only a minute: it is ob\u00ad\nvious to obferve that, finding herfelf pre-\ncifely in the fame circumftances, the fe-\ndudtion of the underftanding and the ef\u00ad\nfect of that feduftion upon the organs of\nfpeech were the fame. But it was not\nenough that fhe fhould be exprefsly in\u00ad\nformed that fhe was magnetifed, it was\nalfo neceffary that the fenfe of feeingfhould\nyield her a teftimony, ftronger, and capa\u00ad\nble of greater effedts j it was neceffary that\na gefture with which fhe was already ac\u00ad\nquainted fhould re-excite her former\nideas. It fhould feem that this experi\u00ad\nment is admirably calculated to difplay the\nmanner in which the imagination ads, the\ndegrees by which it is exalted, and the\ndifferent exterior fuccours it requires in\norder to its difplaying itfelf in its greateft\nenergy.\nThe power, which the fenfe of fight\nexercifes over the imagination, explains\nthe* effects attributed by the do&rine of\nthe magnetifm to the eyes. The eyes\npoffefs in an eminent degree the power of\nniagnetifing; figns and geftures, as the -\ncom-\n\f[ 77 1\ncomtniffioners were, informed, have com\u00ad\nmonly no effedt, except upon a fubje<\u00a3t\nwho has been previoufly- mattered by the\nemployment of the eyes. The reafon of\nthis is very limple; it is the eyes that con\u00ad\nvey the moll energetic expreffions of paf-\niion, it is in them that is developed all that-\nthe human charadter has of the command\u00ad\ning or the attractive. It is natural there\u00ad\nfore that the eyes fhould be the fource of\na very high degree of power; but this\npower confifts merely in the aptitude they\npofiefs of moving the imagination,.and\nthat in a degree moreor lefs flrong in pro\u00ad\nportion to the activity of the imagination.\nIt is for this reafon, that the whole\nprocefs of the magnetifm commences\nfrom the eyes of the operator; and their\ninfluence is fo powerful and leaves traces\nfo ftrong and lively, that a woman, newly\narrived at the houfe of M. Deflon, having\nencountered a look of one of his pupils,\nwho had performed the operation upon\nher, juft as fhe was recovering from a\ncrifis, had her eyes fet in her head for three\nquarters of an hour. For a long time fhe\nwas haunted with the remembrance of this\nlook ; flie always faw before her this very\neye fixed to regard her j and fhe bore it\nuninterruptedly in her imagination fleep-\ning as well as waking for three days. .We\nfee from this inftancewhat an imagination\n\u2022 is\n\fE 78 1\nis capable of doing, that can preferve one\nimpreflion for fo long a time, that is, can\nrenew, of itfelf, and by its lingle power,\nthe fame fenfation regularly and without\ninterruption, for three days.\nThe experiments, which we have al\u00ad\nready reported, are uniform in their na\u00ad\nture, and contribute alike to the fame\ndecifion; they authorife us to conclude\nthat the imagination is the true caufe of\nthe effedts attributed to the magnetifm.\nBut the partifans of this new agent will\nperhaps reply, that the identity of effedts\ndoes not always provean identity of caufes.\nThey will grant that the imagination is\ncapable of exciting thefe imprefiions\nwithout the magnetifm:- but they will\nmaintain that the magnetifm is alfo capa\u00ad\nble of exciting them without the imagi\u00ad\nnation. The commiffioners might eafily\ndeftroy, this affertion by applying the\nprinciples of all reafoning, and the laws of\nnatural philofophy: of which the firft, is\nto admit no new caufes without an abfo-\nlute neceffity. When theeffefts obferved\nare capable of having been produced by\na known caufe, and a caufe whofe exifl>\nence other phenomena have already efta-\nblifhed, found philofophy teaches that the\neffedts ought to be afcribed to that-caufe;\nand when on the other hand we are ac\u00ad\nquainted with the difcovery of a caufe\nhitherto\n\fC 79 ]\nhitherto unknown, found philofophy re\u00ad\nquires that its exiftence be made out by\neffedts, which do not belong to a\nknown caufe, and which cannot be\nexplained but by the new caufe. It\ntherefore properly belongs to the partifans\nof the magnetifm, to bring forward other\nproofs, and to difcover effe&s which fliall\nbe entirely ftripped of the illufions of the\nimagination. But as fads are moredemon-\nftrative than reafonings, and as their evi\u00ad\ndence is more univerfally ftriking, the\ncommiffioners have been defirous of efta-\nblifhing by experiment, what the mag-,\nnetifm could do in cafes where the ima\u00ad\ngination had no concern.\nFor this experiment they made choice\nof two rooms, contiguous to each otherf\nand united by a door of communication.\nThe door was taken away, and a frame of\nwood fubftituted in its place, with tranf-\nverfe bars, and covered with a double\ntexture of paper. In one of thefe rooms-\nwas a commiflioner, who undertook to\nmake minutes of the tranfadtion, and a\nlady, who was giyen out to be juft arrived\nfrom the country, and to have a fuit of\nlinen, which fhe wanted to have made up.\nMademoifelle B , a fempflrefs by pro-'\nfeffion, who had been already employed\nin the experiments at Paffy, and whofe\nfenAbility to the magnetifm . was well\nknown,\n\f[ 8o ]\nknown, was fent for. Every thing was\narranged againft her arrival in fuch a man\u00ad\nner, that there was but one feat upon.which\nfhe could place herfelf, and that feat flood\nwithin the frame of the door of commu\u00ad\nnication.\nThe commiffioners were in the other\napartment, and one of them, a phyfician,\nwho had upon former occafions performed\nthe magnetical operation with fuccefs, had\nundertaken to magnetife mademoifelle\nB through the paper partition. It is\na principle in the theory of the magne\u00ad\ntifm that this agent paffes through doors,\nwalls, &c. A partition of paper could\ntherefore be no pbftacle; befide M.Deflon\nhad pofitively declared that the magnetifm\npaffes through paper. '\nMademoifelle B * was accordingly\nmagnetifed during half an hour, at the\ndiftance of a foot and an half, and in a di\u00ad\nrection oppofite to that of the poles, in\nconformity to the rules taught by M.\nDeflon, and which the commiffioners had\nfeen pradtifed at his houfe. During the\noperation fhe converfed with much gaiety,\nand, in anfwer to an enquiry concerning\nher health, fhe readily replied, that fhe\nwas perfe&ly well: at PafTy fhe had fallen\ninto a crifis in thecourfeof three minutes;\nin the prefent inftance fhe Underwent the\noperation of the magnetifm without any\neffedt\n\f[ 8i }\neffedt for thirty minutes.- The only rea-\nion of this difference muft be that here fhe\nwas'ignorant of the operation, and that at\nPalTy (he thought it had been performed..\nThe inevitable conclufion is, that the\nimagination fingly produces all the effedts\nattributed to the magnetifm, and that,\nwhere the imagination ceafes to be called\nforth, it has nolonger the fmalleflefficacy;\nOnly one objection can be fuggefted to\nthis experiment j it is that mademoifelle \u2022\nB might not be prepared to receive\nthe magnetic fluid, and might be lefs fuf-\nceptible to its operation than ufual. The\ncommiffioners forefaw this objection, and\nfor that reafon made the following experi\u00ad\nment. As foon as they had ceafed1 to\nmagnetife the patient through the paper\npartition, the fame commiffioner palled\ninto- the other apartment; he found no\ndifficulty in engaging mademoifelle B\u2014\u2014-\nto fubmit to the magnetical operation. It\nwas accordingly repeated in precifely the\nfame manner as in the former inflance, at\nthe diftance of a foot and an half, and by\nthe intervention of gestures only, together\nwith the employment of the right finger\nand the rod of iron. If he had applied\nthe hands, and touched the hypochonders,\nit might have been objected that anydiffe\u00ad\nrence of effeft, was to be afcribed to the\napplication having been moreimmediate in\nG the\n\fr. 82 ]\nthe latter inftance. . But the only diffe\u00ad\nrence between the two experiments was,\nthat in the former mademoifelle B\u2014\u2014\nwas magnetifed in a diredtion oppofite to\nthat of the poles, and conformable to the\nrules of the magnetical theory j and in the\nfecond fhe was magnetifed in the diredtion\nof the poles, or in the tranfverfe line. On\nthis account according to the principles of\nthe magnetifm no effedt ought to have\nbeen produced;\nIn three minutes however (he felt a\nfenfation of deje<5tion- and fuffocation ; to\nthefe fucceeded an interrupted hiccup, a\nchattering of the teeth, a contradtion of\nthe throat, and an extreme pain in, her\nhead; fhe was reftlefs in her chair; fhe\ncomplained of a pain in the loins; now and\nihen \/he ftruck her foot with extreme\n-quicknefs on the floor; afterwards (he\nftretched her arms, behind her, twifting\nthem extremely as at Paffy; in a word the\nconvulfive crifis was complete and accom\u00ad\npanied with all the regular fymptoms.\n\u2022All thefe accidents appeared in confequence\nof a procefs of twelve minutes, though\nthe: fame procefs employed for thirty mi\u00ad\nnutes a little before had been ineffectual.\nThe. only ground of difference that re\u00ad\nmains, is the play that \\fcas afforded in the\nlatter inftance to the imagination; to this\nthere-\n\fr ]\ntherefore the difference of the effedts is to\nbe a\/cribed.\nIf the crifis originated in the influence\nof the imagination, it was the imagination\nalfo that put a flop to it. The commif-\nfioner who magnetifed her, obferved that\nit was time to have done j at the fame time\nprefenting to her his two forefingers in\nthe form of a crofs and it is propel to\nobferve that in fo doing he magnetifed her\nin the.direction of the poles, in the fame\nmanner as he had done through the whole\nexperiment; no adtual alteration had there\u00ad\nfore been made, and the procefs being con\u00ad\ntinued, the impreffions ought alfo to have\ncontinued. Butthe declaredintention of the\noperator was fufficient to diffipate the cri\u00ad\nfis ; her heat and the pain in her head Were\nimmediately alleviated. The diforder of\nher frame was in this manner followed\nfrom place to place, announcing at the\nfame time that it was going to difappear.\nIn this manner in obedience to the voice\nto which the imagination was fubjedted,\nthe contraction of the throat ceafed, then\nthe accidents of the bread, laftly thofe of\nthe ftomach and the arms. The whole\nrequired only three minutes j after which\nmademoifelle B \u2014 declared that fhe* no\nlonger felt any fenfation, but was perfectly\nreftored to her habitual ftate.\nG 2 Thefe\n\ft 84 ]\nThefe laft experiments, as well as fev'e-\nral of thofe that were made at the houfe df\nM. Jufnelin, have the double advantage of\ndemonftrating at once the efficacy of the\nimagination, and the impotence of the\nmagnetifm, in regard of the fymptoms\nwhich were operated.\nIf the fymptoms are more confiderable\nand the crifes more violent at the public\nprocefs, it is becaufe various caul'es are\ncombined with the imagination, to ope\u00ad\nrate, to multiply and to enlarge its effedts.\nThey begin with fubduing the minds of\nthe patients by the employment of the\neyes* this is followed by the touch, the\napplication of the hands; it is proper to\ndevelop in this place the phyfical effe&s of\nthis method of procedure.\nThe fymptoms are more or lefs confider\u00ad\nable: thelefs are hiccuphings,qualms of the\nitomach and purgings; the greater are the\nconvulfions to which they have given the\ndenomination of crifes. The parts upon\nwhich the touch is employed, are the hy-\npochonders, the pit of the ftomach, and\niometimes the ovaria, when the patient is a\nwoman. The hands and the fingers are\nprelled with a greater or lefs ftrefs upon\nthefe different regions.\nThe colon, one of the larger inteftines,\nruns through both the ' regions of the\nhypochonders, and the region of the epi-\n.gaftrium\n\fgaftrium which feparates them..It is placed\nimmediately under the integuments. . It is\ntherefore upon this inteftine that the pref-\nfure falls, an inteftine full of fenfibility\nand irritability. A repeated voluntary\neffort, without affiftance from any other\ncaufe, excites the mufcular adtion of this\ninteftine, and fometimes procures evacua\u00ad\ntions. Nature, as it were by inftinit, indi\u00ad\ncates this manoeuvre to perfons hypochon-\ndriacally affetted. The procefs of the\nmagnetifm is nothing more than this very\nmanoeuvre ; and the evacuations it is cal\u00ad\nculated to produce are furtherfacilitated in\nthe magnetical procefs, by the frequent\nand almoft habitual ufe of a real laxative,\nthe cream of tartar in their drink.\nBut while themotion which is produced,\nexcites principally the irritability of the\ncolon, this inteftine offers other pheno\u00ad\nmena. It fwells in a greater or lefsdegree,\nand fometimes diftends itfelf to a con-\nfiderable volume. At fuch times it com\u00ad\nmunicates to the diaphragm fuch an irri\u00ad\ntation, that this organ becomes more or\nJefs convulfed. It is this convulfion to\nwhich they have given the appellation of\ncrifis in the animal magnetifm. One of\nthe commiffioners had occafion to fee a\nwoman, fubjefk to, a kind of fpafmodic\nvomitings,with which ftie wasfeized feveral\ntimes in the courfe of .every day. Hej-\nG 3 efforts.\n\fefforts produced nothing but a turbid and\nvifcous water, fimilar to that which is\nbrought up by the patients in the crifis of\nthe magnetical operation. The convulfion\nhad its feat in the diaphragm, and the\nregion of the colon was fo fenfible, that\nthe ilighteft touch upon that part, a ftrong\ncommotion of the air, the furprife caufed\nby a fudden noife fufficed to excite the\nconvulfion. This woman had therefore\nregular crifes without the affiftance of the\nmagnetifm, by the fingle irritability of the\ncolon and diaphragm; and the \"women\nwho are magnetifed, obtain their crifes\nfrom the fame caufe and through the fame\nirritability.\nThe application of the hands upon the\nftomach has phyfical effects not lefs re\u00ad\nmarkable. The application is made di-\nredtly upon that organ. Sometimes a\nftrong continuous compreflion is operated,\nfometimes a number of flight and fuc-\ncefl^ve compreilions, fometimes a difcom-\npofure of the ftomach by a rotatory motion\nof the rod of iron in contail with the part,\nor by the fucceffive and rapid pafTage of\nthe thumbs over it one after the other.\nThefe methods convey almoft immediately\nto the ftomach an irritation, more or lefs\nftrong and durable, in proportion as the\nfubjedt is more or lefs fufceptible. The\npart is alfo previoufly difpofed for the re\u00ad\nception\n\f[ 87 J\nception of this irritation by being firft\ncompreffed. This compreffion prepares it\nto adt upon the diaphragm and to com\u00ad\nmunicate to it the impreffions it receives.\nIt is irritated, the diaphragm is alfo irri\u00ad\ntated, and from thence refult, in the famd\nmanner as by the adtion of the colon, the\nnervous accidents which had been already\nHated. In women whoare peculiarly fuf-\nceptible, the mere compreffion of the two\nhypochonders, without their being adted\nupon in any other manner, occafions a\ncontradtion of the ftomach and fits of\nfwooning. This happened in the cafe of\nthe .womcin magnetifed by M. Jumelin,\nand it often happens from no other caufe\nthan an improper degree of .tightnefs in\ntheir drefs. Thefe cafes are not followed\nby the crifis, becaufe the ftomach is com\u00ad\npreffed, without being irritated, and the\ndiaphragm remains in its natural Hate.\nThe fame methods employed upon the\novaria in the female fex, befide their par\u00ad\nticular effedts, produce with great force\nthe above accidents. The empire and.ex-\ntenfive influence of the uterus over the\nanimal (Economy is well known.\nThe intimate connection of the colon,\nthe ftomach and the uterus with the dia\u00ad\nphragm is one of the caufes of the effedts\nafcribed to the magnetifm. The regions\nof the lower belly, which are the fubjedt\nQ 4 of\n\fc 8 8 ]\nof thefe.operations, anfwer to the different\nplexufes which conftitute a regular nervous\ncentre in this part, by means of which,\nleaving every particular fyftem out of the\nqueftion, there moft certainly exifts a\nfympathy, communication or correfpon-\ndence between all the parts of the body,\nfuch an adtion and reaftion, that the lenfa-\ntions excited in this centre affedt the other\nparts of the body, and reciprocally a fen-\nfation experienced in any part affedts arid\ncalls into play the nervous centre, which\noften transmits the impreffion back again\nto all the parts of the body.\nThe truth thus ftated not only explains\nthe effedts of. the magnetic touch, but\nalfo the phyfical effects of the imagination.\n,It has been conftantly remarked, that the\naffedtions of the foul make their firft cor\u00ad\nporeal impreffion upon the nervous centre,\nwhich commonly leads their fubjedt to\ndefcribe himfelf as having a weight upon\nhis ftomach, or a fenfation. of fuffocation.\nThe diaphragm enters into this bufinefs,\nfrom whence originate the fighs, the tears\nand the expreffions of mirth. The vifcera\nof the lower belly then experience a re\u00ad\naction ; and it is by this automatous pro-\ncefs that we are enabled to account for the\nphyfical diforders produced by the imagi-?\nnation. Surprife occafions the colic, terror\ncaufes adiarrhoea, melancholy is the origin\n\f[ V3\nof i<5terical diftempers. The hiftory of\nmedicine prefents to us an infinity of ex\u00ad\namples of the power of imagination and\nthe mental affedtions. The terror occa\u00ad\nsioned by a fire, a violent degree of defire,\na ftrorig and undoubting hope, a fit of\n\"choler have reftored the ufe of his limbs\nto one who has been crippled with the\ngout or to a paralytic perfon; a ftrong and\nunlooked for degree of joy has diffipated\na quartan ague of two months ftanding;\nclofe attention isa remedy for the hiccup;\nand perfons, who by fome accident have\nbeen deprived of the faculty 'of fpeech,\nhave recovered it in confequence of fome\nof the vehement emotions of the foul.\nThis lafl: aflertion is fupported by the\nteftimony of hiftory, and the commiffioners\nhave themfelves witnefled a fufpenfion of\nthis faculty, occafioned fingly by the ima\u00ad\ngination. The a\u00a3tion and rea&ion of the\nphyfical upon the moral fyftem, and of the\nmoral upon the phyfical, have been ac\u00ad\nknowledged ever fince the phenomena of\nthe medical fcience have been remarked,\nthat is, ever fince the origin of the fcience.\nTears, laughter, coughs, hiccups, and\nin general all the efFedts which are obferved\nin what have been ftiled crifes in the\nanimal magnetifm, do therefore originate\neither in the interruption of the functions\nof the diaphragm by a phyfical vehicle,\nfuch\n\fI 90 ]\nfuch as the touch and the preflure, or from\nthe power with which the imagination is\npndowed of adting upon this organ and\ninterrupting its functions.\nIf it be objected that the touch is not\nalways neceffary to thefe effects, it may be\nreplied, that the imagination may be fuf-\nficiently fertile in refources to produce\nthem all by its fole instrumentality; efpe-\ncially the imagination exerted in a public\nprocefs, called into play at once by the\nmethods in which it is itfelf addreffed,\nand by the effedts obferved in thofe who\nfurround it. It has been already feen what\nwereits effedts in the experiments made by\nthe cornmiffioners upon ifolated fubjedts;\nit may eafily be conceived in what degree\nthofe effedts muft be multiplied in the cafe\nof a number of patients collected together\nin a public procefs. Thefe patients are\naffembled in a narrow fpace, if the fpace\nbe compared with the number of patients;\nthe air of the apartment is heated, although\ncare be employed to renew it; and it is\nalways more or lefs impregnated with\nmephitic gas, which has the property of\nadting immediately upon the head and\nthe nervous fyftem. When the introduce\ntion of mufic is added, it affords another\nmeans of adting upqn an4 exciting the\nnerves.\nIn\n\f[ 91 3\nJnthe public procefs feveral women are\nmagnetifed at the fame time, and they ex\u00ad\nperience at fir ft no effedts but fuch as are\nlimilar to thofe, obtained by the com-\nmiffioners in various experiments. It is\neven acknowledged that for the moil part\nthe crifes do not commence in lefs than\nthe fpace of two hours. By little and little\nthe impreffions are communicated from,\none to another, and reinforced, in the fame\nmanner as the impreffions which are made\nby theatrical reprefentation, where the im\u00ad\npreffions are greater in proportion to the\nnumber of the fpedtators, and the liberty\n1they enjoy of expreffing their fenfations.\nThe applaufe, by which the emotions of\nindividuals are announced, occafions a ge\u00ad\nneral emotion, which every one partakes\njn the degree in which he is fufceptible.\nThe fanas obfervation has been made in\narmies upon a day of battle, where the\nenthuliafm of courage, a\u00a7 well as the im\u00ad\npreffions.of terror, are propagated with fo\namazing rapidity. The drum, the found\npf the military mufical inftruments, the\npoife of the cannon, the mufquetry, the\nIhouts of the army, and the general diforder\nimprefs the organs, have a uniform effedt\nupon the underftanding, and exalt the\nimagination in the fame degree. In this\nequilibriym of inebriation, the external\nmanifeftatjon of a finale fenfation imrne-\n\fdiately becomes univerfal j it hurries the\nfoldiery to the charge, or it determines\nthem to fly. The fame caufe is deeply\nconcerned in rebellions} the multitude\nare governed by theimaginationj the indi\u00ad\nviduals in a numerous affembly are more\nfubjedted to their jfenfes, and lefs capable\nof fubmitting to the dictates of reafon j\nand where fanaticifm is the prefiding qua\u00ad\nlity, its fruit is the tremblers of the\nCevennes*. It has been ufual to forbid\nnumerous\n* Marflial Villars, who was employed in appeafing\nthe troubles of the Cevennes, fays: u I{aw things in\nthis kind, which I fhould not have believed, if they\n<c had not pafTed before my eyes ; I faw a considerable\n16 town, of which the, whole female part without ex-\ncc ception appeared to be pofiefled by the devil.

But of all thefe abfurdities\n\" the moft furprifing was that, which was related to me\n\" by the bifliop of Alais, and which I wrote to M. de\n\" Chamillard in the following terms.\n\" c A M. de Mandagors, lord of the manor of that\n<l name, mayor of Alais, poflelTjng the firft appoint-\n\" ments in the town and county, and having even been\nu for fome time fubdelegate to M. de Baville, was the\n\" fubjedt of this relation. He was fixty years of age,\n\u00ab temperate in his manners, ppflefTed of a fine under-\nu Handing, and had written and publiflied n>any per-\niC formances. Some of them I have read, and, before\nu I knew what I have juft learned refpe\u00a3ting him, I\nu con fide red* them as diftinguifiied by a very vigorous\nimagination,\n\" c A prophetefs, aged twenty feven or twenty eight\n\/t years, was takeii up about eighteen months ago and\n\"** \" carried\n\f[ 93 1\nnumerous affemblies in feditious, towns*\nas a means of flopping a contagion fo\neafily\ncc carried before the bifhop of Alais. He interrogated\n\" her before feveral ecclefiaftics. The creature, after\n\" having heard what he faid, replied with a modeft air,\n\" exhorted him no longer to torment the true children\n\" of God, and then addrefled him for an entire hour\n\" in an uncouth language of which he could not under-\nu ftand a word: juft as wehave formerlyfeen the duke\n\" de la Ferte, when he had drank a few glafles, talk\n\" Englifh before the inhabitants of that country* I\nu have heard them fay, I underftand very well that he\nfpeaks Englifli, but I cannot comprehend a word\n\" that he fays. It would have been fomewhat difficult\n\" that,they fhould have done fo, for he never knew a\n\" word of Englifli in his life. This girl talked Greek\nw and Hebrew in the ftyle of the duke de la Ferte,\n\" 'You will take it for granted that M. d'Alais\n\" fent the girl to prifon. After feveral months, the\n\" girl appearing to be entirely ridded of her abfurdities\n\" by the attention and advice of the fieur de Mandagors,\n\" who frequently vifited her in her confinement, fhe\n\" wasfet at liberty, and the confequence of that liberty,\nu and of the liberties that the fieur Mandagors had\n\" taken with her, was an immediate pregnancy,\n\" 4 But the fa\u00a3l which I was about to relate is the\n\" refignation made by the. fieur Mandagors of all\n\" his employments in favour of his fon, at the fame\n^ time faying to feveral individuals, and among others\nu to the bifhop, that it was by exprefscommiffion from\n\" God that he had had carnal knowledge of the pro-\n\" phetefs, and that the child which lhould be born\n\" would be the true faviour of the world.

I propofed\n\" previoufly to confer with M. de Baville, intendant of\n\" the province,'ordering in the mean time that he and\n\" the\n\ft 94 3\neafily communicated. Every where ex\u00ad\nample adts upon the moral part of our\nframe, mechanical imitation upon the phy\u00ad\nsical part: the minds of individuals are\ncalmed by difperfing them j the fame\nmethod puts a flop to their fpafmodic\naffedtions, always contagious in their na\u00ad\nture : we have had a recent example of\nthis in the young ladies of Saint Roch,\nwho were in this manner cured of the\n\" the prophetefs (hould be clofely watched,fo that they\n\u00abc might not be able to efcapc. My opinion was, that,\na in the midft of a country of madmen, what relates to\nu a madman of fuch importance ought to make aslittle\n\u00ab hoifc as poffible ; and that it was therefore neceflary\ncc to endeavour to get him out of the country by gentle\n\" means, and then to take him into Cuftody. Your\ntc lordfhip will eafily conceive that to declare publicly\n\" for a prophet a mayor of Alais, the lord of anexten-\n<c five manor, an ancient fubdelegate of the intendant,\n\u00ab an author, and a man hithertoefteemed for his pene-\ncc tration and fagacity, in the midft of a country ac-\n\" cuftomed to venerate and refpe\u00a3t him, was a meafure\nbetter calculated to revolt the minds of the inhabi-\ntants than to correft them. It would the rather\nu have had this tendency, that, except the follyof be- .\n\" lieving that God had commanded him tohave carnal\n\" knowledge of this young woman, his converfation is\nas full of reafon and good fenfe, as was that of Don\n\" Quixote upon all other fubje&s but that of knight-\n\" errantry. M. de Baville was of my opinion. The\nchildren of M.

The\nbucket is furrounded with a crowd of\npatients; the fenfations are continually\ncommunicated and recomriiunicated it\n* On the day of the ceremony of the firft com\u00ad\nmunion, celebrated in the parifh church of Saint Roch\na few years ago (1780), after the evening fervice they\nmade according to cuftom the proceffion through the\nftreets. Scarcely were the children returned to the\nchurch, and had refumed their feats, before a young girl\nfell ill and had convulfions. This affection propagated\nitfelf with fo much rapidity, that in the fpace of half an\nhour fifty or fixfy girls from twelve to nineteen years,\nof age were feized with the fame convulfions; that is,\nwith a contra&ioh of the throat, an inflation of the\nftomach, fuffocation, hiccups and fpafms more or lefs\nconfiderable. Thefe accidents reappeared in fome in-\nftances in the courfe of the week $ but the following\nSunday, being afiembled with the dames of Sainte Anne,\nwhofe bufinefs itis. to teach the young ladies, twelve of\nthem were feized with the fame convulfions, and more\nwould have followed, if they had not had the precaution\nto fend away each child upon the fpot to her relations.\nThe whole were obliged to be divided into feveral\nfchools. By thus feparating the children, and not\nkeeping them together but 111 fmall numbers, three\nweeks fufHced to diflipate entirely this epidemical con-^\nvulfive affe&ion.

Immediately the cords,\nevery where ftretched to the fame degree\nand in perfect unifon,' refpond to each\nother j the crifes\" are multiplied ; they\nmutually reinforce each other, and are\nrendered violent. In the mean time the\nmen, who are witnefles of thefe emotions,\npartake of them in proportion to their\nnervous fenfibility; and thofe with whom\nthis fenfibility is greateft and moft eafily\ncxcited become themfelves the fubjedts of\na crifis.\nThis propenfity to irritation, partly na^\ntural and partly acquired, becomes in each\nfex habitual. The fenfations having been\nfelt once or oftener,-nothingis now necef-\nfary, but to recal the memory of them, and\ntoexalt the imagination to the lame degree,\nin order to operate the fame efFedts. This\nwill never be difficult when the fubjedt is\nplaced in the fame circumftances. The\npublic procefs is no longer neceffary, you\nhave only to touch the hypochonders and\nto condudt the finger and the rod of iron\nbefore the countenance; the figns are well\nknown. Even thefe are not neceflary, it\nis fiifficient that the patients be blind\u00ad\nfolded, made to believe that thefe figns are\nrepeated\n\ft 97 3\nrepeated upon them, and that they are\nmagnetifed; the ideas are reexcited, the\nfenfations are reproduced, the imagination,\nemploying its accuftomed inftruments and\nrefuming its former routes, gives birth to\nthe fame phenomena. Thefe cafes happen\nexactly to the patients of M. Deflon, who\nfall into a crifis without the bucket, and\nwithout being excited with the fpedtacle\nof the public procefs.\nCompreffion, imagination, imitation are\ntherefore the true caufes of the effects at\u00ad\ntributed to this new agent, known by the\nappellation of animal magnetifm, this fluid,\nwhich is faid to circulate through the\nhuman body, and to be communicated from\nIndividual to individual. Such is the refult\nof the experiments of the commiffioners,\nand the obfervations they made upon the\nmeans employed and the effedts produced.\nThis agent, this fluid has no exiftence.\nChimerical however as it is, the idea is\nby no means novel. Some authors, par\u00ad\nticularly phyficians of the laft age, have\nexprefsly treated of it in various perform\u00ad\nances, The curious and interesting en\u00ad\nquiries of M. Thouret have convinced the\npublic, that the theory, the operations and\nthe eflfe&s of the animal magnetifm, pro-,\npofed in the laft age, were nearly the fame\nwith thofe revived in the prefent.

The theory indeed 15. now.pre-*\nfented, p was neceflary in a more en\u00ad\nlightened age, with a greater degree of\npomp but it is not lefs erroneous. Hu\u00ad\nman nature is formed to feise, to quit*\nand to refume the miftake which is flatter\u00ad\ning to its wifhes. There are errors which\nwill be eternally dear tothe fubluiiary ftate.\nHow pfteri has the pretended fcience of\naflrology vanifhed and reappeared ! The\nmagnetifm is calculated to lead us back to\njt. Its profeffors have been defirous of\nconnecting it with the celeftial influences,,\nthat it might have the ftronger fedu\u00a3tion,\nand attraft mankind by the two hopes that\nare neareft their heart, that of looking into\nfuturity, and that of prolonging their\nexiilence.\nThere is room to believe that the imagi\u00ad\nnation is the principal of the three caufes\nwhich we have affigped to the magnetifm^\nIt appears by the experiments we have re\u00ad\nlated that it fuffices alone to produce the\ncrifes. The preflure and the toCich feem\nto ferve it as preparatives y it is by the\ntouch that the nerves begin to be excited,\nimitation communicates and extends the\nimpreflions. But the imagination is that\nadtive and terrible power, by which are\noperated the aftonifhing effects, that have\nexcited fo .much attention to the public\nprocefs. The effe&s, ftrike all the world,\n\" \" \" ' the\n\f[ 99 3\nthe caufe is enveloped in the fhades of\n\"obfcurity. When we confider that thefe\neffe\u00a3ts feduced in former ages menj vene^\n!*able for their merit, their illumination\n.and even their genius, Paracelfus, Van\nHelmont and Kircher^ we ceafe to be\naftonifhed, that perforts of the prefent day^\nlearned and well informed, that even a great\nnumber of phyfieians have been the dupes\nof this fyftem. Had the commiflioners\nbeen admitted only to the public procefs*\nwhere there is neither time nor oppor\u00ad\ntunity of making decilive experiments,\nthey might themfelves have been led into\nerror. It was neceflary to have liberty to\ninfulate the effedts, in order to diftinguifli\nthe caufes; it was neceflary to fee as they\n\u2022have done the imagination aft, if we may\nbe allowed the expreffion, partially., and\nproduce its effe6ls one by on6 and in\n.detail, to have an idea to what the accumu\u00ad\nlation of thofe effects might amount j to\nconceive the extent of its powers and to\naccount for all its prodigies. Such an ex\u00ad\namination demanded a facrifice of time,\nand a number of fyftematical refearches,\nwhich we have not always the leifure to\nUndertake for our private inftru\u00a3tion or\nprivate curiofity, nor even the power pro\u00ad\nperly to purfue without being like the\ncommiflioners charged with the mandates\nHz \u2022 of\n\fof the fovereign, and honoured with the\nconfidence of the public.\nM. Deflon'is not much averfe to the\n. admiffion of thefe principles. He declared\nin our feffion held at the houfe of Dr.\nPranklin the 19thof June, that he thought\nhe might lay it down as a fa\u00a3l, that the\nimagination had the greateft fhare in the\neffedts of the animal magnetifmj he faid\nthat this new agent might be no other\nthan the imagination itfelf, whofe power\nis as extenfive as it is little known : he\naffirmed that he always acknowledged the\nconcern of this faculty in the treatment of\nhis patients, and he affirmed with equal\nconfidence that many perfons* have been\neither entirely cured or infinitely amended\nin the Hate of their health under his di\u00ad\nrection- He remarked to the commiffioners\nthat the imagination thus directed to the\nrelief of fuffering; humanity, would be a.\nmoll valuable means in the-hands of the\nmedical profeffion* and perfuaded of the\n* M. Deflon had already faid in 1780. \"Granting\nfor a moment that M. Mefmer poflefles no other\nfecret than that of employing the imagination in the\ntc extenfive produ&ion of the moft falutary effefts, will\nit not ftill be true, that his invention is an extremely\nvaluable one? For.in reality, if the phyfic of the\n\" imagination be more falutary than the other kinds\nof medicine, what good reafon can be alledged, why\n44 the phyfic of the imagination fliould not be brought\n\" into general ufe ?\" Obfervations on the Animal\nMagnetifm, pages 46 and 47I\nreality\n\f[ idi ]\nreality of the power of the imagination^\nhe invited the commiffioners to embrace'\nthe opportunity which his pradtite af\u00ad\nforded to ftudy its procedure and its efFedts.\nIf therefore M. Deflon be ftill attached to\nhis fir ft idea, that thefe'effedts are to be\n-afcribed to the agency of a fluid, which is\ncommunicated from individual to indi\u00ad\nvidual by the touch or under the guidance\nof a condudlor, he cannot however avoid\nconceding to the commiffioners that only\none caufe is requifite to one efFedt, and\nthat fince the imagination is a fufficient\ncaufe, the fuppofition of the magnetic fluid\nis ufelefs. It cannot be denied that we\nare furrounded with a fluid which peculi\u00ad\narly belongs to us ; the infenfible perfpi-\nration forms around us an atmofphere of\ninfeniible vapours: but this fluid has no\nagency but fuch as is common to other\natmofpheres j cannot be communicated\nby the touch but in infinitely fmall quan\u00ad\ntities ; is not capable of being directed\neither by condudtors, or by the eyes, or\nby the will; is neither propagated by\nfound, nor refledted by mirrors j and is in\nno cafe fufceptible of the efFedts afcribed\nto it.\nIt remains for us to enquire, whether\nthe crifes or convulfions, excited by the\nmethods of the pretended magnetifm in\nthe affemblies round the bucket, be capable.\nof\n\fof any Utility, or be calculated to cure of\nrelieve the patients. The imagihation of\nfick perfons has unqueftionably a very\nfrequent and confiderable fliare in the cure\nof their difeafes. With the efFedt of it\nwe are unacquainted otherwife than by\ngeneral experience j but, though it has\nnot been traced in pofitive experiments*\nit fhould feem not to admit of a reafonable\ndoubt. It is a known adage, that in phyfic\nas well as religion, men are faved by faith j\nthis faith is the produce of the imagina\u00ad\ntion : in thefe cafes the imagination adts\nby gentle means; it is by diffufing tran\u00ad\nquility over the fenfes, by reftoring the\nharmon^ of the functions, by recalling\ninto play every principle of the frame\nunder the genial influence of hope* Hope\nis an elTential conftituent of human life %\nthe ,man that yields us one contributes to\nreftore to us the other* But when the\nimagination produces convulfions> the\nmeans it employs are violent; and fuch\nmeans arealmofl always deftrufiive. There\nare indeed a few rare cafes in which they\nmay be ufeful; there are defperate dif\u00ad\neafes, in which it is neceflary to overturn\nevery thingfor the introduction of an order\ntotally new. Thefe critical (hocks are to\n\u2022be employed in the medical art in the\nfame manner as poifons. It is requifite\nthat neceffity fhould demand,and ceconomy\nemploy\n\fI i\u00b03 3\nemploy them. The need of them Is mo\u00ad\nmentary ; the fhock ought to be fingle,.\nVery far from repeating it, the intelligent\nphyfician exerts himfelf toinvent the means\nof repairing the indifpenfible evil which\nhas thus been produced j but in the public\nprocefs of the magnetifm the crifes are\nrepeated every day, they are long and vio\u00ad\nlent. Now fince the ftate introduced by\nthefe crifes is pernicious, the habit cannot\nbe other than fatal. How indeed can it\nbe conceived, that a woman, attacked for\ninftance with a pulmonary diftemper, can\nyndergo with impunity a crifis, fome of\nwhofe fymptoms are a convuliive cough and\ncompulfory expe&orations; or can fafely\nfatigue, perhaps fhatter the lungs by violent\nand repeated efforts, when fo great pains are\nneceffary to convey to the wounded frame\nthe fanative and the balfamic ? How can\nwe imagine that a man, be his diforder\n\\vhat it will, can need in order to his re\u00ad\ncovery the intervention of crifes, in which\nthe fight appears to be loft, the members\nftiffen, he firikes his breafh with precipi\u00ad\ntate and involuntary motions; crifes in a\nword, that are terminated by an abundant\nfpittingof vifcous humours and evenblood ?\nThe blood thus difcharged is neither\nvitiated nor corrupted, it flows from vef- .\nfels from which it is torn by the violence\nof effort and contrary to the intention of\nnature;\n\f[ io4 ]\nnature; thefe efFedts are therefore to be\nregarded as a real not a falutary evil, an\nfevil additional to the diftemper be it what\nit will.\nNor is this the only danger with which\nthey are attended. Man is inceffantly\nenflaved by cuftomj nature is modified by\nhabit only in a progreflive manner, yet {he\nis often fo completely modified, as to fuffer\nan entire metamorphofis, and to be fcarcely\ncapable of being known for the fame.\nWho will allure us that this ftate of crifes,\nat firft voluntarily induced, fhall not be\u00ad\ncome habitual ? And fhould the habit thus\ncontradted frequently reproduce the fame\nfymptoms, in fpite of the will, and almoft\nwithout the affiftance of the imagination,\nhow dreadful the fate of an individual,\nfubjedted to fo violent effedts, tormented,\nas well morally as phyfically, with their\nunfortunate imprefiion, whofe days (hould\nbedivided between apprehenfionand agony,\nand whofe life fhould be an uninterrupted\nftate of fufFering! Nervous diftempers of\nthis defcription, even when natural, are\nthe opprobrium of the medical fcience j\nhow little ought it to be the objedt of art\nto produce them! The art, which thus\ninterferes with all the functions of the ani\u00ad\nmal ceconomy, urges nature out of her\nproper courfe, and multiplies the vidtims\nof irregularity, is to be regarded as perni-.\n\u2022 ' cious,,\n\f[[ to5 ]\nclous.- Its effedls are.the more to be ap\u00ad\nprehended,-fince it not only aggravatessthe\ndiforder of; the nerves by renewing their\nfymptoms, 'and caufing them to degene\u00ad\nrate into habit; but if a diftemper of this\nkind be contagious, as it may be fufpe&ed\nto be; the method of provoking nervous\nconvulfions and of exciting them in pub\u00ad\nlic affemblies is a means to diffufe them in\ngreat towns, and even to affliit.with them\ngenerations to come, fince thedifeafes and\nthe; habits of parents iare tranfmitted to\ntheir pofterity. \u2022 : - ;\nThe commiffioners having convinced\nthemfelves, that the animal magnetic fluid\nis capable of being perceived by none of\nour fenfes, and had no adtion either upon\nthemfelves or upon the fubje\u00a3ts of their\nfeveral experiments; being allured, that the\ntouches.and compreffions employed in its\napplication rarely occafioned favourable\nchanges in the animal ceconomy, and that\nthe impreffions thus made are always hurt\u00ad\nful to the imagination j in fine having de-\nmonftrated by decifive experiments, that\nthe imagination without the magnctifm\nproduces convulfions, and that the mag-\nnetifm without the imagination produces\nnothing; they have concluded with an\nunanimous voice refpefting the exiftence\nand the utility of the magnetifm, that the\nexiftence of the fluid is abfolutely deftitute\nI of\n\fof proof, that the fluid having no exiftence\ncan confequently have no ufe, that the\nviolent fymptoms obferved in the public\nprocefs are to be afcribed to the compref-\nfion, to the imagination called into adlion,\nand to that propenfity to mechanical imi\u00ad\ntation, which leads us in fpite of ourfelves\nto the repetition of what ftrikes our fenfes.\nAnd at the fame time they think them-\nfelves obliged to add as an important ob-\nfervation, that the comprefiions and the re\u00ad\npeated action of the imagination employed\nin producing the crifes may be hurtful,\nthat the fight of thefe crifes is not lefs\ndangerous on account of that imitation\nwhich nature feems to have impofed upon\nus as a law, and that of confequence every\npublic procefs, in which the means of the\nanimal magnetifm ftiall be employed, can\u00ad\nnot fail in the end of producing the mof|\npernicious effedts*.\nParis,\n* If it be obje\u00a3ed to the commiflioners that this de-\ncifion concludes refpe&ing, the magnetifm in general,\ninftead of relating fingly to the magnetifm pradtifed by\nM. Deflon, the commiflioners reply that the inten\u00ad\ntion of the king was to have their opinion upon the\nanimal magnetifm, and that in confequence they have\nnot exceeded the bounds of their commiffion. Agaiij\nthey reply that M. Dellon has appeared to them ac^\nquainted with what are called the principles of the mag-,\nnetifm, and thathe certainly poffefles the means of pro-,\nducing the effects and exciting the crifes which are\nafcribed to it.\n\f[ io7 1\nParis, the nth day of Auguft, 1784,\n(Signed) B. FRANKLIN,\nMAJAULT,\nLE Roy,\nSALLIN,\nBAILLY,\nD'ARCET,\nPE BORY,\nGUILLOTIN,\nLAVOISIER.\nThe principles of M, Deflon are the very fame with\nthofe included in the twenty feven propofitions difle-\nminated from the prefs by M. Mefmer in 1779. If M,\nMefmer now announces a more extenfive theory, it was\nnot necefiary for the commiflioners to be acquainted\nwith the theory to decide upon the exiftenceand utility\nof the magnetifm, it was fufficient to eftimate the ef\u00ad\nfects. It is by the effe&s that the exiftence of a caufe\nis eftablifhed, it is by the effe\u00a3ts alfo that its utility muft\nbe demonftrated. The phenomena are learned from\nobfervation long before we can arrive at the theory\nwhich connects and explains them. The theory of the\nloadftone does not yet exift, and its phenomena are\nafcertained by the experience of fucceffive ages. The\ntheory of M. Mefmer is in this cafe indifferent and fu-\nperfluousj the methods employed, the effects produced,\nthis is what it was neceflary to examine. Now it is\neafy to prove that the eflential practice of the magnetifm\nis known to M, Deflon.\nJVL Deflon was for many years the pupil of M. Mef^\nmer. Conftantly during that time he faw the procefs\nof the animal magnetifm, and the means employed in\nexciting and directing it. M. Deflon himfelf admi-\nniftered the magnetifm in the prefence of M. Mefmer;\nfeparated from him he operated the fame effe&s. Being\nafterwards reconciled they-united their patients; the\none\n\f[ ;io8 Y\none' and the other without diftin&ion undertook the\nmanagement of them, and of confequence the methods\nwere the fame, i The method which is followed at this\nday byrMvipeflon can be no other thah the method of\nM. J^lefmer. ;\nThe effefts are riot lefs correfpondent. There are\ncrifes equally frequent, and accompanied by fimilar\niymptoms^at the houfe of M, Defion and at the houfe\nof M.M^fmerj theeffe\u00a3ts do not therefore belong to the\nmethod of an individual, butto the practice of the mag-\nnetifm in general. The experiments of the commif-\nfioners- demonftrate that the effects obtained by M*.\nDeflon are due to cpmpreffion, to imaginatipn and toy\nimitation. Thefe are therefore the caufes of the mag\u00ad\nnetifm in general. The obfervations of the commif-\niioners have convinced them that thefe;conyulfiv-e crifes\nand thefe violent means cannot be ufeful in medicine\nany otherwife'than as poifans, and they have judged\nindependent of all theory that wherever itihall,be; the\nobject to excite convulfions they ma.y become habitual\nand pernicious, they may be epidemically ^iffufed, and\neven extend to future generations. n ;; H ,\n1 f The commiffioners were of confequence obliged to\nConclude that not only the meafures i.n a particular\nmode <?f proceeding, but the meafures of the magnetifm^\nin general, might in the end produce, th$ moil perj^i-s\ncious effects. \u2022*' < - - :\\':v : ; \u2022 ,\n:--v: vvA\n;1 ;;T\n; ' \" \u2022 ' \u2022' : \u2022 ; ! , \u2022 ' \u2022 \u2022\u2022 I , ' \u2022,. \u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022 ,\n-'.'V ! i\u00bbI''\u2022 \u2022 :\n''' ^ I VS,\n, ... *\u2022 \u2022\u2022 I , : \u2022'\n. ; \u2022 \" \u2022 : T ! : \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 > \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ' \u2022\u2022 \u2022\ni ; . , \u2022; ..i ' i:\n! : ' , \u2022 ' I V, \\\n' , \u2022_ -i -'; \u2022 ii '';.; i\n' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ' 1 -\u2022 ;; ; ; i\n- '* \u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022>\"' * . \/\n\f","_id":1108}
