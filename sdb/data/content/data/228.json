He further discusses the contribution of psychiatry to psychical research in a book published to mark the centenary of the founding of the SPR.3  Selected Works  Articles\n\nPoltergeist and apparitional haunting phenomena affecting the family and associates of an adolescent girl with well-controlled epilepsy (1972).
