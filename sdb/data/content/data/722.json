He joined with Paul Pillault (1854-1921) and Henri Lormier in founding healing clinics in which he was a \"thaumaturge.\"  The movement's journal was Le Fraterniste, founded in 1910 (q.v.).  After World War I, Pillault, who had increasingly become interested in Antoinisme and what he called \"determinisme divin\" started this journal with Jules Berthelin.  Its subscription list was taken over by Le Fraterniste in 1924.  Mlle Duval, who had been Pillault's secretary, went on to found L'Avenir Spirite in Amiens.  BNF.
