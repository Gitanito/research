[part\nI.\nTHE FIRE WALK.\nBy Andrew Lang.\nThe subject of this paper has, perhaps, nothing to do with\npsychical research. The phenomena described are purely physical,\nnor is there, apparently, much reason to suppose that they have\nany cause in the human mind. But, in history, they have often\nbeen associated with anecdotes of miracles, and with persons who\nhad credit as miracle-workers. These have handled or walked\nthrough fire without any lesion or cautery. Of course, it is conceiv\nable, barely, that in certain abnormal states of mind, men might be\ninsensible to the action of fire. But no such state of mind would\nprevent fire from doing its normal work on the body. Moreover,\nI shall show that fire failed to cauterise the naked feet of a normal\nBritish official, whose mental condition was much as usual.\nThe subject occurs everywhere in history, legend, folk-lore, law and\nearly religion, and yet nobody has thought it worth while to collect\nthe ancient reports and to compare them with well-authenticated\nmodern examples. In Mr. Tylor's celebrated work, Primitive Culture,\nonly one or two casual allusions are made to the theme. \" They built\nthe high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause\ntheir sons and daughters to pass through to Moloch,\" that is, to pass\nthrough the fire, \" whether in ritual or symbolical sacrifice \" (Primitive\nCulture, Vol. II., p. 281). As a supposed rite of purification the\nceremony is again touched upon lightly (Vol. II., p. 429). Again,\n\" The ancient ceremony of passing through a fire, or leaping over\nburning brands, has been kept up vigorously in the British Isles\"\n(Vol. I., p. 85), namely, at the midsummer ceremonies, when it is,\nor was, the custom to jump over, or run through, light fires. Nobody\nwould guess that a rite of passing deliberately, and unscathed, through\novens or furnaces yet exists in Japan, Bulgaria, the Society Islands,\nFiji, Southern India, Trinidad, the Straits Settlements, the Isle of\nMauritius, and, no doubt, in other regions. We must distinguish\nbetween such sportive playing with fire as prevailed recently in these\nisles and the more serious Fire Ceremony of Central Australia, which\ntests endurance, on the one hand, and the apparent contravention of\na natural law, on the other. Again, we must discount the popular\nreply that the hand can be rapidly plunged into molten metal and\n\fxxxvi.] The Five Walk. 3\nwithdrawn without injury, for we do not happen to be concerned\nwith such a brief exposure to heat. Once more, the theory of the\napplication of some unknown chemical substance must be rejected,\nbecause, as we shall prove, there are certainly cases in which nothing\nof the kind is done. Moreover, science is acquainted with no sub\nstance\u2014alum or diluted sulphuric acid, or the like\u2014which will\nproduce the result of preventing cauterisation. Sir William Crookes,\nat least, is not familiar with any such resources of science. His\nevidence as to tire-handling by D. D. Home is familiar, and I\nunderstand that Mr. Podmore can only explain it away by a\nhypothesis of a trick played in a bad light, by means of an asbestos\nglove or some such transparent dodge (Studies in Psychical Research,\npp. 58-59). Perhaps he adds a little \" hallucination \" on the part\nof the spectators. But asbestos and hallucination are out of the\nquestion in the cases which I am about to quote. Home was,\nor feigned to be, in a state of trance when he performed with fire.\nThe seeress of Lourdes, Bernadette, was also in religious contem\nplation when she permitted the flame of a candle to play through her\nclasped fingers (which were unscathed) for a timed quarter of an\nhour. 1 Some Indian devotees, again, aver that they \" meditate \" on\nsome divine being while passing over the glowing embers, and the\nNistinares of Bulgaria, who dance in the fire, are described as being\nin a more or less abnormal mental condition. But even this condition\nis absent in the well-attested Raiatean and Fijian examples, in which,\nalso, no kind of chemical preparation is employed. Finally, where\nsavages are concerned, the hardness of the skins of their feet is dwelt\nupon. But, first, the sole of a boot would be scorched in the circum\nstances, while their feet are not affected ; next, the savages' feet\nwere not leathery (so Dr. Hocken avers) ; thirdly, one of the\nEuropeans who walked through the fire at Rarotonga declares that\nthe soles of his own feet are peculiarly tender. Thus every known\nphysical or conjectured psychical condition of immunity fails to meet\nthe case, and we are left wholly without an ascertained, or a good\nconjectural, \" reason why \" for the phenomena.\nI shall begin with the most recent and the most authenticated\ncases, and work back in time, and in civilisation. Mr. Tregear, the\nwell-known lexicographer of the Maori and the allied Mangarova\nlanguages, lately sent me the twenty-ninth number of The Journal of\nthe Polynesian Society, March, 1899, Wellington, N.Z. Professors\nMax Miiller and Sayce are Honorary Members of the Society, which\nstudies Polynesian languages, customs and conditions. Mr. Tregear\nattests the upright, truth-telling character of the British official, who\n1 Dr. Dozous timed the \"miracle.\" Boissarie, Lourdes, p. 49.\nB 2\n\f4 Andrew Lang. [part\nis the narrator of his own experiment. As the journal is not widely\ncirculated in England, I quote the whole of the brief report.\nTE UMU-TI,\nOB FIRE-WALKING CEREMONY.\nBy Colonel Gudgeon,\nBritish Resident, Rarotonc.a.\nIn this Journal, Vol. II., p. 105, Miss Teuira Henry describes this\nceremony as practised in Raiatea, of the Society Group. We have lately\nreceived from Colonel Gudgeon the following account of his experiences in\nwalking bare-footed across the glowing hot stones of a native oven, made in\nRarotonga by a man from Raiatea. Since the date of the paper quoted, it\nhas come to light that the Maoris of New Zealand were equally acquainted\nwith this ceremony, which was performed by their ancestors. On reading\nColonel Gudgeon's account to some old chiefs of the Urewera tribe, they\nexpressed no surprise and said that their ancestors could also perform the\nceremony, though it has long gone out of practice. \u2014Editors.\nI must tell you that I have seen and gone through the fire ceremony of\nthe Umn-Ti.\nThe oven was lit at about dawn on the 20th of January, and I noticed\nthat the stones were very large, as also were the logs that had been used in\nthe oven for heating purposes.\nAbout 2 p.m. we went to the oven and there found the tohtinga (a\nRaiatea man) getting matters ready, and I told him that, as my feet were\nnaturally tender, the stones should be levelled down a bit. He assented to\nthis, and evidently he had intended to do so, for shortly after, the men with\nvery long poles that had hooks, began to level the stones flat in the oven,\nwhich was some twelve feet in diameter. He then went with his disciple\nand pointed to two stones that were not hot, and instructed him the reason\nwas that they had been taken from a marae, or sacred place.\nHe then unwound two bundles, which proved to be branches of a large-\nleaved Ti (or Dracccna) plucked, it is said, from two of these trees standing\nclose together, and it is said that the initiated can on such occasions see the\nshadow of a woman with long hair, called te varua lino (evil spirit), standing\nbetween the trees. The right hand branch is the first plucked, and it is\nsaid that the branches bend down to be plucked.\nSo much for the Shamanism, and now for the facts.\nThe tohunga (priest) and his tauira (pupil) walked each to the oven, and\nthen halting, the prophet spoke a few words, and then each struck the edge\nof the oven with the ti branches. This was three times repeated, and then\nthey walked slowly and deliberately over the two fathoms of hot stones.\nWhen this was done, the tohunga came to us, and his disciple handed his ti\nbranch to Mr. Goodwin, at whose place the ceremony came off, and they\nwent through the ceremony. Then the tohunga said to Mr. Goodwin, '\" I\nhand my mana (power) over to you ; lead your friends across.\" Now, there\nwere four Europeans\u2014Dr. W. Craig, Dr. George Craig, Mr. Goodwin, and\n\fxxxvi.] The Fire Walk. 5\nmyself\u2014and I can only say that we stepped out boldly. I got across\nunscathed, and only one of the party was badly burned ; and he, it is said,\nwas spoken to, but, like Lot's wife, looked behind him\u2014a thing against\nall rules.\nI can hardly give you my sensations, but I can say this :\u2014that I knew\nquite well I was walking on red hot stones and could feel the heat, yet I was\nnot burned. I felt something resembling slight electric shocks, both at the\ntime and afterwards, but that is all. I do not know that I should recom\nmend every one to try it. A man must have mana to do it ; if he has not,\nit will be too late when he is on the hot stone of Tama-ahi-roa.\nI cannot say that I should have performed this wizard trick had I not\nbeen one of the fathers of the Polynesian Society, and bound to support the\nsuperiority of the New Zealander all over Polynesia,\u2014indeed all over the\nworld. I would not have missed the performance for anything.\nTo show you the heat of the stones, quite half-an-hour afterwards some\none remarked to the priest that the stones would not be hot enough to cook\nthe ti. His only answer was to throw his green branch on the oven, and in\na quarter of a minute it was blazing. As I have eaten a fair share of the ti\ncooked in the oven, I am in a position to say that it was hot enough to cook\nit well.\nI walked with bare feet, and after we had done so, about 200 Maoris\nfollowed. No one, so far as I saw, went through with boots on. I did\nnot walk quickly across the oven, but with deliberation, because I feared\nthat I should tread on a sharp point of the stones and fall. My feet also\nwere very tender. I did not mention the fact, but my impression as I\ncrossed the oven was that the skin would all peel off my feet. Yet all I\nreally felt when the task was accomplished was a tingling sensation not\nunlike slight electric shocks on the soles of my feet, and this continued for\nseven hours or more. The really funny thing is that, though the stones\nwere hot enough an hour afterwards to burn up green branches of the ti,\nthe very tender skin of my feet was not even hardened by the fire.\nMany of the Maoris thought they were burned, but they were not, at\nany rate not severely.\nDo not suppose that the man who directed this business was an old\ntohniiga. He is a young man, but of the Raiatea family, who are hereditary\nfire-walkers.\nI can only tell you it is mana\u2014mana tangata and mana atiia.\nOn this report a few remarks may be offered. (1) No preparation\nof any chemical, herbal, or other sort was applied to the Europeans, at\nleast. (2) \" The handing over the mana\" (or power) was practised by\nHome, sometimes successfully (it is alleged) as when Mr. S. C. Hall's\nscalp and white locks were unharmed by a red-hot coal : sometimes\nunsuccessfully. A clergyman of my acquaintance still bears the\nblister caused when he accepted a red-hot coal from the hand of Home,\nas he informs me by letter. (3) The \" walk \" was shorter than seems\ncommon : only twelve feet, four paces. (4) A friend of Colonel\nGudgeon's was badly burned, and the reason assigned was a good\n\f6 Andrew Lang. [part\nfolk-lore reason, since the days of Lot's wife, of Theocritus, and of\nVirgil : he looked behind. (5) The feeling as if of \" slight electric\nshocks \" is worthy of notice. (6) Colonel Gudgeon clearly believes\nthat a man without mana had better not try, and by mana, here, he\nprobably means \" nerve.\" As we can hardly suppose, in spite of\nHome, that mana, in a supernormal sense, can be \" handed over \" by\none man to another, Colonel Gudgeon's experience seems equally to\nbaffle every theory of \" how it is done.\" Perhaps we can all do it.\nMembers of the Society may make their own experiments. Perhaps\nColonel Gudgeon faced fire in a manner so unusual as a result of Dr.\nHocken's description of the Fijian rite at Mbenga, an isle 20 miles\nsouth of Suva. This account was published in the Transactions of the\nNew Zealand Institute, Vol. XXXI., 1898, having been read before\nthe Otago Institute on May 10th, 1898, and is here reprinted in full\nas follows :\u2014\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE FIJI FIRE CEREMONY.\nBv Dr. T. M. Hocken, F.L.S.\nAmongst the many incidents witnessed during a recent visit to the\ntropical islands of Fiji, probably none exceeded in wonder and interest that\nof which I propose to give some account this evening, and to which may be\napplied the designation of \"fire ceremony.\" It is called by the natives\n\" vilavilaireco.\" In this remarkable ceremony a number of almost nude\nFijians walk quickly and unharmed across and among white-hot stones,\nwhich form the pavement of a huge native oven\u2014termed \" lovo \"\u2014in which\nshortly afterwards are cooked the succulent sugary roots and pith of the\nCordyline terminalis, one of the cabbage trees, known to the Maoris as the\n\"t\u00bb,\" and to the Fijians as the \"masawe.\" This wonderful power of fire-\nwalking is now not only very rarely exercised, but, at least as regards Fiji,\nis confined to a small clan or family\u2014the Na Ivilankata\u2014resident on Bega\n( = Mbenga), an island of the group, lying somewhat south of Suva, aud\ntwenty miles from that capital.\nA small remnant of the priestly order at Raiatea, one of the Society\nIslands, is yet able to utter the preparatory incantation, and afterwards to\nwalk through the fire.\nIt exists also in other parts of the world, as in parts of India, the Straits\nSettlements, West India Islands, and elsewhere. Very interesting accounts\nof the ceremony as seen at Raiatea and at Mbenga are to bo found in the\nsecond and third volumes of the Journal of the Polynesian Society, and in\nBasil Thomson's charming South Sea Yarns. These descriIjtions filled our\nsmall party of three\u2014my wife. Dr. Colquhoun, and myself\u2014with the desire\nto witness it for ourselves, and, if possible, to give some explanation of\nwhat was apparently an inexplicable mystery. Our desires were perfectly\nrealised.\nThe Hon. Mr. A. M. Duncan, a member of the Legislative Council of\nFiji, and agent at Suva of the Union Steamship Company, to whom I\ncarried a letter of introduction from Mr. James Mills, the managing\ndirector of that company, was most courteous and obliging, and promised\n\fxxxvl] The Fire Walk. 7\nhis best efforts in the matter. His energy and ready response succeeded,\nwith the result that a large party from Suva enjoyed such a day as each one\nmust have marked with a red letter.\nIt was necessary to give the natives three days in which to make their\npreparations\u2014constructing the oven and paving it with stones, which then\nrequired heating for thirty-six or forty-eight hours at least with fierce fires\nfed with logs and branches. They had also to gather their stores of food to\nform the foundation of the huge feast whose preparation was to succeed the\nmystic ceremony. During these three days we lost no opportunity of\ncollecting from former witnesses of the ceremony whatever information or\nexplanation they could afford, but with no very satisfactory result : the facts\nwere undisputed, but the explanations quite insufficient. Some thought that\nthe chief actors rubbed their bodies with a secret preparation which rendered\nthem fireproof ; others that life-long friction on the hard hot rocks, coral-\nreefs, and sands had so thickened and indurated the foot-sole that it could\ndefy fire ; but all agreed as to the bonajides of the exhibition. The incident\nrecounted in the Polynesian Journal was also confirmed\u2014where Lady\nThurston threw her handkerchief upon the shoulder of one of the actors,\nand, though it remained there but a few seconds before being picked off by\nmeans of a long stick, it was greatly scorched.1\nThe story or legend attached to this weird gift of fire-walking was told\nus, with some variation, by two or three different people, and it is mainly as\nfollows : A far-distant ancestor of the present inheritors of this power was\nwalking one day when he espied an eel, which he caught, and was about to\nkill. The eel squeaked out, and said, \"Oh ! Tui Na Galita ( = Eng-Galita),\ndo not kill me ; spare me. I am a god, and I will make you so strong in\nwar that none shall withstand you.\" \" Oh, but,\" replied Na Galita, \" I am\nalready stronger in war than any one else, and I fear no one.\" \"Well,\nthen,\" said the eel, \"I will make your canoe the fastest to sail on these\nseas, and none shall come up with it.\" \" But,\" replied Na Galita, \"as it is,\nnone can pass my canoe.\" \"Well, then,\" rejoined the eel, \"I will make\nyou a great favourite among women, so that all will fall in love with you.\"\n\"Not so,\" said Na Galita, \"I have one wife, of whom I am very fond, and\nI desire no other.\" The poor eel then made other offers, which were also\nrejected, and his chances of life were fading fast when he made a final\neffort. \"Oh, Na Galita, if you will spare me, I will so cause it that you\nand your descendants shall henceforth walk through the masawe oven\nunharmed.\" \"Good,\" said Na Galita, \"now I will let you go.\" This\nstory varies somewhat from that told in the Polynesian Journal.2\nThe eventful morning was blazingly hot and brilliant, and the vivid-blue\nsky was without a cloud as we steamed down towards Mbenga in the\ns.8. \" Hauroto.\" Mr. Vaughan, an eminent inhabitant of Suva, who has\ncharge of the Meteorological Department there, was of our party, and\ncarried the thermometer. This was the most suitable for our purpose\nprocurable ; it was in a strong japanned-tin casing, and registered 400\u00b0\nFahr. We had also three amateur photographers.\n1 1 have not seen this account. \u2014A. L.\na See also Mr. Thomson's South Sea Yarns.\u2014A. L.\n\f8 Andrew Lang. [part\nOwing to the numerous coral-reefs and shallows, we finally transhipped\ninto the \" Maori,\" a steamer of much less draught. Approaching the silent\nverdure-clad islet, with its narrow beach of white coral sand, we saw a thin\nblue haze of smoke curling above the lofty cocoanut trees at a little distance\nin the interior, which sufficiently localised the mysterious spot. We now\ntook the ship's boat, and soon, stepping ashore, made our way through a\nnarrow pathway in the dense bush until we came to an open space cleared\nfrom the forest, in the midst of which was the great lovo, or oven.\nA remarkable and never-to-be-forgotten scene now presented itself.\nThere were hundreds of Fijians, dressed according to the rules of\nnature and their own art\u2014that is, they were b'ghtly garlanded here and\nthere with their fantastic lihdikus of grass, ornamented with brilliant\nscarlet and yellow hibiscus flowers and streamers of the delicate ribbonwood.\nThese hung in airy profusion from their necks and around their waists,\nshowing off to advantage their lovely brown glossy skins. In addition,\nmany wore clean white cotton snZks, or pendant loin-cloths. All were\nexcited, moving hither and thither in wild confusion, and making the forest\nring again with their noisy hilarity. Some climbed the lofty cocoa-palms,\nhand over hand, foot over foot, with all the dexterity of monkeys. The\ntop reached, and shrouded amongst the feathery leaves, they poured down a\nshower of nuts for the refreshment of their guests.\nThe celerity with which they opened the nuts was something astonishing,\nand afforded an example, too, as to the mode of using stone implements. A\nstout, strong stick, 3 ft. long, and sharpened at both ends, was driven into\nthe ground, and a few smart strokes upon it soon tore from the nut its outer\nthick covering. The upper part of the shell was then broken off by means\nof a long sharp-edged stone as cleanly and regularly as the lid of an egg is\nremoved with a knife, and then was disclosed a pint of delicious milk, a\nmost welcome beverage on that overpoweringly hot day.\nThe great oven lay before us, pouring forth its torrents of heat from\nhuge embers which were still burning fiercely on the underlying stones.\nThese were indeed melting moments for the spectators. The pitiless noon\ntide sun, and the no less pitiless oven-heat, both pent up in the deep\nwell-like forest clearing, reduced us to a state of solution from which there\nwas no escape. Despite this the photographers took up their stations, and\nothers of us proceeded to make our observations. The lovo, or oven, was\ncircular, with a diameter of 25 ft. or 30 ft. ; its greatest depth was perhaps\n8 ft., its general shape that of a saucer, with sloping sides and a flattish\nbottom, the latter being filled with the white-hot stones. Near the margin\nof the oven, and on its windward side, the thermometer marked 114\u00b0.\nSuddenly, and as if Pandemonium had been let loose, the air was filled\nwith savage yells ; a throng of natives surrounded the oven, and in a most\ningenious and effective way proceeded to drag out the smouldering unburnt\nlogs and cast them some distance away. Large loops of incombustible\nlianas attached to long poles were dexterously thrown over the burning\ntrunks, much after the manner of the head-hunters of New Guinea when\nsecuring their human prey. A twist or two round of the loop securely\nentangled the logs, which were then dragged out by the united efforts of\nscores of natives, who all the while were shouting out some wild rhythmical\n\fxxxvi.] The Fire Walk 9\nsong. This accomplished, the stones at the bottom of the oven were\ndisclosed, with here and there flame flickering and forking up through the\ninterstices. The diameter of the area occupied by those stones was about\n10ft., but this was speedily increased to a spread of loft, or more by a\nsecond ingenious method. The natives thrust their long poles, which were\nof the unconsumable wi-tree (Spondias dulcis), between the stones at\nintervals of perhaps 1ft. A long rope-like liana\u2014tea\u2014previously placed\nunderneath the poles, and 1 ft. or 2 ft. from their extremities, was now\ndragged by scores of lusty savages, with the effect of spreading and levelling\nthe stones. This done, our thermometer was suspended by a simple device\nover the centre of the stones, and about 5 ft. or 6 ft. above them ; but it\nhad to be withdrawn almost immediately, as the solder began to melt and\ndrop, and the instrument to be destroyed. It, however, registered 282\u00b0\nFahr., and it is certain that had not this accident occurred, the range of\n400\u00b0 would have been exceeded, and the thermometer burst.\nDuring all these wild scenes we had seen nothing of the main actors\u2014of\nthe descendants of Na Galita. Doubtless to give more impressive effect,\nthey had been hiding in the forest depths until the signal should be given\nand their own supreme moment arrive. And now they came on, seven or\neight in number, amidst the vociferous yells of those around. The margin\nreached, they steadily descended the oven slope in single file, and walked,\nas I think, leisurely, but, as others of our party think, quickly, across and\naround the stones, leaving the oven at the point of entrance. The leader,\nwho was longest in the oven, was a second or two under half a minute\ntherein. Almost immediately heaps of the soft and succulent leaves of the\nhibiscus, which had been gathered for the purpose, were thrown into the\noven, which was thus immediately filled with clouds of hissing steam. Upon\nthe leaves and within the steam the natives, who had returned, sat or stood\npressing them down in preparation for cooking the various viands which\nwere to afford them a sumptuous feast that evening or on the morrow.\nBut for us the most interesting part of the drama was over, and it only\nremained to review observations and draw conclusions. Just before the\ngreat event of the day, I gained permission to examine one or two of the\nfire-walkers prior to their descent into the oven. This was granted without\nthe least hesitation by the principal native Magistrate of the Rewa district,\nN'Dabea by name, but generally known as Jonathan. This native is of\ngreat intelligence and influence, is a member of the Na Galita Clan, and has\nhimself at various times walked through the fire. On this occasion he took\nno other part in the ceremony than that of watching or superintending it.\nThe two men thus sent forward for examination disclosed no peculiar feature\nwhatever. As to dress, they were slightly garlanded round the neck and\nthe waist ; the pulse was unaffected, and the skin, legs, and feet were\nfree from any apparent application. I assured myself of this by touch,\nsmell, and taste, not hesitating to apply my tongue as a corroborative. The\nfoot-soles were comparatively soft and flexible\u2014by no means leathery and\ninsensible. Thus the two Suvan theories were disposed of. This careful\nexamination was repeated immediately after egress from the oven, and with\nthe same result. To use the language of Scripture, \" No smell of fire had\npassed upon them.\" No incantations or other religious ceremonial were\n\f10 Andrew Lang. [part\nobserved. Though these were formerly practised, they have gradually fallen\ninto disuse since the introduction of Christianity. I did not succeed in\nprocuring the old incantation formula ; doubtless it was similar to that of the\nold Raiatean ceremony, which is given in the second volume of the Polynesian\nSociety's Journal, p. 106.\nWhilst walking through the fire, Dr.Colquhoun thought the countenances\nof the fire-walkers betrayed some anxiety. I saw none of this ; nor was it\napparent to me at either examination. The stones, which were basaltic,\nmust have been white-hot, but due to the brilliance of the day this was not\nvisible.\nVarious natives, being interrogated for an explanation, replied, with a\nshrug, \" They can do this wouderful thing ; we cannot. You have seen it ;\nwe have seen it.\" Whilst thus unable to suggest any explanation or theory,\nI am absolutely certain as to the truth of the facts and the bona fides of the\nactors. A feature is that, wherever this power is found, it is possessed by\nbut a limited few. I was assured, too, that any person holding the hand\nof one of the fire-walkers could himself pass through the oven unharmed.\nThis the natives positively assert.\nMy friend Mr. Walter Carew, for thirty years a Resident Commissioner\nand Stipendiary Magistrate in Fiji, has frequently conversed with Jonathan\n(referred to above), who, whilst withholding no explanation, can give\nnone. He says, \"I can do it, but I do not know how it is done\"; and,\nfurther, that at the time he does not experience any heat or other\nsensation.\nDoes any psychical condition explain these facts, as suggested in Lang's\nModern Mythology ? I certainly did not observe any appearance of trance\nor other mental condition. In connection with this Mr. Carew thinks that\nintense faith is the explanation, and that if this were upset, the descendants\nof Na Galita would be no longer charmed. But it is difficult to see how any\nmental state can prevent the action of physical law. Hypnotism and\namesthetics may produce insensibility to pain, but do not interfere with\nthe cautery.\nMany of the so-called fire miracles are remarkable indeed, but are\nreadily explained, and by no means come within the present category.\nSuch, for instance, as plunging the hand, which is protected by the\ninterposed film of perspiration assuming the globular state of water,\ninto boiling lead. Similarly, many conjuring feats. At the beginning\nof this century an Italian\u2014Lionetti\u2014performed remarkable experiments\n\u2014rubbed a bar of red-hot iron over his arms, legs, and hair, and held\nit between his teeth ; he also drank boiling oil. Dr. Sementini, of\nNaples, carefully examined these experiments, and experimented himself\nuntil he surpassed the fire-proof qualities of his suggestor. He found\nthat frequent friction with sulphurous acid rendered him insensible to\nred-hot iron ; a solution of alum did the same. A layer of powdered\nsugar covered with soap made his tongue insensible to heat. In these\nand similar instances, however, an explanation, though probably not a\nvery sufficient one, has been given, but in that forming the subject of\nthis paper no solution has been offered. Lang's chapter on the \"Fire\nWalk \" should be consulted ; his account of the Bulgarian Nistinares is\n\fxxxvi.] The Fire Walk. 11\nas wonderful and inexplicable as anything here recited. The whole subject\nrequires thorough scientific examination.\nMy next case occurs among a civilised race, the Japanese, and is\nvouched for by Mr. Lafcadio Hearn, an American writer, whose book\nI have not at hand, and by Colonel Andrew Haggard (The Field,\nMay 20th, 1899, p. 724). Colonel Haggard saw the fire-walk done in\nTokio, on April 9th, 1899. The fire was six yards long by six feet\nwide. The rite was in honour of a mountain god. Ablutions in cold\nwater were made by the performers, and Colonel Haggard was told by\none young lady that she had not only done the fire-walk, but had been\n\" able to sit for a long time, in winter, immersed in ice-cold water,\nwithout feeling the cold in the least.\" After some waving of wands\nand sprinkling of salt, people of all ages walked through, not glowing\nstones in this case, but \" red-hot charcoal.\" \" I examined their feet\nafterwards,- they were quite soft, and not a trace of fire upon them.\"\nColonel Haggard says that the rite is \"a very unusual thing\" in\nJapan ; many of the Japanese living in Tokio had never heard of it\nbefore. Colonel Haggard was unable to get any clear answer as to\nwhy the rite is performed. The priest talked something about a good\nGod who had power over the bad element of fire. It is not clear how,\nthe rite being so unusual, two Japanese ladies told Colonel Haggard\nthat they had \" frequently gone through the fiery ordeal.\"\nIf any one is anxious to know the particulars of the rite as\npractised in the isle Mauritius, he may communicate with our police\nofficials there, who annually superintend the performance. Coolies\nfrom southern India do just what is done by Japanese and Fijians.\nOur administration, however, does not permit women to pass through\nthe fire.\nAfter giving these recent examples in Mauritius, Japan, Rarotonga,\nand an isle of the Fijian group, I am obliged to fall back on the\nevidence already set forth in Chapter XII. of my book, Modern\nMythology (1897). The Bulgarian practice I take from the Recueil de\nFolk-lore, de Litte'rature et de Science, edited by the Bulgarian Minister\nof Public Instruction, with the aid of Drs. Schischmanof (whom I\nknow personally) and Mastov. In a private letter, Dr. Schischmanof\nhints at extase religieuse, as in the self-mutilations of Dervishes and\nFakirs. Their performances are extraordinary enough, but there was\nno religious ecstacy in the little Japanese boy of six, whom Colonel\nHaggard saw pass through the fire, none in Colonel Gudgeon, none in\nthe Fijians observed by Dr. Hocken. The fire-walkers in Bulgaria\nare called Nistinares, and the faculty is regarded as hereditary. We\nfind the same opinion in Fiji, in ancient Italy, and in the Spain of the\nlast century. In Spain the fire-walkers were employed to help to put\n\f12 Andrew Lang. [part\nout fires. The story is given in the essay on the last Earl Marischal,\nin my Companions of Pickle (p. 24), and is derived from d'Alembert's\naccount of the Earl : \" There is a family or caste in Spain, who, from\nfather to son, have the power of going into the flames without being\nburned, and who, by dint of charms permitted by the Inquisition, can\nextinguish fires.\" The Duchess of Medina Sidonia thought this a\nproof of the verity of the Catholic faith, and, wishing to convert the\nEarl, asked him to view the performance. But he insisted on lighting\nthe fire himself, and to that the Spaniards would not consent, the Earl\nbeing a heretic.\nTo return to the Bulgarian Nistinares, they dance in the fire on\nMay 21st, the feast of Ss. Helena and Constantine. Great fires of\nscores of cart-loads of dry wood are made. On the embers of these\nthe Nistinares (who turn blue in the face) dance and utter prophecies,\nafterwards placing their feet in the muddy ground where libations of\nwater have been poured forth. The report says nothing as to the\nstate of their feet. The Nistinare begins to feel the effect of the fire\nafter his face has resumed its wonted colour and expression.\nAs for India, I may cite Mr. Stokes, in The Indian Antiquary,\n(II., 190), Dr. Oppert, in his Original Inhabitants of India, (p. 480),\nand Mr. Crookes, in Introduction to Popular Religion and Folk-lore in\nNorthern India, (p. 10). Mr. Stokes uses evidence from an inquest on\na boy that fell into the fire and died of his injuries, at Periyangridi.\nThe fire-pit was 27 ft. long by 7i ft. broad, and a span in depth.\nThirteen persons walked through. Mr. Stokes did not witness the\nperformance (which is forbidden by our law), but explains that the\nfire \" would hardly injure the tough skin of the sole of a labourer's\nfeet.\" Yet it killed a boy !\nThe incredulous say that the fire-walkers smear their feet with oil\nfrom the fat of the green frog. Dr. Oppert admitting that \" the heat\nis unbearable in the neighbourhood of the ditch,\" says that the\nwalkers \"as a rule do not do themselves much harm.\" This is vague.\nEqually vague is the reference to rumours about \"a certain preservative\nointment.\"\nIn Trinidad, British West Indies, Mr. Henry R. St. Clair, writing to\nme, describes (September 14th, 1896) the feat as performed by Indian\ncoolie immigrants. He personally witnessed the rite, which was like\nthat described to me by Mr. Stephen Ponder. In both cases, the per\nformers were Klings. The case witnessed by Mr. Ponder took place in\nthe Straits Settlements, Province Wellesley. The trench was about\n20 yards long by 6 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep. A pyre of wood, 4 or 5 ft.\nhigh, was lighted at noon ; by 4 p.m. it was a bed of red-hot embers.\nThe men, who with long rakes smoothed the ashes, could not stand the\nheat \" for more than a minute at a time.\" A little way from the end\n\fxxxvi.] The Fire Walk. 13\nof the trench was a hole full of water. Six coolies walked the whole\nlength, and thence into the water. \" Not one of them showed the\nleast sign of injury.\" They had been prepared by a \"devil-doctor,\"\nnot a Brahmin. On a later occasion Mr. Ponder heard that one of\nthem fell \"and was terribly burnt.\"\nIn these cases, Trinidad (and Mauritius) and the Straits Settle\nments, the performers are South Indian coolies. In all cases there\nwere multitudes of European spectators, except in Mauritius, where,\nI learn, Europeans usually take no interest in the doings of the\nheathen.\nTurning to Tonga, we have the account of Miss Teuira Henry\n(Polynesian Journal, Vol. II., No. 2, pp. 105-108). The sister and\nsister's child of Miss Henry have walked over the red-hot stones,\nas in the Rarotonga and Fijian cases. The ovens are 30 ft. in\ndiameter. The performance was photographed by Lieutenant Morn\u00a3,\nof the French Navy, and the original photograph was sent to the\nEditor of the Polynesian Journal, with a copy from it by Mr.\nBarnfield, of Honolulu. The ceremony, preparatory to cooking the\nti plant, is religious, and the archaic hymn sung is full of obsolete\nwords. Mr. Hastwell, of San Francisco, published a tract, which I\nhave not seen, on the Raiatean rite, witnessed by himself. The stones\nwere \" heated to a red and white heat.\" The natives \" walked\nleisurely across \" five times ; \" there was not even the smell of fire on\ntheir garments \" (cited in the Polynesian Journal, Vol. II., No. 3).\nThere is corroborative evidence from Mr. N. J. Tone, from Province\nWellesley, Straits Settlements, in the Polynesian Journal, II., 3, 193.\nHe did not see the rite, arriving too late, but he saw the fire-pit, and\nexamined the naked feet of the walkers. They were uninjured. Mr.\nTone's evidence is an extract from his diary.\nAs to Fiji there are various accounts. The best is that of Mr.\nBasil Thomson, son of the late Archbishop of York. Mr. Thomson\nwas an official in Fiji, and is a well-known anthropologist. HIs\nsketch, in his South Sea Yarns (p. 195, et seq.), is too long for\nquotation. The rite is done yearly, before cooking the masdwe (a\ndraccena) in the oven through which the clan Na Ivilankata walk.\n\" The pit was filled with a white-hot mass, shooting out little tongues\nof white flame.\" \" The bottom of the pit was covered with an even\nlayer of hot stones . . . the tongues of flame played continually\namong them.\" The walkers planted \"their feet squarely and firmly on\neach stone.\" Mr. Thomson closely examined the feet of four or five\nof the natives when they emerged. \" They were cool and showed no\ntrace of scorching, nor were their anklets of dried tree-fern burnt,\"\nthough \"dried tree-fern is as combustible as tinder.\" \"The instep is\ncovered with skin no thicker than our own, and we saw the men plant\n\f14 Andrew Lang. [part\ntheir insteps fairly on the stone.\" A large stone was hooked out of\nthe pit before the men entered, and one of the party dropped a pocket-\nhandkerchief upon the stone \" when the first man leapt into the oven\nand snatched what remained of it up as the last left the stones.\"\nEvery fold that touched the stone was charred. Mr. Thomson kindly\nshowed me the handkerchief. He also showed me a rather blurred\nphotograph of the strange scene. It has been rudely reproduced in\nthe Folk Lore Journal, September, 1895.\nSuch is part of the modern evidence ; for the ancient, see jEneid,\nXL, 784, et seq. ; Servius on the passage ; Pliny, Hist. Nat., VII., 2 ;\nSilius Italicus, V., 175. This evidence refers to the Hirpi, of Mount\nSoracte, a class exempted from military service by the Roman\nGovernment, because, as Virgil makes Aruns say, \" strong in faith we\nwalk through the midst of the fire, and press our footsteps in the\nglowing mass.\" The Hirpi, or Wolves, were probably a Totem group,\nlike the Wolf Totem of Tonkaway Red Indians ; they had, like the\nTonkaway, a rite in which they were told to \" behave like wolves.\"\n(Serv., ^Eneid, VII., 800). The goddess propitiated in their fire-walk\nwas Feronia, a fire-goddess (Max Miiller), or a lightning goddess\n(Kuhn), or a corn goddess (Mannhardt). Each of these scholars bases\nhis opinion on etymology. You see that scholars differ !\nI have merely given evidence for the antiquity, wide diffusion,\nand actual practice of this extraordinary rite. Neither physical\nnor anthropological science has even glanced at it (except in Dr.\nHocken's case), perhaps because the facts are obviously impossible.\nI ought to make an exception for Sir William Crookes, but he,\ndoubtless, was hallucinated, or gulled by the use of asbestos, or both.\nPerhaps Mr. Podmore can apply these explanations to the spectators\nwhom I have cited. For my part, I remain without a theory, like all\nthe European observers whom I have quoted. But, in my humble\nopinion, all the usual theories, whether of collective hallucination\n(photographic cameras being hallucinated), of psychical causes, of\nchemical application, of leathery skin on the soles of the feet, and so\non, are inadequate. There remains \" suggestion.\" Any hypnotist,\nwith his patient's permission (in writing and witnessed^ may try the\nexperiment.\nSince this paper was written I have seen an article, \"Les Dompteurs\ndu Feu,\" on the same topic, by Dr. Th. Pascal (Armales des Sciences\nPsychiques, July \u2014August, 1899). The first part of the essay is an\nextract from the Revue The'osophiqiw Frangaise. No date is given,\nbut the rite described was viewed at Benares, on October 26th, 1898.\nI am unable to understand whether Dr. Pascal is himself the spectator,\n\fxxxvi.] The Fire Walk. 15\nand narrator, of the Revue The'osophique, or whether he quotes (he\nuses marks of quotation) some other writer. The phenomena were\nof the usual kind, and the writer, examining the feet of two of the\nperformers, found the skin of the soles fine and intact. In four cases,\nin which the performers had entered the fire after the procession\u2014with\nthe Master of the Ceremonies and two excited persons, who split cocoa-\nnuts with swords\u2014had gone, there were slight cauterisations, healed\ntwo days later. The author of this passage speaks of a Brahmin\n(apparently \" The Master of the Ceremonies \") who observed to Mr.\nGovinda Das, \" that the control of the fire was not so complete as\nusual, because the images of the sanctuary had been touched by\nMahomedans and others in the crowd.\"\nThe second case, not given with marks of quotation, occurred in the\npark of Maharajah Tagore, on December 7th, 1898. \"A Frenchman,\nthe son of Dr. Javal of Paris, was present.\" The narrator, \"nous,\" was\nalso present and went up, after the rite, to venture his hand in the\nfurnace. He was warned that the Brahmin had left, ten minutes\nbefore, and that \"the fire had recovered its activity.\" The Maharajah,\nhowever, caused the ceremony to be repeated, and some minutes after,\nall was ready. The narrator then traversed the fire, barefoot, at un\npetit trot, \"a little less than two paces a second.\" As 100 yards can\nbe run in ten seconds, this trot was remarkably slow. He felt in paces\none and two a sensation of burning, in the five following paces a sensa\ntion of intense heat. There were three small brown marks on his feet,\nwhich formed blisters, but did not interfere with walking, and healed\n\"in some days.\" He now learned that the Brahmin's premier aide did\nthe ceremony not quite successfully. He is convinced that, but for\nthe ceremony, he would have been seriously injured.\nThe third case was at Benares, in February, 1899. Three Hindoos\ncollided and fell in : neither they nor their clothes were burned.\nThe author clearly regards the performers of the ceremony as\nable \" to tame considerably the destructive energy of the fire.\"\nThis, of course, is the theory of the savage devotees. The ceremony\nwas only a procession of sacred images carried in a glazed sanctuary,\nand words, not known to the spectator, were uttered by the Brahmin.\nHoly water was sprinkled, and a cocoa-nut was thrown into the oven.\nAs has been said, incantations are pronounced in Fiji and elsewhere.\nTo the anthropologist the close resemblance of the rites in Polynesia\nand India is an interesting circumstance.1\nThe subject seems to me to deserve further examination by medical\nexperts.\n1 In the World Wide Magazine (December, 1899), a Japanese lady describes the\nperformance witnessed by Colonel Haggard, already cited.\n\f16 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nII.\nDISCUSSION OF THE TRANCE PHENOMENA OF\nMRS. PIPER.\nII.\u2014Bv Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nIt is scarcely necessary to remind readers of the Proceedings of\nwhat the evidence concerning Mrs. Piper's supernormal powers con\nsists ; but as in this paper I propose to add to the discussion of it\nwithout adding to the evidence itself, it may be as well briefly to\ndescribe what my data are. The first paper about Mrs. Piper appeared\nin 1890, in Proceedings, Vol. VI. It is entitled, \"A Record of Certain\nPhenomena of Trance \" and consists of an introduction by Mr. Myers,\nan account of sittings with Mrs. Piper in England by Professor Oliver\nLodge, an account of other sittings with her in England by Dr. Walter\nLeaf and a brief account of his own experiences with Mrs. Piper by\nProfessor William James ; the whole extending to 223 pages. The\nnext contribution to the subject was \"A Record of Certain Phenomena\nof Trance,\" by Dr. Richard Hodgson, which appeared in Proceedings,\nVol. VIII., in 1892, and which is a paper of 168 pages, describing\nand discussing sittings with Mrs. Piper in America. This was followed\nin 1898 (Proceedings, Vol. XIII.), by \"A Further Record of Certain\nPhenomena of Trance,\" by Dr. Hodgson, extending to 298 pages, and\nthis again by a paper by Professor W. Romaine Newbold, entitled, \"A\nFurther Record of Certain Phenomena of Trance, Part II.,\" occupy\ning 44 pages of Proceedings, Vol. XIV. To these may be added a\n\" Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper,\" by Mr. F.\nPodmore, in the same volume, which,\u2014though, like the present paper,\nit does not add to the evidence,\u2014throws interesting light on it.\nBesides the above published papers, I have through the kindness of\nDr. Hodgson had access to certain unpublished notes of sittings held\nprevious to 1898, of which I have made some use in what follows.\nFurther evidence has been accumulating since the publication of\nProfessor Newbold's paper, and both Dr. Hodgson and Professor\nHyslop have, I understand, important further light to throw on the\nsubject ; but of this I know nothing at present in detail.\nSo much for the data ; I must add a few words as to the assump\ntions I shall make regarding the origin of the information given by\nMrs. Piper. In the first place, I accept the conclusion arrived at, as\nProfessor Newbold says, (Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 7), by \"every\none so far as I know, who has studied the case at any length, that it\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 17\nwas not consciously got by Mrs. Piper during waking life and then\nfraudulently palmed off on the sitter as supernormal \" ; or, as Dr. Leaf\nputs it: (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 559) \"as to the first and most\nobvious question, whether she consciously acquires knowledge with\nregard to her sitters, with the intention of deceiving, I may say most\npositively that I regard such a supposition as entirely untenable.\"\nFurther, I do not believe that the information as a whole is drawn by\nnormal means from the mind of the sitter ; I agree with Dr. Leaf that\n\" the more I consider the whole of the evidence, the more I remain\nconvinced that it gives proof of a real supernormal power, subject,\nhowever, under conditions at which we can hardly even guess, to\nperiods of temporary eclipse,\" (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 561) ; or, as\nProfessor Lodge says, (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 443), \"concerning the\nparticular means by which she acquires the different kinds of informa\ntion, ... I can only say with certainty that it is by none of the\nordinary methods known to Physical Science.\"\nWhat explanation then can we propose for the phenomena 1 In\ndiscussing this question, I shall assume that telepathy\u2014 in the sense of\nthe impression of one living mind by another otherwise than through\nthe recognised channels of sense\u2014may be taken as provisionally\nestablished by the evidence collected by our Society and other\ninvestigators. This being granted, I agree with Professor Lodge (op.\ncit., p. 451) \"that thought-transference is the most common-place\nexplanation to which it is possible to appeal \" in the case of Mrs.\nPiper. But in Dr. Hodgson's last paper he endeavoured to carry us a\nmomentous step further. He concluded that the hypothesis that we\nare\u2014in some instances, at least\u2014in communication with the spirits of\nthe dead through the entranced Mrs. Piper is now practically proved.\nThis seems to me to be too tremendous a conclusion to base on\nobservation of a single medium ; even such prolonged observation as\nMrs. Piper has submitted to. I fully admit, however, that there is\nvery considerable evidence for it, and I propose to adopt it as a\nworking hypothesis for the purposes of the present paper.\nAccordingly, the question I wish to argue is a subsidiary one, which\narises when this hypothesis is accepted. Granting communication from\nthe dead, I wish to argue for Telepathy versus Possession as the mode\nof communication,\u2014in an extended sense of the word Telepathy,\nwhich I must begin by explaining.\nSo far, though a good deal of evidence has been collected for the\noccurrence of telepathy between living minds both spontaneously and\nexperimentally, it has not been of much use to formulate hypotheses\nas to what telepathic communication consists in and how it occurs,\nbecause we have not been able to get the phenomenon sufficiently\nunder control to give us a chance of verifying hypotheses about it.\no\n\f18 Mrs. Henry Sidywick. [part\nBut it may safely, I think, be assumed that, granting the existence of\ntelepathy, the explanation of it must lie in one of two lines. It may be\na physical process\u2014a communication between brain and brain analogous\nto light or electrical induction or gravitation. In this case it would\nreveal to us a hitherto unknown sense, an unknown power of the\nhuman body. Or it may be a spiritual process,\u2014a communication\nbetween mind and mind in which the physical world is not concerned ;\nany cerebral change in the percipient being a consequence of it and\nnot a part of its cause. In this case it would tend to establish\nscientifically the existence of mind apart from body, with the further\nchain of probabilities that the mind continues to exist when the body\nis dead, that it continues able to carry on telepathic communication\nwith minds in the body, and, indeed, that telepathy is of the nature\nof the communication of disembodied spirits with each other. Con\nversely, if we could prove the existence of the dead and their power\nof communicating with the living, we should make it probable that\ntelepathy between the living was a non-physical process.\nThis intimate connection between the possibility of communication\nwith the dead and a theory of telepathy makes it, I think, convenient,\nwhen we are discussing the evidence for the former, to use the word\nTelepathy in a sense wide enough to include any communication\nbetween mind and mind otherwise than through the recognised\nchannels of sense, whether the minds communicating be in the body or\nnot, and it is in this sense that I here use it.\nThe thesis then that I wish to maintain is this : Granting, for the\nsake of argument, that the evidence concerning Mrs. Piper proves,\nnot only that there is telepathic communication between her trance\npersonality and living persons,1 but that knowledge is in some way\nderived from those who are dead, we have still no sufficient reason to\nthink that the intelligence actually communicating by voice or writing\nwith the sitter is any other than Mrs. Piper herself. Call it Mrs.\nPiper's trance personality, dream personality, secondary self, subliminal\nself, or what you will, but it is still Mrs. Piper ;\u2014Mrs. Piper in\ncommunication of a supernormal but partial and uncertain kind with\nother minds\u2014minds of the living and of the dead\u2014and conveying to\nthe sitter by voice and writing the information thus obtained, mixed\nup with much that has been acquired or imagined in a normal way.\nI am, of course, aware that, compared with the great question\nwhether communication with the dead takes place at all, the question\nwhether it reaches the sitter's waking consciousness through Mrs.\nPiper's intelligence or directly is comparatively a small one. Never\ntheless, for those who answer the first question in the affirmative, it is\n1See Proceeding! S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 373, for Dr. Hodgson's view as to this.\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 19\nimportant to know as far as possible how the communication occurs,\nand for those to whom the first question is still an open one, the second\nmay have an important bearing on its solution ; for the facility with\nwhich we accept new facts necessarily depends much on the coherence\nor incoherence of the theory into which they have to fit. At any rate,\nthe two questions are distinct, and in considering the bewildering\nmass of Piper evidence it cannot but be advantageous to look at it\nfrom different points of view and to examine each question in detail,\nand as far as may be by itself ; and I think that Dr. Hodgson, in his\nable analysis of the Piper evidence, has hardly done justice to or\ndiscussed sufficiently the hypothesis that in all cases, and however true\nit may be that there is really communication between the living and\nthe dead, the intelligence communicating directly with the sitter,\nthrough Mrs. Piper's organism, is Mrs. Piper.\nThe alternative hypothesis to which Dr. Hodgson inclines, and\nwhich, even when not explicitly stated, seems constantly to be assumed\nin his summary of the evidence for communication from the dead, is\nthat spirits other than Mrs. Piper's use her organism when she is\nentranced, and that in particular the spirits of certain dead persons\nknown to certain sitters speak to them directly with her voice or write\nfor them directly with her hand. This is the hypothesis I wish to\noppose. It is the obvious alternative to the hypothesis which I am\nabout to advocate, again saying emphatically that I only hold it\nprovisionally and not as a final conclusion. To pass a final judgment\non the whole complicated subject of Mrs. Piper's trance utterances, to\ndecide what we can regard as proved by them, would, I think, be\npremature ; and to pass judgment on parts of it without regard to the\nwhole, and without further experiment with other persons more or less\nsimilarly endowed, would be rash.\nThe fact with which we have to start,\u2014and which, prima facie,\ngives plausibility to the supposition that when Mrs. Piper is in trance\nthe intelligence communicating through her is not her own,\u2014is that it\ninvariably says it is some one else, and frequently acts a part unlike\nMrs. Piper's ordinary personality with very considerable consistency.\nMy own experience has been solely with the Phinuit control, and\nthose sittings in which I have taken part as sitter (as distinguished\nfrom reporter) have been bad\u2014that is, have afforded no indication\nwhatever of supernormal knowledge. Nevertheless I felt as others do,\nnot only that the Phinuit personality did not confuse itself with Mrs.\nPiper's normal self, but that the sitter was under no temptation so to\nconfuse it. Conversation with it differed from conversation with Mrs.\nPiper in her normal state as naturally as conversation with one\nacquaintance differs from conversation with another. I have no\ndoubt that the case for regarding the communicating intelligence as an\nc 2\n\f20 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nindependent individuality seems yet stronger when it represents itself\nas being an intimate deceased friend of the sitter's, sustains the part\nwith vigour, and, besides showing knowledge which it is difficult to\nsuppose to be derived from any one but the deceased, exhibits traits\ncharacteristic of him and recognises appropriately his friends and\nacquaintances. And the illusion is strengthened by the fact that two\nseeming individualities are capable of communicating simultaneously,\none by the voice speaking and one by the hand writing.\nIt is, however, well known through experience that neither the\nassertions nor the beliefs of secondary personalities are in themselves\nworthy of credence, any more than one's dream impressions are ; and,\nmoreover, that\u2014as may be seen in the case of some hypnotised\npersons \u2014they can often by suggestion be made to act, and apparently\nbelieve themselves to be, any given character. The mere assumption\nand successful personation by the trance personality of a character\ndifferent from Mrs. Piper's affords, therefore, no sufficient ground for\nbelieving that it is not herself. Nor does the possession by the trance\npersonality and the normal Mrs. Piper of two more or less independent\nchains of memory prove anything, for a similar distinctness in chains\nof memory may easily be observed between the hypnotic trance\npersonality and the waking personality of the same individual, and\neven between different stages of hypnotisation of the same individual.\n(See Mr. Gurney's papers on \"The Stages of Hypnotism,\" Proceedings,\nVol. II., \"Stages of Hypnotic Memory,\" Vol. IV.; also L' Automatism*\nPsychologique, by Professor Pierre Janet.)\nNor again does the simultaneous existence of two apparently\nindependent intelligences, one speaking and the other writing, prove\nanything, for this phenomenon too may be observed in good hypnotic\nsubjects when the supposition that either intelligence was any other\nthan the subject's own would be obviously absurd. (See Mr. Gurney's\npaper on \"Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States,\" Proceedings,\nVol. IV., and also Professor Janet's book.)\nThe only thing that would prove the communicating intelligence\nnot to be Mrs. Piper would be the possession of a stream of con\nsciousness provably continuous with that of some other person and\ndiscontinuous with that of Mrs. Piper. Proof of this would be\nexceedingly hard to obtain, because if telepathy between the dead\nand the living be possible, we may suppose either active prompting\nof Mrs. Piper's trance personality by another spirit, or passive com\nmunity of ideas between the trance personality, the sitter and the\nspirit of the deceased. Either might enable the trance personality to\nproduce a semblance of possessing the stream of consciousness of the\ndeceased within the limits of the communications that occur. The\ntrance personality actually claims sometimes that it is prompted, as\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 21\nabove suggested, by another spirit. For instance, in a sitting of\nDr. Thaw's {Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 567), when his friend Dr. H.\nwas supposed to be communicating, not directly, but through Phinuit,\na long speech was made so characteristic of Dr. H. that Dr. Thaw,\nwishing to know whether he or Phinuit was speaking, said, \" Can you\ntell me anything about Dr. Phinuit ? \" The answer was, \" I'm talking\nto you myself, you rascal ; I'm talking for him.\" \" Well,\" said\nDr. Thaw, \"you're trying to make us think he's talking,\" to which\nPhinuit replied, \" I'm simply telling you what he says. I'm trying to\nimitate him.\"\nIt will be replied that though it may be almost impossible to\nproduce clear proof for the world that the communicator is what he\nprofesses to be, yet in spite of this difficulty, practically adequate proof\nhas been obtained in such a case as George Pelham's. For in this case\nthere is so much that is characteristic in small ways, in manner,\nexpressions used, etc., and in particular so unfailing a recognition of\nfriends, and recognition of them in a manner appropriate to each, that\nfor those who knew G. P. the conclusion is inevitable that no mere\nprompting by G. P., no combination of reading of G. P.'s and the sitter's\nminds by the trance personality could enable it to give so exact a\nrepresentation of him. The communicator must be G. P. himself.\nIt is, no doubt, impossible for one who has not had the special\nexperience on which subjective estimates of this kind are based to\njudge fully of their value ; many small points involved can hardly\nbe conveyed in words, and others are of too intimate a nature for the\nsitter to be willing to publish them. I think, however, that the\nimportance of the evidence for direct communication afforded by such\nexperiences may easily be over-estimated. I would point out, in the\nfirst place, that the representation given of the deceased person must\nfrom the nature of the case be of a very limited kind. For instance,\nwhen the soi-disant G. P. communicates, he usually does so in writing,\nthe whole of Mrs. Piper's body except the hand being in an inert\ncondition. At the best, therefore, he is limited to the words he\nwrites and to the possibilities of dramatic representation of a person's\nwhole maniere d'etre through the movements of the hand alone. The\nhandwriting, it will be remembered, is not like that of the living G. P.\nThe case is not materially improved when the communication is by\nspoken words, for gesture and expression and voice are still excluded\nfrom the likeness, \" and the language shows a tendency to depart more\nor less from the language that would have been used by the com\nmunicator when living\" {Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 332). A likeness\nunder these circumstances must bear to a full dramatic representation\nof a person somewhat the relation that a clever pen and ink sketch\ndone in a few strokes bears to a finished portrait in oils. The likeness\n\f22 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nmay be unmistakable in both ; but that in the sketch, being limited to\na few salient points, requires much less minute knowledge of the\nsubject to produce.\nIn the second place, the likeness of the trance personality to the\nperson it purports to be does not strike every one equally. Thus Miss\nW. writes (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 29): \"The clearly marked\npersonality of that friend, whom I will call T., is to me the most\nconvincing proof of Mrs. P[iper]'s supernatural power, but it is a proof\nimpossible to present to any one else.\" Yet her mother felt, after a\nsitting, that \"it did not really seem likeT.\" (Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\np. 33.) And Mr. Marte, a friend of G. P.'s, formed, we are told, an\nopinion entirely unfavourable to Mrs. Piper, from which I infer that\nhe did not think the personation of G. P. successful. (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 429).\nThe personation, again, is sometimes very imperfect, even within the\nnarrow limits possible. Thus, in Miss A. M. R.'s experience, the\ncommunicator purporting to be her friend seems to have presented a\nmixture of the characteristics of that friend and of Phinuit. She\nwrites (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 113) :\u2014\nWhen my friend H. takes control of the medium, it seems to be quite a\ndifferent personality [from Phinuit], although there is something in the voice\nor manner of speaking that is like Dr. P[hinuit]. The voice, however, is\nnot nearly so loud. When I asked him once why this was, he told me\nthat Dr. P[hinuit] was right by him, and that he could not stay a moment\nwithout his help. In a great many little ways he is quite like what my\nfriend used to be when living, so much so that I am afraid it would take a\ngreat deal of explanation to make me believe that his identical self had not\nsomething to do with it, wholly apart from the medium's powers, or from\nanything that may be in my own mind concerning him.\nOne more thing about these personations of known individuals I\nmay notice. They seldom, if ever, I think, profess to present them\nselves in proprid persond at once. At their first appearance their\ncommunications purport to come through some one else ; or, as Dr.\nHodgson expresses it, they \" require some practice in handling the\nwriting mechanism, and at first the assistance of G. P. or some other\nexperienced amanuensis has usually been required.\" (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 376.) Thus at first Phinuit speaks for G. P., G. P.\nwrites for John Hart when he first communicates, and so forth. This\nis what we should expect to happen if Mrs. Piper's trance personality,\nwith the aid of the sitters, and by means of knowledge accumulated\nnormally and supernormally, gradually acquires a more or less coherent\nconception of the individual it ultimately takes itself to be. So, too,\non this hypothesis, should we expect the gradual improvement in the\npersonation which seems\u2014in some cases, at least\u2014to occur.\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 23\nSo far I have tried to show that the grounds on which the belief is\nbased that the direct communicator is the person it alleges itself to be\nmay easily be less cogent than at first sight appears, even when that\nperson is known to the sitters, and is more or less successfully repre\nsented. I now go on to show that the communications afford in ,\ncertain cases positive grounds for believing that the direct communicator\nis not the person it professes to be and probably believes itself to be,\nand, further, that it is Mrs. Piper's trance personality.\nInconsistencies, incoherences and contradictions in a communi\ncator's account of himself, oblivion and error about things which it\nseems inconceivable that the real person should have forgotten or be\nmistaken about, and an intellectual standpoint inferior to his in life\nare, it will be admitted, good reasons for doubting the communicator's\nclaim to identity. Suggestibility, a tendency to false excuses and\nprevarication, to claim powers which it does not possess, a tendency\nalso to recur foolishly to things that have turned up at previous\nsittings but have lost their interest, are characteristics of an automatic\npersonality. And that the automatic personality is here Mrs. Piper's\nis confirmed by certain intellectual limitations, an interest in certain\nkinds of trifles, and certain impressions as to what has occurred, which\nthe communicator exhibits, and of which the origin is most easily\nfound in Mrs. Piper's training and habits. I shall try to illustrate\nthese points by examples.\nPhinuit is, of course, a glaring instance of a communicator whose\naccount of himself is inconsistent, incoherent and altogether impossible.\nMr. Leaf puts the case briefly, as follows (Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\np. 560) :\u2014\nThat Dr. Phinuit is what he gives himself out, the spirit of a departed\nMarseillais physician, I may say at once that I do not see the least ground\nfor believing. His own word does not, in view of his moral standard, apart\nfrom other considerations, carry even a presumption of veracity ; nor has a\nsingle one of the numerous statements he had made as to his life on earth\nproved capable of verification. On the other side, his complete ignorance of\nFrench is a positive ground for disbelieving him, and one which he has never\nbeen able to explain.\nThe case against him is shown to be even stronger in the report\nmade by Dr. Hodgson in 1892. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 50-54.)\nDr. Hodgson was not at that time inclined to believe Phinuit to be a\n\" spirit,\" and if he is more inclined to think so now, it is because the\nG. P. control vouches for him in some sort.\nThe group of communicators whom Dr. Hodgson refers to in the\nlast section of his last paper on Mrs. Piper (Proceedings,Vo\\. XIII., pp.\n407-412)\u2014the so-called \"spirit guides\" of Mr. Stainton Moses\u2014again\nare apparently so hopelessly at sea about their alleged earth life, and so\n\f24 , Mrs. Henry Sidgwich [part\n..\nignorant about Mr. Moses himself and what they were supposed to\nhave taught him, that I cannot see how it is possible to believe them\nto be what they represent themselves as being. Mr. Moses' \"spirit\nguides,\" whether phases of Mr. Moses or not, wrote through his hand\nthat they were the spirits of certain definite persons known to history.\nThe names they gave have not, I believe, been published, and are\nknown to very few persons. In Mr. Moses' writings they appear under\nthe pseudonyms, Imperator, Mentor, Rector, Doctor. If, therefore,\nthey could, through Mrs. Piper, give the unpublished names which Mr.\nMoses has left on record, it would be a very interesting piece of\nevidence. But though Mrs. Piper's hand has written various different\nnames as being theirs, none are right ; and not only are wrong names\ngiven, but they are supported for a time with insistence and detail,\nonly to be rejected afterwards in favour of others equally wrong. The\nsoi-disant Doctor, for instance,\u2014in Dr. Hodgson's MS. records of\nsittings\u2014claims to be Homer, who sang of Troy, and is indignant when\nit is doubted. Mentor, again, maintains, during more than one sitting,\nthat he is Ulysses, says (Dec. 7th, 1896) that he \"often, often\" sees\nTelemachus, and that Penelope\u2014though he does not apparently\nremember her name till Dr. Hodgson suggests it\u2014 is with him always.\nI do not see how elaborate false statements of this kind, inconsistent\nwith the claims of the communicators to be Mr. Stainton Moses'\n\" guides,\" are to be accounted for by any amount of difficulty experi\nenced by them in using Mrs. Piper's organism as a writing machine.\nThe soi-disant guides of Mr. Moses are guaranteed by G. P. just as\nPhinuit is, and this Dr. Hodgson seems to regard as a reason for\nbelieving in their independent existence. But surely it may be equally\nwell regarded as a reason for believing the G. P. control to be itself a\nphase of Mrs. Piper's trance personality. Moreover, believing in G. P.'s\nguarantee involves us in difficulties, for he is capable of corroborating\nfalse statements; e.g., Doctor's statement that he was Homer. And\nfurther (on April 23rd, 1897), Rector warns Dr. Hodgson \"not to rely\ntoo much upon the statements made as tests, so-called, by your friend\nGeorge. He is too far away from your earth now to be clear in regard\nto tests, test-conditions, etc.\" If the guaranteed spirits throw doubt\non the trustworthiness of the guarantors, where are we ?\nAs an instance of ignorance and mistake about its own name in a\npersonality professing to have been known to the sitter, I may quote a\nremark of \"Mrs. M.\" in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 348. She says:\u2014\nThe aunt of my husband's who died in June, 1894, has often sent me,\nthrough Phinuit or my husband, some appropriate sounding message, and\ntwice purported to write herself, but never seemed able to give her own\nname correctly ; it is an unusual name, probably unique in this country, and\nI tried to get it written a number of times, but with no success.\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 25\nIf the writing intelligence was really the aunt, this forgetfulness\nof her name is odd, but it is still more odd that she should make\nincorrect guesses.\nA curious instance, not yet published, I think, of false statement\nby the communicating intelligence occurred on one occasion (March\n7th, 1894) when Dr. Hodgson had given the entranced Mrs. Piper\na MS. of Dr. Wiltse to hold. Later in the sitting Dr. Wiltse himself\nwas personated, the communicator stating in a confused way that he\nwas dead and his body in the water. Dr. Wiltse is well known to\nreaders of the Proceedings as having communicated several interesting\nexperiences to the Society, which have been published. In reply to\nDr. Hodgson's questions, one of these was described by the soi-disant\nDr. Wiltse sufficiently for identification, leaving no doubt as to the\nperson intended by the communicator. But all the time Dr. Wiltse\nwas alive and well and going through no abnormal experience of any\nkind ; nor was any knowledge shown by the communicating intelligence\nof his actual doings or surroundings. We may surely more easily\nattribute this personation to a freak of Mrs. Piper's trance personality\nthan account for it in any other way.\nAgain, is it possible to suppose that Mr. Moses, who never was in\nProfessor Sidgwick's house, should, writing with Mrs. Piper's hand,\nsend a message, \" when you see my friend Sidgwick, kindly ask him if\nhe remembers the evening we spent together at his own home \" 1\nBesides specific concrete statements, inconceivable as coming from\nthe person the communicator professes to be, we find evidence in\ncertain cases of a much lower intellectual standpoint than was his\non earth. Take, for instance, Professor James' account of the \" E.\nControl \" (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 656) :\u2014\nThe first messages came through Phiuuit about a year ago, when, after\ntwo years of non-intercourse with Mrs. Piper, she lunched one day at our\nhouse and gave my wife and myself a sitting afterwards. It was bad\nenough ; and I confess that the human being in mo was so much stronger\nthan the man of science that I was too much disgusted with Phinuit's\ntiresome twaddle even to note it down. When later the phenomenon\ndeveloped into pretended direct speech from E. himself, I regretted this,\nfor a complete record would have been useful. I can now merely say that\nneither then, nor at any other time, was there, to my mind, the slightest\ninner verisimilitude in the personation. But the failure to produce a\nmore plausible E. speaks directly in favour of the non-participation of the\nmedium's conscious mind in the performance. She could so easily have\ncoached herself to be more effective.1\nOr, again, G. P., when he ventures on philosophical subjects, is apt\nto miss the point in a way which I understand the real G. P. would\n1 This remark is true also of the personations of the Stainton Moses' \"guides.\"\n\f26 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nnot have done in this life. I know Dr. Hodgson does not altogether\nagree, but it seems to me impossible to .read the following more\ndetailed account of the sitting of which part is briefly described in\nProceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 428, and believe that the alleged G.

P. : \"He knows nothing, his theory is ludicrous.\"\nM. : He just said he agreed with him. That was the point I was asking\nabout, the permanency of law.\nOther instances of communication below the education and intelli\ngence of the supposed communicator will be found in a subsequent\npart of the argument.\nI proceed now to the manifestation of characteristics which belong\nto automatism, beginning with suggestibility. The following is an\ninstance from Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 346. Mrs. M. writes :\u2014\nOn February loth and March 7th, 1895, Miss Edmunds had two sittings\nfor me ... I asked Miss Edmunds to ask my husband to write his full\nname, which was not on my visiting card, and which she could not possibly be\naware of. The name was at once correctly written, but for some reason Miss\nEdmunds did not think it was right, and asked if the writer was quite sure\nof it. The name was then differently written, though commencing with\nthe same letter R (which was on my visiting card).\nHaving once been assumed, it becomes established, and at a sitting\nwhich Miss Edmunds had for Mrs. M., on January 25th of the follow\ning year (1896), the name was written again in the same way, though\nMiss Edmunds then knew it was wrong, and knew what the real name\nwas. Now it is not likely that Mr. M., had he been in direct communi\ncation with Miss Edmunds, could have been induced by the mere\nexpression of a doubt to substitute a name that was not his for the\ntrue one. But if we conceive Mrs. Piper, dreaming as it were, and in\npartial and fragmentary communication of a telepathic nature with\nother minds, such as appears to occur between percipient and agent in\nthought-transference experiments, the whole incident falls into line\nwith previous experience.1\nIn this particular case we have the interesting phenomenon of the\ncommunicator being led by suggestion off the right track on to a\nwrong one. But any one who has had sittings with Mrs. Piper will\n1 It should be noted that Mrs. M. believes that her husband had actually com\nmunicated through Mrs. Piper. Her summing up of the impression the whole series\nof sittings made on her, given in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 348, is interesting and\ninstructive. It will be seen that the giving of a wrong name was combined with\ngood dramatic impersonation.\n\f28 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nremember how indications given by the sitter are followed by the\ncommunicating intelligence. Mr. Clarke, whose sittings are recorded\nin Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 569-581, notes an instance of such\nfollowing of an intentionally false lead. Phinuit says (p. 574) :\u2014\n\"You are the fellow that has got the hole in the ground with the black\nthings in it.\" (Sitter : \" Coals ? \") \" Of course, do you think I am a fool ?\nThere is something to come from that hole yet, because I see light beyond it.\"\n[Note by the sitter :] \"In the former sitting mention had been made of a\ntown lot and buildings as 'interest in the ground.' The vagueness of this\nreference is here developed, by a question intended to be misleading, into\ndefinite error.\"\nSuch incidents exhibit a form of the \" fishery \"\u2014to use Professor\nLodge's word\u2014so much practised by Phinuit, and which appears to\nmany simply a fraudulent attempt to get from the sitter the informa\ntion to be reproduced to him as supernormally acquired. But though\nthere is no difficulty in supposing a trance personality guilty of such\ndeliberate attempts to make its powers seem greater than they are, I\nthink it probable that much of the apparent fishery is unconscious, and\nmerely due to a dream-like readiness to take ideas indiscriminately,\nwhencesoever they come, and weave them into a whole.\nA disposition to assume powers not possessed and to resort to\nprevarication and false excuses to account for ignorance or failure are\nmoral defects which are well known to be frequently exhibited in\nautomatic writing, and which are abundantly exhibited in Mrs. Piper's\ntrance utterances, whether spoken or written. I have said moral\ndefects, but perhaps it would be more correct to say defects partly\nmoral, partly intellectual. The habit of attributing to reason actions\nand opinions really due to impulse or sentiment, and the consequent\nnecessity of finding plausible reasons afterwards in order to maintain\nself-respect as a reasonable being, is common in human nature, and the\nman who does it usually thinks he has really been influenced by the\nreasons he alleges to himself and others. The apparently lower moral\nstandpoint of the automatic personality may be at least partly due to\nabeyance of the critical faculty, which tends to render the powers\nassumed and the excuses made occasionally so absurd that it is difficult\nto believe the communicating intelligence to have taken itself in\nby them.\nThe kind of thing I refer to is well described by Dr. Leaf in the\nfollowing passage (Vol. VI., p. 560) :\u2014\nPhinuit, in fact, exhibits just the low moral tone which we so often find\nin table-talking, planchette, and other manifestations, as we now regard\nthem, of the secondary self. He swears freely, and indulges in slang of the\nvulgar New England sort, in a way quite alien from the manners of Mrs.\nPiper. This is, of course, a trifle ; but it is more serious when we find him\ncontinually making attempts to deceive. If he is not able to make a right\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 29\nstatement, he is always ready with a guess of more or less ingenuity to\nconceal his ignorance, or at least with some ambiguity or subterfuge which\nshould make a show of turning the difficulty. Hardly a sitting passed\nwithout his making at least a few statements which were altogether wrong.1\nAs a particular instance of Phinuit's prevarication I may quote a\npassage in a discussion of him by Dr. Hodgson (Vol. VIII., p. 50) :\u2014\nConcerning his inability to speak French, Phinuit's original explanation\nto me was that he had lived in Metz the latter part of his life, and there\nwere many English there, so that he was compelled to speak English, and\nhad forgotten his French. I replied that this explanation was very sur\nprising, and that a much more plausible one would be that he was obliged\nto use the brain of the medium, and would therefore manifest no more\nfamiliarity with French than she possessed. This\u2014trite enough\u2014suggestion\nappeared to Phinuit also more plausible, since a few days later he offered\nit himself to another sitter as an explanation of his inability to sustain a\nconversation in French !\nBut no one denies that, whatever Phinuit may be, he possesses many\nof the characteristics of an automatic personality, and I may be asked\nto produce instances of prevarication in other personations. Here,\nthen, is one perpetrated by a communicator professing to be Mr. Stainton\nMoses. At a sitting (recorded in MS.) on November 14th. 1896, he\nsays : \" Give my love to . . . Myers, Watts, Massey, Wedgwood,\nBennett, and any other friends who may inquire for me.\" Dr. Hodgson\nnaturally replies, \" But Wedgwood is with you now, isn't he t \" To\nwhich the communicator, with obvious insincerity, rejoins, \" I intended\nthis. He just mentioned to send his love also.\"\nG. P. is the supposed communicator in the following case. He\nhad been asked at a previous sitting for names of the members of a\ncertain association. He says : \u2014\nI answered part of that question [the part he answered was correct], but\ndid not give the names of the other two people, because it would be no test,\nbecause I told her [Mrs. Howard] the names of the other two in life, and as\nshe knows them, if I was to give the names in her presence, they would\nsay it was thought-transference. No, I shall reserve the two names to tell\nHodgson some time when he is alone with me, because he does not know\nthem. [All true.] (Proceediwjs, Vol. XIII., p. 303.)\nDr. Hodgson remarks on this, \" Many will regard this as perhaps\nan excuse for ignorance, as names subsequently given were not\ncorrect.\" I confess to being one of the many, but I think it would be\nhard on G. P. to attribute the false excuse to him.\nAn experiment frequently tried in sittings with Mrs. Piper is to\nask the \" control \" to visit distant people or places and report what is\n(i Cf. also Mr. Myers' remarks on automatic personalities, Proctcdhiqs, Vol. VI.,\np. 4-W.)\n\f30 Mrs. Henry Sidywick. [part\nseen. The communicator generally professes to be able to do this ; but\nthe profession is seldom justified by the results, though there are\napparent exceptions. Now that Mrs. Piper's trance personality should\nimagine it has this power, and should accordingly dream that it visits\nthe places\u2014that, in fact, Mrs. Piper dreaming should imagine the\nwhole thing\u2014is natural enough ; but it is, I think, going out of our\nway to complicate hypotheses by attributing the dream to G. P. or\n\"George Eliot.\" While the series of hitherto unpublished sittings to\nwhich I have more than once referred was going on, Mr. Myers was\nholding a series with another medium in England. It had been arranged\nbetween him and Dr. Hodgson that supernormal communication\nshould, if possible, be established between the two. Mrs. Piper's\n\"controls\"\u2014 \"George Eliot\" especially\u2014professed to visit Mr. Myers'\ncircle and to give and receive messages. Not once was there a\nglimmer of truth in what was said. Mr. Myers wrote : \" Yours up to\nApril 23rd inclusive received. Not a vestige of truth ; no messages\nreceived ; whole description erroneous.\" After hearing this, \" George\nEliot \" continues to assert that she gave the messages, and saw the\nsitters, and when Dr. Hodgson asks, \" How about the numerous\nmessages that you brought back from Myers 1\" replies, \"We would\nask you to ask him to consider carefully what his thoughts were, that\nis, those not put into actual speech.\" Observe that it is not merely\nthe failures that I lay stress upon, but the reiterated false statements\nthat things have been seen which have not been seen, and messages\nreceived that have not been received, or delivered that have not been\ndelivered. We find (Vol. XIII., p. 345) Mrs. M.'s husband similarly\nprofessing to repeat messages, but always giving them quite wrong,\nexcept in one case, and in that case there had been no deliberate\nexperiment. Of the same character are the incidents connected with\nMiss Hannah Wilde's letter, of which Professor James gives the\nfollowing account in 1890 (Vol. VI., p. 657) :\u2014\nMrs. Blodgett, of Holyoke, Mass., and her sister, devised, before the\nlatter died, what would have been a good test of actual spirit return. The\nsister, Miss H. W., wrote upon her death-bed a letter, sealed it, and gave it\nto Mrs. B. After her death no one living knew what words it contained.\nMrs. B., not then knowing Mrs. Piper, entrusted to me the sealed letter,\nand asked me to give Mrs. Piper some articles of the deceased sister's\npersonal apparel to help her to get at its contents. This commission I\nperformed. Mrs. P. gave correctly the full name (which even I did not\nknow) of the writer, and finally, after a delay and ceremony which occupied\nseveral weeks on Phinuit's part, dictated what purported to be a copy of the\nletter. This I compared with the original (of which Mrs. B. permitted me\nto break the seal) ; but the two letters had nothing in common, nor were\nany of the numerous domestic facts alluded to in the medium's letter\nacknowledged by Mrs. Blodgett to be correct. Mrs. Piper was equally\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 31\nunsuccessful in two later attempts which she made to reproduce the con\ntents of this document, although both times the revelation purported to\ncome direct from its deceased writer.\nThis subject of Miss Hannah Wilde's letter continues to recur at\nsittings long after the above passage was written, and always with\nequal futility. It is an instance of the foolish return to a subject\nwhich has lost its interest, which we find in cases where co-ordination\nis lacking, as in automatic writing or second childhood. Dr. Hodgson\nnotices this characteristic, and describes it as follows (Vol. X1IL,\np. 333) :\u2014\nThat the writing should frequently\u2014especially towards the end of the\nsitting, as the communicator becomes exhausted and stupefied, and loses the\npower of inhibition\u2014become extremely automatic and dreamy is to be\nexpected ; and questions put to the communicator in this state will be\nanswered by the first vague associations that rise to the surface of the failing\nconsciousness. Not only is this the case, but such irrelevant (as they may\nbe) associations occasionally tend to recur at later periods, when the com\nmunicator lapses into the same stage of dreaminess, precisely as they might\nbe expected to do in ourselves. For example, in the latter part of Professor\nNorton's sitting on May 26th, 1894, when Professor Norton put a question\nwhich G. P. living iu full consciousness would have answered by a reference to\nan essay he wrote at Harvard on Jane Austen, G. P. replied by references to\nwhat he had written about Robert Noyes (pseudonym), the life of whom he\nhad published not long before his death, and to articles in the Sim, a New York\npaper with which he was connected at the time of his death. Professor\nNorton then mentioned Jane Austen. On two or three later occasions, at the\nend of a sitting, when the writing became particularly dreamy, the name of\nProfessor Norton appeared in connection with that of Jane Austen.\nThe difference between Dr. Hodgson's interpretation of this dream\nlike futility and my own is that he is disposed to attribute it to the\ndifficulties of a spirit other than Mrs. Piper in using her organism,\nwhile to me it seems an indication that the communicators are no\nother than Mrs. Piper herself in trance.\nSo far the qualities I have wished to call attention to in the\ncommunications\u2014indications of suggestibility and so forth\u2014are such\nas might occur in any automatic writing. But it somewhat strengthens\nthe case to note that there are many things in the communications\nwhich are natural enough if we suppose them to come from Mrs.\nPiper, but decidedly less so if attributed to the supposed com\nmunicator. I think it is to Mrs. Piper's own interest in such\ntrifles that we may trace the frequent recurrence in the sittings of\ndomestic details\u2014new hate, lost pocket-handkerchiefs, etc.\u2014and to the\ncustoms of Mrs. Piper's social circle that we may trace such a false\nstatement by the supposed G. P. as the following :\u2014In answer to the\nquestion, \" Can't you tell us something . . . your mother has\n\f32 Airs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\ndone?\" he replies, \"I saw her brush my clothes and put them away.\nI was by her side when she did it.\" As a matter of fact, G. P.'s\nclothes were brushed and put away after his death, as Mrs. Pelham\nwrote, not by herself, but by \" the man who had valeted George.\"\nG. P. was not likely to suppose that his mother would personally brush\nhis clothes, or to be interested in the matter at all ; but in Mrs. Piper's\nmind the idea would easily associate itself with the ideas of his death\nand his mother.\nPhinuit's intellectual attainments were notoriously limited to Mrs.\nPiper's. We have already referred to his ignorance of French, and\nagain Dr. C. W. F. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 51) questions whether\nPhinuit's medical knowledge extends \" beyond what Mrs. Piper has\nread in ' Domestic Medicine.' He always gives the common or vulgar\nnames of the medicines he describes, and never their botanical ones.\"\nSimilar limitations are conspicuously shown in references to history,\nliterature, and science. We may take the statement by the alleged\nSir Walter Scott that there are monkeys in the sun as an instance.\nThis is mentioned by Professor W. R. Newbold (Proceedings, Vol.\nXIV., p. 48) in connection, as the reader will remember, with a very\ncurious and interesting incident indicating thought-transference from\na distance between himself and Dr. Hodgson and Mrs. Piper, which\nI need not enter into here.\nThe most glaring instances of what I mean naturally occur in the\ncourse of non-evidential parts of Mrs. Piper's trance utterances, which\nhave not generally been published. I will give some from the MS.\nrecords of unpublished sittings. Here is a biological statement\nmade on January 27th, 1897. Imperator says, the \"interior,\" the\n\" spirit,\" comes in \" in the bird and the monkey,\" not in the horse\nor the dog ; for \" the brain of each is of a lower quality, and has\npractically no mind.\" All birds and monkeys, he says, have \" in\nteriors,\" but no other animal except man. The following again are\nspecimens of chemistry and physics. Rector says, on February 1st,\n1897, that \" the spiritual ether is not composed of oxygen and\nhydrogen . . . it is composed of the finer tissues termed lumini-\nferous ether.\" And Imperator tells Dr. Hodgson on February 5th,\n1897, that \"the etherial or spiritual body is composed of air, light,\nand a large amount of hydrogen \" . . . \" heat, light, air, hydrogen.\"\nLater in the sitting he says \" it is known to us as ether,\" and further\n\" the body of the medium becomes filled with luminiferous ether\n. . . until it is so distended that it cannot contain any more.\"\nDr. Hodgson naturally expostulates about some of these statements,\nand Imperator accordingly modifies his views as the sitting proceeds,\nand finally arrives at the assertion that \" the ether body is a subtle\nand exquisite matter known to us as vacium . . . not on the\n\fxxxvi.] Discusxion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 33\nsame plane as hydrogen at all.\" And we are reduced to a still more\nhopeless state of confusion between mind and matter when we are\ntold next day that \"vacium\" is \"known as love.\" Confusion in all\nthis there undoubtedly is, but it is, I think, clearly the confusion of a\nperson talking about what he does not understand, not the confusion\nof a person who knows, but has a difficulty in expressing himself.\nAnd the same is true of the communicator's views on literary and\nhistorical matters. For instance, Mentor, on December 7th, 1896,\nwhen professing to be Ulysses, is asked by Dr. Hodgson after Achilles.\nHe says \"the murderer.\" Dr. Hodgson: \"He slew Hector.\" Mentor:\n\" Yes,\" and later he explains \" His intentions were not evil, it was\nan insane impulse.\" On another occasion (June 4th, 1897) \"George\nEliot \" describes her meeting with Bacon, who says, \" You have\nquestioned my reality. Question it no more. I am Shakespeare.\" On\nMarch 30th, 1897, again, \" George Eliot \" met \" several distinguished-\nlooking gentlemen,\u2014Shelley and Chaucer, the original and only\nwriter of ' Canterbury Tales,' then Burns\" ... \"I also saw the\noriginal Adam Bede \" . . . \" also Homer.\"\nThe same want of knowledge is shown in the statements of Mrs.\nPiper's \" Imperator \" about Melchisedek \u2014 such as that \"just before\nIsrael was sent into bondage \" Melchisedek \" departed and returned to\n(Sod\" (on February 22nd, 1897), or (at the same sitting), that \"about\nthe time of his [Melchisedek's] ascending there came the tribe known\nas the Jews.\" Again (February 23rd), an interval is assumed between\nthe days of Melchisedek and of Abraham during which \" none better,\npurer, more godlike reigned than he.\" After this Dr. Hodgson gave a\nbrief account of the blessing of Abraham by Melchisedek, and the\nnext day (February 24th), when taxed with having spoken of the days\nbetween Melchisedek and Abraham, Imperator says, \" That is wrongly\nregistered ; there was no time between.\" Again, on March 10th,\n\" Imperator \" says that Melchisedek reigned spiritually all through\nthe days of \" Abraham, Moses, Elijah and Elisha down to the days of\nKing David.\" Now Mr. Stainton Moses' \" Imperator \" said a good\ndeal about Melchisedek which has been published in Spirit Teachings,\nand which, though there is no ground for supposing it to be all true,\nis at any rate sensible and coherent, and such as we should expect\nfrom an educated man. A comparison of the account given by Mrs.\nPiper's Imperator and Mr. Moses' Imperator reveals some faint\nresemblances between the two\u2014just enough to suggest that Mrs. Piper\nhad seen the passages in Spirit Teachings, as was doubtless the case,\nsince Dr. Hodgson left a copy with her on January 27th. The\nreproduction, if reproduction it can be called, is certainly not what\none would expect from a person who had got up what had been said in\norder to reproduce it. But on the other hand, the remarks I have\nD\n\f34 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nquoted and referred to will hardly, I think, seem to any one to be\nthose of a person who understands what he is talking about and is only\nhindered from making it clear by a difficulty in manipulating the\nmachinery of communication. They are statements which can only be\nexplained by supposing absence of knowledge.\nThe illustrations I have given are, I think, sufficient, or perhaps\nmy readers may think more than sufficient. It only remains briefly to\nrecapitulate the argument. We have presented to us in Mrs. Piper's\ntrance a number of soi-disant different personalities\u2014some of them\nknown to have lived and to be now dead, some of them living, some\nprobably imaginary. The statements and the intellectual calibre of\nmany of them are utterly inconsistent with their claims, and even in\nthe best personations there are lapses which cannot easily be explained\nif we are in direct communication with the professed communicator.\nThese lapses and limitations, and other characteristics of the communi\ncations, are just such as have been frequently observed in secondary\npersonalities, and in particular correspond to what we should expect\nto find in Mrs. Piper's secondary personality under the suggestive\ninfluence of the conditions of the sittings. I am, therefore, driven\nto the conclusion that Mrs. Piper's trance-intelligence has a strong\ntendency to unconscious dramatic personation ; and is continually\ndreaming itself to be a number of different persons under the influence\nof suggestion (including self suggestion) somewhat as an ordinary\nhypnotic subject can be made by suggestion to assume different\ncharacters with startling dramatic effect. At the same time\u2014as\nwe have assumed throughout\u2014along with the limitations there are\nfragments of knowledge exhibited by the trance personality in some\nsittings, which it is very difficult to suppose to have been acquired\nby Mrs. Piper in any normal way. A large proportion of these\nfragments of knowledge are in the minds of the sitters, some are\nin the minds of distant living persons, and a few were, so far as\nwe can tell, known only to the dead. And further the selection\nand grouping of some of these fragments, even when they might\nhave been learnt from living minds, is, as Mr. Hodgson has pointed\nout, sometimes most easily explained by supposing that the dead are\npartially responsible for it. Now, if we may assume that telepathy\nis possible between living minds and between the minds of the living\nand of the dead, and that the process in the two cases is similar, we\nfind that our facts arrange themselves in a comparatively simple\nway. Mrs. Piper, we suppose, has in trance an unusually developed\ntelepathic faculty. As in telepathic experiments with hypnotised\nsubjects, ideas come to her in more or less dream-like sequence with\nout her being generally able to trace their origin, which is sometimes\ntelepathic and more often not.\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 35\nIt is introducing a complication almost gratuitously to suppose that\ncommunication with the dead is different in kind from telepathic\ncommunication with the living, and that, in order to communicate,\nthe dead must turn out Mrs. Piper's spirit and themselves take its\nplace in her organism, \u2014their want of practice in using it being\nthe cause of the confusion and imperfection of the communication.\nConfusion and imperfection we certainly find ; but we always have\nfound them in thought-transference experiments, and we do not try\nto account for this by supposing that the agent's spirit makes direct\nuse of the percipient's nervous system to express through it the num\nbers or diagrams to be transferred and, owing to want of the same\npractice in using the percipient's brain that he has in using his own,\noften gives the wrong number ! Why, if the communication occurs\nat all, it should be so fragmentary and irregular, wo cannot tell.\nWhere the failure in the transmission occurs we do not know. It may\nwell be in the organism ;\u2014it is conceivable that potentially and sub-\nliminally all minds are in telepathic communication, though the results\nemerge into consciousness obscurely and incompletely, and often not\nat all. But to suppose the organism to be the cause of the failure is a\nvery different thing from the ponderous hypothesis that another spirit\nuses that organism, and uses it imperfectly.\nIt would not, however, be fair to call the hypothesis of spirit\npossession quite gratuitous, for there is a difficulty in the telepathic\nhypothesis to which I have not yet referred. It is that agents differ.\nSome persons in the body seem capable of acting as agents when others\nare not, and agents in the spirit similarly vary ; but while we can\nsuppose that the difficulty in the case of living agents is physical and\ndue to the agent's organism, we cannot thus account for it in the case\nof the dead. It is probable enough, however, that the difficulties may\nsometimes be psychical, especially as this would be analogous to our\nexperiences in daily life, when the difficulties human beings have in\nmaking themselves understood by one another are by no means only\nphysical.\nBut there is another factor playing an important part in the\nPiper sittings which has hardly, I think, received the consideration it\ndeserves, and to which these differences in the veridicality of the\ncommunications are evidently at least partly due, namely, the sitter.\nThe success of sitters in obtaining interesting communications varies,\nas we know, enormously, and there are persons who sit with Mrs.\nPiper\u2014have even sat often with Mrs. Piper\u2014and though they receive\nplenty of communications, receive none which there is the slightest\nreason to suppose supernormal at all. It is, I think, the case that the\nsitters who obtain most evidence of supernormal communication of\nsome kind are those whose sittings afford evidence of supernormal\nd 2\n\f36 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ncommunication of all kinds, both of thought-transference from the\nsitter and of communication with the dead or with distant living\nminds. If it were only a question of information derived by Mrs.\nPiper telepathically from the sitter, it would be easy to attribute the\nfailure of an unsuccessful sitter to his being a bad agent ; but a good\nsitter seems in some way to make the process of transmission easier,\neven when he does not seem to be the source of the information.\nI do not think Dr. Hodgson has attempted to explain this. He,\nof course, recognises the fact, and says, indeed (Proceedings XIII.,\np. 371), \"There are certain persons who appear to be almost entirely\nunsuccessful as regards communications from their ' deceased ' friends,\nand indeed at ' sittings' altogether, and from causes which apparently\ninhere in themselves.\" But these causes appear to Dr. Hodgson\u2014\njudging from what he says further on in the same paragraph\u2014to be\nsuch things as want of attention or of desire to succeed ; or, again, to\nquote his words, \" It may even be that the state of mind of some\npersons is actually repellent to the efforts which their 'deceased' friends\nmake to communicate.\" Such causes as these, no doubt, may operate,\nbut there is something more. I speak as one who has uniformly\nfailed, whether as agent or percipient in thought-transference experi\nments, or as sitter with Mrs. Piper and other mediums, and I am\nsure that the cause is not want of sympathy or desire to succeed, or\nbelief that success is possible. After years of failure the inevitable\nabsence of hope may have a damping effect, but this will not account\nfor failure when hope is still fresh. I think it is certain that the sitter\ndoes not serve only as an attraction to his deceased friends, but that,\n\u2014granting, as I am doing throughout, the genuineness of Mrs. Piper's\npower,\u2014there are subliminal qualities in the sitters which make the\nexercise of this power possible with some and not with others. Now\nthis is not, I think, consistent with the hypothesis that the commu\nnicator in the other world uses Mrs. Piper's organism directly ; for if\nso, why should it be more difficult for him to speak or write for A\nthan for B? We require a hypothesis which allows for all three\nminds\u2014the minds of the deceased friend, of Mrs. Piper, and of the\nsitter\u2014being subliminally concerned in the result.\nIn attempting to frame such a hypothesis, two things should, I\nthink, be borne in mind. First, I cannot but assume that, whatever\nother sources of information Mrs. Piper may draw from, she does\nsometimes draw telepathically from the sitter's mind. Evidence\nexcluding other possible sources of information is, almost necessarily,\nrare, but it is afforded when mistaken ideas of the sitters are\nreproduced. As instances of this I may refer to an experience of Pro\nfessor Newbold's, given in Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 9, 24 ; also to\nan attempt of G. P. to describe the contents of a letter presented by\n\fxxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 37\nMrs. Howard, when what G. P. said corresponded not with the actual\nletter, but with one which Mrs. Howard mistakenly thought she had\npresented (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 320).\nSecondly, our other investigations have produced some evidence,\nthough not a great deal, pointing to the possibility of telepathic com\nmunication between the dead and living persons in a normal condition\n(not entranced)\u2014evidence of the same kind, though much less in\namount and in cogency, as that which apparitions at the moment of\ndeath afford of telepathic communication between the dying and their\nliving friends. I do not propose to go into this here, and will only\nrefer the reader to a paper by Mr. Gurney and Mr. Myers on\n\" Apparitions occurring soon after Death,\" in Proceedings, Vol. V.,\nand to Chapter XVII. of the \" Report on the Census of Hallucina\ntions,\" Proceedings, Vol. X. I think now, as I and the other writers\nof the Report thought then, that the amount of evidence is not in\nitself sufficient to constitute anything like a conclusive case for post\nmortem agency. Still it should not be ignored.\nNow, obviously, if we once admit that telepathic impacts sometimes\nreach the normal consciousness of percipients through hallucinations,\nthere is no need to suppose that those which do so are all the telepathic\ncommunications which occur. An unknown proportion\u2014perhaps a\nvery largo proportion\u2014may, for aught we know, never rise above the\nsubliminal consciousness ; just as ideas suggested to a hypnotised\nperson may remain entirely unknown to him when he is awake, or may\nin some cases be brought to his waking knowledge by his own\nautomatic action or by a suggested hallucination.\nIf, then, it be granted that we are not without reason for thinking\nthat Mrs. Piper may be in telepathic communication with the sitter,\nand that the sitter may, without knowing it, be in telepathic relation\nwith his dead friends ; and also \u2014what seems to be certain\u2014that the\nsitter plays some important part in bringing about the results obtained\nthrough Mrs. Piper, is it not conceivable that his function is, to some\nextent, that of a channel of communication? The departed spirit\ncommunicates, we may suppose, telepathically directly with his friend\nthe sitter, but this communication is entirely subliminal, and the sitter\nis not normally conscious of it at all. Mrs. Piper in trance receives\ntelepathically impressions from some sitters which do rise, partially at\nleast, to her trance consciousness, and are then given back by her to\nthe sitter through the ordinary channels of sense in speech or writing.\nMrs. Piper in trance plays, on this hypothesis, a part analogous\nto that of a bad mirror reflecting very imperfectly the contents of the\nsitter's subliminal consciousness, coloured and distorted by the con\ntents of her own. She does for the sitter, in a different way, exactly\nwhat a veridical sensory hallucination does. Such a hallucination \u2014\n\f38 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nsay, an apparition at the moment of death\u2014is generally an embodi\nment of many associated ideas from the percipient's own mind\ncombined with what we may suppose to be the immediate result of\nthe telepathic communication from the dying person. The percipient\nwill see his friend most likely in clothes of a familiar aspect and with\na familiar expression, in a position fitting in with his own physical\nsurroundings ; all these adjuncts to the idea of the friend being\ngenerally, it would seem, due to the percipient's own associations with\nthe friend. Similarly we may suppose that Mrs. Piper derives from\nthe sitter impressions subliminally received by the latter from the\ndead, combined with ideas previously in the sitter's mind, and repro\nduces these further complicated by her own ideas. Sometimes\u2014indeed\ngenerally\u2014there would be no evidence of any communication from\nthe deceased, the sitter's own ideas being, so far as appeared, alone\nreflected. Further, it would not be at all inconsistent with the hypo\nthesis that Mrs. Piper should herself, as well as the sitter, receive\nin some instances direct communications from the dead. One result,\nwe may observe, would follow if the process resembles that which I\nsuggest. Mrs. Piper's trance personality would in the course of a\nseries of sittings gradually acquire as part of its own stock of ideas\na definite conception of the deceased agent, and as this happened, it\nwould become more and more difficult to distinguish veridical com\nmunications from those for which Mrs. Piper alone is responsible.\nAny hypothesis must, with the very small amount of knowledge\nwe at present have, be exceedingly tentative, and the one I have\nventured to suggest, if true at all, can only be a very rough approxi\nmation to the truth. The mere attempt to state it, probably gives a\nmisleading definiteness to things of which we have only a very dim\nperception. But I know of no other hypothesis which seems to me to\nfit at all even the very limited number of facts which we can regard\nas provisionally established, or legitimately assumed to be so for the\npurposes of the present discussion ; and I have ventured to bring it\nforward in the hope that it may suggest lines of observation and\nexperiment which may throw light on the very obscure and difficult\nquestions involved in Mrs. Piper's phenomena.\n\fxxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 39\nIII.\nDISCUSSION OF THE TRANCE PHENOMENA OF\nMRS. PIPER.\nIII.\u2014Reflections on Mrs. Piper and Telepathy.\nBy Andrew Lang.\n. In Dr. Hodgson's \" Further Record of Observations of Certain\nPhenomena of Trance\" (Proceedings, Part XXXIII., pp. 284-413), he\npromises to consider objections to his provisional hypothesis. Such\nobjections I venture to produce. In 1898 his hypothesis was that\n\"the chief communicators\" (with Mrs. Piper) \"are veritably the\npersonages that they claim to be \" (p. 406). This means, of course,\nthat, in Dr. Hodgson's opinion, Mrs. Piper is actually \" possessed \"\n(in the old phrase) by the spirits of the dead. This is indeed a\n\"far-going\" theory. But if we reject it, and also reject the idea\nthat Mrs. Piper is a conscious impostor, and in collusion, for example,\nwith such people as \" Mrs. Howard,\" we must try to produce some\nother hypothesis. The hypothesis of telepathy from the living has\nbeen advanced, and has been met by Dr. Hodgson with arguments\nof considerable force. Though I have no theory to offer myself,\nperhaps I may be allowed to make a few remarks on the problem ;\nespecially as regards the telepathic explanation. When I published\nThe Making of Religion in 1898, one of my purposes was to set\nforth alleged savage parallels to the \"psychical phenomena\" recorded\nby the Society as occurring among civilised peoples, European and\nAmerican. Among such phenomena occurs the \" possession \" of a\nhuman \" medium \" by a god or a ghost. When the medium at\nDelphi, or in modern Burmah, China, Polynesia, savage North\nAmerica, New Zealand, or Africa, becomes convulsive, and afterwards\nutters prophecies or other statements about what cannot normally\nbe known to him or her, the pre-scientific theory was that the organisa\ntion of the medium is being used by a god or spirit. But this\n\" spiritistic \" theory has been employed by mankind to explain\nalmost every kind of obscure phenomenon, and has in every field\nbeen rejected by science; apparently with justice. When the theory\nis now revived by Dr. Hodgson to account for the singular case of\nMrs. Piper, one cannot but regard it, a priori, with extreme\n\f40 Andrew Lang. [part\nsuspicion. There are other grounds for distrust. Thus Dr. Phinuit,\nthe soi-disant spirit of a French doctor, is notoriously ignorant of\nFrench, and not one of his statements about his earthly life admits\nof verification. He is, or was, not only vulgar beyond belief, but also\ntricky, evasive, false, dishonest. Thus Professor Peirce (May 1st, 1892)\nsays, after a \"sitting,\" \"Phinuit seemed to me to be constantly groping\nafter indications from me to correct and direct his intelligence, and\nin some cases he seemed to be so directed.\" The \"sitting\" is \"a\nstruggle for knowledge to which the sitter contributes.\"\nI know how much some Psycliical Researchers dislike evidence\nfrom anthropology, but a Zulu sitting with a possessed woman could\nnot be better described than in Professor Peirce's words. The sitters\nare expected to give indications by beating the ground when the\nseeress is right, and the seeress, like Mrs. Piper, constantly asks\ntentative questions. \"Who's Herbert?\" \"I get a Maria in your\nsurroundings ? \" with a pause of interrogation. This is Mrs. Piper's\nmethod: compare Callaway, Religion of the Amazulu, pp. 361-374.\nAs to the evidence for the Zulu method, it is explicitly set forth\nin Bishop Callaway's Zulu texts and translations ; or see Making\nof Religion, pp. 152, 153. The coincidence of Zulu and Piperian\nmethods is exact, as far as the \" struggle for knowledge to which the\nsitter contributes \" is concerned. Professor Trowbridge, again, was\n\"struck by a sort of insane cunning in the groping of the woman after\nsomething intangible \" (Proceedings, Part XXXIII., p. 526). Pro\nfessor Norton thought Mrs. Piper's conditions \"analogous to those of\nan ill person dreaming a suggested dream, in which trains of dreams\nto which the dreamer has been accustomed are modified by the special\nconditions of the moment.\" He made no doubt of Mrs. Piper's good\nfaith, but what is the good faith of \" an ill person \" in a dream\nmodified by the sitters?\nThus both Phinuit and Mrs. Piper's performances in general have\nproduced the worst impression on various and most intelligent\nobservers. Professor Macalister says : \" I let her see a blot of ink\non my fingers, and she said that I was a writer.\" This implies, of\ncourse, that, through her apparent trance, Mrs. Piper's normal self\nwas on this occasion wide awake and eager to catch at any knowledge\nthat could be normally acquired. Even if Mr. Macalister had been\nhappier in later sittings that blot remains indelible. Mr. Macalister\n\"thought the whole performance an imposture and a poor one.\"\nLater, an American author, cited as Mr. Marte, who knew \" G. P.,\"\n\" formed an opinion entirely unfavourable to Mrs. Piper.\" Dr. Weir\nMitchell is a thoroughly qualified observer as a physician and a\nman of the world, and he says that had he not heard Professor\nJames's statements, he would have come to the conclusion \" that the\n\fxxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 41\nwhole thing was a fraud and a very stupid one.\" Later sittings, of\ncourse, might have altered that opinion. [Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp.\n605-606 ; Part XXXIII., pp. 429-483). Mr. Barkworth, as far as his\nown experiences went, set down any successes to muscle-reading.\nI might quote many such results, but what chiefly confirmed my\nown suspicions were the so-called communications, through Mrs\nPiper, of Professor Oliver Lodge's deceased uncle. I have not space\nfor a detailed comparison of what Mrs. Piper said with what was\nsaid by a surviving brother of Mr. Lodge's uncle as to some in\ncidents of their distant boyhood. But lately I went through the\ntwo accounts with a member of the Society, certainly not prejudiced\nagainst Mrs. Piper, and I think he admitted that in only one case (the\npossession by the uncle of a dried snake skin) did the revelation of\nthe dead really harmonise with the recollections of the living kins\nman of Mr. Lodge. Of course, my memory may exaggerate. The\nevents, moreover (though they did not really occur at all as the dead\nuncle described them), were exactly such as do arise in the expe\nriences of almost every human boy. Readers can examine critically\nthe two statements, and decide for themselves (Proceedings, Vol.\nVI., pp. 465-557). For these and other reasons I conceived that\nPhinuit, at all events, was only a morbid secondary personality of\nMrs. Piper's. Now such personalities, or moods, or whatever we call\nthem, are notoriously apt to be dishonest, detestable, and the very\nreverse of the patient's normal character. The old English proverb\nsays \" Ale is another man \"\u2014that is, the alcoholic mood differs from\nthe normal personalty. The character of the dipsomaniac (say. Prince\nCharles Edward) is the precise contrary of the victim's original\ncharacter. To take a more recent instance. The Dundee Advertiser\nlately (December, 1899) published the sad story of a local artisan.\nHe got \" mad drunk,\" doubtless on some infamously adulterated\nwhisky, went home and beat his mother to death. He then strayed\nout, fell into some water, and on emerging knew what he had done.\nHe at once gave himself up to the police. Whisky was \"another\nman,\" and a much worse man.\nWorse, too, than the normal self of the patient is, as a rule, the\nnon-alcoholic \" secondary personality ; \" the \" preposterous scoundrel,\"\nas Professor Shaler calls Phinuit. In \" unfortunate subjects of\nabnormal conditions of the brain,\" says Mr. Huxley, \" the dis\nturbance of the sensory and intellectual faculties is not unfrequently\naccompanied by a perturbation of the moral nature, which may\nmanifest itself in a most astonishing love of lying for its own\nsake.\" He cites a case of a soldier whose left parietal bone was\nfractured by a bullet. In his normal life he is honest, intelligent,\nand kindly. In his abnormal intervals \"he is an inveterate thief,\"\n\f42 Andrew Lang. [part\nand all his proceedings present \" a close parallel to the phenomena\nof somnambulism and of mesmerism,\" including examples of strange\nlucidity. Mr. Huxley cites \" De l'Automatisme de la Memoire,\" by\nDr. Mesnef, in L'Union Medicate, July 21st, 23rd, 1874. His own\ntext is in Culture and Science, 223-231. The whole story is most\ncurious, and worthy of attention.\nNow not only is, or was, Phinuit dishonest and tricky, but even\n\"G. P.\" frequently gives absolutely false information when asked\nabout what is occurring at a distance. He says, for instance, that\nhis father is writing a letter (an easy guess) when he is not. The\nlate Mr. Moses, when invited to give the real names of Imperator and\nCo. (his \" controls \") gives wrong names. The attempts of G. P. to\ntranslate liartp i)fiSiv 6 iv rois ovpavo'a (Part XXX IV., p. 46; read as if\npart of Mrs. Piper's mind was guessing on the lines suggested by\nPater (pater noster). The false information is given with perfect\naplomb, and is \"not right, though natural enough,\" i.e., a deliberate\nguess (Part XXXIII., pp. 345, 346, 347). The communicator is\n\"Mr. H.\"\nWe are told that subtle traits of the dead are recognised by their\nfriends in these communications. Thus a husband recognised familiar\nphrases of his dead wife's, such as, \" Well, I should say I had ! \"\n\" Don't 1 1 \" \" Well, I guess ! \" (Proceedings, Part XXXIII., p. 504).\nBut surely these phrases are excessively common in the conversations\nof American women, if we may judge by the dialogue of American\nnovels. On the other hand, deliberate evasiveness and calm falsehood\nwere not the traits of G. P. and the rest when alive. Therefore I\nwould attribute these traits, at least, to Mrs. Piper's \" preposterous\nscoundrel \" of a secondary personality.\nThat spirits, in the next life, making use of Mrs. Piper's brains,\nnerves, voice, and hands, should be confused, is intelligible. But\nwhy should they be impudently mendacious, absurdly ignorant, and\nfurtively evasive ; fluent in twaddle, and \" groping \" when a simple\nquestion as to something familiar to them when alive is asked, that is,\nin many cases ?\nIf Mr. H., or Phinuit, or G. P. were honourable spirits, they would\nsay that they don't know, when they don't know. They would not\ngive false information, \" natural enough \" (easily guessed), but totally\nwrong. Such proceedings, on the other hand, are characteristic of a\nsecondary personality, which is occasionally supplied with right facts\nby guess, muscle-reading, or even telepathy. Dr. Hodgson has ably\nargued that the failures and confusions \" fit the claim \" of spirits,\nand do not fit the theory of telepathy (Part XXXIII., pp. 391-396).\nBut the points on which I have dwelt do assuredly harmonise with the\nnotorious character of the secondary personalities of people honest in\n\fxxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 43\ntheir normal state. And these points do not fit the character of\nhonourable spirits, eminently the reverse. Mr. Newbold insists on\nthis, in the case of Mr. Moses (Part XXXIV., p. 41). Indeed Mr.\nPodmore. with his views of the performances of the incarnate Mr.\nMoses (Part XXXIV., pp. 52-53) must regret that Mr. Moses and\nhis crew of \" controls \" have invaded Mrs. Piper.\nIn reviewing my book, The Making of Religion (Part XXXIV.,\np. 131) Mr. Podmore censures my remarks on Mrs. Piper (p. 151).\nDr. Hodgson's report (Part XXXIII.) came out, as I said, while my\nbook was passing through the press, and I had neither space nor time\nfor criticism. I merely said that the report did not win me to\nDr. Hodgson's opinion, namely, that the \" chief communicators \"\nwere spirits of the dead, and that I was sure my own dead friends\nwould steer clear of Mrs. Piper. I added that her interest for me was\n\" purely anthropological.\" If she deals with the dead, so, apparently,\ndo similar savage mediums. If the pretence is rejected in their\ncase, it will need a great deal of evidence to prove an exception for\nMrs. Piper.\nAnother example of this argument occurs. Speaking for the\n\"spirit\" theory, Dr. Hodgson says (Part XXXIII., p. 396) that the\nbest results are got by treating the communicators as if they really\nwere spirits. \"We should soothe him .... express sympathy,\"\nand so on. The Chinese know this, and, in using their peculiar\nplanchette, they adulate the communicators, and set out for them\nwine, fruit and cakes. Even English planchettists (not believing in\nspirits) address the \" communicators \" with flattery, and think that\nthe results are improved. Would Dr. Hodgson argue that they and\nthe Chinese are dealing with real spirits ? The argument seems as\ngood in one case as in the other,\u2014that is, granting the improvement\nin results.\nSo far, then, I think that the \" communicators,\" even the best, do\nshow notes of the dishonest secondary personality of Mrs. Piper.\nG. P., to be sure, recognises Phinuit as a real entity, a spiritual entity,\nand surely G. P. should know ! But, if so, how can we account for\nPhinuit's inability to prove that he ever existed on earth, and for his\nignorance of French 1 Dr. Hodgson says that many things are in\nexplicable by his theory of spirits, just as many \" biological incidents \"\nhave not been fully explained by the theory of evolution. (Part\nXXXIII., p. 406). But the things not accounted for by the theory of\nspirits are obviously of a morally suspicious nature, and include a very\nlow moral element. This is not, I am apt to think, the case with the\n\"biological incidents\" unexplained; perhaps it could not be. Still,\nthe spiritual supercheries, after the fullest allowance for the confusion\nof a spirit dealing with Mrs. Piper's body, donnent furieusenient a\n\f44 Andrew Lang. [PART\npenser. Thus it is odd that when asked to describe distant actions by\nMrs. Howard, G. P. should go wrong by a day, while he is quite awake\nto our mere human time when communicating in ordinary sittings\n(Part XXXIII., pp. 304-308). Perhaps he only succeeds, as is sug\ngested, when people are thinking \" strongly and emotionally \" of\nhim. (Let us remember this.) Still, why confuse the time? The\nvolubility of G. P. in platitude contrasts again, as I have said,\nunpleasantly with his accustomed hesitation when asked for a humble\ntest of his identity.\nThere is another point on which I venture to think that the\nwonted precision and fulness of Dr. Hodgson's notes are absent.\nWe need to know, in each case, whether the sitter did, or did not,\nhold Mrs. Piper's hand, and we also need to know how long the sitting\nwas in point of time. We must have information as to the chances of\nmuscle-reading.\nVery singular are the possibilities of muscle-reading, of which I\ngive an example. Experiments were recently made on a blind, deaf\nmute, a girl, to see whether she was utterly without hearing. She\nlooked pleased when music was played, annoyed or alarmed when\na hideous din was produced. But it was observed that she was\nthen holding the hand of a lady, her instructress. The lady being\nplaced at some distance, no sound that could be made affected the\nexpression of the child's face. No doubt her sense of touch was\nexceedingly keen, but so may be Mrs. Piper's, when entranced and in\ncontact with the hand of her \"sitter.\"1\nThough Mr. Podmore accuses me of \" liking my psychical bric-a-brac\nrestored and decorated,\" whereas Mrs. Piper's bric-a-brac is \" battered\nand worm-eaten,\" I do not feel guilty ! Even in a book written only\nfor entertainment (Hook of Dreamx and Ghostx), I investigated historical\ncases by the aid of MSS. and rare books, and Celtic living tradition.\nOvercoming the inexpressible tediousness and distastefulness of the\ntask, I have, in fact, several times read carefully through most of the\nPiper records. I must now confess that, taking the G. P. notes alone,\nI think there is primd facie reason for further inquiry. Dr. Hodgson\n1 The case referred to is that of n deaf, dumb, and blind American child, Helen\nKeller. See Mind, XIV., ji. 306. We read, \" Whereas Miss Sullivan\" (the lady\nwho instructed the child) \"had been disposed to credit her with some inexplicable\nmental faculty, it now appears, on closer observation, that her power of divining the\nthoughts of those she is with may be wholly explained by her acute perception of\ntheir muscular vibrations.\" I think I have rather overstated the case, because I\noriginally took it at second-hand from the conversation of a psyohologiea] friend, who\nlater supplied the exact reference. This is instructive, but it remains true that the\nchild showed signs of appreciating sounds when she held Miss Sullivan's hand ;\nand not when Miss Sullivan placed her hands on a table. If Miss Roller is alive\nand well, experiments a la Piper might be made with her, if she entertains no\nobjection.\n\fxxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 45\nshows, moreover, that written reports cannot convey the same impres\nsion as is produced by years of personal experience ; and there must\nhe strong evidence in what overpowers his scepticism. Again, we are\nnot permitted to know, as he knows, the most telling evidence, and\nthat must be allowed for in our conclusions.\nI do not think that the normal Mrs. Piper makes private inquiries.\nThat hypothesis I gladly discard. In the case of G. P. we learn\n(Part XXXIII., p. 295) that he died by an accident, in New York, in\nFebruary, 1892. Mrs. Piper was then in New York, and probably read\nabout the affair (G. P. being, apparently, a more or less notable\nperson), in the newspapers. She could, if she chose, make inquiries ;\nshe might hear gossip (though I lay no stress on this), and G. P. did\nnot begin to possess her till several weeks later. But I do not\nsuppose that Mrs. Piper heard of Mr. Hart's studs (once G. P.'s), or\nof \" Katherine,\" and of circumstances connected with her which Mr.\nHart did not know that he knew, and probably never had known. I\nwould incline to explain these things (Part XXXIII , pp. 297-298) by\nmuscle-reading (if Mr. Hart held Mrs. Piper's hand, about which\nnothing is said), or by telepathy. In M. Bourget's case, his hand was\nin that of Mrs. Piper, and she took a very long time to give him\ninformation which he certainly thought surprising.\nProbably Dr. Hodgson ought to record the time occupied in a\nconversation which may look very short in print, and certainly we\nshould know whether the sitter held Mrs. Piper's hand or not. These\nfacts Dr. Hodgson must have known in M. Bourget's case ; my recol\nlection is that M. Bourget told me that he held Mrs. Piper's hand, and\nthat the sitting was fairly long. He remained, even so, unable to\nexplain the results, as he has said in print (Figaro, January 14th,\n1895 ; Proceedings, Part XXXIII., pp. 495-499).\nI recognise the importance of the case of Mr. Hart, Katherine,\nand G. P.'s studs, and of similar examples.\nWe now come to the Howards, who did not see Mrs. Piper till\nabout three weeks after Mr. Hart. Here, again, I do not know if these\nmost intimate acquaintances of G. P. held Mrs. Piper's hand during\nthe sittings, nor is the time occupied by the conversations given.\nThese details ought, I venture to think, to be recorded. On the\nhypothesis of Mrs. Howard's collusion, almost all the mystery vanishes.\n[ believe in no such matter (knowing, as I do, nothing about Mrs.\nHoward). In no such matter do \/ believe, but it is, to the sceptic, a\ntheory more acceptable than the theory of possession by the soul of a\ndead man. But, in the case of collusion, Mrs. Howard (Part XXXIII.,\np. 306) would have told Mrs. Piper what she was going to do on April\n28th (when Mrs. Howard was to have a sitting), not what she did on\nApril 27th. It was what she did on April 27th, that G. P. described\n\f46 Andrew Lang. [part\nas events of April 28th. Dr. Hodgson, in a similar case, suggests that\nPhinuit was \" getting glimpses into the mind of Mrs. Holmes, was\nreading off some of her past experiences\" (Part XXXIV., p. 307).\nSo Mrs. Piper may have read in Mrs. Howard's mind, on the 27th,\nand transferred the results to the 28th, time being perhaps rather\nmixed to her secondary self. Mrs. Piper's \"secondary personality\"\nwas as likely to do all this as G. P. was ; atid he is rather less of a vera\ncausa. Phinuit, by the way (Part XXXIII., p. 314) does not seem to\nhave known that G. P. knew Greek, and, indeed, in the next world he\nknows very little.\nIn all cases, knowledge by G. P. of what occurs here, at a distance\nfrom his sitter, seems to be \"obtained indirectly and telepathically\nthrough the minds of living people, rather than by a direct visual\nperception, such as we enjoy\" (Dr. Hodgson, Part XXXIII., p. 315).\nIf this be true, why suppose a surviving G. P. at all ? Mrs. Piper's\nown \" secondary personality \" may be able to do all that G. P. (on the\nanimistic hypothesis) is supposed to do, \u2014for example, could reel off, by\naid of telepathy, the long private communications to Mr. Howard who\nwas present (Part XXXIII., p. 322). G. P. was strongest with his\nmost intimate friends, and I admit that one does not see why this\nshould be so, if G. P. is only a function of Mrs. Piper's secondary\n. personality. That fact, certainly, seems to be against the hypothesis\nof mere telepathy between the living. We can scarcely argue that\nG. P.'s friends only happened to succeed best with Mrs. Piper.\nThis brings us to the question whether Mrs. Piper's remarkable,\nthough direly interrupted, successes, say with G. P., are due to\ninformation from the spirit of that gentleman, or to telepathy on the\nside of Mrs. Piper, tapping, as it were, the minds not only of living\npersons beside her, and often known to her, but also of living persons\ndistant, and unknown to her, though known to people in her room.\nTo this obviously wild hypothesis we are almost driven, if we reject\nthe theory of fraud, and the theory of communicating spirits of\nthe dead.\nThe hypothesis of fraud rests on a vera causa ; thus we might\nsay that Robert Houdin was bribed to give a false testimonial to the\nclairvoyance of Alexis Didier. On David Hume's theory, a long set\nof impostures is the most legitimate explanation of Mrs. Piper's\nsuccesses. For reasons given by Dr. Hodgson, I cannot accept the\ntheory of imposture by Mrs. Piper, in her normal state. For one\nthing she could not afford the expense of private inquiries, which\nwould more than swallow up the profits.\nTurning, then, to telepathy, Dr. Hodgson argues that there are\nlimitations, which gradually disappear, in the news given by persons\nrecently dead, and there are limitations at first sittings. (Part\n\fxxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 47\nXXXIII., p. 392.) Moreover, good telepathic living agents (as they\nseem to be) fail constantly with certain dead \"communicators.\" But\nG. P. was very lucid at first, though recently dead, and dead by an\naccident. \"First sittings,\" \"first communicators,\" again, may be\nconfused, but the confusion may be due to the living \"agents\"; in\nfact, as far as I see, the failure may always be due to living agents,\ndealing with another living agent, Mrs. Piper. We know so very little\nabout telepathy that we can hardly argue on this side of the matter at\nall. Possibly I fail to grasp Dr. Hodgson's full meaning in pages\n391-393. \" That memories of little children recently dead should have\na special telepathic agency\" seems extremely natural, just as G. P.\nis said to succeed most when people are thinking \" strongly and\nemotionally \" of him. People do think \" strongly and emotionally \" of\ndead children, and, perhaps, that kind of thought of the living sitter is\nmost readily caught by Mrs. Piper. Just so, if persons who died as\nchildren forget childish things, as we are told, that may be because\nthe survivors, after many years, have themselves forgotten them\n(though the subliminal self never forgets), and cannot wire them to\nMrs. Piper by telepathy or muscle-reading. Regarding the effect as if\nof real traits of the personality of the dead, produced on the living\nwho knew them, it is evidence, I fear, only for the survivors them\nselves. On the other hand, it is not like the late G. P., it was no trait\nof his, to give false information with aplomb, nor was it like the late\nMr. H. to repeat, as true, what was only a \" natural \" guess. ^Thus the\nsitter who knew the dead, may think he recognises personal traits.\nBut this may be due to his own memory of these traits, which are\ntelepathically reproduced by Mrs. Piper, or due to self-delusion, and\ncertainly other very important moral traits of the dead are often\nreversed, and unrecognisable.\nWe are dealing here with a most imperfectly known agency,\ntelepathy ; with a better-known agency, the secondary personality ;\nand with another wholly unknown agency, spirits of the dead. The\npreference for any of these Laputan alternatives is apt to be decided\nby personal bias. But, to a faint extent, telepathy has the advantage\nof being a vera causa. The advocates of telepathy, attempting to\nexplain Mrs. Piper's successes, may fall back, as Dr. Hodgson says,\non \"the hypothesis of telepathy from the living, that the subliminal\nconsciousness of the sitters, and also of distant living persons, might\nhe drawn upon by the living.\" Thus, Mr. Pelham is doing something,\nin Washington, with a photograph of his son, G. P., and G. P. reports\nthis, at Boston, through Mrs. Piper. The explanation (apart from\nguess or collusion) will be that Mrs. Piper got at the subliminal con\nsciousness of the remote Mr. Pelham, and so on in other similar\ncases. Such a telepathic explanation is \" to the Greeks foolishness.\"\n\f48 Andrew Lang. [part\nDr. Hodgson (Part XXXIII., p. 393) cites Mr. Oliver Lodge thus :\n\" It ought to be constantly borne in mind that this kind of thought-\ntransference, without consciously active agency, has never been\nexperimentally proved. ' How can you experiment consciously in\nthe unconscious ? But Dr. Hodgson adds that the successes and\nfailures do not show any direct relation to the conscious minds of\nthe sitters. Clairvoyance of Mrs. Piper's, or communication between\nher and the subliminal self of Mr. Pelham, would cover the case of\nthe photograph at Washington, without calling up the ghost of G. P.\nBut, suppose G. P. communicates to Mrs. Piper what is unknown to\nthe sitter, but known to A. or B. at a distance, who are known to the\nsitter. Can telepathy be forced to cover that 1\nDr. Hodgson puts the case thus : \" We must then make the\narbitrary suppositions that Mrs. Piper's percipient personality gets\ninto relation with the minds of distant living persons, (1) who are\nintimate friends of the sitters, at the time of the sitting \" (as in the\ncase of Mr. Hart, who knew the Howards), \" and (2) who are scarcely\nknown, or not at all known, to the sitter,\" but, in one of two cases at\nleast, were known to Dr. Hodgson, who was present (Part XXXIII.,\np. 394, p. 372). All this would imply \"a selective and discriminative\ncapacity in Mrs. Piper's percipient personality \" (as in the personality\nof whoever inflicts a telepathic hallucination on a person at a distance),\nand, widening this theory to cover all cases, \" we reach a conception\nwhich goes as far as the 'spirit ' hypothesis itself.\"\nThe conception does go as far,\u2014but not in the same direction. It\nstretches a more or less accepted hypothesis, \u2014telepathy ; it does not\nintroduce an old but discredited hypothesis, the direct action of\nthe dead.\nNow the stretching of the telepathic hypothesis was almost\nforced on me (if I was to have any hypothesis) during Miss Angus's\nexperiments with a glass ball. I presume that these experiments\nwere \" experimental,\" in Mr. Lodge's sense of the word, but I am not\ncertain. (Making of Religion, pp. 94-112.) There was in these\nexperiments, apparently, \"a selective and discriminative capacity in\n'Miss Angus's' percipient personality.\" But there was no room for\nthe theory of the spirits of the dead, for all concerned were alive. To\nbe sure the Polynesians explain all water-gazing by a theory of spirits,\nbut Dr. Hodgson will not agree with the Polynesians (Ellis, Poly\nnesian Researches, II., p. 240).\nAgain and again Miss Angus, sitting with man or woman, described\nacquaintances of theirs, but not of hers, in situations not known to\nthe sitters, but proved to be true to fact. Now the \" far-going \"\nhypothesis of direct clairvoyance was here excluded (in most cases, not\nall) by conditions of time. In one instance Miss Angus described\n\fxxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 49\ndoings from three weeks to a fortnight old, of people in India, people\nwhom she had never seen or heard of, but who were known to her\n\" sitter.\" Her account, given on a Saturday, was corroborated by a\nletter from India which arrived next day, Sunday. In another case\nshe described (about 10 p.m.) what a lady, not known to her, but the\ndaughter of a matron present (who was not the sitter), had been doing\nabout 4 p.m. on the same day. What the person seen was doing was\nnot a thing familiar, for I asked that question. Again, \" sitting \"\nwith one lady, Miss Angus described a singular set of scenes much in\nthe mind, not of her \"sitter,\" but of a very unsympathetic stranger,\nwho was reading a book at the other end of the room. I have tried\nevery hypothesis, normal and not so normal, to account for these and\nanalogous performances of Miss Angus. There was, in the Indian\nand other cases, no physical possibility of collusion ; chance coincidence\ndid not seem adequate ; ghosts were out of the question, so was direct\nclairvoyance. That Miss Angus (who, by the way, was in the most\nnormal and wide-awake condition) had got into touch with the\nAbsolute, and was making discriminating selections from the stores of\nOmniscience, did not seem likely, because her crystal pictures appeared\nto be directed by the mind of a person present, not always the sitter.\nNothing remained for the speculative theoriser but the idea of cross\ncurrents of telepathy, between Miss Angus, a casual stranger, the\nsitters, and people far away, known to the sitters or the stranger,\nbut unknown to Miss Angus. Unpublished examples of these things\nwent on the same lines. Miss Angus picked up facts, unknown to the\nsitters, about people known to them but not to her.\nNow, suppose that Miss Angus, instead of dealing with living\npeople, by way of visions, had dealt by way of voice, or automatic\nhandwriting, and had introduced a dead \" communicator.\" Then\nshe would have been on a par with Mrs. Piper, yet with no aid\nfrom the dead. Her cases do not differ from Mrs. Piper's cases,\nexcept in copiousness, and in the circumstance that her condition\nwas normal, and that she was new to all such exercises. Of\ncourse, like Mrs. Piper, she had failures. I asked her to try to\nsee the room of a person known to me by correspondence only,\na person whom I never met (it was a room in Africa, though\nof course I did not say so), and she failed. It was trying her\nrather high. We did not seek to improve the result by exclaiming\n\" Dear Tom, Dick, or Harry, in Bengal, Edinburgh, or the Soudan, or\nthe Red Sea, do try to appear more frequently in the glass,\" as Dr.\nHodgson addresses the dead \" communicators.\" We could not do that,\nbecause the essence of the game lay in Miss Angus's ignorance about\nDick, Harry, and Tom, who were kept private in the mind of the\nsitter. Otherwise the performances of Mrs. Piper and Miss Angus\n\f50 Andrew Lang. [part\nwere on a par (except for the deadness of the persons concerned),\ngranting the difference of the methods of crystal-gazing, on one hand,\nand of trance-speaking, or automatic writing, on the other.\nNot to rely solely on Miss Angus, I take another instance. My\nfriend Mr. Lesley is known to the world as a man of business, a\ngolfer, and a composer. He can see crystal-pictures, but (like most\nof my acquaintances who possess the faculty, including my cook) has\nhardly any interest in the practice. One day Mr. Lesley and I had\nbeen talking about a lady, unknown to him, but known to me, though\nI had never seen her house. Mr. Lesley began to look into a glass\nwater-jug, and described what he saw, the interior of the hall of a\nhouse, with a good deal of detail. Neither of us recognised the\nhouse. I happened later to tell this to the lady of whom we had been\ntalking; she said, \" Whv_\u00ab+hat is -w*u_house,\" and, on visiting it, I\nfound that in all respects it \"answ&^jTffcvMr. Lesley's description.\nIt may be a commah^ype of hall, but I HiLwt remember having seen\none like it elsewherfe, nor\u00abtli\u00bblpi\\tj_liOsieyjkn^Tw\\any such place.\nNow, suppose tlVaj^the lady who occupied tMe house had been dead.\nAnd suppose that, instead of looking at a%biss water-jug, Mr. Lesley\nhad gone into a trkrtQe,Jaa\\T^iujJW^{c^j)r that the dead lady was\nspeaking with his voice. utlp[iii\u00ab\"*fof^vhen asked for a test she had\ndescribed the hall in her house (which was unknown to me and Mr.\nLesley) with certain curious details. Would not Dr. Hodgson argue\nthat this might be better explained by the hypothesis of communica\ntion through her spirit than by telepathy between Mr. Lesley and\nanybody not present who knew the house 1 Yet, as its owner was\nand is alive, the theory of a spirit is wholly impossible, and if not\ntelepathy a trots, then some other non-spiritualist theory must account\nfor the facts, as for the facts in Miss Angus's cases.\nMiss Angus's successes may not be due to cross-telepathy, nor may\nMr. Lesley's success ; very likely that is the wrong explanation. But\nof all known \" supernormal\" explanations, that alone is viable, in these\ninstances, and it is not, I think, incapable of application to Mrs.\nPiper's cases. Of course I do not reject the explanation by spirits,\nin Mrs. Piper's case ; I only state the objections which occur to me,\ncombined with the fact that Mrs. Piper is saturated with the animistic\nhypothesis, and has a dishonest secondary personality, if not dozens\nof such personalities. In Miss Angus's performances Mr. Podmore\nsuggests (Part XXXIV., p. 130) my own provisional guess of\ntelepathy a trois. It is a guess, even a wild Laputan conjecture\nBut we are here concerned with Laputan themes and speculations ;\nlike Mr. Darwin, we are making \"fools' experiments.\" Dr. Hodgson's\nhypothesis may be right ; but, in this region of dreams, we ought to\nhold very lightly by all hypotheses : and, surely, we ought not to\n\fxxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 51\nargue from one of them in favour of that old belief, the posthumous\nexistence of the human spirit, and its power of communicating with\nthe living, through a living organism. This is to base faith on a\nconjecture about conjectures. Moreover, in ordinary normal material,\nsuch as philological or anthropological speculation, we often see how\nscience overshoots her mark, remaining for a generation in sure\nconfidence about a theory which the next generation explodes. \"We\nought not to let our psychical theories affect our practical beliefs. To\ndo that may be to prepare for ourselves, or for our successors, a cruel\ndisappointment.\nMy objections are tendered with the consciousness that Mrs. Piper's\ncommunications, to Mr. Howard, for example, are far more copious\nand minute than the visions of the crystal ball gazer. But the two\nsets of automatisms have common features in the way of picking up\nknowledge, not, in many cases, possessed by the sitter, though familiar\nto some other living person. And as spirits can (I suppose) have\nnothing to do with this in the crystal cases, they may have nothing to\ndo with it in that of Mrs. Piper. Moreover, the visions in the glass\nball did not play tricks, or give false information. You, the sitter,\nmight think of Tom or Dick, and nothing might appear at all in the\nglass, or something quite unknown to everybody might appear. But\nDick or Tom were not seen in situations which they never occupied, or\nin actions which they never attempted, except perhaps in two cases,\napparently suggested by the expectations of the sitters. Possibly these\ncases of cross-telepathy may be to the point. On Dr. Hodgson's side,\nMrs. Piper's re-creation of a personality, such as G. P., for example, is,\nat his best, seems indeed a very difficult argument for an objector to\nmeet. Moreover, the conceivable \" form of consciousness \" of Mrs.\nPiper, \" like a dome of many-coloured glass,\" with colours corre\nsponding, more or less, to many personalities of the dead, is indeed\n\" very much an unknown quantity.\" Alas, the whole problem is a\nseries of unknown quantities ! We remain none the less grateful to\nDr. Hodgson for such disinterested labour in a region which Professor\nShaler, most naturally, found uninteresting, because \" I don't see how\nI can exclude the hypothesis of fraud.\" Frauds by secondary person\nalities, I fear, can hardly be excluded. We are like Porphyry, so many\ncenturies ago, in his wrestlings with \"lying spirits.\" But, unlike\nPorphyry, Dr. Hodgson has not been discouraged.\nSince writing this paper I have been allowed to see in proof\nMrs. Henry Sidgwick's \" Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of\nMrs. Piper.\" l We agree as to the notes of the \" secondary per\nsonality \" of Mrs. Piper among her professed communications from\n1 That is, the paper printed above, immediately preceding Mr. Lang's.\u2014Ed.\nE 2\n\f52 Andrew Lang. [part\nthe dead. We agree in not accepting the savage theory of \" posses\nsion,\" at least at present. But granting telepathy a trois (which\nis a great deal to grant), I see no reason for the hypothesis that\nMrs. Piper ever receives telepathic communications from the dead.\nHas she ever communicated a single thing that was known to a\ndead person, but to no living man or woman ? Such are my doubts ;\nmy bias is a desire not to believe that the dead are in any way\nmixed up with sittings at so many dollars. It would not surprise me\nif some normal explanation (at which I cannot guess) were finally to\nbe found for even the most puzzling of all these phenomena. I am not\nquite such a failure as Mrs. Sidgwick is personally as an intermediary\nin these experiments. Twice my thought has (apparently, and in the\nabsence of any other hypothesis known to me) been \"picked up\" by\nan experimenter, and in neither case was it my surface thought.\nThese things bias one in favour of the belief that there is something\nhere into which it may not be waste of time to inquire.\n\fxxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 53\nIV.\nON SOME PHILOSOPHIC ASSUMPTIONS IN THE\nINVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM OF A FUTURE LIFE.\nBy F. C. S. Schiller.\nThere is always a flavour of impertinence about the intervention of\na philosopher in a subject of scientific research. He cannot, as such,\nmake original contributions to the facts, and when he makes an\nattempt to criticise the contributions of others, he is terribly prone to\ndo so from the a priori basis of some far-fetched cosmic theory which\nnobody else in the world besides himself believes in or even under\nstands, and so becomes comic instead of cosmic. If, again, he contents\nhimself with ponderously pondering on the accepted facts of a science\nhe becomes a bore, consuming time and getting into the way of more\npractical workers.\nIt seems clear, therefore, that the usefulness of a philosopher is\nvery limited. It is undeniable only in cases where he is needed to\nclear out of the way other philosophers who have become obstreperous\nand obstructive; but for the moment there did not seem to be anybody\nin sight whom the spirit had moved to vilipend Psychical Research\na priori, and who, therefore, required to have the error of his ways\nbrought home to him in technical language.\nHence I was somewhat at a loss to see why the Council of the\nS.P.R. should have deemed it expedient to request me (at very short\nnotice) to write a paper, the purely theoretical character and hurried\ncomposition of which demand, I feel, the most abject apology. Indeed,\nI could not have been induced to say anything at all, but for the\nfact that philosophy seems to me to have also a function, not yet\nmentioned, which may enable it to be scientifically suggestive and\nserviceable, at all events at a certain stage in the development of a\nscience.\nThe function in question is that of discussing the working methods\nof a science, of exhibiting their full scope and logical implications and\nconnections, and considering the merits of the alternative ways of\ntreating the subject. Such a critical methodology of a science is\nnecessarily dull, but, perhaps, on that account, all the better adapted\nfor philosophic discourse. And in view of the intellectual myopia\nwhich scientific specialism engenders, there are, perhaps, few things\nmore salutary, as an unpleasant medicine is salutary, than for a\n\f54 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\nscience to become conscious of the working assumptions, or, if you\nwill permit me so to call them, the methodological postulates, on which\nit proceeds.\nIn the case of Psychical Research, in particular, the discussion of\nsuch methodological assumptions seems to be more novel, easier and\nmore useful than in disciplines which have reached a more assured\nposition among the sciences. It is likely to be more novel, because of\nthe novelty of the whole subject. It is likely to be easier to dissect out\nand contemplate in abstraction the methodological assumptions of an\ninchoate and infant science, because its organism is not so strongly\nknit and the flesh of fact does not so closely shroud the bone of method\nby which it is supported ; it is still in a low stage of organisation in\nwhich the whole may be taken to pieces and put together without\nmuch injury to the vitality of its parts. An advanced science on the\nother hand is far more difficult to handle : it imposes on the philosophic\ncritic by its very mass of coherent and consistent interpretation ; it\nappeals to him by its noble record of service to the human race ; it\ncrushes him by the sheer weight of immemorial authority. In it facts\nand theories have long been welded together into so indissoluble a union\nthat the former can no longer be questioned, while the latter have for\nthe most part risen to the dignity of indispensable ' necessary truths '\nimplied in the very nature of the human mind and underlying the\nwhole structure of human knowledge. We gain little help therefore\nfrom the assumptions of sciences like mathematics and mechanics in\nconsidering what assumptions should be made in a new subject like\nPsychical Research ; we learn little about the making of a science\nfrom sciences which can neither be unmade nor remade, and in whose\ncase it requires a considerable effort of philosophic thought to realise\nthe methodological character of their fundamental postulates. More\nmight perhaps be learnt from the assumptions of parvenu sciences\nwhich have but recently obtained full recognition, but for the fact\nthat a critical dissection of their methods is decidedly dangerous.\nFor the \" arbor scitmtiae \" seems in their case to have developed a\nsymbiotic arrangement greatly resembling that whereby certain trees\nprotect themselves ; just as any attack on the latter is ferociously\nresented by a host of ants which the tree provides with food and\nshelter, so any interference with such a science is sure to draw\ndown upon the mildest critic the onslaught of an infuriated pro\nfessor who lives upon the science. In Psychical Research, on the\nother hand, no such danger is to be apprehended ; we have not yet\ndeveloped any professionals whose mission it is, as William James has\nwittily remarked,1 to kill out the layman's general interest in the\n1 Human Immortality, init.\n\fxxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 55\nsubject, and hence the philosopher may proceed at his leisure to observe\nhow the science is made and to try instructive experiments with its\nworking methods, without fear of offending vested interests.\nAgain a philosophic discussion of possible methods is likely to be\nmore useful in Psychical Research because such methods are still\nplastic cartilage, as it were, which has not yet grown into rigid bone,\nand may be moulded into a variety of forms. Hence by reflecting\nbetimes upon the advantages of alternative methods, the philosopher\nmay flatter himself that he can be of real service in guiding the\ncourse of investigation, or at least in helping it to avoid certain\npitfalls. Not, of course, that even here he would be wise to pre\nsume to lay down the law a priori as to the actual working and\nmerits of the various methods ; he should content himself with\nexpounding the logical characteristics which sound methods in\nPsychical Research must possess, and explaining why exactly they\nmust possess them.\nI do not propose, however, on this occasion to discuss the\nmethodological value of the assumptions made in Psychical Research\ngenerally, but only in so far as they affect the question of a future\nlife. The reasons for this are obvious. The possibility of a future life\nprovides the motive force in our inquiries. It is true that the S.P.R.\nis unique in aiming to solve this problem in a scientific way, but\nthough we are scientific, we may yet be honest\u2014in avowing the\nexistence of a practical motive. If attacked on this score, let us meet\nour critics with the doctrine that in this respect at least we are not\nunique, inasmuch as in the end all true science is inspired by practical\nmotives, and that it is the fear, no less than the hope, of a future life\nthat renders its possibility so urgent a subject for scientific considera\ntion. Moreover, just now the evidence in connection with Mrs. Piper's\ntrances seems to have brought this possibility well above the horizon\nof the S. P. R., while at the same time much confusion and prejudice\nstill seem to prevail about it which philosophic criticism may help to\ndissipate.\nI may begin by passing over with a merely formal mention the\nassumptions which are required for every scientific investigation. As\na matter of course we must assume that the phenomena under\ninvestigation are knowable and rational in the sense of being amenable\nto determinable laws. The need for this assumption is so plain that\na priori attacks on Psychical Research on the score of undermining\nthe fundamental principle of all scientific research can hardly be put\ndown to anything but voluntary or involuntary ignorance of the\ngrossest kind.\nNext we must enunciate a methodological axiom with which at\nfirst sight few will be disposed to quarrel, viz., that we must proceed to\n\f56 F. G. S. Schiller. [part\nthe unknown from what is known to us. The remark is Aristotle's,1\nand I may be suspected of quoting it merely because Oxonians can.\nbut rarely resist the temptation of quoting Aristotle. But in reality\nit is not such a truism as it appears, at least in the meaning I propose\nto put upon it. It means in this connection that, both psychologically\nand logically, we must interpret any supposed future life by the know\nledge we have acquired of our present life. It is a methodological\nnecessity, in other words, that we must project this world into the\nnext, if ever we purpose scientifically to know it. Our assumption may\nbe wrong in the sense that it may be wrecked on barrier reefs of im\npenetrable fact\u2014possibly it will be\u2014but, right or wrong, we can work\nwith no other at the outset. As we go on we shall no doubt detect the\ninitial crudities of our assumptions, and correct them as our knowledge\ngrows. But whatever differences we may discover between the two\nworlds must rest upon the postulate of a fundamental identity, in\ndefault of which our reason would be merely paralysed. From a\ncomplete otherness of the other world nothing would follow ; a future\nlife in which everything was utterly different would mean nothing to\nus, and in proportion as the difference grows the practical efficacy and\ntheoretical knowableness of the conception diminish.\nNow this, I venture to think, is a philosophic result of considerable\npractical importance.\n( 1 ) It goes a long way towards explaining the anomaly of the feeble\nness of most people's religious beliefs about the future life. For the\nheavens and hells of the various religions, in spite of their pretensions\nto evoke forces which should utterly dwarf the three-score years and\nten of our mortal life, are found in practice to constitute motives so\nweak that they are continually routed and set aside by the trivial\ntemptations of the moment. The reason is that they have ordinarily\nbeen conceived as differing too radically from the known conditions of\nlife to excite the same serious belief, to require the same matter-of-fact\nforethought as, e.g., next year's crops or to-morrow's money market.\nAnd so the belief in a future life, even where it has not been degraded\ninto a merely verbal assent to a traditional formula, has commonly\nlacked that intimacy of association with the ordinary concerns of life\nwhich is needed to render it psychologically efficacious as a motive\nto action.\n(2) Again, it turns out that the spiritists were by no means wrong\nin principle when they proceeded to construe the future life, of which\nthey believed themselves to possess cogent evidence, very much on the\nlines of our earthly life. Their constructions may in detail be as crude\nand absurd as their adversaries allege\u2014I am neither familiar enough\n1 Eth. Nich. i, 3, 5.\n\fxxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 57\nwith the literature to discuss this point nor convinced that they are\u2014\nbut it is a mistaken prejudice to reject such accounts a priori as too\ntrivial or undignified to be ascribed to the inhabitants of another\nworld. Owing, no doubt, to the unduly tragic view we have come to\ntake of death, the prejudice that the decease of Brown, Jones and\nRobinson must instantly transmute them into beings of superhuman\npowers and tastes, and transport them into regions where they are\ninitiated into the uttermost ecstasies and agonies of the scheme of\nthings, has become almost universal. Indeed, I have often been\namused to see how strongly this notion influences people who are really\nentire disbelievers in the possibility of any future life ; while scorning\neverything ' supernatural,' they reject the spiritist's version thereof as\nnot supernatural enough, because they are quite sure that if there were\na future life at all, it would have to be as full of angels and demons\nas what they would call ' the traditional mythologies.' In a more\nrespectable form the same feeling shows itself in the large number of\npersons who refuse to accept the evidence, e.g., in the Piper case,\nbecause they do not like the sort of life to which it seems to point.\nThis may seem a somewhat naive ignoratio elenchi, but the psychical\nresearcher can hardly afford to smile at it, for he is continually having\nit impressed upon him how very serious are the obstacles which pre\njudices of this sort form to the discovery and recognition of the facts,\nand how manifestly the ' will to believe ' is the ratio cognoscendi of\ntruth. Hence a systematic challenge of the whole assumption that\nanother world must be as different as is conceivable (or rather incon\nceivable) from this, may serve to clear the atmosphere.\nAnd inasmuch as the groundlessness of a false assumption is never\nrevealed more clearly than by a request for the reasons on which it\nrests, I should like, for my own part, to add to the general challenge\na particular request, asking philosophers to show cause why a hypo\nthetical ' other ' world must necessarily be conceived as out of time\nand out of space. The conviction that this must be so underlies, I\nam sure, much of the high philosophic scorn of empirical spiritism and\npopular theology, but I do not think it would be easy to support it by\na valid and cogent philosophic argument. For so long as temporality\nand spatiality form indispensable characteristics of the only world we\nexperience, the presumption surely is that they will pervade also any\nother, until at least a definite method has been suggested whereby\nthey may be transcended.\n(3) Thirdly, it must be recognised that the methodological principle\nof interpreting the unknown by the known tells strongly in favour of\nthe simpler, and prhnd facie easier, theory of the agency of personal\nspirits as against the more complex and unfamiliar notions of an\nimpersonal clairvoyance, or subliminal consciousness, or non-human\n\f58 F. C. S. Schiller. [PaRT\nmodes of cognition by gods, devils or cosmic principles of a more or\nless unknowable kind. I am very far from thinking that we should in\nsuch matters hastily commit ourselves to the interpretation which\nprimd facie seems the most plausible, or, indeed, to any definitive\ntheory whatsoever, and I should be sorry to see the ingenious attempts\nto provide a non-spiritistic explanation of the phenomena in question\nprematurely abandoned\u2014if only on account of their excellence as\nmental gymnastics\u2014but I cannot admit that such attempts are one\nwhit less anthropomorphic in principle than the ' spiritist ' hypothesis\n(they only stray further from their human model), while I cannot help\nadmitting that methodologically they are more cumbrous and so\nconsiderably inferior.\nAdmitting, therefore, that as a working theory the hypothesis of\nthe persistence after death of what we call the human personality\npossesses considerable advantages over rival theories, let us inquire\nfurther by what methods, resting on what postulates, that theory may\nbe verified.\n(1) We may rule out once more the notion that such a future life\nis essentially supernatural in character. This notion has been a\nfavourite with believers, but it is easily turned into a terrible weapon\nin the hands of their adversaries. For the supernatural is, as such,\nincapable of investigation, and belief in it must be mere faith, exposed\nto every doubt and jeer, if, indeed, it can be even that, seeing that\na real faith must be nourished by at least partial and prospective\nverification in fact. Hence the answer to this notion is simply this :\nthat if the future life be really ' supernatural ' in the sense of having\nno connection of any sort with nature, there could not possibly he any\nevidence of it, and it would have to be for us non-existent ; while if\nthere be evidence of it, this would ipso facto include it in the widest\nconception of nature, and render the nature of the connection between\nthis world and the next a legitimate subject for scientific research.\nIf, therefore, the connection be rare and precarious, the reason cannot\npossibly be that from time to time some audacious spirit has impiously\nachieved the impossible by breaking through the natural order ; it\nmust be in the peculiarities of the natural order itself. Or, to sum up\nin a single phrase a discussion which would long have become needless\nbut for the persistence of attempts to dispose of an inconvenient\ninvestigation of facts by logical quibbles about words, if ' supernature '\nis to be retained, it must not be in the sense of something alien and\nhostile to ' nature,' but strictly as meaning a higher department or\naspect of nature itself.\n(2) We must suppose a certain continuity of psychological con\nstitution in the human spirit throughout every phase of its existence.\nThis does not imply that death may not be a great event, involving a\n\fxxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 59\ngreat gain (or loss) in the intensity and extent of consciousness and\nmemory ; it asserts only that if we are to have knowledge of a future\nlife at all, we must assume that the general characteristics of mental\nlife will persist. \"Without this there could be no proof of ' spirit-\nidentity ' ; without ' spirit-identity ' there could be no proof of a\nfuture life. Unfortunately, however, this assumption of ours would\nlead us to expect that the proof of 'spirit identity ' would be difficult.\nFor it is psychologically far more probable that the moral character\nand the feelings would traverse the shock and change of death\nunshaken, than that little bits of knowledge about terrestrial affairs\nwould persist in equal measure. Yet it is these latter that afford the\nbest tests of ' spirit-identity.'\n(3) As we must try to explain all the facts by principles already\nknown to be valid, we must account for the remarkable dissociation\nbetween this world and the next by the principle of psychological\ncontinuity. That such dissociation must exist will hardly be denied by\nany one who has realised how very rare an experience a 'ghost' is, even\nwith the most expert of ghost seers and in its most favoured haunts.\nBut it would seem that if the departed still retained their personality\nand psychical continuity, ' ghosts ' ought to be more plentiful than\nblackberries, and unhedged by that divinity which makes people so\nreluctant to make a clean breast of their ghost stories. Primd facie,\ntherefore, it requires explanation that in spite of psychic continuity so\nmuch dissociation should prevail.\nNevertheless it may, I think, be shown that the assumption of\npsychical continuity would be quite compatible with the prevalence\nof an almost complete dissociation between this world and the next.\nFor any. great event tends to dissociate us from our past, and this\nwould apply a fortiori to an event like death, which ex hypothesi\nlaunches us into a new world. A new world, moreover, would\nengross us not only by its novelty, but also by the practical need of\naccommodating ourselves to new conditions of existence. Hence the\npsychological conditions for great concern about the world we had left\nbehind us would hardly be present. This argument, moreover, could\nbe considerably strengthened by psychological observations with\nregard to the interest which is taken in the affairs of our world by\nthe aged. For it would be unlikely that an interest which had\nalready grown faint should effectively maintain itself amid the dis\ntractions of a new life.\nAnd even if the desire to communicate were felt, it could hardly be\nassumed that the knowledge and power to do so would at once be at\nthe disposal of the new-comer, who, for aught we know, might find\nthat, as upon his entry upon this scene, a period of helplessness and\ndependence analogous to infancy had to be passed through.\n\fGO F. C. S. Schiller. [part\nIt would seem probable, therefore, that to render communication\neffective, quite as systematic and sustained an effort would be needed\non the other side as is being made by the S.P.R. on this, while the\nself-regarding motives for making it would be indefinitely less potent.\nFor while each of us ought to Aaw1 a strong personal interest in deter\nmining what his prospects may be after death, no such case could be\nmade out for a retrospective interest of the departed in our world.\nAnd in their world the prevalent sentiment might esteem it better to\nleave us in our present doubt and discourage attempts to pry into the\npossibilities of communication with another world still more strongly\nand sincerely than the majority of us do now. This, indeed, will\nappear the more probable when we remember that, according to the\nprinciple of psychic continuity, the same, people will be making the\n.same sentiment in both cases. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that some\nday a fortunate coincidence of the efforts of an infinitesimal minority\non both sides should succeed in establishing spirit-identity and forcing\nupon the reluctant masses of men the scientific fact of a future life\nwhich they did not in the least desire to have so established. Even\nthen, however, we should still be very far from any definite and\ndetailed knowledge of the nature of the future life in itself, the\ndifficulties of transmitting which would increase enormously in pro\nportion as the dissociation between the two spheres of existence\nbecame greater.\nThus the general upshot of our discussion so far would be that a\nfuture life which was accessible to scientific methods of proof would\nnecessarily appear to be of a somewhat homely and humdrum character.\nBroadly speaking, our conceptions of it would rest on the assumption of\nsocial and psychic continuity, and they would tend to suppose that the\nreward and punishment of the soul consisted mainly in its continuing\nto be itself, with its true nature revealed more and more clearly to\nitself and others. Hence there would be but little room for epic flights\nof a lurid imagination, and those who hanker after the ecstasies of the\nblessed and the torments of the damned would have to go, as before,\nto the preachers and the poets. We may, however, trust these latter\nto work up a more copious material into pictures quite as edifying and\nthrilling as those of Homer, Dante and Milton.\nI have assumed hitherto, without a hint of doubt, the general\npossibility of the conception of a future life. But, after all, this also\nis an assumption, of a very vital character, and one which has been\nstrongly impugned on a priori grounds. I shall devote, therefore, my\n1 I emphasise the 'ought,' for, as a matter of empirical fact, the present number\nof those who are scientifically interested in the question to the extent of a guinea per\nannum appears to be about 1500 !\n\fxxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 61\nconcluding remarks to disposing of such philosophic attempts at an\na priori suppression of the question and to stating some of the\nphilosophic considerations which lead me to think the conception of\na future life a valid and non-contradictory one, whether or not we\ncan find empirical evidence of its actual existence. On the first point\nI may be brief : 1 should not deny that it is possible to devise meta\nphysical systems which will render the persistence of the individual\nconsciousness improbable and even impossible, and which consequently\nclose the question to all who really believe them. Personally, I\nbelieve those systems to be demonstrably wrong, but it is enough\nfor our purpose that they should be gratuitous, and that we may, at\nleast equally well, adopt metaphysical views which leave the question\nopen, or even lead us to regard a future life as a priori probable\nenough, and needing only verification a posteriori.\nHence, speaking for myself\u2014and in so personal a matter one must\nspeak for oneself if one wants to speak to the point\u2014I cannot at all\nappreciate the enormous antecedent difficulty which so many philo\nsophers seem to feel about the conception of a future life. Even its\nmast difficult implications, like, e.g., the transition from one world to\nanother, seem to become quite easy, if we start from the proper philo\nsophic basis. Let us, for instance, assume\u2014as I think we must do in\nany case\u2014the philosophic position of an idealistic experientialism.\nI use this clumsy phrase to designate the view that ' the world ' is\nprimarily ' my experience,' plus (secondarily) the supplementings of\nthat experience which its nature renders it necessary to assume, such\nas, e.g , other persons and a ' real ' material world. In that case the\nworld, in which we suppose ourselves to be, is, and always remains,\nrelative to the experience which we seek to interpret by it, and if that\nexperience were to change, so necessarily would our ' real ' world. Its\nreality was guaranteed to it, so long as it did its work and explained\nour experience ; it is abrogated so soon as it ceases to do so. Hence\nwe may conceive ourselves as passing through any number of worlds,\nseparated from each other by (partial) discontinuities in our experi\nence, each of which would be perfectly real while it lasted, and yet\nwould have to be declared unreal from a higher and clearer point\nof view.\nNor would this conception remain an empty form, which we could\nnot find anything in our experience to illustrate. I venture to affirm\nthat we are all of us perfectly familiar with what it feels like to pass\nfrom one world into another. When we fall asleep and dream, we pass\ninto a new world, the space, time, persons, and laws of which, tlwugh\nthey persist in principle, have no very obvious connection with the\ncorresponding characteristics of our waking life. It is true that the\nreality of each dream-world is very precarious : it is dissolved by every\n\f62 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\nclumsy interruption from a more ' real ' world, in the ex post facto\njudgment of which the dream-world is fleeting, chaotic, and un\nmanageable. Hence the consensus of common sense declares dream\nexperiences to be unreal\u2014though, it may be noted, it has taken men\na long time to arrive at this conclusion and to disabuse themselves\nof the notion that after all there must be a literally veridical and\ninspired meaning in all their experiences. What has not been realised\nwith equal clearness\u2014probably because the observation seemed to\nhave no direct practical bearing\u2014is that the existence of unreal\nworlds of dream-experience casts an indelible slur on the claim of\nour present waking life to absolute reality. What has happened once\nmay happen again, and when we wake to another world our terrestrial\nlife may appear as grotesque a parody, as misleading a distortion, of\ntrue reality as the most preposterous of dreams.\nNow this, which may be regarded as an awakening of the soul from\nthe point of view of the subject of the experience, is at the same time\nthe dissolution of his dream-world and life. That is, from the point\nof view of the beings that interacted with him in that world and life\u2014\nsupposing, of course, that his ' unreal ' experience was, as even dreams\nare, veridical to some extent\u2014it is his withdrawal, his death. Hence\nthe \" paradoxes about death \" which I have already had the honour of\npropounding to the members of the S.P.R.,1 and to which I am now\ntrying to supply a sort of commentary. \" No man ever yet perished\nwithout annihilating also the world in which he lived,\" i.e., the world of\nhis experience, or as we may perhaps say with still more accuracy, the\nobjective world, in so far as it was assumed to explain his experience.\nMoreover \" no man ever yet saw another die, but if he had he\nwould have witnessed his own annihilation \" : inasmuch as he could\nnever see the other's self and so a fortiori could not observe its\ndestruction ; what he saw was the ' death ' of a ' body ' which was\nmerely a phenomenon in his own world of experience. But if,\nper impossibUe, he could have witnessed the destruction of the\nsubject of a world of experience, his own destruction, as a phe\nnomenon in such a world, would have been included in the\ncatastrophe. Thus both these paradoxes are designed to bring\nout the essential and incurable philosophical ambiguity of ' death.' -\nDeath is not the same thing for him who experiences and for him who\nwitnesses it. It forms the limiting case which involves the breakdown\nof the great social convention, whereby we postulate (for practical\npurposes) a common world which is experienced by us all.3 Even\ni In the S.P.R.

At death it breaks\ndown altogether, and the long suppressed divergence between the\nworld of 'my ' experience and the 'objective' world, which is nobody's\nexperience but is supposed to account for everybody's, dominates the\nsituation.\nWhen a man dies his relation to the common world apparently\nceases,1 but for what reason we cannot say. It may be that he has\nceased to be ; it may also be that he has ceased to interact with us\u2014-\nuntil we also have followed his example. Similarly when we witness\na death, all that we can safely and scientifically say is that a peculiar\nfeature in our experience which impelled us to assume a self-conscious\nspirit, analogous to our own, in order to account for the behaviour of\nthe complex of phenomena we called the body of our fellow man, has\nundergone a change such that the behaviour of his ' body ' no longer\nwarrants the inference of the presence of his ' spirit.' Again, the\nreason may be that the spirit is destroyed, or that it has ceased to\nanimate the ' body.' Thus it would seem as though all that could be\naffirmed for certain about death was that it was a disruption of the\ncommon world in which spirits acted together ; what else or what\nmore it was would remain in doubt\u2014the spirit may have perished or\nit may have 'passed away.'\nThus, so far as philosophy can determine, it would seem as if the\nchances of destruction and survival were exactly equal and that we\nwere doomed to doubt for ever. Nevertheless, considerations may\nbe adduced which must add decisively to the weight of the latter\nalternative. For it should be noted that the two alternatives are\nnot equally well situated with respect to empirical evidence. No\nconceivable empirical evidence can suffice to establish the destruction\nof the soul at death, because none can even be relevant to the issue.\nFor it can only concern appearances in the common world of the\nsuTvivors, it can only prove that the rupture of connection with it\nat death is utter and entire. But that is not enough. A scientific\nproof, therefore, of the annihilation of the soul is rigorously im\npossible. On the other hand, there is no such intrinsic impossibility\nabout a scientific proof of the persistence of consciousness through\ndeath ; there is, in fact, no particular difficulty about conceiving\nempirical evidence sufficient to establish this doctrine with as high a\ndegree of certainty as we have for any of our beliefs as to matters of\nfact. The whole difficulty consists in getting the evidence. If we had\n1 \" To die is to cut off our connection with our friends ; but do they cut us, or we\nthem, or both, or neither?\"\u2014Ibid., p. 205.\n\f64 F. C. 8. Schiller. [pakt\nsucceeded, all we should need to do would be to modify our original\nassumption that death meant. an absolute rupture of relations, an utter\ndissolution of the common world. We should have to say instead, that\ndeath altered the mode of communication of spirit with spirit, render\ning it different and difficult without interrupting it altogether. But,\nproperly interpreted and manipulated, the common world would\npersist through death. What exactly would be the nature of the\ncommon world, thus extended to include a life after death, philosophy\ncould not, of course, forecast ; that would remain a question for\npositive research to determine.\nHence it is manifest that I have reached a point at which the\nphilosopher must modestly stand aside ; he can reassure the psychical\nresearcher that no a priori impossibilities block his way and that no\nauthentic fact can be too anomalous to be explained ; he can clear his\neyes of the prejudices which obstruct a clear vision of the goal, but its\nactual achievement must be the reward of the courage and endurance\nof the empirical researcher who fights his way to it step by step through\nthickets of complex and perplexing fact, and barbed-wire entangle\nments of hostile human prejudice.\n\fxxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 65\nSUPPLEMENT.\nA STUDY IN SPIRITISTIC HALLUCINATIONS.\nBy Professor Harlow Gale.\nDr. E. S. was a physician in St. Paul, Minn, with a special reputation\nfor success in diphtheria, a graduate in 1872 of Trinity College, Hartford,\nand of Rush Medical College, Chicago ; an unusually vigorous, decisive, and\nintelligent man. He was a disbeliever in religion and somewhat offensively\nso. He became associated with people below his own intellectual and social\ngrade, but not to the vicious extent which he was subsequently fond of\nexaggerating. When thus about 45 years of age, with grey hair and beard,\nand still a bachelor, he experienced in 1894 a sudden and dramatic conversion\nto \"Christian Spiritualism.\" Ho then gave up all practice and interest in\nhis profession and in the real estate business to which he had chiefly given\nhis time for several years, and devoted himself with intense single-\nmindedness and enthusiasm solely to the propagation of this faith. With a\nsmall independent income, he did not make it a money business nor himself\na professional, but in shabby clothes and with the barest necessities of life\nhe gathered a little group of converts about him. His time was occupied in\nvisiting these friends, studying his Bible and reading, and holding meetings\nthree times a week in his room in a business block.\nIn about two years he came into communication1 with Dr. Hodgson, to\nwhom he described himself and his work in the following characteristic\nletter :\u2014\n329|, Jackson Street, St. Paul, Minn., May 7th, 1896.\n(Dr.) (I presume you do not care for title) Richard Hodgson,\n5, Boylston Place, Boston, Mass.\nMy dear Doctor :\u2014Your esteemed favour of the 5th inst. duly received.\nIn reply will try to be brief. In the first place I wish to avoid all unnecessary\nnotoriety. It will be impossible to condense more than two years' extensive\nexperiences, and the accounts of hundreds of meetings, into a single letter.\nSuffice it to say I am a regular physician, graduated in 1876, at Rush\n1 This 6rst communication was a postal card as follows :\u2014\n329J, Jackson-street, St. Paul., Minn., April 30th, 1896.\nMy dear Sir,\u2014You, if still interested in your great work for your Society, and care\nfor them, will\u2014D.V.\u2014receive some interesting communications, upon my assurance\nof such being welcome from me, and of more definite knowledge of your address.\nYoure, Dr. E. S.\n\f66 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.\nMedical College i all1 a graduate of an Eastern Institution ; am now forty\nodd years of age ; brought up a Christian, but from certain disbeliefs and\nteachings of the so-called churches, I became, if not an infidel\u2014I think,\nwhile by no means an atheist, I was an infidel in belief, and certainly in\npractice and life\u2014but heard voices onco and a while, and saw clairvoyantly,\nbut did not understand these manifestations, [nor] try to bother with them,\nand while they lasted\u2014\" annoyed me\" as I used to think\u2014I fancied I was\non the verge of insanity : finally I attended a spiritualist meeting with much\ncowardice and shamefacedness, saw what they called, and what I now know\nwere materialisations, and could get when alone table rappings, table-\ntippings, and see clairvoyantly. But the table rappings and table-tippings\ndid not continue long. I finally met a business-man, who was a friend, and\nhe reluctantly told me he had seen Our Saviour many times, and that he saw\nand communicated with his late wife by asking God, Our Father, in the\nname of Jesus Christ, if he might be permitted to do so. His late wife was\na devout Christian. I shook hands with him and said I would try it that\nnight. I wanted to see my mother whose body had been buried many years\nbefore. I prayed The Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, if it was in\naccordance with His Will, not to her injury, peace or discomfort, and for my\ngood, that I might see my mother. I was all alone in my then bed-room,\ndoors locked. I saw her immediately, fully recognised her and was very\nthankful for the vision. Then I asked God in Christ Jesus' name to let me\nknow the truth as He willed, notwithstanding my former infidelity, so-called\nscience, lies of priests, preachers, or myself, or any other sources of errors.\nI began to see more clairvoyantly ; in daylight, and to write automatically,\nand these matters were often (or rather never found not to be true) proven\ntrue, with reference to past events or future events. Never once untrue ;\noften true. I began holding private meetings with my clairvoyant friend,\nwho had for over twenty years, at different times, seen Jesus Christ. At\nfirst we did not see Him ; but our own friends, and many of the departed\nmembers of our families came, and gradually brought, introduced, and made\nus acquainted with persons of hundreds, nay, thousands of years previously\nexistent in the flesh. They talked, my friend could hear and distinguish\ntheir different voices, etc. Finally the Master came, and has come very\noften to our meetings now for over six months. He has cured one man who\ntells me he has been \"doctored\" for over ten years for progressive loco\nmotor-ataxia, and by many physicians. I have taken the Master by His\nsubstantial Spiritual Hand, hear Him talk to me often, and hear many others.\nNow the Master has now been seen by twelve different people ; some have\nseen Him many times. We are informed comparatively few will see Him\nbefore He comes at the beginning of the reign of a thousand years, which\ncoming, we believe and have been informed, would be a spiritual coming, at\nleast, to the hearts and minds of human beings. We use no curtain. The\nMaster forbids it. We gather to worship Him, have seen Him accompanied\nby the Blessed Virgin, Mary Magdalene, Martha, Lazarus, all the Apostles\nand many, many others. Several times by angels (who never were in the\nflesh), His messengers. The man whom he cured was cured instantly,\nnothing was said by the Master about curing him. When the man went\naway from the meeting he could walk as well as ever, and had no pain.\n\fPart xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 67\nFour besides himself were at the meeting ; the cured man and myself only\nsaw the Master. The Master spoke briefly to me ; some timo to this man,\nwho said he heard Him, saw Him, and felt Him, and His hands. I saw and\nheard Him. The four present (besides the sick man) felt the sick man,\nwho while mentally happy, was wet and cold. A Dr. Dunlap has seen The\nMaster and others, \u2014Abraham Lincoln one of them\u2014at our meetings. He\nonly saw the Master once, and briefly. Some of us have seen the Master\nvery many times, and for\u2014sometimes\u2014not only half-an-hour, but even an\nhour, or more, at the time. One Jewish gentleman has seen him when alone,\nonce in a town-place of business\u2014 in Minn., recently while in New Haven,\nConn., and yesterday while with me. I and two others have seen the\nMaster in the clouds of Heaven (seemingly to me, very near me) ; and not\nto me for a few minutes, but for a long while, He followed me. It was a\nglorious sight. He has unlocked doors for me. He reveals himself not to\nall whom I wish. My wishes seem to have no control over who may see\nHim, or what shall occur, or whom He may bring with Him. Many self-\nrighteous, of course, call me insane. I rejoice, remembering His words, but\nam sorry for their ignorance. Subliminal consciousness, etc., and such\ntheories I am fully aware of. I can only say they do not work with me, or\nany one else so far as I can judge, at our meetings. Now I have only given\nyou a very briof outline of what would require volumes to tell, in order, and\nwith details. Perfect sequence of occurrences has not been followed. Tried\nto get man to write out an account of his sickness, and cure ; but cannot\nprevail upon him so far. He will tell those who do not approach him \"with\na jostling air \" generally. He is more than ordinarily intelligent. Was\nnot what is called \"a religious man\" previous to my talking to him about\nChristian Spiritualism. I feel the spirits, have heard them sing wonderful\nmusic\u2014two electric lights burning at the time, \u2014had them take hold of me\nforcibly indeed ; this and singing when alone ; not expecting anything of the\nkind. Have seen the Dear Lord and heard Him speak, while He manifested\nHimself both as the Saviour, The Infant Saviour, The Father and The Holy\nSpirit. As the Saviour He comes in a brown robe, as The Father in a\nwonderful blue robe, as The Holy Spirit in still more wonderful and\ndazzling white robe. Often in all ways, with a golden crown upon, or high\nin the air above His head. I will enclose a card which explains itself. He\noften says ' ' The time of my coming to the whole world is near at hand. \" \"To\ndo what we can to prepare the world for His coming.\" After speaking to mo\nI generally ask Him to give some mark of approval or disapproval to what I\nsay He has just said to me. He generally approves by gently bowing His\nHead, or that and moving the hands. Once He added to another person\nsomething additional. Excuse haste. \u2014 Yours, etc., \u2122 ci\n1 Two long letters of ten foolscap pages together were written to Mr. Hodgson on\ntwo successive days in August 1896, though Dr. S. apologised for his haste and\nhaving been too busy to write before. In these he described more in detail the\nmaterialisations of Christ to him, specially His clasping him tightly about the neck,\nhis holding St. John upon his breast as the Master had done at the last supper, and\nenumerated other personages visible to him and some of his friends as Dante, Beatrice,\nHypatia, Julius Ciesar, Pontius Pilate, Lincoln, Hancock, Garfield, Admiral Poote,\nWashington, Longfellow, etc. Each letter ended in an appeal for co-operative study\nF 2\n\f68 Professor Harlow Oale.

The following notes of a seance will give a fair sample of his\nmethods and results. Though he usually held his meetings at his own room,\nhe occasionally did at the homes of his friends, and this one was held at the\nhouse of Mrs. F. B., who had lately become a professional Clairvoyant and\nHealing Medium.\n\" 633, Cedar-street, St. Paul, Sunday evening, June 7th, 1896.\n\"Thirteen persons present, including Mrs. Gale and myself. A covered\nlamp gave light enough for one to distinguish men from women in the circle,\nbut not features. Dr. S. sat in an arm-chair about four feet from the ends\nof the circle in front of a pair of brown portieres, covering a double door.\nHe did not at any time appear to be in a trance condition, sat upright with\nhis hands on the arms of the chair, and his outline at least was visible to us\nduring the entire meeting. He offered prayer and there was frequent\nsinging interspersed during the evening. Several times he urged the sitters\nwho saw anything at all to speak of it, and he occasionally asked different\npersons if they did not see this or that. After some waiting and silence Dr.\nS. said, 'The Master is here on either side.' Mrs. B. said, ' I see Him in a\nbrown robe, He is blessing us.' Dr. S. : Tm so glad you said that, for I\nfelt He was blessing us.' Then Dr. S. gave a disconnected religious talk\nwhich he said the Master gave through him. He then announced General\nGrant as there for Capt. S., but Capt. S. did not see him, though he had\nseen him living. The General then purported to talk through Dr. S.,\nreferrini; to the ' Little Vedas.' Mrs. B. said she saw him in his uniform\nwith bright buttons, and added that Henry Ward Beecher was there by Dr.\nS's. side and with a book in his hand. But Dr. S. said, ' Yes, but I am not\nthrough with General Grant yet.' Beecher, however, also gave a talk about\nthe Virgin Mary, etc., in a disjointed way, quite unlike his natural flowing\neloquence. Dr. S. said, ' What is back of me on the curtain ? ' Mrs. B.\n'Across,' and through suggestions from Dr. S. allowed it was white and\nabout two feet high. Asked if there wasn't something at the foot of it, Mrs.\nB. piped up, ' Mary Magdalene.' Discussion between them about the hair,\nwhich had 'tawny lights in dark brown' to Dr. S., but to Mrs. B. was\n' dark brown and shiny all around.'\n\"Dr. S. saw a bunch of flowers behind Dr. D. and said they were coming\nnearer him, whereat Mrs. B. saw a whole bushel full of flowers on the floor\nin front of Dr. S. Mrs. W., next to the place where the flowers were\ndescribed, said she smelled them ; Mrs. B. then also did and called them\n\u2022 white roses.' One other lady thought that possibly she smelled them, but\nDr. S. did not and no one else.\n\"The light was now nearly all put out, though patches of light came\nthrough the blinds on to the wall and curtain back of Dr. S., and other\nstreaks under and through the cracks in the door behind him. Dr. S. then\nsaw a high back chair in the corner of the room by Dr. D. and with peacock\nfeathers about it. Mrs. B. then described an Indian man, large and massive,\nwith pompous look, and called him Pocahontas. Dr. S. asked if he wanted\nto talk and Mrs. B. said, ' Yes, he nods with his head.' This she usually\nsaid for the advent or departure of each figure. The Indian then made\n\f70 Professor Harlow Gale. .[Supplement.\nthrough Dr. S. a long tirade against FitzIIugh Lee, (as they finally made\nout with the help of Capt. S.) for murdering an Indian and fleeing to Cuba.\nCapt. S. then suggested that the real Pocahontas was a girl, and a young\nman sitter sustained this fact. Dr. S. came to the rescue of Mrs. B. by\nsaying he 'got it as a man,' etc. Much exhaustion came upon Dr. S. after\nthis Pocahontas epfsode, which had lasted some time, and he asked Mrs. B.\nto describe St. Peter, who was there. So Mrs. B. said he had ' white hair,\nbrown beard, shaggy eyebrows, somewhat bald, and high forehead ' ; Dr. S.\nexplaining the brown beard through his growing younger in the spirit\nworld ! He made a speech through Dr. S. in which he promised to appear\nto us all in our homes, especially to Capt. and Mrs. S. An Indian girl, 'Red\nClover,' was then announced, daughter of 'White Feather' and other\npedigree. ' Dear Red Clover ' was a great favourite, and on Dr. S's suggestion\nshook hands with Mrs. W., so that Mrs. W. exclaimed, 'Why, I believe I\nalmost see her.' She also made a speech through Dr. S., who thanked her\nfor having cured a sick woman lately through him. Dr. S. saw a lily over\nbetween Dr. D. and Mrs. Gale. Dr. D. had a niece named Lily, who was\nsick ; but Dr. S. insisted this belonged to Mrs. G. Mrs. B. also saw it ' as\ntall as Mrs. G.' Then followed much discussion as to the symbolical mean\ning of this lily. It was decided that it was a message from some one,\nperhaps Mrs. G.'s mother. But, after much fishing about and finding from\nDr. D.'s direct question that Mrs. G.'s mother was not in the spirit world,\nMrs. B. echoed Dr. S.'s suggestion .of its being from an aunt (which was\npossible). Then with relief Dr. S. laughed and said he saw a turnip with\nthe lily. Mrs. B. allowed she saw something 'round, long, and red on top.'\nThen followed a long discussion in which the lily and turnip were finally\ninterpreted to mean that there was a difference of religious opinion between\nMrs. G. and the departed aunt, in which Mrs. G. must get rid of some\nUnitarian tendencies. (It came out in some later conversations that this\nassociation of Unitarianism with Mrs. G. had been gained through a\nnewspaper notice of the singing of my cousin, Miss Gale, in the Unitarian\nChurch in St. Paul.) Dr. S. then asked Mrs. G. if she was not con\nnected with Universalists or Unitarians, but was disappointed to find her\na heathen.\n\"The Master was again announced, Dr. S. explaining that he sometimes\nsees the figures behind him, 'through the back of his head.' He explained\nthe Pocahontas mistake by her name being confused with the real one of\nPowhatan. He instanced another mistake which once occurred when a Mr.\nTaylor's father was given as dead, but when found living was given as\n' spiritually dead,' adding 'S. could not help it\u2014it upset S.'\n\" Dr. S. laughed again in apparent relief and said he saw a cow and a lot\nof calves there, but no explanations were offered. Coming back to Mrs. G.,\nDr. S. told her that if she ' only got rid of some little things and in fact of\nsome big things, and kept at it, she would be able to see and develop.'\nThen followed a rambling talk about a Saracen, ' Pinoalto, ' with some\nprophecy. Finally Dr. S. asked Mrs. B. if she saw something on his head,\nand she saw a wreath of flowers. The meaning of this was not enlarged\nupon. The meeting broke up and ended in a general conversation. Capt.\nS. asked Dr. S. if he should pay Mrs. B. anything and he replied, 'Just as\n\fPart xxxvi] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 71\nyou please. It is not necessary, but, if you feel like it, it will help her\nout.' Whereat Capt. S. paid her one dollar, but no one else seemed to\ngive anything.\"\nDuring the evening, as always in his conversations, Dr. S. made frequent\nreference to his own disinterestedness, aversion to notoriety or even publicity,\nand showed a naive pride in his position as a non-professional medium of\nsuch revelations to his grateful friends.\nAside from the alleged clairvoyant perceptions of sight, hearing, touch,\nand smell, described by Dr. S. and Mrs. B., the only other persons\nconfessing any were the case of flower-odour by Mrs. W. and possibly another\nlady, the doubtful touch of a hand by Mrs. W. and a confession from Dr. D.\n\u2014 extorted after repeated urgent suggestions by Dr. S. \u2014that he saw a light\non the curtain which might possibly be a head. Mrs. Gale and I saw nothing\nexcept the streaks and patches of light which came through the blinds and\ncracks, and the changing coloured patches of the retina's own light projected\non the wall or curtain. These latter we could of course see just as well with\nthe eyes closed. The alleged perceptions then were not objective as in the\nordinary materialisation seance, where every one present can see something\nin common, however much the objective sense perception may be variously\nenlarged by illusions.\nIn an interview three days after this meeting Dr. S. explained that in his\nexperience so far the figures had maintained about the same degree of reality,\ni.e. \"etherialisation,\" and only \"materialisation\" when seized by the hand.\nHe considered the former the higher manifestation, though that began with\nhim, and yet he desired somewhat, \u2014and his followers still more\u2014 the latter\nform. To my queries, he had not made direct experiments of seeing the\nfigures with the eyes closed, but believed he could and did, and described\nagain seeing behind him \"through the back of his head.'' About darkness,\nit only makes the colours brighter, otherwise he could see as well in good\nlight, which they sometimes had in their meetings. Walking with me in\nbright daylight through the crowded business streets he would describe,\nin pauses between his greetings to his many acquaintances, the figures in the\nair before and behind us and which were accompanying him. In all these\ncommunications from the spirits Dr. S. showed great earnestness and\nsincerity, in spite of somo levity and a good deal of common-placeness quite\nbelow the normal level of his intelligence and conversation.\n\"In the second meeting at which we were present on a Monday evening\nin June, 1896, in Dr. S.'s own room, there was more seriousness. Here Dr.\nS. sat nearer in our small circle of only eight persons and with a background\nof a large black cloth on the wall behind him. Though he turned off the\nelectric light in his room, it was at no time completely dark, for various\nstreaks and patches of light came through the blinds and transom. After\nthe Master, as usual, appeared ' a little Italian girl playing a harp,' a\nJewish girl for a Mr. Lazarus, Zacchieus for quite a stay, and then the Table\nof the Lord's Supper was described by Dr. S. as before us and administered\nspiritually, Mrs. B. indicating the position of the Master in his service\naround the circle. Then 'Sophie,' Mr. A.'s wife, was announced, accom\npanied by a historical Minnesota Indian squaw, 'Old Betz,' who brought\nfrogs' legs to Mr. A. as she had formerly done in real life. A dove\n\f72 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.\nalso brought herbs in an envelope to Mr. A. from his wife. Mr. A. was\ngreatly moved and welcomed her with great emotion, said she was with him\n'every hour of the day and half of the night.' He kept asking Dr. S.\nif she did not say something more, and Dr. S. described her as looking like\na beautiful young girl of fifteen, at which age Mr. A. had a photograph of\nher. Though Mr. A. did not see her, he said he felt her all down his arm\nand knew that she was there. Then Mrs. B. described, as standing behind\nme, a tall, thin-faced, black-coated man, who, with a note-book, was taking a\nrecord of the meeting. He could not reveal his identity till I became a\nbeliever, which would surely happen if I kept searching and came to know\nthe truth.\n\"In this circle Mr. A. was the only one who saw anything outside of Dr.\nS. and Mrs. B. For though Mr. A. did not see his wife, he said he saw two-\nfigures described near Mr. Lazarus, the figure behind me, some flowers, and\nthe ' Master as a child ' back of Dr. S. At the beginning of the meeting,\nhowever, Dr. S. was disappointed that Mr. A. did not see and moved his\nseat to the middle of the circle. Dr. S. made great efforts in vain with Mr.\nLazarus, who had formerly confessed to having seen something, and once\nhad him come up and hold his (Dr. S.'s) hands. In addition to the stray\nlights entering the room and the retina's projected light I could also see\nafter long fixation a light boundary contrast about Dr. S.'s head. On my\ndescribing this in response to Dr. S.'s frequent questioning of each of us,\nthey took this as a great confession and were enthusiastic for my develop\nment, which Mrs. B. thought might possibly come in a year, or even in six\nmonths, though her own had required nine years. Dr. S.'s last words to\nus were characteristic of much talk during the evening as always, \u2014'Don't\nthink S. a saint\u2014I wish he were one.' \"\nOn again joining the circle ten months later, in April, 1897, I found\nmuch the same group of devoted friends and enthusiastic disciples in various\ngrades of \" development.\" The aged Dr. D. saw a great deal, and though\n\"Sophie \" did not come to Mr. A. he groaned in joy and said the meetings\nwere getting better and better. Methuselah appeared opportunely for Dr.\nS. to ask if he really lived to be 969 years old, and on his nodding assent Dr.\nS. explained, with the confidence of authority, how some St. Paul clergymen\nhad tried to bring his age within our historical limits by a new explanation\nof the ancient Hebrew system of reckoning time. A beautiful and\nintellectual Babylonian female figure was described by Dr. S. near me, and I\nwas told to rise, wipe my hand, and she would take it. Dr. S. and Mrs. B.\nsaid she did, and my negative confession did not prevent their talking much\nabout it. More theological metaphysics had grown up during the past year,\n\"the infant word \" e.g. being quite a puzzle to the newer disciples. On my\nstudent companion mildly suggesting that perhaps imagination had something\nto do with the appearances, Dr. S., was warmly indignant, gave him a long\ntalk, seized his head violently with both hands and asked if that was\nimagination, for so they came to him.\nDuring these meetings there was never any appearance of effort at, or\nopportunity for, deception ; but in December, 1890, an interesting opportunity\noccurred to test Dr. S.'s faith and honesty. During a two-and-a-half hours'\n\fHart xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 73\ninterview I chanced to show him some alleged spirit photographs of Mumler,\nBoston, which I had just got from one of the best known photographers in\nSt. Paul, and though he had never seen any before he did not show much\ninterest in them. But he immediately suggested that I wrap up some photo\ngraphic plates in black paper, enclose them in a box, seal it securely, and the\nMaster had given him to understand that if left with him eight hours he\ncould perhaps get a photograph of the Master. So the next day when alone\nin a dark room of my laboratory, I wrapped two 4 by 5 plates in three layers\nof black paper and two layers of black cloth, tied them with a string and\nsealed the knots, packed these in a plate box, sealed its four corners, put\nthis in the outside cover, sealed a string around the whole, took drawings of\nall these strings and seals, and took this package to him in the forenoon.\nI offered to come later in the day and develop the plates after the eight hour\nlimit, but he now wanted to keep them over night. So two days later we\nmet, went to the dark room of Zimmerman Bros., well known dealers in\nphotograph materials, and developed the plates with hydrochinon. He had\nexpressed much anxiety that the box should not go into any other person's\nhands and that I, with him alone present, should develop the plates.\nNothing came upon the first plate with ten minutes' development, though we\nexamined it frequently, and nothing on the second plate after fifteen minutes'\ndevelopment. Dr. S., standing by, asked many questions and seemed in\nignorance of the process. He was very much disappointed, and said that the\nMaster told him just then\u2014as he stood iu a listening attitude\u2014that we must\ntry it again and keep at it, for \"according to your faith shall it be unto you. \"\nFinally after the Hypo bath Dr. S. spied something on the first plate, an\nirregular patch about an inch in diameter, and said it was a face. The longer\nhe looked at it, the more certain he became, till after a few moments he pointed\nout\u2014on my asking\u2014the nose, chin, beard, and long hair, as he had described\nthem. On taking the plate out into the cellar for better light he called an\nelectric light repairer, who, on the Doctor's suggestion, admitted it was a\nface. But on Mr. Zimmerman being appealed to, he said there was nothing, it\nlooked like a plate which had not been exposed. And on the Doctor's calling\nhis attention to this face in the corner, he wiped the plate on the back side\nand the \"face\" disappeared with the dirt and water. Somewhat chagrined\nat this, the Doctor hurriedly left, while I washed the plates, dried them, and\nstill could find nothing on them. On taking all the wrappings with me and\ncarefully examining them, as I had of course not been able to do when I\nopened the boxes and wrappings in his presence, I am very sure he had\nmade no attempt to open the box when in his possession.\nA month later 1 told him I was ready for another trial, as he had proposed.\nBut his faith had somewhat weakened, for though he still expects some time\nto get these material proofs, he considered it for the present premature and\na waste of time. I found later from Mr. Zimmerman that Dr. S. had\nvisited him after our failure, and his weakening of faith was evidently due\npartly at least to Mr. Zimmerman's discouragement. However, toward the\nend of our interview he wanted me to bring some plates as before and sit\n\u25a0with them in my lap during a meeting, so as not to allow them out of my\npossession. On my suggesting a camera as necessary, he thought that\nwould almost surely be successful. But as the main point of testing any\n\f74 Professor Harlow Gale.

He asserted\nthat a door had been unlocked for him, showed me the door and explained\nthe conditions, but thoy were too uncertain to amount to anything. His few\nalleged cases of the communication of past knowledge from the spirits were\nnot even reputable cases for telepathy. And though his prophecies were a\ngreat source of pride to himself, they seemed to reveal nothing more than\ncould easily be accounted for by chance and the reproduction of his\nknowledge as an oinuivorous reader of newspapers. (One day before his\ndeparture I found him tearing up a great quantity of newspaper clippings\nwhich he had collected in a large ledger.) The following prophecy printed\nin the St. Paul DUpntch, dated and published August 12th, 1895, was\ncharacteristic of his religious life and dealt with current newspaper topics.\n\" THE BRIGHT FUTURE.\n\" Which the Spirits Predict for the Favored North-West.\n\" Great Crops in Store.\n\"for the next three years there will be bountiful harvests to be\ngarnered in these states\u2014twin cities will be united in the\nname of st. paul\u2014canals now projected will be actual facts,\nand the great metropolis will teem with the commerce of a\nWORLD.\n\" As long ago as last February the Dispatch printed a crop prediction,\nfurnished \"by spirits\" through the medium of a favored individual, which\nhas been verified with wonderful accuracy of detail.

These prophecies given in February, 1895,\nrelated to the great and bountiful crops, which would be given, and given to\nthe people of the Northwest by the Master this present year.\n\"Several persons can testify that very early in the season the February\nprophecies were made known to them.\n\"There have lately been given more prophecies of still greater events\nand importance to the people, particularly of the Northwest.

These prophecies, no\none, not disposed to believe, need believe. The persons to whom they have\nbeen given do believe, and are thoroughly convinced that events related*\ntherein to come, will come, for they have proven these Christian spirits\nmany times, and in many matters of even far greater importance than those\n\fPartxxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 75\nrelating to material prosperity ; that is, the Divine Government of the entire\nuniverse by God, our Heavenly Father, by the Divine Son, Jesus Christ,\nOur Redeemer, the Master, and through the Master, the Holy Ghost, the\nSpirit of Truth, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit of God, working on all good\nspirits, whether in the spirit world, or still in the flesh. The prophecies\nmade Aug. 7, 1895, are briefly as follows :\n\"First\u2014That the present crops in the three states of Minnesota, North\nand South Dakota, all these prophecies are primarily related to the states\nmentioned, are greater than any estimates yet made, and supposed to be\nreliable by the general public. The crops for the next four years following\nwill be bountiful in these same three states, while crops in certain other\nparts of the world during part of the same period will be less than the\naverage crops during ordinary years, excepting Illinois and Indiana, during\nthe next two years will bear the average crops. In other Northwestern\nregions the crops will be also fair, but not so abundant as in these three\nstates.\n\"Thirdly \u2014That a great waterway will be made within the next ten\nyears, and great ocean ships will land where Minneapolis now is.\n\" Fourthly\u2014The next great change will be that the Twin Cities will\nbecome one great city, and that (greatly enlarged), the united cities will be\ncalled St. Paul, which will extend many more miles farther eastward and a\ngreat many more miles westward ; that a great many towns will spring up\nalong the waterway from the lakes to the City of St. Paul.\n\" Fifthly\u2014Other great events will be the great manufactories for manu\nfacturing and producing by electrical processes, iron and steel, which will\ndirectly employ large numbers of men, and especially benefit millions of\npeople in the states of Minnesota, North and South Dakota. That the\nState of Minnesota will increase in population very many hundreds of\nthousands ; and that most of the now waste lands will be cultivated ; that\nMinnesota will become one of the favored fruit growing sections, and that\nthe climate during the winter will become much warmer ; that great and large\nboats will float in the Mississippi river, to what is now called Minneapolis,\nfrom the South and from the Atlantic, through the Great Lakes to the then\nCity of St. Paul ; that ships from the South and ships from the North will\nbe locked up and down at the then City of St. Paul and other points neces\nsary to the successful operation of this great waterway.\n\"There will be a great many large manufactories in successful operation\nin the then City of St. Paul, particularly in rolling mills, and iron and steel\nmanufacture.\n\" These prophecies are of the true Christian spirits, who come in the\nname of the Master, Jesus Christ, and in and by Him only.\n\"True Christian Spirits.\"\nOver a year after these prophecies I heard him dispute very dogmatically\nabout them with a well-known business man to whom he was formerly family\nphysician.

[Supplement.\nAfter his conversion he despised his former profession and especially the\nmedicine, against which he could hardly say enough. But he seems\ngradually to have come to heal through the alleged mediumship of spirits.\nAfter one or more cases of partial relief to deafness, his first and still his\ngreatest case occurred in the spring of 1896 and is referred to in his letter\nabove. Mr. A., having been a railway conductor for fifteen years, bocame\nafflicted with locomotor ataxia until he could only walk with difficulty by the\naid of a cane. He consulted the president of Rush Medical College, Chicago,\nwho gave him something for partial relief, but could not offer him any hope\nof cure. Having left the railway and become the proprietor of a small hotel\nin St. Paul, and with his lameness now about four years old, he attended\none of Dr. S's meetings. There he saw the Master approach him with out\nstretched hands, felt the hands on his head, heard Him say something ending\nwith \"rise and walk,\" at which he rose and walked off easily. During this\nlaying on of His hands he \" felt as if burning up,\" in which condition Dr. S.\nhad all the ten persons present touch Mr. A. Though he is now slow in his\nspeech and movements, he has had no relapse, and as I have seen him several\ntimes during the past two years and since shortly after his cure I can testify\nthat he walks without any dragging of the foot. He became an enthusiastic\nChristian as well as Spiritualist, by far the most consistent and devoted of\nDr. S.'8 followers, and has \"never ceased to thank the good Lord daily for\nthis miracle. \"\nAt meetings since this Dr. S. would occasionally describe the \"Master's\nlaying on of hands \" for some one's betterment. He said that an Indian\nspirit also had effected several cures at patients' homes. These healing*\nincreased until during his last year in St. Paul they occupied much of his\ntime. He had moved from his private room to an obscure office, and though\nprimarily for better quarters for his tri-weekly meetings, yet with his\nmedical library again set up and his plain door sign of Dr. E. S., he was in a\nbetter situation for his spirit treatment. Thus one day in January, 1898, I\nfound a Mrs. W. there, who, after her testimony as to the spirits she had\nseen, described the stomach trouble for which she had gotten relief from Dr.\nS. as from no one else, though she had travelled about considerably. By\nthis time, however, he had returned somewhat to his regular medicine, for\nin addition to the spirit treatment he also gave her a medical prescription.\nAs he impressively bade her good-bye, never expecting to see her again on\nearth, she was greatly moved and could not sufficiently express her gratitude\nto him for her bodily relief and religious awakening. Two of his later\npatients I also interviewed. Mrs. Johnson, 106, East Fairfield Avenue,\nWest St. Paul, though she came to the door on crutches, claimed that she\nhad been greatly helped by Dr. S. in her long-standing rheumatism. She too\nhad the greatest gratitude for this relief and said he had stimulated her to\nhave more will power and courage. Frau Haase, on the River Flats, had\nbeen a general invalid for seven years, especially with pains in her back.\nWithout any medicine Dr. S. had made her a new woman, and, though she\nhad some returns of pain, can now will them away herself. Similar cures\nshe now makes for her neighbours. Her gratitude to Dr. S. was unbounded,\nand she showed a painful anxiety for his safety since his departuie. Almost\nall his patients were women.\n\fPart xxxvi i A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 77\nHe had frequently spoken of his stay in St. Paul as being uncertain, said\nthat he might leave at any time, and showed many signs of unrest. Finally\nin January, 1898, I found him really packing up to leave. Mingled with his\ncustomary paradoxical and pseudo-humility talk, he gave as one of his reasons\nfor leaving that all his followers were too ignorant and he himself the only\nscholar. He seemed discouraged at the slowness of his propagandism. Also\nhe complained to me for the first time of lack of financial support. The aged\nDr. D., a retired physician, he abused roundly as \" too stingy to come \" to\nhim more, though he never demanded money from him or any one. Mr. A.\nwas the only one who had given him money at his meetings, about two or\nthree dollars all together, and, as he himself said, \" had been repaid a dozen-\nfold.\" His patients gave him money or not, spontaneously, according to\ntheir means. Some, as Mrs. J., insisted on paying him every visit ; others,\nas a working girl, Miss C., paid for the medicine, in case he added any to\nthe spirit treatment. Others, as Frau H., could and did give him nothing.\nBut he felt imposed upon by some who could afford to give, but who did not.\nThus he was \"not making his office rent,\" and in vigorously tearing up his\ngreat collection of newspaper scraps, letters, and writings, he showed his\nrighteous and violent indignation. And it seems from his business agent, a\nwell-known lawyer, that there was much justification for this feeling ; for in\ntrying to help financially some of his followers, as well as owing to depressed\nbusiness conditions, he had gotten his property so tied up and his income\ntherefrom so reduced that he had to accept whatever any one offered him.\nAnd though his habits of living were the simplest and cheapest, yet he is\ndescribed as being to some of his followers \" generous to a fault.\" He would\ntell no one but his agent where he was going, and though his friends inferred\nto the Klondike, he has been reported as in Seattle, Wash.1 His absence\nwas to be for an indefinite time and very doubtful if he ever returned.\nThus in Lohengrin mystery and with evident consciousness of a mission to\nperform, he left St. Paul in February, 1898, for some place \"where he would\nbe very busy.\"\nTo judge of the nature of Dr. S. 's own spirits, it will be of much value to\nfirst go over the testimony of his friends, as I gathered it in interviews and\nnotes at the time. Mrs. A. J. C, a widow about sixty, mother of one of the\nhighest legal officers of the state, had in June, 1896, seen Christ three times\nin Dr. S.'s presence, once in his room and twice in different houses of his\nfriends. The figure appeared in vapoury grayish outline, as if about one\nhundred yards off. It had a smooth face, hair parted in the middle, a crook\nin the hand, was always accompanied by two female figures, one being Mary\nthe Mother, the other was Dr. S.'s mother. They always appeared just\nback of Dr. S. Though the room was dark, she could see the faces of those\npresent. Dr. S. had at the outset described to Mrs. C. and her friend Mrs.\nP. how the Master would come, and she saw it substantially as he had\ndescribed, though Mrs. P. did not. The figures appeared suddenly and did\n1 Prompted by a newspaper notice of Mr. Hodgson's article on Mrs. Piper, Dr.\nS. wrote him from Chicago in September, 1898, again urging as in the above letters an\ninvestigation of his phenomena.

She saw them, however, also with her eyes closed and\nher hands held before her eyes, trying this experiment several times. She\nhad no impression that it was the Master beyond the resemblance of the\nfigure to the conventional pictures of him and Dr. S.'s word. Since these\nmeetings she has often tried in the twilight to call up voluntarily these\nfigures, but not succeeded. However, when lonely in her own room and\nlonging for her mother, she can suddenly see her in the same vapoury way,\nbut, when anxiously trying to do so, cannot see her. Dr. S. had originally\ninvited her in the hope of her seeing her husband, but this she has not\nsucceeded in doing. Messages, however, of no special purport were given by\nDr. S. as coming from the late Mr. C. Mrs. C. doubts genuine materiali\nsation, but is investigating spiritualism in accordance with a promise to\nher husband when on his death-bed. She believes that as a girl she had\nclairvoyant power, saw occasional figures all through her life and described\na persistent one which she saw constantly during the months preceding the\nbirth of one of her sons and which she believes marked the whole unusual\nappearance of this son. Since starting her investigation of spiritualism, the\nfrequency and variety of these figures have greatly increased, till now,\n(August, 1898), she has seen \"hundreds.\" She still, however, much to her\nsorrow, has never seen her late husband. She thinks Dr. S. a very pure and\nhigh-minded man, but eccentric and in danger of being unbalanced.\nMr. A., who experienced the dramatic cure of locomotor ataxia, has seen\n\" lots of figures, as many as ten about Dr. S. at once,\" and still (August,\n1898) sees his wife, mother, and the Master in his hotel ; but he thinks he\nhas seen only one real materialisation and that was once when his mother\nput her arm about him. All the others he described as more spirit-like, and\nyet opaque enough that he cannot see objects through them.\nMiss McC., about thirty years of age, in the office of a large business\nhouse, had seen Christ alone and with a friend of hers before she knew of\nDr. S. She has since then seen him at Dr. S's. two or three times and also\nwhen alone. Thus she thought that Dr. S. claimed too much in his special\nprivilege as the medium of Christ's appearance. As a consumptive she was\nhaving treatment from Mrs. B., the professional friend of Dr. S., \" to see if\nthe spirits were of any value \" for her sickness.\nCaptain E. S., real estate agent, is a spiritualist through his wife, who is\nan amateur medium. They both have been twice to Dr. S.'s meetings, but\nneither saw anything, \" although Mrs. S.'s mediumship is strong.\" A pro\nfessional medium, Mrs. H., whom they once took with them, claimed to see all\nthat Dr. S. did. With a high regard for Dr. S., Captain S., however, thinks\nhim in danger of being unbalanced by exclusive devotion to his work.\nT. B., a student friend of mine, and now a physician, visited Dr. S. one\nafternoon in June, 1896, was warmly welcomed, and entertained by a long\ntalk. As a sample, apparently, of his power, Dr. S. volunteered a descrip\ntion of B.'s grandmother, as he saw her playing the piano ; but, on learning\nthat she never saw a piano, he symbolised it as joy at B.'s getting on the\nright track. In the evening B. attended one of the regular meetings. The\nusual appearances of the Master were described, perfume suielled, Dr. D.\nsaw something, Mr. A. got excited and saw everything, Miss McC. saw\nsomething. But B. neither smelled nor saw anything, except the flickering\n\fPart xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 79\nlights on the wall which came through the transom or window. Dr. S. took\nmuch trouble and evident pride in following B. up with long letters and\ninvitations for more visits and meetings, and in encouragement for his study\nof these all-important phenomena.\nF. F. W. , a German-American lawyer, about fifty, was introduced to me\nwith much explanation at lunch one day by Dr. S., and, on walking back to\nDr. S.'s office together, he urged and insisted that Mr. W. should tell me\nwhat he had seen. But Mr. W. had to mildly protest that he himself had\nreally seen nothing as yet, but was merely developing, although Dr. S. had\ntold me that Mr. W. had seen General Grant ; but Mr. W. admitted that\nDr. S. had correctly told him about his having met General Grant in the\nsouth part of Milwaukee, soon after the war. In a subsequent talk with me\nalone, Mr. W. described the varying patches of form and colour which he\nhad seen at the meetings, and which were evidently the retina's own light.\nMr. W.'s wife, however, sees clairvoyantly, and was successful in the first\nmeeting reported above. Though Mr. W. has no confidence in professional\nmediums, he believes Dr. S. to be perfectly sincere and genuine.\nFrau H., one of his patients, a middle-aged woman, besides seeing the\nMaster at Dr. S.'s, described in detail her seeing Him in her own house.\nBut she has not seen many others of the biblical characters.\nW. B. , lawyer and business agent of Dr. S.'s, has attended three or four\nmeetings, and the first time he saw nothing. But the second time, on\nfixating with effort and extreme tension, he once or twice saw what they\ncalled the \"face transfiguration,\" once to that of General Grant, although,\nhe allowed, the whiskers were not different from Dr. S. 's. He is sure that\nonce, anyway, he recognised a transfigured face before any one else described\nor named it, though he is not sure whether he first spoke of it. The trans\nfigured face was very fleeting. Having been warned by his wife against\nbeing completely hypnotised, he did not make the same effort to see at the\nnext meeting, and then saw nothing. Mr. B. thinks the Doctor has tele\npathic powers from his own account, and believes him thoroughly honest\nand sincere.\nThere is only one witness who seems to me of no evidential worth, and\nthat is the professional, Mrs. B., who was only occasionally present at the\nmeetings, though she happened to be at the three which I attended. Her\nready and cheerful manner of echoing or anticipating all the usual round of\nfigures described by Dr. S., the ridiculous mistakes she made (as, for\nexample, in the Pocahontas matter), the business way in which she adver\ntised herself for patients and encouraged every novice to sit for the\ndevelopment of his natural mediumistic powers, the transparent super\nficiality with which she once announced her starting a Bible class at her\nhome for weekly study\u2014all these things were highly suspicious of her\ngenuineness, and quite opposed in general to the Doctor's traits. So I\ndoubt very much whether she really saw anything, and I believe she\ndeceived him. For, to my expressed objections to her in my last inter\nview with him in January, 1898, he was not concerned, and believed her\nto the end his good friend, though he included her among his ignorant\nfollowers. But Mr. A. tells me that Dr. S. warned him and others \"not\nto take too much stock in what she said.\" Mr. A. himself had become\n\f80 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.\nsuspicious of her, as having too much imagination, for he thought it was\nstrange that she always saw what he did, but that he by no means always\nsaw what she described. Another reason of distrust which he gave was\nquite characteristic of such a mental composition, viz., that Mrs. B. had\ntold him that his wife had not appeared to him for some time because\nshe had been sick, but when she did again appear, and he asked her if\nthe sickness was the reason, she denied it, and said she had been oft' on\nthe Master's business. There is a possibility, of course, that she may\nhave been in collusion with Dr. S., supposing him to have been con\nsciously deceiving.\nWhen then we come to the question of Dr. S.'s own genuineness, two\ncomponents of his character must be specially considered. First, he had\nundergone an intellectual change which so disturbed his mental equilibrium\nthat he was carried largely, if not altogether, over that vague and broad\ntransition towards the category of the insane. When a man with the\nscientific education of a physician is suddenly \"converted\" in middle life\nto the literal belief in biblical theology adopted by Dr. S. ; or when, in other\nwords, a mature mind abandons reasoning by facts and induction for the\ntheological deduction from authority and for poetical analogies, that is a\nregression to unreasonableness. And Dr. S. 's unreasoning in this sphere made\nhim dogmatic and imperious in other things. He frequently ridiculed my\ntrying to get at the \"chemical basis,\" as he expressed it, of his spirits, and\nsaid I could never see till I joined him in first believing. On my seriously\ntrying to explain my efforts to find a psychological basis for his spirits, he\nwould cut me short authoritatively, saying he knew all those things and that\nthey had nothing whatever to do with his Christian Spiritualism. And yet\nI could not find that he had seriously studied or considered any natural\nexplanation of his phenomena. His intense emotional concentration in this\nsubject so contracted his intellectual life that he had no longer any interest\nin the overwhelming mass of the world outside his narrow theological limits.\nSecondly, this intellectual concentration of attention and interest was\naccompanied by an abnormal heightening of the feeling-component in his\ncharacter. For his intense pride in his mission showed itself constantly in\nmany forms. It often became laughable under the cover of his continual\npseudo-humility talk, \u2014\"don't think S. a saint,\" \"it's no credit of S.'s,\" \"S.\nis a mere nothing.\" Though he did not proselytize to any one's annoyance,\nyet his greatest happiness was to get some one to whom he could \"talk\nspirits ; \" and any new possible convert was followed up tenaciously with\ntalks, visits, introductions and letters. He never associated himself with\nany religious or spiritualistic church or organisation, but evidently had\nmore pride and pleasure in forming and being the privileged head of his\nlittle circle of followers. When I asked him about other spiritualists and\nespecially what he thought of the materialisation phenomena, then being\ngiven at our neighbouring N. W. Spiritualistic Camp Association, he would\nonly say, \" God bless them\u2014perhaps they have something ; \" but he never\nseemed to have had there or elsewhere any experience of the usual clair\nvoyant phenomena and cabinet materialisation. He emphasised the fact\nthat he was a Christian Spiritualist, in that he was a Christian first of all\nand then by logical necessity a Spiritualist, which he feared was not the\n\fp&rt xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 8L\norder or relative importance with most Spiritualists. He explained the rare\nappearances of Christ and other biblical characters as due to the lower plane\nof the ordinary mediums, and thus by inference, the special communion of\nwhich he was the instrument was a Divine mark as surely as that of Parsifal's\nand Sir Galahad's. And yet the number of his followers who had seen\nthe Master\u2014and this was the test of his disciples\u2014only grew from twelve\nin June 1896 to about thirty at the beginning of 1897, and about fifty in\n1898, at the end of his four years' activity in this new faith in St. Paul.\nSo in this case then we find the delusion of grandeur, which is so commonly\na characteristic in the unbalanced feeling-life. The pecuniary motive of the\nprofessional was absent, and the only apparent motive was the altogether\ndisproportionate satisfaction which he got in this obscure life as the centre\nof his heterogeneous group of Christian Spiritualists.\nWith these abnormal intellectual and emotional characteristics, then, I\nthink it most probable that Dr. S.'s spirits were for the most part real to\nhim and not assumed. It seems rather probable that with his anxiety for\nsuccess and converts he may have unconsciously come to add merely verbal\ndetails or even whole descriptions to his apparently real sense perceptions.1\nBut that the Master and a large number of figures were honestly real to him,\nI believe, from his self-sacrifice for his cause, sincerity, and lack of sufficient\nmotive for complete deception, whether conscious or unconscious. But the\nonly visual objective reality corresponding to the spirits seemed to be the\nprojected lights of the retina, stray patches and streaks of light entering\nthe room, and perhaps some boundary-contrasts and after-images. For the\nhearing, touch and smell perceptions of the spirits and spiritual objects, I\nhave no evidence of any objective reality. Some of the cutaneous or\nmuscle sensations constantly present with attention and some singing in\nthe ears may have been the nucleus of the touches and voices. Whether,\nthen, these alleged clairvoyant etherialisations and materialisations should\nbe catalogued under illusions or hallucinations depends on whether there\nwere any objective perceptions and point of attachment. This objective\nelement being apparently at most so inconsiderable, these phenomena of\nDr. S.'s should more properly be classed as hallucinations or in part as\npseudo-hallucinations.2 This is probably the more justifiable from Dr.\nS.'s own statement in his letter above that before his conversion he \"heard\nvoices once in a while and saw clairvoyantly, but did not understand these\nmanifestations,\" and was annoyed by them till he fancied himself on the\nverge of insanity. With this exaggerated or even pathological tendency to\nhallucinations came the suggestion from his old German friend of seeing\nChrist. The mental changes wrought by his conversion were exactly fitted\nto develop this hallucination and the others would develop most naturally\nby association, intense attention, and hallucinatory projection.\nThis process can be traced in his followers even more clearly. The most\ninstructive witness was Mrs. C, with a hallucinatory predisposition from\ngirlhood, and who only needed the emotional loneliness of her widowhood\n1 Compare the case of the Creery Sisters: Proceedings of the S.P.R., Vol. V.,\np. 269.\n*See \"Report of the Census of Hallucinations \" in Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. X.,\np. 76.

Her\nexperiments with closed eyes show all her figures to bo no more than hallu\ncinations. Similar is the case of the hotel-keeper, Mr. A., in his loneliness\nfor his wife, and perhaps some predisposition to hallucination as shown by\nhis nervous degeneration in locomotor ataxia. With these preparations, the\nconfident assurances of Dr. S., the apparently miraculous relief of his lame\nness by suggestion, and his enthusiastic acceptance of Dr. S.'s religion, all\naided in giving a hallucinatory objectivity to his ideas and feelings ; while\nfor other followers who needed more training in attention and emotion.\nDr. S.'s method was well fitted. The long waiting and expectation in\ndarkness, the enviable descriptions of successful \"seeing,\" the frequent\nencouragement and urging for the sitters to describe anything they saw,\nthe personal interrogation whether they did not see this or that\u2014all this\naroused partial or occasional success.\nThis case of spiritistic hallucinations is of special interest, it seems to\nme, as being so comparatively simple, so free from the usual confusion of\naccompanying fraud, unconscious deception, genuine physical phenomena and\ntelepathy, automatic writing, etc. Thus it affords a clear view of the process\nof the development of spiritistic hallucinations, helping to fill an evidential\ngap in the \"Report on the Census of Hallucinations,\" where one reported case\ngave rise to the remark that \" it is possible that habitual attendance at\nspiritualistic seances may lead in some persons to the seeing of apparitions\nand hearing of voices.\" (Proceedings of the S.P.R., Vol. X., p. 176.) Mr.\nGurney, from his study of the earlier Census, had also thought that \"it\nmust be admitted as nossible that mere verbal suggestion may act similarly\n[i.e., to hypnotic collective hallucinations] on certain minds at certain times,\nwithout tho preliminary of any definite hypnotic process.\" (Phantasms of\nthe Living, 1886, Vol. II., pp. 187-8.)\nIn helping to reduce the separation between suggestion m the con\nditions of hypnosis and of normal life the case under consideration is also\nvaluable. For the late progress in the understanding and explanation of\nhypnotic phonomena has been by freeing them from the marvellous and\nabnormal, and by connecting them with the better known facts of our\nnormal mental life.\nBut it is in the help it affords in explaining some parts of the usual\nmedley of mediumistic phenomena that this case is more immediately\nvaluable. For with some basis of genuineness, the usual phenomena of\nany medium or group of spiritualists are a bewildering conglomerate, and\nyet an apparently homogeneous whole, because they are usually all ex\nplained on one hypothesis. But, more and more, in all psychological\nphenomena it is becoming necessary first to separate the phenomena into\nas many categories as possible and then seek for the explanation of each\nclass. Throughout my acquaintance with this case I have had continually\nin mind its possible application to the clearing up of such enigmas as\nthe experiences of W. Stainton Moses and the high testimony on record\nto the marvels of D. D. Home.\nThere was much in common as to characteristics and methods between\nDr. S. and Mr. Moses.

There was, however, on the whole\na more serious religious purpose and level in Dr. S.'s phenomena, and a\nmore devoted self-sacrifice to his mission, (ibid., pp. 258 and 334.) Both\nwere amateur mediums, giving their manifestations to only a small circle\nof friends, Mr. Moses being the more exclusive. And while avoiding\nnotoriety, both were willing their experiences should be used as testimony\nand aided in their publication.1 The fundamental motive of both seemed to\nbe the satisfaction of authority and leadership. The intellectual character\nof the witnesses to Mr. Moses' phenomena were higher than Dr. S.'s, but\nthere were similar emotional conditions of admiration, unsuspiciousness and\nexpectation.\nWhen one now reviews Mr. Moses' phenomena to separate any possible\nclass of hallucinations, it is of course impossible to draw any clear-cut and\ncertain lines. Unfortunately we have not a sufficiently full report of the\nmethods and conversations during the seances to judge of the amount of\nverbal suggestion. But it seems to have been quite sufficient (as in ibid., p.\n322, in Dr. Speer's Report) for the training of expectation until, after\nrepeated se'ances, the sitters knew by association what to expect from any\nname, sound, light, odour, or touch. Some of the visual phenomena seem\nundoubtedly hallucinatory. Mr. Moses tells us that the most successful\nlarge luminous appearances, as well as the most perfect musical sounds,\noccurred when he was in a state of unconscious trance (ibid., p. 268 and\n276), and thus we must usually rely directly on the testimony of the sitters.\nThe luminous haze and globes, together with their movements described by\nDr. Thompson (ibid., p. 274), seem quite possible as hallucinations, and\nthe similar ones in Dr. Speer's statement (p. 275) seem to have been held\nby a probably hallucinatory hand and drapery, even if the lights were\nobjective. Here the process of verbal suggestion is well described, when\nthe \"controlling spirit informed me that he would endeavour to place a\nlight in the medium's hand. Almost immediately a light came. 'Now I will\nshow you my hand.' A large, very bright light then came up, and inside of\nit appeared the materialised hand of the spirit. He told me that the folds\nwhich I saw around the light were drapery, and to prove it he brought the\nlight and passed the drapery over the back of my hand several times.\"\nOne more evident case of hallucination was in Mr. Moses' \"vision\"\nwhere \"Dr. and Mrs. Speer saw misty light but nothing more\" (p. 293).\nA moving column of light, seven feet high, with a large glowing mass of\nlight, the cross behind the medium's head, and the cluster of oblong lights,\n(p. 297) may have been partly, if not wholly, hallucinatory. In this se'ance,\nas in most, the description is not full enough for us to be sure that objective\nstray lights were not present as the basis of illusions. Dr. Speer is said in\nMr. Moses' account to have first seen the light, and Mrs. Speer's testimony\n1 Dr. S.'s case was thus more similar to Mr. Moses' than the case of Mr. Z.,\nreported by Professor Sidgwick in his paper on \"Disinterested Deception\" in the\nJournal S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 274 ; for Mr. Z.'s case lacked the religious and publioity\nmotives.\ng 2\n\f84 Professor Harlow Gale. isuppiement.\nto it is wanting, though she was present. Four months later Dr. Speer\nrecalls seeing \"the hand and arm.\" (p. 306.) Seven months after these\nother phenomena began, the first human figure was recorded by Mrs. Speer.\n\"We saw a form surrounded with light, standing between myself and the\nmedium.\" (p. 302.) But it is not mentioned either in Mr. Moses' or Dr.\nSpeer's notes. Again four months later Mr. Moses recorded : \"Dr. and Mrs.\nSpeer and I saw a jfigure carrying it [scent] apparently. I also saw a figure\nin the middle of the table when the lyre was sounded there.\" (p. 312.)\nBut neither Dr. nor Mrs. Speer testified to the former figure, and Mr.\nHarrison, who was present, is not included in Mr. Moses' account as seeing\nthe figure.\nDr. Speer alone then notes the beginning of numerous lights:\u2014 \"Be\ntween thirty and forty spirit lights appeared, many of them as large as\nlarge oranges. They began near the floor, then ascended, and at last by\nrequest came within our circle, so that we might have touched them.\nMany of the lights were amorphous, or rather, formless. They succeeded\neach other with great rapidity,\" (p. 313.) At the next seance he notes\nsimilar lights emerging from the aperture of the curtain of a cabinet\nwhich had been fitted up, and in which Mr. Moses sat. With such\na convenience it seems more probable that these lights were produced\nobjectively by the medium, as the lights are said to have cast reflec\ntions upon objects, and some were so large and bright as to show the\nwhole of the lintels and door posts. (p. 313.) Under those cabinet\nconditions at the following seance Mr. Harrison seems, from Dr. Speer's\nnotes, to have seen these lights. The medium having suggested going\nupstairs to the cabinet, and trying for lights, Dr. Speer notes that \" they\ncame almost immediately, of various shapes and sizes, some very large\/'\nHe gives rough drawings of their shapes and continues, \"they were all of a\npale bluish green, or rather greenish blue, tint. Many of them had a\nperfectly distinct hard outline and bright nucleus. Mr. Harrison says that\nsuch lights could by no possibility be imitated [Mr. H. was an electrician],\nand imagines that they were produced by hands holding crystals with drapery\nfalling on them.\" (p. 314.) The shapes and colours of these lights are\nthoroughly characteristic of the projections of the retina's own light. It is\nsuspicious of the trustworthiness of the medium's account that Mr.\nHarrison's imagined explanation of the light by the hand and drapery in\nDr. Speer's notes is given in Mr. Moses' account as a described fact. Again\nDr. Speer notes \"a large number of splendid lights, apparently held by\nhands, were seen in the cabinet. I myself saw an arm apparently holding\none of these lights.\" (p. 317.) But no testimony is given to these by Mrs.\nSpeer and Dr. Thompson, who were present. Another similar case two\ndays afterwards occurred at which Mr. Percival joined the family group.\nAgain, sitting with Dr. Speer alone, Mr. Moses himself records having\n\" witnessed the formation of some eight or nine very beautiful spirit lights.\nThey formed quite close to me and near my left hand, about a foot from the\nfloor, floating upwards till they reached the level of the table and became\nvisible to Dr. Speer. They were expressly made at my side, instead of, as\nusual, at my back, so that I might see them. They seemed to develop from\na very bright speck, about the size of a pea, until they attained the size of a\n\fPart xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 85\nsoda* water tumbler, and showed a soft luminosity like pale moonlight. They\nseemed to be covered with drapery and to be held by a hand. They faded\nslowly out, remaining visible about thirty or forty seconds, or perhaps a\nminute. The largest would be about eight inches long.\" (p. 319.) As Mr.\nMoses did not himself usually see anything, this is an interesting description.\nFor, as far as it is genuine, it is characteristically hallucinatory. Dr. Speer's\ncorroboration to this seance is not recorded ; but the next day, during their\ntrip together in Ireland, he records that \" fifteen great lights showed them\nselves, varying from the size of an orange to that of a shaddock.\" (p. 321.)\nThe next day Dr. Speer recorded, in a longer account of the usual lights\nand hands, that the control speaking through Mr. Moses \"explained the\nprocess of making the lights, and told me that the folds I saw around them\nhanging down were really drapery, which he would prove to me. He then\nbrought the light close to my hand, and brushed it backwards and forwards\nwith as distinct a materialised drapery as can well be conceived. This feat\nhe repeated first on one hand and then on the other, five or six times, at the\nsame time directing my attention to the character of the light and the\ntangibility of the drapery.\" (p. 323.) This is an excellent example again of\nthe suggestion process, though a later direction to lean forward and close his\neyes till told to open them seems to complicate any explanation with a\nprobable element of trickery. The more permanent visibility of a cylindrical\nlight is recorded later ; forty-five minutes being given by Dr. Speer and\nfive minutes by Mr. Moses, who contrasts this with the other lights which\n\"have faded very rapidly, lasting from ten seconds to, perhaps, a minute.\"\n(pp. 325-6.) This discrepancy of its permanency is apparently a mistake\nof Dr. Speer's or a misprint, for later he records the same light \"for some\nminutes.\" (p. 328.)\nMrs. Speer's account is again given at another seance where she saw \"two\nor three very large lights. One must have measured with its drapery quite\ntwo feet in height ; he [the control] brought it close to my face, and brushed\nmy hands many times with the drapery ; he also touched my hand, and his\nhand felt as human as my own. The lights were not good, as Mr. S. M.\nwas ill, and the atmosphere was not right, and this interfered with their\ndevelopment. The medium then said he saw a fresh spirit standing by\nCatherine.\" (p 329). Though Mrs Speer did not see this figure she\nnoted that on joining the medium and Dr. Speer and \" sitting down, I saw\na bright figure standing behind Mr. S. M.\" (p. 329.) Neither of these\nfigures was seen by Dr. Speer, who only records : \" Three splendid lights\nappeared ; an arm was seen [not mentioned as seen by Mrs. Speer or Mr.\nMoses] ; drapery repeatedly thrown over us.'' (p. 329.) Mr. Moses' own\nexplanation of these lights is interesting. In this seance he recorded \"a\nnumber of lights, some of which were comparative failures, the nucleus only\nbeing visible. This nucleus Mentor has explained that he brings with him,\nand in unfavourable conditions he is not able to surround it with the\nluminosity which he gets from the circle.\" (p. 328.) At a seance throe\nweeks later he recorded: \"When we went up into the cabinet upstairs,\nMentor made some very clear lights, one of which endured over four minutes.\nI had been very anxious to try the duration of the light, because an imitation\nof such lights is made by phosphorised oil ; but lights so made are of very\n\f86 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.\nbrief duration. I believe a favourable trial would show that Mentor's light\nwould last seven or eight minutes.\" (p. 331.)\nIn the published notes from the second and subsequent years' experiences\n(Proceedings S.P.K., Vol. XI., pp. 24 to 114), we will not follow the lights\nmore in detail, Beyond the light reported by Dr. Speer (ibid. p. 31), which\n\"remained visible for upwards of forty minutes\" and the Prophet's little\nlight, which Mr. Moses records as giving answers through flashes during a\nlong conversation with him (p. 38), and which so seem more objective than\nhallucinatory, there is nothing new as compared with the first year's lights.\nIn only four cases is there the evidence of one of the sitters besides Mr.\nMoses. But a very suggestive feature in these later experiences is the\nincreased frequency of \"visions\" and human figures described by Mr.\nMoses. Only three figures were reported in the first year, one by Mrs.\nSpeer (IX. p. 302), and two by Mr. Moses (pp. 312 and 329), and on the\nhallucination theory we should expect that after the practice and suggestion-\ntraining of the first months there would be an increase of the more com-\nplicated and complete figures over the simpler lights with their partially\nvisible hands, arms, and drapery.\nMr. Moses recorded that he saw \" a veiled figure standing by Dr. S. Mrs.\nS. could see the light, but could not distinguish the figure.\" But later in the\nsame seance he was, \" as is frequently the case, clairvoyant, and described\nthe face of the Emperor, his waxed imperial and moustache, his impassive\nmarble face, and wound up by saying he was a ' regular Mephistopheles.'\nThe form was just in the same place and apparently could not come within\nthe circle.\" (XI., p. 33). Dr. Speer records this of the \" clairvoyant member\nof the circle,\" (p 34), but not of himself.\nNow occurs the first record of one of Mr. Moses' curious visions which\nhe had experienced twice before. (See pp. 36, 37). The next day also, \"on\ncoming out of the trance, I saw and described the spirit as one of command\ning mien, with a short robe girt round the waist, and a crown with a cross \u25ba{\u00ab\nin the centre, just as the Prophet has a star. In his hand he held a long\nwand, terminating in a cross. He said nothing, and gradually faded from\nview.\" (p. 37). Again a few days later Mr. Moses was clairvoyant and\ndescribed his grandmother again. \"She had a child with her. I also\ndescribed the Prophet and Theophilus, and several spirits who were\napparently at the ceiling over the table, and were showering down scent \"\n(p. 38) and he \"described clairvoyantly the Prophet and the Seer together\u2014\nthe latter a young and very beautiful spirit, the Prophet dignified and aged.\nAlso Grocyn and a tall spirit by Dr. Speer whom I did not know. There\nwas a deal of light in the room.\" (p. 40.) This latter condition Mrs.\nSpeer described as the room being \"filled with spirit light, large masses\nfloating about in every direction.\" (p. 40.) An interesting record in the\nhallucinatory objectivity of Mr. Moses' progress now occurred. \" In the\nmidst of the seance, when perfectly clear of influence, I saw Theophilus and\nthe Prophet. They were as clear and palpable to the eye as human beings\nwould bo in a strong light. Placing my hand over my eyes made no difference,\nbut turning away I could see them no longer. This experiment I repeated\nseveral times. I also saw the little Catherine. This is the first time I re\nmember being so clairvoyant in a seance without being previously entranced. \"\n\fpArtxxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 87\n(p. 43.) Five more figures are recorded, either by Mr. Moses or Mrs.\nSpeer, as seen by Mr. Moses alone, (pp. 45, 46, 48 and 58.) \"Once two\nvery clearly defined figures were near Dr. Thompson, visible to both of us,\"\n(i.e. to Mr. M. and Dr. T.'s son), (p. 52) but the latter's evidence is wanting.\nThe last recorded event of this class is another vision of Mr. Moses' (see\npp. 59 and 60).\nThese records extend over the first two and a half years of Mr. Moses'\nphenomena. Of the later experiences of the last three years the son of Dr.\nSpeer, Mr. Charlton T. Speer, has given a very suggestive summary.\n\" Numerous lights were generally visible to all the sitters. The lights were\nof two different kinds\u2014 objective and subjective ; the former were usually\nlike small illuminated globes, which shone brightly and steadily, often\nmoved rapidly about the room and were visible to all the sitters. A curious\nfact in connection with the.ie lights always struck me, viz., that looking\non to the top of the table one could see a light slowly ascending from the\nfloor and to all appearances passing out through the top of the table, the\ntable itself apparently not affording any obstacle to one's view of the light.\nIt is a little difficult to explain exactly what I mean, but had the top of the\ntable been composed of plain glass, the effect of the ascending light as it\nappeared to one's organs of vision, would have been pretty much the same\nas it was seen through the solid mahogany. Even then, to make the parallel\ncomplete, it would be necessary to have a hole in the glass top of the table,\nthrough which the light could emerge. The subjective lights were described\nas being large masses of luminous vapour, floating around the room and\nassuming a variety of shapes. However, Dr. Speer and myself being of\nentirely unmediumistic temperaments, we were only able to see the objectiee\nlights, but Mr. Stainton Moses, Mrs. Speer, and other occasional sitters\nfrequently saw and described those which were merely subjectiee. Another\ncurious point in relation to the objective lights was that, however brightly\nthey might shine, they never\u2014unlike an ordinary lamp \u2014threw any radiance\nround them or illuminated the smallest portion of the surrounding darkness\nwhen it ivas dark\u2014in the slightest degree.\" (Proceedings IX., pp. 345-6.)\nIt seems questionable whether the objective lights here described were not\npartly illusion, if not hallucination. The latter point of the non-radiance of\nthe objective light is contradictory to several of Dr. Speer's notes, as above\nquoted. (See Proceedings IX., p. 313.)\nOn collecting together the phenomena of hearing, there is much more\ndifficulty in separating the probably hallucinatory from the real sounds.\nBut with an undoubted large basis of real sound to be accounted for, there\nis besides, in the details of localisation, quantity and quality of sound,\nmuch which can most probably be explained as illusion. For in localisation,\ne.g., we know experimentally how helpless one is in distinguishing sound as\nfront or back and as to distance.\nIn my own experience in a semi-professional group of spiritualists, some\nraps, which I made on the legs of my chair in the middle of the circle, were\nlocalised by one of the circle as coming from a brie a-brac cabinet high up\non the wall, about eight feet to my left, and this was acquiesced in by\nothers. Again, Mrs. Gale and I, at a materialisation seance, had localised\nthe sounds of a mouth organ as coming from the cabinet about ten feet in\n\f88 Profexsor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.\nfront of vis, until Mrs. Gale stood at the cabinet curtain, when it seemed to\nbe about four feet to her right ; and only considerably later did we discover\nthat it came from a sitter immediately in front of us.\nThe \" fairy bells,\" described by Mr. Moses and Mrs. Speer, show well\nthese possibilities of illusion, if not of hallucination. Mrs. Speer records :\n\" I then heard a sweet tinkling sound like a clear bell close to my ear ; it\nmoved and played in front of the medium, who was still deeply entranced,\nand afterwards it played over the middle of the table, when Dr. S. heard it\nfor the first time. It was a striking manifestation ; the notes were so clear,\nsweet, and low\u2014we named it 'fairy bells.' \" And again : \"Before meeting\nthis evening we heard the ' fairy bells ' playing in different parts of the\ngarden, where we were walking ; at times they sounded far off, seemingly\nplaying at the top of some high elm trees, music and stars mingling together,\nthen they would approach nearer to us, eventually following us into the\nseance room, which opened on to the lawn. After we were seated the\nmmie still lingered with us, playing in the corners of the room, and then\nover the table round which we were sitting.\" (XI, pp. 56 and 57.)\nClairaudience is only reported by Mr. Moses himself in his group ;\nand, like the clairvoyance, coming more often, if not altogether, after the\nfirst year. He reports a long conversation with a figure, \"John C.\"\n(XI., p. 45), and \"Judge Edmunds\" (p. 49). Mr. Moses gives this sug\ngestive description:\u2014 \"The peculiarity of the seance was that when I\ncould hear the sound no one else could, and vice eersa. I heard by clair\naudience and not by natural hearing, being very deaf with my cold. On\nrequest I was enabled to hear the sound with my natural ear, but I\ndescribed it long before it was heard by the others, and heard it fre\nquently when they did not. At the same time I was unconscious of\nsounds apparently made on the table under my nose.\" (p. 50.)\nIn the sense of smell the phenomena were decidedly material, as judged\nby Mr. Percival's account (IX., pp. 272, 273), and Dr. Speer's : \"Scent\nthrown in great quantities \u2014so much was thrown at Mrs. S. 's eye as to\nproduce excruciating agony and congestion of the eye, with almost blind\nness for twenty-four hours \" (p. 328) ; and after a \" large quantity of\nSp. Pulegii . . . the dining-room cloth and my own nether habiliments\nhad to be exposed to view in the back garden ; and on the following\nmorning our dining-room floor and passage had to be freely fumigated\nwith pastilles.\" (p. 339).\nBut if the phenomena of smell were probably not hallucinatory, those of\ntouch, again, probably were. The touch of drapery on Dr. Speer's hand\n(pp. 275, 323) was promised by the medium as proof, and thus acted as\na most natural preparatory suggestion. As in the other senses, Mr. Moses'\nown experience here too was most real. He records : \u2014 \" The most curious\npart of the se'ance was that in which an elaborate attempt was made to\nrelieve my bronchitis. When we made the usual break, after sitting for about\nforty minutes, I was perfectly conscious of two materialised hands making\npasses over my head, throat, chest and back. . . . The sensation of\nthe hands was perfectly distinct and unmistakable.\" (XI., p. 49.)\nIn reviewing these experiences of Stainton Moses for a probable element\nof hallucination, I am, of course, aware that any reasonable deduction to\n\fPart xxxvi. A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 89\nbe made on account of this explanation from the unprecedented variety\nand great mass of his spiritistic phenomena (see IX., p. 336) will be\ncomparatively small. The overwhelming mass of the phenomena and all\nthe greatest marvels still remain unsolved. But from these I think\nanother indeterminable amount must be subtracted. For with this hallu\ncinatory tendency in the simplest phenomena, it seems probable that\nboth Mr. Moses' and his witnesses' accounts of the physical phenomena\nare unconsciously exaggerated and distorted ; and this to a degree beyond\nthe ordinary possibilities of mal-observation, owing to these special mental\ncharacteristics and to training conducive to hallucinations and illusions.\n(See Davey and Hodgson on the \" Possibilities of Mai-Observation \" :\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., 381, Vol. VIII., 252.) Though, as has\nbeen said, different persons will make various estimates of the amount\nof Mr. Moses' experiences which can reasonably be accounted for by\nhallucinations and illusions, yet it seems to me Dr. 8. 's case has been\nhelpful in giving us materials for some explanatory reduction of these\npuzzling spiritistic experiences. How the larger mass still remain\ning can be explained is a separate question, which, though out of\nthe bounds of this paper, I cannot but think can be similarly analysed\nas due to automatic writing, some small residuum of perhaps genuine\nphysical phenomena and telepathy, and more or less unconscious and\ndisinterested deception prompted by the pleasure of leadership and\nauthority. (See Mr. Podmore's treatment of Mr. Moses' case in his\nStudies in Psychical Research, 1897, pp. 115 to 119.) Some such analysis\nof these alleged spiritistic phenomena seems to me much more reasonable\nthan Mr. Myers's disjunctive that \"the permanent fraud of the whole\ngroup, or the substantial accuracy of all the records, are the only hypo\ntheses which seem to me capable of covering the facts,\" (Proceedings, IX.,\np. 254), and later, having excluded the former alternative, he concludes:\u2014\n\" I therefore regard the reported phenomena as having occurred in a\ngenuinely supernormal manner.\" (Proceedings, Vol. XI., p. 25.)\nThe allowance for hallucination in the high testimony to the phenomena\nof D.

Home has been suggested and followed out in some detail in Mr.\nPodmore's Sttuiies in Psychical Research (pp. 121-124).\nNote. \u2014For the study of hallucinations the greatest work by far is the\n\"Report on the Census of Hallucinations,\" by Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick\nand their Committee iu the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research,\nVol. X., 1894, pp. 25-422.

(Supplement.\nII.\nA CASE OF ALLEGED LOSS OF PERSONAL IDENTITY.\nThe following account is an abridged report of an alleged loss of\npersonal identity, and presents many features ditEcult of interpreta\ntion, and not without interest. It describes the history of a Mr. Hall,\ndiscovered at Mankato, Minnesota, at which place he declared that he\ncould not recall his past life. Upon further investigation this past\nlife was traced, and many conspicuous fraudulent facts ascertained in\nconnection with it. The man had an obvious reason for desiring to\nwreck his connection with the past : and an attempt to evade the\nconsequences of his acts, ingenious, but not unparalleled, might appear\nat first sight the simplest explanation. Yet those who have come into\npersonal contact with the man decline to accept this plausible\nhypothesis. The case seems more probably one of those obscure cases\non the borderland of abnormal personality\u2014cases where it is so\ndifficult to ascertain how much is responsible conscious decision, and\nhow much uncontrollable epileptic changes.\nOn the 14th of October, 1896, says Professor Harlow Gale : \u2014\nA gentlemanly and intelligent Englishman about 50 years of age walked\ninto Mankato, Minnesota, and registered at the City Hotel as \"John\nHarrison, St. Paul.\" The expenses of lodging and breakfast having ex\nhausted his money, he left the hotel the next morning, and wandered about\ntown all that day and the following night. In the morning he returned faint\nand weary to the hotel, told the clerk he had no money, and offered his\numbrella as security for breakfast. He then inquired for the Episcopal\nChurch, and thus found his way to the Rector of the church, Rev. George\nH. Davis, to whom he said he could not recall his past life. He knew he\nwas a churchman, showed an Episcopal Prayer Book, recalled having\npresented some girls from his Sunday School class for confirmation at some\nEaster two or three years ago ; had been in the habit of acting as lay-reader\nsomewhere, and had perhaps been in the furniture business. He knew,\nhowever, that his name was not Harrison, though he could not recall his real\nname. Bur, beyond these facts he said he remembered nothing ; could not\ntell whence he came into Mankato (except that he walked by a bluff and\nacross a bridge into town). His consecutive memory broke off at that point\ntwo days before. Having asked to be directed to a physician, Mr. Davis\ntook him to Dr. J. VV. Andrews, corner of Cherry and 2nd-streets, to\nwhom alone he told the same story. He was then further sure that his\nwife and children were dead ; that he had lost his valise and pocket-book,\nt did not know where or when. He thought he had left home several\n\fPart xxxvi. A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. 91\nweeks ago ; had had means ; had been in Winnipeg ; was engaged somewhere\nin business for himself, and that this was the first attack of the kind he\nhad had. He said he never tasted liquor, and was in apparent good health.\nSo he was taken to the hospital to await the probable recovery of his lost\nmemories. A week after his admission, hearing of the cyclone at St. Louis,\nhe said he recalled something how that injury looked. Acting on this\nsuggestion, Prof. C. F. Koehler, Psychologist at the State Normal School at\nMankato, gave him a railroad map. This he scanned till he came upon the\nMobile and Ohio railroad, which seemed familiar to him. Following this\nalong he came to Fruitdale, Ala., where he then recalled having been in the\nlumber business. After this experience he called on Mr. Davis, and seemed\nvery happy at being on the track of his identity. Shortly before this he\nhad, after some apparent effort, recalled the name of Blanchard, Chamber of\nCommerce, Chicago, with whom he had been in business. Through Dr.\nAndrews he had written him, telling him of his loss of identity, and asking\nfor help. Mr. B. replied that he thought he recognised the man from Dr.\nAndrews' description, and would come from Chicago to see him, whereat he\nwas happily excited. On November 5th Mr. Blanchard came, was gladly\nreceived by his former business associate, who now recalled the saw-mill and\nmost of the people in his employ. On Mr. B.'s telling him his name was\nJohn Hardcastle Hall, he then for the first time recalled that it was. He\ncould not remember when he left Fruitdale, or Mobile, but did recall being\nin Chicago in June. Only pleasant recollections seemed to return to Hall\nas he chatted and chuckled along with his former business friend.\nMr. B. now accused him in severe terms of dishonesty, and threatened\nhim with arrest. But, to \"liar, forger, embezzler, defaulter,\" etc., Hall only\nlistened in a dazed way, and with a surprised and hurt expression. He knew\nnothing of the \u00a7400 drawn in Mobile, nor of the \u00a7300 borrowed there, nor\ncould he account for some $2,300 sent, more than to think he must have\npaid it out. He asked why he should have been so anxious to send for\nMr. B. if such things had occurred, and he was liable to be prosecuted.\nMr. Blanchard, later in the day, gave an account of his connection with\nJ. H. Hall. It appeared that he had arrived at Fruitdale, Alabama, penni\nless ; he started a project of a saw-mill there, securing local support ; had\ncalled on Mr. Blanchard, presenting unexceptional references, none of them,\nhowever, extending into the immediately preceding seven years, and had\nfinally induced him to provide capital for the saw-mill. This Hall superin\ntended, sending monthly reports to Blanchard at Chicago, the accounts being\naltogether fraudulent, Hall intercepting all the money instead of paying the\nemployes.\n\" Hall was industrious to a high degree, feverishly active, the first at\nthe mill in the morning and the last to leave, always going hero and there,\nhut accomplishing nothing. He was not a good business man, yet the\nbusiness would have been successful had he acted squarely. He\nwas a master of lying and forged letters, and carried on a systematic course\nof deception. He did petty thieving when he could have gotten more from\nme. He forged a letter purporting to be written by one Slater to himself,\nsaying that the writer had \u00a71,500 to invest, and would give it to Hall to use in\nthe business if he (Slater) could have a position. I was led to believe that this\n\f92 A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. [Supplement.\nwas done, and that Hall had put this money into the business ; yet I after\nwards learned that the letter was a forgery and not attempted to be an\nimitation of Slater's handwriting. Slater was a common deck hand on a\nboat and had no money, but Hall gave him a good position to keep up the\ndeception, but did not pay him anything. Hall put no money into the\nbusiness.\n\" Hall's non-payment of his men and the storekeepers began to make them\nclamorous for money, and he came back two weeks later and wanted money.\nI had none then, but told him to go back to the State line and I would\ntelegraph him $400 then. This was done. Hall got on the train for\nFruitdale, and when the train arrived there the labourers were on the\nplatform, demanding their money. The foreman rushed in and stated that\nthe men were highly excited and that they must be paid. Hall coolly took\nfrom his pocket a big roll of bills and told the foreman that he had more\nthan enough money to pay every man. He then took from another pocket\na big package of what purported to be bills and handed it to the foreman,\nsaying that there was the exact amount to pay the men. The foreman took\nthe package and got off just as the train was pulling out. He found on\nexamination that the package was merely paper cut up and shaved down to\nthe size of bills and wrapped in paper.\n\"Hall went on to Mobile that night and borrowed \u00a7300 from a friend and\nthen disappeared, but has never been seen or heard of since, until I met\nhim to-day. He wrote to me on June 17th on stationery of a prominent\nMobile hotel where he was not stopping, saying that he was feeling sick\nthat day, and that ' the mental strain and worry of the last 14 days has\nalmost broken me up.' This was the day that he disappeared and the last that\nI ever heard from him. He got about $10,000 of my property on a tissue of\nfalsehoods.\n\" Hall was the reverse in his habits of what a defaulter usually is. He\nwas frugal and stingy, and his habits were correct, and he never tasted\nliquor. At Chicago, if I did not invite him to my house, he would go to a\ntwenty cent lodging house and a ten cent lunch counter. He does not act\ndifferently now from what he did when I knew him before. There is the\nsame timid hesitancy in his bearing. Although he was a systematic embezzler,\nI shall not have him arrested or prosecute him, as I do not care to be\nrevengeful, and he has no means that I know of.\n\"His is a most curious case. I don't think that he was crazy during the\nsix months that he was in business with me, and I am at a loss to know\nwhether he is feigning his present condition. If he is, which I think\nprobable, he may have sent for me on account \"f being oppressed by the\nfear of arrest. He can remember the good that he has done and forget the\nevil, for he seems not to remember his bad deeds in Alabama.\"\u2014Manlato\nFree Press.\nIn a final private conversation with Hall the following day before\nreturning to Chicago, Mr. B. talked very kindly, offering to forget the past\nand to furnish Hall with money to go wherever he wished to make a fresh\nstart if he would only tell Mr. B. what he really knew. At this Hall broke\ndown in tears and sobs, but could recollect nothing more and could not\naccept the offered assistance.\n\fPart xxxvi.] A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. 93\nOn the other hand, a Mr. W. P. Stuart, who had known Hall in\nFruitdale, wrote on November 4th to the effect that he was convinced of\nHall's honesty, and that his affairs, although involved, would have been by\nno means hopeless but for his flight. With regard to the question of Hall's\nmental condition, a letter was received from a clergyman who had known\nhim in Dallas, Tex., and who spoke of him as having been temporarily\ninsane. In response to enquiries there came the following letter : \u2014\n\" State of New York\u2014Manhattan State Hospital,\n\" Ward's Island, New York City,\n\" March 22nd, 1898.\n\"A. E. Macdonald, M.D.,\n\" General Superintendent.\n\" Male Department,\n\" Percy Bryant, M.D.,\n\" Medical Superintendent.\n\" Dear Sir, \u2014 I beg to say, in reply to your inquiries, that on the 27th\nof August, 1895, a patient named John Harrison, alias Hall, was admitted\nto this hospital. The patient was discharged before I assumed charge here\nas Superintendent, and therefore I am unable to give you any information\nderived from personal observation. He was discharged November 12th of\nthe same year, and sent to Dallas, Texas, where his parents lived. [?] It\nappears from the records that correspondence had been had with Rev.\nEdward Wickens, of Dallas.\n\"The records further show that the patient, upon admission here, was\ndull, depressed, and could give little information of himself, except to state\nthat he had been in New York City a few days. It also appears that he\nwas much confused. When released he had recovered from his depression\nand physical inactivity. \u2014Very truly yours,\n\" Percy Bryant,\n\" Medical Superintendent.\n\" Harlow Gale, Esq.,\n\" Instructor, Univ. of Minnesota,\n\" Minneapolis, Minn.\"\nThis former condition, resembling his present, except with only a few\ndays' loss of memory, occurred then shortly before the starting of the\nFruitdale lumber scheme in which he interested Mr. Blanchard.\nIt appeared later, from articles in St. Paul papers, that in 1893 Hall had\nbeen obliged to leave Seattle, where he had had the management of a large\nbox factory. But no serious dishonesty had been alleged against him there.\nHis career in Seattle was terminated by the discovery that he had undergone\na term of imprisonment in St. Quentin, California. Of the particulars of\nthis affair in California very little seems to be known. From Seattle Hall\nwent to Dallas ; then followed his stay at the N.Y. State Insane Hospital,\nand some time after that the Fruitdale venture. An attempt was made to\nobtain from him some connected account of his career by means of\nhypnotism, but with very little success.\nFinding no employment in Mankato, he went to Minneapolis in December,\n1896. There, while seeking some opening in business, he took a prominent\n\f94 A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. [Supplement.\npart in church work, and won the good opinion of his neighbours. But in\nthe autumn of 1897 he disappeared once more, leaving behind him no few\nunpaid bills and an impaired reputation. He was in Cincinnati during the\nwinter of 1897-8, and since then nothing more has been heard of him.\nAfter examining Hall's career, Professor Gale concludes as\nfollows :\u2014\nWhen one now looks back at this strange mental composition to analyse\nand classify it, there appear to mo two important characteristics connecting\nhim over toward the insane :\u2014\n1. A delusion of grandeur (\" Grossowahn \"), as shown in his restless\nactivity and pleasure in these series of large schemes started on such small\nfoundations. His absorption in them was intense, leaving him no interest\nfor other things except his church. In my interviews with him he could\nnot get away from talk about himself ; some brain micro-photographs, which\n1, for this purpose, showed and explained to him, had no interest. In hiR\nchurch, even, he pushed himself forward everywhere in an unusually com\nmanding way.\n2. The common delusion of persecution was an easier explanation of his\nseries of failures than the reasonable and evident lack of foresight, capital,\nand honesty. But no such reasoning would affect him. The reversed\njudgment of his friends, who came to know him thoroughly, was explained,\ntoo, in this way.\nWith these two characteristics (which are only exaggerations of the\nnormal mental components of pleasure in activity and success and of\nsuspicion) is specially connected the question of his consciousness of, and\nresponsibility for, his dishonest practices, however great or small they\nreally have been. That he is not a deliberate and conscious knave or even\ndeceiver seems to me reasonably sure. And as, therefore, the ordinary\nmotives which influence the average mental complex do not come into his\nconsciousness with inhibitory or motor force, he is not responsible as is the\naverage man. His case is of much interest as an example of the many\ncomponents of knowledge, feeling, and motor reaction which constitute the\nmanifold complex \"mind,\" and the limitless variety of these combinations,\nwith the wide transition region between sanity and insanity. In its non-\nresponsibility the case illustrates the modern \" necessity \" of willing as a\nreign of law in mental life as against the old metaphysical \" freedom.\" His\nwould be a case for restraint and not punishment.\nAs to the genuineness of his loss of personal identity, it seems to me, in\nsome degree at least, genuine, and perhaps entirely so. His unstable,\nnervous temperament, with its excessive activity and disposition to worry\nand suspicion, were favourable to such a catastrophe. For the first collapse\nin August, 1895, though only of short duration, there seems no motive for\ndeception, except to gain a retreat and rest. And if the first one was\ngenuine, the still greater stress of circumstances, which culminated in\nJune, 1896, was enough to cause a greater mental rupture. However,\nthe suspicious limits of his recovered memories remind one of the often\nwonderfully ingenious reasoning and cunning self-control of the insane,\nand give much evidence to the probability that with some real loss of\n\fPart xxxvi.] A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. 95\nmemories he consciously or unconsciously\u2014as it seems to me more likely\u2014\nused his more or less mental break to cover his dishonesties.\nI am fortunate to be able to append the following examination of Hall\nby Dr. H. A. Tomlinson, superintendent of the St. Peter State Hospital for\nthe Insane, and gratified at the approach of my conclusion to his judgment\nfounded on such greater knowledge and experience.\nMarch 23rd, 1898.\n. . \" The man was undoubtedly an epileptic, the muscular out\nbreak being absent and replaced by the establishment of so-called double\nconsciousness. This was evidenced by his conduct and history, both as\ngiven by himself and learned from others afterwards. I did not know\nanything about Mr. Hall's ever having been in a hospital for the insane, but\nshould not be surprised to learn that he had been in several, for that is the\nusual history of such cases. I did not make any notes of my examination\nof this man, and my recollection is hazy as to details. I remember,\nhowever, having noticed several of the stigmata of degeneracy, and among\nthem some asymmetry in arterial distribution and location. Besides, the\nradial artery on one side was quite small, while on the other it was\ndisproportionately large. Several similar cases to this one have been\nreported, and one I knew myself much more peculiar than this one.\nThere is no doubt but that this man was markedly defective morally, and\ntraded on his peculiar mental condition, of which he was more conscious\nthan he was willing to admit or recognise. These cases seem very clear to\nme, presenting only exaggerations of those characteristics which make the\nconfidence man and dead-beat conspicuous, the difference being that one\nacts with definite purpose and from preconceived plans, while the other is\nthe creature of environment, apparently acting automatically upon the\nsuggestions of those around them.\"\nIn the prosecution and preparation of this study I wish to express my\nsincere thanks for the kindness and aid of Rev. George H. Davis, Dr. J. W.\nAndrews, Prof. C. F. Koehler, Mr. E. F. Searing, of the Mwnkato Free\nPress, and Dr. H. A. Tomlinson.\n\f96 F. C. S. Schiller. [Supplement.\nIII.\nNOTE BY MR. F. C. S. SCHILLER\non his Review of Prof. Munsterbero's \"Psychology and Mysticism\"\n(in Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXXV., p. 348).\nI am informed that I have given great offence to Professor Miinsterberg\nby quoting incompletely (in the last number of these Proceedings, p. 358) a\npassage from the article on \"Psychology and Mysticism,\" which I criticised\nand which he has since republished in a book entitled Psychology and Life.\nI feel, therefore, that I owe Professor Miinsterberg the reparation of a full\nquotation and the readers of the Proceedings an explanation of how the\nomission came about.\nProfessor Miinsterberg's full context runs as follows (Atlantic Monthly,\np. 78; Psychology and Life, p. 260): \"Why do I avoid these seances? It\nis not because-I am afraid that thoy would shake my theoretical views and\nconvince me of mysticism, but because I consider it undignified to visit such\nperformances, as one attends a variety shoto, for amusement only, without\natternptiiuj to explain them, and because I know that I should be the last man\nto see through the scheme and discover the trick.\"\nThe clause which I have italicised was omitted by me (with the due\nasterisks) simply because it seemed to me to convey the unjust and\noffensive innuendo, which recurs with such deplorable frequency in his\narticle, viz., that no one can be supposed to take an honest, serious and\nscientific interest in the topics of Psychical Research. Now I had already\nprotested against this assumption on p. 350 of my article, and so did not\nthink it necessary to draw attention to a passage whose only novelty seemed\nto consist in the indication it seemed to afford of a habit of attending variety\nshows on the part of Professor Miinsterberg. Of course if I could have\nanticipated that this omission would really prevent Professor Miinsterberg\nfrom defending himself against the somewhat damaging charge of having\nrecklessly misconstrued the whole position of the S.P.R., I should have been\ndelighted to quote him at any length.\nAs it is, I regret rather that 1 quoted so much and did not omit the first\nclause also. For, I may point out, it was not really and seriously relevant to\nmy general argument, or even to the immediate discussion, which at that\npoint consisted mainly of \"chaff\" about the \"surpassing inuocency of his\ncharacter \" to which Professor Miinsterberg had so ingenuously confessed.\nOn the whole, therefore, I may assure the readers of Proceedings that my\nposition with regard to the passage complained of is thoroughly defensible,\nthough I forbear to show this more fully lest I should continue to give\noffence to Professor Miinsterberg.\nWith regard to that gentleman himself, I can only say that if he feels\nhurt I am sorry, but that he himself provoked the tone of my criticism by\n\fPartxxxvi.] Note on Review of Professor Miinsterberg. 97\nthe tone of his article. The S.P.It. has always welcomed criticism ; it has\nendured much that was not always inspired by that fulness of knowledge\nand accuracy of statement which are so conducive to the effectiveness of a\ncriticism. But the time has come when it need no longer offer both cheeks\nto any smiter who chooses to arm himself, not with reason, but merely with\nthe professorial handle to his name. Nevertheless, I believe I am expressing\nonly the general sentiment of the S.P.R. in saying that, as soon as there is\nmanifested on Profesbor Miinsterberg's side any disposition to drop the mis\nplaced and irritating tone of professorial superiority and a priori dogmatism,\nthere will be no persistence in the persiflage which was needed to defend the\ninterests of the S.P.R. from being crushed by the weight of authority in the\neyes of the general public. And as soon as it is admitted by Professor\nMiinsterberg that on our side also there are men who are honestly desirous\nof truth and fact, we shall readily respond by admitting that truth and fact\nare far more likely to be elicited by co-operation for truly scientific\npurposes and by truly scientific methods, than by recrimination. And even\nif co-operation should prove impracticable, the field of psychology is surely\nwide enough to admit of the toleration of those who, in a truly scientific\nspirit, though perhaps with more than the usual scientific boldness, have\nventured to penetrate into a vast and intricate mass of residual phenomena.\n\f98 Frank Podmore. [Supplement.\nIII.\nREVIEWS.\nThe Alleged Haunting of B House, including a journal kept during the\ntenancy of Colonel Le Mesurier Taylor. Edited by A. Goodrich-Freer\n(Miss X.), and John, Marquess of Bute, K.T. (London: George\nRedway. 1890.)\nThis is the house of which Mr. Myers wrote to the Times in June, 1897 :\n''I visited B , representing that Society [the S.P.R.] . . . and\ndecided that there was no such evidence as could justify us in giving the\nresults of the inquiry a place in our Proceedings.\"\nFrom the evidential standpoint Mr. Myers' verdict was no doubt right ;\nbut nevertheless the Editors, who prefix the above quotation as a motto to\ntheir book, are in my judgment fully justified in publishing the result of\nthat inquiry. Of the hundreds of accounts of haunted houses contributed\nduring the last seventeen years to the Society's archives, we have very few\u2014\nprobably not more than four or five\u2014in which the evidence is based, to any\nconsiderable extent, on contemporary documents, and any addition to this\nsmall number is therefore very welcome.1 And B House is a fairly\ntypical case. The Editors bring forward what appears to be ample proof that\nthe house had the reputation of being haunted for many years prior to their\nvisit, though the manifestations on which that reputation rested would seem\nto have consisted mainly of inexplicable sounds ; there is but little first\nhand evidence for visual phantasms prior to 1897, and where first-hand\ndocuments are quoted, they do not always bear a date (see e.g., pp. 13 and\n17). But the phenomena during Colonel Taylor's tenancy were surprisingly\nnumerous and varied, and were recorded day by day and with all needful\nfulness.\nFor all that, the journal is quite unimpressive. Partly, no doubt, this\nvery want of impressiveness is a tribute to the excellence of the record ;\nif the ghostly sights and sounds in other haunted houses had been as faith\nfully set down day by day, they might be found to make even duller\nreading.\nBut there are other reasons why this laborious journal of \" phenomena \"\nfails to impress. The inexplicable incidents recorded consist mainly of\nsounds, occurring most frequently at night, but not seldom also in the day\ntime, which are described by numerous witnesses as being unusually striking,\ndistinct, and varied in character. No experiment, however, was made to\ndetermine the actual source of the sounds. A phonograph is mentioned\n1 One such case is recorded in Proceedings, VIII., p. 331, another in Proceedings,\nVI., p. 266. One or two other casea will be found in the Journal.\n\fPart xxxvi.] Review. 99\nin the early part of the book, but it was never employed. The house, as\nthe Editors inform us, stands in a well-known seismic area ; but a seismo\nmeter was actually introduced only on the last night of the tenancy, when\nthe noises had already ceased to be heard. But apart from the use of\ninstruments requiring, probably, expert handling, there is much that might\nhave been done and was not done. The bedrooms, or some of them, were\nfitted with fixed basins, with pipes communicating with the outer air ; and\nthe whole house was furnished with a system of hot water pipes, which\nwere in working order during part of the period under consideration. Some\nexperiment might surely have been made to determine whether these metal\npipes, contracting or expanding under changes of temperature, had anything\nto do with the sounds heard. Miss Freer and her coadjutor do not appear\neven to have determined whether or not the sounds which they described day\nafter day were objective. Professor Lodge thinks that they were, but \"not\nimpressive,\" and \" not distinct enough to be evidential \" (pp. 192-200).\nColonel Taylor writes, \" I heard many noises in the night during my stay at\nB , but they were of much the same sort I have been accustomed to hear\nat a similar time in other houses. I think that some of our witnesses may\nhave given them undue prominence under the influence of their own\nexpectancy. The clairvoyant visions of ' Ishbel ' in the grounds are not of\ngreat evidential value for the scientific world in general, and I think that\nany amount of ' voices ' could be read into the noises of the running stream,\nnear where she is seen, by those who wished to hear. Still there are some\nobjective noises which cannot be easily accounted for in an ordinary way \"\n(p. 153).\nBut, after all, the main reason why the recital of these various mani\nfestations fails to impress us has still to be told. It was Miss Freer who\nfirst saw a ghostly figure ; it was again Miss Freer who first heard ghostly\nnoises, and throughout these records it is Miss Freer who is most frequently\nand most conspicuously favoured with \"phenomena.\" Miss Freer has\nshown that she knows how to observe clearly and how to record accurately,\nbut, for all that, her testimony in a matter of this kind carries very little\nweight.\nOf course I intend nothing in derogation of Miss Freer's moral and\nintellectual qualifications. Miss Freer's testimony to ghostly sights and\nsounds fails to impress because she is liable, in a quite unusual degree,\nto hallucinatory experience, and because many of her hallucinations, as\nshe has herself shown in her article on Crystal Vision (Proceedings V.,\npp. 486 el seq.), are purely subjective, being merely the recrudescence\nof previous sensory or intellectual experiences. Miss Freer is not, of\ncourse, responsible for this mental idiosyncrasy, but, obviously, it seriously\nimpairs the value of her testimony to experiences which owe their in\nterest, for most readers, solely to the presumption that they may not\nbe of a purely hallucinatory order, but may possibly have their origin in\ntelepathic or even extra-human sources. But we are entitled to ask why\nMiss Freer does not apply to her visions in \" haunted \" houses the same\ncanons which she has applied with conspicuous success to her visions in the\ncrystal. When, to take a well-known case, Miss Freer saw in the crystal a\nvision of a sea-shore succeeded by the vision of a huge mouse (Proceedings\nH 2\n\f100 Frank Podmore. [Supplement.\nV., p. 512), she found the explanation of the incongruous spectacle in the\nrevival of subconscious images called up in her mind a few days before by\ntwo lines of poetry :\u2014\n\" Only the sea intoning,\nOnly the wainscoat mouse.\"\nNow consider the following experience in B House. \" In the\nafternoon (February 6th, 1897) an experiment was made with the apparatus\nknown as a Ouija board, and this, as is very often the case, resolved itself,\nafter a time, into automatic writing. There is in the library a portrait of a\nvery handsome woman, to which no name is attached, but which shows the\ncostume of the last century. Her name was asked, and the word ' Ishbel '\nwas given several times. ... In reply to questions as to what could be\ndone that was of use and interest, the writers were told to go at dusk, and\nin silence, to the glen in the avenue, and this, rightly or wrongly, some of\nthose present identified with what had been called Scamp's Copse \" (i.e., a\nsmall fir plantation, at which the dog had twice already barked uneasily).\nThey went to the copse accordingly, and Miss Freer saw there, in the dusk,\nthe figure of a nun. Upon this Miss Freer builds a theory of the identity\nof the nun with the Ishbel named by Ouija ; but as the figure seen did not\ncorrespond with the portrait already referred to, she finds the original of\nher vision in one Isabella (Gaelic, Ishbel), a sister of a former owner of the\nhouse, who had actually taken the veil. Again, since the figure of the nun\nas seen did not apparently tally with the figure of the lady whom it was\nassumed to represent, the theory is still further elaborated by the assump\ntion that the figure seen by Miss Freer reflected the (hypothetical) mental\npicture of the real nun formed in the mind of a former inmate of the house,\nwho had never seen the lady in the flesh ! (p. 226, etc.) For myself, I\ncan more easily believe that the nun, like the mouse, had her birth in the\npercipient's imagination.\nWhatever view we take of the matter, it is a point of some interest that\ntwo witnesses\u2014one other lady and one man, the Rev. Mr. Q.,\u2014after they\nhad heard what Miss Freer had seen, saw the nun in her company ; and\nthat several persons, when the burn was running, hoard the nun and her\ncompanion conversing. The only other experience of evidential importance\nwas the vision of a crucifix, seen independently by the Rev. Mr. Q., Miss\nFreer, and a gentleman who had stayed in the house some years previously.\nThe account of the last named, however, is given some years after the\nincident, and after he had heard of the later experiences.\nIt should be added that Miss Freer saw one or two other human figures,\nand dogs, about the house at various times ; that a servant also saw a\nfigure, and that a visitor, Miss Langton, had a dream in which she saw\nthe figure of a man, afterward recognised from her description. Of the\npulling off of bedclothes, the feeling of chill, the sensation of a presence, and\nother vague feelings of the kind, it is hardly necessary to speak.\nThe phenomena ceased after a service performed by a Bishop on the\nmorning of May 6th.\nFrank Podmore.\n\fPart xxxvl] Revieiu. 101\nNeurypnology : or, The Rationale of Nervous Sleep considered in, relation to\nAnimal Magnetism or Mesmerism, and illustrated by Numerous Cases of\nits successful Application in the Relief and Cure of Disease. By James\nBraid, M.R.C.S., C.M.W.S., etc. A New Edition, edited with an\nIntroduction Biographical and Bibliographical embodying the Author's\nlater Views and further Evidence on the Subject. By Arthur Edward\nWaite. (London : George Redway ; 1899.)\nThe above work comprises : (1) a biographical introduction, which gives\na short account of Braid's life, and a more extended one of his writings ;\n(2) a reproduction of the original edition of NeuryImology, which forms the\ngreater bulk of the volume ; (3) an appendix of editorial notes chiefly drawn\nfrom Braid's later works ; and (4) a bibliography of Braid's writings.\nAccording to Mr. Waite little is known about Braid in this country, and\nthere is no trustworthy bibliography of his writings. His later works, rare\nand almost unknown, have been traced with difficulty. Mr. Waite, however,\nclaims to have been successful in his researches, and presents, as their\nresult, a work on Braid which he asserts to be substantially complete.\nMr. Waite has undoubtedly rendered a service to hypnotic literature, but\nhe has not made the most of the material collected, and his work is neither\nas complete nor as accurate as he believes it to be. The following are a few,\namongst many, objections which might be urged against it. Thus, we are\ntold that the discovery of hypnotism alone lifted Braid out of the groove of\nthe ordinary practitioner. This is incorrect. Before he discovered hypno\ntism, Braid had operated on 262 cases of Talipes, 700 cases of Strabismus,\nand 23 cases of Spinal Curvature, and his reputation as a surgeon attracted\npatients from all parts of the country.\nAlthough Nenrypnology is historically interesting, it must not be\nforgotten that it was written almost immediately after Braid commenced\nhis hypnotic work, and that later his views underwent a complete change.\nThe French translation of Nenrypnology is more valuable than Mr. Waite's\nreprint, as in an appendix of 36 pages it gives a full translation of Braid's\nlast manuscript, containing a summary of his more matured theories. This\nis barely referred to by Mr. Waite.\nSome passages show a somewhat unusual want of care in compilation.\nThus (pages 317 to 319) a case of torticollis cured by suggestion is recorded\nat length, and we are told that a year later there had been no relapse. The\ncase is repeated (pages 343 to 344) along with the fresh statement that\n\"whether the cure was permanent does not appear from the narrative.\"\nThe bibliography, to which Mr. Waite attaches great importance, only\nimperfectly reproduces those I myself published at earlier dates (Brain,\nPart LXXIII., Spring, 1896 ; Proceedings of the Society for Psychical\nRtxearch, Part XXX., June, 1896; Reene de VHypnotisme, June, 1898).\nIn seven of the works referred to by Mr Waite, the title is wrong or\nincomplete ; in twenty-one, quoted from medical journals, neither volume\nnor page is given. The only new material is two unimportant letters in\nreply to one from \"James Simpson, Esq., Advocate,\" erroneously described\nby Mr. Waite as \"James Singer,\" while in my bibliographies are to be\nfound nine of Braid's writings which are omitted from Mr. Waite's.\n\f102 .\/. Milne Bram well. [Supplement.\nFurther, some of Braid's works, of which Mr. Waite has been unable to\ntrace a single copy, have long been in my possession.\nAccording to Mr. Waite, Braid's connection with the debated subject\nof phrenology terminated with the phreno-hypnotic experiments recorded\nin \" Keurypnulogy.\" The subject, we are told, remains where he left it,\nwhile Dr. Foveau de Oourmelle's verdict, viz., that the phenomena are\nas likely to bo the result of real action as of unconscious suggestion, is\naccepted by the unprejudiced. Mr. Waite is ignorant of, or ignores,\nBraid's later experiments. From these Braid concluded that all phreno\nlogical phenomena were the result of direct or indirect suggestion, and\narose either from a previous knowledge of phrenology, or from a system\nof training during hypnosis. They manifested themselves when points\nwere touched which audible suggestion had taught the subjects to associate\nwith particular ideas. Further, pressure upon the head was not necessary,\nand the associations could be established in the same artificial way between\nthe phenomena and other parts of the body. Finally, the excitation of the\nmuscles of expression was capable of arousing corresponding ideas in the\nsubject's mind.\nIt is certainly surprising to be told at the present day that the phenomena\nof phrenology are as likely as not to be genuine.\nMr. Waite's account of Braid's views on mesmerism or animal magnetism\ndemands serious notice. Formerly, according to him, it was generally but\nerroneously believed that Braid opposed animal magnetism ; thanks, how\never, to French writers, this error has been rectified. Braid was the\nchampion and witness of animal magnetism, and placed the central fact of\nmesmerism beyond all further dispute. In opposition to this, it is to be\nnoted, and the point cannot be too strongly insisted upon, that the primary\nand cardinal fact upon which Braid founded all his theories of hypnotism\nwas the purely subjective origin of its phenomena. Everything depended\non the physical and mental condition of the patient ; not on the volition\nor passes of the operator which threw out magnetism, or called into action\nsome occult fluid or medium. Braid never swerved from this view. Later\nhe repeated it more emphatically and demonstrated experimentally that all\nthe phenomena attributed to magnets, metals, drugs in sealed tubes, could\nbo equally well produced by direct or indirect suggestion when the exciting\nagents were absent. Thus, a wooden magnet acted like a real one when\nthe subject was deceived as to its nature, whereas a genuine one produced\nnothing if the subject did not know it was there.\nAccording to Mr. Waite, \" The metalo-therapeutic theory first discovered\nby Burq and developed by Charcot, inaugurated a new era of hypnotism,\nand led to that long series of researches connected with the Salpetriere\nSchool of Paris, which have done so much to obscure, if not indeed to\ntarnish, the rival lustre of the Nancy School of Lie'bault. \"\nThis view of metallo-therapeutics is many years too late. The views of\nBurq, which were shared by F.lliotson and the mesmerists of his day, were\nsuccessfully combatted by Braid. Charcot simply revived an old fallacy,\nwhich the Nancy School, following in Braid's footsteps, again overthrew.\nAs far back as the International Congress of Psychology of 1892 the\nCharcot theories had practically ceased to excite scientific interest.\n\fPart xxxvi.] Review. 103\nAccording to Mr. Waite, \" It has been rightly observed that Braid, the\ndiscoverer, so to speak, of suggestion, by no means fully realised the\npossibilities of suggestion of the unconscious kind.\" Bernheim, and other\nwriters unacquainted with Braid's later works, had previously made similar\nstatements. It is difficult, however, to understand how Mr. Waite could\ncommit a like error. Braid repeatedly, clearly and emphatically pointed\nout that unconscious suggestion accounted for all the phenomena which the\nmesmerists attributed to magnets, metals, and occult fluids. Sometimes, he\nsaid, the suggestions were given in their most obvious form by the operator\nverbally predicting in the subject's hearing the nature of the phenomena\nwhich ought to appear. At others they were given less directly by passes,\nmanipulations, excitation of the muscles of expression, etc., but these owed\ntheir power, not to their physical influence, but to the ideas thoy excited in\nthe subject's mind. When all forms of suggestion were rigorously excluded\nthe mesmeric phenomena did not appear. This, Braid asserted, proved the\ninfluence was a mental one ; were it electric, suggestions were as unnecessary\nin the case of the subject as in that of a galvanic battery.\nApparently Mr. Waite believes in animal magnetism, metallo-therapeutics\nand phrenology. All these things Braid successfully combatted, and to\nattribute to him any belief in their existence shows an absolute failure to\ngrasp the spirit and significance of his teaching.\nJ. Milne Buoiwell.\nMy Experience of Hypnotic Suggestion as a Therapeutic Agent. By Hon.\nJ. M. Creed, M.L.O., M.R.C.S. Eng., L.R.C.P. Edin., Sydney.\n(Sydney, 1899.)\nThis paper is reprinted from Tlie Australian Medical Gazette, of January\n20th, 1899, and was originally read before the N.S.W. Branch of the British\nMedical Association, on December 23rd, 1898. The author is a well-known\nmedical man and a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales,\nso his views demand attention. He has been using hypnotism in his\npractice for some years, and he recalls his experience in this pamphlet.\nThe interest of the paper is almost entirely medical, and, like Professor\nBernheim of Nancy, the author hypnotises patients for all kinds of diseases,\nand finds suggestion relieves symptoms, even where it does not cure the\ndisease. For instance, in a case of pleurisy, accompanied by much pain, he\nwas able to give entire relief by suggestion, and it was only by the per\nsistence of the physical signs that he was able to assure himself that the\npathological condition still existed. As he points out, the control of pain is\na very important matter in many cases, for pain lowers vitality, prevents\nsleep, and retards recovery. This is especially the case in surgery, where\nmental and bodily repose are greatly conducive to satisfactory and rapid\nrepair. Dr. Creed is quite enthusiastic about the effect of suggestion in\ngastric ulcer. Here, he thinks, it acts by enabling the patient to take\nnourishment freely without pain, and so cures the ulcers by improving\nthe state of the blood and raising the tone of the system.\nOn several occasions the patient has, in the absence of the surgeon,\nbeen able to control pain by inducing amesthesia by a prearranged signal.\n\f104 Dr. Charles Lloyd Tuckey. [Supplement.\nFor instance, Mr. H. burnt his hand severely with molten and flaming\n\" Chatterton's compound,\" the melting point of which is very much higher\nthan that of sealing-wax. By placing the forefinger of his left hand to his\nlips he was able to inhibit the sensory nerves, and though the injury was\nfollowed by deep ulceration, he felt no pain while the wound was healing.\nPain, of course, serves a useful purpose, and is Nature's danger-signal\nto direct attention and care to the part. Without it, serious injury might\nbe done without the subject being aware of it, as sometimes happens in\nhysterical and paralysed persons. But pain is nearly always in excess of\nrequirements, and it is a great blessing to be able to control it.\nDr. Creed seems to have been very successful in asthma, and he men\ntions a curious experience in this disease. The patient was a clerk in a\nGovernment office, and had suffered from asthma for 14 years. Hypnotism\ngreatly relieved her, and she only got attacks when she took cold. When\naway from Sydney, she used to write to the doctor and ask him to send\ndirections by telegraph, and these suggestions always gave her relief. On\none occasion he was away, and her friends arranged that a telegram should\nbe sent as if from him in reply to her note. It failed to relieve her, as she\nsaid she knew somehow it was not genuine. On his return ho sent another\ntelegram, and that proved successful. It is difficult to believe that the\ncurative agency was anything but expectant attention and suggestion in this\ncase, and one would like to know if there was not something in the form of\nthe first telegram or in the behaviour of her friends which aroused the\npatient's suspicions.\nDr. Creed has treated many bad cases of alcoholism with great success ;\nand he says that no one who is a good hypnotic subject need suffer from\nsea-sickness.\nLike all medical hypnotists, Dr. Creed finds his best subjects among the\nintellectual and healthy-minded classes, and he even says that he has\ngenerally found hysterical women are not hypnotisable. He is strongly of\nopinion that the dangers of hypnotism are overstated, and he contends that\na hypnotised person cannot be made to do anything opposed to his waking\nconscience. There we must beg to differ from Dr. Creed, and we think it is\nmuch better not to minimise the dangers of hypnotism, but to look them in\nthe face and take the proper precautions against them. Granted that a\nperson of strong principle cannot be induced to commit a crime whilst in the\nhypnotic state, or by means of post-hypnotic suggestion ; but we know that\nmany people only refrain from doing evil from expediency or fear. These are\nthe weak-kneed people who are often too easily influenced without hypno\ntism. By suggestion with hypnotism the power to influence them is greatly\nincreased, and the danger of this fact is not decreased by ignoring it. The\nremedy is, of course, easy. Let hypnotism be used with the same pre\ncautions as surround the administration of chloroform or laughing gas.\nThere is one other feature of Dr. Creed's excellent paper which we think\nmight be amended with advantage. It is too much a record of success, and\nthough he disclaims considering hypnotism a universal panacea, we should\nlike to be told what proportion of failures he has met with. However, in\nthis respect Dr. Creed is in good professional company, for medical men who\nwrite on their special subject are notoriously optimistic.\n\fPartxxxvLi Review. 105\nIt must be a matter of gratification to the Society for Psychical Research\nto see one of the subjects Edmund Gurney and its other founders did so\nmuch to bring to the front now occupying a recognised and honourable\nposition as a therapeutic agent. This is shown by such papers as this by\nDr. Creed, and is a sign of the times.\nChas. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D.\nThe Effects of Mind on Body as Evidenced by Faith Cures. By Henry H.\nGoddard, A.M., Fellow in Psychology, Clark University. (The\nAmerican Journal of Psychology, Vol. X., No. 3 ; April, 1899, pp.\n431-502.)\nThe author here presents \"a brief survey of the field, that portion of\nthe data which is of most psychological interest, and some of the con\nclusions, from an extended study of mental therapeutics. We hope to\npresent in a later publication an extended report of all the work referred\nto.\" The material was gathered through answers to a syllabus, personal\ninterviews and investigations with various \"healers \" and their patients, and\nfrom the literature of the various sects, \u2014for the author uses \" Faith Cures \"\nas comprehending the various forms of distinctive suggestion treatment.\nChristian Scientists are largely considered, including a sketch of their\nleader, Mrs. Eddy ; \"Divine Healers\" are followed up in the large move\nment of Dr. Dowie, of Chicago, and the itinerant Schlatter ; and \" Mental\nScience \" as the most reasonable form, through its founder, Dr. Quimby.\nThe author's \"result of this investigation, extending over more than two\nyears, is the absolute conviction based upon experience, only one or two\nitems of which we can give here, that the curative principle in every one of\nthe forms is found in the influence of the mind of the patient on his body.\nIn other words, however different the claims and the method, the explana\ntion of all is the same.\" These religious forms of suggestion are then\ncompared with cases in the practice of regular physicians and in hypnotism.\nAfter a review of the failures and limitations of the faith cures, the con\nclusion is that their \"greatest field is in the realm of prevention\" (p. 499),\nand that \"suggestive therapeutics must take its place by the side of drugs\nrather than to assume to supersede them.\" (p. 488.) The concluding\npsychological discussion is extremely valuable. Thus the whole article is\nthe most timely, interesting and able study that has appeared in this fruit\nful field since Dr. and Mr. Myers's Mind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles\nof Lourdes (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IX., p. 160), which the present study\nhas unfortunately not mentioned, together with the several other studies on\nthis subject in the Proceedings S.P.

(Paris, Schleicher Freres.)\nL'Anne'e Psychologique for 1899 is an even more striking monument of\nscientific diligence and fecundity than the previous volumes have been.\nThe contributors of important articles, besides those by MM. Binet and\ni '\n\f106 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nHenri, are perhaps this year more numerous than usual. But the amount\nof work done by these two savants,\u2014the Editor and the Secretaire de\nRedaction,\u2014 in the way both of original experiment and of accurate and\ncritical analysis of the work of others\u2014seems rather to increase than to\ndiminish. Most strongly must it be said that the volume is an indispensable\naid to any student of Psychology.\nYet although this may be truly affirmed, it is only fair to add that in\nsome cases the subjects of research seem scarcely of sufficient importance\nto occupy for long the attention of scientific minds. The elaborate Biblio\ngraphy contains the titles of 2,558 books or articles connected with\nPsychology which appeared in 1898. This list represents a great mass of\nintellectual effort, from which, perhaps, fewer leading ideas have in fact\nemerged than might have been hoped in an age where really illuminating\ngeneralisations in science are wont to be so promptly pursued.\nThere are two papers, both of them from M. Binet's indefatigable pen,\nwhich bear on subjects which have been discussed in these Proceedings : one\nis on Suggestibility, one on \"L'illusion de fausse reconnaissance,\" for which\nI have elsewhere suggested the name Promnesia. To speak frankly, both\nthese papers seem to me to illustrate a tendency which runs through all\nthis mass of work,\u2014a tendency to treat the easy parts of the subject with\ncompleteness and mastery, and to ignore altogether those diffictdt parts\nwhich we in these Proceedings do make honest, if not always convincing,\nefforts to explain. Thus, the article on Suggestibility sets forth clearly and\ningeniously a number of causes which predispose to the supraliminal recep\ntion of suggestion ; but it scarcely even touches on the profounder puzzles\nof their subliminal reception,\u2014apart from the conscious knowledge of the\nsubject, and beyond the domain of his conscious will.\nCharacteristically enough, we find in the course of this article a long\nanalysis of an everyday experiment of Professor Patrick's in automatic\nscript, but of Mrs. Piper's trance-writings\u2014from which that very paper of\nProfessor Patrick's takes its rise\u2014not a word. The easy thing is additionally\nexplained ; the difficult problem\u2014Dr. Hodgson's Report \u2014remains as item\n1,249 in the Bibliography without further notice.\nWith the article on the deja vu\u2014paramnesia or promnesia\u2014the case is\nsomewhat similar. The conclusion reached on p. 742 is merely the obvious\ncommon-sense one which explains most of the recorded phenomena\u2014but\nnot all. \" The memory which is renewed has made a part of another con\nscious state\u2014call it A\u2014at the moment when it was stored up in the mind,\nwhereas the subject, when he recalls the memory, is in conscious state B.\nOn account of the analogy between the two states, the earlier perception A\nbecomes fused into the actual perception B ;\u2014the two syntheses are brought\nthus into a sort of collision. The Group A tends more or less to reconstitute\nitself, in spite of the antagonism of the Group B ; there is a struggle, a\ncompetition, between two different conscious states, resulting in a dis\ntressing sense of duplication, of loss of personality. One feels oneself\nchanged and no longer the same, because the forgotten Group A recovers\nactivity and tries to supplant the actual Group B.\"\nM. Binet does not claim originality, except of expression, for this\nexplanation, which is, in fact, obviously sufficient for the commoner cases.\n\fPartxxxvL] Review. 107\n\"We may lay aside,\" he says, \"the hypothesis of cerebral duality due\nto Wigan, and that of telepathy due to Lalande ;\u2014this latter hypothesis,\nm fact, is so extraordinary (tellement bizarre) that one cannot understand\nhow it can have been put forward in our times.\" (Let readers who do\nnot think it worth while to send us fresh evidence for telepathy, because\nthey suppose that every one admits it, note that last phrase !)\nWell, it may be that neither telepathy nor cerebral duality in any form\nis really needed here ;\u2014but if M. Binet wishes to make certain of this,\nhe should first manage to dispose in some way or other of some of the most\nremarkable of the cases which he himself cites. If, for example, J. H.,\nthe military doctor, did in truth repeat phrases from Ferdinand le Noceur,\nbefore they were uttered by the actors,\u2014as Lalande tells us, \u2014what is M.\nBinet's explanation for that 1\nI certainly cannot complain if M. Binet, with all he has to read, has\nnot read pp. 340-347 of Vol. IX. of the S.P.R. Proceedings. Nor can\nI expect that anything which I have there advanced is at all a final solution\nof these puzzles. Nevertheless, our psychology is hardly yet so profound\nthat it suffices to set forth with clarity ingenious deductions from what we\nalready know. The history of far less complex studies should teach us that\nit is dangerous to assume too soon that any given science has for us no more\n8urprise8- F. W. H.

Psychical Research is no longer felt to need the recommendation'\nof names independently eminent in other branches of study.\n2. Yet if recognition is to be paid primarily to actual work per\nformed for our Research, the name of Edmund Gurney must occur as\nthat which all would fain have honoured ;\u2014the man whose attitude\ntowards our Research was of the loftiest, the most unselfish kind ; the\nman who felt most strongly the sheer moral need of discovering a\nfuture life, if the cruel injustices of this life are to be conceived as\ncompatible with a First Cause worthy of love or worship.\n3. For most men the quest of immortality will answer to a stronger\nelement of personal desire ;\u2014although such desire need not imply bias\nin the estimation of evidence.\n4. No attachment to Christian tradition, no recognition of the need\nand value of high intuitions, should blind us to the fact that only on\ntruths scientifically demonstrated can a world-philosophy or world-\nreligion be based.\n5. Yet the facts proved by Science have not thus far been adequate\nto satisfy the spiritual needs of mankind. May not Science discover-\nfurther facts which may at any rate prove the preamble of all religions ?\n6. Such is our attempt ;\u2014for we believe that by maintaining unity of\nmethod in our search for every form of truth we have the best chance\nof discovering new facts of deep spiritual importance.\n7. And, in fact, this line of inquiry has already pointed us to a\nhidden, subliminal world within us,\u2014and through that world to an un\nseen, but responsive, spiritual world without.\n8. And if the messages from that unseen world be felt at present\nto be inadequate to our desires, yet our faith in the coherence and\nintelligibility of at least the material universe should lead us to trust\nthat clarity and dignity cannot be permanently lacking in any system\nof communications which may proceed from the Universe of Spirit.\n9. We seem, indeed, to be awakening into a new consciousness\nof the living solidarity of the human race, in this world and the\n\fxxxvii.] Presidential Address. Ill\nnext, which will afford an adequate motive for utmost effort and\nhighest hope.\n10. But if we are thus to gain the advantage of scientific certainty\nfor our deepest beliefs, we are bound in return to treat the scientific\nvirtues as necessary to salvation.\n11. The especial function of the Society for Psychical Research\nshould be to insist upon this view, and to form an advisory centre for\nwidespread investigation.\n12. For aid in this task we can address our claim alike to the\nscientific and to the religious world ; our wider Science, of which\nReligion is the subjective aspect, must come not to destroy, but to\nfulfil.\n1. When I heard, in absence from England, that the Council of\nthis Society had done me the honour of electing me as its President for\nthe current year, I felt that a certain definite stage in the Society's\nevolution had been reached at an earlier date than I should originally\nhave expected.\nMy predecessors in this Chair, I need not say, have, without excep\ntion, been men of the highest distinction. The list has included men\nwhose leadership would confer honour on any body of men whatever ;- -\non such bodies, for instance, as the British Association or the House of\nCommons. We have been grateful to these eminent persons for lending\nthe sanction of their names to our early beginnings. And we have other\nnames in reserve of similar distinction ;\u2014destined, I hope, some day to\nadorn our list of Presidents. Yet for the current year the Council\nhave preferred to choose a man who has little claim to such a dis\ntinction, beyond the fact that he has worked for the objects which\nour Society seeks, from days even before the Society's formation ;\u2014\nand that he is determined to go on thus working so long as his\nfaculties may allow. So have our friends chosen ; and if a man may\nspeak thus of his own election, I think that the choice is appropriate\nenough. For the time has come when we may fairly indicate to the\nworld that we believe our Society can stand on its own bottom ; that\nit carries on a branch of scientific work which, although novel and\ntentative, is legitimate and honourable ; and therefore that we do\nnot need to put forward in its prominent positions only those names\nwhich have been made independently illustrious by good work of other\nkinds performed elsewhere. As representing the principle that the\nplain, unadorned Psychical Researcher is just as respectable in his own\nway as anybody else, I am proud indeed to see my humbler name\ninscribed after the names of Henry Sidgwick, Balfour Stewart, Arthur\nBalfour, William James, and William Crookes.\nL\n\f112 F. W. H. Myers. [pakt\n2. But here one thought must rise ;\u2014must rise for all who knew the\nearly days of this research, but most of all for me ;\u2014-Would that\nEdmund Gurney were standing where I stand now ! For us who knew\nhim best the years since he left us have but served to illustrate his\nuniqueness and to deepen his memory ;\u2014have made us feel how much\nof the humorous adventure, the sympathetic fellowship, the deep delight\nof this research of ours has with him passed irrevocably away. On\nthe lighter side of things, we can never renew the intellectual enjoy\nment of those years of our small beginnings spent at his side ;\u2014watch\ning how his flashing irony, his fearless dialectic, dealt with the attacks\nwhich then poured in from every quarter ;\u2014with the floundering\nplatitudes of obscurantist orthodoxy, or with the smug sneers of popular\nscience, belittling what it will not try to understand. On the graver\nside, we shall hardly see another example of just that attitude of mind\nwith which Gurney entered on this research,\u2014and which made for us\nso deep an element in his incomparable charm.\nFor in that many-chorded nature sympathy was the deepest strain ;\u2014\nsympathy which flowed forth indeed to those he loved in such penetrat\ning and intimate tenderness as few mortals have had the happiness to\nknow,\u2014but which expended itself more widely in a profound compas\nsion for the multiform sorrows of men. And thus, as needs must\nhappen in those responsive minds which hear, in the Apostle's words,\nthe whole creation groaning and travailing until now, there came to\nhim the conviction that the question of life after death was the only\ntest which we could really apply to the existence of a Providence ;\u2014\nnay, that it was no mere articulus stantis aut cadentis Ecclesue, but in\nsombre earnest, for all humankind, the articulus stantis aut cadentis\nDei. Strangely enough, it was for others rather than for himself that\nGurney desired this great possibility ; his own mournful and stoic\ntemper dwelt little on any personal hope. But he felt that if the First\nCause has summoned into life on earth, though it were but one single\nman alone, miserable amid all the happy;\u2014one single soul foredoomed to\neternal protest and inescapable woe ;\u2014then that First Cause is not a God\nto whom a good man can offer love, or a just man worship. Alas ! how\nmany theologies does this clear moral axiom shrivel as with burning fire !\nhow many philosophies does it scatter to the winds !\u2014philosophies of\nmen walking delicately on wordy bridges across the grim abyss of things,\n\u2014satisfied that the world is well enough, while round them wronged,\ndegraded lives by millions are perishing in agony and for ever. It was\nin response to such easy optimism that Gurney's logic was the most\nintolerably trenchant, his sombre silence the fullest of sad scorn ;\u2014\nfor in truth this contented blindness of sealed spirits is in itself the\nvilest woe of man. He could not avert his eyes, and disport himself\nin a fool's Paradise. He could not weave a web of words, and stifle\n\fxxxvu.] Presidential Address. 113\nin a philosopher's dream. Suffer me to apply to my friend for a\nmoment even those lofty lines in which a great poet has invoked the\ngreatest :\u2014\n\"Thou that seest universal Nature moved hy universal Mind ;\nThou, majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of humankind.\"\n3. It is well that this noble figure should stand at the entrance of\nour research ;\u2014should show how unselfish may be the impulse which\nhas prompted to eager labour,\u2014eager even beyond the limit which\nphysical powers allowed. But assuredly the mass of us Psychical\nResearchers have no need whatever of heroic virtue. We have enough\nand to spare of such motives as appeal to ordinary men. We have the\nstimulus of intellectual curiosity,\u2014more richly satisfied, I think, in ours\nthan in any other quest ;\u2014and beyond this most of us, I think, have the\nhealthful, primary desire for the prolongation\u2014the endless prolongation\n\u2014of life and happiness. I know, indeed, that for various reasons some men\nof strong and high nature, as well as many men of feebler nature, do fail\nto feel this desire; but on the whole one must regard that form of Wdt-\nSchrwrz as but a passing mood of our race's immaturity,\u2014as what\nphysicians call a neurosis of development ;\u2014one must admit that usually\nwhen a man cares little for existence this is because existence cares\nlittle for him, and that it has been doubt as to the value of life and love\nwhich has made the decadence of almost all civilisations. Life is the\nfinal aim of life ; the mission of the highest Teacher was that we\nmight have it the more abundantly ; and the universe strives best\ntowards its ultimate purpose through the normal, vigorous spirit to\nwhom to live itself is joy.\nThe danger, then, for our research will lie not in lack but in excess\nof motive ; our minds may be biassed in their judgment of evidence by\na deep instinctive desire. For my own part, I certainly cannot claim\nsuch impartiality as indifference might bring. From my earliest child\nhood\u2014from my very first recollections\u2014the desire for eternal life has\nimmeasurably eclipsed for me every other wish or hope. Yet desire is\nnot necessarily bias ; and my personal history has convinced myself\u2014\nthough I cannot claim that it shall convince others also\u2014that my\nwishes do not strongly warp my judgment,\u2014nay, that sometimes the\nvery keenness of personal anxiety may make one afraid to believe, as\nreadily as other men, that which one most longs for.\nFor when, after deriving much happiness from Christian faith, I felt\nmyself forced by growing knowledge to recognise that the evidence for\nthat culminant instance of spirit return was not adequate, as standing\nalone, to justify conviction, I did honestly surrender that great joy ;\nalthough its loss was more grievous to me than anything else which has\nhappened to me in life.\nl 2\n\f114 F. W. H. Myers. [part\nThen with little hope\u2014nay, almost with reluctant scorn\u2014but with\nthe feeling that no last and least chance of the great discovery should\nbe thrown aside, I turned to such poor efforts at psychical research as\nwere at that time possible ; and now it is only after thirty years of\nsuch study as I have been able to give that I say to myself at last,\nJIabes totd quod mente petisti\u2014\"Thou hast what thine whole heart\ndesired ; \"\u2014that I recognise that for me this fresh evidence,\u2014while\nraising that great historic incident of the Resurrection into new\ncredibility,\u2014has also filled me with a sense of insight and of thankful\nness such as even my first ardent Christianity did not bestow.\nYet if I thus find the happiness which sprang from far-reaching\nTradition and Intuition surpassed by the happiness which springs from\na narrower, but a more stable range of demonstrated fact, I nevertheless\nspeak in no spirit of reaction or of ingratitude towards traditions and\nintuitions which must yet, for many a century, be potent for the\nsalvation of men. I by no means take for granted that any\nscientific inquiry, any induction from empirical facts, can afford\nto man his only or his deepest insight into the meaning of\nthe Universe. I have no controversy with those who say that\ncontemplation, revelation, ecstasy, may carry deep into certain\nhearts an even profounder truth. I recognise also that our Science is\na conventional structure ; that it rests on assumptions which we cannot\nfully prove ; or which even indicate, by their apparent inconsistency,\nthat they can be at best but narrow aspects of some underlying\nlaw imperfectly discerned. All this we may all admit ; just as we\nadmit the inadequacy, the conventionality, of human speech itself.\nSpeech cannot match the meaning which looks in an hour of emotion\nfrom the eyes of a friend. But what we learn from that gaze is\nindefinable and incommunicable. Our race needed the spoken and\nwritten word, with all its baldness, if they were to understand each\nother and to grow to be men. So with Science as opposed to Intuition\nScience forms a language common to all mankind ; she can explain\nherself when she is misunderstood and right herself when she goes\nwrong ; nor has humanity yet found, at any rate, since that great\nwedding between Reason and Experience, which immortalises the name\nof Galileo,\u2014that the methods of Science, intelligently and honestly\nfollowed, have led us in the end astray.\nIt is only in the region of inquiry into a spiritual world\u2014I mean a\nworld of immaterial and yet individual realities\u2014that these truisms are\nstill in danger of being taken for paradoxes. At once the intimate\ninterest and the extreme obscurity of that investigation have long\nprevented it from being kept fully and fairly in that scientific field\nwhere man's attempts at all other knowledge are now collected and\nappraised. In their rude beginnings, no doubt, Religion and Science\n\fxxxvii ] Presidential Address. 115\nwere indistinguishable. The savage observed such scanty facts as he\ncould get at, and tried to shape both his practical and his spiritual life\nupon that observation. But his need of a theory of the unseen world\n(to put his vague hopes and terrors into our own phraseology) went far\nbeyond what his scraps of experience could teach him. \" What must\n1 do to be saved 1 \" was a question to which he could not find, yet\nwould not wait for an answer. He fell into grotesque fancies, which\nhis experience did not really support ; and the divorce of Religion from\nScience at once began.\nThe spiritual need which thus acted on the savage continues to act\non the civilised man. He too is impelled to build his faith on grounds\noutside his sphere of observation, to enlarge the safe, general, and per\nmanent formula for religion in various more or less unsafe, specialised,\nand transitory ways. For it is\u2014may one not say 1\u2014a safe, general, and\npermanent formula for religion if we regard it as man's normal sub\njective response to the sum of known cosmic phenomena taken as an\nintelligible whole. Under the title of Natural Religion this forms\nat least an element in all the higher forms of faith. Nevertheless it is\nfelt to be inadequate ; because the observable phenomena of the\nUniverse, so far at least as they have yet been observed, have not been\nsuch as to evoke (save in some few minds) the full hope, the full\ndevotion which our developed nature yearns to feel. To live by\nNatural Religion alone has been like living on turnips in the field.\nMost men demand their spiritual nutriment in a more assimilable form.\nThe philosophical or the poetical contemplation of Nature has not\nsatisfied them in the past ; nor can they hope that the scientific con\ntemplation of Nature will satisfy them any better now. They turn\naside from the ambiguous pageant, the circumspect scrutiny ; they\nspecialise the name of Religion upon some clear, swift, extra-scientific\nknowledge as to the dealings of unseen Powers with mankind.\nOn such knowledge, or supposed knowledge, the peoples of East and\nWest have stayed in many fashions their soul's desire ; but, neverthe\nless, we all know too well that even yet there is no spiritual food\nattainable in the precise condition in which it will meet all healthy\nneeds. We are all forced to feel that in the present divided and un\nstable condition of beliefs there is plausibility in the Agnostic's appeal\nto us to halt and mark time ; in his insistence that we have not really\nevidence, up to modern standards, which can support any definite creed\nin matters remote from ordinary methods of proof. Some men, indeed,\nhave ventured explicitly to reply that Christian Faith need not be\nfounded on the same kind of demonstration as Science ; that Tradition\nand Intuition can well supply her outward form and her inward glow.\nUrged among those who have much of consecrated tradition, of noble\nintuition in common, this high claim may seem convincing as the gaze\n\f116 F.W.H. Myers. [part\nof a friend. But it has the inevitable weakness already indicated.\nIntroduce other persons of different race but equally sincere, the\nBuddhist, the Parsee, the Jew\u2014nay, the saint of science, like Darwin\n\u2014and you can meet these men no longer on the ground of Christian\nTradition or Intuition\u2014you can meet them on the ground of Science\nalone. Thus even among spiritually-minded men we seem forced back\ninto the view that Science can be the only world-philosophy or world-\nreligion ; \u2014the only synthesis of the Universe which, however imperfect,\nis believed in semper, ubique, et ab omnibus, by all who can under\nstand it.\n5. This conclusion, however, as already implied, at present satisfies\nnobody. The Christian says that it is mere mockery to pretend that\nScience can be the base of Religion ; for it tells us nothing of the\nspiritual world. \" Naturally,\" replies the Agnostic, hardening into\nMaterialism; \"since there is no spiritual world of which to tell.\"\n\" The Universe,\" cried Clifford triumphantly, \" is made of ether and\natoms, and there is no room for ghosts.\"\nSo soon, however, as the man of science takes this tone\u2014so soon as\nhe passes, so to say, from Huxley to Clifford\u2014he loses his strong\nposition, the Agnostic's raison d'etre. Clifford had not really turned\nover his atoms thoroughly enough to make sure that no ghost was\nhidden among them. As indisputably as any worshipper of Mumbo-\nJumbo had that eager truth-lover framed an emotional synthesis which\noutran his Science.\nIs, then, the passivity of pure Agnosticism the attitude with which\nwe ought to be content I Ignoramus et ignorabimus\u2014should this be\nthe single clause of our creed ? Surely that were too tame a surrender\nto the Sphinx and her riddle ; which, in the old story, turned out after\nall to be rather easy to guess. Why should we not simply try to find\nout new facts here, as we have found out new facts everywhere else\nwhere we have looked for them 1 Just here we have not looked for\nthem yet, because neither the priests of our religions nor their critics\nhave till now been disposed for the quest. The priests have thought it\nsafest to defend their own traditions, their own intuitions, without going\nafield in search of independent evidence of a spiritual world. Their\nassailants have kept their powder and shot for the orthodox ramparts,\nignoring any isolated strongholds which formed no part of the main\nline of defence.\nThis search for new facts is precisely what our Society undertakes.\nStarting from various standpoints, we endeavour to carry the newer,\nthe intellectual virtues into regions where dispassionate tranquillity has\nseldom yet been known. As compared with the claims of Theologians,\nwe set before ourselves a humbler, yet a difficult task. We do not seek\nto shape the clauses of the great Act of Faith, but merely to prove its\n\fxxxvn.] Presidential Address. 117\npreamble. To prove the preamble of all religions; to be able to say to\ntheologian or to philosopher : \" Thus and thus we demonstrate that a\nspiritual world exists\u2014a world of independent and abiding realities,\nnot a mere ' epiphenomenon ' or transitory effect of the material\nworld\u2014a world of things, concrete and living, not a mere system of\nabstract ideas ;\u2014now, therefore, reason on that world or feel towards it\nas you will.\" This would indeed, in my view, be the weightiest service\nwhich any research could render to the deep disquiet of our time ;\u2014\nnay, to the dexklerium orbis catholici, the world-old and world-wide\ndesire.\n6. First, then, we adopt the ancient belief\u2014implied in all mono\ntheistic religion, and conspicuously confirmed by the progress of modern\nscience\u2014that the world as a whole, spiritual and material together, has\nin some way a systematic unity ; and on this we base the novel pre\nsumption that there should be a unity of method in the investigation of\nall fact. We hold therefore that the attitude, the habits of mind, the\nmethods, by aid of which physical science has grown deep and wide,\nshould be applied also to the spiritual world. We endeavour to\napproach the problems of that world by careful collection, scrutiny,\ntesting, of particular facts ; and we account no unexplained fact too\ntrivial for our attention. Seeking knowledge before edification, we aim\nnot at what we should most like to learn, but at what we have the best\nchance of learning ; we dabble among beggarly elements ; we begin at\nthe beginning.\nInto this frame of mind the long habit of our race in matters\nreligious has made it difficult fully to enter. I have found it helpful\nto imagine what would be the procedure of some extraneous inquirer\ninto the nature and fate of men\u2014some inquirer exempt from their\nhopes, their fears, their presuppositions.\nLet us suppose, then, that \"a spectator of all time and all existence,\"\na kind of minor Cosmotheorus, as Plato might call him, were speculating\nfrom the standpoint of this planet, as to what was likely to be the true\nposition of the human race in the scheme of the Universe. Such an\nohserver would be compelled to start from the facts before him. He\nwould begin his investigation, therefore, not with God but with man.\nHe would analyse the faculties of which he found man possessed, and\nwould infer in what environment they were designed to operate\u2014of\nwhat system, that is to say, of cosmic laws, expressing a special\nmodification of the ultimate energy, the energy contained in the human\nrace formed an integral element. His first discovery would be that the\nobvious material environment, which is all that most men know, does\nnot exhaust the faculties nor cover the phenomena of human life.\nMost of man's senses, indeed, he could explain as concerned solely\nwith matter. Sight he could not thus explain ; and the study\n\f118 F. W. H. Myers. [part\nof light would lead him to discover the etherial environment\u2014a system\nof laws, that is to say, which, while fundamentally continuous with the\nlaws of matter, doas yet supply a new conception of the Cosmos, at\nonce more generalised and more profound. But still the central\nproblem of man's being would remain unsolved. Life and thought\ncould not be referred to the working either of aggregated molecules or\nof etherial undulations. To explain Life by these two environ\nments would be as impossible as it had been to explain Light by\nthe material environment alone. Might there not be yet another\nenvironment\u2014metetherial, spiritual, what you will ? Was there any\nway of reducing this vast and vague problem of Life to manageable\ndefiniteness \\ Were there measurable traces of human faculty working\nin apparent independence of material or etherial law ? Such traces, if\nhe sought long enough, I maintain that he would assuredly find. He\nwould find (as we have found) instances of telassthesia, or perception\nbeyond the sensory range ; instances of telepathy, or direct communica\ntion from mind to mind ;\u2014nay, telepathic messages from the so-called\ndead\u2014signs and apparitions by which minds discarnate impressed them\nselves upon minds still robed in flesh. How far the ether, in some of\nits unknown properties, may be concerned in these operations, our\nCosmotheorus might be better able to guess than we. To him, perhaps,\nno environment would seem discontinuous with any other environment.\nBut, at any rate, here would be definite traces of a new environment\nof Life and Thought ; traces of the mutual action of minds, embodied\nand unembodied, in apparent independence of matter.\nI must not here follow our imagined inquirer further ; but surely\nwe leave him launched upon a series of observations and experiments\nwhich have no inherent flaw in their basis, and no assignable limit to\ntheir scope.\n7. I have dwelt at some length upon this line of argument, because\nI think that, in some form or other, it is our duty to have it always\nforthcoming, our duty to set it before the world in varying expression,\nuntil our age is really convinced that this great branch of knowledge,\nwhich deals with things unseen, can form no exception to those rules bv\nwhich experience shows us that all valid knowledge has hitherto been\nwon. So confident, indeed, do I feel in this gradual but certain\nmethod of approach\u2014in this open, unfrequented way\u2014that even if it\nhad thus far failed to lead us to any discovery, I should feel bound to\npursue it still. But it has not failed. This persistent analysis of un\nexplored faculty has revealed to us already far more than I, for one,\nhad ever dared to hope. I may surely say with no more than the\nlicensed exaggeration of epigram, that our method has revealed to us a\nhidden world within us, and that this hidden world within us has re\nvealed to us an invisible world without.\n\fxxxvii.] Presidential Address. 119\nWithin each man, I say, there is a world of thought and of percep\ntion which lies outside the margin, beneath the threshold, deeper than\nthe surface-tension of his conscious being.\n\" We were the first that ever burst\nInto that silent sea.\"\nWe at any rate were among the earliest to attempt to explore and\nmap out that strange, submerged region\u2014half lumber-room and half\nking's-treasury\u2014where amid things outworn lie things unborn, and\npossibilities of our unimaginable Future lurk among the exuviae of our\nimmemorable Past. And yet in this confusion all is implicitly con\ngruous and consecutive ; each trace of faculty, whether it lie behind\nour actual stage of progress or before, belongs to a series of develop\nments of personality whose terms have no assignable limit ;\u2014a series\nwhich carries us onward without a break, from dream and hallucina\ntion and bewilderment, up to the utterances of discarnate spirits and\nthe visions of ecstasy.\nFor, in truth, from the mind's inward vision we may learn more\nthan from the seeing of the eye ; from inward audition more than\nfrom the hearing of the ear. The automatisms which steal their way\nupward from hidden depths to manifestation amid man's sensory per\nceptions and voluntary acts are found on analysis to contain elements\nof knowledge not attainable in any normal fashion. Such knowledge\nis shown in telepathic messages between living men, and in apparitions\nwhich tell of men dying, and in evidential messages from men whom\nwe call dead. All this \u2014in Phanto&ms of the Living and in fourteen\nvolumes of Proceedings\u2014I claim that we have adequately shown.\nAnd of late years we have advanced and consolidated these frag\nmentary and fugitive indications of the spirit's survival by certain\nrecords of trance-phenomena and spirit-possession ;\u2014records as yet\ninchoate and imperfect, yet which must needs be faced and dealt\nwith by all serious men.\n8. But here I must needs stay a moment to prevent any misunder\nstanding. Throughout this address, of course, I am speaking for myself\nalone. I am not giving utterance to any collective view, but to my own\nview of the general drift and result of our collective action. But at\nthis point I know that most even of those who may have gone with me\nthus far will,\u2014and quite justifiably,\u2014suspend their adhesion. Few\neven of my own colleagues have had full reason to believe that matter\nof real importance has yet been received from behind the veil, and in\nthe world at large the general impression that even those messages\nwhich look evidentially as though they had come from discarnate spirits\nare yet practically futile and incoherent is strongly and naturally\noperative in checking public interest in what seems so strangely baffling\na research.\n\f120 F. W. H. Myers. [part\nI will not now protest, as I might protest, against the accuracy of\nthis general impression of the actual facts. Accepting it for the sake\nof argument, I will confine myself to one simple line of a priori reason\ning, which seems to me sufficient to show what, in the supposed case, is\nour plain, scientific duty. I say, then, that if once it be admitted,\n\u2014as we are now assuming, for argument's sake, that it is admitted\u2014\nthat it is evidentially probahle that some of these messages do indeed,\nin however indirect or confused a manner, emanate from an unseen\nworld,\u2014then it is a blasphemy against the faith of Science to doubt\nthat they must ultimately prove to be of serious, of supreme\nimportance.\nThe faith to which Science is sworn is a faith in the uniformity, the\ncoherence, the intelligibility of, at any rate, the material universe.\nScience herself is but the practical development of this mighty\npostulate. And if any phenomenon on which she chances on her onward\nway seems arbitrary, or incoherent, or unintelligible, she does not\ntherefore suppose that she has come upon an unravelled end in the\ntexture of things ; but rather takes for granted that a rational answer\nto the new problem must somewhere exist,\u2014an answer which will be all\nthe more instructive because it will involve facts of which that first\nquestion must have failed to take due account.\nThis faith in the uniformity of material Nature formulates itself in\ntwo great dogmas\u2014for such they are ;\u2014the dogma of the Conservation\nof Matter, and the dogma of the Conservation of Energy. Of the\nConservation of Matter, within earthly limits, we are fairly well\nassured ; but of the Conservation of Energy the proof is far less com\nplete, simply because Energy is a conception which does not belong to\nthe material world alone. Life is to us the most important of all\nforms of activity ;\u2014of energy, I would say,\u2014except that we cannot\ntransform other energies into Life, nor measure in foot-pounds that\ndirective force which has changed the face of the world. Life comes\nwe know not whence ; it vanishes we know not whither ; it is inter\nlocked with a moving system vaster than that we know. To grasp the\nwhole of its manifestation we should have to follow it into an unseen\nworld. Yet scientific faith bids us believe that there, too, there is\ncontinuity ; and that the past and the future of that force which\nwe discern for a moment are still subject to universal Law.\nBelieving, then, that the whole Cosmos is such as to satisfy the\nclaims of human Reason, we are irresistibly led to ask whether it\nsatisfies other claims of our nature which are as imperious as Reason\nitself. Infinite Intelligence would see the Cosmos as infinitely in\ntelligent ; but would infinite Goodness also see it as infinitely good ?\nWe know too well the standing difficulties in the way of such an\nassumption. They are that which we call Evil, and that which we\n\fxxxvii.] Presidential Address. 121\nsee as Death. Now as to Evil,\u2014which for us here and now seems so\nineffaceable a blot on the idea of Omnipotence,\u2014we can perhaps never\ntheless just conceive that for the Cosmotheorus all these defects and\nincompatibilities of human impulse and sensibility may seem as\nrelatively infinitesimal in the unimaginable Sum of Things, as for\nus are the whirl and clashing of molecules in the dewdrop, which\ncannot mar for our vision its crystalline calm.\nBut death, as it presents itself to us, cannot be similarly explained\naway. If it be really, as it seems, a sheer truncation of moral\nprogress, absolute alike for the individual and for the race,\u2014then\nany human conception of a moral universe must simply be given\nup. We are shut in land-locked pools ; why speak to us of an in\nfinite sea 1\nWhat, then, should be the impulse, what the faith of Science, if she\nfinds even the least reason to suspect that this truncation is in fact\nillusory ; that on the moral side also there is conservation and persist\nence ;\u2014conservation not only of such ether-vortices as we assume to\nunderlie our visible matter, but of the spiritual systems or syntheses\nwhich underlie the personalities of men!\u2014persistence not only of crude\ntransformable energies, but of those specific non-transformable energies\nwhich inform a Plato or a Newton, and which seem the only com\nmensurate object towards which the whole process of evolution can\ntend 1 Surely in such a case, whatever dreaminess or confusion may\nmark the opening of intercourse with worlds indefinitely remote,\nScience should summon all her fundamental trust in the coherence,\nthe intelligibility of things, to assure her that the dreaminess must pass\nand the confusion clear, and that the veriest rudiment of communica\ntion I)etween world and world bears yet the promise of completing and\nconsummating her own mighty dogmas,\u2014of effecting a unification of the\nuniverse such as she has never ventured to hope till now 1 What are\nour petty human preconceptions worth in such a case as this 1 If it\nwas absurd to refuse to listen to Kepler, because he bade the planets\nmove in no perfect circles, but in undignified ellipses ;\u2014because he\nhastened and slackened from hour to hour what ought to be a heavenly\nbody's ideal and unwavering speed ;\u2014is it not absurder still to refuse\nto listen to these voices from afar, because they come stammering and\nwandering as in a dream confusedly, instead of with a trumpet's call ?\nbecause spirits that bend nigh to earth may undergo, perhaps, an\nearthly bewilderment, and suffer unknown limitations, and half remem\nber us and half forget 1\nNay ! in the end it is not for us to choose ;\u2014we needs must join in\nthis communion with what grace we may. We cannot, if we would,\ntransform ourselves into the mere cynical spectators of an irrational\nuniverse. We are part and parcel of these incredible phenomena ; our\n\f122 F. W. H. Myers.

Let us try, then,\nwhether a more serious response on our part may enable the senders of\nthe messages to speak with clearer voice. To whose care indeed has such\nresponse been hitherto for the most part left ? May not the instances\nwhere adequate precautions have been taken, adequate record made, be\ncounted on the fingers of one hand 1 Might not our unseen corre\nspondents turn the tables on us when we complain of their incapacity, and\nask whether it was worth while to do better for the \"domestic muffs\" of\nMme. Blavatsky's far-famed ce'nacle, or for the sitters at the \"materiali\nsation seances \" of the \" Vampires of Onset \" ?\nAssuredly we modern men have taken, in other quarters, more\ntrouble than here is needed, with far less hope of reward. What has\ngiven its worth to the study of comparative religions except our steady\neffort to comprehend and to co-ordinate such childish and stammering\nutterances as have marked the rise in one nation after another of those\n\u2022spiritual needs and conceptions which make in the end the truest unity\nof the race of man 1 What should we have learnt from the Vedas,\nfrom the Book of the Dead \u2014nay, from the Christian records them\nselves\u2014had we approached those sacred texts in the spirit alternately\nof Simple Simon and of Voltaire 1\n9. The time, I think, is ripe for a generalisation wider than any\nwhich those ancient books contain. For just as a kind of spiritual\nfusion of Europe under Roman sway prepared the way for Christianity\nto become the European religion, so now also it seems to me that a\ngrowing conception of the unity, the solidarity, of the human race is\npreparing the way for a world-religion which expresses and rests upon\nthat solidarity ;\u2014which conceives it in a fuller, more vital fashion than\neither Positivist or Catholic had ever dreamed. For the new conception\nis neither of henefactors dead and done for, inspiring us automatically\nfrom their dates in an almanac, nor of shadowy saints imagined to\nintercede for us at Tribunals more shadowy still ;\u2014but rather of a\nhuman unity, \u2014close-linked beneath an unknown Sway,\u2014wherein every\nman who hath been or now is makes a living element ; \u2014inalienably\nincorporate, and imperishably co-operant, and joint-inheritor of one\ninfinite Hope.\nOf course, I am not here supposing that any human gaze can pierce\ndeeply into the world unseen. Such communion as we may hold with\nspirits in any degree comparable with ourselves must needs be on a\nlevel far beneath the lowest of \" Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms,\n\fxxxvii.] Presidential Address. 12$\nVirtues, Powers\";\u2014nay, must be in the very vestibule and antechamber\nof the outermost of the courts of Heaven. These souls of ours are but\ninfantum animasflentes in limine primo ;\u2014the first and humblest con\nscious links in a wonderful order ;\u2014trembling still and half-bewildered\nat a future vaster than we know. I do not presume to forecast what\nwe may come in time to learn ; I only say that for the present hour\nthere will be enough of motive to urge us to utmost effort to rise in the\nscale of being, if we can once be certain that such noble spirits as we\nhave known by earthly intercourse or earthly record do still concern\nthemselves with our progress, and still from their higher vantage-ground\ncall to us that all is well.\nMen objected of old to Copernicus that if our earth really swept\nround the sun in so vast an orbit, there should be an apparent displace\nment\u2014a parallax\u2014in the position of the fixed stars. Such parallax\nwas long sought in vain ; till at last advancing skill detected it in\nsome few stars nearer than the rest ;. and our relation to these near\nluminaries proved to us our veritable voyage through the star-strewn\ndeep. Perhaps in the spiritual world as well we have strained our gaze\ntoo exclusively on luminaries that are beyond the parallactic limit ;\nand eyes turned steadily on some nearer brightness may teach us at\nlast our kinship and community in the firmament of souls.\nNot, then, with tears and lamentations should we think of the\nblessed dead. Rather we should rejoice with them in their enfranchise\nment, and know that they are still minded to keep us as sharers in\ntheir joy. It is they, not we, who are working now ; they are more\nready to hear than we to pray ; they guide us as with a cloudy pillar,\nbut it is kindling into steadfast fire.\nNay, it may be that our response, our devotion, is a needful element\nin their ascending joy ; and God may have provided some better thing\nfor us, that they without us should not be made perfect ;\u2014v.1 non sine\nnobis consummarenlur.\n10. To most of my hearers I doubt not that this forecast of a coming\nco-operation between incarnate and discarnate spirits will have seemed\nspeculative and premature. My defence is that I believe that upon\nour own attitude towards these nascent communications their progress\nand development depend, so that we cannot too soon direct serious\nattention to the high responsibilities opening on our view. And now\nyet another practical question is ready, I think, for immediate discus\nsion. All great changes in speculative belief must modify in some\nway man's immediate duty. In what way must our idea of duty be\nmodified, be expanded, if a religion is offered to us which no longer\ndepends on tradition and intuition only, but on reason also and on\nexperiment; which is not locked away in an emotional compartment of\n\f124 F.

[part\nour being, nor adapted to the genius of special races alone, but is oecu\nmenical as Science is oecumenical, is evolutionary as Science is evolu\ntionary, and rests on a permanent and provable relationship of the\nwhole spiritual to the whole material world ?\nNo full answer to such a question can as yet be attempted or\ndivined. But one point is clear ;\u2014and on that point it is already\nurgently necessary to insist. We must maintain, in old theological\nlanguage, that the intellectual virtues have now become .necessary to\nxalvation. Curiosity, candour, care ;\u2014these are the intellectual\nvirtues; \u2014disinterested curiosity, unselfish candour, unremitting care.\nThese virtues have grown up outside the ecclesiastical pale ; Science,\nnot Religion, has fostered them ;\u2014nay, Religion has held them scarcely\nconsistent with that pious spirit which hopes to learn by humility\nand obedience the secrets of an unseen world. Here surely our new\nideals suggest not opposition but fusion. To us as truly as to monk\nor anchorite the spiritual world is an intimate, an interpenetrating\nreality. But its very reality suggests the need of analysis, the risk of\nmisinterpretation ; the very fact that we have outgrown our sacerdotal\nswaddling-clothes bids us learn to walk warily among pitfalls which\ncall for all the precautions which systematic reason can devise.\nUpon a new scheme of beliefs, attractive to the popular mind as the\nscheme which I prefigure, a swarm of follies and credulities must\ninevitably perch and settle. Yet let those who mock at the weaknesses\nof \" modern Spiritualism \" ask themselves to what extent either ortho\ndox religion or official science has been at pains to guard the popular\nmind against losing balance upon contact with new facts, profoundly\nbut obscurely significant t Have the people's religious instructors\ntrained them to investigate for themselves ?

In such a case ridicule is no\nremedy.

Now here, I take it, lies the special, the characteristic duty of\nthe Society for Psychical Research. It is a duty far wider than the mere\nexposure of fraud ; far wider than the mere production of specimens of\npatient and intelligent investigation. Our duty is not the founding of\na new sect, nor even the establishment of a new science, but is rather\nthe expansion of Science herself until she can satisfy those questions\nwhich the human heart will rightly ask, but to which Religion alone has\nthus far attempted an answer. Or rather, this is the duty, the mission, of\nthe coming century's leaders of spiritual thought. Our own more special\nduty is to offer through an age of transition more momentous than man\nkind has ever known, that help in steadying and stimulating psychical\nresearch all over the world which our collective experience should\nenable us richly to bestow. Such function ought, I say, to be ours\nindeed. We alone have taken the first steps to deserve it. I see\nour original programme completely justified. I see our raison cFStre\nindisputably established. I see all things coming to pass as we\nforesaw. What I do not see, alas ! is an energy and capacity of our\nown, sufficient for our widening duty ;\u2014enough of labourers for the\nvineyard so ripe for harvest. Speaking, if so I may, for the remnant\nof that small company of labourers of the first hour of the day, I must\nconfess that our strength, at least, cannot suffice for the expanding\ntask ;\u2014nay, could not so suffice, even if Edmund Gurney were with us\nstill ;\u2014n0n, si ipse mens nunc adforet Hector. Other workers, good\nmen and true, have joined themselves to us;\u2014but we have need of many\nmore. We invite them from each department of science, from every\nschool of thought. With equal confidence we appeal for co-operation\nto savant and to saint.\n12. To the savant we point out that we are not trying to pick\nholes in the order of Nature, but rather, by the scrutiny of residual\nphenomena, to get nearer to the origin and operation of Nature's\ncentral mystery of Life. Men who realise that the etherial environ\nment was discovered yesterday need not deem it impossible that a\nmetetherial environment\u2014yet another omnipresent system of cosmic\nlaw\u2014should be discovered to-morrow.

(Vol. XIII.) of our Proceedings, some\napology is due for a second paper on this subject ; the more so as the\nsubject itself, to most intelligent people, appears a contemptible one\nand unworthy of prolonged and serious scientific inquiry. It certainly\nis not one I should have chosen for investigation. However, having\nbeen urged to undertake it, those who may have had the patience to\nroad the mass of evidence given in my former paper will probably have\ncome to the same conclusion as that to which I have been led,\u2014in spite\nof very different preconceived ideas, \u2014namely, that the whole subject is\none eminently worthy of careful investigation ; not only as a question of\nfolk lore and of historical interest, but also because several problems\nof considerable psychological and also physiological interest appear to\nbe involved. In addition to which the main problem before us is a\nsettlement of the disputed point whether mere shrewdness, an \" eye\nfor the ground \" and experience on the part of the so-called \" diviner \"\nafford a sufficient explanation of the success which he so often achieves.\nIt is true that the subject at first dispirits and repels the\ninvestigator from the quantity of rubbish that overlays it and the\ncredulity and ignorance that surround it, and which characterise so\nmany of the enthusiastic votaries and writers on the divining rod, both\nin ancient and modern times But this is equally true of many other\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 133\nobscure questions which this Society was founded to investigate, and\nit is our business to try and discover, with the divining rod of science,\nthe treasure that is buried beneath any soil. As Sir John Herschel\nhas truly said of scientific research in general :\u2014\" He that has seen\nobscurities, which appeared impenetrable, suddenly dispelled, and the\nmost barren and unpromising fields of inquiry converted into rich and\ninexhaustible springs of knowledge on a simple change of our point of\nview, or by bringing to bear on them some principle which it never\noccurred before to try, will be the last to acquiesce in any dispiriting\nprospects.\"1\nBefore entering upon the discussion of the fresh evidence I have\ncollected, it may be convenient to those who approach this subject for\nthe first time if I briefly state by whom, and the purpose for which,\nthe divining rod is at present employed, and how it comes to pass that\nwhat appears at first sight to be a mere relic of a superstitious age\nsurvives amid the scientific light of the present day. Readers of my\nprevious report will, I hope, forgive the repetition.\nThere are in the country districts of England a certain class of\npersons who profess to be able to discover, without geological or local\nknowledge, the exact location of any underground \" spring \" or subter\nranean course of water supply.2 For this purpose they usually, but\nnot always, employ a forked or Y-shaped twig, generally of hazel or\nsome pliant wood. Grasping the ends of the fork in a particular\nmanner,\u2014to which great importance is usually attached, albeit the\nmode of holding has varied in late years in an amusing manner,\u2014the\nholder fixes his attention upon the slightly raised point of the twig,\nand thus becoming as far as possible oblivious to the world around,\nhe traverses the ground. When supposed to be approaching the\nhidden source the twig is seen to quiver, and when the \"diviner\"\nbelieves he is vertically over the \" spring,\" so vigorous is the motion of\nthe twig that it forcibly strikes the holder's body, and, if short enough\nto escape the body, rotates rapidly, though the holder appears to be\ndoing his utmost to restrain its motion; a fact that he will emphatically\ncorroborate, and which seems to be undeniably proved by one limb of\nthe twig being often snapped across, under the strain of the opposing\nforces. The holder of the twig generally appears much exhausted by\nthe effort ; in some cases he complains of sickness or giddiness,\n1 Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy, p. 8.\n- 1 put the word spring in inverted commas, as this term is invariably employed by\nthe \"water-tinder.\" As so used, it is, however, often a very misleading expression.\nIn order to remove misconception on the part of non-geological readers, I have given\nthe reason why this expression is usually incorrect in an Appendix on \"Geological\nViews of the Distribution of Underground Water,\" which will be found in my\nprevious Report. See also Appendix B., p. 340, in the present Report.\n\f134 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\noccasionally the pulse rises, he breaks out into a violent perspiration,\nand trembles all over. As a rule (but not always) he asserts that he\nexperiences singular sensations, resembling muscular cramp, when he\nis over an underground water-course. These sensations are so well\nmarked that in some cases he discards the use of the twig and trusts\nto his sensations alone.1 If now the place be carefully noted beneath\nwhich the hidden water-course is asserted to exist, the probability\nis that, however often the spot be crossed by the holder of the twig,\nthe same phenomena recur, even when his attention is distracted, or\nanother and independent diviner employed. Further, if a well be dug\nat the spot so indicated, water will usually be found at no great depth\nbelow the surface. These water-finders, or diviners, are widely and\nregularly employed, not by ignorant folk, but by some of the most\ndistinguished and clever people in England, by Cabinet Ministers and\nJudges, 2 by shrewd business men and large landowners \u2014 men not\nlikely to waste their money on a silly superstition. In parts of the\nsouth-west of England, in Somersetshire particularly, these water-\nfinders are held in high esteem, and are known as \"dowsers,\" and\ntheir rod as the \"dowsing rod.\"\nThis alleged power of finding underground water, when to an\nordinary observer there appears nothing to betray the presence of\na spring below, is not confined to a professional and paid class\nof men, but is found among amateurs, young and old, male and\nfemale, and in all classes of society. Nor is the dowser only met\nwith in England ; he is found to-day in some parts of France,\nItaly, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Scandinavia, and Finland, and\nflourishing in the United States, Canada, Australia, and doubtless\nin other places of which I have no direct evidence. Many instances\nof the wide distribution of the dowser were given in my former paper,\nand others will be given in the evidence to be cited later on.\nIn my previous paper I gave an account of fourteen contemporary\nEnglish dowsers, all of whom make or add to their living by this means,\nand, in addition, evidence was given of the practical use of the rod by\nupwards of thirty amateurs of both sexes and ranging over every class\nin society, from elderly magistrates to young children. Since then\nseveral other dowsers, both professional and amateur, have come under\nmy notice (see p. 234). I have not, however, found any Scotch or\nIrish professional dowsers, though these countries regularly invite\nthe services of English dowsers. I should say there are at the present\n1 For a fuller account of the sensations alleged to occur in dowsing and the\nevidence thereon see the discussion of this subject in my previous paper, Proceeding!\nS.P.R., Part XXXII., Appendix D.\n3 For example, Lord Salisbury, Lord Lansdowne, and others ; see also the\ntestimony of the Rt. Hon. Sir Edward Fry, D.C.L., F.R.S., etc., p. 226.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 135\ntime in England at least a score of these men engaged in the business\nof water finding, and a very profitable business some of them find it\nto be. Curiously enough I have come across no women professional\ndowsers, though this is contrary to what one might expect.\nThe etymology of the word dowsing rod is uncertain;1 it is first men\ntioned by the philosopher Locke in 1691, who speaks of the \"deusing rod\nor virgula divina.\" Locke was a native of Somersetshire, born under the\nshadow of the Mendips, and for upwards of two centuries the Mendips\nhave been, and still are, the radiating point and stronghold of the\ndowser. The term \" dowsing rod \" is preferable to \" divining rod,\"\nas the latter, or rather its Latin equivalent virgula divina, was used\nby Cicero, Tacitus and other writers of antiquity to denote a wholly\ndifferent thing, namely, divination by rods or bits of stick ; and no\ndoubt a good deal of the prejudice which the term divining rod creates\nat the present day is due to the fact that it suggests to most people\nsome form of rhabdoruancy. The forked divining rod, or virgulafurcata,\nour modern dowsing rod, is not much older than the age of printing,\nand was first described in one of the earliest treatises on mining,\nAgricola's De re Metallica, published in 1546; for its original use was in\nthe search for metallic ores, and, thus used, it spread from South Germany\nto the South of France and thence over Europe, reaching England\ntowards the end of the 16th century.2 Not until the 17th century was\nit used in the search for underground water, but whether for ores or\nwater, the business-like way in which it was employed 3 distinguished\nit from the ancient virgula divina, the efficacy of which was supposed\nto depend on the ceremonies and Kabbalistic words which accompanied\nits use. But among the superstitious and ignorant some of the\npractices of rhabdomancy clung to the new rod along with the old\nname; hence it is that in several descriptions of the divining rod from\nthe 16th century down to the present time we find special importance\n1 See Appendix A to my former paper. With great deference I am inclined to\nbelieve the etymology suggested on p. 261 of that Appendix, viz., from the middle\nEnglish dnschen, to strike, is after all the most likely : the objection raised to this\nby Professor Skeat on the ground of the pronunciation being dowz is much weakened\nif not destroyed by the fact that it is very frequently pronounced in other ways.\nMoreover I find that when the rod was first brought to England at the end of the\n16th or beginning of the 17th century, it was called \"the striking rod,\" schiagruthe,\nby the German miners who brought it over.\n'-' In Germany the word wiinschd ruthe (wishing rod) was, and is still, used as the\nequivalent both of the old divining rod, viryula divina, and the more modern dowsing\nrod, the virgula furcata ; though, as mentioned in the previous foot-note, the German\nminers of the 16th century called the latter schlag-nUhe. Several German writers,\nlong before the age of printing, speak of the wunschel rulhe, and a forked wiintchel\nruthe, it is true, is referred to by one Nithart, a German writer of the 14th century,\nbut in these early cases it was the ancient magic wand, or virgula divina.\n3 This is well seen in pictures from Agricola's work and from Sebastian\nMunster's Cosmography, 1550, one of which we give later on, p. 343.\n\f136 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nattached to the day of the month the diviner was born, the particular\nkind of twig employed, the day or hour on which it was cut, or the\nway it turns for underground water or metallic ores, etc.\nHere, for instance, is an illustration of the survival of this super\nstition, and also of the use of the rod in Jutland. In Kristensen's\nJyske Folkeminder (Popular Traditions of Jutland), published at\nKolding, 1S88, Vol. IX., Section 822, under the heading, Folketro und\nbonde regler (Popular Beliefs and Farming Rules), the following\npassage occurs :\u2014\nIt has been a general custom that, when a well was to be dug, word was\nsent for a \" water-shower \" (vand-viser), who went over the ground with a\nforked (Idoftet) willow-wand. If the twig began to twist about in his\nhand, there was water near the surface, and digging could be begun with\nconfidence.\nMuch the same procedure was followed to discover ore. A two-year-old\nwillow-shoot was taken, which was forked in growth. If water was to bo\nfound it must be of a different age. One who can find ore may not be able\nto discover water : it depends upon what month they are born in. l\nThose who have had experience of an investigation of this\nkind, where people are afraid of being laughed at for giving their\ntestimony, will understand the labour of obtaining accurate evidence\nof eye-witnesses who are willing to append their names. The cor\nrespondence entailed in this inquiry has been endless ; not far short\nof 6,000 letters had to be written for the purpose of my previous\nreport. Upwards of 200 cases of water-finding by dowsers in recent\nyears have been investigated ; in each case the independent evidence\nof disinterested persons who had witnessed the experiments was sought.\nGenerally speaking such evidence was obtained, the witnesses allowing\ntheir names and addresses to be given. Altogether, 152 cases of dowsing\nwere cited in my previous paper ; of these 140 were successful,\u2014that is,\nthe predictions of the dowser were verified, a well was sunk on the\nspot and water found at the place indicated,\u2014and 12 were failures.\nAs one is far less likely to hear of the failures than of the\nsuccesses of amateurs, let us confine our attention only to the profes\nsional dowser. Omitting a remarkably successful series of cases by an\nAmerican dowser, which Dr. Hodgson kindly investigated, 105 cases of\nBritish professional dowsers were given in my former paper ; of these\n95 were successful and 10 were failures. That would make the record\n1 I am indebted to Mr. W. A. Craigie of Oxford for kindly searching Kristensen's\nworks for me, and for the translation of the foregoing passage. Kristensen is an\nauthority on Danish folk-lore, though his books are not to be found in the British\nMuseum. The use of the divining rod in another part of Scandinavia is referred to\nin my previous paper, p. 245. Professor Lochman, of the University of Christiania,\nrecently read a paper in that city in which he said his scepticism on the subject had\nbeen overcome by his own personal experience with the rod.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 137\nof failure less than 10 per cent., which is certainly remarkably small.\n1 have endeavoured to find the percentage of failure which skilled\ngeologists or other scientific experts have made when they are con\nsulted as to water supply,\u2014for failures, and sometimes very costly\nfailures, they have,\u2014but it is difficult to ascertain. I doubt if their\npercentage of failure is less than the average dowser's ; probably it\nvaries very much with the individual employed in each case.1 As\nmight be expected, some professional dowsers, especially those who\nare fond of advertising themselves in newspaper paragraphs, have a\npoor record, and some are unadulterated humbugs. These do their\nbest to conceal their failures, and their success is probably no greater\nthan would have been obtained had a well been sunk at haphazard\nwithout their aid. For in many districts of England, the water-bearing\narea, for shallow wells, lies over a large extent of country, and in such\ndistricts one cannot go far wrong in sinking anywhere.\nI may remark here that, whilst the idea of the illiterate dowser\nconcerning the distribution of underground water is often most\ngrotesque, yet, if I may venture to say so, it is not impossible that\nthe geologist has a good deal to learn on this subject. Although,\nas Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., remarks, many dowsers think water\nexists here and there beneath the surface of the ground, like a\npot of buried coins, instead of, as is often the case, in sheets,\nwherever a permeable stratum, like sand or gravel, meets an imper\nmeable one like clay or slate ; yet on the other hand the wide\npractical experience of those dowsers who are well-sinkers has been too\nmuch overlooked by geologists.2 Underground watercourses do exist,\nunder certain geological conditions, and it is here, where an error\ncan easily be made, that the true test of the dowser comes in. In\ndeep artesian wells skilled geological knowledge is always necessary,\nbut even this sometimes fails completely. Now it must be remem\nbered that the professional dowser is sublimely ignorant of geology\nand has, in general, a contempt for science, \u2014 as a rule, he is an\nilliterate man. It was noticed more than a century ago, both in\nGermany, France, and England, that \" peasants who do not puzzle their\nminds with doubts or reasonings\" (I quote from Pryce's famous mining\nwork of 1778) are the most successful dowsers. This is true to-day.\nThe well-known dowser, the late J. Mullins, was a working mason\nand well-sinker, and his success as a dowser in the discovery of under\nground water was really phenomenal ; he rarely was at fault, and I\nthink we may take it he was the most remarkable dowser this century\nhas produced.\n1 The geologist, however, labours under restrictions which the dowser is free\nfrom ; see on this Mr. Holmes' letter, p. 140.\n2 In support of this view, see Dr. A. B. Wallace's letter on p. 374.\n\f138 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nTwo cases of John Mullins' success were critically and fully\ninvestigated in my former paper\u2014one at Horsham, on the estate\nof Mr., now Sir, Henry Harben, and the other at Waterford, for\nthe large factory of Messrs. Richardson. In both of these, as\nmight be expected, the best geological and engineering advice had\nbeen obtained prior to calling in the dowser. It was only when\nthe resources of science were exhausted,\u2014over \u00a31,000 having been\nspent in each case in fruitless sinkings and borings in different\nplaces on the estate,\u2014that Mullins was at last sent for, in 1889\nto Waterford, and in 1893 to Horsham. He was an entire stranger\nto the neighbourhood in both cases, and was received, not unnaturally,\nwith a good deal of suspicion. At Horsham he quickly pointed\nout two places where an abundant supply of water would be found\nwithin a moderate depth, and his predictions were verified to the\nletter. I have visited the spot and obtained the evidence of eye\nwitnesses, including Sir H. Harben, and at my request the place\nhas been visited by competent geologists. The case was ably discussed\nfrom a geological point of view by Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., past\nPresident of the London Geologists' Association, and Mr. E. Westlake,\nF.G.S., in my previous Report, pp. 221-230 and 278-280.\nThe case of Waterford is still more remarkable ; I will not repeat\nthe details, which will bear careful study, as it is, I think, one of the\nmost remarkable cases in the whole voluminous literature of the rod.\nSuffice it to say, that the rock there is of a hard slaty nature called\nOrdovician, it is hidden beneath a surface bed of some 40 ft. of\nboulder clay and in the search for water various wells and borings had\nbeen fruitlessly made, one boring being over 1,000 ft. deep. Not far\nfrom this deep and useless boring, made under the best scientific advice,\nMullins found the twig turn vigorously ; he traced what he said was a\nline of copious water supply\u2014either a line of jointing or a \" fault \"\nin the hidden rock\u2014and fixed on one point as being the best to sink\nthe well, asserting water to the extent of 1,500 gallons an hour would\nbe found at a depth of some 80 or 90 ft. I need not say that\nno one believed him, but in despair a boring was made at this spot,\nwhen suddenly, at the depth of 81 ft., water burst up the bore tube\nand rose half way to the surface. After pumping day and night, the\nsupply could not be run dry ; it was measured and the yield was found\nto be 2,000 gallons per hour, which has been maintained with but\nslight fluctuations from 1889, when the experiment was made, to the\npresent time, a period of eleven years. These statements have the\nadvantage of being corroborated by eye-witnesses and by letters\nwritten at the time, not by gullible, ignorant people, but by educated\nmen, including a well-known local geologist, Mr. Budd, who held as\nit were a watching brief against Mullins ; and by Mr. Kinahan, a\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 139\ndistinguished geologist of H.M. Irish Geological Survey, as well as by\nMr. Richardson himself. In fact Mr. Kinahan (who, as one of the best\nIrish geological authorities, was consulted by Mr. Richardson), writes to\nme : \"As far as the actual results went I failed, and the diviner\n'wiped my eye.'\" No surface observation nor experience, nor \"an\neye for the ground \" can explain this Waterford case, nor some others\nI shall refer to in the sequel.\nOn the other hand, in the opinion of competent geologists who\nhave kindly given me their aid in this inquiry, several cases where the\ndowser has had a striking success, and which at first sight appear to\nsuggest some power transcending any recognised faculty, were found,\nupon geological observation on the spot, to be capable of explanation\nby the rapid detection of surface indications of underground water\nby the dowser. This will be seen from the useful geological notes\nMr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., has kindly appended to some of the cases\nin the previous and also in the present Report. A fuller investigation\nof several cases was, at my request, undertaken by Mr. E. Westlake,\nF.G.S., who has made a special study of hydro-geology, and whose\nvaluable co-operation throughout this inquiry I have already acknow\nledged. Mr. Westlake selected a group of cases, given in the previous\nReport, which appeared to be evidential of some special faculty\npossessed by the dowser, and visited each of the places ; the result\nof his investigations is given in the able paper which forms an\nAppendix to the present Report, see p. 315. It will be observed\nthat Mr. Westlake is of opinion that many of these cases can be\nexplained without calling in the aid of any novel faculty or instinct\non the part of the dowser\u2014merely a sharp eye for the ground was\nrequired. At the same time we must remember it is much easier\nto prophesy after the event than before it, and it remains to be seen\nwhether our geological friends would have thought the location of\nthe site in these cases quite as obvious before the well had been sunk,\nor the dowser had visited the spot, as it seemed to be afterwards.\nHowever that may be, I gratefully accept the opinion of geological\nexperts, and will here quote a letter which expresses Mr. Holmes'\nviews on the subject.\n28, Crooms Hill, Greenwich Park, London, S.E.,\nDecember lUh, 1899.\nI may add that I am attracted, not repelled, by the supernormal, for\nour senses must give us extremely limited perceptions of things as compared\nwith the perceptions possible to more highly gifted beings. Hence, among\nourselves, there is no improbability in the existence of powers of special per\nception in individual cases, even though the total range of perception\nmay not be supernormal. Thus if the line A.B. represents the normal range\nof a sense, there may be abnormally gifted persons whose range is not\n\f140 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\ngreater, but is more extensive at one end of the scale, if correspondingly\nless so at the other, like the line C.D.\nA. B.\nC. D.\nHowever, it has always struck me that while stories of apparitions, &c.,\nare treated with a curious ultra-scepticism in many cases, the dowser's\nclaims to supernormal powers have been admitted with the most extra\nordinary alacrity.1\nAs the position of our old towns and villages testifies, the men who knew\nwhere water might be attained at a depth of from 5 to 50ft. have always\nbeen with us. Geologists generally do not trouble themselves with water,\nas regards supply for dwellings, though anxious to know whether the super\nficial formations are deep sea, shallow sea, estuarine river, glacial, etc.\nAnd the cholera in the first half of tho century so discredited water from\nsuperficial deposits that supplies from those sources have not been trusted,\neven when sufficiently good. The dowser's supply is voted excellent, and\nhe is triumphant where a hydro-geologist would feel that he would be\ndeservedly blamed for recommending it, should it become polluted and cause\ndisease.\nAll I feel is that an eye for ground can do very much and can be\nimmensely developed by experience. The dowser needs no geological know\nledge beyond what he might have had a century ago. The most remarkable\nsuccesses of dowsers are those in which sensitiveness to the proximity of\nwater cannot have helped them, while their views as to its distribution seem\nfatal to the hypothesis that they are influenced by special sensitiveness.\nSomehow, the more one looks ink) cases, the more the supernormal recedes.\nI quite agree with you that the twisting of the twig\u2014though a most\ninteresting phenomenon\u2014has no [direct nor invariable] connection with the\nnearness of underground water. m y rrOLmys\nThe dowser asserts that he does not concern himself with the\nnature of the ground, but is guided solely by the twisting of his\nforked twig or by some peculiar sensation he experiences. In this\ncase one would have expected to find some blind dowsers, as the\nblind are peculiarly sensitive in some directions, but\u2014though I know\nthe extensive literature of the divining rod pretty thoroughly\u2014 I\nhave not been able to find a single blind dowser in any country in the\nworld during the four centuries the dowsing rod has been employed.\nIt may be urged that blind people could not engage in the peregrina\ntions required of a dowser, nor properly hold the forked twig if they\nhad a guide. This may be so, but I do not think it is the true\nanswer, for I can find no account of the sudden and involuntary\ntwisting of the rod in the hands of any blind person under any\n1 By some persons, certainly not by geologists, nor by the Council of the S.P.R.\nnor by myself.\u2014W.F.B.\n\fxxxvni.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 141\nconditions : blind people may not have been tried, and I intended,\nhad time permitted, to have tested the inmates of a blind asylum.\nThe true explanation, I believe, will be found in the fact that the\nrod only moves in the hands of a novice when he has seen it \"work\" in\nthe hands of somebody else ; it would no doubt move with many blind\npeople if they had previously felt the hands and the twig of a dowser\nwhen the latter is twisting. In any case the absurdity of imagining\nthere is any direct connection between underground water and the\nmotion of the so-called divining rod is seen from the fact that the first\nuse of the rod was for finding underground ores, then for finding\nburied treasure, then for tracing lost cattle or boundaries, then for a\nmultitude of uses in the moral world (until its employment for this\nlatter purpose was forbidden by the Inquisition in 1701), and at the\npresent day dowsers profess to discover, not only underground water\nand mineral lodes, but hidden coins, water or gas pipes, etc., by the\ntwisting of their rod. Obviously, therefore, the peculiar involuntary\nmotion of the rod and what causes this motion is one thing, and the\nexistence of an alleged dowsing, or water-fiuding, faculty is quite\nanother.\nObject of our Investioation.\nThis brings us to an important point in our investigation. We\nmust know clearly wJiat we are seeking for. Is it for the cause of\nthe motion of the dowsing rod, or for a proof or disproof of an alleged\n\" dowsing faculty,\" or for a particular explanation of that faculty,\nassuming it to exist? Now it will be found that nearly every\nscientific investigator of the divining rod during the last 100\nyears has set out with some theory of the action of the dowsing\nrod, which, when he has satisfactorily demolished, he has asserted\nthe whole thing was a fraud. Some of the most famous names\nin French scientific history a century ago, when they showed that\nelectricity afforded no explanation of the movement of the divining\nrod, asserted they had disproved the existence of the alleged faculty\nitself. Had they been versed in the history of the subject,\nthey would have found that a century prior to their day equally\neminent French savants asserted the same thing, because they had\ndemonstrated the devil was not the cause of the twisting of the forked\ntwig. And now, in our own day, no less eminent French, American,\nand English men of science assert,\u2014electricity and the devil having\nbeen laid,\u2014that involuntary muscular action on the part of the\ndowser finally disposes of the divining rod and the mystery of an\nalleged dowsing faculty. This, of course, is equally erroneous.\nAssuming this explanation to be established, all that it explains\nis the twisting of the rod. Here is an instance of this fallacy.\n\f142 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nMr Emerson, to whom I have already referred1, published in the\nAmerican Journal of Science (SiUiman's Journal) for 1821 a series of\nremarkable cases, showing how underground water had been found by\ndowsers where it had previously been sought for in vain. Five years\nlater he was led to an ingenious theory of the motion of the rod as due\nto involuntary muscular action, an explanation we may readily admit :\nthen after blindfolding a young boy, in whose hands the forked twig\nmoved, albeit he had never been tested as a dowser, Mr. Emerson\ndraws the following sweeping conclusions from the failure of some\nfallacious experiments which we have given later on, p. 212 :\u2014\nThe pretensions of diviners are worthless. The art of finding fountains\nand minerals with a succulent twig is a cheat upon those who practise it, an\noffence to reason and to common sense, an art abhorrent to the laws of\nnature, and deserving of universal reprobation.\nI venture to say that the majority of scientific men who have read\nEmerson's papers will imagine he has proved his assertions, and that the\nquestion had been finally settled by him, just as in Europe it was con\nsidered that Chevreul in 1854 had settled the question by a similar\nexplanation, forgetting that the astronomer Lalande had also given a\nsimilar explanation in 1782. What a hardy perennial this superficial\nand easy dismissal of the whole subject is may be seen in a recent\nletter in the scientific journal Nature (January 6th, 1898), which I\nhave quoted elsewhere, p. 288. Here, once more, an American professor\ntells us \"the whole secret of the divining rod \" is to be found in the\ninvoluntary muscular action of the operator.\nAnd so also with regard to blindfolding. If well-conducted\nexperiments, with a good dowser, show that blindfolding prevents the\ndowser from fixing on the same spots that he did when he could see,\u2014\nplaces where he alleged underground water to exist, \u2014all we have\nproved is the extreme improbability of any direct influence of the\nwater on the dowser, or any clairvoyant perception on his part.\nFailure when blindfolded does not prove the dowser to be a charlatan,\nbut merely that a particular physical or psychical explanation is im\nprobable. For the success of the dowser under normal conditions may\nstill be due to some instinct or faculty, derived from a rapid but sub\nconscious observation and interpretation of the surface indications of\nunderground water or mineral lodes, or his success may be due merely\nto experience and shrewd observation, which, from habitude, has almost\nceased to excite a conscious effort As eyesight would be necessary in\neither of these cases, the dowsing faculty, if there be such, would in\nthis event take its place along with other familiar illustrations of\nkeenness of perception in men and animals.\n1 See previous ReIiort, p. 44. Not Ralph Waldo Emerson, but a conteruiiorary\nand namesake.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 143\nLet us therefore clearly recognise in our experiments what is the\naim we have in view. A particular theory may be proved to be wrong,\nbut the important point is to obtain trustworthy evidence of all the\nfacts in each case, and when a sufficiently wide range of evidence is\nbefore us, to endeavour to arrive at some explanation. It is for this\nreason that I have been compelled to burden this and the previous\nReport with such an accumulation of cases, for the subject is full of\ndifficulties from a scientific point of view, and any explanation we\nmay give must be based upon an extensive survey, and is likely to be\neither a tentative or a complex one.\nWe may summarise the objects of our investigation as follows :\u2014,\nI. Whether the alleged claim of the dowser to a special faculty,\nor even facility, in the discovery of underground water or mineral\nlodes has any basis in fact, and if so :\u2014\n(i.) Whether this is due merely to knowledge acquired by the\ndowser from experience and careful observation of the ground ; or\n(ii.) Whether such information is derived by some instinctive\nand subconscious process of observation on the part of the\ndowser, or perhaps hypenesthetic discernment of surface signs too\nfaint to be perceived by the ordinary observer ; or\n(iii.) Whether there is evidence of any supernormal perception\nby the dowser\u2014that is, information derived subconsciously other\nwise than through the ordinary channels of sense.\nII. The evidence for and the explanation of: (i.) the sudden and\noften uncontrollable movement of the rod in the hands of the dowser ;\n(ii.) the apparent transmission of this power of motor-automatism from\na sensitive to an insensitive person ; and (iii.) the singular malaise\nand convulsive spasm which is associated in so many dowsers with the\ninvoluntary motion of the rod.\nIII. The History and Bibliography of the subject. These have\nbeen prepared, but the matter is so voluminous that it must be\npublished later on.\nI propose to begin with No. 1 \u2014further tests as to the alleged\nclaims of the dowser.\n\f144 Professor IF. F. Barrett. [paht\nPART II.\nExperiments by the Author.\nS 1. The Carru\/oona Experiments,\nIt has been suggested l that the most satisfactory test of the\nalleged claims of the dowser would be to carry out some experiments\nunder my own personal supervision, boring or sinking wells in places\nwhere the dowser indicated water would or would not be found. As I\nhave said elsewhere, this can only be a very restricted test, owing to the\nexpense involved, and, unless care be taken, may be as inconclusive\nas were Professor Sollas's two test borings described in the previous\nReport, pp. 220 and 221. However, I determined to make the\nattempt, and have done so this spring and summer, with the results I\nwill now give. In order that an impartial judgment may be arrived\nat by my readers a somewhat detailed account is, I fear, unavoidable.\nCertain precautions were necessary if any satisfactory evidence one\nway or the other was to be obtained. (1) The place chosen must be\none entirely unfamiliar to the dowser, and no opportunity must be\nallowed him of knowing beforehand where the experiment is to be\nmade, otherwise the dowser might make a prior careful examination\nof a geological map of the district (assuming he had access to such\nmaps and could understand them \u2014 a possible assumption) ; such\nexamination would doubtless yield a good deal of valuable information\nto a clever man. (2) The district selected must be one geologically\nsuitable, that is to say, not a large water-bearing or waterless area,\nthe character of which he might discern at a glance, and where he\ncould not go wrong anywhere in predicting water or no water.\n(3) The dowser should be taken direct to the place and not allowed to\nget any information from persons living in the neighbourhood as to\nthe position of any existing springs or wells. (4) The persons who\naccompany the dowser should also be ignorant of the likeliest spots\nwhere water would or would not be found, lest they perchance\nconsciously or unconsciously convey their knowledge to the dowser.\nThese conditions were all successfully met, the place I selected\n\u2014a mountainous region in the co. Wicklow, four miles from Bray\u2014\nadmirably fulfilling the geological conditions required, and a region I\nbelieve no dowser had ever visited. I wrote to two or three of the\nbest known English professional dowsers, asking them if they could\ncome over, and as Mr. Stone replied he was shortly coming to Ireland,\nI arranged to see him. On his arrival he had no idea where the\n1 In a review of my previous Report in Nature, October 14th, 1897.\n\fXXXVIII.] 145\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nexperiment was to be made, nor did I tell him, but took him\nstraightway to the place. My friend Mr. B. St. G. Lefroy accom\npanied us to take notes as an independent careful observer, and the\nmemorandum he has written will be given directly. It was Easter\nweek, 1899, and the day was fine. Mr. Stone told me he had never\nbeen in co. Wicklow before, and I have no doubt that is quite time.\nLeaving our car in the Rocky Valley, we ascended the mountain road\nleading round a hill called Carrigoona, on the lower slopes of which\nthere are patches of cultivated ground, but the quartzite rock of which\nthe hill is composed juts out here and there, though the hillside is\ngenerally covered with two or three feet of alluvial soil, on which\ngorse and heather and bracken grow, clothing the mountain with a\ngarment of beauty. The panorama from the mountain-side is also\none of unsurpassed beauty, and stirred the emotions of my geological\nfriends who afterwards visited the spot with me.\nFor the accompanying geological map of the district I am in\ndebted to the kindness of H. M. Geological Survey. The field we\n^GREAT**SUGARLOAF **?*>*'\n* \u00ab MOUNTAIN ***\u00a3*< '* * *\nScale: Six inches to the mile.

Barrett.\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 147\nview of the surrounding country is shown in the picture opposite,\nFig. 2 ; this is taken from a rocky eminence on the south-eastern\ncorner of the field E and is therefore looking nearly west : Carrigoona\nmountain is seen on the right hand side of the picture ; only the\nsummit of the quartzite knoll in the middle distance is visible when in\nthe field, where the boring operations are seen going on as described\nsubsequently.1\nExperiment I.\nHaving secured the necessary permission, I took Mr. Stone first to\nthe field, E, Fig. 1, rather over an acre in extent, and asked him to\nbegin operations. He pulled out a slender forked twig from his pocket,\nand immediately walked round the field ; at one spot the twig forcibly\nrevolved, and he said we should find plenty of water there, less than\n15 ft. deep. The spot was marked, and after traversing the field two\nor three times he asserted that water was flowing from north to south\nalong a line or region he traced out, but that at the side of the field very\nlittle, if any, water would be found.2 \" Bore anywhere along this line,\"\nhe said (see dotted line in Fig. 3), \" and you will get plenty of water,\nbut very little or none over there,\" i.e., on the east side of the field.\nThe places were marked and subsequently fixed by measurement, so\nthat the marks could be removed. All round the field was a rough\nstone wall, overtopped to a height of 8 ft. or 9 ft. by a thick gorse\nhedge, so that it was impossible to see a plateau of rock that flanked\nthe east and west sides of the field beyond the boundary wall ; I\nmention this for a reason that will appear presently. The field was\non the mountain side, it sloped downwards from north to south, was\nuniformly covered with grass, and had no trace of water anywhere on\nthe surface.\nExperiment II.\nFrom this field we crossed the mountain and went to an enclosed\npiece of the commons on the western side of Carrigoona, marked W on\nthe map, Fig. 1. Here, again, I asked Mr. Stone to select two test\nplaces. He walked round the field, but there was no motion of his\nforked twig. It so happened a friend had purchased this field in order\nto erect a summer cottage, and particularly wanted to find a spring.\nNoticing a patch of rank and very green grass I asked him to try that\nspot. \" No good,\" he said ; \" it's no good boring anywhere in this\nfield ; there is little or no water.\" Pressed to try once more, he fixed\non one spot as best to bore, but said only a little water, \"of no use,'\n1 1 have to thank Mr. Kendrew for the photograph of which Fig. 2 is a reproduc\ntion ; unfortunately the reproduction does not do justice to the original photograph.\n3 The three dots on the field E, Fig. 1, indicate these places, and where the bore\nholes were subsequently made.

Mr. Jones used a small, slender\nforked twig, which he held in the same way as the elder Mullins. We\n\fxxxvin.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 149\nwent, first, to the larger field on the east of Carrigoona. On completing\nhis perambulation of the field we examined the places marked by Mr.\nJones. The spot where the twig moved most vigorously with him,\nand where he was confident we should find water, was not a foot\ndistant from the place selected by Mr. Stone, as we found subsequently\nby measurement with the tape. This was at No. 1, in Fig. 3. Mr.\nJones also asserted the watercourse ran from north to south in the field,\nin the same direction as marked out by Mr. Stone ; but from the\nmovement of the twig he asserted we should also find water a few feet\non the east side of the place marked No. 1, but flowing towards Stone's\nline. We then crossed the mountain to the smaller field on the western\nside ; after Mr. Jones had traversed it with his \" rod \" he said much\nas Mr. Stone did, that very little, if any, water would be found there.\nBorings.\nIt was not until July, 1899, that the boring apparatus arrived.\nMr. Stone had kindly placed it at my disposal, so that the only\nexpense incurred was for labour and the services of his brother, Mr.\nE. Stone, who was a skilful working engineer. A four-inch bore-hole\nwas made in each case; a hardened steel \"jumper\" and the usual boring\ntools being employed. Fig. 4, p. 146, shows the boring apparatus at\nwork. Mr. E. Stone is standing on the left of the picture, and the men\nare boring with the jumper. The thick gorse hedge is seen round the\nfield. From conversation with the farmer who had tilled the\neastern field for many years, we expected to reach the bed rock\nsome 6 ft. below the surface, and I anticipated a laborious and\ncostly boring if we were to get anything better than surface\nwater. As I had taken a farmhouse for the summer on the northern\nslope of Carrigoona, I was able daily to inspect the result of the\nboring operations. We commenced at the spot marked No. 1 in\nFig. 3, and a foot below the surface struck a very hard dry clay ;\nthis went on for a depth of 8 ft., with slow progress, until suddenly,\nafter two days' work, a bed of sand was encountered, through which\nthe \"jumper\" sank, and water rushed up the bore-hole to within\n4 ft. of the surface. After 4 ft. of sand a bed of gravel was reached,\nbut the quantity of water was so great that the sides of the lower\npart of the bore-hole were constantly washed in, and we could not\nsink deeper until a lining tube .was obtained. As this could only be\nprocured in London, we proceeded to test the east side of the field,\nwhere Mr. Stone said little or no water would be got. Here No. 2\nbore-hole was sunk, and nothing but a hard clay, with stones intermixed\nin one part, was met with till the rock was reached at a depth of\n12 ft., when a little water was found between the rock and the\nimpermeable stratum above it. I made them continue boring to a\n\f150 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ndepth of 1 ft. 6 in. into the solid quartzite rock, but no more water was\nobtained. We then began No. 3 bore-hole, on what Mr. Stone called\nthe \"water-line.\" The boring was similar in its results to No. 1, the\nwater-bearing permeable stratum being struck 6 ft. below the surface,\nFia. 4.\nIN THE FIELD, LOOKING NORTH.\nand abundant water rose in the bore-hole. The boring was continued\nwhen a bed of soft plastic clay was reached, and after this a hard clay\nmixed with pebbles.

Then I had a bore-hole sunk at the spot\nfixed on by Mr. Stone as likely to yield a little water, but \" no use,\"\nas he remarked, (this is No. 5 bore-hole) ; here, after the shingle, we\nNo. 4 Bore-Hole, 11 ft. 6 in. deep.\nNo IVaUr.\nNo. 5 Bore-Hole, 10 ft. deep.\nNo H'atrr.\nFio. 6.\nreached a hard dry clay, and continued boring through this until the\nrocky bed was encountered at a depth of 14 ft. from the surface, but\nno trace of water was found. This field slopes sharply down from east\nto west, and No. 5 borehole is at some 10 ft. lower level than No. 4,\nwhich is on the upper eastern side of the field. . Finally, I had a small\ntrial bore made at the lowest point in the field adjoining the mountain\nroad, but only dry shingle, and no sign of water, was met with. Here,\nagain, Stone's predictions were verified ; there might have been a little\nwater between the impermeable clay and the rocky bed when he made\nhis trial at Easter, as it was then in the early spring, after rains.1 The\nborings were all made in the long drought we had during the summer\n1 Subsequently, after the summer drought, Mr. Lefroy noticed a little water at\nthe bottom of this bore-hole, see P.S. to his memorandum, p. 150.\n\fxxxvin.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 153\nof the present year ; it was, therefore, all the more astonishing to\nfind such a good supply of water in the No. 1 and No. 3 borings in the\neastern field.\nAfter the perforated lining tube had arrived we were able to go on\nboring in No. 1 hole, but found a second bed of clay below the gravel,\nand reached no rock, though we went down 20 ft. All the water was\ntherefore supplied by the permeable layer between the two impermeable\nclays. In order to test the quantity, I procured a pump and 15 ft. of\niron tubing, and found that No. 1 bore-hole yielded five gallons a\nminute, which, if the supply held, would be equivalent to over 7,000\ngallons in the 24 hours. After pumping 10 minutes, however, the\npump choked, and the water was then found to stand 8 ft. from the\nsurface ; it had been lowered about 4 ft. in the four-inch bore-hole.\nThe water was flowing in all the time through the perforations in the\nlining tube, but not sufficiently rapidly to maintain a constant level, as\nthe pump was a powerful one. The temperature of the water was some\n20 deg. F. below that of the air. No. 2 bore-hole contained so little\nwater that we were able, in a few minutes, almost to empty the bore\nhole by ladling out the water with a small tin can. The pump had\nto be sent back to Dublin for repair, and another trial was postponed\ntill early in November, as my geological friends thought a more crucial\ntest would be afforded at that period of the year.\nI will now give the account of Stone's visit, which Mr. Lefroy\nkindly sent to me.\nAugust, 1899.\nOn April 2nd, 1899, Professor Barrett invited me to accompany him and\nMr. Stone, an English \"dowser,\" to a field in the Rocky Valley, co. Wick-\nlow. We drove directly from Bray station to the field, which is enclosed\nby a high stone fence, partly covered by a gorse hedge. The configuration\nof the immediately adjacent land cannot be seen from the field, owing\nto its situation and the height of this fence and hedge. The area is between\none and two acres in extent. Mr. Stone had no opportunity afforded him of\nexamining the surroundings of the field except upon the side of approach,\nnor did he, I fully believe, receive any information on that subject, to which\nhe made no reference in my hearing, and was apparently indifferent. I\nwatched him closely, but saw no sign of attention on his part to surface\nindications, if any existed.\nHe traversed the field in various directions, holding a fork of the\ndivining rod between the forefinger and thumb of each hand. His manner\nwas that of easy confidence, and he readily maintained a conversation at the\nsame time. At certain points the rod in his hands was violently twisted.\nOne of these points, marked \"No. 1\" on the plan, Fig. 3, he stated to be that\nmost suitable for boring purposes and he declared that a sufficient supply\nof water for domestic use would be found there at a very moderate depth.\nTo the best of my recollection he said not more than 15 ft., but of this I am\nnot now certain. The other points at which the rod was notably contorted\n\f154 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nwere in a line south from this, which he attributed to the existence of an\nunderground watercourse. The direction of this is shown on the plan by\nthe dotted line.\nThe positions of these points Professor Barrett and I measured at once\nand noted on a rough plan. The line of the asserted watercourse was\nmarked by taking the distances from the side of the field. Except on\nthat line, only very slight movements of the rod were anywhere observable,\nand an area in the eastern portion of the field was designated by Mr. Stone\nas practically waterless. The test boring subsequently made in this area is\nmarked \"No. 2\" on the plan.\nOn April 22nd, I again visited the place with Professor Barrett and Mr.\nJones, of Waterford, an amateur \"dowser.\" The same conditions were\nrepeated. He saw no more of the surrounding land than was strictly\nunavoidable and appeared to pay no attention to that or to any indications\nother than those furnished by the \"rod.\" No marks had been left by\nwhich the places selected by Mr. Stone as yielding water could have been\nidentified or guessed at. Mr. Jones walked over the field as Mr. Stone had\ndone, the \"rod\" behaved similarly in his hands, and his results were\npractically the same. The difference of a foot or so in the \"best\" point\nselected may be reasonably attributed to his crossing the line of the water\ncourse referred to at a different point.\nFrom this field, which is on the eastern side of Carrigoona Hill, we went,\non the day first mentioned, to the western side, and Mr. Stone was asked to\nfind a spring in a small field on that side. He walked over this field in the\nsame manner with the rod, and said that no water, or so little as to be\nuseless, would be found in it,\u2014that there were traces of water at a certain\nspot, but that it would be \"no good boring.\" Mr. Jones also went with us\nto this other field and he confirmed what Mr. Stone had said of there being\nlittle water to be found there. -n o n t\nB. St. G. Lefroy.\nP.S.\u2014Since the borings have been made, I have measured and verified\ntheir positions with Professor Barrett, and on November 5th, 1899, I again\nvisited Carrigoona, and made a careful examination of the borings. In the\nfield on the eastern side, the one first tried by Mr. Stone, I found the water\nin boring marked No. 1 in the plan [see Fig. 3] standing 6 ft. from the\nground level. The water in boring No. 3, on the line of the watercourse\nalleged by Mr. Stone to exist, stood 6 ft. 3 in. from the surface of the\nground. The boring No. 2 was dry. In the field on the western slope of the\nhill I found the upper boring [No. 4] quite dry, and the lower boring [No. 5]\nhad four or five inches of water in it [Fig. <5], These results agree with the\npredictions made by Mr. Stone, and also by Mr. Jones, before the borings\nwere made. B gT Q L\nAlthough the excellent maps of the Irish Geological Survey had\ngiven me a general knowledge of the suitability of the locality chosen\nfor the experiments before they were made, it seemed desirable that\nthe opinion of some recognised geological authorities should be obtained.\nFor this purpose I asked some of my geological friends, who were\n\fxxxviii.] 0?i the So-called Divining Rod. 155\nintimately acquainted with the geology of that district, to visit the\nfields where the experiments were conducted, and I gratefully acknow\nledge their kindness in doing so and furnishing me with the accom\npanying valuable reports. It would have been fairer to the dowser\nhad I asked the geologists to come be\/ore the borings were made, as\nthe depth (which I informed them) to which borings Nbs. 1 and 3\nwere made, and yet no rock reached, revealed the unsuspected fact\nthat the field was on the site of an ancient and deep V-shaped\ndepression or narrow valley between the rocks, probably an ancient\nriver bed now filled with drift. The first report is from my friend and\ncolleague Professor Grenville Cole, F.G.S., the professor of geology in\nthe Royal College of Science, Dublin.\nAugust 20th, 1899.\n(i) The Rocky Valley is cut by denudation through the ancient series of\nshales and sandstones, altered to slates and quartzites, which occur in the\nSugar Loaf area,1 at Bray Head, and at Howth. Unless a fissure were\nfortunately struck, it would be very difficult to find water in this series. It\nis not a water-bearing series in itself, as is well known to residents at\nHowth, who are in the habit of collecting rain and surface-water.\nBut in the Rocky Valley area, considerable deposits of glacial drift occur,\nvarying from clays to permeable sands, filling all the ancient hollows carved\nin the slates and quartzites. A trained eye readily picks out, by contour\nand the green or cultivated patches, the position of the sands and gravels\nwhere they abut on the older series.\nThe heights are formed of slate and quartzite, on which heather and\nsome thin bogs accumulate.2 The rainfall on these is considerable, and\nsoaks off down into the old waterways, carved before glacial times, in the\nrocky bed. As these hollows are full of drift, the drift, where sand and\ngravel prevail, absorbs the water. The supply at any point, by tapping the\ndrift, must depend greatly on the extent of the impervious gathering-\nground round about, and would, in any case, probably diminish in autumn\nafter a dry summer.\n(ii) The field selected for boring in the Rocky Valley shows a marked\ngreen surface, with the hard quartzite sloping steeply down close at hand on\neither side. It falls towards the valley, and so, evidently, does the old\nrocky bed under the infilling of drift. Water would accumulate in the\ninfilling, and would probably flow slowly down along the middle line of the\nold hollow. Its constancy may be doubted, but can be tested satisfactorily\nafter the present dry season (August, 1899). A trained eye would certainly\nselect the central line of the field, along the ancient stream-hollow, for\nGrenville A. J. Cole.\n1 The \"Sugar Loaf\" is the miserable n^dern name given to one of the most\nbeautiful and impressive mountains in the co. Wioklow, a mountain rising to\nnearly 1700 ft. high, and flanking one side of the Rocky Valley as Carrigoona\ndoes the other.\u2014W. F. B.\n2 This refers to the Sugar Loaf, as there are no bogs on Carrigoona.\u2014-W.F.B.\n\f156 [part\nProfexsor W. F. Barrett.\nIn a subsequent letter Professor Cole says :\u2014\nI think a professional engineer would undoubtedly bore two or three\nholes along the line under which the two rock slopes at either side meet ;\nthis line might or might not be along the lowest line of the hummocky\nsurface of the field above, where the borings were made. I am clearly of\nopinion that a casual visitor who knew anything about general conditions\nof water supply would proceed a good distance from the obvious rock on\neither side before he predicted a fair water supply. But I also feel with\nyou that the rapid survey and determination in two minutes or so [by the\ndowser] show either exceptional powers of observation or confidence in\nsome power not possessed by ordinary engineers.\nFio. 7.\nlooking east.\nWith all deference to my friend Professor Cole, I am quite sure\nthat the rocky contour immediately on each side of the field was not\nobserved by Mr. Stone, nor could it be seen from the side that we\napproached. It requires a trained geological eye, after traversing the\nground round about, to arrive at the conclusions stated by Professor\nCole. I myself had been over the place dozens of times, having spent\ntwo summers in the neighbourhood, and I confess that before the borings\nwere made there appeared to me no evidence that the \" hard quartzite\nsloped steeply down close at hand on either side,\" leaving a deep\nravine filled in with glacial drift. As can be seen to some extent from\nthe photograph reproduced in Fig. 7, to all appearance the local\n\fxxxvni.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 157\nopinion seemed probable enough\u2014that the field was simply a layer of\na few feet of clay over a rocky bed which was nearly level from east\nto west.1\nIt was desirable, in order to decide the question as to the exact\nlevels of the respective bore-holes, that a careful survey of the field\nshould be made For this purpose my friend and former student,\nMr. J. A. Cunningham, B.A., kindly assisted me in taking the levels\nshown in Figs. 8 and 9 on the next page. In these diagrams the\nvertical scale is exaggerated five times the horizontal, the surface\ndepression shown in Fig. 8 not being perceptible in the field. These\ndiagrams illustrate the probable geological sections of the field from\nbore-hole No. 1 to No. 2, nearly west and east, and also the section\nfrom north to south. It will be observed in Fig. 8 that the\nnearly dry borehole No. 2 is actually a little lower than the\nwater-bearing hole No. 1. Possibly water might be found between\nNos. 1 and 2 ; in fact, Mr. Jones predicted it would be a few\nfeet to the east of No. 1. But this can only be settled by boring at\nintervals across from west to east ; I hope to be able to do this\neventually. As the bed rock was not reached in bore holes Nos. 1 and\n3, its representation in both sections is in part imaginary, as is the\nlateral extent of the layer of sand in Fig. 8.\nFor the next memorandum I am greatly indebted to my friend\nMr. J. R. Kilroe, of H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland. Mr.\nKilroe, it will be remembered, gave me the benefit of his geological\nknowledge in the famous Waterford case described in the previous\nReport, and on the present occasion he at once responded to my\nrequest and, at considerable inconvenience, came from a distance on\npurpose to inspect the field.\nCarrigoona Hill, rising to the moderate height of 802 ft. above the sea,\ncommands one of the most attractive and varied panoramas in Wicklow.\nFrom its foot, eastward, spreads the park-like country containing and\nadjoining Kilruddery, the Earl of Meath's demesne, to the town of Bray\nand the sea beyond. North-westward the hill overlooks the Dargle Valley\nwhich separates it from the Dublin and Wicklow Mountains. Southward\nthe eye is attracted by the valley of Killough, from which, on its east side,\nrises almost precipitously the Great Sugarloaf Mountain to a height of\n1,659 ft. \u2014this beautiful conical hill being separated from Carrigoona by the\nnarrow, weird gorge known as the Rocky Valley. Further eastward the\nLittle Sugarloaf Mountain bounds the landscape beyond the vale of\nKilmacanoge.\nThe hills named above\u2014Carrigoona, with the Great and Little Sugarloaf\n,\u2014constitute a group standing above the general level of the surrounding\ncountry, a circumstance attributable to the greater resistance offered to\n1 I am much indebted to Mr. Kendrew, of Dublin, for the photographs here\nreproduced.

Bands of slate also occur with the\nquartzite ; and the results of unequal denudation are apparent in the\nuneven\u2014in some places, rugged\u2014aspect presented by the higher ground.\nThe rocky bed is largely covered with a mantle of glacial drift, which,\nthough chiefly occurring in the low ground, is of fairly general distribution,\nresting in various places on the hill-sides, and partially filling hollows\nbetween crags. In these latter cases, the drift consists of local rock\ndetritus, chiefly a mixture of sand, clay, and pebbles of slate and quartzite.\nLimestone pebbles also are interspersed in the drift which skirts the hill\nslopes ; but few, if any, are to be found at higher elevations. The drift in\nthe latter positions usually contain lenticular layers of sand and gravel,\nwhich form favourable reservoirs for underground water.\nAlluding to the immediate topography of the ground experimented upon\n(E, Fig. 1), it is situated on the south-eastern slope of Carrigoona Hill, adjoin\ning the Commons, that is, the heathery and rocky portion of the hill near its\nsummit. Descending the slope, one observes crags of quartzite jutting up\non either side of a hollow, which is partially filled with drift of the character\ndescribed above. The south-eastern drainage of the hill would naturally\nin part flow along this hollow, and would rapidly disappear, were there\nno drift. The drift, however, intercepts the drainage, and would merely\nretard its flow were it quite porous in texture ; but it is comparatively\nimpervious, with the exception of the sand and gravel layers ; and whatever\ndrainage-water percolates through, reaches and is retained by the layers,\nwhich consequently are ready sources of supply when tapped.. These are\nalmost horizontal, probably dipping more or less from the sides towards the\ncentre, and somewhat basin-shaped when spreading to any extent over the\narea occupied by the field. Hence, when such a stratum is pierced, the water\nrises to a height in the boring corresponding to its head in the basin-shaped\nlayer\u2014higher than the layer at its centre ; and practically to the same height\nin borings which tap the same source\u2014as in the case of the two successful\nborings with which we are concerned here.\nJudging, then, from geological data, the nature of the ground would\nsuggest as the most promising site for a water-boring, a point, say, midway\nbetween the quartzite crags\u2014perhaps a little nearer to the western crag\nthan the eastern, say 40 yds. from the former and 60 from the latter. The\nsuccessful borings [Nos. 1 and 3] have, on the dowser's advice, been put\ndown some 22 yds. from the west side of the field (lying immediately\nbetween the crags) and some 70 yds. from the east side.\nIt is very improbable\u2014at least, very difficult to understand\u2014that a\nmerely casual visitor to the place, however shrewd, if not versed in\ngeological facts, could divine the existence of water in the field by a\ncursory inspection, much less indicate with any accuracy the spot and\ndepth at which it would be found. The success attending the experiment\nhere .is rendered the more striking by the dowser's additional prediction\nthat water would not be found in the other field at the west side of\nCarrigoona (W, Fig. 1) ; though, to the ordinary observer, there would\nappear to be at least as much probability of finding a supply in this\nplace as in the one above described. j j^ Xilroe.\n\f160 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nMr. Kilroe s opinion is all the more valuable as he is a recognised\nauthority on the \" drift,\" and it will be seen, from the last sentence in\nhis interesting and full report, that he regards the dowser's prediction\nas very curious and remarkable, and, a fortiori, still more striking\nas having been given before any knowledge of the nature and slope of\nthe underlying ground had been obtained.\nFor my own part, I do not think geological knowledge, nor even\nobservation of the rocks of the neighbourhood, has anything to\ndo with the dowser's success. If a plausible explanation is to be\nfound, it is much more likely to be in the impression made upon\nthe dowser by some surface indications of water. This impression\nmay be an entirely subconscious one, and probably is more effective\nwhen it is so, and it ultimately evokes the involuntary motion given\nto the twig: for it certainly is involuntary\u2014a purely reflex action\u2014in\na genuine dowser.\nAlthough there were absolutely no indications of water in the\nexperimental field, E, Fig. 1, yet on the way up to it there is a small\nspring (marked S in the map, Fig. 1) emerging from the rock,\nand flowing over the grass beside the road. This spring is not\nderived from the field, but comes from quite another direction,\nthough a casual observer could not tell this.1 A little beyond\nthere is also evidence of some feeble springs.2 Mr. Stone may\nhave rapidly, and more or less unconsciously, perceived all that I\nhave described, and when he traversed the field his subconscious\nself may have made good use of this information, and drawn a very\nhappy but accidental conclusion therefrom. It could hardly have been\nhis conscious self, for he was talking to me of other matters all\nthe time, and appeared quite as astonished as I was when the twig\nforcibly leapt up and twisted round as he crossed the dotted line\non Fig. 3. There was a barely perceptible contraction of the\nmuscles of the hand when the twig thus vigorously turned ; the\nmovement is one that I never yet found any one able consciously to\nimitate without a good deal more visible muscular exertion. But\nthat matter I will refer to again later on.\nAs regards Experiment II., where it will be remembered no water\nwas found, there is in one corner of the field a hole some 6 ft. deep,\nwith the d\u00e9bris from it lying about. This hole is quite dry, and, of\ncourse, the nature of the surface-soil can be seen from the sides of the\n1 There is a famous spring, known as Silverwell, that gushes out of the quartzite\nrock at the foot of the Great Sugarloaf Mountain, about a quarter of a mile further\nup the Rocky Valley ; it is marked S' in Fig. 1.\n2 Which probably have their origin in the outcrop of the layer of sand shown in\nFig. 9 ; but this is not obvious, as the turf at the spot is simply swampy, and a\nstretch of dry ground intervenes between this spot and the field.\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 161\nhole and the d\u00e9bris, which consists of shingle and rocky d\u00e9bris. Mr.\nStone passed sufficiently near the hole to have examined it if he wished\nto, but he seemed to pay not the least attention to it. Again, however,\nthis dry hole may have been the means of setting his subconscious\nself to work, and have led to the result already described. It would,\nhowever, have been an unsafe induction from any conscious process of\nreasoning, for the boring No. 5 revealed quite a different material\nbeneath the surface from that in the hole and in No. 4 boring, which\nwas on the same level as the hole.\nI have now placed on record all the information about these\nexperiments which my geological friends and careful observation have\nenabled me to obtain, and I leave the matter to the judgment of each\nreader.\n\u00a7 2. Experiments at Kingstown.\nExperiment IV.\nWhen Mr. Stone was in Ireland he came to Kingstown, and I asked\nhim to see if he could find any underground water in the De Vesci\ngrounds which are in front of my house. This place had already formed\nthe subject of experiment, see Part XXXII., p. 175. Though I did\nnot inform Mr. Stone of this fact, he might possibly have read of it in\nthe previous Report, and hence I do not attach much, if any, value\nto this experiment, though, even assuming he had a vague recollection\nof the plan given in the former Report, it would have been of very\nlittle service to him. Referring to that plan (p. 175) the site of a\ndisused well is marked : it is entirely concealed beneath the lawn, and\nonly one or two persons know of its existence. The rod moved\nvigorously directly Mr. Stone passed over this spot, and he asserted a\nspring existed below, which he traced across the gravel path to the\ncentre of the wood marked \"shrubbery\" on the plan; here, he\ndeclared, a plentiful supply of water would be found. To fix the\nplace a snap-shot photograph was taken of Mr. Stone at this moment,\nsee next page. Mr. J. H. Jones also tried the sameplace before he\nvisited Carrigoona with me, and he, too, from the prompt motion of\nthe \" rod,\" fixed on a spot very close to that selected by Mr. Stears and\nMr. Stone. There is no doubt water does exist below this spot, at no\ngreat depth ; but whether it is generally diffused surface-water or not\n1 have no means of knowing. There is a famous ever-flowing spring\non a lower level not far from the grounds, but this was unknown to\nthe dowsers. More to the point is the fact that by careful observation\none can see a very slight circular depression on the evenly-covered\nsward, where the mouth of the well once existed.

The \" oldest inhabitant \" knew\nnothing of this watercourse (for it was not a mere surface drain), and apparently led\nto the old well which is supposed to be there.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 163\nwas flowing through them, and he at once consented to try the\nexperiment in my presence. I therefore asked him to come into my\ngarden, under the surface of which ran a water pipe, and tell me when\nthe water was running or not. In the present case a water tap was\nturned on and off at the back of the house, completely out of ear-shot\nof Stone, who was in the front, and a system of signals was arranged\nso that I knew when the water was or was not running ; the signals\ncould not be seen by Stone, nor would he have known their meaning.\nAs the house water supply comes through the buried garden pipe,\nwhen the tap was turned on at the back a flow of water was at once\nset up in the garden pipe. The result of this experiment showed that\nthe number of times Stone proved to be right was very little different\nfrom the number given by pure chance coincidence. Hence this\nexperiment, so far as it goes, was adverse to the dowser's belief that\nhe could detect whenever water was running in a pipe.1 The elder\nMullins, now dead, was often successful, I am informed, in a similar\nexperiment, though I do not know what precautions were taken ;\nexcept in the case narrated by my friend Master Bruce, and given\non p. 83 of the previous Report, and in the experiment by Mr.\nFinch-Hatton given in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 102 ; but a good\nmany instances of success, under strict conditions, would be required\nto be at all conclusive. A series of experiments of this kind were,\nhowever, tried a century ago, with the famous French dowser Bleton,\nand the results were certainly very remarkable (see p. 269).\nThis ended my experiments with Mr. Stone, and I have to thank\nhim for his ready courtesy in submitting to any test I wished, not only\nwithout fee, but at some inconvenience to himself, as he put 'off an\nengagement in England in order to stay a night in Kingstown at my\nrequest. I intended to have tried blindfolding him and taking him\nover the same ground the following day, but neither he nor I could\nspare another day just then ; he promised, however, to submit himself\nto that test when I or any friend could carry it out, either in England\nor over here. An account of a successful experiment of this kind with\nMr. Stone is given in Part V., p. 210.\n1 The pipe was only a small leaden one, about j in. bore. The experiment U each\na very simple one, and precautions to avoid misleading inferences can so easily be\ntaken, that I hope some of our members may be induced to test any dowser in their\nneighbourhood who may be willing to try. I should be grateful for any information\non this point. Care must, of course, be taken that no other taps are turned on in the\nhouse whilst the experiment is in progress, and that no sound of the running water,\neither in the pipe or from the tap, reaches the dowser.\no 2\n\f164 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nPART III.\nCases where the Dowser found a Good Supply op Underground\nWater near to a useless Well or Boring previously\nsunk to as great or greater depth.\nNo. 1. The Sha7iklin Experiments.\nWithout multiplying the evidence needlessly, I will now give a few\nmore cases that have reached me where a useless well or boring having\nbeen sunk without the aid of the dowser, the latter found a good supply\nof underground water hard by, and at a less depth. Some forty cases of\nthis kind were given in the previous Report ; and although at first\nsight such cases appear to afford strong evidence of some supernormal,\nor at any rate some peculiar, faculty possessed by the dowser, a critical\ninvestigation on the spot reveals that this conclusion is unwarranted\nin many cases. Assuming that the dowser has a keen eye and con\nsiderable experience in his business, such successes could often be\nexplained by shrewd guesses on his part. Most geologists who have\nso far overcome their prejudices as to believe the dowser may, to\nsome extent, be an honest man, would explain all his successes in\nthis way, attributing them to a conscious exercise of his power of\nobservation. For my own part, I venture to disagree : the geologist\nspeaks from his own experience, and rarely has he seen a dowser at\nwork or investigated the evidence on his behalf. It is certainly not\nby a conscious exercise of his powers of observation that the dowser\nusually succeeds ; sub-conscious observation and interpretation of\nsurface indications there may be, and doubtless often is\u2014we may\ncall this instinct if we like. The question before us is, can we stretch\nthis explanation to cover the whole ground ?\u2014for we are bound first to\nexhaust every known or possible explanation. To enable the reader\nto arrive at the geological evidence in the cases I am about to cite,\nI am greatly indebted to my geological friends, Mr. E. Westlake,\nF.G.S., and Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S. The former has in several\ncases conducted a critical investigation on the spot, and the latter has\nin many cases appended valuable geological notes.\nIn the previous report (Proceedings S. P. R., Vol. XIII., p. 60)\na brief account is given of the success of two amateur dowsers at\nShanklin, in the Isle of Wight. Subsequently I visited the spot and\nobtained fuller particulars at first-hand. As the case seemed one\neminently worthy of careful geological investigation, I requested Mr.\nWestlake, F.G.S., to make an independent examination and report.\n\fxxxvni.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 165\nAccordingly he did so, and the accompanying able report which he\nhas drawn up is the result of his inquiries.\nReport by E. Westlake, F.G.S.\nOn visiting the Isle of Wight in 1897 at Professor Barrett's\nrequest, for the purpose of examining the cases at Wootton and\nArreton, criticised in the columns of Nature, I took occasion to\ninquire into some experiments at Shanklin, cited on p. 60 of his\nformer paper, which were exceptional as having been made by mem\nbers of the Local Board, who were themselves the dowsers. I found\nthat, though three or four eminent geologists had been previously\ncalled in, they had altogether failed to find water, while the three\ndowsers had been as uniformly successful. As the strata at the point\nin question are as well known to geologists as any in England, this\nresult was rather unexpected, and I have therefore taken some pains\nto get at the circumstances. After visiting the place on four\noccasions, and through the kindness of Mr. Milman Brown, the\nChairman of the District Council (who has revised this account),\nand others concerned, I am now able to give the main particulars,\nwhich to make intelligible I will preface by a few words on the\ngeological situation.\nThe Shanklin reservoirs are in the Gault Clay a mile south of the\ntown, at the sources of the small stream which issues in the Chine.\nThe collecting ground is the southern mass of the Chalk and Upper\nGreensand, the water issuing at the base of the latter where it rests\nupon the Gault. The valley is a right-angle facing the north and\neast, due to the main joints in the Greensand, which run E. and W.\nand N. and S. The dip of the strata is 1 in 45 (1 \u00a3\u00b0) south. Along\nthe sides of the valley the Greensand has a local inward dip of from\n2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0, due to the slipping out of its base upon the Gault, forming\nfissures which increase in size as they descend. On account, however,\nof the tendency of the water to run southwards, the valley is un\nfavourably situated for springs, and on its sides one only has been\nutilised, viz., on the south side just below the top cottage, The Retreat ;\nthe remainder are in the copse at the head of the valley.\nGreatwood Copse, the scene of the water-finding, occupies a semi\ncircular hollow a quarter of a mile wide at the angle of the valley.\nThe effect of this hollowing is that the Greensand, which extends for\na quarter of a mile to the north, obtains in the copse a slight southern\nface traversing the fissures aforesaid, and it is here that the springs\ntake their rise. The well (to be described presently) which was sunk\nat a spot indicated by J. Mullins, the late famous dowser, is placed in\nthis southern face\u2014the very best place, geologically speaking, i.e., on\n\f166 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nthe above theory that the main supply comes from the north-east corner\nof Shanklin Down. As the consumption of water in the town has been\ncontinually increasing (in 1898 it was about 50,000 gallons a day),\nwhile the supply has never been large (about 40,000 gallons in Septem\nber, 1898), there have been continual efforts to augment it, which, as\nfar as they relate to our inquiry, are as follows :\u2014\nThe first wells in the copse, Mr. Brown informed me, were sunk in 1875\nby the London engineers, Messrs. Quick. The east well, 150 yards west of\nthe road, is 55 feet deep, and held (September, 1898) 9 feet of water ; its\ncover is 411 feet above Ordnance Datum (i.e., above sea-level). The west\nwell, 20 yards further in, is 420J feet O.D., and 65J feet deep, with 10 feet\nof water. There is thus a difference of only 1 foot in the bottoms of the\nwells. They are connected by a sub-water heading so as to form virtually\none well, and by a middle heading for syphoning purposes, the floor of\nwhich averages 383 feet U.D. They supply, I am informed by Mr. E. C.\nCooper, the town surveyor, about 4,000 gallons a day. The water, when\nsyphoned, stood (September, 1898) at 366 feet O.D. When not syphoned\nit stood (December, 1899) at 382 feet O.D. ; in winter it rises till it over\nflows the outer sill of the middle heading at 388 feet O.D.\nThe upper heading, which is close by, was driven without expert advice\nabove a wet place in the copse, and followed the water in a westerly direction\nfor a distance of from 400 to 500 feet. This heading starts at a level of 401\u00a3\nfeet O.D., at a point 15 yards west of the middle heading and IS feet above\nit. (See Fig. 12.)\nAbout 1878 Mr. H. Bristow, F.R.S., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey,\nwas consulted by the Board, and visited the spot. On his advice the upper\nheading was extended to a point about 900 feet west of the entrance\ndirectly under the old chalk pit on Shanklin Down, but without getting any\nappreciable addition to the flow of water. When I measured it in December,\n1899, the quantity was 9,000 gallons a day, which, however, is below the\naverage ; the turncock, Mr. Whittington, said when the flow was good it was\ndouble this. That hardly any water was found in Bristow's extension is\nprobably due, as pointed out by Mr. Topley, F.R.S., in a subsequent report,\nto its having been driven \" at too high a level \" ; \" water,\" he adds, \"might\nbe found by a well or boring at the far end, but would probably not rise into\nthe heading.\"\nIn 1885 the Board consulted two other geologists, Mr. W. Topley,\nF.B.S., of the Geological Survey, whose report in May of that year I have\njust cited, and Mr. Mark Norman, author of a geological guide to the Isle of\nWight, but their schemes of sinking to the Lower Greensand were not only\ncostly but problematical.\nIn 1893, as a last resort, the Board called in Mr. John Mullins, the\nwell-known Wiltshire dowser, who marked several spots in the field to the\nsouth of the reservoirs, but the conditions were too onerous for them to sink\nthere. On their own land, however, by the S. W. corner of the upper\nreservoir, which was from 50 to 100 yards to the north of Mullins' marks,\nthey sank a well 30 feet deep, but without getting water. Then they got\nMr. Parsons, the Brading harbour-master, to bore at the bottom of the well\n\fXXXVIII.] 167\n0*1 the So-called Divining Rod.\n-,Shftfti'lin\n-.\n^o*\n<5\nWELLQ.8--\n\"4,\n%2 r ft*\n\/ (jreatwo\nwell0* Q<y?V2bfl ^i^\nFio. 11.\nFrom the 35 in.

Mr. Thorn, of Manchester, continued the\nboring from 200 to 300 feet deeper into the Lower Greensand, but after\ndiminishing the bore from 8 to 4 inches the Board refused to sanction a\nfurther reduction and the boring was abandoned. The borehole is now\ndisconnected. The well has a supply from surface soakage of from 400 to\n800 gallons a day, which is not used. I may remark on the foregoing that\nMullins' marks, being on the outcrop of the Upper Greensand, offered a\nreasonable prospect for finding water, whereas the site chosen for the well at\na level of 373 feet O.D., being on solid Gault clay, could have only a little\nfrom surface percolation.\nIn 1895 the Board consulted Mr. A. Strahan, F.G.S., of the Geological\nSurvey (who had re-surveyed the district), on the prospect of obtaining\na supply by a deep boring on the same site. In his report of September of\nthat year he says, \"I do not think there is a more favourable site, from a\ngeological point of view, in the immediate neighbourhood.\" His plan, like\nthat of Messrs. Topley and Norman, was to sink some 400 to 700 feet, and\npump from the Ferruginous Sands below the sea-level; \"but this,\" said\nMr. Brown, \" would have cost us a great deal, and he could not promise us\nanything certain when we got there.\"\nReturning to Mullins' operations, it appears that after he came, early in\n1893, two members of the Board, Messrs. Brown and Bailey, who had found\nthe twig turn in their hands, started dowsing in the copse on their own\naccount. They each found the twig turn at certain places nearly coincident ;\none of these places they found to be the same spot previously fixed upon by\nMullins. At this spot (No. 1, see map, Fig. 11) they sunk a well 26 feet\ndeep, and at two points of their own (Nob. 2 and 7) they sank wells 28 feet\nand 64 feet deep. Though No. 1 is only 100 yards to the north of the\nheadings and No. 2 only 40 yards south, a good supply of water was found\nin the three wells. No. 1 supplied, at first, 7,000 gallons a day ; No. 2,\nabout 10,000 gallons. No. 7 required, at first, nine days to pump it out ;\nat the present time, however, it only supplies about 2,000 gallons a day.\nIn 1895, again following the twig's indications, they sank four more wells\n(Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6), in all of which water was found. Nos. 3 and 4 have\nsupplied from 1,500 to 2,000 gallons a day. No. 5, when dug, had 2 feet of\nwater which ran freely, but has since failed. No. 6 (72 feet deep) has not\nbeen connected to the reservoir. These additional supplies, though quite\ninadequate for a growing town, had, said Mr. Brown, kept them going for\nthe time being. The height of the ground at these wells (Nos. 1 to 7) I\nfound, by levelling from St. John's Church, to be 415, 415, 413, 419\u00a3, 447A,\n465 and 466 feet O.D. All the wells are now covered over, except No. 7,\nbut I have ascertained their respective depths to be, approximately, 26, 28,\n28, 30, 33, 72 and 64 feet ; their bottoms are, therefore, approximately, 389,\n387, 385, 389J, 414\u00a3, 393 and 402 feet O.D. Hence, except in No. 5, the\nwater lies at levels between the middle and upper headings, showing the\ndowsed water to come from the same stratum as that in the othor wells and\nheadings. In No. 7 the water stands at 416J feet O.D., so that the ex\nhaustion of No. 5 is probably due to its not having been sunk deep enough.\n\fXXXVIII.] 169\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nThe geological position of Parson's well is in the Gault clay, which\nis penetrated after the first 100 feet, the remainder of the boring being\nin the sandstones of the Lower Greensand (Neocomian). Quick's wells\nand the middle heading are in the passage-beds between the Gault and\nUpper Greensand, which pass into one another insensibly. The upper\nheading is mostly in the Upper Greensand, the base of which, according\nto the Geological Survey, is a little below the path in the copse, and\ncoincides nearly with the 400 feet contour. The dowsed wells start in\nthe Upper Greensand, and, except No. 5, penetrate to the passage-beds.\nGift\nFio. 12.\nDiagrammatic Section through Greatwood Copse : vertical scale (exaggerated twice)\n208 feet to one inch.\nThe dowsers' wells, shown by dotted lines, are numbered as in Fig. 11.\nParson's boring extends to double the depth shown in the above diagram.\nTabulating the results obtained by the professionals and dowsers\nrespectively, we have :\u2014\nEngineers' and Geologists' Results.\nSupply when good.

Thus, for comparison with the engineers' total, the dowsers'\nfirst total is too large, and the second too small. To compare the\nwater found by them respectively, we ought properly to have figures\neither for all the first flows, or for some time when the springs were\nhigh enough to get flows from all the wells. Mr. Cooper writes\n(July 11th, 1900): \"I think if you put the value of the [dowsers']\nwells at their best as a third the value of the headings, you will then\nbe stating their [relative] value very fairly.\" According to this\nestimate, and taking the amount of excavation into account, the\ndowsers obtained nearly twice as much water per foot as the other\nwater-finders. Of the success of the latter, five-sixths was due to\nempirical means, one-sixth to the engineers, and none to the geologists\nwho went either above or below the proved water-bearing bed. The\ndowsers on the other hand went straight to the point by putting their\nwells into the water-bearing bed itself.\nThe relative professional failure, however, does not entitle the\ndowsers' results to pose as mysterious. The top of the Gault is typically\nwater-bearing : the well-known landslip at East End, a mile or two\ndistant, is due to the water in this very bed, the level of which in the\ncopse was known from Quick's two wells. The probability, therefore,\nof some water at this horizon no geologist would doubt. What they\ndid doubt was whether a useful quantity would be found in the copse\nby driving or sinking at haphazard : thus in his report Mr. Topley says,\nalluding to Mr. Bristow's attempt, \" Galleries have been driven into\nthe Upper Greensand for the purpose of intercepting springs . . . and\nI cannot recommend any further experiments in this direction.\" The\nsubsequent experiments of the dowsers, introducing ex hypotliesi a new\nmethod of discovery, do not throw light on the problem of haphazard\nsinking, except in so far as the doubtful utility of wells Nos. 5 and 6\ntends to show that a useful quantity of water is not to be met with\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 171\neverywhere. The results of the experiments may be considered under\ntheir (1) qualitative and (2) quantitative aspects :\u2014\n(1) The finding of some water in all the dowsers' wells if claimed\nas evidence for dowsing involves the assumption that water could not\nbe found everywhere by sinking into the passage beds. Between this\nand the geological deduction that it probably could, there is no direct\nevidence to decide. Quick's wells, though supporting the geological\nview as far as they go, are close together, and inadequate for com\nparison with the dowsers' seven distributed over the copse.\n(2) The 50 per cent, superiority of the seven dowsed wells\nassumes that Quick's wells represent the average of as many trials by\nordinary methods ; granting this, the superiority seems too slight to\nexclude accident. In support of the dowsers' opinion that they had a\nfaculty for pitching on the right places, Mr. Brown mentioned that in\none or more wells they came on loose rubble like that filling the\nfissures in the adjoining quarries, which made him think they had hit\non a \"vent\" (water-bearing fissure) : this was confirmed by Mr. Young,\nthe sinker of wells Nos. 2 and 7. Failing an examination of the wells\nat the time, we can now only judge of the extent of this feature from\nits probable consequences in an increased supply, so that it does not\nadd to the evidence. Hence the dowsers' success cannot I think be\npressed in either aspect, for want of proper terms of comparison.\nThere remains the broad result that for equal amounts of work\nthe dowsers got twice as much water as the engineers, while the\ngeologists got hardly any. As regards surface signs of water in the\ncopse I did not notice any in relation to the dowsed wells, and have\ngiven the dowsers the benefit of assuming there were none. But the\nabsence of a reason for digging somewhere in particular may lead to\ndigging nowhere, and in such cases the rod may succeed by supplying\na motive for digging. The sceptic may urge, \" the dowser turns the\ntwig and fortune does the rest.\" We see, however, that geological\nexplanations of dowsers' successes do not necessarily show that the\ngeologists would have found the water themselves.\u2014E.W.\nNo. 2. The Errol Case.\nThe following case is of interest, as it was first published in the\ncolumns of one of the leading engineering journals, The Engineer, for\nOctober 8th, 1897, after an editorial note on the Divining Rod. The\nwriter of the accompanying letter to The Engineer is a member of a\nwell-known engineering firm in Perthshire :\u2014\nErrol Works, Errol, Perthshire, October 1st, 1897.\nReferring to your article on the above subject, as you say of your\nself, \" There was no one in the world more anxious to believe that these\n\f172 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\ndivinations were hoaxes than I was.\" The worst of it is, they will keep on\nsucceeding. I will give you my own experience. A. gentleman in this\nparish\u2014Mr. Clark, of Taybank\u2014started above where he thought he would\nget water. He went down, I think, over 460 ft., and got none. He heard\nof a water-finder, now deceased\u2014Mullins by name. Of course, he did not\nbelieve in him, but thought he would give him a trial. A lot of folks turned\nout to see him, amongst them the Rev. Robert Graham, LL.D. My father\nand I were also present. I was quite sure there was nothing in it. Mullins\nwas first taken to the bore Mr. Clark had in progress. He was not told it\nwas a failure. He was taken over it with his V-shaped hazel twig, and\nasked how much water would be got there. He said, \" You may go down\nhundreds of feet, and you will not find any water.\" He\u2014Mullins \u2014 dis\ncovered water not fifty yards from this bore. He indicated its course, and\nmarked it by pegs driven into the ground. He told Mr. Clark if he went\ndown 40 ft. to 50 ft. he would get so many gallons of water, and, if what\nhe said was not true, he would pay for the digging of the well. Mr. Clark\ndug it, and got the supply named at the depth stated. Mullins held the\nends of the V-shaped twig in his hands\u2014an end in each hand\u2014firmly.\nWhenever he came over running water the twig turned round and\nround, and, if held long enough, the twig twisted till it broke. When\nMullins had the twig in his hands, he more than once allowed me and\nanother party to take an end each, where the twig projected past his hands.\nWe held on as hard as we could, and with the turning of the V part of the\nhazel twig, it was twisted till it hung by the bark. Yet another proof. I\ntook the V-shaped wand in my hand, and passed it over running water\nwithout any result. Mullins laid his hands on my wrists, and grasped them\nfirmly, when the twig instantly began to turn, and continued turning till he\nremoved his hands. He never touched the twig while it was in my hands.\nWhatever folks may say to the contrary, there is something in it. \" Facts\nare chiels that winna ding, and darna be disputed.\"\nDuncan A. Morton.\nIn reply to my inquiries Mr. Morton writes :\u2014\nErrol Works, Errol, Perthshire, October llth, 1899.\nYours of 9th inst. came duly to hand. I regret that I never replied to\nyours of October 14th, 1897. As I have not much time at my disposal, I\nwill reply as briefly as I can to your queries. Before Mullins came, Mr.\nClark had made a bore 430 ft. deep, and got little or no water, and that little\nhe did get was bad and generally supposed to come from some drains or\nsomething of the kind. Mullins came and was taken over the bore with his\nrod, and said, \" You can go down a thousand feet and you will not find any\nwater there.\" He discovered a spring at once 100 yards from the bore at a\ndepth of 40 ft.\u2014an abundant supply of good water\u2014first-rate water, indeed.\nMr. Clark uses it yet, though there is a district supply now ! Mullins said\nwater would be got at a depth of 35 ft. to 40 ft., and if not, he would pay\nfor the digging of the well.\nI was as determined against the rod as any man alive till I saw it, but I\ncould not shut my eyes to facts.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 173\nI took the V-shaped hazel wand in my hand, and passed over where\nMullins said there was running water. The twig never moved, but when\never Mullins grasped my wrists the twig turned round and round till it\nbroke and hung by the bark. I explained all this in my letter to the\nEngineer, October, 1897.\nI saw Mr. Clark, of Taybank, last night, and he gave me the particulars.\nMullins indicated the course of the running water, and we put in pegs, and\nthey just looked like (in an uneven line) the wriggling of a stream, and came\nout right in line on the face of the rising ground with a drain which Mr.\nClark had made, and which he said cut through a stream of water.\nI shall be glad to reply to any further inquiries from you.\nDuncan A. Morton.\nI have also heard much to the same effect from Mr. Clark, and, in\na subsequent letter, Mr. Morton informs me he has, at my request,\nseen Mr. Clark again, and sends me the following additional par\nticulars. The exact depth of the useless boring was 432 ft. This\nbore first went through a stiff blue clay or marl, turning to red\nwhen deeper ; the water that was eventually obtained was insufficient\nand not good. Mullins' well was dug 40 ft. and then bored to a total\ndepth of 80ft., when the water rose to within 12 ft. of the surface;\nin spite of very dry weather and continual use it has never fallen\nbelow 17 ft. from the surface. It was the old Mullins, now dead, who\nwas employed.\nMr. Holmes' geological comment on this case is as follows :\u2014\nLooking at the general geological map of Scotland by Geikie, I find Errol on\nthe \" Old Red Sandstone \" Series. The beds pierced in the deep boring were,\nhowever, it is said, clay or marl. (It may be worth remarking that a name\nsuch as Old Bed Sandstone only implies a series of rocks of a certain relative\nage in which red sandstone is the predominant rock.) Of course clay and\nmarl are not likely to give a decent water supply at any depth. But close to\nErrol come the alluvial deposits of the Carse of Gowrie, and these (or any\nother alluvial deposits) would give a fiat surface, contrasting in the most\nmarked way with ground where Old Red Sandstone formed the surface beds,\nand might furnish a good supply of water at 35 ft. or less. I don't know\nthe place, but the rough diagram below will explain the general difference. If\nthe river Tay ran through soft clay, the slopes outside the river deposits\nwould be more gentle in contour than would be the case with harder rocks,\nbut the practised eye would hardly fail to distinguish between slope and flat\nwhether on the Tay, the Trent or the Thames. T V H\nThe diagram showing the conjectured geological section, which Mr.\nHolmes kindly adds to his note, is not reproduced, as it is of course\nonly a conjecture. I should be extremely obliged if any of my readers\nin Perthshire would make further geological inquiries into this case, as\nit is evidently one of considerable interest. It will be remembered\nthat it was old John Mullins who was the dowser in the famous\n\f174 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nWaterford case, which was so fully discussed in the previous Report.\nThe useless bore in that case was over 1,000 ft., and there were\nabsolutely no surface indications to guide him.\nNo. 3. The Lytes Cary (Somerset) Case.\nThe following is a very interesting case. The dowser, in this\ninstance, was an amateur, the late Mr. E. M. Hippisley, a leading\nsurveyor and land agent in \"Wells, Somersetshire, who was singularly\nsuccessful as an amateur dowser (see p. 216). In a paper on his own\nexperiences in dowsing that he read at the Bishop's Palace, in Wells,\nin April, 1892, he stated :\u2014\nAt Lytes Cary [near Kingsdon, Taunton] there is an interesting old\nEnglish house with a chapel in good preservation, which, with some\nmodern [farmhouse] buildings, enclose a large courtyard. I found [by\ndowsing] on the south side near the garden, indications of water, and had a\nwell sunk 25 ft. deep, in which the water rises to within 13 ft. of the surface,\nand here a singular incident occurred. During the past year part of the\npaving on the opposite side of the yard gave way, when an old well was\ndiscovered 45 ft. in depth, but no water in it, and only 30 ft. from the\nnew well.\nMr. Westlake kindly went over to Lytes Cary and made a careful\nexamination of the surroundings, and of the geological conditions as\nwell as the facts of the case. He reports to me as follows :\u2014\nMay, 1900.\n\" Lytes Cary is in the southernmost bend of the river Cary, in\nSomersetshire. The farmhouse is in the occupation of Messrs. Porter\nand Porter, who aided my inquiries in every way. I was first shown\nthe sites of the wells, both quite covered over and concealed ; they are\nabout 40 ft. apart. The old well was carefully built, and is 60 ft. deep\n(not 45 ft., as Mr. Hippisley thought) so I was informed by the\nestate builder, who had measured it himself. He told me also that\nHippisley's well is 25 ft. deep, sunk in the marl all the way down, and\nthe sides are strong enough to stand without masonry.1 It still con\ntinues to give an abundant supply to the house, and contained 9 ft. of\nwater when last opened. There are also three other wells on the N.\nand W. of the premises, about 190, 140, and 80 ft. distant from\nHippisley's well ; one of them, the furthest off, is 22 ft. deep, and\nyields a small supply of \" suspicious \" water ; the second, which once\ncontained a few feet of foul water, has been filled up ; and the third\nwas long ago abandoned and used as a cesspool.\n\" The farm premises are all on level ground. The strata at the\nfarm, according to the geological survey, are Lower Lias, which, as\n1 This does not necessarily show the strata were different.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 175\nseen in quarries about a mile to the north, consists of the usual thin\nlimestones with partings of marl, and has little permeability except in\nthe vertical joints. The beds at the farm appear to underlie the\nabove, but there are no surface indications, geological or otherwise, to\nshow that water is more likely to be found at one spot than another.\nHad the existence of the old well been known a geologist would have\nbeen chiefly concerned to avoid its proximity. In finding water so\nnear it Mr. Hippisley certainly achieved the improbable, though, as\nagent for the estate, he was thoroughly acquainted with the place,\nexcept the existence of the old dry well, which had been lost sight of\nby all. A characteristic of the Lower Lias is to hold water in unsus\npected fissures. This places the hydro-geologist at a disadvantage,\nand renders this formation a suitable ground for dowsing, or chance\ndiscovery, as the case may be. I have referred to other cases of the\ndowser's success in the Lower Lias in my Report, p. 315.\u2014E. W.\"\nNo. 4. The Sherburn-in-Elmet Case.\nI heard that Mr. Stone had been engaged by the owner of some pro\nperty at Sherburn-in-Elmet, Yorkshire, to find a water supply where a\nwell, over 150 ft. deep, already existed, but had run dry, and that\nStone had predicted by the \" rod \" that an abundant supply would\nbe found less than 50 ft. from the old well at a depth of 60 ft., and\nthat, upon boring, Stone's prediction was verified and a good supply\nobtained. I wrote to the owner of the property, Mr. Lolley, for an\nexact statement of the facts, and had the following reply :\u2014\nNorthfield House, Lovell Road, Leeds, December 6th, 1899.\nIt is quite true we had a well 70 ft. deep; and had bored about 90 or\n100 ft. from the bottom of the well without finding water. The well had\nbeen in use about fifteen years, and always had a good supply until an\nartesian well was sunk in the low-lying part of Sherburn, after which we\nseemed to lose the water.\nSeeing Mr. Stone's testimonials, I applied to him. Mr. Stone visited\nSherburn and said that there was a good supply of water some 60 ft. deep\nbeneath a place he indicated, about 15 yds. from the old well, and on the\nboring being carried out the water teas found at 62 ft. deep.\nWalter Lolley.\nThis case is of interest, and I should be glad of some further\ninformation concerning it, especially of the geological character of\nthe locality. Sherburn-in-Elmet is midway between Leeds and York,\nand Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., informs me it lies near the bottom\nof the slope of the Magnesian Limestone, which here dips down to\nthe Old Red Sandstone that overlies it in the valley. I wrote to\n\f176 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nMr. Lolley to ask if he had kept a record of the strata bored through,\nand he replies :\u2014\nLeeds, December 28th, 1899.\nThe borehole at Sherburn was through limestone and clay, the rock is\nthe \"Magnesian\" limestone, and my property is on the eastern slope of\nthis ; in fact, the lower part of the village further east is on the alluvial\nclay of the Vale of York. The water was found in a layer of gravel and\nclay in the borehole after getting through the limestone.\nWalteb Lolley.\nNo. 5. The Tiddington House (Oxford) Case.\nThe following letter appeared in the Farmer and Chamber of\nAgriculture Journal for October 18th, 1897. The case is interesting\nas the artesian well borers were attempting to bore through the\nOxford clay, whilst the dowser, as in many other cases, evidently found\na permeable surface stratum, of sand or gravel, above the clay.\nTiddington House, Oxford, October, 1897.\nBeing without water for my garden and stable, except what was fetched\nby water cart some distance day by day and caught from rainfall, and this\naltogether unsatisfactory, I experienced a great difficulty in getting a proper\nwater supply, and eventually decided to employ a firm of artesian well borers\nto bore for water for my use in 1883. A spot was decided upon, and a\nboring put down to a depth of 312 ft., which cost me over \u00a3300, and no\nwater whatever was obtained ; all I have for my money is the piece of\nparchment containing the sections of the boring and a few samples of the\nformation. ...\nI engaged Mr. Tompkins to search my property for a water supply\n. . . and instructed him to carefully test my stable yard, as this was the\nsite I was most anxious to find water on. After carefully searching this\nproperty he reported that no water existed there, and that it would be simply\nuseless to attempt to obtain water here. I then informed him of what I had\npreviously done, aud the amount of money I had uselessly spent. Thus the\nwater-finder proved correct in his first test.\nA move was then made into the gardens, and, after going over them, the\nwater-finder reported a stratum of water was running across the corner of the\ngarden, and was an overflow from a spring above. Ho traced up this stratum\nof water. The twig he was using was a white thorn cut in the shape of a V,\nwhich he held by the two prongs apex downwards. As he walked over this\nstratum of water, the twig kept rising in front of him until he came to the\nhead of the spring l in the upper part of the paddock above, when it turned\ncompletely over and over, and so strong was the upward movement of the\nrod that it bent considerably in its frantic endeavour to turn over, and on\nbeing held firmly by the water-finder, it broke off in his hand. Naturally,\nwe were all surprised and astonished at such a remarkable occurrence.\n1 This is an absurd but favourite expression of Mr. Tompkins, who is under the\ndelusion that underground water originates in a reservoir, and that the higher up\nyou trace the \" spring \" the more copious the supply.\u2014W. F. B.\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 177\nI instructed Mr. Tompkins to prepare me an estimate to sink a well four\nfeet diameter in the clear, and to supply and erect a wind engine and storage\ntank. The well was put in hand, and at a depth of 30 ft. water was struck.\nThe well was steined up before sinking deeper, and a strong pump put down\nto keep the water under, and before sinking many feet it became necessary\nto put on seven men to keep the water going. From the inrush of water\nthe bottom men were working up to their knees in water, and the moment\nthe pump and buckets stopped they were in danger of being drowned out.\nThe work proceeded under these circumstances for a week or so, until it\nbecame useless to continue the work owing to the abundance of water ;\n10,000 gallons per day being the yield of the spring at a depth of 37 ft., and\nthis site is at a higher elevation than my stable yard. I cannot speak too\nhighly of Mr. Tompkins' practical success, both as regards his finding water\nand the satisfactory way in whSh he has carried out the work.\nG. W. Bennett.\nIn reply to my inquiries Mr. Bennett confirms the statements in\nhis published letter and adds :\u2014-\nTiddington House, Oxford, October 9th, 1899.\nMy well has never gone dry, neither this summer nor last, though it gets\nlow generally about November or December. The only drawback to the\nwindmill is, I find, we have not always enough wind to pump, and sometimes\nwe are four or five days without wind for pumping for drinking purposes.\nThere are [not] and never have been any wells near where Mr. Tompkins\nfound the water with the divining rod.\nG. W. Bennett.\nMr. Holmes' comment on this case is as follows :\u2014\nOxford stands upon \"Oxford Clay,\" the thickness of which varies from\n300 ft. to 600 ft. (Woodward). But over the greater part of the site the\nOxford clay is covered by gravel, which is usually from 8 ft. to 20 ft. thick.\nAnd gravel on a higher level is often found to cap the plateaux of the\ndistrict. I do not know whether Tiddington House is in or near Oxford.\nThe unsatisfactory boring of 312 ft. was evidently in the Oxford Clay. But\nthe satisfactory supply was evidently from sand and gravel lying above the\nOxford Clay. But the gravel on which Oxford stands is not that deposited\nby the rivers Isis and Cherwell, but is of the higher level and older date.\nWhere in Oxford and its suburbs, between the Isis and Cherwell, the ground\nis covered by a thick mass of superficial sands, gravels, etc., there the ground\nm likely to be higher than where the Oxford Clay is bare. And the contours\nof the ground will tell at once to the practised eye where there is bare clay\nand where there is a gravel-capping above it, or river-gravel at a lower level.\nOf course, if, in this case, the successful sinking had been in the gravel of\nthe Cherwell or Isis, and the house on the Oxford Clay, it would have been\nat a lower level than the house. It appears, however, to have been at a\nhigher level than the house\u2014or at least the stable yard. Gravel seems to\nhave the same way of capping the highest ground in the Oxford Clay\ncountry that it has in the London Clay districts.\nT. V. H.\n\f178 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nMr. Holmes' geological diagnosis of this case is confirmed by the\nfollowing letter, which I received in reply to my inquiry as to any surface\nindications, and as to the nature of the boring and also the distance\napart of the useless boring and Tompkins' well. The sand or gravel\nbed was evidently thicker than intimated by Mr. Holmes, and no doubt\nthe rush of water came when the well-sinkers got close to the under\nlying impermeable clay. All the same, this does not explain how\nTompkins hit on the right spot, for \" the practised eye \" of the well-\nsinkers who put down the useless bore, and that of Mr. Bennett's\ngardener, failed to discover the right spot.\nTiddington House, Oxford, January 3rd, 1900.\nThe Tompkins well is on rather a higher elevation than where we bored\nin 1883, and is quite 160 yards from that boring. The Oxford clay is\ncertainly capped by sandy grit or gravel. We first took off about 3 or\n4 ft. of turf mould ; then went into a red sand which continued some\n25 or 30 ft., when the water came in so fast they could not go on digging\nthe well. To the ordinary eye, no one could possibly have said where to hit\nupon the spring. Mr. Tompkins went backwards and forwards in a zigzag\ncourse with the twig till he came to what he calls \" the fountain head,\"\nwhere he cut a sod out of the turf to show the well-sinkers where to begin\nto dig the well.\nI should say we are about 40 ft. above the level of the river Thames,\nwhich connects with the Isis at Dorchester, Oxon., and there it is called\n\" Thamisis \" or Thames. We are nine miles from Oxford, and nearly two\nfrom the river Thames. Q w Bbnnett.\nNo. 6. The Chelford (Cheshire) Case.\nThe following letter appeared in the Manchester City News for\nOctober 23rd, 1897. The writer is the head of a well-known firm of\nchartered accountants in Manchester.\nBella Vista, Heaton Moor.\nHaving noticed the great amount of controversy that has of late been\nmanifested, together with the number of articles that have appeared in\nvarious contemporaries, on the so called divining rod as a means of discover\ning water supplies, I venture to give you an account of my recent experience\nwith a water-finder and his work.\nHaving had occasion to obtain a new water supply for a house in Cheshire,\nthe opinion of a firm of artesian well borers was obtained. They recommended\nthat at a certain spot an artesian well should be sunk, with the idea of\ntapping a spring of water, and at the same time to have the advantage of an\nartesian well to ensure absolute purity. Accordingly a contract was obtained\nand a well [boring] made, with the hope of finding a supply of water at a\nreasonable depth ; and after several months' work, entailing considerable ex\npense, boring was carried to a depth of about 480 ft. But the long looked for\nsupply of water was not obtained, and after trying for some time to get a\nsupply of water from this deep well, I found that it was almost useless, and\n\fxxxvin.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 179\nin the end had to be abandoned as a failure. I then, for the first time,\nsought the advice of a firm of water-finders who use the divining rod, and\nhaving made an appointment with Messrs. John Mullins and Sons, Colerne,\nBox, Wiltshire, I met a member of their firm on the estate.\nIn the simplest way possible he began to prospect the grounds for what\nhe called a spring, or water-bearing strata. Carrying in his hands a\nV shaped hazel twig, holding the point downwards, with one fork in each\nhand, he began to walk across the lawn, and after walking a distance of\nabout twenty yards he suddenly stopped, with the twig automatically twist\ning in his hands. He declared that here a spring existed at a depth from the\nsurface of not more than 40 ft. To convince me that he could not govern\nthe action of the twig in his hands, he requested me to grip the ends of the\ntwig, and so try to keep it from turning, but in trying to do so I was quite\npowerless. After trying for some minutes to gauge the volume of the\nspring, which he professed to do by the action of the twig, he then gave\nwhat he considered to be the approximate yield of water per day, and pro\nceeded to trace the direction in which the spring was running. Having gone\ninto the kitchen garden, he said the spring was only 10 ft. from the bore\nwhich had previously been made to so great a depth.\nIn order to prove that he had faith in his own method, he asked to be\nallowed to undertake the necessary work, and to obtain the supply of water\nwhich he had predicted, at the same time undertaking that if his predictions\nwere not substantiated, the work done by him would not be charged for. A\ncontract was entered into on these terms. As a result, the well has been\nmade, and, at a depth of 36 ft., a good supply of water has been found. The\nwater is of excellent quality.\nI venture to trouble you wth these facts, because I think that this\nmethod of discovering springs of water deserves to be better known.\nCharles William Nasmtth.\nI wrote to Mr. Nasuiith for some additional particulars and\nreceived the following reply :\u2014\n69, Princess Street, Manchester, June 6th, 1898.\nIn reply to yours of the 31st ult. re the water supply at Mereleigh, Chel-\nford, I have very little to say beyond that which I gave in my letter\naddressed to the Citg News of October 22nd, except that Mullins was quite\na stranger in the neighbourhood, and had no knowledge of the subsoils. He\nfirst found the spring of water on the lawn, and traced its course from the\nlawn to the kitchen garden, and the site he selected for the well was 10 ft.\nfrom the deep bore, and at this site the well has been made, with the result\ngiven in my letter, and the supply is still satisfactory.\nThe subsoil where the spring was found was sand, with about 13 ft.\nof clay on the surface and clay below the level of the spring, but it appears\nthat in the old deep bore it was all clayey.\nNo other authority was previously consulted beyond the firm who did the\nboring. They, I believe, worked by the geological chart of the neighbour\nhood.\nCharles William Nasmith.\n\f180 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt\nMr. Nasmith also sent me a plan of the estate with position of the\nuseless boring and Mullins well, but this adds nothing to the informa\ntion given in his letter. In reply to Mr. Nasmith, the artesian well\nborers, Messrs. Timrains, wrote to the local papers to say that the well\nsunk by Mullins merely yielded surface water and was therefore unsafe\nto use for drinking, that the surface soil was sand and an old disused\nwell sunk in this sand existed close by. Mr. Nasmith, however,\nmaintains that the Mullins well does not yield surface water, but is\nsunk below an impermeable stratum of clay. I submitted the whole\ncorrespondence to Mr. T. V. Holmes, who writes in reply as follows :\u2014\n28, Crooms Hill, Greenwich Park,\nLondon, S.E., June 11th, 1898.\nAs to the discrepancy between the accounts of Timmins and Nasmith as\nto the strata at Chelford, I can offer only the following remarks :\u2014My\nexperience of the sections obtained from well-sinkers and borers is that they\nare extremely careful as to details, and go into more detail than a geologist\nusually would. The well-sinker will not mistake darker-coloured sand, which\nowes its special hue to saturation with water, for clay.\nThen, if we suppose that there were locally 13 ft. of clay at the surface,\nthe water found in both old and new wells evidently came from the same\nsource, the lower part of the sand ; and if the occasional surface clay did not\nprotect the old well from surface pollution, it would not protect the new one.\nAs regards the deep boring, the new red marl would be mainly what\nmight be termed clayey, and its top would probably be not many feet\nbelow the level of the water in the sand.\nI enclose a rough diagram to illustrate the general nature of things.\nThe alternatives as regards water in the district are evidently that you\neither get it from tho surface sand and gravel, or from the new red\nsandstone hundreds of feet below. Any surface clay (supposing it not to\nbe made ground ; see subsoils memoir), being of no practical importance.\nT. V. Holmes.\nIt is clear, therefore, from Mr. Holmes' letter that he regards the\nclay as occurring in patches on the surface and affording no real\nprotection from possible pollution from surface drainage. In reply to\nmy further inquiries Mr. Nasmith informs me that the old condemned\nwell was 18 feet deep, the useless boring is 480 feet deep, whilst the\nnew well, the supply from which he informs me is still \" very satisfac\ntory,\" is 36 feet deep. Chelford is near Alderley Edge in Cheshire.\nShallow wells, certainly, often yield safe potable water, as is seen\nfrom the following letter which I received from the Rev. J. G. Geare\nin reply to my inquiries :\u2014\nFarnham Rectory, Bishops Stortford, May 26\/7i, 1897.\nIn reply I beg to say that Mullins, junr., found on my rectory of three\nacres a splendid spring of good water with his divining twig on September\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 181\n28th, 1893. He found water at less than 20 ft. depth. A boring was made\nand a well (brick) was sunk to 15 ft. depth. The water was analysed, and\nfound good, and since then I have had a bountiful and unfailing supply\nthrough a rotary pump action.\nI may add that Mullins was always correct as to depth to sink a well\nand the best place to bore. His was a first visit, and no test previous to\nhis had been made. j Q GeabEi Recfcor\nUpon which Mr. Holmes remarks :\u2014\nWhether the water from surface beds is wholesome or not depends\nlargely on the density of the population around any given well. Nobody\ncan get water absolutely pure. But the poor geologist would hardly venture\nto recommend surface supplies, for finding which the dowser is hailed as a\nsupernormally gifted benefactor. T V H\nNo. 7. The Welwyn Case.\nThe writer of the next letter is known to Mr. F. W. H. Myers,\nwho kindly sent me the letter.\nThe Node, Welwyn, Herts, October 30M, 1899.\nI sent for a water diviner last summer, as I wanted advice about the\nwater supply here, our well not being satisfactory. When the diviner came\nhe at once found out the direction of the spring supplying my well and\nadvised me to make a heading in a certain direction which he marked, and\nwhich I afterwards carried out, 150 ft. below the surface. The well-sinkers\nfound, before they had carried this heading 6ft., the inrush of water was so\ngreat they had to stop, in spite of a steam engine which kept going night and\nday with powerful pumps.\nAfter trying every device for keeping water out of an accumulator house,\nwhich always seemed to be rising, in spite of a concrete floor 6 in. thick, the\nsame diviner told me exactly where a spring caused the trouble. We tapped\nit from the outside, and now the place is perfectly dry.\nI held one side of the forked rod myself and the \" diviner \" the other, and\nwhen we came to water [alleged underground water] the strain was so great\non my fingers I was obliged to ask him to stop. From the position of the\nrod it was absolutely impossible for him to produce the pressure, which in-\ncreased with the strength of the stream. Montague Price.\nThe last paragraph of this interesting letter I will refer to again\nwhen dealing with the motion of the rod. In reply to my inquiries\nas to the name of the dowser, the geological strata, and whether any\nsurface indications or other wells existed to guide the dowser's choice,\nMr. Price replies as follows : \u2014\nThe Node, Welwyn, Herts, Noeember 7th, 1899.\nAnthony, of Huntingdon, was the \"diviner\" we employed here last\nJune. Nobody knew where the spring came from supplying the well.\n\f182 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nWhen the \"diviner\" arrived, being Saturday afternoon, the workpeople\nhad gone and I certainly did not know where the water came from. I was\nwith him all the time he was here, and he did not go down the well, which is\nover 150 ft. deep.\nThere is no well anywhere near the existing one, and, so far as I know,\nthere was no surface indication to guide the diviner. In fact, he found the\nspring on adjoining property, 50 yards from the well. We drove the heading\nin the well (already existing) 150 ft. below the surface in pure chalk. Other\nsprings he found on my property, but I had no occasion to try them.\nMontague Price.\nMr. Holmes explains this case as follows : \u2014\nIn this case the supply from a well in the chalk 150 ft. deep being\nunsatisfactory, the dowser simply recommended a heading. This is a\ncommon and well-known contrivance in such cases. Water in the chalk,\nthe great water-bearing formation of S.E. England, circulates by the\nlines of bedding and jointing, especially the latter. Where the lines of\njointing are feebly developed the supply of water from the chalk is usually\nfeeble\u2014the permunent saturation leeel being of course reached. The usual plan\nthen is to drive a heading or headings in order to tap additional joint lines ;\none direction being about as good as another. T V H\nMr. Holmes' comment on the geological aspect of this case is that\nthe dowser simply advised doing what a skilled engineer or geologist\nwould recommend. But it must be remembered on the other hand\nthat the dowser probably knew nothing of geology or engineering ; I\ndoubt if he even knew that the well was in the chalk, as he came from\nHuntingdon. Assuming, however, he knew all this, and was a\ngeologist in the bargain, how did he find out the direction in which to\nmake the heading which reached so large a supply \" before 6 ft. \" had\nbeen driven? The Richmond headings1 were driven great distances in\nthe chalk under the advice of the best geologists and engineers, and\nyet to a large extent failed to accomplish their purpose. Was it by a\nmere bit of luck that here, as in many other cases, the dowser\nsucceeded ri\nNo. 8.\nThe next is a letter addressed to Mr. Stone, the dowser, from a\nMr. Stevenitt.\nMinting, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, February 7th, 1898.\nI beg to inform you that I dug a well at the second place marked by you,\nviz., about 20 yds. from the stockyard in grass field, and found water. I\ndug a well 42 ft. deep, so that I should have a good supply for the yard.\nWe have plenty for ourselves and several neighbours, who fetch it regularly\n1 See previous Report, Vol. XIII., p. 195.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 183\nfor drinking purposes. I feel sorry I did not know of you sooner ; it\nwould have saved me something like \u00a3200 in boring 290 ft., where I only\nfound salt water at 135 ft. deep. m \u201e\nI wrote to Mr. Stevenitt, who confirms the above statement and\ntells me the useless bore is only 45 yards from the well. He was for\ntwenty-five years Superintendent of Police in the County Constabulary.\nAs regards this case Mr. Holmes remarks :\u2014\nIn Lincolnshire the gratitude for good water at 42 ft. on the part of Mr.\nStevenitt is most intelligible. May it never be polluted by soakings from\nthe stockyard to any injurious degree.\nT. V. H.\nNo. 9.\nThe next letter is from the Managing Director of the Bermaline\nMakings, Haddington, where Mr. Gataker was the dowser employed.\nWe may state that, previous to our communicating with Mr. Gataker,\nwe had decided to put down an artesian bore at a different part of our\nground. On arrival Mr. Gataker started over the ground at a fair speed\nwith the palms of his hands towards the earth. After proceeding some\ndistance he was able to locate a spring at the end of our new maltings. He\nthen proceeded over a strawberry field belonging to us, and at about 70\nyards from where he located the first spring he located another. He\nguaranteed that from either of those springs we would get a supply of about\n20,000 gallons per day at a depth of from 100 ft. to 150 ft. We put down\na 4 in. bore at the first spring, and are pleased to say that at a depth of 102 ft.\nwe are getting a supply of about 100,000 gallons per day, and the water is\ncoming up with great force. We believe it will rise to about 40 ft. above\nthe surface. We tested it at 13 ft., when it overflowed with a strong\npressure.\nWe challenged the editor and readers of an Edinburgh evening newspaper,\nwho seem to think that water was to be found in any part of our ground,\nto put down a similar bore half-way between the two springs located by Mr.\nGataker in our ground, and if the same quantity of water was found at the\nsame depth we would pay the expense of putting down the bore, and if not\nfound, the party challenging was to pay the expense ; but up to now the\nchallenge has not been taken up by any one.\nIt might interest your readers to know the strata the bore went through,\nand we have much pleasure in enclosing you a copy of the journal, from\nwhich you will see that it was after piercing 14 in. of the fourth layer of\nsandstone that the water was struck, and as soon as the crust of this layer\nwas broken, the water came away with a rushing noise.\nmontoomerie and company (limited),\nJohn Montgombrie,\nManaging Director.\n\f184 Professor W.

[part\nIt is to be regretted this challenge was not accepted, as it would\nhave been a very crucial test, though, from geological considerations,\nwe are disposed to think the newspaper would have won. Mr.\nMontgomerie, however, in his letter to the Edinburgh newspaper,\nstates his reasons for believing that water would not be found \" at\nany part of the valley of the Tyne.\" He says :\u2014\nBermaline Makings, Haddington, January \\ith, 1899.\nDuring the excavations for the new bridge here, there was dug out a\nhole 40 ft. square by 13 ft. deep alongside our mill dam, with only about\n3 ft. of an embankment between the water and the hole. We naturally\nexpected that this hole would be filled up with water rising through the\ngravel bed ; but to our surprise there was not a drop of water came up.\nAny water that found its way into the working came in at the north-east\ncorner\u2014that is, the corner furthest from the river.\nThere is a firm in East Lothian, not far from Haddington, who put down\na bore without calling in the aid of a \" water-finder.\" They have, I believe,\nsunk it to a depth of 660 ft., and, failing to find water, have had to abandon\nthe bore.\nI should be glad of any further information regarding the deep\nbore-hole here mentioned, as neighbouring artesian wells do not\nusually vary like this.\nIn reply to my inquiries Mr. Montgomerie states that his success\nful borehole is about 100 ft. above the sea level ; he sends a \"journal\nof the bore,\" showing the strata passed through. First, 20 ft. of\nsand and gravel, then 6 ft. of boulder clay, followed by 19 ft. of fire\nclay, after that 45 ft. of sandstone and what are called \" faikes \" in\nalternate layers, then 8 ft. of marl, and, finally, sandstone, the depth\nof the bore being nearly 103 ft.\nNo. 10. The Aspley Heath (Bedford) Case.\nThe next case is also one where a deep, unsuccessful bore had been\nmade prior to the dowser's visit. The account here given was pub\nlished in the Midland Counties Herald for April 7th, 1\u00bb98.\nA Bedfordshire gentleman, Mr. Plater, wanted water for his house, so got\na firm to sink a well 60 ft. deep, this being the depth at which it was expected\nwater would be found. However, none was found, and then sinking was\ncontinued to 100 ft. deep, but still without success. A bore was then put\ndown at the bottom of this well a further 66 ft. deep, making a total depth of\n166 ft., but still no water. At Mr. Plater's request a water expert visited\nthe place, and said it was useless to continue working at that spot, for\nno water would be found ; but he felt absolutely confident that by sinking\na well at a spot only 39 ft. from there, there ought to be a plentiful supply\nof water at about 100 ft. or so. Mr. Plater acted on his advice, and at\n116 ft. an abundant supply was found. The old well, although so close,\nis said to be still as dry as a bone.\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 185\nI wrote to Mr. Plater, enclosing the above report, and obtained\nthe following reply :\u2014\nSilver Birch, Aspley Heath, Woburn Sands, R.S.O.,\nOctober 16th, 1899.\nI return the press cutting which was enclosed with your letter to me of\nthe 9th inst.

No further useless wells or borings were made near the successful\nwell.\n3. There is an ample supply of water obtained from the well sunk on\nthe spot indicated by Mr. Gataker.\nI may state that my property at Aspley Heath, Bedfordshire, where the\nwells were sunk in 1896, is about 500 ft. above sea level.\nMr. Gataker stated that water would be found on the spot indicated,\nbut not under 100 ft. from the surface.\nArthur C.

I have lost my record of the strata through which we bored in the\nold well, but to a depth of about 90 ft. sand, with occasional layers of iron\nstone, formed the principal feature ; at about 130 ft. we bored through 6 ft.\nof fuller's earth, and after more sand we bored into the clay several feet,\nand then ceased work. I think the water in the new well is on a bed of\nfuller's earth. The level of the mouth of the new well is about 14 ft. lower\nthan that of the old. The latter is now used as a rainwater tank.\nArthur C. Plater.\nThough I am not a geologist, the explanation of this case appears\nto me simple. The bed of fuller's earth found at a depth of 130 ft.\nin the old well evidently forms the bottom of the new well, which is\n\f186 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\n116 ft. deep and 14 ft. lower level = 130 ft. As fuller's earth (a\nsilicious clay) is a nearly impermeable water bed, when this was pierced,\nas in the old well, the water would escape into the sand below the bed.\nIf the record of the old boring was shown to Mr Gataker, or known to\nhim, the explanation of his successful prediction is also easy ; though\nI have no doubt it would be rejected by all concerned, as dowsers\ntrust more to themselves than to any information given them.\nIt will be seen from the notes which Mr. Holmes and Mr. Westlake\nhave so kindly added to many of these cases, that a geological explana\ntion of why the dowser found water in the places he indicated is clear\nenough. The important point is, would these places have been selected\nby a shrewd observer, or even by a skilled geologist, before the dowser\nhad visited the spot? In some cases this might, as in No. 10, have\nbeen so ; on the other hand a considerable body of evidence exists to\nshow that the dowser, though ignorant of geology and an entire\nstranger to the locality, succeeded, where expert geological or engineer\ning advice, aided by careful local observation, completely failed.\nThose who have taken the trouble to read the previous Report will\nrecall several cases of this kind, notably the Waterford case on\np. 106 et seq., the Horsham case, p. 117 et seq., the Uppingham case,\np. 127 et seq., Sir Welby Gregory's case, p. 96, etc.\nThen again, if merely shrewd observation and considerable\nexperience as well-sinkers afford a sufficient explanation of the\ndowser's success, how are we to explain the achievements of young\ndowsers and other complete novices 1 Take the case of the French\ncharity boy Bleton recorded in Part X, p. 257, or, referring to the previous\nReport, take the cases of the eleven-year-old Cornish lad given on\np. 36, Vol. XIII., or the young daughter of an estate agent given on\np. 33 et seq., or the daughter of an English clergyman on p. 38, or the\nyoung son of another clergyman on p. 39, etc., etc. Then, too, we\nhave other amateur dowsers of all ages and in all ranks of life, whose\nsuccesses in the discovery of underground water certainly appear at\nfirst sight to be greater than mere observation or good luck would\naccount for. Numerous instances of this were given in the previous\nReport, and a few additional cases of successful amateur dowsers, such\nas his Honour Sir Richard Harington, Bart., are quoted later on.\nOne of the four methods suggested by me to test the pretensions\nof the dowser (see p. 251 of last Report) is \"separate and entirely\nindependent examination of the same ground by different dowsers.\"\nThe evidence on behalf of this test I will now proceed to cite.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 187\nPART IV.\nExperiments with Two or More Dowsers Independently Tried\non the Same Ground.\nNo. 1. The Cheltenham Experiments.\nI am indebted to our fellow-worker, Lieut.-Colonel Le M. Taylor,\nof Cheltenham, for the following interesting report of his own and\nother experiments at Cheltenham. It appears that in 1896 the\nDirectors of the Cheltenham Steam Laundry, anxious to obtain a\nsupply of water for the laundry, at Colonel Taylor's suggestion and by\narrangement with him, employed two dowsers, independently of each\nother, to locate the best site whereon to sink a well. Colonel Taylor\narranged first to take Mr. Tompkins to the laundry, and after he had\nfixed on the place or places where water would be found, the laundry\ndirectors were to employ a second dowser and the results were to be\ncompared. The following is an abridged account of the proceedings\ngiven in a local newspaper : \u2014\nA \"diviner\" went over the ground a week or so ago in company with\nseveral of the directors. He subsequently wrote a report which, according\nto an arrangement unknown to the diviner himself, the directors sealed and\nkept strictly secret. As business folk, the directors were not going to trust\nto the decision of one expert, and, therefore, another was engaged to go\nover the ground on Wednesday in company with other directors, who did\nnot know what the result of the former experiment was, in order that there\nmight be no unconscious collusion or \"thought reading,\" Mr. Chesterman,\nof Bath, the chief huntsman on this occasion, seemed to think that his task\nwas none too easy, as it is not always that a reliable supply of water can be\nfound in a small field of clay soil, such as that at the side of the laundry to\nwhich his prospecting was restricted. Taking one of his small, slender\ntwigs, he held it in front of him with his arms lowered and one end of it in\neach hand, so that the angle of the fork pointed very slightly downwards,\nabout three feet from the ground. Thus he commenced to walk slowly in a\nstraight line across the field. Suddenly the twig gave a turn in the\noperator's hands, began to revolve, and continued to do so while he remained\nwithin the area in which he experienced the \"shock\" of water. The two\ndirectors attempted to stay the revolving motion of the twig while the\noperator carried it over the affected area, but though each seized one end of\nit, they could not do so, the ends of the twig, in fact, slightly lacerating their\nfingers as it turned in resistance to all the pressure they could employ.\nSimilar results were obtained with the wire. Then Dr. Cardew walked across\nthe affected spot with the twig in his hands, but the simple apparatus remained\nquite stationary until Mr. Chesterman placed his hands on the doctor's wrists,\nwhen it began to revolve. \u2014Cheltenham Echo, December 10th, 1896.\n\f188 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nHow far the sites fixed on by the two dowsers coincided will be\nseen from Colonel Taylor's report and drawings, which I now append.\nLleUT.-COLONeL TayLor'S RePorT.\nOn December 8th, 1896, I was informed that Mr. Chesterman, of\nBath, had been engaged by the Directors of the Hatherley Laundry\nto \"douse\" for water on their property, and that he was to arrive the\nnext day. I wrote him a note and asked him to call on me when he had\nfinished, which he kindly did. On his arrival I showed him my plan\nof the laundry ground and asked him to point out where he had found\nwater. The dotted lines on the plan, Fig. 13, show the places indicated\nby him, and these agree also with the information I subsequently got\nfrom Mr. Wilkins, one of the directors, who accompanied Mr.\nChesterman during the experiment. Mr. Wilkins also told me that\nChesterman had found indications of water about the place I have\nmarked E, but as it was not a strong stream, no more was done about\n\"t\nFio. 13.\nRough plan of Hatherley Laundry, where water-finding experiments were tried,\nNovember and December, 1896.\nTompkins on November 25th traced the streams marked in continuous lines and\nrecommended Well at A, estimated at 80 ft. to yield 3,000 gals, in 24 hours, and\nalso one at B, but not so strongly.\nChesterman on December 9th traced streams marked in dotted lines and recommended\nWell at B, 108 ft., to yield 3,600 gals, in 24 hours, or Well at C, 90ft., to yield the\nsame quantity, or one at D, 85, to yield, however, less.\n\fXXXVIII.] 189\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nit. Mr. Chesterman has been for years in the Indian D.P.W., and\ntherefore quite understands a plan. No one who was at the former\nexperiment at Hathcrley was present on December 9th, and Mr.\nWilkins did not open the envelope containing the record of what Mr.\nTompkins had done till the trial was over. Mr. Chesterman was not\ntold that another man had gone over the ground, though, as he told\nme, he suspected it after he had completed his search from being asked\nwhat he would say if another finder had indicated other places.\nAll parts of the field near the laundry seem equally open to their\nchoice, but it might be said that a desire to make things pleasant for\nthe Laundry Company may have influenced each of them to locate\nwater near the engine house, well knowing that water would most\nlikely be found everywhere.1\nPrevious to Mr. Chesterman's visit Mr. Tompkins had been to my\nplace to conduct the experiments on finding coins already sent you,2\n20YDS\nFio. 14.\nRough plan of Garden behind Colonel Taylor's house.\nThe continuous line indicates the stream found by Mr. Tompkins, November 23rd ;\nthe dotted line those found by Mr. Chesterman, December 9th.\n1 Colonel Taylor sends a geological map of a section of the district, taken from\nMurchison's Geology of Cheltenham. Sand occurs in patches up to SO feet in depth,\nover the lias formation, which latter is probably some 300 or 400 feet thick at\nCheltenham ; shallow wells sunk in the sand would yield surface water, and wells\nsunk 70 to 130 feet about Cheltenham frequently yield water, which, however, is more\nor less saline. But the laundry experiment is, if anything, adverse to the dowser.\n\u2014W. F. B.\nJ These experiments will be given in a subsequent paper.\u2014W. F. B.\n\f190 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nand I had also asked Mr. Tompkins to indicate any place in my garden\nwhere underground water would be found. He traced the line\nof an underground stream and I marked it with pegs (about four\ninches long) driven in quite to their head; one spot g, Fig. 14, he\nspecially noted.\nI told Mr. Chesterman about my experiments with Mr. Tompkins\nand asked him if he would go into my garden and try to locate a\nstream found by the latter. He kindly consented. It was quite dark\nwhen we went out, but it made no difference ; in a short time he\nfound water at f, Fig. 14, and said the stream ran parallel to the road.\nHe then, passing up by the hedge, found the rod turn at the point g,\nwhen he said he was crossing a stream. I put down my hand to mark\nthe place with a peg when it came into contact with the end of the peg\nI had previously put in to mark the spot Tompkins had selected. It was\nmuch too dark for either of us to see the pegs even if we had searched\nfor them. Chesterman then walked down the centre and afterwards\nthe inner edge of the tennis ground and crossed the stream at n and i\nrespectively. The dotted line on the plan of my garden will fairly re\npresent the flow of water underground as indicated by Mr. Chesterman.\nHow far, from these experiments, it may be considered that the\nsubterranean streams influenced these two men I cannot say ; I think,\nhowever, something more than chance must have dictated their choice\nof ground.\nMr. Tompkins follows his stream when he has once struck it, the\n\" wand \" pointing the way when the stream takes a turn, and he\nestimates the distance underground of the water and the yield by the\nposition assumed by the rod and his feelings generally.\nWhen Mr. Chesterman discovers a stream he does not attempt to\nfollow it, but steps back, and then again approaching it at right angles\nmarks the spot where he first feels the indication of water. He then\ngoes some paces forward so as to cross the stream, turns round, and\nagain approaches it, marking the spot where the water is again first\nfelt. By dividing the distance between his two marks he gets a point\ndirectly over the water, and by a scale, which he has worked out from\nexperience, he judges the distance below at which the water is flowing\nby the distance between one of the points where he first feels the water\nand the point immediately over it.\nFor example, when the horizontal distance is loft. the water will\nbe 20 ft. below, and when the distance on the ground is 5 ft. 3 in. the\nstream should be 85 ft under the surface.1\n1 Colonel Taylor here gives a plan of Chester-man's method, but it is hardly\nnecessary to reproduce it, as it is purely imaginary and exactly opposite to the\nsystem described by Mr. Emerson in the American Journal of Science and followed\nby some dowsers in England. \u2014W.F.B.\n\fxxxvni.] On the So-called Divining Rod. lQ|\nEvery dowser, however, uses the method which he feels answers\nbest ; a water-finder whom I saw at work two or three years ago found\nthe distance of the water underground by raising his rod above his\nhead and then lowering it slowly till he felt \" first contact \" of\ninfluence and then he calculated by a scale he had made.\nDecember 13th, 1896. Le M. Tayloe.\nOn inquiry I learn from Colonel Taylor that the directors of the\nlaundry have not sunk a well, after all, at the place indicated by the\ndowsers, as they feared, Colonel Taylor says, \" that the water, when got,\nmight turn out to be ' Monkey Brand.' \"\nNo. 2. The Westbury-sub-Mendip Experiments.\nAmong the numerous letters and evidence of various kinds relating\nto the divining rod, which Mr. Vaughan Jenkins (to whose painstaking\nzeal this inquiry owes so much) has kindly sent me, there is a good\ndeal of correspondence relating to a dowser named Thomas Pavey, of\nCheddar. I will only refer to one case where the late Mr. Nalder, of\nWestbury-sub-Mendip, Wells, Somersetshire, employed Pavey and\nanother dowser quite independently of each other to go over his\nground at different times. I condense what Mr. Nalder says in a\ncouple of letters to Mr. V. Jenkins written so far back as October and\nNovember, 1882 :\u2014\n\"I got the two men [Mr. Nalder writes] at a month's interval\napart\u2014quite unknown to each other or of what the other had done\u2014tc\ntest my field for water, and though there was nothing to guide them, the\nrod moved within two yards of the same spot in each case ; moreover\nthey each traced the same direction as the line of the underground\nwatercourse. In other parts of the field the twig would not work (or\nonly very slightly), but it moved strongly where they asserted the\n' spring ' existed. I had a well sunk at this place and came upon a\nsplendid water supply at 39 ft. Below the surface soil we passed\nthrough a bed of gravel, 2 to 2J ft. deep, then came upon a very hard\ndry substance called by the well sinker ' wark.' The water rose in the\nwell up to within 2 ft. of the top and remains so. The well-sinker\ntold me he had sunk five wells at different places where Mr. Pavey\nfound the twig moved strongly, and in each of the cases he had\nfound abundance of water.\"\nIn a subsequent letter Mr. Nalder writes :\u2014\nWestbury-sub-Mendip, Wells, Somerset, Noeember 21st, 1882.\nI was at Cheddar this morning speaking to my butcher, Mr. John\nBranch, and he reminded me of a circumstance I had quite forgotten. It\nseems he came over to Westbury to see me shortly after Mr. Pavey had\n\f192 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nmarked out the spot for my well, and as Mr. Branch said he could \" work\nthe twig,\" he cut a forked twig from the hedge, and went to the same spot\nmarked out by Mr. Paeey, and of which there was not the least sign what\never, as I had not begun the well. So this made three persons who had\nfound the spring by the twig. Frank j Naldkr\nThere was some correspondence on this case in the London Times\nduring October, 1882. The former owner of Mr. Nalder's place pooh-\npoohed the thing and said the dowsers were only joking, to which\nMr. Nalder properly says : \" If so, it was a capital joke for me.\"\nNo. 3. The Thomastown Experiments.\nIt has been already mentioned in the Carrigoona experiments that\na friend living near \"Waterford, Mr. J. H. Jones, was an amateur\ndowser. Mr. Jones tells me that, having seen Mullins locate the site\nfor a well in his neighbourhood, which turned out remarkably\nsuccessful, he was astonished to find the rod also moved in his own\nhands and he writes to me as follows :\u2014\nMullinabro, Waterford, Noeember 29th, 1897.\nI began experimenting with the rod as a sceptic\u2014and thoroughly\nprejudiced against it, and thinking that its action in a diviner's hands was a\nmere trick or sleight of hand \u2014but I am now convinced that the thing is\ngenuine, and that the rod is moved in consequence of some action or\ninfluence produced in persons susceptible when near or over subterranean\nwator- J. H. Jones.\nIt will be remembered that Mr. Jones, in our Carrigoona experi\nments, independently pointed out the same places that Mr. Stone\nindicated as water-bearing or waterless. Mr. Jones has had\nseveral experiences of this kind, and a recent one is worth referring\nto. Water was much needed for a new convent, in Thomastown, co.\nKilkenny, and, after some unsuccessful attempts to obtain a supply\nhad been made, an English dowser was sent for ; he pointed out a\ncertain region in the convent grounds where a supply of underground\nwater existed, estimating the depth at about 80 feet ; an unlikely\nplace it seemed, as the convent field was at some altitude. Mr. Jones\nwas asked to try his hand independently, knowing nothing of the place\npointed out by the English dowser and having nothing to guide\nhim. The result was that he fixed on the same place, and I learn\nthat any possible telepathic influence was also out of the question.\nAccordingly a well six feet in diameter was sunk at the spot indicated\nas best by both dowsers. After passing through a layer of surface\nsoil and rocky d\u00e9bris, the solid rock was encountered at the depth of\n15 ft. from the surface, and (at a cost of several hundred pounds)\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 193\nthe well was sunk in a hard micaceous quartzite. The Administrator\nof the parish writes as follows to Mr. Jones :\u2014\nThomastown, Co. Kilkenny, September 21st, 1899.\nI am happy to say that we have got water on the exact spot pointed out\nby you and Mr. Wills [the English dowser]. We are now 70 ft. deep, and\nsince we reached 60 ft. water has come\u2014so far, however, in small quantities\ninsufficient for our needs ; we are therefore continuing the boring. The\nwell-sinkers declare they never encountered a harder stone. It is getting\nsoft at one side, and sand is coming up with the water, a good sign. All\nthe springs are very low now, and we expect a good increase of water during\nthe winter- John Roe, Adm.\nP.S. \u2014I should mention the water is increasing every day for the past week.\nIn reply to my inquiry the Rev. J. Roe writes :\u2014\nThomastown, co. Kilkenny, December 8th, 1899.\nIn your letter of the 9th ult., you have asked me three questions : 1st,\n\"Is water difficult to find in Thomastown, etc.?\" I may state that water\nis not very difficult to find here, but as the convent is situated in a rather\nelevated position, we anticipated considerable difficulty in finding water. The\nsite of the house is really charming, but the great drawback was water ; in\nfact, some wise heads told us we should never get it. However, we were\ndetermined to try our luck, and as the tradesmen were putting the finishing\ntouches on the building, we began sinking operations. The spot selected at\nfirst was about 12 yds. from the kitchen door. The men worked on for about\n15 ft. when we came upon the rock. We were very doubtful at first about\nour success, and having come upon rock so soon we nearly lost courage, and\ndreaded the great expense necessary even in trying to find it. I consulted\nMr. Hynes, architect, Cork, and he advised me to bring over Mr. Gataker or\nhis man. At first I laughed at the idea, and though I had heard and read a\nlittle about the divining rod, I was most sceptical as to its results. After\nsome persuasion I communicated with Mr. Gataker and he sent over his\npartner, Mr. Wills, at a cost of of \u00a310. When he arrived he looked at the\nsite already selected, and after some evolutions of his rod said he should\nabandon it, as there was only a very, very small ripple, and at great depth.\nHe then went through the whole field with his rod and marked out two or\nthree places where an abundant supply of water could be obtained, but\nselected a rather elevated spot in preference to the others. He said we\nwould most certainly get water at about 80 ft. and so many gallons per hour.\nBy a most singular coincidence Mr. Jones came on the scene accompanied\nby a mutual friend, Mr. O'Connell (engineer), Kilkenny, and this brings me\nto your second question. We invited Mr. Jones to have a try with his rod,\nand he pointed out the exact spot, and traced out the water in the same line\nas Mr. Wills had done. They were quite independent of one another, and\nMr. Jones knew nothing about the coming of the English dowser, or what he\nhad already done. Mr. Jones could not tell the depth, nor the quantity,\netc., but he was certain there was a strong current of water. I noticed in\nthe operations when they came over the places where water could be found,\nMr. Wills' rod jumped up and Mr. Jones's down. f\no\n\f194 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nThird question. We have now gone down about 76 ft. and the men have\nceased to sink any deeper, as we consider we have got a sufficient supply\nof water for the convent. To-day the pumping apparatus, etc., has arrived\nfrom some English firm, and I expect it will be in working order by the\nfirst of next month. I need not tell you how difficult it was to bore through\nthe rock and how expensive it has been upon us. The architect was anxious\nthat we should go deeper, but the men found it very difficult to carry on the\nblasting operations, because of the constant flow of water. I must ask you\nto excuse me for the long delay in writing this, but I have been very busy.\nI may add that I am uow convinced that the divining rod is no sham,\nbut genuine, and I cannot explain its influence on some susceptible people\nwhen they come over or near water. Jqw Roe, Adm\nIn a concluding letter, Father Roe, in reply to my question why he\ndid not in the first instance consult a geologist, writes as follows .\u2014\nThomastown, co. Kilkenny, December 11th, 1899.\nIt would have been wiser to have consulted a geologist before begin\nning the sinking operations, but I was obliged to act very economically.\nI did not mean by \"boring \" a small borehole, for the well is 6 ft. in\ndiameter at least from top to bottom ; I only used the word as a pumping\nphrase. I did not intend that my letters should be published, as they are\nnot very fit, but if you think they can be of any service to you in your\nvaluable researches, you have my permission to use them.\nJohn Roe, Adm.\nNo. 4. The Claverton Manor Experiments.\nIn the previous Report (p. 95) a case is quoted from the Pro\nceedings of the Bath Field Club where two dowsers independently fixed\non the same spots in an estate belonging to the Deputy-Lieutenant\nof Gloucestershire, Mr. H. D. Shrine, J.P. As one of these dowsers was\nan amateur, and an Archdeacon, the case is above all suspicion of\ncollusion, and through the kindness of Mr. Vaughan Jenkins I\nobtained the following fuller account of the experiment contained in a\nletter written to Mr. V. Jenkins by Mr. Shrine, who was an eye\nwitness. The date is somewhat remote, but the facts are not disputed.\nClaverton Manor, near Bath, December 20th, 1882.\nIn reply to your questions relating to my experience of the use of the\ndivining rod for the discovery of water, the facts are these :\u2014About twenty\nyears ago, intending to build a cottage residence on the top of Warleigh Hill,\nadjoining the hamlet of Conkwell, I employed a man named John Mullins, a\nreputed spring-finder and well-sinker living at Coleme, Wilts., to find water,\nwhich he did by means of a forked twig of hazel or thorn. He was, so far as\nI know, an entire stranger to the place, and could not have known anything\nabout the springs. I took him to the top of the wood in a flat field, the\nsubsoil of which for a great depth was known to be oolite rock. He pointed\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 195\nout by means of his forked twig where water was, in his opinion, to be found\nunder the surface, but at what depth he did not pretend to say. In every\ninstance where he said he found water, there was to my knowledge a\nspring low down in the wood in a line with the spot indicated.\nHe afterwards made some attempts to find water on the lawn in the\nfront of the house, and traced a spring upward to a spot on the grass plot in\nfront of the greenhouse where, some years before, in moving a large arbutus\ntree we had found a spring of water. To test the man's water-finding\npowers more closely, before I allowed him to sink the well, I invited my\nfriend and neighbour Mr. Earle\u2014late Rector of Monkton Farleigh, and now\nArchdeacon of Totnes, who had the gift himself, and who had found several\nwells by this process\u2014to meet Mullins in the field near Conkwell. He did\nso, and though unaware of what places Mullins had selected, they both\nagreed in a very remarkable manner in the spots where the hidden springs\nwere ; the forked twig turned with him at the same places as with Mullins.\nOn this conjunction of their discoveries I decided to sink a well, and at a\nlittle over 80 ft. deep we came to a bed of yellow clay and found water. The\nbed was, however, too thin, and the men sank the well to over 100 ft. deep,\nwhen they came to a blue marl or lias, and we have a fair supply of water\nabout 4 ft. deep.\nSince then and quite recently Mullins has found for me several springs\nin Claverton and sunk two wells, in one of which the water was found not\nmore than 6 ft. below the surface, where we had no idea there was any. In\neach instance of his finding by the twig a spring on the hill, he traced it\ndown to an existing spring unknown previously to myself. He also found\nfor us the course of several drains, the lines of which had been forgotten by\nthe workpeople, and in every case was right and saved us much trouble in\ndigging.\nIt certainly appears to me that Mullins is himself a believer in the\ndivining rod, and if it is a mere trick or deception, it is strange that he\ncould not communicate it to his own son who works with him. The twig on\nthe approach to a spring curved upwards in his hands without the least\nappearance of action on his part.\nHenry D. Shrine.\nNo. 5. The Pontyberim Experiments.\nAnother case where two dowsers, in this case both were amateurs,\nindependently fixed on the same spot is given me by Mr. J. F. Young,\nof Llanelly. A friend of Mr. Young, a contractor, was building some\ncottages at Pontyberim, a mining village noted for its anthracite coal,\neight miles from Llanelly. Wishing to select a site for a well, the\ncontractor asked Mr. Young (who is well known in the locality as an\namateur dowser) to come over and fix the best spot. Mr. Young tells\nme he had never been to the place before, and on arrival, after casting\nabout with his twig, he fixed on a certain line along which he asserted\nunderground water would be found. Having done this, he begged\nthe contractor, Mr. Williams, to try the rod himself. This he did, and\nf\nq 2\n\f196 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt\nto his surprise Mr. Williams found the rod moved vigorously, and\napparently spontaneously at the same place found by Mr. Young.\nThen Mr. Young went out of sight of Mr. Williams, and having traced\nthe course of the water-bearing fissure, as Mr. Young believed it to\nbe, he returned and asked Mr. Williams to do the same. Aware of\nthe influence of unconscious guidance by hand or look, Mr. Young\ninforms me that he took special care to avoid this, and kept out of\nsight whilst Mr. Williams tried. On subsequently comparing notes,\nthe same line was found to have been traced by both. Mr. Williams'\nsister, Mrs. Rees, to whom the cottages belong, was present, and adds\nher testimony. I have received independent reports from both Mr.\nYoung and Mr. Williams. Here is the account given by the latter ;\nafter relating what I have stated above, Mr. Williams says :\u2014\nPontyberim, October 20th, 1899.\nMr. Young then asked me to stop where I was, while he went to the side\nof the building in order to trace the course of the undergr6und water. In a\nshort time he returned and begged me to try if I could find it. I did so, and\nhad not gone far before the curious \"electrified\" sensation again returned,\nand the action of the twig could be seen moving over a certain spot, which\nproved to be the same as that located by Mr. Young.\nBut still I was in doubt as to the probability of the existence of water\nthere until a couple months after that, and in the worst of the last dry\nseason, I resolved to put it to the test, and commenced sinking a well at that\nspot. On reaching a depth of 14ft. from the surface, I had the gratification\nof striking on a strong spring of clear and beautiful water, rising since to 6ft.\nand 6ft. in the well and so it now continues, a result of much importance to\nmy sister, Mrs. Rees. JoHN WnjJamS.\nI have read the above account of the finding of the spring on my\npremises, and the account is true in every particular. Martha Rees\nNo. 6. The Mayfield Ex]ieriments.\nI am indebted to Dr. Leadam for kindly sending me the following\ndetailed account, accompanied with a map, of his experiments with\ntwo dowsers, whom he tested, independently of each other, on his\nestate in Sussex. Mayfield and Stone Mill are both on the \" Hastings\nBeds,\" a series of sands and sandstones alternating with clays ; see\nTopley's memoir on the Geology of (he Weald.\n167, Gloucester Terrace, Hyde Park, W. , Decendier 7th, 1899.\nI have a small property near Mayfield, in Sussex, a hilly district\nprincipally soft sandstone formation with hard sandstone strata, as at Tun-\nbridge Wells.\nIn 1895, as I wanted a further water supply, I sent for Mr. Gataker ;\nhe stated he had never been in the place before, and I accompanied him\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 1&7\nthroughout the experiment. As my primary object was to have an in\ncreased convenient supply for the farm buildings adjoining Stone Mill, I took\nhim over there, and he soon marked a spot, C, as promising a good supply\nat 70 ft. depth. He then indicated spots D and E, giving from 50 to 70 ft.\nas the probable depth ; a smaller but satisfactory supply at F, but, as\nhe remarked, it was altogether out of the way of the farm.\nAs I also wanted a supply for the small house at the Stock-yards, I then\ntook him round there, and he pitched upon A as a spot for a good supply at\n80 ft. I then told him that I believed there must be water somewhere near\nthe surface, as an underground dairy could not be kept satisfactorily dry, so\nhe walked round the house, and outside the garden gate, about 30 yds. from\nthe house, he marked a place, B, where he said we should find a sufficient\nsupply for that small house at 12 ft. from the surface. I may say that the\npond drawn near there is a surface pond and nearly dry in summer.\nI determined to try first at B, and set an ordinary well sinker to dig a\nwell ; exactly at 12 ft. he came upon water in a stratum of blue marl.\nI had this dug down to 20 ft., brought the pipe for a house pump into\nit, and it has been in constant use ever since, and stood steadily at about\n12 ft. from the surface during the late dry summer ; though neighbours were\nallowed to use the well, the water did not sink more than 1 or 1J ft.\nBeing well satisfied with this, I then set the same meu to dig a well\nat E, and, after digging through varying strata, the man below, whilst\ndigging in rather firm rock at 61 ft., suddenly called out to be hauled\nup as the water rushed up in volume at his feet. This flow was estimated\nat 300 gallons per hour, but there is a stratum of broken rock and rubbish\nabout 1^ ft. above, through which the water flows away ; for that reason and\nits distance from the house, and a suspicion that the broken stratum in\nsome way rendered the water unsatisfactory, I have not taken it into use,\nand my farm people have continued till now to supply themselves from the\nsmall stream shown in the map.\nHaving determined this summer that I would dig or bore somewhere\nnearer the farmhouse, I thought, before doing so, that I would have another\ndiviner over to see, as a matter of interest, to what extent his opinions\nagreed with Mr. Gataker's. You were kind enough, in answer to my\ninquiry, to recommend Mr. Stone, and he came in August. He also had\nnever been in the place before, and 1 met him on arrival and accompanied\nhim round.\nI took him first to the field near some ponds on the map ; the ponds\nwere certainly hidden by trees, and are in a dip in the ground so that Mr.\nStone could not have noticed them. He marked a spot at G, then at H,\nand traced that flow back towards G, all at about 70 ft. depth. Also at I,\nand at K, and at L, a large flow, \"bubbling up,\" as he expressed it, at about\n50 ft. depth, and flowing in both directions from there. L is about the\nhighest point in the field (A having been an ordnance survey station).\nHe then marked M exactly where Mr. Gataker had marked C four years\nbefore, and N, O and P, which he considered one stream at about 60 or\n70 ft. depth or rather less, and when I afterwards told him of Mr. Gataker's\nmarkings ho said he thought his own places better, and that they were\nbranches of the same supply. Similarly he marked Q and II, which appeared\n\f198 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nto be the stream which Gataker had marked at F on its way to the meadow\nat the bottom, and I was already aware that somewhere about there a good\nsupply was coming down to the stream and percolating into it.\nMr. Stone recommended boring at P, and I accordingly allowed him to\nsend his foreman and boring tools to do it. They went through 5 or 6 ft. of\nmould, then about 30 ft. of sand rock, unfortunately a very hard seam, then\nabout 3 ft. of blue clay. At 42 ft. 6 in. they again got into sand rock, and in\nthat at 47 ft. reached water, which rose about 6 in. up the bore hole. It\nremains at about that level and is estimated at 200 gallons per hour, but I\nhave not yet got a pump fitted. Before writing to me Mr. Stone advised\nthat the boring should be carried deeper (I think there was no justification\nFio. 15.\nA to F positions marked by Mr. Gataker.\nG to R \u201e \u201e \u201e Stone.\nWells sunk at B, E and P.\nScale\u2014About 1 in. to 850 ft., approx. fi in. to the mile.\nfor this, as I considered it simple speculation and stopped it), his view bting\nthat by going deeper we should strike a stronger spring and perhaps have\nthe water fill the bore hole to the surface. The boring showed that the\nwater-bearing rock (or sandstone) reached to 58 ft. 6 in., then blue clay to\n61 ft., rock to 65 ft., and blue clay again to 69 ft. We therefore have, in my\nopinion, run a great risk of losing the water altogether. The layer of clay\nfrom 40 ft. to 42 ft. 6 in. was peculiar, almost black, and I am sending you\nby parcel post a sample of it, and if there is any peculiarity about it, I should\nlike to know.\nI will report later to you the working of the supply when it is fixed.\nW. W, Leadam.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 199\nP.S.\u2014With two streams of water on the map you may perhaps wonder at\nthe need for boring, so I must explain that in the summer time the mill\nstream is so small that it takes three days to refill the millponds after use,\nand the water is very irony. The other stream is only just enough in\nsummer to supply my house by a hydraulic ram. It is good water, and\nappears in summer entirely supplied by percolation from the water stratum\nindicated by the diviner at P, Q and R.\nThe foregoing case is instructive, not from the coincidence of the\nspots C and M chosen by Gataker and Stone independently, a coinci\ndence that was possibly accidental, but from the illustration it affords\nof the dowser's notion of underground water. With the utmost\nassurance, wherever he goes (if his rod turns) he proceeds to trace out\nnarrow streams of water flowing underground, just as streams flow on\nthe surface. Now in the foregoing case the geology of the district is\nperfectly well known and underground streams, such as are imagined\nby the dowser, are out of the question.\nMr. Holmes makes the following remarks on the foregoing case :\u2014\nMaytield and Stone Mill are not on the same subdivision of the Hastings\nBeds, but they agree in being both on sandy, not clayey beds. Topley gives\nthe details of a quarry showing 36 ft. of stone \"at the curve of the main\nroad half a mile West of Mayfield.\" (p. 77.) He also mentions some fine\nnatural exposures of sandstone rocks (between Mayfield and Stone Mill) as\n\" continued down the valley towards Stone Mill.\" Thus the dowser there\nabouts would have not only the evidence of hard rock interbedded with clay\nor other soft stuff, deducible from the contours of the ground, but the\nactual sight of the sandstone. I note that Dr. Leadam told the dowser\nthat there must be water somewhere near the surface (par. 3), as an under\nground dairy could not be kept dry, near B, and that then the dowser\ndecided that there was water, at B, 12 ft. from the surface\u2014a very simple\ndeduction therefrom.\nGranting the dowser's honest faith in himself and his rod, it is easy to\nunderstand how he might say to himself when in a farm yard, or other\nenclosure near a house,\u2014\" That would be a convenient spot for a pump or\nwell, if there is a stream of water there.\" Any other dowser would probably\ntake the same view and hence both would try that spot in the first place and\ngive it an unconscious preference. T V H\nOther cases of two or more dowsers tried on the same ground\nindependently of each other are given both in the present Report (see,\ne.g., p. 203) ; and in the previous Report eight or nine such cases were\nreferred to and some particulars given, see Vol. XIII., pp. 32, 40,\n47, 70, 81, 89, 95, and 210. All of these were successful, but in\nmany of these cases the exact conditions of the test or of the ground\nare insufficiently described. There is, therefore, a considerable body\nof evidence of a certain value, but of what value it is hard to say,\nexisting upon this instructive point.\n\f200 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nPART V.\nExperiments in Blindfolding the Dowser.\nIn the previous Report, pages 175 and 205, I described some\nexperiments made by myself on carefully blindfolding two dowsers and\nnoting whether they were able, by the movement of the rod, to indicate\nthe same spots when blindfolded as when not blindfolded. If there be,\nas all dowsers and most of their supporters believe, a subtle influence\nexerted by underground running water upon the dowser, then blind\nfolding should make no difference. The same remark applies if the\ndowser be psychically sensitive, possessing, e.g., some kind of clair\nvoyance, \u2014provided always the dowser is at his ease, i.e., if he joins\nheartily in the experiment.\nIn all experimental work it is essential for success that the\ninstruments you employ are suitable for the purpose in view and\nalso in good order. Having selected the proper instruments, the\nmental atmosphere in physical experiments does not affect the results,\nas we are dealing with non-living matter, but the physical conditions are\nall important. In experiments with living beings, the physical surround\nings (except in so far as they produce discomfort) are unimportant, but,\nas we are now dealing with living instruments, our experiments are\nsure to fail or be inconclusive if the instrumental appliances we have to\nemploy are out of order ; and they are very apt to be deranged by a\nsudden change in the psychical conditions. Modern physical and\nchemical research has taught us the profound influence exerted by an\nimperceptible difference in the materials we are dealing with ; the\ntendency of all psychical research is to reveal that an influence quite\nas profound is exerted by an imperceptible difference in the mental\napparatus we employ. Though this may seem quite reasonable and\nobvious to most of us, it has taken physicists 200 years to learn the\nformer truth, and we should not therefore be surprised if those to\nwhom psychical research is new overlook, or even ridicule, the latter.\nIt may be remembered that some years ago Professor Ray\nLankester, F.R.S., published an account of some experiments he\nhad made in blindfolding a dowser, a lad named Rodwell, and a\ngood deal of public interest was excited by what Professor Lankester\nand many others considered to be his complete exposure of the\ntrickery of dowsers in general and of this lad in particular. Now,\nwhilst I have no wish to be an apologist for this dowser, as similar\nexperiments which I made with him (p. 205 of the last Report) were\ninconclusive, and in one instance adverse, yet it must be remembered\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 201\nthat Professor Ray Lankester, though a distinguished naturalist, is not\nan equally distinguished experimentalist. His scepticism regarding\nphenomena that do not lie within the range of his experience might\nalmost be termed ferocious, and, on the occasion referred to, it can\nhardly be said he dealt with the living instrument\u2014the dowser\u2014\nas gently as he would have dealt with his microscope. Upon this\npoint I may perhaps quote a sentence from a letter which I received\nsome time ago from Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., who is quite as keen a\ncritic as Professor Lankester, but somewhat better informed in all that\nrelates to the subject of the present research. Mr. Holmes writes :\u2014\nWith regard to the experiments of Professor Ray Lankester on the\nalleged power of Rodwell, I am very decidedly of opinion that no result\nof any value could be obtained unless the boy was quite at his ease, and that\nhe would require much more tact and geniality to put him at his ease than\na mau would. Now the impostor, or semi-impostor, shows his hand to the\ngenial man, and is rigidly on his guard in the presence of the ungenial, as\nthough \"sweetness and light\" never co-existed in the same person.\nThis is a sagacious observation, and bears out what I have already\nsaid with regard to those who are engaged in any experimental work\nconnected with our Society.\nNo. 1. Experiments by the Author.\nReturning to my own experiments, described in the previous\nReport, those narrated on p. 175 were made at Kingstown with\nMr. Stears, who readily consented to be blindfolded, but who only\napproximately fixed on the same spots when he could not see as when\nhe could see. The other experiments were made at Wimbledon (p. 205)\nwith the lad Rodwell, who strongly objected to be blindfolded, for the\nreasons there given, but who at last consented : in two experiments\nhe was completely wrong and in a third he was fairly correct. It may\nbe urged that, Rodwell being blindfolded against his will, the experi\nment was not a fair one, as he was not at his ease ; this I quite admit.\nHence I can only regret that, taken as a whole, my own experiments\nwere, as I have said, inconclusive.\nNo. 2. Mr. Pease's Experiments.\nMr. E. R. Pease made two experiments with a blindfolded\ndowser, which are described in his report on the divining rod, published\nin Vol. II. of our Proceedings, p. 85. These, like my own experiments,\nwere inconclusive, and even had the dowser been successful, the result\nwould have been of little value, as it is stated the dowser was \" led\nover the same ground \" in both cases. Unconscious muscular suggestion\nmight well have vitiated the experiment.\n\f202 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt\nNo. 3. Experiments by Lord Winchilsea and others.\nBut there is a good deal of evidence by other experimenters on\nthe blindfolding of dowsers. Eight cases in addition to my own\nexperiments were given in the previous Report. Some of these are\nwith amateur dowsers, as Mr. Golding, of Booking, Essex, p. 28 (in all\ncases pages refer to the previous Report, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.\nXIII.) ; and Colonel Aldworth, D.L., of co. Cork (p. 31), and also\na young farmer he mentions ; another case is given on p. 40. A\ncareful experiment made by Mr. J. E. Marshall, of Leeds, with the\ndowser Adams, is described on p. 48 ; an experiment with Lawrence,\non p. 70 : and with the late J. Mullins, on p. 95 ; an experiment made\nby Sir Welby Gregory, also on Mullins, on p. 97 ; and one by the late\nEarl of Winchilsea (then the Hon. Finch Hatton, M.P.) also on\nMullins (same page). Here Earl Winchilsea states :\u2014\nMullins was then blindfolded, and though led round by a different route,\nagain fixed on the same spot. At first he overran it a foot or so and then\nfelt round, as it were, and seemed to be led back into the exact centre of\ninfluence by the twig.\nThis experiment is more fully described in Proceedings S. P. R.,\nVol. II., p. 102. In this case it was the discovery of a pipe of running\nwater, but the success of the dowser may have been due to involuntary\nmuscular suggestion, as Mr. Finch Hatton states he \" led \" the dowser.\nThe same explanation may also account for the success that is asserted\nin several of the other cases mentioned in the previous Report, though\nunfortunately the particulars respecting them are too meagre to be of\nmuch value, except perhaps in the case given by Mr. Marshall.\nI will now quote some further cases of blindfolding which have\nsince reached me. The first of these is a very interesting case, and\nhere again J. Mullins is the dowser. The introductory part of this\ncase is also of interest, and might have been added to the cases given\nin Part III.\nNo. 4. Mr. Hoskyns' Experiments.\nIn the Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries for June, 1897,\nthe Editor publishes a letter from a Mr. H. W. Hoskyns, written to\nhim on January 2nd, 1889. Mr. Hoskyns, whose letter, together\nwith information he has subsequently sent me, I abridge, says :\u2014\nHaving an impure supply of water on his estate, North Perrott\nManor, Crewkeme, Somersetshire, he sent for the late John Mullins, the\nwell-known dowser, who, by means of tho rod, fixed upon the best site for\nsinking a well, estimating the water to be about 25 ft. below the surface.\nThe well was sunk, solid rock was soon encountered, and after 25 ft. below\nthe surface had been reached, and a considerable thickness of rock pierced,\nstill no water was found. Suddenly, however, when 25$ ft. had been\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Bod. 203\nreached, an inrush of water took place, so rapid that the men had to be\nhurriedly withdrawn from the well, and the water rose 23J ft., or 2 ft. from\nthe surface, and has given a constant supply ever since, even in the driest\nsummers. An old well near contained water that was so polluted that it\ncould not be used, though the well had been cleaned out severW times.\nThe spring found by Mullins has given a constant supply of pure water.\nNot far off, Mullins indicated the site of a second well, which proved\nequally successful. Mr. Hoskyns adds that one of his labourers found he\nalso had the power of using the rod, a fact corroborated by the Editor, the\nRev. C. H. Mayo, M.A., who visited the spot.1\nThere is an interesting sequel to this. In consequence of Mr. A.\nLang's notes on my previous Report, in Longman's Magazine, Mr.\nHoskyns wrote to Mr. Lang upon the subject, and the latter forwarded\nme the letter. Mr. Hoskyns writes :\u2014\nNorth Perrott Manor, Crewkerne, December, 1897.\nWith regard to the tests suggested by Professor Barrett in order to\nascertain the reality of a dowsing faculty,2 the following appears to satisfy\nNos. 1 and 2, i.e., separate examinations by different dowsers independently\nof each other, and blindfolding the dowser. Mullins having on his visit here,\nin 1888, given several (half-a-dozen or so) indications of water in the lane by\nthe two cottages, I had pegs put in on the strip of grass land opposite these\nindications, and thrust in very low, so as only just to be seen when looked\nfor, and not showing above the grass, so that the cottage children should not\npull them up or displace them. Some rather long time after, when I had\nmade up my mind to go to the further expense of making a draw-well (not\na deep one) for the cottages, having meanwhile heard that a labourer on my\nestate, one George Elson, had the dowsing power, I went with him myself,\nhad him bandaged tujhtty and deeply, well oeer the noxe, and in addition made\na steady man keep his hands over the bandago, whilst Elson walked down\nthe lane in question, holding the twig. At each halt that he made, the twig\nturning downwards for water, I looked for Mullins' peg, but the grass had\ngrown over them and they were all quite undiscernible. So I made Elson\nand his guide (for being completely blinded, he stumbled occasionally)\nscrape a mark on the road surface with their boots. When we had come to\nthe end of the lane, I returned with these men and one or two others\n1 My best thanks are due to Mr. Hoskyns for giving every facility to Mr.\nWestlake, F.G.S., who, at my request, kindly visited the spot and made a careful\ngeological examination and report on this case. Mr. Westlake reports that the old\nfoul well was probably between 20 and 30ft. deep. Mullins' well, about 18 yds. distant,\nis sunk in the Inferior Oolite, and at a depth of 25J ft. water rushed rapidly in\nthrough a joint in the rock. This well gives a splendid pure supply, even when the\nriver is nearly dry ; the water is probably dammed up by a downthrow of Fuller's-\nearth, which passes close to the farm. The second well indicated by Mullins is\n50 yards further west, is only 18 ft. deep, and does not give so continuous a supply.\nAll three wells are at nearly the same surface level.\u2014W. F. B.\n! See p. 251 of the previous Report.\n\f204 [PAHT\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\n(Elson being then unblinded) and we all made close search for the Mullins'\npegs, eeery one of which, without exception, proved to be immediately opposite\none of Elson's boot-marks on the road. This uneducated labourer could\nhave had no geological, or even rule-of-thumb, knowledge of water-bearing\nstrata, for the place was quite strange to him.\nThe only objection, so far as I can see, that can be raised to this\nextremely interesting test is that the guide, who kept his hand on\nthe bandage over the labourer's eyes, might have known where the\npegs were placed, and unconsciously tended to arrest the dowser at\nthe right spots, in fact, a case of \" muscle-reading,\" as in the so-called\nwilling-game. This is likely enough if the pegs were discernible, but\nMr. Hoskyns distinctly says they were not, and as some time had\nelapsed since Mullins visited the place, no one seems to have remem\nbered the exact spots where the pegs had been put. I have had some\ncorrespondence with Mr. Hoskyns about this interesting experiment.\nHe informs me that Elson's guide knew nothing whatever about\nMullins' pegs ; involuntary guidance is therefore excluded.\nNo 5. Mr. Westlake's Experiments.\nI asked Mr. Westlake, who was living near Crewkerne, to repeat^\nwith Mr. Hoskyns' permission, the blindfolding experiment with Elson.\nMr. Westlake reports :\u2014\nOn April 24th, 1900, I went with Mr. Hoskyns and his agent, Mr. Slade,\nto Pipplepen farm. I walked down the same lane with Elson to a little stream\nat the bottom, a distance of 1,050 ft., in the course of which his twig turned\nseven times. I then carefully blindfolded him, and on retracing our steps,\nthe twig turned ten times, five of which corresponded nearly or quite with\nhis first marks, as under :\u2014\nElson's first marks His second series when\nblindfolded.\nwhen not Difference.\nblindfolded.\n206 feet 2 inches (1) 206 feet 8 inches\n326 feet 7 inches\n+ 6 inches\n406 feet 6 inches\n(2)\n(3) 429 feet 5 inches\n564 feet 3 inches\n648 feet (5)\n(6)\n651 feet + 3 feet\n680 feet 6 inches\n762 feet\n(7) 742 feet 9 inches\n872 feet (8) 877 feet + 5 feet\n931 feet (9) 934 feet + 3 feet\n985 feet (10) 985 feet none\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 205\nElson was not held, and was only told (to prevent accidents) to keep to\nthe right or the left. The results may have been somewhat impaired, first,\nby the steward, Mr. Slade, who accompanied us, having touched Elson with\na stick (with a view to guiding him straight) at the points 1 and 5, imme\ndiately after which the twig turned ; and, second, there was more or less\nconversation, at Nos. 8, 9, and 10, Slade informing Elson that he had\npassed the cottages (a landmark between 7 and 8), that the point 8 he had\njust indicated was the well (by the roadside), and so on.\nIn view of such sources of error, I think Mr. Hoskyns' experiment much\nbetter than mine, but, as I understand that some of those who took part in\nit had seen Mullins' pegs when they were put in, one cannot feel certain\nthat the experiment was an absolutely conclusive one.\nIn the afternoon, I made a further trial with Elson in an orchard at North\nPerrott, where he had previously indicated two springs. Slade remained at\na distance. Elson having found the points, I blindfolded him and, starting\nhim from a little distance and directing him by voice, I got him to cross his\nmarks. He thereupon re-found the spots three times, his marks at one of\nthem being only a yard apart. It is possible he may have been able to\nreckon the distance ; and I noticed also towards the end of the experiment\nthat the bandage had slipped a little, and I could see the upper corner of\nhis left eye, so that he may have been guided by the trees. Thus the result\nwas probably inconclusive.\nElson's hands and arms are very muscular ; he uses stout hazel forks and\ngrips them very hard, and they turn downwards with corresponding strength,\nusually breaking, sometimes at the fork, but generally on one side ; he then\ntakes a fresh grip nearer the fork, and so on, till the stick may be used up to\nwithin an inch or so of the fork. When it turned over the stream his forearm\nmuscles were strongly contracted. He says it usually makes his left thumb\nnumb, and that he feels the effects in his biceps the day after. Mr. Slade\nsaid Elson had found water for many of the neighbours, and had never had\na failure. The farmer also told me Elson had predicted water at another\npoint half a mile to the east at 30 ft., and that it was found at 27 ft., and\nrose to within 5 or 6 ft. of the surface. \u2014E. W.\nNo. 6. Mr. Denison's Experiments.\nFor the next very interesting letter I am indebted to my\nfriend, Mr. B. St. G. Lefroy, who informed me that a Canadian\nscientific friend of his\u2014Mr. Denison, of the Toronto Meteorological\nObservatory\u2014had been making some experiments in blindfolding\nan amateur dowser. At my request Mr. Denison kindly sent the\nfollowing account :\u2014\nDenison Square, Toronto.\nWith regard to the experiments with the \"divining rod,\" I made a full\nnote of them at the time and copy the following from my note-book :\u2014June\n19th, 1898. Rode over to Mr. Harris' residence at Clarkson, 18 miles west\nof Toronto. At dinner Mr. H. told the following story. \"Last year my\nwell near the house became dry, I sent for a well-digger to increase depth.\n\f206 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nBefore doing so he asked permission to explore with a hazel wand to\nascertain if another spring would be found deeper before going to expense\nof digging. He said he had discovered a stream which would flow into the\nwell from west to east, a few feet below present level. The well was then\ndeepened, and, when down 3 ft., water did flow in from the west, so rapidly\nit was difficult to pump fast enough to enable men to lay the bricks. Ever\nsince there has been a good supply of fine water. It was at this time I found\nthe hazel wand would turn in my hands also. The stick was Y-shaped, and\nheld firmly by both hands with thumbs turned outwards.\"\nAfter dinner I got Mr. Harris to cut a forked plum stick about 20 in.\nlong\u2014he had used a hazel before and felt sure plum would not work ; how-\naver he grasped the plum switch firmly, as explained, holding it vertically\nbefore him. As he approached the well, the stick began to turn down in jerks\nuntil when over the stream to west of the well the rod turned so much that\nthe bark was twisted near his hands. Mr. Harris is a powerful man and\nendeavoured to hold the rod in its original position. I then got him to\nexplore other parts of the lawn and at 100 ft. from latter the rod again\nturned down. I then blindfolded him and allowed a sceptic in the party to\nturn him round about several times and then lead him in different directions;\nbut when he came over the first and second spots, where the rod turned\nbefore, it again twisted down. He was once more turned about and asked\nto walk as requested not in contact with any one, but the same results\noccurred. He then tried an ordinary willow, and also a lilac\ntwig, with good f] results. When a dry stick was used\nhe obtained no I I action. Finally, I bent |) a galvanised\nwire thus :\u2014 J \\^ When Mr. Harris held W this like the\ntwig, it not only moved downwards ^n^ but twisted\nround to such an extent as to form a loop thus :\u2014 ^*~ which assumed\nits natural shape as he moved away from stream.\nI also got him to follow a stream for several hundred feet. Mrs. Harris\ntried without any result, but when Mr. H. grasped her wrists as she\napproached the spring, the rod turned forcibly. One daughter, aged 15, had\nalso the power. When Mr. H. held the rod and Miss H. grasped his wrists,\nthere would be a momentary increase in the vigour of the rod twisting, and\nwhen the daughter held the rod and her father grasped her wrists, a similar\naction occurred.\nOut of the twelve persons who tried the above experiments, two had the\npower well developed, two slightly, while the remaining eight almost nil.\nWhen the weaker members used a rod over 4 ft. long, their slight muscular\naction was clearly shown by the far end of rod turning down. When\nMr. H. held the rod exactly perpendicularly, it sometimes turned inwards\nuntil it pressed heavily against his chest. At the end of the experiments\nMr. Harris' hands were considerably blistered.\nI will try to follow up these experiments. P iff T)\nIt is to be hoped that Mr. Denison will do so, as the letter shows\nhim to be a very careful observer, and I am greatly obliged to him for\nthe trouble he has taken in the matter. It will be observed that\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 207\nMr. Denison distinctly states that in his second experiment the blind\nfolded dowser was not in contact with any one, and yet was equally\nsuccessful. This is therefore an important and excellent experiment,\nand more evidence of this kind is much to be desired.\nIn these experiments with about 2 in 12 persons, or say 16 per\ncent., the divining rod \"worked,\" i.e., the forked twig suddenly revolved\nindependently of volition of the holder. I should say this is not an im\nprobable percentage, although in 1810, Professor Sementini (the Regius\nprofessor of chemistry in the University of Naples)\u2014in an essay he\npublished entitled, Pensieri e Sperimenti sulla Bacchetta Divinitoria,\nasserts that with five out of six persons on the average he found the\n\"rod\" would move, that is over 80 per cent. This large percentage\nwas doubtless due to the position of unstable equilibrium in which the\nrod was held, though it is possible this class of automatic action may\nbe more common in some countries than others. Another savant,\nAmoretti (see p. 246), who had a wide experience, states that\nhe found about 20 per cent, of those he tried were susceptible ;\nthis fairly agrees with my own estimate above. If any of my\nreaders who are interested in the subject will try, and get their\nfriends to try, the \" rod,\" or auloscope, as I have suggested it should\nbe called, and let me know with what success, I should be grateful.\nThe method of holding the rod is fully described in Appendix C to\nthe last Report.\nIt will be noticed that Mr. Denison says a dry stick would not\nwork, but any forked green twig would do and also wire. This is the\nexperience of many others who can use the rod and who usually\nattribute it to the dry stick being a non-conductor of electricity ; it is\nvery improbable that electricity has anything to do with the matter ;\nthe reason is doubtless that the green twig is more supple and elastic,\nfor whalebone is used by some dowsers in preference to a twig.\nNo. 7.\u2014Dr. ThouveneVs Experiments.\nThe next evidence is a remarkable statement made a century ago\nby a distinguished and learned French physician\u2014Dr. Thouvenel.\nThis statement refers to the young French dowser, Bleton ; the\nevidence relating to Bleton's powers as a water-finder is given in con\nsiderable detail subsequently, pp. 257 et seq. Here I need only say that\nDr. Thouvenel, having heard of Bleton's alleged powers, determined\nto test them thoroughly from a scientific standpoint. He did so,\nand published the results in a work called Me'moire physique et\nmedicinal, montrant des rapports entre les phe'nomenes de la baguette\ndivinatoire, du Magnetisme et de VElectricild. Paris, 1781. A second\nmemoir was published later, and though his theory of the divining\n\f208 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nrod was, I believe, mistaken, that does not affect the evidence I will\nnow cite. On pp. 77-80 of his first me'moire Thouvenel gives a\nsummary of the tests he made with Bleton in Lorraine. The follow\ning is a translation of the passage :\u2014\nI took the precaution to repeat several times all the experiments just\ndescribed in detail, after having carefully blindfolded Bleton ; in addition\nhis arms were sometimes fastened behind his back leaving his forearms only\njust sufficiently free to hold the baguette at the extremity of his fingers,\nsometimes even confining these in order to hinder, if possible, all mechanical\nmovement. These precautions were not taken for my own satisfaction, as I\nwas already entirely convinced.\nI conducted Bleton to places which he had never seen ; I took him\ntowards springs of which I knew, but which he could not know of, at other\ntimes over ground where neither of us knew what might be found.\nWhenever he experienced his peculiar sensations\u2014and the baguette had\nrepeatedly turned at the same spot, \u2014I then led him far away, bringing him\nback by quite different roads, still with his eyes bandaged. . . . When\nhe had followed the course of an underground spring\u2014sometimes for more\nthan a quarter of a mile, across mountains, rock, or forests, and indicated\non the way numerous sub-divisions of the same spring\u2014I made him return.\nHe then re-conducted me himself, though still blindfolded, only supported by\none arm, to the point from which we set out, without straying a single step\nfrom the line previously traced and marked by pegs, which were often hidden\nbeneath the surface. He re-found all the subterranean rivulets already\npointed out, and followed exactly the sinuosities of the underground stream.\nIt frequently happened that we came across springs whose course was\ninterrupted by walls, terraces, or wide ditches, so that in order to enable\nBleton to overcome these obstacles, I had to procure ladders, or take long\ndetours, or in some way get him conveyed across ; nevertheless, although\nblindfolded, he soon regained the course without the aid of his eyes.\nSometimes in order to try and deceive him, if his senses were concerned,\nI placed false marks as if to indicate a spring ; sometimes after he had\nfollowed a spring across several fields, I moved the pegs some feet away\nwithout his knowledge. Nevertheless, he was never led astray and always\nrectified such errors. In fine I tried all sorts of ways to deceive him, and I\ncan testify that in more thun six hundred trials, I did not succeed in doing\nso one single time.\nM. Jadelot, the Professor of Medicine in Nancy, Thouvenel states,\nwas a witness of, and co-operated in, all his experiments, which\nextended over a space of two months, and was no less struck than\nhe was with the strength and importance of the evidence obtained.\nIn addition to the foregoing we have successful blindfolding tests\nmade with Bleton by a small committee of savants quoted in No. 15 of\nPart X., p. 269. What are we to say to the above evidence? It\nis true that Dr. Thouvenel mentions that he \"led \" Bleton when bind-\nfolded, and therefore involuntary muscular suggestion may possibly\naccount for most of the success of Bleton, but the results appear too\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 209\nremarkable and too uniformly successful to be wholly explained in this\nway ; nor is it clear that Bleton was always touched by Dr. Thouvenel,\nwho, it must be remembered, was a man of scientific training and habit\nof mind. Moreover, if the blindfolded dowser succeeds, as in Nos. 4,\n5, and 6, when involuntary muscular action appears an inadequate\ncause, another explanation must be sought, and this explanation may,\nif established, be the true cause of success in some of the other cases\nwhere muscular guidance is possible.\nNo dowser of whom we have any knowledge in the present\ncentury seems to have rivalled Bleton, though it is much to be\nregretted no scientific man ever took the trouble carefully to test\nthe remarkable powers of the late Mr. W. Lawrence, of Bristol, and\nMr. J. Mullins, of Chippenham\u2014names that will be familiar to\nreaders of my previous Report. It will be noticed that Bleton, like\nStone and other dowsers, mentions the peculiar sensations he experi\nenced when over underground water ; this may be a delusion, but\nthe coincidence is remarkable, as it is wholly improbable the English\ndowser ever heard of Bleton, or had obtained the idea from him.\nAs already remarked, I do not know of any blind dowsers ; if such\nexist, it would be most interesting to ascertain what degree of success\nthey achieve. Of course, if there be any supernormal power possessed\nby a dowser, it is improbable that blindness would be prejudicial to\nits existence.\nI will here add two or three cases which, though startling at first\nsight, may be capable of explanation by muscular guidance, and there\nfore I will not weary the reader with multiplying other instances of\nthis kind that have reached me.\nNo. 8. Judge Spinks' Experiments.\nA striking case of the success of an amateur dowser when\nblindfolded is narrated by a judge in British Columbia ; this was also\ngiven in the previous Report, p. 27. His Honour Judge Spinks writes\nto Mr. P. W. H. Myers as follows :\u2014\nVernon, Okanagan, B.C., February 27Wi, 1893.\nThe rod works in my hands. I was rather sceptical, and thought that\nmy own mind might work in some unknown manner on the rod and cause it\nto turn down where I fancied there ought to be water. I was blindfolded\nand led about with the wand, for about an hour at least, until I could not\nhold the wand upright without great pain. Each time the wand dipped, a\npeg was driven into the ground to mark the spot. I was walked in all\ndirections, and passed over the same ground again and again, but in no\ninstance did the rod fail to dip when it came to a peg. I have sunk two\nwells on the credit of the wand, and in both instances have found water, in\nboth these instances contrary to the advice of the well-sinking experts. The\npower appears to increase rapidly with use. When experimenting with the\nB\n\f210 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nrod over a water hose, I had the water turned on and off several times, and\ncould distinctly feel the jar that one hears in such cases.\nWard Spinks.\nIn a subsequent letter Judge Spinks gives some additional evidence.\nA third well was sunk upon the indications afforded by the rod and\nalso proved successful ; between two of the wells the rod would not\nmove ; there the foundations of his house were subsequently dug and\nproved dry, though \"only a few feet from being immediately between\nwells 2 and 3.\" I wrote recently to Judge Spinks to inquire whether\nthe pegs were put in before he was blindfolded and if some one led him\nall the time he was unable to see. To this I received the following\nreply :\u2014\n^ ' Rossland Club, Rossland, B.C., January 12th, 1900.\nIt is some years since Mr. Streatfiold and I experimented with the\n\" wand,\" and my memory may be at fault. As well as I can remember, the\nfacts were as follows:\u2014I found several places where the \"wand\" dipped\nand marked them by driving pegs into the ground. Afterwards Mr.\nStreatfield led me blindfolded over the ground and the \"wand\" moved\nover every peg, I believe; I then led him and the \"wand\" dipped in his\nhands as it did in mine ; he was blindfolded also. We led each other by the\narm, so there ims contact. Of late years I have been travelling too much\nto make experiments, but I tried the \"wand\" last Fall, and was surpised\nto find that it did not work with me as it use to. \u00bb,- i,\u2022\n\\\\ ARD SPINKS.\nIt will thus be seen that in this case the amateur dowser was\ntouched, or led, by a friend who could see, and hence the evidential\nvalue of the case is destroyed, as unconscious muscular guidance might\naccount for the success achieved when blindfolded.\nNo. 9. Mr. Withncll's Experiments.\nThe next case relates to the blindfolding of Mr. W. Stone, evidence\nof whose success as a dowser was given in the last Report and also in\nthe preceding pages. The following Report is abridged from Morton'x\nLincolnshire Almanac for 1899 : \u2014\nSome two years ago the late Mr. J. B. Dunham, of the firm of Messrs.\nDunham and Sons, Horncastle, commissioned Mr. Stone to find a supply of\nwater at his farm, High Toynton, near Horncastle, where it was needed\nbadly. On reaching the farm Mr. J. B. Dunham declared his intention of\nputting the dowser to a severe test. With a V-shaped hazel twig cut from\na hedge close by, the diviner went over the ground in question, a field\nlocated on an incline some 200 yds. from the main road, and soon indicated\na spot where he averred a plentiful supply of pure water would be found at\na depth of about 25 ft. As he passed and repassed over this particular spot,\nthe dowsing twig, held in the manner before described, turned and bent\ncompletely over towards him. The two spectators, watching every move\nment, candidly informed the diviner that they believed the turning of the\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 211\ntwig was due to some sharp movement on the part of the holder, and Mr.\nStone readily acceded to the request that each in turn should be allowed to\nhold the mystic twig, as he himself held it, over the same place. But do as\nthey would, the twig never moved in the slightest with either. Mr. Stone\nthen suffered himself to be completely blindfolded and led away from the\nspot which he had indicated as the place where water would be found. His\ntwo guides, holding his arms (in the hands of which the twig was loosely\nheld), led him about in a circle and then in a zig-zag fashion, managing by\ndevious ways to lead him over the located spot, previously marked by a\nstake, and each time as the diviner crossed it the twig curled as before. At\nthe same time those on each side of him distinctly felt a twitching in the\ndiviner's arms, such as might be caused by an electric shock. When the\ncoverings from his eyes were removed, Mr. Stone remarked that he knew\nfrom the sensations he experienced that he had crossed the place he had\npointed out two or three times. Our previous doubts were removed ; and\nmore particularly was this the case when a short time afterwards a well was\nsunk on the site, and a most excellent spring of pure water found at a depth\nof 24 ft. In September last the writer journeyed to the same locale and\nfound that the supply of water was as good and as strong as ever, being\neven more than was required on the farm.\nHaving ascertained that the writer of the above report was a\njournalist named Mr. F. Withnell, who took an active part in the\nexperiment, I wrote to Mr. Withnell to inquire whether he had blind\nfolded Mr. Stone effectively, and received the following reply :\u2014\nNews Office, Homcastle, Lincolnshire, September loth, 1899.\nThe Divining Rod was a thing unknown to me before I came into\nLincolnshire. Therefore, as a journalist (of fifteen years' standing, and a\nmember and officer of the branch of the Institute of Journalists for ten\nyears), combined with a scepticism born of a rough life and much travel\nabroad, I determined to investigate the matter for myself. I will vouch for\nthe particulars contained in the report, and if necessary can give you the\nnames and addresses of other persons (men of standing and experience) who\nhave put Mr. Stone, in his water finding, through a similar ordeal, and\nassure me they are, as the result, fully convinced of Mr. Stone's power of\nfinding water, and even gauging the depth at which it is to be found in\napparently the driest of places.\nI blindfolded Mr. Stone personally ; closely folding a silk handkerchief\nand tying it tightly over his eyes, afterwards pulling a close texture bag,\nmade of canvas, over his head and twisting the mouth of it round his neck.\nThere was no mistake, therefore, that the blindfolding was thorough, and\nthat he was totally unable to see downwards. Mr. Stone assured me, and\nthose who were with me, that he had never before been over the ground,\nand that it was purely on account of the hazel twig turning over in his hands\nthat he was able to say that water would be found at that spot. I was\nthoroughly satisfied with the experiment and said so, and my companions\nalso expressed themselves in similar terms.\nI have been with Mr. Stone on other water-finding excursions since\nthen, and I have never known him fail in his findings or be wrong in his\nr 2\n\f212 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\ncalculations as to the depth, which he approximately estimated in each case.\nHe informs me. that he has had failures, but these are of rare occurrence\nand separated by long intervals. May I add that I have only been brought\ninto contact with Mr. Stone professionally. He resides at Old Bolingbroke,\nwhich is nine miles distant from Horncastle, where I live.\nFrep. C. Withnell.\nAs Mr. Withnell knew the spot fixed on by Mr. Stone, and it\nwas \" marked by a stake,\" it is quite possible to explain Mr. Stone's\nsuccess in this blindfolding experiment by some involuntary muscular\naction on the part of \" his two guides holding his arms ; \" albeit both\nMr. Withnell and Mr. Stone have written to me subsequently, stating\nthat no guidance was possible, as touching was excluded. This may\nhave been another trial at the same place. Here is Mr. Withnell's\nletter :\u2014\n27, Bridge Street, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, June Sth, 1900.\nAs regards my account of the blindfolding of Mr. Stone, I certainly wish\nit to be understood that Mr. Stone proceeded alone and untouched after\nbeing blindfolded when searching for water on Mr. Dunham's farm at High\nTointon ; the only place where I personally have submitted him to a test.\nAfter Mr. Stone was blindfolded, I and the late Mr. Beavis Dunham simply\nled him away from some paraphernalia that was on the ground and against\nwhich he might have stumbled, and then, releasing our hold, we allowed him\nto take whatever course he chose to take, assuring him, on his own request,\nthat we would carefully watch him and give him a warning shout if in his\nperegrinations he appeared likely to blunder against the hedge. As he\nwalked about free from obstruction, we neither touched him nor called out to\nhim. I have only this week verified this by conversation with two others who\nwere on the ground at the time, viz. : Mr. Dunham's foreman and another.\nFred. C. Withnell.\nNo. 10. Mr. Emerson's Experiments.\nSo far I have quoted the dowser's success when blindfolded, but there\nare cases of failure. I have mentioned one, when I tested Rodwell at\nWimbledon in 1890. Professor Ray Lankester's test of the same lad\nis a well-known instance of failure, and the following case of failure is\nso little known that I refer to it at some length, as it appeared in the\nleading scientific organ in America, the American Journal of Science,\nnow called Silliman's Journal, and doubtless had much influence on\nscientific opinion in America. The investigator is the Rev. Ralph\nEmerson, who five years previously had published a paper in the same\njournal on some successful experiments with the divining rod. Mr.\nEmerson's paper is so very long that I am compelled to summarise\nwhat he says with regard to the blindfolding experiment.\nIn 1821 he found at a farm in Ohio that a successful well had been sunk\nat a spot indicated by a \"diviner,\" where no sign of water previously existed.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 213\nOne of the fanner's sons, a lad of 12, discovered the rod \"worked\" in his\nhands, and it was this young lad Mr. Emerson tested. In the first instance\nthe young dowser, with his eyes open, professed to trace the course of an\nunderground vein of water, the position being marked by Mr. Emerson ;\nthe boy was then blindfolded, led a short distance away from the spot and\ntold again to trace the course of the water. He did so and the rod moving,\nhe declared he was over the spot ; this turned out to be perfectly correct.\nBut on a second and a third attempt he failed, and afterwards \"incessantly,\"\nso that, Mr. Emerson adds, \"there could be no mistake, the illusion of all\nattraction underground vanished at once. The motion of the rod remained,\nbut it must be accounted for some other way.\" Mr. Emerson then shows\nhow the motion of the rod may be caused by a very slight muscular action on\nthe part of the dowser ;\u2014this part of his paper is worth notice and is given\nsubsequently (p. 287). He explains the success of the blindfolded lad on the\nfirst occasion by his probably keeping count of the steps he took, but that\nhis incessant failures afterwards were due to his losing count, and hence Mr.\nEmerson concludes that the boy was a \" young fox \" and \" the pretensions\nof the diviner are worthless.\" 1\nA singularly illogical and unscientific conclusion, but one very\ncharacteristic of the numerous \"exposures\" with which the history\nof this subject abounds. The surprising thing is that a precisely\nopposite conclusion was not arrived at, viz., that the lad was not right\nevery time, and that Mr. Emerson did not as triumphantly assert\nthat he had conclusively established the truth of a mysterious\ninfluence exerted by the \"veins of water\" on the boy, and so \"set\nthe question for ever at rest \" on behalf of the dowser. For, on\nreading the account carefully, it seems that Mr. Emerson in every\ncase was holding the blindfolded boy : \" I took him lightly by the\nelbow \" ; \"I guided him back \" ; \"I led the lad to the next spot\nand he missed it again \" ; \"I led him to and fro, but he failed\nincessantly,\" etc. Now, if the boy had been a \"young fox,\" he might\nwith perfect ease have been right every time, simply by allowing\nhimself to be guided by the muscular indications which Mr. Emerson\nmight have given involuntarily whenever he crossed the right track,\njust as successful finds are made in the \" willing game.\" The whole\nseries of experiments made by Mr. Emerson are absolutely valueless,\nand hence his conclusion is equally so. There is, further, no evidence\nto show that this young boy was a \" dowser \" at all ; not only,\ntherefore, was the experimenter unskilled, but the instrument he\nemployed was probably defective, and a confusion of thought existed\nin the experimenter as to the object sought for (see p. 141).\nThe American Journal of Science and Artt (Silliman's), Series 1, Vol. XI.\n1826, p. 201\n\f2U Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt\nPART VI.\nDetails of a Few Further Cases of Amateuk Dowsers.\nThose who may have read the previous lleport will remember the\nnumerous cases of amateur dowsers that are there cited, particulars\nbeing given of upwards of twenty-five individuals of both sexes, and in\nall ranks of life, who had discovered by accident that the forked twig\ntwisted round in their hands, and had used its indications with some\nsuccess in the discovery of underground water. It may be of interest\nif I now give somewhat fuller details of a few of the additional cases\nof amateur dowsers that have reached me.\nNo. 1. Sir R. Harington, Bart.\nAmong notable persons who have found that they could successfully\nuse the divining rod, and who have made use of its indications with\nadvantage, may be mentioned his Honour, Sir Richard Harington,\nBart., Chairman of Quarter Sessions for Herefordshire. In the County\nCouncil Times, for July 17th, 1897, Sir R. Harington published the\nfollowing interesting letter of his experience with the rod : \u2014\nWhitbourne Court, Worcester, July IMA, 1897.\nI discovered, quite by accident, and at the age of fifty-seven, that I\npossessed this power [of using the divining rod]. I was building a new lodge\nto this place, and, desiring to find a water supply, I sent (more from curiosity\nthan from any belief in its efficacy) for the gardener of a neighbour, who\nwas said to be able to use the divining rod. He came. I watched his\nproceedings, and then requested him to allow me to try the rod myself. I\ndid so, and, to my great surprise, found that with me it assumed the vertical\nposition in the same places in which it had done so with him. He discovered\nwater, but the place which he assigned to it turning out inconvenient, I\nproceeded to investigate on my own account. I had in the meantime been\ntold the method employed to estimate the depth of the water beneath the\nsurface. I found indications of water at a depth which I estimated at about\n17 ft. to 20ft. I caused a well to be sunk, and a small supply was found at\nabout 18 ft. This, however, was at the beginning of a long drought, and\nlate in the summer the supply failed. I tried again at the same place, when\nmy rod told me there was water about 10 ft. deeper. I had the well\ndeepened, and found more, fortunately just within the 28 ft. limit, and there\nhas since (this was five years ago) been a sufficient and unfailing supply for\nthe use of the lodge.\nThe most practical use I have since turned my power to is the discovery\nof leaks in a large artificial piece of water round my house. This for some\ndistance runs parallel to tho course of a brook at a much lower level, a road\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 215\npassing along the top of the embankment, the slope of which is covered with\nwood and undergrowth. Occasionally a rat or rabbit makes a hole, which\ndraws off the water, and is difficult to find by ordinary search. I always\nfind it easily with the divining rod.\nI have never been at the trouble to ascertain how many kinds of wood\nare serviceable, but the peach and Spanish chestnut will serve with me as\nwell as hazel.\nAs may be supposed, I am not constantly searching for convenient places\nto dig wells ; but I occasionally use the rod for the purpose of showing\nfriends how it acts, and they generally try it themselves. I very rarely find\nany one who possesses the power which I do alone, but almost invariably\nwhen the person who cannot use it alone holds one end of the fork and I\nthe other, it works ; in some cases more strongly than with myself alone.\nBut I do not find that I have the power claimed by Mr. Gataker of\nestimating the volume of the water. The effect on me is the same, whether\nit is a mere trickle or a copious current.\nThat the power exists, and that it depends on some natural cause\nconnected with the physical idiosyncracy of the individual possessing it, the\noperation of which is not yet understood, I cannot, after the evidence of my\nown senses, doubt. To stigmatise the action of those who do possess it as\ncharlatanry appears to mo a specimen of that arrogant ignorance which\ndespises what it cannot understand.\nI may add that the extent of the power seems to vary in individuals.\nFor example, I cannot calculate the volume ; my original instructor could\nnot calculate either depth or volume, and, although the rod usually acts\nwhen held by another person and myself as above described, one of my\ndaughters appears to have a kind of neutralising power, and when she holds\none end of the fork and I the other, it will not act at all.\nIf the Local Government Board official, who, I understand, threatens\nMr. Gataker and his fellows with prosecutions under the Vagrant Act, will\ndo me the honour of calling here at any time when I am at home, I shall be\nhappy to try the experiment with him, and let him try for himself\u2014first,\nwhether he possesses the power alone, and, secondly, if not, whether the\nrod acts with him jointly with me. His scepticism will not affect its action.\nThe power is obviously purely physical.\nRlCHAED HARINGTON,\nChairman of Quarter Sessions for Herefordshire.\nIn reply to my inquiries Sir Richard Harington was good enough\nto write me at length confirming the facts mentioned in his published\nletter, and he also states that, on the other hand, the rod seemed to\ngive him a wrong indication on one occasion.\nIn a chalk soil in Essex two or three years ago it indicated water on a\nfriend's property near the surface. My friend dug down to the depth\nguessed, but found none, and I dissuaded them from incurring further\nexpenses, lest I should be mistaken.\nThe principal practical use to which I have put the power is to fix\nthe locality of leaks in the bank of an artificial piece of water, and in\n\f216 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\ndetermining the course of underground drains and leaks therefrom. For\nthese purposes I have found the power practically useful.\nSir Richard Harington in reply to my question as to whether he\ncould give me any further particulars of the use of his power, or the\ndates, etc., at which he found the leaks in the bank, writes as follows ;\nafter giving some details which are contained in his published letter,\nhe adds :\u2014\nWhitbourne Court, Worcester, October 29th, 1899.\nIt has occasionally happened that leakage into the brook has taken place\nthrough rat holes and the like, the locality of which my servants have been\nunable to discover. When this has been the case, I have used the divining\nrod, which has always told me correctly where the leak was. I cannot give\ndates, but the event has occurred on two or three occasions during the last\nten years.\nThe piece of water in question is supplied at one end from the above-\nmentioned brook by means of a culvert of some length .\nIt appearing that there was waste of water in this culvert, I tried the\ndivining rod, walking parallel to it. It told me, as the fact turned out to\nbe, that the leaks were numerous, so many, indeed, that it was useless to\nrepair the culvert, inside which I had to lay glazed pipes. This took place\nin the year 1898. Richard Harington, Bart.\nThe use of the \" rod \" to find a hidden leak in a culvert or reservoir\nhas been successfully tried by others ; see, e.g., p. 41 of my previous\nReport, where the amateur dowsers, Messrs. Young and Robertson, inde\npendently fixed on the same spot. Mr. Westlake, F.G.S., has recently\ninformed me of another case, where the dowser, R. Pavey, of Cheddar,\ndid the same thing at the moat round the Bishop's Palace at Wells.\nAn engineer was first employed, and had spent \u00a320 in trying to find\nthe leak, but failed. Pavey, though a stranger, found the leak at once,\nand it was then stopped at a cost of a few shillings. Mr. Westlake\nvisited the place and ascertained the facts ; he states the engineer was\nmuch impressed by Pavey's success, as he, after careful and costly\nexamination of the place, had failed. Experiments of this kind are\nworth careful repetition under strict scientific supervision.\nNo. 2. Mr. E. Hippisley.\nOne of the most successful amateur dowsers of whom I have\nheard was the late Mr. Edwin Hippisley, a leading man in Wells,\nSomerset. Mr. Hippisley was a member of the Institute of Surveyors,\nand his firm, Hippisley and Sons, are the principal surveyors and\nland agents in Wells. At a meeting of the Wells Archteological\nSociety, held at the Bishop's Palace, in Wells, in April, 1892, Mr.\nHippisley read a paper on his experiences with the dowsing rod. A\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Bod. 217\nverbatim report of that paper appeared in the Wells Journal for\nApril 21st, 1892, together with an interesting discussion that followed,\nin which the Bishop of Wells, who was in the chair, the Dean, and\nothers took part. Mr. Hippisley's paper is too long to quote, but the\nfollowing are some abridged extracts from it. Though his theory (a\ncommon one) is improbable, his facts are of considerable interest.\nIn using the rod I always find the point turn upwards to a nearly vertical\nposition when approaching an underground spring, and it reverses its action\nafter the spring is passed over : upon turning round and walking over the\nsame spot the same thing occurs. The only theory I can form is that those\npersons who have the \"gift,\" as it is called, are more susceptible to electrical\naction, water being a good conductor of electricity, and that the rod is\nmoved owing to some sensation in, or electric influence on, the body of the\noperator.\nMr. Hippisley then proceeds to give details of numerous instances\nof his discovery of underground water by means of the rod, which\nproved of great practical value.\nFor instance, at the Lodge to the Cemetery at Portway, at the\nSanatorium near Axbridge, at cottages near East Horrington, at\nBurcot, at Wookey Hole, and at two or three other estates in\nSomerset. At Cotford Farm, near Taunton, a well was being sunk\nfor the Western Somerset Asylum, and after 50 ft. had been sunk,\nMr. Hippisley, by means of the rod, directed the men to drive a\nheading west of the well, when a largely increased supply of water\nwas obtained. Another and remarkable case at Lytes Cary I have\nalready given on a previous page (see p. 174.)\nNo. 3. Mr. J. If. Jones.\nThe next case is that of a country gentleman to whom I have\nalready referred, and who is well-known to me, Mr. J. H. Jones, of\nMullinabro, near Waterford. In answer to my request for a brief\naccount of his experience, Mr. Jones writes as follows : \u2014\nWaterford, January 3rd, 1900.\nSome few years ago, a friend and neighbour of mine, after trying in vain\nto obtain an unpolluted water supply for his house, decided on enlisting the\nservices of Mr. Mullins, the dowser. I was asked to witness the experiments\nand was glad to do so.\nMr. Mullinn, on his arrival in Waterford, per steamer, drove rapidly to\nhis client's house and in a few minutes indicated an underground water\nsupply near the house quite unconnected, as he alleged, with the flow to a\npolluted pump-well in the stable yard ; he pointed out a favourable spot for\nsinking, where subsequently a splendid supply of pure water was found at\nabout 30 ft. deep. On the evening of Mullins's visit, I, for curiosity, cut a\nforked rod similar to the one he used, and experimenting in a field at home,\n\f218 Professor W. F. Barrett. [PART\nfound, to my surprise, that at one place the rod turned vigorously in my-\nhands. Walking onwards in a zig-zag direction (similar to the way Mr.\nMullins proceeded in tracing an underground flow of water), I traced the line\nof flow detected by me until I found its outcrop in a never-failing spring at\nsome distance from the place where I first found the rod to turn. The\ndirection of the flow to this spring greatly surprised me, for I had hitherto\nimagined that the spring was fed from a lake, the water from which, at about\nhalf-a-mile from the spring, disappeared under the face of a limestone cliff,\nemerging in a short distance. Here, I imagine, there could be no \"sub\nconscious \" influence derived from my knowledge that a spring existed some\ndistance from where I first felt the influence of the rod, inasmuch as the line\nof flow traced out by me by its moans was in a direction nearly at right\nangles to my preconceived notion of the direction of the supposed feeder of\nthe spring.\nThe ensuing evening I tested myself where Mr. Mullins had found the\nline of flow for my friend, and I found I could trace it exactly as he had\ndone. Here it might be said I was unconsciously influenced by Mr.\nMullins's action, but, as I traced the flow for some fields beyond where he\nstopped and where neither of us had any idea the line ran, the theory of\nthe influence of his findings on me seems to break down.\nThe above experiments converted me (in spite of my determination at\nfirst to doubt the buna fides of the dowser's indications) from being a\nprejudiced sceptic to being a confirmed believer in the genuineness of the\ndowser's claims to point out underground flows of water.\nWhat is the mystic influence emanating from water, and why it should\nproduce the effect I have described is a problem for scientists to solve.\nIt is marvellous to find a flow of water, as I have proved, exercising a\nstrong influence through 70 to 80 ft. of a dense quartzite rock.\nThe influence is in my case independent of contact with the ground. It\neffects me though insulated by standing upon a support resting on glass. I\ncan feel the influence of underground water in a house as readily in the\ntopmost storey as on the ground floor. I can also feel it\u2014 apparently as\nstrongly as when standing on the ground,\u2014when I am riding, driving, or\ntravelling by rail, and this not over predetermined places, but over untried\nground.\nMr. Jones then goes on to describe how he endeavoured to verify\nthe accuracy of the indications given by the rod by going over ground\nthat had been previously traversed by other dowsers before he was\nacquainted with the places they had fixed upon as water bearing ; the\nresult, he says, convinced him that some peculiar effect was produced\nupon hitn by underground water, an effect that caused a certain\nspasmodic muscular contraction in his arms and hands, thus producing\nan involuntary movement of the rod. Mr. Jones states that on\napproaching the spring, the point of the rod begins to creep upward\nand is more or less violently jerked into a vertical position when\ndirectly over the water ; the rod he recognises as merely an index of\nsome peculiar impression produced upon himself.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 219\nNo. 4. Mr. J. D. Enys, F.G.S.\nIn the preceding Report (Vol. XIII., p. 7) it was mentioned\nthat the President of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, Mr.\nJ. D. Enys, F.G.S., was an amateur dowser. In a recent letter to me\nMr. Enys says :\u2014\nEnys, Penryn, Cornwall, May fith, 1900.\nIn answer to your questions I may say (1) that only a slight feeling is\nproduced in me when the rod commences to move over underground water,\nbut a distinct feeling of relief when I let it go. (2) In a place I indicated\n(which place was also chosen by the dowser who showed me how to use the\nrod) an abundant supply of water was reached at 96 ft., which has stood the\ntest of the late dry season.\nThe clerk of my Parish Council here (St. Gluvias), Mr. .). Lowry, tried\nthe rod, at my request, over a place where I knew a spring existed ; suddenly\nI heard him cry out, with genuine surprise, \" It is alive, sir ; it is alive.\"\nThis exactly describes the sensation when the rod moves. I am unable, how\never, to form any opinion of scientific value on the action of the rod.\nJohn D. Enys.\nThe interest of this letter is in the fact that not only is Mr. Enys\na gentleman of high standing in his county, but he is also an able\ngeologist. I asked Mr. Enys if he would try some blindfolding\nexperiments, with precautions to avoid unconscious muscular guidance\nand other possible sources of error, but he has not as yet had time to\ndo so. I hope he will pursue the subject.\nNo. 5. Mr. J. F. Young.\nIn the previous Report, I referred on page 40, to two amateur\ndowsers, Mr. J. F. Young and Mr. Robertson, of Llanelly, S. Wales,\nwho have written a little book on the divining rod. Mr. Young has\nhad an extensive correspondence with me, and has also in person\nrelated to me the numerous experiments he has made with the rod in\nthe attempt to arrive at some solution of its perplexing movements.\nI have been much struck with Mr. Young's enthusiasm, intelligence and\nscientific spirit, and it may be interesting to put on record the follow\ning account which Mr. Young has sent me of his own experience.\nThe account is of greater interest from the fact that Mr. Young\nwas unaware, until he subsequently read my previous Report, that\nthe divining rod, like planchette, was an autoscope, and therefore its\nmovements were profoundly influenced by any predetermined idea or\nsuggestion. Mr. Young's experience is very similar to that of some\nearly writers on the rod, such as Zeid'er, who in his Panlomysterium\ngives an account of the manifold objects which excite the motion of\n\f220 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nthe rod, and hence suggested the title of his book.1 Mr. Young writes\nto me as follows :\u2014\nLlanelly, South Wales, July 3rd, 1897.\nI will, with your permission, place before you some of my personal\nexperiences with the \"rod,\" trusting you will understand I am only a\nstruggling tradesman, with but little learning and very little spare time, but\nwith an earnest desire to search for the truth, and with that object I have\nbeen for years an ardent reader of mental physiology, and psychological\nbooks of all kinds.\nI soon became convinced that the movement of the rod was due to an\ninvoluntary action on the part of the \"diviner.\" To prove this I have\nwatched carefully my own hands (and others') and in every case when the\nsubject sought for has been found, 1 observe a difference in the relation of\none hand to the other ; there is in my own case a slight advance of the right\nhand. In other cases with larger rods, I note the arms at the elbows, which\nare usually fixed to the side, give greater indications of a closer grip, and the\nhands are clenched together ; others watching have confirmed my views.\nWhat causes this involunary movement of the muscles I cannot say, but\nI will give a series of cases where it is produced and where I have used the\nrod successfully.\nWater-finding was the first which engaged my attention ; finding the rod\nturn in my hand, I tried every available means of proving the reality of a\nwater-finding faculty. At last I was convinced of its truth and its useful\nness to mankind. Electricity is generally put forward to explain mysteries\nwe know nothing of, and I fell into this same trap. I set to work, and made\nmany electrical appliances (which gave me great pleasure, as it revealed what\nI previously knew but little of) to tost the matter, both in relation to the\nsoil, the atmosphere and my own personality, and at one time I thought I\nhad it within my grasp, but alas, with more knowledge, events transpired\nwhich toppled my electrical theory over. I left electricity for the study of\n\"Odic Force,\" Animal Magnetism, Telepathy, Clairvoyance, Automatism,\netc., and latterly the Spiritualist hypothesis, including in its wide range our\n\" subliminal consciousness,\" and I look upon this last as one that meets the\nquestions at all, or nearly all points ; and here I may add in opposition to\nsome arguments which have been put forth by some, it seems to me, taken\non the lines of this latter theory, it becomes a proper subject for investiga\ntion by the S.P.R., as it is a question of the; study of human personality\nand not of the rod.\nI take it that the different sensations and experiences of different water-\nfinders is a matter of idiosyncrasy, as in my own person these vary according\nto conditions, from a strong convulsive feeling at one time, another a state\nof ecstasy, at another a peculiar, unpleasant feeling at the pit of stomach,\nand latterly a quick shock, darting, as it were, through the nervous system\n1 I have added this quaint book of Zeidler's to our S.P.R. Library. Its title is\nPantonuisterium oder das Neue vom Jnhrc in der Wilndschelrutht, etc., Magdeburg.\n1700. It has eleven plates and thirty-one figures of different kinds of \" divining rods,'\nmade of every kind of forked article, such as tongs, snuffers, etc Later on, I will\nmake further reference to this lxxik, an excellent abstract of which has been made\nfor me by Miss Stokes.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 221\nat the moment of the perception. This sensation belongs especially to\nClass G of experiments (see below).\nIn a number of the experiments the rod seems indispensable, but even\nthen merely as an indicator, its motion being a notification to my brain that\nthe influence has taken place, which otherwise would not have reached my\nconsciousness, and for these especially delicate tests I use the form of\ninstrument enclosed. It is a small aluminium fork, light and delicate to the\ntouch, and, being nearly void of elasticity, no tension can be put on. The\ninstrument I hold lightly between finger and thumb of each hand, and when\nit acts, it either slowly creeps up or suddenly twists at the moment of the\nimpression.\nThe experiments for convenience of reference I will classify, commencing\nwith Class A, which includes all experiments with water, the feet in every\ncase coming directly or indirectly in contact with the soil, the latter through\nthe medium of a horse, or some form of conveyance, or anything that\ntouches terra firma. The so-called insulation by bottles and other non\nconductors, or even rubber boots, may be traced in their several effects to\nimagination on the part of the water- finder.\nI have made some very critical tests in this direction, and have found all\nso-called insulation a failure.\nI may here remark that in all investigation in this matter (with a good\nsensitiee) that suggestion, thought or spoken, of the agent plays a very\nimportant part.\nClass B includes the finding of metals of all kinds, either hidden, buried,\nor lying on the surface. A coin or two may be (by another person) hidden\nwith some opaque covering. The hands of the sensitive, with or without the\nrod, being merely passed above the table, its whereabouts is at once localised\nand the finger goes down straight upon the coin. Telepathy cannot explain\nthis, as it can be so arranged that no one can know where the coins lie.\nWith the case of coins I must not omit to include the singular fact that\nwhere metal has lain, it leaves an influence for many hours, which can in the\nearly hours be detected as well as the coin. Or, on a country road, say, but\nseldom used, I can locate the track of the wheel and the spots where the\nhorse has trod. A wonderful variety of experiments can be made under this\ngroup.\nClass C. \u2014The finding of heat rnys that have fallen on earth, stone, wood,\netc. : of a shadow7 or line of light, etc.\nClass l). \u2014The localising of a given spot, say a square inch, on which\nsound has been projected closely ; this vibration soon passes away, and cannot\nbe done unless tried at once.\nClass K.\u2014Currents of electricity in a wire ; but this is difficult to prove,\nas the influence might be due to the metal and not electricity, as in the case\nof water flowing through metal pipes.\nClass F. \u2014The finding of a locality where friction has been made, say\nrubbing a floor, carpet, etc., if dry. On a dry walk it is successful ; on a\nwet one, not so.\nClass G. \u2014 Under this heading the experiments are so numerous that my\nnaming two or three will give you an idea how easy it would be to extend\n\f222 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nthem ; the phenomena taking place here are really the same that underlie\nthe whole of the phenomena connected with the divining rod faculty.\nMrs. Young (my wife) whom I shall hereafter call the agent, and myself\nthe subject.\nExpt. 1. \u2014Picture to yourself Mrs. Y. sitting at one end of a room; a\ncertain line is indicated on which I shall walk down the room from her and\nwith my back toward her ; she has a watch before her, and at a given moment,\nonly known to herself, wills me to stop ; that moment the rod moves and I\nstop. Sometimes when in good form I can do so minus the rod.\nExpt. 2 \u2014Mrs. Y. in same position fixes mentally, unknown to me (my\nback always toward her) on a sprig, flower or pattern on the carpet iu a\ngiven line. I start on the quest ; as soon as my foot \"touches the spot,\" the\nrod moees.\nExpt. 3.\u2014I now walk along near the wall. Mrs. Y. has fixed on a spray,\nflower, picture, bracket, vase or some such small object, say the height of\nmy shoulder or head. As soon as I get opposite the signal comes. Many of\nthese are conducted by the agent in one room and the subject in another.\nYou will observe here also there cannot be any bodily contact.\nExpt. 4. \u2014Cut, say, a dozen pieces of paper all alike, an inch square,\nmark one only, as you like, say pencil initials or a number. After stirring\nand mixing up, place all on floor in different parts, not knowing the nmrked\nono. The subject walks about, and ultimately finds the marked paper. In\nthis way you cut out thought reading or telepathy.\nExpt. 5. \u2014A hair from head or beard is placed on the floor, the subject,\nof course, being absent. The agent leaves the room, accompanied with a\nstranger (who is not in the secret) to see fair play ; or the subject may be\nblindfolded or walks backward. As soon as he reaches the spot his rod\nmoves. I won't trouble you with more, as you can picture to your mind's\neye scores of similar experiments, those above narrated, with others quite\nits extraordinary, all indicating an intelligence\u2014call it what you will\u2014not\nunder our control. It is almost needless to add that times occur with me\nand also with the agent when this cannot be done, and there are times when\nthe power, whatever it may be, appears to be overflowing. It is, however,\nexhausting, and, after half-a-dozen experiments, a rest is required. I will\ndo my best to carry out any other experiments you may suggest, and hope\nwhat I have recorded may be of some use.\nThe foregoing experiments must simply be taken for what they\nare worth ; they are not quoted as of evidential value, for we do not\nknow, e.g., how far any involuntary and unintentional signs from the\n\" agent \" may have reached the \" subject\" of these experiments. The\ndetection of points de repere by hypnotised subjects, usually attributed\nto hyperesthesia, resembles Mr. Young's detection of the track of a\nhorse, etc., by the use of rod, and I am inclined to think the explana\ntion in both cases is similar.

It further shows how absurd is the dowser's notion that\nunderground water must be indicated when the forked twig twists\nround in his hands.\nNo. 6. Mr. R. G. D. Tosswill.\nThrough watching Mr. Young's use of the forked twig in Devon\nshire, a gentleman at Budleigh Salterton, Mr. Tosswill, found the twig\nalso moved when he held it. He soon became an enthusiastic amateur\ndowser, and sent me the following account of his experience after\nreading my previous Report :\u2014\nBudleigh Salterton, Devon, October 13th, 1897.\nThe first time that 1 saw the \" hazel rod \" used in seeking for water was\non August 11th, 1897.\nMy friend who used it was searching for the spot underneath which a\nsmall stream of water was flowing through the adit of an old disused copper\nmine. He asked me to walk alongside him and closely observe the move\nments of the rod as he passed over the water. I did so, and soon observed\nthe top of the rod quiver, and then move slowly forward and outwards away\nfrom his bodj', until the point of the rod pointed downwards to the ground\nat his feet.\nHe then asked me to try it, and walk over the same course that he had\ntaken, holding the rod in precisely the same manner. I did so, holding the\nrod perpendicularly, with the end of either branch laid on the palm of\neach hand, with Angel's and thumbs tightly closed, and back of the hands\ndownwards.\nOn advancing, I fully expected to find that if the rod moved at all in my\nhands, it would do so in precisely the same manner as it did with my friend.\nTo my astonishment, however, I found that on coming to the same spot, the\nrod quivered slightly, and then moved towards my own body, imoards, and\nthen downwards, pointing to the ground. This was exactly in the opposite\ndirection to which it had previously moved when in my friend's hands.\nSince then I have used the hazel rod or some other \" autoscope \" nearly\nevery day in seeking and tracing underground springs, water pipes, drains,\nhidden coins, etc. Hazel, willow, beech, thorn, elm and honeysuckle twigs,\nas also copper and other wire rods or forks that I have used, holding them\nperpendicularly either in the closed hands or between the thumbs and\nforefingers, move always in the same direction, i.e., inwards and towards\nmy body, and then downwards pointing to the ground.\nRobert G. D. Tosswill.\nNo. 7. Mr. G. II. Ward-Humphreys.\nIn the Cheltenham Examiner for March 24th, lt97, Mr. G. H.\nWard- Humphreys gives a lengthy report of his first experience with\nthe divining rod, which affords a good illustration of the genesis of\nan amateur dowser and the amazement\u2014shared by educated as well\nas illiterate persons\u2014 excited by the apparently automatic motion of\nthe twig.\n\f224 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nThe night before, Mr. Gataker had expressed the belief that I was likely\nto possess the power of \" divination \" ; and he was now very anxious for me to\ntry my luck at once. He cut several twigs and armed me with one, and\nthen, taking me down to the side of the lake where water already found\nwas pouring in, he suggested I should walk across the covered-in stream.\nThis I did three or four times in succession, holding the twig, but I was\nconscious of nothing, nor did I see any movement of the twig. He then,\nhowever, laid his hands upon the back of mine, and he walking backwards\nin front of me, we together crossed over the flowing water. Immediately\nthe V-shaped twig turned completely round in my grip. Perhaps it is\nunnecessary to say anything about the astonishment with which I regarded\nthis extraordinary movement of the inanimate twig. But what happened\nafterwards was even more remarkable : for, on going round to unbroken\nground upon the other side of the lake, at one spot I felt the twig, which\n1 was carrying with its point downward, so turn in my hand that the point\nwas raised through an angle of 90deg. Inquiries elicited the fact that this\nspot was exactly over a stream which had been found twelve months ago.\nBut even now I was not convinced : though I could not believe that the\nothers were deceiving me, I thought it possible that I might be deceiving\nmyself. So I suggested that I might be blindfolded, led some distance from\nthe spot where I was then standing, and then should be guided in such a\ndirection that I must cross the line of the same stream. This was done,\nand I started my walk at a distance which I afterwards found to be about\n60 yds. away. Walking then in the direction I have indicated, I suddenly\nbecame aware that the twig was commencing to move. This tendency became\nstronger at every step. I cast to the right and to the left, and finally guided\nby the stronger movements of the twig, walked some 15 yds. to the left of\nmy original path and then stopped, the twig having now moved through an\nangle of 180 deg. My companions, who had hitherto been silent, were greatly\namused at the sceptic [the writer]\u2014who found, when able to see, that he had\nstopped about 3 ft. away from a peg which had been put in to mark the site\nof one of Mr. Gataker's springs ! After this, scepticism vanished.\nIt will be observed that Mr. Ward-Humphreys states that when\nblindfolded he was \"led,\" so that the explanation of his success in that\ncase may be due to the involuntary guidance exercised by those who\nwere touching him.\nNo. 8. Mr. G. F. Attree.\nIn the Estates Gazette for February 3rd, 1 900, Mr. G. F. Attree, an\nauctioneer and estate agent of Brighton, gives a lengthy account of nis\nexperiences as an amateur dowser. He points out how prejudiced he\nwas against the whole subject until, after watching a dowser at work,\nhe discovered to his surprise that the twig moved in his own hands,\ntwisting round whenever he came to the places marked by the dowser.\nHe goes on to say :\u2014\nThe operator holds the two ends of the twig so that the point of the V\nis at a right angle with his body and the thumb of each hand is in contact\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 225\nwith one end of the twig. In this position he walks over the land where he\nwishes to ascertain what springs exist. On coming over running water (no\nmatter how deep it may be from the surface) the operator feels a tingling\nsensation in his hands and arms, and the twig immediately twists over until\nits point has completed more than half a circle.\nDuring the year 1898 I spent much of my little spare time with the twig,\nfrequently testing springs which I could prove through existing wells, and by\nthis means, and by measuring the width of the influence on the surface of\nthe ground, became able to gauge accurately the depth and strength of a\nnumber of springs. ... I cannot say why so few persons possess the\npower, nor what the current is that passes from running water through the\nbody of the operator, causing the twig to twist. All I have been able to\nascertain is, that it is not an ordinary electrical current, for insulation by\nglass or indiarubber, which will stop the one, has no effect upon that which\nis brought into force in water-finding.\nMr. Attree is an enthusiastic believer in the \" rod,\" and objects to\nthe term \" divining-rod \" and \" water-diviner,\" as he affirms there is no\nguessing or divining or pretending practised by an honest water-\nfinder, the motion of the rod being due to some cause beyond the\ncontrol of the operator : he states that he has successfully made use of\nthe indications of the rod in finding \" springs \" for the benefit of his\nfriends and neighbours. Several of these instances are given by Mr.\nAttree, and I have recently received some interesting additional\nevidence of Mr. Attree's faculty as an amateur dowser.\nThe interest of this case is the additional illustration it affords (1)\nof the involuntary muscular action that causes the motion of the\ntwig ; (2) of the accompanying peculiar sensation affirmed by so many\ndowsers; (3) of insulation not affecting the motion; (4) of the im\nplicit belief of the operator that whenever the rod twists the presence\nof underground water must be indicated ; and (5) of the readiness with\nwhich incredulity becomes credulity when something (such as the\ntwisting of the rod) happens contrary to the sceptic's expectation ;\nthe dowser's erroneous views about \"springs\" and \" head of the\nspring \" being forthwith accepted without examination.\n\f226 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nPART VII.\nMiscellaneous Cases.\nI will here add a few stray cases that do not come under the\nprevious classification. The following was kindly sent me by the\nRight Hon. Sir Edward Fry, D.C.L., F.R.S, etc. To those who\nimagine that dowsers are only employed by the credulous and\nignorant, this testimony, from one of the highest judicial authorities\nin our country, who is also a man of science, is a sufficient reply.\nFailand House, Bristol, October 13th, 1898.\nI have sunk in four places for water near here. The first time was some\ntwenty-five years ago at Failand House Farm. There I was guided by Mr.\nLawrence, a well-known dowser, who lived somewhere in Gloucestershire.\nI sank for water and got some, but subsequently, under Mr. Merry-\nweather's advice,1 I deepened the well, and have now a very good supply,\nwhich has shown no signs of failure even during the prolonged drought of\nthis year.\nI sank a well about 20 ft. in Faulkner's garden\u2014on my own selection\nof the spot\u2014got no water, and gave up the pursuit.\nAbout six years ago I sank a well near this house, and got %vater at, I\nthink, 36 ft. This now supplies this house and the garden, stables, etc., etc.\nThe site was chosen by a dowser, who came over with my architect, Mr. Price,\nof Weston-super-Mare.\nI was not here either when Lawrence dowsed for the farm well, or Mr.\nPrice's friend for the well near this house, and know nothing in particular\nabout their proceedings.\nI consulted Mr. Merryweather same years ago about sinking a well near\nthis house, and he dowsed and thought he could find a line of water, but I\ndid not act on that suggestion.\nLast year, wanting to get a water supply for a farm (Lower Failand\nFarm\u2014Parson's) I again consulted Mr. Merryweather. He came with his\ntwo sons, to one of whom he attributes the power of dowsing, and 1 went over\nthe ground with theni, and he ultimately advised me to drive a tunnel into\nthe hill. He did this work for me, and found water, though it has failed\nduring the long drought. I am not sure whether there is not a leak in the\ntunnel.\nThere is no doubt a good deal of water in the hill on which all the land\nin question lies, but how far it is to be found everywhere I cannot say.\nI rather incline to the belief that the old red sandstone, which is the rock,\nis traversed by faults or lines of weakness, and that down these the\nwater passes.\n1 Mr. Merryweather is another dowser. See previous Report, p. 72. He died\nrecently.\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 227\nIn the search for water of last year Mr. Merryweather certainly did not\nrely on the watch spring alone.1 He considered also indications of\nwater on the surface (from the character of the herbage) and the presence of\nsmall springs or droppings of water in the rocky sides of the lane, from\nwhich we drove the tunnel. He has been a well-sinker for years before he\ntook to dowsing, and would, I am sure, scout the notion that he should\nneglect other indications of water. I may add that I have known him for\nmany years\u2014that I have employed him not only as before mentioned, but\non other matters relating to drains, etc., and that 1 believe him to be a\nthoroughly honest man. Edwaxd Fry\nThe fact mentioned by Sir Edward Fry that Merryweather is in\npart intentionally guided by surface indications is very interesting.\nThis, however, is not usually the case with other dowsers, so far as I\nknow. The value of surface indications is referred to more fully in\nanother part of this paper. Sir Edward Fry also sends me the follow\ning extract from a volume called Memorials : Part II, Personal and\nPolitical, by the Earl of Selborne, Vol. II., p. 384-5.\nIn a letter to his daughter, the Countess of Waldegrave, under date\nSeptember 25th, 1893, Lord Selborne writes, after referring to the effects\nof the drought :\u2014\"Willie\" (i.e., the present Earl of Selborne) \"brought\na water-finder from Wiltshire to see if he could find near the reservoir any\nunderground water which could be used for increasing the supply there,\nand he did find it as he said, but till this is verified by sinking to the neces\nsary depth I shall suspend my belief, though the same man has been\nsuccessful in finding it at Hatfield and for Lord Jersey.\" To this a note is\nadded, \" The divining rod proved successful.\"\nThere are, I believe, no professional dowsers in Ireland, though\nEnglish dowsers are in considerable request in certain parts of the\ncountry, and there are a few amateur dowsers.

Tyrone, has lately\nreached me through a friend : \u2014\nMullantean, Stewartstown, October 17th, 1899.\nThe water-finder, William M'Crea, who lives near Stewartstown, was\nhere to-day, and found two springs for us. It is really wonderful the way\nthe rod turns in his hands ; it broke nearly in two, though it was a strong\npiece of ash. He says he sleeps badly the night after he does much of it,\nand at the time it feels as if the sinews of his arms were being torn out.\nHe first tried the rod about twenty years ago, when an uncle of -his came\nfrom America, who had made a good deal of money there by finding springs,\nso he tried if he had the power, and found he had. He can tell how far the\nspring is down by counting the feet from where the rod begins to tremble\n1 Mr. Merryweather, like the late Mr. Lawrence, always preferred to use a long\npiece of flexible steel rather than a forked twig as an indicator, or \"autoscope.\"\u2014\nW.

[part\nuntil it turns over, \u2014double that distance is generally right, but he won't\nengage that, though he says in most of the wells sunk he has been right to\na foot or two. He has found a fine spring lately for the creamery at Moy,\nand it has done well ever since. He can tell of no failure, so far, that he\nhas had. He is a man about fifty years of age, and has a good farm near\nthis, so ho does not do it for money. We will begin, I hope, to dig our well\nsoon, and I will let you know how it gets on. The spring, he asserts, begins\non a hill, and continues all down the field and up to the house, I suppose\n400 yards or more, and that it could be tapped anywhere we choose.\nC. M. Kennedy.\nI have also received other cases where McCrea was successful, but\nhe dislikes using the rod, as he says \"it seems to take such a lot out\nof me.\"\nThrough the kindness of friends I have received some particulars\nof the successful use of the rod for finding underground water by one\nor two other amateur dowsers in Ireland, such as the late Mr. Thos.\nPurvis, of Wexford, of whom Mr. J. Haughton, of Ferns, co. Wexford,\ninforms me that Mr. Purvis enabled his family to obtain a splendid\nsupply of water on their premises, \" as abundant to-day as forty years\nago when the well was sunk.\"\nColonel King-Harman, of New Castle, Ballymahon, Ireland, is\nanother Irish amateur dowser, and in reply to my inquiries told me\nthat a former steward of his had been a successful dowser in America ;\nColonel King-Harman having kindly obtained the man's address,\nI wrote to him and had the following reply in answer to my\nquestions :\u2014\nWhitfield Farm, Kilmeaden, Co. Waterford, October 30th, 1899.\nMy experience of the divining rod was in Manitoba, Canada. There the\nrod proved successful every time but once, and I have every confidence\nwould have done so then, but we struck on a vein of sand, and tho well\nwould not hold out.\nI dug one well where other twelve were dry, and this one had abundance\n[of water] ; it was finished by Government. Other six wells I dug myself\nout there, on the condition that if no water, no wage. All that I had to\nguide me was the rod, and in all those places water was scarce.\nI cannot give the addresses of all I dug for, but by writing to Mr.\nAngus, postmaster, Logoch, Manitoba (for whom I dug the first well), you\ncan have the names of all the places.\nI have tried the rod in Co. Waterford for Major Chavasse on very dry\nhilly ground ; he has not yet dug.\nI have no special feeling in my hands or body when the rod turns.\nGeorge Mitchell.\nIn Bibby's Quarterly (a farming journal) for November, 1897, is an\nillustrated account of a Cornish dowser named George Williams, who\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 229\nlives at Falmouth. It seems he accidentally discovered that the rod\nmoved in his hands, and was successful in tracing a lode by its means.\nSubsequently he used it for water, and several cases of his success are\nquoted. I wrote to the author of the article for further particulars,\nand had the following reply : \u2014\nRosvean, Falmouth, Cornwall, January 26th, 1898.\nGeorge Williams has recently found a spring for me in the country near\nFalmouth. It was not where I had hoped or wanted, but his hazel rod\npointed where the spring was. I was present while he walked all over the\nfield. The work, he says, is always very exhausting to him. The spring, a\nfine jet of water in the rock, was found 28 feet below the surface. No one\npresent knew anything about a watercourse there, and there was nothing to\nsuggest it.\nThe spring at the vicarage (built on the hill at Budock) was 70 feet below\nthe surface ; it was also found by Williams. Rtthaw F C v\nIn a subsequent letter Miss Gay tells me that in sinking her well,\na solid slaty rock was encountered and dynamite had to be used ; the\nwater, when reached at a depth of 28 ft. was so abundant that \"even\nthrough the drought of last summer it was never below 6 or 7 ft.\"\nI visited Falmouth and saw the place where Williams found a\nwater supply for Miss Gay. It certainly seemed an unlikely spot, on\ndry rocky ground between Budock and Penjerrick : the geological\nformation is a clay slate (Devonian), near its junction with the\ngranite ; as Mr. Westlake remarks, \" water tends to run off the\ngranite into the fissures of these slaty rocks, affording an excellent\ntesting ground for the dowser \" ; here and there the water makes\nits way to the surface as seen by certain \" springs \" marked on the\nmap not far distant. I had an interview with Williams ; he is a\nworking man, a mason, and, like other dowsers, has the most child\nlike faith in the indications of his \" rod \" : he showed me several\ntestimonials from gentlemen in Cornwall who spoke highly of his\nservices in finding water on their estates. But I had no opportunity\nof making a personal investigation of any of these cases. Miss Gay\nstates that Williams has been engaged by the Great Western Railway\nCompany to \" dowse \" at Truro for water and that he has worked with\nsuccess for the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on various occasions.\nAmong the dowsers with whom I have had some correspondence is\nMr. H. A. Canning, who is a sanitary and hydraulic engineer at\nMarket Lavington, Wiltshire. Mr. Canning tells me that seeing a\ndowser at work some twenty-five years ago he tried his hand, and\ndiscovered that the forked twig \" worked \" equally well with him. He\nencloses me a list of names of gentlemen for whom he has been\nsuccessful in finding water by the indication of the twig. In one case\n\f230 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nthe twig moved at a spot between two wells 100 ft. apart, which gave\nlittle or no water ; on sinking at the spot indicated, an abundant supply\nwas obtained. This may be so, but I have not verified the statements.\nMr. Canning, in a letter to the Standard in January, 1889, states that\nupon finding the rod suddenly move at a certain spot he was then\nblindfolded, and again on traversing the same spot the rod moved.\nHe adds there was an unmistakable but indescribable feeling upon\napproaching the spot beneath which underground water existed, a\nsensation that could not possibly be avoided, even though an effort was\nmade to do so. It is certainly a remarkable circumstance, whether\nthis sensation be illusory or not, that for 200 years the great majority\nof dowsers in all parts of the world have quite independently asserted\nthe same thing, and as a rule believed that this peculiar sensation, or\nmalaise, existed only in their own case.\nAn interesting account of.an East Anglian dowser, Mr. Child,\nrecently appeared in the Eastern Daily Press. Mr. Child, who was\nformerly in business in Norwich, now lives near Hadleigh in Suffolk,\nand, like the majority of dowsers, was originally a Somersetshire man.\nWhen living near Wells in Somerset he saw a dowser at work, and\nwas greatly astonished to find the rod twisted round in his own hand\nat the same places. Several instances of his success are given in the\nnewspaper report referred to, but these I have not attempted to verify.\nI have already mentioned a Cheddar dowser named Thomas\nPavey (p. 191 J.1 The son, Rowland Pavey, of Cheddar Mill, is also a\ndowser, but has lately abandoned the use of the forked twig, and\ntrusts to what he calls a \"New Science\" in his water-finding ex\npeditions. What this mysterious science is he does not tell the\npublic. I have had some correspondence with Pavey, and his letters\nare full of rhodomontade. Though he will not tell me what his\nwonderful secret is, he assures me it is \" a science of sciences, and\nto keep it secret is keeping hid a field of wonderful discoveries that\ncannot be exhausted by scientists, as it is, I believe, the outcome\nof a higher state of civilisation.\" (!) In a printed circular he sends\nme he states that, though his science is in a crude state, yet the\n\" science of geology will be surpassed, the uplifting of mountains\nand what lies hidden far beneath will be understood. There will\nbe no more secrets in water-finding, and the human body will be\nunderstood as it never was before,\" beside a multitude of other\nrevelations, which he enumerates, ranging over the universe ! In\nspite of all this nonsense, the Rev. H. H. Streeten, who writes to\n1 F. H. Pavey, p. 234, another Cheddar dowser, is a connection of these Paveys.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 231\nme from Easton Vicarage, near Wells, tells me, in answer to my\ninquiries, that \"Pavey certainly has a remarkable knowledge of the\nearth. How he has acquired this knowledge is a different question,\nbut in localities he has never before visited he will in a short time\ntell you where the springs of water are, and generally he will say\nat what depth water is to be found underground. He is a quiet,\nnice-minded man.\" Mr. Westlake, who has visited Pavey, says he\nis a genuine enthusiast, with a firm belief in his \" gift.\" The follow\ning report of an eye-witness describes how Pavey usually goes to\nwork in determining the depth at which water would be found under\nground. In this particular case\u2014\nHe knelt down on one knee with his head resting on one hand, and gazed\ndownwards for about half-a-minute, afterwards giving it as his opinion that\nit would be necessary to go down approximately 60 ft. As he predicted, a\ngood spring was struck within a few inches of the depth mentioned. The\nsupply is plentiful, as is evidenced by the fact that, after it had been left\nduring the night, three hours were occupied in getting sufficient water out\nof the well to enable a commencement to be made in lining it with brick.\nThere is, however, no evidence to show he was not aware of the\ndepth of other local wells.\nHowever striking some of these cases of the success of the dowser\nmay appear to the lay mind, to an expert field geologist, who knows\nthe district, the explanation is often simple enough. Here, for example,\nis a case in point. Mrs. Hollands, of Dene Park, Tonbridge, kindly\nsent me an account of the success which attended the dowser (Mr.\nGataker) at her place, but informed me they had not made any\nprevious attempts to find water, and adds :\u2014\nDene Park, Tonbridge, October 17th, 1899.\nWe dug in two places, and found water about the depth he [the dowser]\ntold us\u2014fifteen to twenty-five feet. Two of these wells are now most valu\nable, in these long seasons of drought. Without them we should not have\nenough water to supply the house at all. MmNIE HoLL4HD8-\nMr. Holmes, F.G.S., remarks on this case :\u2014\nAt Dene Park, near Tonbridge, a gravel patch capping the Weald Clay\nseems to have been tapped. I learn from Topley's Geological Survey\nMemoir on the Weald (1875) that there are many outlying patches of gravel\nat high levels in that district. Dene Park is rather more than two miles\nnorth of Tonbridge. Gravel patches are mentioned (p. 185) as existing near\nStarve Crow Farm (about half-a-mile south-east of the house at Dene Park)\nand east of Little Park (about a quarter of a mile north of Dene Park). The\ndowser would need simply a good eye for contours, as in the Oxford case.\nT. V. H.\n\f232 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nIn addition to the cases which I have already cited, I have before\nme a number of other illustrations of the dowser's success in finding\nwater, and very often correctly estimating the depth at which it would\nbe found. In these cases, however, the replies I have received to my\ninquiries have shown that no previous attempt to obtain a water\nsupply had been made, and several state that water would probably\nhave been found without the dowser's aid, only they wanted to \"make\nsure \" before sinking a well. This correspondence has also shown\nhow misleading are many of the reports appearing in some of the\nprovincial newspapers. These reports doubtless give the dowser's own\nversion of the matter. To quote a typical instance, the Bath Chronicle,\nwhich appears to be Mr. Gataker's favourite organ, contains two\nmisleading statements in its issue of October 22nd, 1896. One is as\nfollows :\u2014\nAnother striking testimony to the ability of Mr. Leicester Gataker, the\nwater expert, of Bath, has just come to hand. In the face of much\nscepticism he recently undertook to supply Mr. Smith Barry, M.P., Cor-\ndangan Manor, near Tipperary, [with water] for the purposes of a dairy, on\nspecial terms of \"no water, no pay.\" He foreshadowed 300 gallons an\nhour at from 25 to 35 ft. deep. On this he at once started his men to carry\nout the sinking of the well. At a depth of 32 ft. a supply of 400 gallons\nhas been obtained as a result.\nI wrote to the Right Hon. Smith Barry for information, and his\nestate agent (Mr. G. C. Townsend) replies that \" the results of Mr.\nGataker's work here have not been sufficiently successful to justify me\nin giving you the information you ask.\"\nThe other statement, a few lines above in the same paper, is as\nfollows :\u2014\nMr. G. Marshall, of Sarnesfield Court, Herefordshire, was getting pretty\nwell tired of well-sinking at the time he engaged the services of Mr.\nLeicester Gataker, but his latest move has been most successful.\nIn reply to my inquiries Mr. Marshall states that he sunk no wells\nbefore Mr. Gataker's visit, but simply made \" catch-pits \" to collect\nsurface water. In further correspondence Mr. Marshall informs me :\u2014\nHeralds' College, London, E.C., October IQik, 1899.\nIn reply to your questions\u2014\n1 and 2. Before Mr. Gataker found water for me at Sarnesfield I had\nbuilt a large tank and attempted to collect surface water, which failed me in\na dry season.\n3. Mr. Gataker came and indicated two spots within a short distance of\nmy tank, telling the number of feet to sink the wells and the amount of\nwater I should find. His estimate was perfectly correct, and since I have\nhad the wells sunk I have had a most satisfactory supply. The late dry\nsummer has been a severe test, but there has been a full supply of water,\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 233\n\u25a0\nand I have no reason to believe there will ever be otherwise. It is curious\nhow many people appear to have the power of water finding did they know\nhow to use it. Several of us tried when Mr. Gataker was at Sarnesfield, and\nwhen he placed a twig in their hands it moved, but with myself, although\nMr. Gataker gripped me firmly by the wrists, there was no movement.\nGeorge W. Marshall.\nSarnesfield is near Weobley, about ten miles north-west of Hereford.\nI asked Mr. Marshall what was the need of a dowser, as probably\nsurface water would be found anywhere in shallow wells at Sarnesfield.\nHe replies :\u2014\nHeralds' College, London, E.C., October 19th, 1899.\nOf course, on a soil like ours at Sarnesfield, which is on stone, you can\nget water anywhere when you get down to the rock ; but the point which\nshows Gataker's skill is that being told whereabouts (a mile and a half from\nmy house) I wanted water found, he fixed the spots to sink the wells, and\ntold accurately the depth to go and the quantity of water which would be\nGeorge W. Marshall.\nMr. Holmes remarks :\u2014\nThe Gataker cases are an excellent illustration\u2014as you remark\u2014of the\ndeceitfulness of newspaper reports. Mr. Marshall's second letter reduces\nvery considerably the atmosphere of wonder enveloping the first.\nT. V. H.\nMuch of the wonder which the dowser creates, in the unscientific\nmind, arises from the notion which he invariably fosters that under\nground water is found in narrow streams or \" springs,\" and that\nwithout his aid in hitting upon the exact spot where to sink a well,\nthe chances are you would have missed the water altogether. It is\ntrue that in certain districts the geological formation causes under\nground water to be found in fissures or narrow streams, and there, as\nI have said before, the real test of the dowser is to be found. Such a\nformation prevails in the county of Somerset, as Mr. Westlake has\nshown in his instructive Appendix (p. 315). In the next Part, I\nhave cited some failures of dowsers and the probable percentage of\nsuccesses they obtain. It must, however, be clearly understood that\nneither in this Report, nor in the previous one, have I selected favour\nable cases and omitted others which were adverse. Every case that\nhas reached me has, as far as possible, been investigated, either by\ncorrespondence with the person who employed the dowser, or by a visit\nto the spot by my geological friends.\n\f234 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nPART VIII.\nProfessional Dowsers in England and \"Wales and their\nProbable Percentage of Failures.\n\u00a7 1. List of Dowsers and Hints as to their Employment.\nIt may be convenient in concluding this part of our work, to\nappend a list of professional dowsers in England and Wales. The\nstronghold of the dowser is to be found in those districts where the\ngeological formation renders it difficult to discern underground sources\nof water, such, for example, as in the Lower Lias and amid the lime\nstone regions of Somerset and Gloucestershire and in the South of\nFrance. In and around Cheddar there are numerous professional\ndowsers ; to some of these I have already referred. With the help\nof Mr. Westlake I have drawn up the following list of professional\ndowsers now living in England and Wales. No doubt there are\nseveral others of whom I have not heard, and there are, of course, in\naddition numbers of amateur dowsers, some of whom have been\nremarkably successful. It will be noticed that even in this im\nperfect list no less than eighteen professional dowsers are found in\nSomersetshire, more than half the total ; and several who now live\nelsewhere, such as Mr. Child and Mr. Stears, originally came from\nSomersetshire.\nDowsers in Somersetshire :\u2014\nJ.

The list of Somerset dowsers might no doubt be easily\nextended by further inquiry, t.g., George Elson, labourer at North Perroth, p. 205.\n\f236 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\n(2) If a large supply is wanted and a deep artesian well or boring\nto be made eschew all dowsers and consult a good hydro-geologist.1\n(3) If only a moderate supply is required, \u2014-especially in certain\nformations where geology is of little help,\u2014select a couple of dowsers\nof good repute, and let each give his opinion unknown to and inde\npendently of the other.2\n(4) As the best dowsers I know have been more or less illiterate\nmen, their loss of time would be amply repaid by offering them a\nmoderate fee and travelling expenses.\n(5) If the water-finder is willing to sink or bore on the faith of his\nopinion, obtain his estimate, and if found to be reasonable, offer him\nso much per cent, extra on the condition of \" no water no pay,\" taking\ncare to have a written agreement as to the limit of expense involved.8\nWhat this extra percentage should be depends on the geological con\nditions. Taking the country indiscriminately, 15 per cent, would\nprobably be reasonable, but if \"fissure water\" (see p. 341) pre\ndominates, and moreover, if geological advice has already been sought\nand on trial has proved a failure, an extra rate of 25 per cent. is not\nunreasonable, if a certain supply be stipulated for.\n\u00a7 2. Recent Cases of Complete or Partial Failure in Water-Finding\nby English Dowsers.\nThough nearly every professional dowser thinks he can be no more\nmistaken in trusting to the twisting of his rod for the indication of\nunderground water, than a magnet can be mistaken in its selective\nattraction of iron, yet it is hardly necessary to say the dowser is by no\nmeans free from mistakes. He has his failures, sometimes costly\nfailures to those who employ him. Several of his failures I detailed\n1 Mr. Westlake, F.G.S., in reference to this adds the following note:\u2014 \"Even\nwhere deep wells are necessary, experience has shown it is sometimes advantageous\nto supplement geological advice by calling in a dowser, for, though a definite water\nlevel may exist, the quantity found at a given spot is often a matter of chance : such\na case I saw recently near Newbury, where the dowser, Tompkins, had found, at a\ndepth of over 100 ft. in the chalk, so large a supply that steam pumping-gear had to\nbe used, whereas in two or three other wells in the neighbourhood, with water at\nabout the same hydrostatic level, the quantity was much less. It is difficult, how\never, to say how far chance coincidence may account for such lucky hits.\"\n2 On the question of independent exammation by different dowsers, see Part IV.,\nand also the last sentence but one in Professor de Mortillet's letter, p. 244.\n3 The reason for this will be seen in the next few pages. The dowser will usually\nmake a rough estimate of the quantity of water likely to be found and the depth at\nwhich it exists ; with some dowsers this estimate is often wonderfully close, with\nothers it is as often wrong. It is desirable, therefore, to bear this in mind and also\nthat the quantity of water yielded by all shallow wells varies largely with the season\nof the year.\n\fxxxviil] On the So-called Divining Rod. 237\nin the previous Report, and I will here cite a few more that I have\nsince met with ; others of course exist that I have not heard of. But\nwhilst I have been obliged to omit numerous instances of the dowsers'\nsuccess which were of no evidential value, I have not omitted any of\ntheir failures which were verified upon inquiry ; meaning by failure,\ncomplete disappointment of the expectations raised by the water-finder.\nAs I have quoted an instance of Mr. Gataker's success at Aspley\nHeath, p. 185, here is an instance of his failure in the same neighbour\nhood. It is contained in a letter to Mr. Myers from a friend of his\n\u2014the daughter of a former Professor at Cambridge\u2014-who writes most\nindignantly, and states that Mr. Gataker's predictions were not in any\nway fulfilled. The place is at Woburn Sands, and it seems that before\nGataker's visit a well had been dug about 70 ft. deep in the Oxford\nclay without finding water. When Mr. Gataker came, he fixed upon a\nspot where he said a large water supply would be obtained\u2014at what\ndepth is not stated. A well was dug and only a little water obtained,\neven when headings were driven radiating from the sides of the well.\nThe writer of the letter suggests that the investigation of every\ndowser should be confined to the question of whether \" he ever made a\nmistake, for if water were not found in the place and at the depth\npredicted by the diviner, I should consider him an impostor.\" I am\nafraid this \" short way \" with dowsers would not carry the investigation\nvery far. The writer concludes by expressing a wish to write to the\nSpectator \" on the wickedness of diviners and the extraordinary folly\nand credulousness of educated persons in believing in them.\"\nOther dowsers besides Mr. Gataker have their share of failures, in\nspite of all their attempts to explain them away. Here is a case of the\ndiscomfiture of another dowser, related in detail in the Daily Mail for\nDecember 28th, 1897. It seems that a member of the Legislative\nCouncil of Jamaica, whilst on a visit to England, engaged the services\nof a \"diviner\" to locate the site for wells in a district in Jamaica\nwhich had suffered greatly from the neod of a water supply. Handsome\nterms were offered by five parochial boards in Jamaica to the water-\nfinder, who on his arrival in their neighbourhood was received with\nenthusiasm, and very soon, by means of his rod, pointed out several\nplaces where water would be found.\nAt Mandeville, a charming village in the hills, he pegged out part of the\ncourse of a subterranean stream and retired to lunch at a neighbouring\nhotel. In his absence some wags removed his pegs and lined out a totally\ndifferent course. On his return the diviner took up the new direction and\ncontinued it for over a hundred yards more, and did not discover his\nmistake until one of his admirers pointed out the deception. But no\nborings for water had yet been made, and the authoritative statements\nof the diviner were unchallenged. At length the necessary implements\n\f238 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nwere obtained, and an attempt was made at several points to reach the\nwater so confidently indicated. At one point where water was predicted as\nat a depth of 40 ft., a boring of 150 ft. was made, with the only result that\nno water could be found, the machinery eventually broke down, and after\ngoing down about 200 ft., the borer could not be extracted. The same\nridiculous result occurred in other places, and up to the present at none of\nthe points indicated by the diviner has water been found.\nLike all other newspaper reports, this needs confirmation, but it is\nno doubt fairly correct. In 1897, Mr. Stears informed me he had entered\ninto a contract to dowse for water in Jamaica, and he no doubt was\nthe unfortunate dowser employed. Nor is this the only costly failure\nhe, as well as some other dowsers, have had.\nIn the previous Report (p. 173) I gave some details of a failure on\nthe part of Mr. Stears which led the Parish Council of Bardney,\nLincolnshire, to a very heavy and useless expenditure. At a spot in\ndicated by the dowser they bored to a great depth and found no water.\nI have since heard from Mr. Hind, the Clerk to the District Council,\nwho informs me they continued boring to a depth of 450 ft., at a cost\nof \u00a3300, and found no water. The bore-hole then caved in. Bardney\nis about ten miles east of Lincoln.\nAs I have pointed out again and again, whatever success attends the\ndowser is mainly due to his discovery of a moderate water supply yielded\nby comparatively shallow borings or wells, i.e., from 15 to 50 ft. deep\n(see previous Report, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 235, 240, etc.).\nHence it is a great pity that District and County Councils, when they\nwant a large water supply, do not consult a good hydro-geologist.\nMr. C. E. de Ranee, F.G.S., one of the best authorities on water\nsupply, published in 1891 an admirable paper on The Underground\nWaters of Lincolnshire, which I recommend to the Bardney District\nCouncil. They will find in it a record of deep borings not far from\ntheir own town.\nAnother case, more or less a failure, in which Mr. Stone was the\ndowser, has reached me from Messrs. Attenborough and Timms, of\nNorthampton. They had originally sunk and bored to a depth of\n70 ft. at Dassett Sidings, near Burton (between Fenny Compton and\nKineton railway stations), and found no water. Mr. Stone was then\nengaged, and with his rod fixed on a place 125 yds. distant where\nhe stated water would be found: \"a sufficient supply, he thought,\nwould be reached at 90 ft., but the exact depth he could not say.\"\nHere Messrs. Attenborough bored to a depth of over 100 ft. ; near\nthe surface, as Stone had said, a little water was met with, but on\ntesting with an artesian pump at the greater depth, \" the result was\nunsuccessful,\" and in a recent letter to me (June, 1900) Messrs.\nAttenborough state : \" We spent a great deal more money than we\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 239\nwere given to understand would be necessary, and, seeing no prospect\nof success, stopped the work after boring to over 100 ft.\"\nMany of the professional dowsers undertake the work of sinking\nor boring for water at the spot they have selected, and, as in the\nabove case, frequent disputes arise from this cause, the dowser wanting\nto go on boring, at his customer's expense, when he fails to obtain an\nadequate supply of water at or beyond the depth he estimated. It is\nnecessary, therefore, to warn all those who intend employing a dowser\nas well-sinker to make a definite arrangement beforehand, such as I\nhave suggested on p. 236.\nMr. Westlake, in the course of his investigations in the south-west\nof England, heard of some half-dozen cases of expensive failures on\nthe part of the dowsers there employed ; particulars of these cases\nand the names of the dowsers have not yet reached me. Mr. Gordon\nHarris, A.M. Inst. C.E., in a useful paper on \"Water Supply to\nCountry Mansions,\" read before the United Service Institution on\nDecember 4th, 1899, after referring to dowsing for water and my\nprevious Report on this subject, mentions a case where a dowser\npredicted a water supply at 160 ft. depth on an estate in Hertford\nshire. Mr. Harris, being consulted, showed that as the London clay\nhad here to be pierced to reach the chalk, no water could be found\nunder 200 ft. ; a boring was made at the spot and geology triumphed.\nMr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., in his excellent paper on the Divining\nRod published in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute for\nNovember, 1897, to which I have already referred, mentions three or\nfour cases where dowsers had partially or completely failed ; two of\nthese I referred to in the previous Report (p. 236),\u2014(1) one was when\nMr. Tompkins was employed at Porthcawl in Glamorganshire ; the\ngeological formation at this place is, I find, some 15 to 20 ft. of red\nmarl and shale, resting on a deep bed of Triassic Conglomerate ; (2)\nthe other case was at Ampthill in Bedfordshire, where 10 to 20 ft. of\nthe lower Greensand rest on a bed of Jurassic clay over 500 ft. thick.\nIn both these cases, as might be expected geologically, a small supply\nof water was found not far below the surface, and no increased supply\nafter boring to a much greater depth.\nThese two partial failures are of considerable public interest, as the\ndowsers were in each case engaged by the respective District Councils,\nand the costs incurred were disallowed by the auditors to the Local\nGovernment Board. In reporting the case the local newspapers state\nthat :\u2014\nMr. W. A. Casson, the Local Government Board auditor, in giving his\ndecision, quoted Professor Barrett, who had written a monograph \" On the\nSo-called Divining Rod,\" which was published in the Proceedings of the\nSociety for Psychical Research. Though apparently strongly biassed in\n\f240 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nfavour of diviners, Professor Barrett admitted that their general ideas of\nwater were absurd, as they imagined springs to exist like buried treasure,\nlocated to an area of a few square inches, or as underground rivers which\nthey professed to trace within an inch on either side. He (Mr. Casson)\nregarded divination as a survival from times when magic and witchcraft were\ngenerally believed in.\nLike many others, Mr. Casson was misled by the name divining\nrod ; he should, however, be more careful in his official utterances ; if\nhe had read my report, he could hardly have made the foolish statement\nthat I was \"strongly biassed\"; a judge or a jury are not said to be\nbiassed when they arrive at a decision after patiently hearing the\nevidence on both sides that has been brought before them.\nThe reason assigned by the auditors for their decision was that the\ndiviners made a pretence of claiming some supernatural power in\nfinding underground water (this is a mistake ; no dowsers claim such\npower ; \" abnormal \" is meant), and it was stated the judges had laid\ndown that\n\" the pretence of a power, whether moral, physical, or supernatural, with\nintent to obtain money, was sufficient to constitute an offence within the\nmeaning of the law.\"\nThe fees charged by the dowsers were therefore illegal, as they\ncould not be recovered in a court of law. In addition, the Porthcawl\nauditor surcharged the District Council with the expenditure on the\nboring, amounting to over \u00a3500.1 Throughout England and Wales\nthe public interest excited in the matter was great. I received nearly\n100 cuttings from various newspapers relating to the subject ; the\neditors for the most part lamenting the benighted and superstitious\npractices of the Porthcawl and Ampthill councillors. \" It is im\npossible,\" said the Leeds Mercury in reference to this case, \" to\nplumb the depths of human credulity.\"2 But the surcharged Councils\nappealed, and ultimately, in answer to a question in the House of\nCommons, on August 7th, 1899, the President of the Local Govern\nment Board, the Right Hon. J. Chaplin, upset many beliefs by stating\nthat the appeals were allowed and the auditors' decisions reversed,\n\" the Board having been advised by their own legal adviser that the\nreasons assigned by the auditors for making the disallowances did\nnot support the action they took in point of law.\" Hence, after\n1 Subsequently, the auditor must have amended his decision in respect to this, for\naccording to Mr. Chaplin's statement in the House of Commons, the only sums\ndisallowed were the small amounts for the diviner's fees. The best accounts of the\nPorthcawl case will be found in the lengthy reports in the Cardiff Western Mail for\nJuly 20th, 1897. el acq. The Ampthill case will be found fully reported in the Bedford\nTimes for June 5th, 1897, ct \u00bbtq.\n2 A few exceptions to this general outcry were to be found in some journals,\nnotably Truth, the Eeening Standard, and the Local Goeernment Journal.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 241\nthis, Urban and Rural District Councils are left free to employ any\ncompetent water-tinder they choose to select, whatever method he may\nemploy. This is surely a wise decision, founded, I expect, less upon\nlegal views than upon the experience which Mr. Chaplin and other\nmembers of the Government have had of the usefulness of dowsers\non their own estates.\n$ 3. Percentage of Failures.\nThis leads on to the question of the percentage of failures of different\ndowsers. I have tried to obtain from some of the professional \" water-\nfinders \" a record of all the places they have visited in the course of say\ntwelve months, so that by inquiry at each place I might ascertain the\nnumber of successes and of failures. But it is impossible to know if\nthe record sent is a complete one. I have received from two dowsers a\nlong list of persons and places, and have written to each person named\nwith the result that all these cases were more or less successful, but the\nfailures are just the ones that are not likely to be sent. Mr. Gataker\nfrankly says in a letter to me that he has had occasional failures, which\nhe cannot account for except by his state of health. The dowser very\noften explains away a failure by saying the depth is merely greater and\nthe quantity of water less than he predicted, but all depends upon how\nmuch greater depth or how much less water. It would be much better\nif each dowser would keep a faithful record of all his engagements, and\nthen take the public into his confidence, and give the results of his\nwork and references to each of his employers. This, I suppose, we\ncan hardly expect in the present state of human nature.\nAn estimate of the number of failures on the part of professional\ndowsers may perhaps be obtained from the extra charge some of them\nmake when sinking wells on the \" no water, no pay \" system. That is\nto say, they agree to sink a well for a certain sum at the spot they\nhave selected by the rod, and if water is not found at the place they\npredicted, and in about the quantity they estimated, then no charge is\nmade ; the loss falls on the dowser. If however, all turns out satis\nfactorily, a somewhat higher charge is made for sinking the well than\nan ordinary well-sinker would charge, or if no guarantee be given by\nthe dowser. This extra charge varies with different dowsers, and is of\ncourse their insurance against failure; it expresses, however, something\nirvrre than the percentage of absolute failures, for water may be found,\nbut the supply may be insufficient, or the depth may be greater than\nwas allowed for in the contract.\nI have inquired what this extra charge is, and, as might be ex\npected, it varies. Mr. Gataker makes an additional charge of 25 per\ncent. on the \" no water no pay \" system ; a similar additional rate is, I\nT\n\f242 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nunderstand, charged by Mr. Chesterman ; l Mr. Tompkins in reply to\nmy inquiry, says: \"25 to 30 per cent. extra would cover the risk\"; Mr.\nStone says he does not work on that system, but would be willing to\nundertake work on the terms of only charging out of pocket expenses,\nin addition to his fee, if water is not found.2 The late John Mullins\n(see p. 75 of my previous Report) made no extra charge, and (as a rule)\nwas willing to forego all payments if after sinking the well a sufficient\nsupply of water was not found. His sons, who carry on the business,\nand one of whom is a dowser (see p. 98 of last Report), inform me \"we\ndo not generally make any extra charge for giving a guarantee of find\ning water ; on three occasions only we charged 15 per cent, extra on the\ncontract for making the well.\" They enclose me copies of some of their\ncontracts for large amounts; several of these, I notice, contain the clause\n\"in the event of not obtaining a supply of 1,000 gallons per day of\ntwenty-four hours, we will make no charge for the work done.\" But a\nthousand gallons per day is a very small supply for expensive operations,\nand contaminated surface water might easily yield this amount.\nI am inclined to think we may take from 10 to 15 per cent, as\nthe average percentage of failures which occur with most English\ndowsers of to-day, allowing a larger percentage for partial failures,\nmeaning by this that the quantity of water estimated and the\ndepth at which it is found have not realised the estimate formed\nby the dowser. This latter, however, though of great practical\nimportance, is foreign to our inquiry, for what we want to know is\nwhether, after making every allowance for shrewdness of eye, chance\ncoincidence, and local or geological knowledge, the dowser has any\ninstinctive or supernormal power of discovering the presence of under\nground water. The answer to this question is to be found by a study\nof the cases cited in this and the previous Report, and is discussed in\na subsequent Part (p. 303). Here I will only add that the reader\nwho has followed me will have seen how absurd is the dowser's notion\nthat the mere twisting of his forked twig is an infallible indication of\nunderground water. As I have already shown (Vol. XIII., p. 253),\nthe movement of the twig is due to a sub-conscious suggestion, and\nthis may arise from many causes besides the assumed influence of\nunderground water on the dowser.\n1 In a recent contract between the District Council at East Knoyle and the\ndowser, Chesterman, so many gallons per twenty-four hours were stipulated for, and\na certain depth not to be exceeded. The contract was taken at ordinary ratei',\nChesterman to receive 25 per cent. extra if he succeeds and to pay all if he fails : as\nthe District Council have, I understand, already lost \u00a3150 over a well sunk upon\ngeological advice, they have made a good bargain.\n2 This is a most unsatisfactory arrangement, for the dowser, being the contractor,\nmakes himself the judge of what is an adequate supply of water and what the depth\nof the boring should be. I have heard some complaints of Mr. Stone in this respect.\n\fXXXVin.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 243\nPART IX.\nContinental, Colonial, and Californian Cases of the Use of the\nRod in the Search for Underground Water.\n\u00a7 1. Continental Dowsers.\nIn the previous Report, on p. 23, I mentioned that a French writer\nhad published in 1850 a little book called Hixtoire de VHydroscopie et\nde la Baguette Divinatoire, and I spoke of the author, who was in\nearly life a successful and, I believe, professional dowser, as \"a M.\nMortillet.\" I was unaware at the time that the author was the same\nperson as Professor Gabriel de Mortillet, who has a European reputa\ntion, and is one of the most distinguished anthropologists in France.\nI therefore owe an apology to Professor de Mortillet, and expressed\nthis in sending him a copy of the Report. It is often remarked\nthat it would be of great value if a competent scientific man were\nalso a dowser, and could give us his personal experience. Here we\nhave a case in point, and to this may be added the case of Mr.\nEnys, F.G.S., the President of the Royal Geological Society of Corn\nwall, a letter from whom is quoted on p. 219. Professor de Mortillet's\nlittle book is not now accessible ; the author, in reply to my inquiries,\nwrites to me as follows :\u2014\nSt. Germain-en-Laye, pres Paris, 18 Decembre, 1897.\nJe regrette beaucoup de ne pas pouvoir vous envoyer mon HLstoire de\nHydroscopie. Je n'en possede pas meme un exemplaire choz moi. Je vais\nm'informer s'il en existe encore.

F. B.\nT 2\n\f244 Professor W. F. Barrett. [PART\nAs the summary Professor de Mortillet gives of his views on the\nbaguette is of general interest, I append the following translation of the\ncommunication he refers to in L'A\/as, February, 1S96 :\u2014\nThe name \"hydroscope \" has been given to those persons who experience\ncertain special sensations on passing over subterranean watercourses.\nSometimes, though very rarely, the sensation is sufficiently strong fur the\nsubject to be directly conscious of it. In most cases hydroscopes are\ncompelled to use an instrument in order to recognise the fact. The instrument\nemployed is either a pendulum (pendule) or a rod. The pendulum is carried\nin the hand, so that the least trembling of the arm sets it in motion. As to\nthe rod, it is a twig slightly bent, which the operator rests upon the index\nfingers of each hand so as to balance it. The least motion of the fingers\ntowards or away from each other is then sufficient to displace the centre\nof gravity, which, passing from the centre of the rod towards the ends,\nand from the ends towards the centre, naturally causes the rod to turn. But\nthis is not the true divining rod. This last is a stem, dividing into two\nbranches nearly of equal size, and forming as acute an angle as possible.\nThe end of a branch is grasped in each hand, and it is bent back in such a\nmanner as to be in tension (resisting the pressure of the hand). These\nrecurved and bent branches endeavour to spring back to their original\nstraight line, which causes their point of union to move. To use this rod,\nan equilibrium as unstable as possible is set up, so that it may be disturbed\nby the least nervous jar, which will cause the instrument to move Such are\nthe principles governing the pendulum and the rod. The nature of the\nwood is a matter of indifference. Hazel is preferred, because it forks more\nfrequently, and the rods are more flexible than is the case with other trees.\nPendulums and rods move over certain points in the hands of persons\nwho are especially sensitive. These points are supposed to be over under\nground watercourses. As a matter of fact, this is generally, but not always,\nthe case. I have seen important works undertaken merely upon indications\nfurnished by hydroscopy, with full success. But, at other times, I have seen\nit fail.\nThis much, however, is certain, which I can affirm as the result of\nexperience, that the point chosen by one diviner will also be chosen by\nothers brought from a distance, and completely ignorant of the preceding\nexperiments. A real phenomenon to study does therefore exist.\nWhat has discredited this phenomenon is the attempt to employ it in\nmoral matters, such as the search for robbers, assassins, etc.\nI would call special attention to the penultimate paragraph, as\nexpressing the opinion of a distinguished man of science who knows\nwhat he is talking about.\nIt will be noticed that Professor de Mortillet refers to the use of a\npendule as well as a baguette.1 The former is not, I believe, anywhere\n1 I have referred to the so-called pendule cxploratiur in the previous Report,\np. 10. It consists simply of a ring or little ball, suspended by a thread which is held\nbetween the fingera, and, thus held, the involuntary motion of the hand sets it\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-culled Divining Rod. 245\nemployed by dowsers in England, but it is in use in some parts of\nAmerica, and is described in an article in an American journal, the\nDemocratic Review for 1850 The writer calls himself \" An Old Rods-\nman,\" and states that some diviners in searching for metals use a\nforked twig, or two pieces of whalebone, and others a \"small metallic\nball suspended by a horse-hair or silk thread As the operator\napproaches the hidden mine, the ball deviates more or less from the\nperpendicular, and this points out the proximity of the object sought.\"\nA very similar pendule is referred to in the next case, as employed by\nsome French sourciers, or water tinders. These sourciers, lam informed\nby those in the South of France to whom I have written, are to be\nfound in Dauphine, Savoie, and Beaujolais, but in smaller numbers\nthan formerly. A friend in France writes as follows :\u2014\nLyons, July 2nd, 1898.\nM. Raoul de Cazenove (a relative of Demi Cazenove) lately built himself\na chateau, and after all was finished, found he had everything heart could\ndesire except water. He knew of an old fanner reputed as a \"sourcier,\"\nand went to him. He consented to come, but as he expressed it, \"for\nlove, not for money, as I never intended doing it again ; it exhausts me so\nterribly.\" He came, found, and was exhausted, so much so that they ha 1\nmuch ado to fit him for returning home.\nI wrote to M. de Cazenove, who kindly sent me the following\nparticulars :\u2014\nChateau du Sober, La Salle, Gard, July Uih, 1898.\nI am happy to send you the few particulars I possess on the subject.\nAnswering your two questions, I may say, 1st, since thirty years or so, I\nhave had on many occasions to ask the \"sourciers' \" services. I have asked\ntheir help fourteen times ; their researches have been successful in nine cases.\nOur country is very irregular, abrupt anil rocky ; so no wells have been\nbored. Water is to be found in digging horizontal galleries ; most of these\ngo from twenty to one hundred metres [about 66 to 330 ft. \"J; many are bored\nin granite ; some others in \"calcaire\" [limestone].\n2nd. When I have observed the \"sourcier\" at work he feels a particular\nsensation, or malaise, which increases as he approaches the hidden water.\nSome use a rod ; many of them a heavy watch, hanging by its chain ; some\nof them don't use any instrument. We have a lot of \"sourciers \" in the\ncountry (mountains of the Cevennes) ; some of them are amateurs, many are\nprofessionals. Their estimation of the depth and volume of water is quite\nempirical ; hence mistakes and frequent deceptions result. Sometimes their\noscillating and appears to endow the pcndule with a sort of intelligent activity. A\nconsiderable literature has arisen over the pendule, a toy which afresh excites the\nast nishment of succeeding generations. It is really a simple form of \"autoscope,\"\nand can claim a remote antiquity, divination by an oscillating ring or pcndult having\nbeen used by the ancients ; it was employed by Hilarius in the 4th century to ascer\ntain who would be the successor to Valens ; Chevreul, in his Baguette Divinatoire,\npp. 132 et >eq., gives the whole passage.\n\f246 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nlong experience furnishes them with sufficient indications, but they have no\nrules ; only personal and nervous feeling.\nMany professional \"sourciers\" exist in France in various parts. I\nremain at your disposition for further inquiries.\nR. de Cazenove.\nContinental \" Hydroscopes \" in the Early Part of the Century.\nOne of the most successful water-finders in the early part of the\n19th century was the French Abbe\" Paramelle; he did not employ a rod,\nbut trusted to his instinct, guided by a knowledge of hydro-geology\nwhich he had gained through careful observation. I have devoted an\nAppendix to Paramelle (see p. 352), as his case forms an instructive\ncontribution to our research.\nThe subject of Continental dowsers would be incomplete without\nreference to the writings of Thouvenel, Amoretti, Count Tristan and\nBaron Du Prel. Dr. Thouvenel I have already referred to, and his\nexperiments with the dowser Bleton are given in the next Part.\nThouvenel, towards the close of the 18th century, went to Italy and\nthere experimented with another dowser, or \" hydroscope,\" a lad\nnamed Pennet,1 who professed to find buried metals and coal, as well\nas underground water. Some of the results were so surprising that\nthe great naturalist, Spallanzani, was much impressed, but as Pennet\nwas, according to a letter published by Biot,2 subsequently found\ntricking at Florence, Spallanzani concluded he also had been tricked\nand withdrew his former opinion. I do not know whether Biot had\nreliable evidence for his statement, for we all know that with many\nsceptics any evidence is thought good enough, if it serves to discredit\nphenomena new to science.\nAmoretti, who was an Italian savant of some note, published\nvarious papers on his experiments with the Divining Rod, chiefly with\ntwo dowsers, one the lad Pennet, and the other, a boy, Anfossi.3\nIn Vol. XIX. of the Opuscoli Scelti, Amoretti, in a letter to Fortis,\n1 See an article by Dr. Thouvenel in Melanges d'histoire natnrclh de physique,\netc., Vol. III., Paris, 1807.\n2 Reprinted in 1858 in his Melanges scientifiques et litttraires, tom. II., p. 80.\nIn the Bibliography of the Divining Rod, which Mr. Westlake has with each\nimmense industry prepared, numbers of papers in French, Italian, and German will\nbe found between 1800 and 1810, arising out of Dr. Thouvenel's investigations.\n3 Amoretti's papers on the divining rod, in the British Museum, are mainly found\nin the Soc. Ital. dellc Scitnzt for 1813 and 1816, and earlier papers in the Opuscoli Scclti\nsuite Scicnze from 1 7'J8 to 1804. The later papers were published separately under\nthe title of Delta Rabdornanzia ossia EUttrmiwtria animate. Part I. of this book was\ntranslated into German, and a paper on the same Hubject by J. W. Ritter added,\nwith plates showing various rods held both by hands and feet. Some of Amoretti's\npapers were also translated into French and published in Fortis' Mimoires.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 247\ndated December, 1796, states : (1) That an Augustinian friar had, by\nmeans of the rod, found an underground spring, which had since\nsupplied the country house of Signor Dolbecchi ; (2) that one Sanzio,\na surgeon, found his pulse rose twelve to fifteen beats faster per\nminute when standing over subterranean water ; (3) that an insen\nsitive person holding a divining rod became sensitive and the rod\nmoved, when his hands were held by a sensitive [i.e., a dowser] ; (4)\nparticulars are given of a sensitive (a boy) who could locate under\nground water by his feelings, without using a rod : Pennet and\nAnfossi (other sensitives) also said the same. Amoretti, like Pro\nfessor Sementini, Ritter, and others, believed in the close connection\nof electricity with the movement of the rod. The Count de Tristan\nwas likewise fully convinced of the electric origin of the dowsing\nfaculty; his knowledge of physics was, however, very slight. In 1826\nhe published the result of numerous experiments with the divining\nrod in the valley of the Loire in a book called Recherches sur quelques\nejfluves terrestres. An outline of these experiments is given by Dr.\nMayo, F.R.S., in his excellent book, Truths Contained in Popular\nSuperstitions, and by Chevreul in his Baguette Divinatoire, pp. 122\net seq.\nThe influence of \" suggestion,\" whether conscious or unconscious,\nwas not considered nor guarded against by any of these experimenters,\nnor was the effect of involuntary muscular action sufficiently recog\nnised till later. Hence Amoretti, Ritter, Tristan, and very often\nThouvenel, were led to attribute to animal electricity phenomena that\nwere mainly due to suggestion. Thousands of experiments have been\nmade and volumes written on the divining rod and the pemlule (or\nmagic pendulum), all of which are valueless owing to the non-\nrecognition of this source of error ; I will, however, return to this\nlater on.\nIn the autobiography of that learned and singular man, Zschokke,\nan account is given on p. 143, of several dowsers (or Rhabdomantins,\nas Zschokke calls them) whom he had met in Switzerland ; they are\nto be found, he states, in almost every canton. Dr. Ebel, of Zurich,\na well-known geologist, sent Zschokke one of these dowsers to test ;\nhe adds that the Abbot of St. Urban, in Lucerne, was a successful\ndowser. Zschokke was at first very incredulous, but his incredulity\ndisappeared after the numerous tests to which he subjected a young\nfemale dowser.\nThe German Dowser, Beraz.\nDu Prel, who is best known by his suggestive work, Die Philosophic\nder Mystik (admirably translated into English by Mr. C. C. Massey),\npublished a short essay on the Divining Rod {Die Wiinschelruthe) in\n\f248 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\n1890. In this essay Du Prel gives an account of Beraz, a notable\nGerman dowser. The following is a translation of this part :\u2014\n[In 1888] a friend in the South asked me to call upon Beraz, the spring-\nfinder (who is since dead, but who lived at that time in Munich), and to\nmake arrangements with him. It was necessary to find springs in a newly\nlaid out health resort, which was unprovided with a water supply. My\nfriend gave me (the quite unnecessary) advice, not to consult any learned\nprofessors, etc., on the subject of Beraz. I visited Beraz, and while waiting\nfor his appearance, noticed\u2014amongst others\u2014the portrait of a gentleman\nhanging in the room. This gentleman, Beraz informed me, was his maternal\ngrandfather, Professor Ritter ; I naturally asked whether he were the\nauthor of the Siderixmus, and was answered in the affirmative.1 The\ntestimonials that Beraz received are sufficient testimony to his powers As\nthe subject is one of great interest to the public generally, and to land-\nproprietors especially, I give a few dates of the finding of springs, with the\nplaces at which they were found, and addresses at which any one interested\nmay obtain full proof for the asking :\u2014The Capuchin Monastery on St.\nNicholas-berg in the Wurzburg (1877) ; the Corporation of Gart, near\nTraunstein (1876) ; the Institute of Young Ladies at Altotting (1882) ;\nNarr's Brewery in Zirndorf, near Nurnberg (1875), the Community of\nAlgund, near Meran (1882).\nI have conversed with a person who witnessed one of Beraz's experiments\non an occasion when he announced that there was a spring at a depth of\n80 ft., and the spring was found at 83 ft. I do not doubt but that Beraz was\nsometimes unsuccessful, but, ou the other hand, I am sure that many an\nenlightened corporation has lavished great sums on bringing water to thoir\ntowns, which they might have obtained much more reasonably by employing\na spring-finder.\nIn the London Times for February 11th, 1885, I find the following\naccount of water-finding by Beraz in Bavaria :\u2014\nThe Allgemeine Zeitung gives some interesting particulars of remarkable\nsuccess in indicating the presence of water springs on the part of a man\nnamed Beraz, who seems to be a recognised authority in such matters. The\nscene of his performances was in the Bavarian highlands, at a height of\nmore than 1,300 ft. above the level of the sea. The commune of Rothen-\nberg, near Hirschhorn, suffered greatly from want of water, and invited\nBeraz last autumn to endeavour to find some source of supply for them. He\ninspected the locality one afternoon in presence of the public authorities\nand a reporter of the Allgemeine Zeitung, and announced that water was to\nbe found in certain spots at depths which he stated. The first spot was in the\nlower village, and he gave the likely depth at between 62 ft. and 72 ft., adding\nthat the volume of water which the spring would give would be of about the\ndiameter of an inch and a quarter. After incessant labour for four weeks,\n1 Ritter's Sidcrismua, Du Prel remarks in another place, had lain uncut in the\nPublic Library of Munich from 1808 to 1887, apropos of which he adds very truly\n\" the scepticism of many is merely ignorance.\" Ritter conducted some investigations\non the divining rod in Munich in 1806, with an Italian named Campetti.\u2014W. F.B.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 249\nconsisting mainly of rook blasting, the workmen came on a copious spring\nof water at a depth of almost 67 ft. What he declared about a water source\nfor the upper village was very singular. He pointed to a spot where he\nsaid three watercourses lay perpendicularly under one another, and running\nin parallel courses. The first would be found at a depth of between 22i ft.\nand 26 ft. of about the size of a wheaten straw, and running in the direction\nfrom south-east to north-west. The second lay about 42 ft. deep, was of\nabout the size of a thick quill, and ran in the same direction. The third,\nhe said, lay at a depth of about 56 ft., running in the same direction, and as\nlarge as a man's little finger. The actual results were as follows :\u2014The first\nwatercourse was struck at a depth of 27| ft., running in the direction in\ndicated, and having a diameter of one-fifth of an inch. The workmen came\non the second at a depth of 42J5 ft. ; it had a diameter of i\/5ths of an inch.\nThe third was found at 62| ft. below the surface, and having a diameter of\nyths of an inch\u2014all three running in the direction Beraz had indicated.\nThe statements made by the reporter, who says that he was an eye\nwitness, are so circumstantial that they have the appearance of being\ntrustworthy, but it is to be regretted they were not the subject of\ncareful inquiry and corroboration at the time ; the more so as Iiothen-\nburg is in the very centre of German scientific culture. If any readers\nof this Report, who may be visiting Bavaria, can give me additional\ninformation or*, this case, I should be grateful.1 Assuming the facts to\nbe as stated, they are of the greatest interest and theoretic importance,\nfor this case must be classed along with the Waterford case and a few\nothers of a similar type.\nIn Nasse's Zeilachrift fiir Psychisctw Aertze for 1821, Professor\nD'Outrepont, Ph.D., of VViirzburg, gives some interesting facts con\ncerning a dowser at Malmedy (a town on the Belgian frontier) with\nwhom he was acquainted. Mr. E. T. Bennett has translated Dr\nD'Outrepont's paper, and published an abridgement of it in the S. P. R.\nJournal for June, 1899, p. 83. It is therefore accessible for those\nreaders who wish for further information.\n\u00a7 2. Califomian Dowsers.\nAmid the mass of correspondence which has reached me, often from\ndistant parts, I have had several letters from California, where it\nappears there are several professional ore-tinders and water-finders, or\n\" water witches,\" as they are often locally called.\n1 1 have to thank the Editor of the Times for sending me the editorial address of\nthe Allgemeine Zeitung, to which I wrote in the hope that the reporter referred to\nmight still be on the staff of that paper and able to give me some additional\nconfirmation of his statements. Unfortunately, however, I learnt in reply that this\nwas not the case ; nor could the Editor of the Allcgemeine Zeitnny ascertain who the\nreporter was ; Beraz, he informs me, is dead ( Du Prel had stated this).\n\f250 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nOne correspondent, Mr. B. F. Dixon, of Escondido, California, the\nhead of a firm of orange growers, writes as follows :\u2014\nEscondido, California, Noeember 22nrf, 1897.\nHaving read a review of your treatise on the Divining Rod in the papers\nhere, the following facts may interest you.\nIn the full of 1865 an acquaintance in Kansas had engaged a person to\nlocate a well on his place. The man held a forked peach twig, which moved\nstrongly at a certain spot. Upon my laughing at such utter nonsense, the\nman asked me to try. Treating it as a joke, I did so, holding the forked\ntwig as I saw it held by the water-finder. To my astonishment, at the spot\nwhere the water finder had marked, I felt what seemed like a slight electric\nshock and immediately the forked twig turned violently in my hands. I\nheld the stick as tight as I could to prevent it moving, but it twisted right\nround to the ground. I was dumbfounded and the joke was turned against\nme. A well was sunk at the spot and a good supply of running water\nobtained.\nWhen it became known that I was a \"water-witch,\" my services were\nsought for and I have since located a large number of wells, without making\nany charge. I have been surprised to find how accurate the indications of\nthe twig have turned out ; even in the depth I have rarely been far out ! 1\nMr. Dixon states he could give me many instances of his success\nwhen previous attempts to find water had failed. He quotes one case\nof his in considerable detail, which I will abridge. An acquaintance\nof his in Kansas had spent large sums in sinking several wells on his\n40 acre farm, but had got no water, though some of the wells were\n70 ft. deep. At last he begged Mr. Dixon to come over and try his\nhand. Mr. Dixon went and prospected with his peach twig ; he was\nsurprised to find the twig move strongly at one spot, indicating a\nplentiful water supply, which he estimated at only 18 ft. deep. It\nsuited the owner's purpose better to sink a well a few feet from this\nspot and at a depth of 22 ft. water was found streaming in from the\ndirection indicated by Mr. Dixon. As the well caved in shortly after,\nthe owner decided to sink a walled-in well at the very spot marked by\nthe twig, and at less than 20 ft. from the surface came upon so\nabundant a supply of water that it has served the whole farm ever\nsince. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of Mr. Dixon's state\nments, but it is desirable to have them confirmed by independent\nobservers, and therefore I should be grateful to any of our friends in\nCalifornia who may live near Escondido if they would kindly send me\nsome further particulars.\nConcerning one Californian dowser, a Captain Godfrey, I have\nreceived an enormous mass of correspondence, forwarded to me by\n1 Mr. Dixon does not say how he ascertains the depth by the motion of the twig.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 251\nDr. Hodgson and various other friends. Some of the evidence is\nremarkable, and I hope to find time to give an abridgement of it at a\nfuture time. Captain Godfrey declares he is so powerfully affected\nby the neighbourhood of underground veins of ore or running\nwater that he is made quite ill. He attributes it all to electricity (!)\nand his wife writes voluminous letters, asking for scientific enquiry.\nThis I have attempted to obtain, but Captain Godfrey declines to\nsubmit to any tests. Dr. Hodgson has taken much trouble over\nthis case, and referred me to one of the members of the S. P. R.\nin California, Mr. Radcliffe -Whitehead, who had recently visited\nCaptain Godfrey. I wrote to Mr. Whitehead, and had the following\nreply : \u2014\nP.O. Box 144, Santa Barbara, California, March 6\/A, 1898.\nI called on Captain Godfrey in Pasadena, where he lives, two months\nago. He is a fine old man, and from what I have seen and heard I should\njudge him to be above all suspicion of fraud. From the statements made\nto the Society and similar ones made to me, I have no doubt that he has\nsome curious faculty, in fact, is a sensitiee.\nThe difficulty of going further with this case lies thus. Captain Godfrey\nsays :\u2014\n1. \" I don't care a rap for the scientific aspect of my case.\"\n2. \" I suffer physically when I experience the sensations given me by\nunderground streams of water or veins of metal.\"\n3. \"I don't care to make experiments, nor will I seek for water for a\nfee. I will only do so if I am to have a share in the ' development ' (as we\ncall it here) of said water.\"\nNow I, as a developer of water on my own land,\u2014I am making two\nwater tunnels at this time,\u2014should be willing enough to employ Captain\nGodfrey to \" locate \" water for me for a fee, but I am not disposed to agree\nto his terms, though I have complete faith in his honesty.\nI will write to him shortly and try to induce him to change his mind, but\nas he has lately refused a neighbour of mine who made a similar proposal, I\nconfess I have not much hope. However nous renuns. I will report.\nRalph Raucliffe-Whitehead.\nIn a subsequent letter Mr. RadcliffeWhitehead informs me he has\nfailed to induce Godfrey to change his mind, and mentions another\nCalifornian dowser he knows, and is about to employ. Another\none of our Californian members, to whom I had written about\nCaptain Godfrey, after undertaking to do what he could, writes as\nfollows :\u2014\n2,727, Ellendale-place, Los Angelos, California, U.S.A.,\nFebruary 17th, 1898.\nMy own experiments have been with a man who is a little ashamed of his\npower, and does not attempt to explain it. He is honest beyond question,\nand has submitted to such complete tests\u2014being tested when blindfolded ;\n\f252 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nfinding buried waterpipes ; and by the actual discovery of water in places\nwhere it was least to be expected\u2014that I am reluctantly forced to believe\nthat some such power exists, especially as a complete test satisfied me that it\nwas not a case of mind-reading.\nI have no knowledge of divining for water without a rod, but one of my\nfarmers, who is an honest and clear-headed fellow, tells me that in his Iowa\nhome they found all their wells by aid of a man who almost had convulsions\nwhen passing over running water. He gives some curious cases of wells so\nfound, after attempts to get water in the same farms without his aid had\nfailed, and one case where the man had a fit at a house-warming, and\ndeclared that the trouble came from a spring under the house. On digging,\na powerful and valuable spring was discovered near the surface. If you\nvalue such evidence, I shall be glad to get the exact facts and the man's name\nf,,r you\" Walter Nordhoff.\nVarious instances of the use of the rod for finding underground\nwater in other parts of the United States and in Canada were given in\nthe previous Report on pages 27, 44, 59, C2, and 215-220.\n\u00a7 3. South African Dowsers.\nThe use of the divining rod has even extended to Bulawayo. In\nan article in that able English journal, the Surveyor, which refers to the\n\" cold scrutiny \" and \" careful dissecting \" to which the diviner has been\nsubjected in our previous Report, the following instance of the use of\nthe rod in Bulawayo is quoted from a correspondent to a South African\nnewspaper : \u2014\nHaving sunk on the spot located through the medium of the divining\nrod, I have, at a depth of 30 ft., struck the water ; whereas my neighbour,\nat considerable expense, two years ago sank, on the same line and only 30\nyards away, to a depth of 45 ft. without any result whatever. I am now\nconvinced of the great expense which the rod may save in sinking for water.\nThis must be taken for what it is worth, as no names are given. In\nSouth African journals for August, 1897, particulars are given of a\nclerical water-tinder.\n\"It will be remembered,\" says the Grahamskmni Journal \"that some\nmonths ago the Rev. Father M.irconnes, of St. Aidan's College, who is an\nadept in the use of the divining rod, made certain predictions as to the\nfinding of water in certain spots, which he pointed out. The Government\nsieam drill, under Mr. J. L. Caithness, has now found water just outside the\nChronic Sick confines at Cape Corps Camp on the Commonage. The water\nwas found at a spot pointed out by the diviner. It was first tapped at\n21 ft. by an excavation Mr. Caithness was making to get his bore loose,\nand at 37 ft. a supply of quite 6,000 gallons per diem was tapped. The\nwater is good and fresh. Again, at the St. Andrew's College, where Father\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Hod. 253\nMarconnes pointed out a spot, ami said there was water at 40 ft., the precious\nfluid has been tapped exactly at 40 ft., and in good quantity.\"\nFather Marconnes writes in a subsequent number of the Grahams-\ntown Journal that ho prefers to call his divining rod a water compass,\nor hydro-magnet, as it is a \" scientific instrument,\" and clearly indicates\nthat electricity is the true cause of its action ; he does not, however,\ngive any evidence in support of his belief. I do not quote this case as\nof any evidential value, for I have not been able to verify it, and more\nover there is nothing to indicate that water would not have been found\nwithout Father Marconnes' aid, but I give it simply to indicate the\nwidespread use of the rod.\nAs is well known, the divining rod was frequently used during the\n17th century for tracking suspected persons, and for other purposes in\nthe \"moral world.\" Among the native races in South Africa the rod\nappears to be still in use for a like purpose. Though outside the range\nof the present Report, the following incident in connection with the\nsiege of Mafeking has attracted so much attention that I will briefly\nrefer to it here. A Press Association telegram appeared in the English\nnewspapers of April 18th, 1900, to this effect:\u2014\nApril bth.\nLieut. Frank Smitheman, the renowned Matabele scout, got through the\nBoer lines, and arrived here yesterday, carrying an Imperial Government\ndespatch for Col. Baden-Powell. He had an adventurous journey, spending\ntwo nights in coming from Ramathlahama on foot.\nLieut. Smitheman, who knows every inch of the country, was accom\npanied by a clever native runner, who uses a divining rod to ascertain the\nposition of the enemy. This rod he handles after the fashion of the Wilt\nshire water-finder, thoroughly believing in its efficiency.\nLieut. Smitheman's feat is one of the utmost importance. Only two\nwhites have entered the town since the beginning of the investment.\nTwo centuries ago (in 1692) the famous dowser, Jacques Aymar,\nbecame notorious by his discovery (through following the indications\nof the rod) of the murderer of a poor wine-seller in Lyons, and in 1703\nhe was employed to identify the Camisards by the same means. Since\nthen (owing chiefly to the rod being condemned for any use in the\n\" moral world,\" see p. 258) its employment for criminal purposes has\ndisappeared in Europe. Inquiry may prove that the South African\nreport is not to be credited, or the \"diviner\" worthless, but the case\nof Jacques Aymar is as well attested as any fact in history.1 I have\nin my possession a mass of original documents, published at the time,\nwhich place the really extraordinary character of Aymar's discovery of\n1 The best modern account of this story is given in Figuier's Histuire du Mtr-\nreillcux, Vol. II., Chap. 5.\n\f254 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nthe murderer of the Lyons wine-seller beyond doubt. Nor is there\nany improbability in the circumstance, if we here regard the dowser as\na bloodhound following a trail, which his sub-conscious self picks up\nand indicates through the involuntary motion of the rod he carries.\n\u00a7 4. Australian Dowsers.\nIn the previous Report (Vol. XIII., pp. 45-47) I gave an account\nof four successful amateur dowsers in Queensland and New South\nWales. Several other cases of Australian dowsers have since reached\nme. Two cases are of such interest that I will briefly refer to them,\nas in both these cases the dowsers were gentlemen of good standing\nand intelligence.\n(1) The following account has been sent me by Mr. Vaughan\nJenkins ; it was published in the Sydney Stock Journal and in the\nAnnidate Chronicle (a New South Wales paper) for April 14th, 1900.\nThe report is too long to quote, and I give a summary of its essential\nparts.\nThe President of the Armidale Cattle Show, Mr. F. J. White (a well-\nknown man), was greatly in need of a water supply on his estate, Saumarez.\nFor twenty-four years that his family have lived there they have had to cart\nwater from a distance, as did their predecessor, Mr. Thomas, attempts to\nfind water on the place having failed. Eventually Mr. White sunk a deep\nwell, 120 ft. deep, through the solid rock, but no water was reached. A\nfriend who was visiting the place happened to he an amateur dowser, and,\nseeing the useless well, offered to try his luck with the divining rod. He\ndid so, and the rod turned vigorously at a certain spot. Here another well\nwas sunk, and at 35 ft. water was struck, it rose to 20 ft. from the surface,\nand now supplies the place and the gardens. Mr. White then tried the rod\nhimself and found to his surprise it turned in his hands : trusting solely to\nits guidance, he has since sunk six more wells, and found water in every spot\nso indicated. He is now so firmly convinced of the value of the rod that\nhe has recently offered to pay the cost of digging any well if its indications\nturn out wrong. The writer of the article went as a sceptic to investigate\nand report, but his amused incredulity became astonishment when he found\nthe twig turned in his hands also. He remarks : \" I don't believe in that\ntwig business, but the facts are against me. Will somebody explain ? \"\nThe foregoing newspaper report must be taken for what it is worth,\nas I have not had time to verify it by independent inquiries.\n(2) The other case I have received through the kindness of a\nWest Australian friend, Mr. E. T. Scammell, 37, St. Mary Axe,\nLondon, E.C. The dowser in this case was his friend, the late Mr.\nE. H. Deuington, for many years an Australian journalist of high\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 255\nstanding and unimpeachable integrity. At my request Mr. Scammell\nobtained a lengthy narrative, accompanied by the corroborative\ntestimony of independent witnesses, from Mr. Derrington. This\naccount is of interest from the fact that Mr. Derrington became a\nvery successful dowser for mineral lodes, particulars of which will be\ngiven in that part of our work. Mr. Derrington writes :\u2014\nCoolgardie, W. Australia, May 24lh, 1898.\nNewspaper editorship during many years predisposed me to regard with\nstrong scepticism all fads and faddists. I, with courtesy, declined even to\nwitness experiments with the so-called \"divining rod\"\u2014a name as absurd\nand untrue as any I have ever heard, since there is no divination in the\nwhole process. Ignorance and credulity may still employ it, but no\neducated man would employ it. But, some fourteen years ago, there\noccurred in the colony I have made my home for now nearly half a century,\none of the periodical droughts for which unfortunately South Australia has\nbecome noted. The misery and ruin in the out-lying agricultural districts\nwere forced upon my attention, and then the pretensions of the water-\nfinders came to my mind, and I resolved upon an impartial investigation,\nremembering what a priceless boon would be conferred if hidden supplies\nof water could be discovered in the waterless districts. I applied to an\nold German of most respectable antecedents and strong common-sense, who\nwas renowned as a successful exponent of the art. Without giving me any\nillustration, he at once placed in my hand a V-shaped eucalyptus twig, and\nwhilst he remained at the entrance-gate, requested me to cross from one\nside to the other through his garden. I did so, and midway was astonished\nby the twig (held by the points in the forks of the thumbs, the fingers\nbeing closed over it in the palms of the hands) suddenly up-rising and\nstanding perpendicularly, entirely without my volition, and falling back into\nits horizontal position when I had passed one particular spot. I repeated\nthe experiment a number of times with the same result, only that I noticed\na singular sensation as of an electric current through the spine whenever\nthe twig moved as described. My friend watching then showed me that I\nhad stood over a concealed water-channel fed by a spring from the upper part\nof his garden, and complimented me upon being the most sensitive water-\nfinder he had ever met. This was my first acquaintance with this unknown\nfaculty. I laid aside scepticism and eagerly made use of this method to\nassist the distressed farmers with whom I came into contact.\nI have since made very numerous experiments, with a view to an\naccurate estimate of the cause and effect ; and I have submitted to a variety\nof crude tests, many of which were designed less for the discovery of\na scientific basis than to throw ridicule upon an obscure phenomenon.\nPseudo-scientists are prone to sneer at what they cannot understand, but\nI hold there is in ascertained results sufficient ground to justify the hope\nthat, at some not far distant future, a possibility of effecting economic results\nof incalculable value in the discovery both of underground water and ore\nby means of the so-called divining rod.\nAs to the nature of the influence which moves the rod, I am inclined to\nbelieve that in certain sensitives there may possibly be set up a current or\n\f256 Profevsor W. F. Barrett. [part\ninfluence by the electrical currents in the underground water or metallic\nveins. For I discovered subsequently my \"galvanometer,\" the rod, moved\nwhenever I was over metallic veins or even metals on the surface of the\n8round- E. H. Derrington.\nIn the foregoing narrative no evidence is detailed to show that Mr.\nDerrington's predictions were verified by digging or boring, nor that he\nsucceeded when other means had failed ; he adduces, however, some\nstriking evidence of his success in the discovery of mineral lodes, but\nthis part of his letter I will give in another place His electrical\ntheory sounds a plausible one; it is much the same as Dr. Thouvenel's\na century ago, but is unsupported by any scientific evidence and will\nbe referred to later on. I may add that in the recent obituary\nnotices of Mr. Derrington in the South Australian newspapers, a\nhigh tribute is paid to him ; he was not a man likely to be led\nastray by hasty inferences as to the value of the indications afforded\nby the divining rod.\nI now propose to give a somewhat detailed account of that\nremarkable French peasant lad, Bleton, whose performances as a\nwater-finder Dr. Thouvenel has made famous.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 257\nPART X.\nBleton, the Notable French Dowser of the Last Century.\nBarthelmy Bleton, to whom reference has already been made (on\np. 20 e.t seq. of the previous Report) was born at Bouvantes in\nDauphiny, somewhere between the years 1740 and 1750.1 He was\nthe son of a poor peasant, was brought up by charity in one of the\nCarthusian monasteries of Dauphiny, and became a herdsman. An\naccidental circumstance seems to have led to the discovery of Bleton's\npeculiar faculty. Here is the account which I find given by one of Dr.\nThouvenel's correspondents, who writes from Dijon on April 14th,\n1781, and who adds he has certain proofs of all that he has stated.2\nThe following extract is translated from the original letter : \u2014,\nBleton, when seven years of age, had carried dinner to some workmen ;\nhe sat down on a stone, when a fever or faintness seized him ; the workmen\nhaving brought him to their side, the faintness ceased, but each time he\nreturned to the stone, he suffered again. This was told to the Prior of the\nChartreuse, who wished to see it for himself Being thus convinced of the\nfact, he had the ground under the stone dug up ; there they found a spring,\nwhich, I am told, is still in use to turn a mill.\nA similar account is given by another contemporary quoted by\nFiguier, and by the writer in the Monthly Review for 1782, who\nquotes from a French pamphlet, the writer of which states the\ncircumstance is \" confirmed by many local witnesses.\" Some confirma\ntion of the foregoing story is gained from a remark made by the Prior\n\"de la Chartreuse de Lyon\" in a document testifying to Bleton's\nextraordinary faculty (quoted by Thouvenel) that Bleton \" was quite\nas well able to detect underground water when he was seven years old\nas he is now.\" (March 3rd, 1781.)\nIn any other part of the world except Dauphiny the coincidence\nof the boy's illness and the presence of an underground spring would\n1 The exact date of hia birth is uncertain, nor is it of any consequence. The above\ndate is deduced from an incidental observation in the evidence about to be cited. In\n1773, as appears from another witness, Bleton's faculty was so well known that he\nwas then in request as a water-finder or sourcicr. Our principal knowledge of Bleton,\nas will be mentioned presently, is derived from the writings of Dr. Thouvenel, one of\nLouis XVI. 's physicians ; he always spells the word Bleton, not Bleton.\n* See Dr. Thouvenel's Mimoirc Physique et Midicinal, 1781, p. 251 ; Monthly\nReview, 1782, Vol. LXVIL, p. 554 ; Figuier's La baguette divinatoire, p. 365. Figuier\nquotes from a letter written by a contemporary of Bleton to the Editor of the\nJournal des Spectacle!.\ni\"\n\f258 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nprobably soon have been forgotten. But, a century before, Jacques\nAymar and his rod had made this province famous for its diviners,\nAymar having been followed by many who claimed a similar '' gift.\"\nAs, however, the Inquisition had forbidden the use of the rod in the\n\"moral world,\" that is, for tracing criminals, or determining boun\ndaries, or settling lawsuits, etc. (its use for these purposes having\nbecome a most mischievous superstition and scandal), these diviners,\nor tourneurx, were chiefly water-finders, or soureters. Bleton was\ntherefore at once considered to be a new and sensitive sourcier. Some\ntests followed which confirmed this view. Doubtless, custom\ndemanded that he should have a rod, and the subsequent use by\nBleton of a nearly straight rod, resting on the forefingers of each\nhand, satisfied the sense of sourcier propriety. The rod was very\nslightly curved, and rotated more or less rapidly on its axis when\nBleton came over an underground spring. Dr. Thouvenel states he\ncounted from 30 to 80 revolutions per minute, and upwards.\nThe rotation of the rod was doubtless caused by involuntary\nmuscular action on Bleton's part. There is no reason to suppose he\nmoved it intentionally ; in fact, it is a very difficult, if not impossible,\nfeat to accomplish by volition, except to one long practised in sleight\nof hand, as any one can prove who supports a short slightly-curved\nstick on his forefingers, and attempts to cause it to rotate from \" 30 to\n80 times a minute.\" On the other hand, there is no reason to assume\nany other motive power than muscular action, as the famous\nastronomer Lalande showed that Bleton's rod could be made to rotate\nby this means. To this I have already referred in my previous paper,\nand will quote Lalande's own words later on, on p. 273.\nHow Bleton came by this novel form of rod is not told us.1\nPossibly it was a survival in Dauphiny of an old type of the virgula\ndivina. A straight rod, supported horizontally between the forefinger\nand thumb of each hand, is described and depicted on the title page\nof that interesting old book on the divining rod, La Verge de Jacob2\n1 The only notice I can find of the peculiarity of Bleton's rod is in a letter \"from\na distinguished physician \" cited by Thouvenel in support of Bleton's faculty. The\nwriter says (p. 277 of Thouvenel's Memoirc) that although nearly all the tourncitrs,\ni.e., dowsers, he has known, use a forked rod, yet some in Germany use a simple rod,\nvery slightly curved, placed across the back of the hand, \" ou comme Bleton, sur\nl'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 des deux doigts indicateurs. \" This reference to Germany is probably\ntaken from De Vallemont's Phyiiqve Occidte (1693) where there is a picture of a man\nholding the rod in this way (see next woodcut). Still earlier, in 1640, the learned\nGerman Jesuit, A. Kircher, describes a straight-pivoted divining rod which rotates\nwhen held horizontally between the forefingers of each hand (see upper figure on the\nwood-cut, Fig. 17). This, he remarks, he has seen used by some German diviners :\nsee Kircher's Magna sire de arte Maynetica, p. 724 of the 1640 edition.\n\u25a0 It need hardly be said that this, like every other early work on the divining\nrod, is perfectly worthless from the point of view of modern science.\n\fXXXVIU.] 259\nOn the So-called Divininy Hod,\n(see D on the woodcut, Fig. 1 6), which was published at Lyons in\n1693. In the third chapter of this book the writer says that in\norder to ascertain if a person really has the faculty of finding a\nhidden spring, he must let a straight stick rest across his hands, in\nthe manner shown in the lowest figure of the woodcuts on this and the\nnext page ; if he has the faculty the stick begins to rotate.1 Bleton\nwas probably tested in this way, and subsequently used this rotating\nrod as the outward and visible sign of the inward commotion he\nFio. 16.\nexperienced. This is the more probable as the little book, La Verge\nde Jacob, was likely to be well known in Dauphiny, being published\nat the neighlxiuring town of Lyons, where also Bleton was frequently\nengaged.

A sort of convulsive spasm seized him, affecting the diaphragm\nand pulse. Abundant evidence of the genuineness of this \"com\nmotion \" is given by a number of unimpeachable witnesses. But this\naspect of our subject I will return to in a later section, when the\nmedical report Dr. Thouvenel gives of the peculiar symptoms exhibited\nby his \" patient \" will be quoted. Here I will only add thatJBleton's\nsensibility appeared to vary, being greater in dry weather and before\nmeals. It entirely ceased during an illness he had, and did not return\nFio. 17.\nuntil three months subsequent to his recovery. The rate of rotation of\nthe baguette was observed closely to correspond with the physiological\neffect produced. When Bleton moved away from an underground\nspring, the symptoms disappeared as rapidly as they arose, and the\npulse resumed its normal rate. Stagnant water appeared to make\nno impression on him, nor the water of exposed rivers, lakes, <fee.\nThis latter is indeed a singular, and at first sight appears a suspicious\ncircumstance, difficult to reconcile with any physical theory of the\nphenomena. But equally singular is the fact that it is affirmed by all\ndiviners from the time of Jacques Aymar in 1693 down to the present\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 261\nday,1 and not in one country but wherever the divining rod is in\nuse, not the least singular fact how this tradition (if it be only\nsuch) has spread, for diviners, as a rule, are illiterate men, ignorant\nof any language but their own. Let us now examine what experi\nmental evidence history has preserved on behalf of Bleton's alleged\npowers.\nThe principal source of information is found in two treatises\nentitled Memoire Physique et Medicinal, by Dr. Thouvenel, who was a\ndistinguished French physician.- The first treatise was published in\n1781 and the second in 1784, and both are almost entirely devoted to\na record of observations with Bleton and an exposition of Thouvenel's\nelectrical theory of the phenomena.3 The best English summary of\nthese memoires is to be found in that old but well edited register of\ncurrent literature, the Monthly Reciew for 1781, 1783, and 1784.\nThere are, unfortunately, few details given by Thouvenel of his\nown experiments with l-tleton.\nNo. 1.\u2014Here, however, is one, which he says is a complicated test\nto which he submitted Bleton. I will give an abridged translation\n(pp. 69 and 70).\nOver a stone bridge, of one arch, pass four small wooden aqueducts,\ncarrying water to Nancy. Only the engineer, who had never seen Bleton,\nknew the exact position of these four rows of pipes, their distance apart,\ndepth underground, etc., the whole being well covered by earth and vegeta\ntion. He gave me secretly information on this, of which Bleton was entirely\nignorant. The latter was then taken across this bridge, as though to return\nto the town, after various experiments had been made in the neighborhood,\nand without being told that fresh experiments were to be made. Just\nbefore reaching the bridge, he asserted water was flowing beneath him, and\nthe sensation continued with slight gaps, while crossing and in front of the\nbridge to a distance of five or six feet. He retraced his steps several times\nbefore finding distinctly the four channels, and was much astonished to\n1 In 1689 an interesting correspondence (to which I will return) took place\nbetween those acute intellects, Fathers Malebranche and Le Brun, on this very point.\nFor a discussion of the sensations alleged to be experienced by dowsers, see\nProceedings S.P.R.. Part XXXII., Appendix D., p. 272.\na The great French Biographical Dictionary gives an admirable account of\nThouvenel's life, which deserves to be more widely known. Like Dr. Elliotson, in\ndefence of mesmerism, Dr. Thouvenel had to face a storm of obloquy for his courage\nin defending Bleton. His long and patient investigations were treated with contempt.\nHe left France for Italy at the time of the Revolution, and died in 1815.\n3 I have to thank II. Holland, of 2, Rue des Chantiers, Paris, for enabling me to\nobtain a copy of Thouvenel's earlier and more important Memoire, together with\nother rare French, German and Italian books, pamphlets, and newspaper cuttings\nof the last century bearing upon the baguette divinatoire. To those engaged in\nany special literary research I can heartily commend M. Holland's courteous help\nand excellent agency.\n\f262 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nfind them so near. He was then told that they were simply four hollow tree\ntrunks made to .serve as aqueducts.\nThouvenel then describes other tests as to the distance apart of\nthese pipes, and remarks that as a small stream about 3 feet wide was\nflowing some 10 feet beneath the bridge, he endeavoured to ascertain\nwhat effect it had on Bleton ; a careful experiment showed that the\nagitation of the diviner and the rotation of the baguette sensibly\nincreased on crossing the stream. There is nothing, however, in these\nexperiments to exclude the effect of telepathy or even involuntary\nsuggestion upon Bleton's mind. It is, however, only within recent\nyears that the powerful influence of suggestion, both on mind and\nbody, has received the attention of physiologists, and therefore we\nneed not te surprised that some of Thouvenel's experiments are\ncapable of a different interpretation from that which he gave. For\nexample, he found that when his sourcier was over a spring and the\nbaguette turning strongly, the convulsive movements of the body and\nthe rotation of the rod were almost arrested the moment he touched\nBleton with various \" magnetic compositions recently electrified \" !\nExperiments were also made when Bleton was insulated, but these\nI will deal with in another part, as the belief that insulation stops\nthe movement of the rod is almost as widespread as that of the\ndifferent effects of running and stagnant water.\nOn pp. 77-80 of his first memoire Thouvenel gives a summary of\nthe tests he made with Bleton in Lorraine. The following is a\ntranslation of the passage ' : \u2014\nI took the precaution to repeat several times all the experiments just\ndescribed in detail, after having carefully blindfolded Bleton ; in addition\nhis arms were sometimes fastened behind his back leaving his forearms only\njust sufficiently free to hold the baguette at the extremity of his fingers,\nsometimes even confining these, in order to hinder if possible all mechanical\nmovement. These precautions were not taken for my own satisfaction, as I\nwas already entirely convinced.\nI conducted Bleton to places which he had never seen ; I took him\ntowards springs of which I knew, but which he could not know of, at other\ntimes over ground where neither of us knew what might bu found. When\never he experienced his peculiar sensations\u2014and whenever the baguette\nrepeatedly turned at the same spot, \u2014I then led him far away, bringing him\nback by quite different roads, still with his eyes bandaged. . . . When\nhe had followed the course of an underground spring\u2014sometimes for more\nthan a quarter of a mile, across mountains, rock, or forests, and indicated\non the way numerous subdivisions of the same spring\u2014 I made him return.\nHe then re-conducted me himself, though still blindfolded, only supported by\none arm, to the point from which we set out, without straying a single step\n1 Already quoted in Part V. on \" Blindfolding the Dowser.\"\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 263\nfrom the line previously traced and marked by pegs, which were often hidden\nbeneath the surface. He re-found all the subterranean rivulets already\npointed out, and followed exactly the sinuosities of the underground stream.\nIt frequently happened that we came across springs whose course was\ninterrupted by walls, terraces, or wide ditches, so that in order to enable\nBleton to overcover these obstacles, I had to procure ladders, or take long\ndetours, or in some way get him conveyed across ; nevertheless, although\nblindfolded, he soon regained the course without the aid of his eyes.\nSometimes in order to try and deceive him, if his senses were concerned,\nI placed false marks as if to indicate a spring; sometimes after he had\nfollowed a spring across several fields, I moved the pegs some feet away\nwithout his knowledge. Nevertheless, he was never led astray and always\nrectified such errors. In fine, I tried all sorts of ways to deceive him, and I\ncan testify that in more than six hundred trials, I did not succeed in doing\nso one single time.\nM. Jadelot, the Professor of Medicine in Nancy, Thouvenel states,\nwas a witness of, and co-operated in, all his experiments, which\nextended over a space of two months, and was no less struck than he\nwas with the strength and importance of the evidence obtained.\nAnother distinguished savant who was converted to a belief in the\nbaguette was M. Sigaud de la Fond, whose published testimony\nThouvenel quotes (p. 289 et seq.). But the most important evidence\non behalf of Bleton is contained in the numerous letters and affidavits\nThouvenel appends to his work. These are the replies he received\nfrom various well-known persons who had employed Bleton, and\nwhose opinion he had asked. I will quote some of these directly.\nIn addition to the foregoing, Bleton found one or more valuable\nsprings (as testified by letters or proces-verbaux) for the Marquis de\nTorcy in Poiton, for the President of Lamoignon in Basville, for the\nBishop of Laon in Annisy, for the Count dAdhemar in Thun, for the\nDuke d'IJzes, Count de la Blanche, Count du Bourg, President\nd'Ornacieux, M. de la Borde, and many other French personages of\ndistinction. There are also brief statements from 20 other persons\nfor whom Bleton found plusieurs belles sources, in addition to the 17\nletters or affidavits quoted at length by Thouvenel. In these pieces\njustificatives Thouvenel as a rule gives only the initials of his corre\nspondents ; the documents, he tells us, are all signed and some legally\nattested, but some of the writers might object to their names being\npublished ; moreover, he adds that in physics names add nothing to\nthe facts themselves.1\nNo. 2.\u2014In one statement, however, this rule is departed from,\nand Thouvenel humorously prefixes the heading : \" Proces verbal\n1 This may account for the omission of his own name (initials only being given)\nas the author of these Memoires.\n\f26-1 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nsur Bleton . . . papier timbre\", paraphe\", collationne, etc., etc. (Bon\npour ceux qui aiment ces petites formalites),\" and the testimony is\ncertified by, and attested before, a list of signatories whose names\nand official titles are appended. In this case the evidence of the\nvarious municipal officers of the Commune of St. Jean-en-Royant in\nDauphiny is given. Bleton was a native of, and resided in, this\ncommune (Bouvantes being a parish therein), and the proces-verbal\nstates that Bleton had possessed the gift of finding springs for about\n30 years, and had practised it much to the advantage of the inhabitants\nof the commune. Specific instances are then cited of the more\nimportant springs Bleton had found in arid ground\u2014springs which\nwere still running, the witnesses affirm, and had largely increased the\nvalue of the property in the commune: owing to these discoveries, fertile\nand productive land had, in several places, now replaced the previously\nbarren soil. The Chief Clerk of the neighbouring commune states that\nBleton found for him an ample spring in a district where no water was\npreviously known to exist, the result of which was that the ground,\nwhich formerly was of little or no value, now is a valuable property.\nThe signatories of the proces-verbal further testify that Bleton had\ndiscovered during the preceding 20 years a quantity of springs in\nother neighbouring communes, some of these being of so great a\nvolume that machinery was worked by them.\nNo. 3.\u2014Another document also signed by M. A., an inhabitant\nof St. Jean de Royant, states that the value of his property had\nbeen increased tenfold by the springs discovered on it by Bleton.\nNo. i.\u2014The Prior of the Chartreuse de Lyon testifies (March 3rd,\n1781) that Bleton had found several springs for him and had not once\nbeen mistaken, though his estimate of the depth and volume of the\nwater he acknowledged to be conjectural. Bleton's discovery of his\nliability to err on this point being, he adds, the only progress he had\nmade since he was seven years old, when \" il etoit aussi savant qu'il\nTest actuellement.\" The Prior states that when he held Bleton's\nwrist, the change in Bleton's pulse was so perceptible upon arriving\nover an underground spring that the fact was as obvious to him as to\nthe sourcier, a baguette being perfectly needless.\nNo. 5.\u2014 The CJtevalier de M , formerly Captain of the Pied\nmont regiment, testifies that he has been convinced of Bleton's powers\nin spite of the prejudices he previously entertained. Having put\nBleton to all the proofs he could think of, he never once found him\nmistaken. \" Whatever the power is,\" he remarks, \" it is not the mere\nmovement of the baguette that astonishes me\u2014that might be a matter\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 265\nof skill\u2014but the effect on Bleton's pulse and nervous system were\nunmistakeable, and these cannot be simulated. Moreover,\" he con\ntinues, \" j'ai fait toutes les chicanes que mes doutes m'ont inspirees,\"\nuntil doubt became impossible. The Chevalier describes in detail one\nof several tests he made ; he brought Bleton to his own house, arriving\nafter dark ; in passing through the village, which Bleton had not visited\nbefore, Bleton suddenly stopped and said water was there ; he followed\nit in the darkness and arrived at a spot where he declared the spring\nexisted ; he was right ; it was, in fact the source of the fountain of\nthe castle. Other tests are also given : altogether a remarkable and\nweighty testimony.\nNo. 6.\u2014M. de F., the receiver of taxes for Autun, states that a\nstrong spring was discovered on his place by Bleton. In order to\ntest the sourcier, M. de F. afterwards blindfolded him, and took him\nover the same ground ; Bleton marked precisely the same spots he\ndid previously when not blindfolded ; this experiment he repeated\nseveral times.\nNo. 7.\u2014Dr. de C. (a neighbour of M. de F.) took Bleton to his\nhouse, where Bleton accurately traced the course of the water pipes, a\nfact confirmed by the workmen who had laid them.\nNo. 8.\u2014M. le Comte de M., of Chagny, describes several careful\ntests he made of Bleton. In one, after Bleton had accurately indicated\nan underground spring (the existence of which was known to the\nCount, but unknown to Bleton) and traced its direction, which was\nnoted, the Count then carefully bandaged Bleton's eyes with a thick\nhandkerchief, and, in order to mislead him, turned him round several\ntimes ; nevertheless Bleton correctly indicated the same course of the\nspring, in spite of frequent attempts made to divert him. Holding his\nwrist, the Count noticed that the change in the rate of Bleton's pulse\nwas very marked when he came over the spring.\nNo. 9.\u2014The Bishop of M. describes how his Archbishop tested\nBleton's ability to discover running water : (1) Bleton correctly traced\nthe buried water pipes in the Archbishop's grounds when water was\nflowing through them ; (2) Unknown to Bleton the water was then\nturned off and he was asked to repeat the trial, and he completely failed\nto find the pipes ; (3) Again the water was secretly turned on, and\nBleton once more correctly indicated the direction taken by the pipes.\nNo. 10.\u2014The Chevalier de S., commandeur de Malte, states that\nmany years previously his grandfather had made several attempts\nto find water at his Chdteau pres de la Cdte de Saint-Andre, had\n\f266 Professcn- W. F. Barrett. [pakt\neven sunk a well to the depth of seventy feet, which had to he\nabandoned. The Chevalier de S., and his brother, the President d'O.,\nin 1735 sent for a sourcier they knew of who traversed the estate,\nusing an iron rod they had picked up as a baguette. Upon their\nexpressing surprise at his ability to use so novel a divining rod, the\nsourcier replied, \" the rod is of no consequence, it is the peculiar\nfeeling I have when over an underground spring that guides me.\"\nIn 1773 (thirty-eight years later) the Chevalier heard of Bleton and\nsent for him. On his arrival he was taken to the terrace, where the\nrod began to rotate, and the site of the well was correctly indicated.\nTo estimate its depth Bleton went to, a certain distance on each side,\nthe rod rotating in an opposite direction as he moved away from the\nspring. By observing the distance and decreasing force of the rotation,\nBleton estimated the depth of the well to be 64 feet : its actual depth\nwas 66 feet.\nBleton was then taken to a hill behind the chateau, when he\npointed out the existence of several springs in the spots marked ; the\nfollowing winter a well was sunk at one of these spots and water\nfound at a depth of 18 feet, a narrow layer of sand being struck after\npiercing through the upper very hard rock. This spring has never run\ndry, even in times of great drought. Two years later (in 1775) Bleton\nwas again tested on the same estate and he indicated another spring,\nthe depth of which he estimated at 33 feet ; a well was sunk at this\nspot and the prediction was verified. Some time after, the two springs\nwere joined by underground conduits ; these conduits Bleton accurately\ntraced when he was again summoned to the chateau in 1779.\nIn 1781 a fourth visit to this estate was made by Bleton. This\ntime he discovered another spring, which he estimated at 25 feet deep;\na well was sunk and at 35 feet an abundant supply of water was\nobtained ; this also issued from a layer of sand beneath the hard\nsuperincumbent rock.\nSome experiments were then made by the President d'O. and his\nbrother as to the movement of the baguette when Bleton was placed in\nvarious positions. The rod turned when he lay on his back, but not\non his stomach, nor did it turn when it was placed on his loins when he\nwas lying down. Bleton was then suspended upside down and the\nbaguette placed on the soles of his feet ; it did not rotate. Bleton,\nhowever, showed them that when the rod was placed nearly perpen\ndicularly with one end resting on the palm of the left hand, and the\nother in the air, encircled by a ring formed of the finger and thumb of\nthe right hand placed a little below the point, the baguette \" pirouetted\nslowly,\" when over a spring.\nThis interesting document ends by suggesting the desirability of\nplacing le tourriKur de baguette on a sheet of resin or a glass-legged\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 267\nstool and noticing whether his peculiar sensations are still experienced,\nor whether they resemble the sensations one has when thus insulated\nand connected with an electric machine. If, remarks the Chevalier,\nrunning water gives off subtle emanations, they must be comparable\nto those of light, and possibly suffer refraction and reflection in their\ncourse. The document is signed by the President d'O., who states\nthat he did not write it, but he approves ; and that the facts narrated\nwere all witnessed by him, his son, the Chevalier de S., and other\npersons, and he adds his conviction that Bleton employed no\ncharlatanerie in any of his proceedings.\nNo. 11.\u2014On the lands of the Abbe de Vervains there were certain\nsprings, all trace of which had long been lost ; they were, however,\nknown to exist from the ancient title-deeds of the estate. A lawsuit\nhinged upon the question of their existence being actually proved.\nWhen search for the springs had been made in vain, Bleton was sent\nfor. He came and indicated the place where these springs existed.\nTheir actual existence was then discovered, and the lawsuit\nterminated.1\nNo. 12.\u2014Surgeon-Major N., of St. Geny Laval, near Lyons, testifies\nthat Bleton came to a part of his estate which was rocky and arid,\nand found one spot where the baguette indicated a considerable\nspring, which he estimated to be at a depth of some 55 feet. A well\nwas sunk, but no water found at this depth. Bleton was, therefore,\nsent for again. He tested the ground once more, asserted confidently\nthat a good spring would be found at a few feet lower, remarking that he\nwas often mistaken as to the depth when it was over 30 feet.2 The\nwell was, therefore, deepened, and at 7 or 8 feet lower so powerful a\nspring gushed forth that it was impossible to sink deeper, as the water\nrapidly rose in the well, which was 5 feet in diameter. The witness\nadds, \"A useless land has thus been converted into a meadow.\"\nNo. 13. \u2014P. I. G., and Seigneur D., Conseiller du Parlement de B.,\naffirm that they brought Bleton to Tanyot, in Bourgogne, where he was\nsubjected to various tests, three of which are cited : (1) He was asked\nto find the course of some water pipes that had been laid some time\npreviously and which were completely covered by earth and grass,\nso that no difference was apparent on the surface of the ground.\nBleton immediately discovered the position of, and accurately traced,\n1 Quoted from the Monthly Review for 1784, p. 572.\na There is evidently a misprint in the French text here, which reads \"au-dessous\nde trente pieds \" ; from the context obviously au-deesus is meant.\n\f268 Professor W. F. Barrett. [paht\nthe course of these pipes. (2) He was asked to find the spring which\nsupplied a neighbouring well, and to estimate its depth. This he did\nquite accurately, and stated it was a very feeble spring, which the\nowner of the well certified was also correct. (3) He was asked to\nfind a supply of water for their chateau. For some time he searched in\nvain, but eventually in another direction he found six small springs:\ntheir position was marked by pegs. Upon digging at these spots,\nsprings were found in each place at about the depth and volume\nhe indicated. These springs were then connected by a deep trench,\nand furnished an abundant supply of water for both house and\ngarden.\nIt is needless to translate and summarise the other documents,\nwhich contain similar evidence. Thouvenel's treatise, however, is not\nthe only source of our information about Bleton. Accounts of this\nsourcier are to be found in many of the French journals of that period.\nI am indebted for much of the subsequent evidence to the excellent\nand impartial narrative of Bleton given by Louis Figuier in the\nseventh chapter of the second volume of his Histoire du Merveilleux,\nwhich contains some facts I have not met with elsewhere.\nNo. 14.\u2014 In the Journal de Paris of May 13th, 1782, an account\nwas published of some careful experiments made to test Bleton's\npowers in the gardens of the Luxembourg under the direction of\nM. Guillaumot \" intendant general des batiments du roi,\" who was\naccompanied by inspectors and officials of the gardens. The report\nstates :\u2014\nSorti du Chateau d'Eau, Bleton a suivi dans la campagne l'aqueduc\nd'Arcueil avec une precision telle que, pour nous servir d'une de M.\nGuillaumot, si ce plan venait a se perdre, on le referait sur les traces\nde Bleton.\nThe report states that M. Guillaumot verified from the plans the\nangles and sinuosities made by the (I presume subterranean) aqueduct,\nand these the report adds : \" nous dirons presque math&natiques\ndesignes par Bleton.\" Two days later the experiments were repeated\nin the presence of the municipal authorities and a crowd of spectators.\nThe report states :\u2014\nIci les exp\u00e9riences ont 6te telles qu'a l'exception de deux seuls temoins,\nqui avaient publiquement avancu qn'ils ne croiraient pas, meme en voyant,\nqu' a cette exception pres, sur cinq cents spectateurs, il n'en est pas\nun qui n'ait 6te convaincu de la faculte' dont est dou\u00a3 Bleton de suivre\nles eaux souterraines avec la plus rigoureuse precision.

The jets of this fountain had been removed, so that the\nwater ran into the basin, and off through an overflow pipe, quite\nnoiselessly. Here Bleton indicated running water at certain spots\nwhich were marked; he was then made to retrace his steps 10 or 12\ntimes, and it was found that the baguette turned nearly, but not quite,\ninvariably when he crossed the same spots : at the places where the\nwater entered the basin and where the overflow pipe discharged he\nwas always right. This they verified at least a dozen times. The\nexperiments lasted two hours, with a short interval for rest ; during\nthe whole time Bleton was blindfolded, and during part of that time\nM. Thouvenel was not present.\nAccording to the writer of the article in the Monthly Review for\n1782 :\u2014\nThese successes led the Queen of France to employ Bleton, and the\nsprings that have been found in consequence of his indications have\nfertilised and embellished several arid districts, among which Trianon is a\nstriking example, as that delightful seat has acquired new charms by\nBleton's discoveries.1\nThe Editor of the Journal des Spectacles, in a figure of speech, we\nmust assume, states that Bleton, by his discovery of numerous springs,\nhad changed Dauphiny from an arid soil, which produced nothing, to\none of the richest in France. Dr. Ginetz, writing in the Journal de\nParis for November, 1807, states that, \"The efficacy of the baguette is\nnowhere contested in Dauphiny. I have myself,\" he says, \" frequently\n1 According to Fijjuier, however, Bleton had some failures at Trianon, mistaking\naverns and dry conduits for underground water.\n\f270 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nobserved the effects of the baguette, and can state from personal\nexperience its success in seeking for springs and metallic veins.\" 1\nIn Thouvenel's second Mhnoire, published in 1784, a further\naccount is given of his experiments with Bleton. This eminent physi\ncian was commissioned in 1 783 by Louis XVI. to examine and report\non the mineral and medicinal waters of France, and to aid him in\nthe discovery of any fresh mineral springs, he obtained permission\nto engage the services of Bleton.2 Most of this second Memoire is\ntherefore occupied with tracing hot springs and mineral waters, with\nconjectures as to the source of the former, and attempts to verify the\nelectrical hypothesis which Thouvenel had formed, of the influence of\nsubterranean springs on the diviner.\nWe need not concern ourselves with the latter, as the experiments\ncited are certainly open to criticism, and would only excite a smile in\nthe wider scientific knowledge of the present day. It is, however,\nnow known, as Thouvenel conjectured, that there are subterraneous\nelectric currents, the strength of which fluctuates in various places\nand from time to time. It is certainly a curious coincidence, if it be\nno more, that upwards of one hundred years ago this French physician,\non the faith of Bleton's sensations, maintained that these electrical\nmanifestations appeared in general to run east and west.3 Current\nelectricity itself was not discovered till ten years later, the existence\nof earth currents was not known till Barlow's experiments in 1849, and\nthe general trend of these currents east and west was a still more\nrecent observation.4\n1 It was in Provence (the adjoining province to Dauphiny) that Lady Milbanke,\nin 1772, first saw the use of the divining rod. In a dry, mountainous region north of\nthe Durance, the Marquis d'Ansonis had found water by a sourcier, and the Marquis,\nwhose faith in the divining rod was unbounded, converted Lady Milbanke to his\nviews after witnessing experiments on his estate.\n2 Figuier states that, owing to Bleton having indicated the existence of some\nnatural oil springs on this expedition, he was engaged on his return by the Govern\nment Department of Mines to search for similar springs in the neighbourhood of\nParis. Figuier adds, the high sanction thus given to Bleton's peculiar faculty shows\nthe estejm in which he was held, and distinguishes him from the common run of\ntourneurs de baguette.\n3 Thouvenel thought that the electrical effects, east and west, were associated\nwith all metals, except iron, which he affirms gives a north and south direction ; as he\nassociated the latter with terrestrial magnetism, this looks as if the results of his\nexperiments were often vitiated by involuntary svggeation on Thouvenel's part.\n4 There are some other curious observations in this treatise which illustrate\nThouvenel's scientific spirit. Thus, by the aid of Bleton, Thouvenel traced the\nsource of the hot springs of Bourbon Lancy to a mountainous region abounding in\ncoal ; not only sm, but a similar result appeared constantly to occur with other hot\nsprings he examined, and he affirms that eventually their origin was to be found in or\nnear masses of coal, to chemical changes in which he attributes their high temperature.\nGeologists would not, I imagine, endorse this view.

Certainly the parti pris of most of the scientific\ninvestigators of Bleton was very evident, and to a large extent vitiated\nboth the experiments made and the conclusions drawn from them.1\nThese experiments were made for the most part in the church and\ngarden of St. Genevieve in the presence of several savants. An account is\ngiven of them in the Journal de Paris for June 16th, 1782, and proces-\nverbaux of the experiments are to be found in the Journal de Physique\nof that year.2 It is needless to enter into the details ; suffice it to say\nthat the report concludes by stating that Bleton found water pipes,\nsprings, etc. on all sides, whereas there were no water pipes and no\nsprings beneath him. The attempt to explain away this failure, which\nThouvenel made, shows that believers in the divining-rod can be no less\nblind and prejudiced than their opponents. Doubtless the experiments\nwere wholly inconclusive in face of the abundant testimony in Bleton's\nfavour, some of which we have cited. The writer in the Monthly Review\nseems to have given the true explanation of these experiments. Admit\nting that Bleton did fail, he remarks, \" this will not appear surprising\nwhen we consider this poor timorous man led about blindfold, harassed,\nfatigued, and perplexed with cross questions,\" and he adds, \"even the\nAbb\u00e9 Mongez admits that Bleton was sometimes quite correct.\" In\nfact, as the Reviewer I have already quoted justly remarks :\u2014\n\" The public have no curiosity to know how far tricks and ingenious\nmeans of deception can go in disconcerting or suspending the exercise of\nrocks and the existence of past or present volcanic action,\u2014 in a word, the internal heat\nof the earth,\u2014are, I believe, the sufficient causes now recognised : but we must\nremember our author wrote upwards of a century ago.\n1 Ah the able contemporary reviewer, to whom I have already referred, remarks\n(Monthly Review, 1782, Vol. LXVII, p. 554), \"It is certainly possible that even an\nhonest zeal for the discovery of imposture or enthusiasm may be exerted in a manner\nnot perfectly adapted to the discovery of truth. . . . It is observed by all that\nBleton is uncommonly timorous and easily disconcerted, even so far as to suspend his\nimpressions. This we can well conceive, be his talent ever so real. The very talent\nseems to announce a sensibility of nerves that may render him peculiarly susceptible\nof perturbation. Who has not seen schoolboys of the most retentive memories lose\nthe remembrance of the best learned lesson by being intimidated ? \"\n- I have not seen these, and am indebted to Figuier for the references, who adds\nthat Guyton de Morveau (a well-known savant) gave some interesting details\nabout Bleton in the Journal dc Nancy.\n\f272 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nBleton's natural talent ; they only desire to know whether he in reality\npossesses this talent, when left to himself and allowed the free use of his\nfaculties.\" \u00bb\nBut, like all other dowsers, Bleton unquestionably failed at times.\nFiguier names four places, and also \"dans quelques \" autres lieux,\"\nwhere wells were dug at the spots indicated by Bleton and no water\nfound, even when the wells were sunk to a depth lower than had been\nestimated by the sourcier. In his able paper on the Divining Rod,\nread before the American Institute of Mining Engineers in 1883, Dr.\nRossiter Raymond quotes, \u2014without, however, naming his authority, \u2014\nseveral instances where Bleton failed to find the same spot, after being\nblindfolded, that he had indicated previously. These experiments are\nprobably those to which we have referred on the last page, and com\nmented on by the Monthly Review for 1782.2\nAfter the lapse of a century it is instructive to notice how fre\nquently the adverse criticism of Bleton arose from his critics assuming\na particular explanation of the lad's sensitiveness, or of the motion of\nhis rod, and having demolished their theory, they roundly asserted the\nboy was a charlatan,\u2014a mode of argument not unknown to scientific\ncritics of the S.P.R. at the present day.\nThus, Bleton's sensitiveness being supposed to be due to some\nelectric influence, he was mounted on an insulating stool and his rod\nat once ceased to move, but resumed its motion when he was on the\nground. A famous physicist, Charles, who conducted this experiment\na century ago, when Bleton was on the insulating stool, secretly con\nnected the lad with a wire to the earth ; still the rod remained passive\nalthough the insulation was destroyed. Whereupon Bleton was openly\ndenounced as a charlatan by his scientific critic. All that this ex\nperiment proves is the influence of suggestion on the motion of the\nrod. As the lad knew nothing of electricity, he must have been told\nthat the insulating stool would intercept the power, and so the rod\nceased to move when he was mounted on the glass-legged stool, and it\nremained motionless when the insulation was destroyed, as care had\nbeen taken to avoid any suggestion of this reaching Bleton. I made\na precisely similar experiment with a dowser at Waringstown, in\ni Monthly Review, Vol. LXVII. p. 555.\n* This is the case, I have since ascertained. Dr. Raymond has derived his infor\nmation from Kiguier's excellent essay on the Baguette Divinatoire, published a few\nyears ago, but he does not give the facto quite correctly : moreover, followmg the\nexample of many others who ignore what they cannot explain, he dismisses in a few\nwords the abundant testimony that exists as to Bleton's successes, fairly enough given\nby Figuier, and emphasises (in fact, exaggerates) any failures that were reported.\nChevreul did just the same ;\u2014see, e.g., p. 113 of his work on the Baguette Divinatoire,\npublished in 1854.\n\fxxxviii.] On tJ\u0153 So-called Divining Rod. 273\nIreland, in 1896 (see previous Report, Vol. XIII., pp. 80 and 246), and\nthe result was exactly the same ; when the dowser believed he was not\nin electrical connection with the earth, his twig ceased to move ; when\nhe believed he was electrically connected, the forked twig instantly\ntwisted round, though the electrical condition was the same in both\ncases. The object of my experiment was to dispose of the widely\nspread but mistaken idea that insulation prevents the motion of the\nrod. Even on his own hypothesis, the French experimenter with\nBleton was mistaken; for the theory that some electrical influence\nfrom underground water affects the dowser, and so starts the motion\nof the rod, is not touched by insulating the dowser ; as every tyro\nknows, standing on a glass-legged stool merely prevents electric con\nduction from the earth and does not impair electric induction. This\nlatter, though a plausible hypothesis, has, however, no experimental\nevidence in its favour and need not be here discussed.\nAgain, the eminent astronomer, Lalande, believed he had conclu\nsively demonstrated Bleton was a rogue because he established the\nfact that the peculiar rod Bleton employed could be rotated by sleight-\nof-hand. The fallacy of this line of argument, though persisted in at the\npresent day, has already been pointed out (see p. 141, etc). As, how\never, Lalande is often quoted as having \" exposed \" Bleton, it is worth\ngiving in extenso the communication which this famous savant made to\nthe Journal des Savants, (or S\u00e7avans as it was then spelt) for August,\n1782, p. 558. Here is the quotation from the copy in the British\nMuseum :\u2014\n\"Un nomm\u00e9 Bl\u00e9ton, n\u00e9 dans un village, pr\u00e8s de Grenoble, a pr\u00e9tendu\navoir un propri\u00e9t\u00e9 extraordinaire de sentir les eaux souterainnes par un\ntremblement convulsif.

Nevertheless, the\n\fxxxvin.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 275\nweight of Lalande's authority crushed Thouvenel and his prote'ge\"\nBleton. It was taken as a matter of course that the latter was\na clever trickster, who had duped the public. Conjuring books\nshowed how to work the rod a la Bleton. A book by H. Decremps,\ncalled La Magie devoiUe, published in Paris in 1784-, devotes a lengthy\nchapter to this, showing not only how to rotate a slightly curved rod\n(held as in Fig. 18) by the quivering of the index fingers, but also how\na manikin can be made to imitate the search for water in this fashion.\nThis chapter was copied into the Encyclope'dis Methodique for 1792,\nand an English translation of Decremps' book was published in 1785\nunder the title of The Conpirer unmasked . . . with directionsfor\nthe tricks of the Divining Rod. But the whirligig of time brings its\nrevenge ; Decremps, whose book was all the vogue a century ago, is\nto-day forgotten, and Bleton is now the subject of scientific study.\nThe rotation of Bleton's nearly straight rod was no doubt due to\nthe same cause as the twisting of the forked twig of the dowser at the\npresent day, viz., an involuntary muscular movement arising from\nsome sub-conscious suggestion (see p. 291); how he, in common with\nother dowsers, derived this usually correct suggestion of underground\nwater, when no one else knew of its presence, is the problem that we\nmust consider in the sequel to this paper (see Part XIII.).\nThouvenel gives no picture of Bleton nor of his manner of holding\nthe rod. I have searched through many works in the hope of finding\na picture given by some contemporary writer of the use of this curved\nrod, and at last discovered the accompanying drawing given in the\nreprint of Amoretti's papers entitled Rhabdomanzia, from the copy of\nthe German translation of which, published in 1809 (in the Royal\nSociety Library), Fig. 18 is reproduced. The picture shows the lad\nPennet holding the rod as Bleton did, but the rod appears rather\nlarger and more curved than Bleton's rod. Thouvenel, and afterwards\nAmoretti, experimented with Pennet (see p. 246).\nHere I must conclude the report of this remarkable dowser, which\nhas grown to a length much greater than I anticipated. My apology\nmust be that it is the first time a full summary of the evidence has\nbeen presented to the English public.\nx 2\n\f276 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nPART XI.\nInvoluntary Muscular Action and the Motion of the Rod,\nPendule, or other Autoscopk. Motor Automatism.\n\u00a7 1. Evidence as to the Involuntary and Uncontrollable\nMotion of the Rod.\nTo an onlooker, who sees a dowser at work for the first time, one\nOf the most startling things is the sudden and apparently spontaneous\nmotion of the forked twig, a motion so vigorous that one of the limbs\nof the twig is frequently broken, whilst the dowser is apparently doing\nhis utmost to restrain its motion. The common explanation of a\nsceptical public is that this is merely a trick on the dowser's part to\nmystify his dupes, but the evidence I have adduced, both in the\nprevious and present Report, shows that this view is quite untenable.1\nThe only other alternative recognised by scientific men is that the\nmotion of the twig must be caused by some involuntary muscular\naction on the part of the dowser. It is true Melancthou and the rest\nof the learned world of the sixteenth century thought that the motion\noriginated in the twig itself, and was a necessary consequence of the\n\"law of sympathy2,\" but the learned Jesuit Father Kircher (one of\nthe founders of experimental science) about the year 1650 showed that\nthe twig itself was inert, and that in some way the motion was com\nmunicated from the dowser himself 3 to the forked twig. Malebranche\nand Lebrun, fifty years after this, urged with resistless logic that\nthe explanation of the divining rod was to be found in the sport of\ngood-natured or mischievous devils, \" the badinage of demons \" ; but\nwhether these philosophers thought the demons got hold of the end of\nthe stick and twisted it, or gave supernormal strength and skill to\nthe dowser, I do not know4. This spirit theory, apparently, is the\nview of some people at the present day. Spirits may swarm in the\n1 1 am referring to honest dowsers ; impostors may exist here as elsewhere.\n3 Every age has its fashionable fetishes, or idola theatri; this \" law of sympathy\"\nwas a notable idol of the learned world in the 16th and 17th centuries. The move\nment of the rod to hidden veins of metal or water was supposed to be due to the\n\" sympathy \" between certain kinds of wood and metals, etc.\n3 See Kircher's Magnes sivc de Arte Magnctica (1640), p. 724, and his later work,\nMundus Subterraneiu, Vol. II., p. 200.\n4 Malebranche refers Lebrun to both St. Augustine and Porphyry in support of\nhis view that the devils cannot be always at work tempting mankind, but must have\nmoments of relaxation like human beings ! Hence come their little jokes in table\nrapping, opening doors, etc., so Porphyry thinks. (See Lettres qui dicouvrent \/'illusion\ndel philosophes $ur la baguette. Paris, 1693, p. 230, et seq.)\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 277\nneighbourhood of mediums and dowsers, only it needs a good deal of\nevidence to prove it, and it will be some time before science will accept\nany evidence of that kind. Hence the only alternative before us is\nthat some involuntary and more or less unconscious muscular action\non the dowser's part causes the twig to turn and sometimes break.\nIn the previous Report I have discussed this question (see pp. 243\nand 244) and shown that the curious muscular spasm, which probably\ncauses the motion of the rod, is certainly involuntary, and,\u2014when the\nrod is held as some dowsers hold it,\u2014cannot be intentionally imitated\nby a conscious effort, without considerable skill in legerdemain. To\nthis statement the only criticism I have received is from those who\nmaintain that this is an inadequate explanation, and that the evidence\npoints to some power beyond involuntary muscular action. Here is\nthe view of that distinguished naturalist and acute observer, Dr.\nA. R. Wallace, F.R.S., who writes to me as follows :\u2014\nIf the rod does move wholly by muscular action, it does not at all affect\nthe power of the dowser in finding water, \u2014but the fact should be proved.\nTo me, the evidence you adduce shows that it is not muscular action, and if\nthis can be proved it, of course, places the dowser in the rank of a physical\n\" medium,\" which I have always held him to be. If the two facts you state\nare facts : (1) That the motion of the rod cannot be intentionally produced\n(by any novice) without visible muscular action of an energetic kind ; and\n(2) that in an outsider's hands, holding the rod for the first time, it will\noften move if the dowser holds his wrists, and with no conscious, and little\nvisible, muscular action on the experimenter's part,\u2014then it follows that\nthe motion is not produced by muscular action at all, but is a physical\nphenomenon analogous to hundreds of others occurring in the presence of\n\"mediums.\"\n\u2022 I think you should have said : \"The obvions explanation, of course, is\nthat the rod is moved by the hands of the operator, acting consciously or\nunconsciously. There are, however, many difficulties in the way of this\nview, and many facts which seem directly opposed to it.\" After which your\nvarious statements would follow naturally. Now, they seem to me to be in\nthe nature of a non sequitur ! . . .\nOf course, I am a confirmed lunatic in these matters, so excuse the ravings\nOf a lunatic, but sincere, friend, AmMB R WallaC\u00a3\nAll that Mr. Wallace writes is worth attention ; it would certainly\nhave been wiser on my part, in the last Report, to have used the words\nhe suggests rather than the more dogmatic phrase I employed. Other\ncorrespondents have also urged that muscular action, whether conscious\nor unconscious, is an insufficient explanation of the phenomena actually\nobserved. In the Journal of the S. P. R. for December, 1897, Mr.\nE. T. Bennett cites some of the evidence I gave in the previous Report\nin support of this view. Mr. Bennett urges, with much cogency, that\nas Faraday's explanation of table-turning being due to involuntary\n\f278 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nmuscular action is now recognised as inadequate to cover all the\nphenomena of this kind, so in like manner this explanation fails to\ncover all the cases of the twisting of the divining rod, and hence some\nother cause, external to the dowser, is probably at work. There is no\ndoubt some force in Mr. Bennett's argument, to which I replied in the\nsame number of the Journal.\nThe descriptions given by different observers are so similar that\nwe may take them as correct, and certainly it would seem that no\nconscious muscular action could produce the effects described. Mr.\nBennett (Journal S.P.R., December, 1897) therefore asks, \"Have we\nany grounds which justify us in attributing to unconscious muscular\naction, physical effects which it is beyond the power of conscious\nmuscular action to produce 1 \" My reply is : in hypnosis, somnambulism,\nhysteria, etc., subjects can perform muscular feats impossible to them\nin their normal self-conscious state. Whatever tends to concentrate\nmuscular action upon one single dominant idea enables the subject to\naccomplish what otherwise he could not do. Moreover known causes\nmust be assumed as operative until they are proved to be inadequate.\nThe two facts, (1) and (2), named by Mr. A. R. Wallace in his letter,\nare, however, sometimes disputed, and it is therefore desirable to cite\nsome of the facts already given and add further information, from\ndifferent witnesses, on these two points.\nThe violence of the motion of the rod is shown in numerous cases\nI quoted in the previous Report. Thus on p. 7, Mr. Enys, F.G.S., who\nis an amateur dowser, states \" the rod broke short off in front of my\nhands, and did so a second time in the same place,\" i.e., where under\nground water existed. On p. 26, Miss Grantham (daughter of Judge\nGrantham), describing what occurred with the Rev. J. Blunt, another\namateur dowser, states \" so strong was the impulse, that we found\nunless Mr. B. relaxed his hold, the twig broke off near his fingers.\"\nLady Milbanke, also an amateur dowser, had the same experience,\np. 42.1 Mr. Percy Clive states, on p. 35, that when he held the rod\nand Mullins put his hands on his wrists, the rod \" twisted round in\nmy hands with such force that when I held it tight it broke.\" Mr.\nCecil Woolley, of Lincoln, the agent to Trinity College, Cambridge,\nstates, on p. 242, that the late J. Mullins having gone over the ground\nand indicated water in one spot, \" I took the twig in my own hands\nand went over the same spot with no result. He (J. Mullins) then took\nhold of my wrists without touching the twig himself and when we\ntogether walked over the same place, the twig turned up in my hands.\nThis was, I suppose, caused by muscular action on my part, but if so, it\n1 The pages in this paragraph all refer to the previous Report, iVoceedinj\/s\nS.P.R., Vol. XIII.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 279\nwas certainly, as far as I was concerned, perfectly unconscious action.\nMy mental attitude was one of neutrality ! \" Lord Burton makes a\nvery similar statement, p. 103. Mr. Budd, a geologist, describes what\noccurred with Mullins when he came over underground water at\n\"Waterford. He writes, p. 110, \" Mullins held the forked twig between\nhis second and third fingers as if you were going to write, the point of\nthe fork downwards. At No. 1 [i.e., over the spot where a large\nsupply of underground water was found] the point lifted itself up,\nuntil it turned over backwards and twisted itself until it broke . . .\nThe clerks then held [another forked twig] with him, and held his\nhands ; always the same effect.\" In another place, seeing the frantic\nmotion of the twig when Mullins came over underground water, a\ngentleman tried to stop its motion by gripping the twig in two places\nwith smiths' tongs, \" one pair securing the tips and the other the fork,\nbut the contortions still went on between the points held,\" p. 87,\nand so on.\nIn the present Report numerous independent witnesses of unim\npeachable integrity and some with high scientific attainments testify\nto the same class of facts, viz. :\u2014(1) the automatic and apparently\nirresistible motion of the twig in the hands often of a complete\nnovice, and (2) that, when the forked twig does not move in a person's\nhands, if the dowser takes one limb of the twig, or even places his\nhand on the wrist of the insensitive person, the previously inert twig\nnow turns vigorously and often breaks in two in the effort to resist its\nmotion. As regards (1), see the letter from the President of the\nRoyal Geological Society of Cornwall on p. 219,1 who states that the\nclerk of his Parish Council, on finding the rod suddenly twist in his\nhands, called out, \" It is alive, sir, it is alive ! \" Mr. Enys adds :\n\" This exactly describes the sensation when the rod moves.\" Mr.\nDixon, a large fruit-grower in California, on p. 250 states : \" I held\nthe stick as tight as I could to prevent its moving, but it twisted right\nround.\" Mr. Denison, of the Toronto Meteorological Observatory, on\np. 206, gives a careful record of the violent twisting of a forked plum\nstick or bent wire used as a divining rod by an amateur dowser. Mr.\nBennett, of Oxford, on p. 176, refers to the frantic motion and\nultimate breaking of the twig \" held firmly \" in the dowser's hands.\nOther similar cases will have been noted by the careful reader. As\nregards (2), see Mr. Morton's letter to The Engineer given on p. 172 ;\nMr. Morton found the rod would not move in his hands, but when the\nlate John Mullins, the dowser, \"laid his hands on my wrists and\ngrasped them firmly, then the twig instantly began to turn and con\ntinued turning till he removed his hands. He never touched the twig\n1 The pages in this paragraph refer to the present Report.\n\f280 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nwhile it was in my hands.\" Mr. Montague Price, in his letter on\np. 181, states :\u2014\nI held one side of the forked rod myself and the \"diviner\" the other, and\nwhen we came to water [alleged underground water] the strain was so great\non my fingers I was obliged to ask him to stop. From the position of the\nrod it was absolutely impossible for him to produce the pressure, which\nincreased with the strength of the stream.\nMr. Denison, of Toronto, states, on p. 206, that his friend \" Mrs.\nHarris tried without any result ; but when Mr. H. [who was an\namateur dowser] grasped her wrists, as she approached the spring, the\nrod turned forcibly,\" and so on.\nThe usual practice, after watching a dowser at work, is for some\nof the onlookers to try if the forked twig will move in their hands.\nGenerally speaking, one or more, out of perhaps ten or twelve persons,\ndiscover to their astonishment that the twig curls up in their hands\nat the same places at which it did with the dowser. Here is such\nan experience. Mrs. Hollands writes to me as follows :\u2014\nDene Park, Tonbridge, October 9th, 1899.\nIn answer to your note of inquiry about the divining rod, the whole\nthing is rather a long story, but the practical result of the water dowser's\nvisit was to find water which now supplies the house. One of my daughters\nfound she had the strange power which moves the divining rod, and it works\nfor her now quickly over any spring. It is most interesting, as you can feel\nthe rod if you take one side of it and take one of her hands, she holding the\nother end of the rod\u2014it struggles up, and would break off altogether if you\ndid not allow it to move. My daughter has since found several springs on\nthe estate, where we have sunk wells.

Several of the country\npeople in this neighbourhood (Somerset) have the gift. It has never been\nknown to fail.\nPersonally, I was rather sceptical on the subject, but was converted by\nthe stick turning in my hands when standing over a spring. There were\nabout six persons present at the time ; all tried it, but it would turn for no\none excepting the man in the picture and myself. I experienced a sort of\ntingling sensation in my arms and wrists, but otherwise was quite unaware\nwhen the forked stick began to turn, it seemed to go over so quickly.\nMaude Craioie Halkett.\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 281\nMiss Halkett does not say how she knew she was \" standing over\na spring \" when the twig turned in her hands : this statement is very\ncharacteristic of many others that have reached me.\nI received the following from a Civil Engineer, Mr. J. W. Parry,\nwho also sent me an interesting article he had written on water-finding,\nwhich appeared in the Pioneer of India :\u2014\n19, Southmoor Road, Oxford, Noeember 2nd, 1898.\nI have read with much interest your work on \" dowsing \" in the Psychical\nResearch Society. I was a sceptic, but after reading the 140 cases you\nmention, it is quite impossible to doubt any longer. I was lately at Padstow,\nCornwall, where the following authenticated case occurred which you might\nlike to verify.\nIt appears a dowser was lately sent for, as some waterworks were\nprojected. The squire, Mr. Prideaux-Brune, and his two daughters came\nto see the operations of the divining rod . On a spot being indicated by the\ndowser, one of the young ladies said, \" Oh ! let me see if I can do it.\"\nUnfortunately, she had not the gift, nor had her sister. Squire Prideaux-\nBrune, then taking the twig, walked back a few paces. On passing the spot\nhis arms shook violently, and would not be controlled. The young ladies\nwere laughingly sceptical, and said, \" Oh ! papa, you are humbugging.\"\nHe replied, \" I am doing nothing of the kind, and can't help my arms\nshaking,\" or words to that effect.\nYou do not mention any cases as occurring in India, where there is a\na good deal of so-called divining. I have seen diviners lying naked with their\nears to the ground, pretending that they could hear the subterranean water.\nDon't you think that's somewhat beyond our ken, even though the Asiatic\nhas marvellously sensitive organs of hearing on certain occasions 1\nJ. W. Parry,\nLate Executive Engineer, Indian State Railways.\nI wrote to Mr. Prideaux-Brune, who is a Deputy-Lieutenant and\nJ.P. for the county, and received the following reply : \u2014\nPrideaux Place, Padstow, Cornwall, February 11th, 1899.\nSome months ago Messrs. Merryweather sent a diviner here, so I\nwitnessed his extraordinary powers. I myself manifested a slight power, and\nwhen the diviner held my wrists it was intensified\u2014one man, a non-believer,\nwas as successful as the diviner. Another man attempted, and was not in\nthe slightest degree affected, even when the diviner held his wrists. A very\nstrong man tried to wrest this rod from the diviner's hands without success,\nand, finally, in the struggle the rod broke. In my own case I felt the\nmuscles in my arm between the hand and the elbow for a day or two\naffected in the same way as if I had a slight electric shock.\nCharles G. Prideaux-Brune.\nIn this case, as in the former, there is no evidence to show that the\ninvoluntary motion of the \" rod \" had any connection with the near\nness of underground water.\n\f282 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nI will now cite some evidence that shows (1) how little visible mus\ncular action there is when the twig moves in the hands of a dowser; e.g.,\nMr. A. Lang says (see below) he \"could detect no muscular action ;\" and\nfurther (2) how the amateur in whose hands the twig turns believes\nhe is exerting his will and muscular force to prevent its motion.\nIn Longman's Magazine (November, 1897) Mr. A. Lang writes :\u2014\nI have thrice been with amateurs, in whose hands a twig twisted over\nsubterranean water. One was a very learned professor of the Greek language,\nwho, having seen the thing done by a water-finder, found that he had the\nsame faculty. The second was a land bailiff, who had discovered his gift in\nthe same way, and employed it for his own purposes on his employer's estate.\n. . . The third was a lady, whose mother had the faculty, and found her\nown well by using it. I tried, in company with each of the three. With the\ntwo men I failed\u2014my twig would not turn where theirs turned. It did twist\nwhere the lady's twisted, and the sensation was curious [\"just as if the\nrod were alive,\" Mr. Lang adds in writing to me] ; but I am inclined to\nfancy that the mere resistance and spring of the wood caused it to jerk itself\nupward at one spot, though I cannot say why it failed to do so at other spots.\nThe bailiff tried holding my wrists while I held the twig, but without effect.\nI held his fingers, when the twig writhed in his hands, but could detect no\nmuscular action on his part. In no case did we dig, or make any attempt\nto find water where the twigs twisted ; all we were able to do was to\nexamine the action of the twig ; active at certain spots, passive at others.\nThe forked twig is so held that you resist its natural spring. Of course, no\ntwig at all is used by some water-finders, who rely on their sensations\nmerely, and speak of the twig as a mere index or stage property.\nIn Sir Herbert Maxwell's pleasant book of sport and natural history,\nMemories of the Months, is an account of experiments with Mullins, a\nprofessional, and not a man of education. Mullins had worked at Middleton,\nand Lord Jersey ' ' had been not only gratified, but astonished at his success.\"\nExperiments were next made at Osterley, before scientific characters . . .\nMullins's rod, in this case, \"twisted so violently that, when he held it tight,\nit broke in his hand.\" He said that he had a shivering along his spine on\nthese occasions. When he stood on a plate of thick glass the rod did not\ntwist, which he attributed to the non-conducting of electricity. An\nuneducated man always chatters about electricity. The glass acted, if at\nall, byway of negative \"suggestion.\" Mullins was then blindfolded, but\nhere Sir James Crichton-Browne objected that the blindfolding was\ninadequate. The researches of the Psychical Society have proved (in other\nexperiments) that practically no blindfolding is adequate, or, at least, is\nbeyond suspicion. Sir James wanted to introduce cotton wool. Mullins said,\n\"Don't you believe my word ? \" Sir James replied, \" I believe nothing but\nwhat I see \" (not a very scientific posture, I fear), and Mullins would not\nplay any longer. He was an uneducated man ; he did not understand the\nposition ; he took Sir James's agnosticism as a personal affront, and so the\nmatter ended. Nevertheless, Sir Herbert says, \"were I in straits to find\nwater, I should employ without hesitation a professional water-finder\u2014rod\nand all\u2014if there remains one as successful as Mullins was.\"\n\fXxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 283\nPractically the dowser finds water in a paying ratio of successes over\nfailures. How he finds it he probably does not know himself. I do not\ndoubt that the rod is wagged (where the finder is honest) by unconscious\nmuscular action, as in \"table-turning.\" So we are left at largo in that\ncheerful and luminous field of inquiry, the Philosophy of the Unconscious,\nor Subconscious. Some indication, through the normal senses perhaps, or\nthrough some unexplored sense, reaches the successful finder, and, uncon\nsciously obedient to this hint, he unconsciously uses his muscles and wags\nthe stick. I conceive that to be the humour of it, but a large number of\nexperiments is needed before one can even raise a good presumption in\nfavour of the hypothesis.\nThe following letter which Dr. Hodgson has sent me is an illus\ntration of the involuntary and apparently uncontrollable motion of\nthe rod in the hands of a mining engineer, who tried it for the first\ntime :\u2014\n350, East 69th Street, New York, July 23rd, 1892.\nI see a paper on the diviniDg rod in Vol. II. of your Proceedings, and\nwould bring to your notice a curious experience of mine with regard to this\nwhich I published in the Engineering and Mining Journal of December 9th,\n1876, which created quite a discussion in that journal.\n\"I was much interested in that part of a lecture on Mining by Professor\nW. Smyth, F.R.S., of the Royal School of Mines, London, relating to the use\nof the divining rod for finding mineral veins or subterranean springs of water,\nand published in your journal of September 9th. Because a reason cannot\nbe given for an alleged phenomenon is no cause why it should not exist, or\nif existing, why it should not be inquired into. Most of the discoveries of\nscience would not have been made, had inexplicable phenomena been set\naside as being unworthy of attention because no reason could be given for\nthem at the time when first observed.\n\"I have heard of the Cornish Witch,hazel from my childhood, but\nalways thought it a fable till one day in the woods of Pennsylvania one of\nmy men mentioned that springs could be found by means of a forked switch\nof any kind of fresh cut hard wood. I laughed at the idea, but he insisted,\nso I made a trial by standing astride a small brook, one branch of the fork\nin each hand, the stem standing out horizontally. What was my amazement\nto find that the latter bent slowly down with a force I was entirely unable,\nto counteract. The experiment was quite .sufficient to make me credit all\nthat had been attested of the divining rod, though I have never tried it\nover mineral veins.\n\" Professor Smyth says that all persons are not able to produce the\neffect, which may very well be, just as Spiritualists pretend that some\npersons are naturally more adapted to act as mediums than others. And\nmay not the power exerted by them on chairs and tables have some con\nnection with the force manifested by means of the divining rod ? Unless,\nindeed, the force which makes the twig bend be caused by the vital power\nof the person holding it. These, however, are the very questions to be\nsolved, should a competent person take them up. s\n\f284 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\n\"I am glad to see that so distinguished a man as Professor Smyth has\nthe courage to assert his belief iti what it is the fashion to consider as an\nexploded fallacy by persons who have never tried it or made proper inquiries\nregarding it.\"\nThat some unknown force is at work I am confident. It seems\nmelancholy that the very men who pooh-pooh such phenomena merely\nbecause they cannot explain them, are of the class generally called scientific.\nD. COGHLaN.\nDr. Hodgson wrote to Mr. Coghlan suggesting that unconscious\nmuscular action was the probable cause of the motion of the rod ; Mr.\nCoghlan replies as follows :\u2014\n350, East 69th Street, New York, Jidy 29<\/i, 1892.\nYour favour of yesterday received. In answer to your suggestion that my\nown unconscious muscular force caused the bending of the rod, I can answer\ndecisively, No !\nAVhen I said to my informant regarding the phenomenon that I could by\nmy muscular exertion prevent the bending, he expressed the situation\nforcibly by saying the bark of the twig would be first twisted off. Of course\nin this he exaggerated, but still it expressed, rather forcibly to be sure, the\ntendency of the twig's point downwards. The switch is held with the palms\nof the hand turned upward and the branches of the fork grasped firmly, the\nmain stem projecting horizontally. I cannot conceive how any unconscious\nmuscular action could cause the horizontal stem to become vertical, which\nposition is attained by a twisting of the fibres of the wood.\n1 have lately tried the same experiment under what I considered similar\ncircumstances, but failed completely, whether owing to the wood used not\nbeing of the proper kind, (for you may remember that in Cornwall they\nsuppose the witch-hazel the proper thing to use in searching for mineral\nveins), or whether owing to decay of nervous power on my part through age, I\n\u20acM,not telh D. Coghlan.\nThe opinion so emphatically expressed by Mr. Coghlan, that the\nmotion of the rod was not due to any muscular action, conscious or un\nconscious, on his part is shared by nearly all who find the rod twist in\ntheir hands. Here, for example, is one of numerous instances I might\ncite. In a letter published in the Standard newspaper for January 2nd,\n1 889, Mr. W. Bell, of East-Lyss, Petersfield, states that after seeing a\ndowser at work, he tried the forked twig himself and to his utter amaze\nment, when he came near the spot at which the twig moved with the\ndowser, he saw the point bend forward and then it suddenly turned\ndown towards the ground as he crossed the spot. He adds :\u2014\nSome force independent of my will, and acting contrary to my muscular\nresistance, drew the point of the twig towards the earth. Of this I am as\nfirmly convinced as I am that the sun rose yesterday. It was not a matter\nin which I could have been self-deceived, and the same effects could not be\nproduced by trickery [voluntary effort is no doubt meant].\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 285\nIn the same number of the Standard a professional dowser, J.\nBlanchard, of Wisbech, writes to say that he has \" proved the rod is\nnot moved by the involuntary action of mental expectancy on the\nmuscles of the performer \" (!), by putting on a pair of gloves, when the\nrod ceases to move. No doubt the rod would be more difficult to\nmanipulate, whether voluntarily or otherwise, with gloves on. But all\nthese results, however, like the standing on insulating supports, etc.,\nare mainly due to what Mr. A. Lang, in the passage just quoted, calls\n\" negative suggestion.\" That is to say, anything which gives rise to a\nsub-conscious suggestion determines the motion or arrest of the rod.\nIn connection with this I may cite the distinguished anthropo\nlogist, Dr. E. B. Tylor, F.R.S., who, in a lecture delivered at Oxford in\n1883, relates his experience with the divining rod as follows :\u2014\n\"I happened to be staying at a friend's house in the Mendip district,\nwhere it [the divining-rod] is still used by well-sinkers and miners, and at\nmy request a regular practitioner was sent for. ... It does not appear that\nhe fraudulently moves the rod, but my sensations led me to agree with\nChevreul that the slight movements of the hands are unconsciously guided\nto accumulate into impulses sufficient to cause the twig to dip or rise. I\nnoticed that when I could allow my attention to stray, the rod would from\ntime to time move in my hands in a way so lifelike that an uneducated\nperson might well suppose the movement to be spontaneous. It is hardly\nnecessary to say that the rod always moves where the bearer's mind suggests\nan object.\" [Dr. Tylor then gives an amusing illustration on this point :\nthe dowser having stated the rod always moved when he reached the main\nspring underground, the rod also moved over a watch, the dowser suggesting\nthat it did so because it was over the mainspring of the watch ; his mind,\nDr. Tylor remarks, being controlled by the verbal association into a d\u00ablusive\nanalogy of effects] (Nature, May 17th, 1883, p. 58).\n\u00a7 2. Evidence that the Motion of the Rod is due to Unconscious\nMuscular Action.\nWe will now pass on to evidence which shows that the motion of\nthe rod i3 really due to the muscular action of the dowser, notwith\nstanding that there are certain positions in which the rod is held\nwhere it seems to be impossible for the dowser to move it. Such, for\nexample, as that shown in the plate on page 134, in my previous\nReport, where the dowser, Stone, is shown holding a thick forked rod\ndepending from the forefinger, second finger, and thumb of each\nhand. Mr. Stone himself asserts that there is no movement of his\nfingers, and that he holds the rod in this way because it cannot be\nmoved by the dowser ; but a careful eye-witness, Mr. R. J. Charleton,\nwrites to me as follows :\u2014\nI must contradict the assertion that no movement of Mr. Stone's fingers\ncould be detected whilst he is using the divining rod. I watched him most\n\f286 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nclosely, and distinctly noticed that his forefingers, second fingers and\nthumbs, between which he held the ends of the forked stick, were strongly\ncompressed upon the pliant wood. At the same time there was an inward\ntwisting action of the fingers which had the effect of raising the apex of the\nrod. Tremendous muscular force was apparently being used, to such an\nextent, in fact, that the operator's hands became quite swollen and tremulous\nwhen he had completed his experiments. I have myself been able to verify\nthis explanation in my own person repeatedly, though I could not move\nsuch thick twigs as Mr.. Stone employs, but his muscular development is\ngreater than mine and ho is in constant practice.\nI, too, watched Mr. Stone carefully in his use of the forked rod.\nIn the Carrigoona experiments, the sudden leaping up, as it were, of\nthe twig when Mr. Stone came to the position No. 1 in Fig. 3 was\nmost remarkable, the more so considering the way the twig was held.\nThere was evidently some muscular spasm, as Mr. Charleton says, but\nit was obviously involuntary, and neither I nor a friend who was with\nme could imitate the action by any conscious exertion on our part.\nBut perhaps the best testimony is afforded by the following letter\nI received from Mr. J. F. Young, of Llanelly, a most successful\namateur dowser, animated by a truly scientific spirit. Mr. Young\nwas at first inclined to think that the movement of the rod was\nentirely spontaneous and quite independent of the dowser, but after I\nhad drawn his attention to the matter, he writes as follows : \" I see\nthat the motion of the rod, which is always held in tension by the\nwater-finder, is really due to unconscious muscular action ; this is\nspecially noticeable with a watch-spring which I generally employ.\nIn fact, I am so convinced in this matter, after endless experiments,\nthat I defy any one to prove the contrary.\" A Somersetshire incum\nbent, writing in Notes and Queries,1 gives corroborative testimony,\nand states that, when holding the rod in the same way as the pro\nfessional dowser he employed, \" the harder I grasped the stick to\nprevent it turning, the more it turned, till at last it broke in two, and\nhurt \/he hand that held it.\"\nBut this is no new explanation of the motion of the rod, for the\nfullest and best account of its motion,\u2014based upon experimental\nevidence, \u2014is given by the American writer to whom I have already\nreferred, Mr. Emerson, in the pages of the American Journal of Science\n(SUliman's Journal) for 1826. The writer shows how startling and\napparently miraculous is the sudden motion of the rod, in the hands of\na good water-finder, \u2014and remarks, if there be a fraud, the diviners are\nthemselves the dup.\u00b0s. It is true, he goes on to say, that nearly every\none can urge it to turn iu a fashion, but only in the hands of a very\nfew does it move, not only without urging, but contrary to their best\ni Series 1, Vol. X. (1854), p. 155.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 287\nefforts. He himself tried again and again, but failed. At last, one\nday, watching a young and successful diviner, he noticed the peculiar\nspirit and air of determination with which he handled the rod.\nHoping to catch his lively manner [Mr. Emerson says] I took the rod\nand tried my hand again. When I got to the bank of the rivulet the rod\nbegan to move, and I could not restrain it. He who for the first time in his\nlife has received an electric shock will recognise the sensation which I\nexperienced when I felt the limbs of the rod crawling round, and saw the\npoint turning down in spite of every effort my clenched hands could make\nto restrain it. In this contest between myself and the rod the bark was\nstripped off the twig. The secret appeared to be to hold the rod in a\nspirited manner [by this he apparently means a determined and confident,\nnot a weak and hesitating, manner], for since then the rod has never failed\nto move in my hands, nor in the hands of those I have instructed.\nMr. Emerson then gives directions how to hold the rod in order to\nexhibit its startling motion ; if the diviner releases his firm grasp, he\ngoes on to say :\u2014\nThe rod can no more turn than an unbent bow can throw an arrow.\nBy grasping the forked rod smartly the bow is strained and then if the rod\nbe pliant and the hands moist, it will creep round slowly and mysteriously.\nBut if the rod be large, its motion when smartly bent may become\nungovernable. The direction of the motion of the rod forwards or back\nwards depends on whether the wrists are allowed to turn to their natural\nposition or are slightly more strained outwards.\nTwo large goose quills tied together at their tips, or two pieces of\nwhalebone similarly fastened and held as a divining rod, Mr. Emerson\nfound to work quite as well, or even better, than a forked twig. This\npart of Mr. Emerson's paper is excellent, but of course explains\nnothing more than the apparently spontaneous and vigorous motion\nof the rod.1\nProfessor Wadsworth, of Michigan University, has recently pub\nlished a letter in Nature- giving a similar explanation of the motion\n1 Mr. Thos. Blashill, F.R.I.B.A. (late superintendent architect of the London\nCounty Council) has sent me a lengthy and careful analysis of the illustrations given\nin my previous Report, showing the method of holding the rod, and he concludes\nthat, \" In every case in which the rod is shown in the hands of the water-finder,\nwhile he is actually searching for water, the two prongs of the fork are bent, some\ntimes slightly but often very considerably,'' and he infers that this bending accounts\nfor the motion of tho rod. No doubt a considerable strain is put on the forked rod\nby some professional dowsers, but not by all ; the explanation of the motion of the\nrod is not quite so easy as Mr. Blashill and others who have not themselves seen it in\nuse imagine. Even Mr. Emerson's and Mr. Young's statement that the rod is always\nheld in a state of strain is not invariably true. Moreover the rod used by Bleton and\nothers a century ago simply reste.d on the two forefingers : we shall deal with this in\nthe sequel.\n- \"A Mechanical Theory of the Divining Rod,\" Nature, January Gth, 1898.\nX\n\f288 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nof the twig to that given by Emerson seventy years previously. It is\namusing to see how entirely ignorant of the whole subject are many\nscientific men who are ready to instruct us. Professor Wadsworth\nsays, in concluding his letter :\u2014\nThe whole secret of the divining-rod seems to lie in its position in the\nhands of the operator, and in his voluntarily or involuntarily increasing the\ncloseness of his grasp on the two ends of the branches forming the fork.\nIf the foregoing conditions are fulfilled, the twig will always bend down\u2014\nwater or no water, mineral or no mineral. Any one can be an operator, and\nany material can be used for the instrument, provided the limbs forming the\nfork are sufficiently tough and flexible.\nAs I have said, any one can twist the rod if it is held in a\nparticular manner, but I am afraid Professor Wadsworth's contri\nbution can hardly be said to have solved \" the whole secret of\nthe divining rod.\"\nJust as a pen or pencil registers conscious acts of the brain by\nsmall muscular motions of the fingers, so the divining rod indicates\nsub-conscious acts of the brain by small and usually involuntary and in\nsensible muscular motions on the part of the so-called diviner. It is not\nnecessary to call the man who writes or who reads a letter \"a diviner,\"\nthough he is so in a sense, and it is equally unnecessary to call a man\n\" a diviner \" who employs a forked stick to indicate the twitching of\nthe muscles of his lower arm. Though the honest dowser himself\ndeclares he does not move the forked twig, this is simply a proof that\nthe motion is to him both involuntary and unconscious. It is needless\nto labour this point, but it may be worth while to dispose of it once\nfor all.\nHow, ask several correspondents, can a man move a stick, the\nmotion of which he is consciously resisting ? The muscles, it is urged,\ncannot simultaneously be doing opposite things. It certainly looks\nmysterious, but it is not really so to the trained physiologist. Through\nthe kindness of my friend, Dr. Purser, Professor of Physiology at\nTrinity College, Dublin, I have been able to have this question tested\nin the person of an amateur dowser, an Irish gentleman, to whom I\nhave already referred, Mr. J. H. Jones, who was good enough to allow\nhimself to be made the subject of experiment in the grounds of\nTrinity College, Dublin. Dr. Purser subsequently wrote to me as\nfollows :\u2014 T c D^ Decemfier 19Wli 1897\nThe interview with Mr. Jones was held under rather unfavourable circum\nstances, owing to the storm, but I think I was able to see the movement by\nwhich the turning of the stick is effected. .\nThe movements by which the stick is turned are :\u2014(1) A rotation of the\nforearms, or one of them ; (2) a flexion of the inner fingers, by which tho\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 289\nstick is made a lever of the first order with very short distance between the\nfulcrum and the power, or perhaps a lever of the third order. It was\nimpossible to follow the movements when the stick was rapidly twirled, or\nwhen Mr. Jones walked rapidly and the rod suddenly turned and he said :\n\"There is water here.\" But when he stood over the place where he said\nunderground water existed, and professed to struggle against the motion of\nthe stick, the movement was evident, and I had no difficulty in imitating\nthe movements myself, although, of course, not so dexterously as Mr. Jones\ndid. As to whether the movements are conscious or unconscious I cannot\nexpress any opinion,\u2014but that the stick is moved by the muscles of the\narm and not by any occult influence cannot be doubted, I think, by any\nreasonable being. F pDBSER\nTo the lay reader, no doubt, there is considerable difficulty in under\nstanding how this explanation covers all the facts, if such cases as those\nI have quoted earlier are correctly described. The breaking of the\nforked twig can only be accomplished by a rigid grasp of one of the\nforks, and a rotation of the twig by the hand holding the other fork.\nThis is probably what occurs ;\u2014the skill and strength required to do\nthis, without much visible motion of the hand, being as much beyond\nthe conscious effort of the dowser as the feats of a somnambulist or\nhypnotised person are beyond the power of the same person in his\nnormal state ; and the physiological explanation is probably much the\nsame in the two cases, namely, an automatic concentration and dis\ncharge of most of the available nervous energy of the individual into\none narrow channel. Only a trained anatomist is competent to give\nan opinion on this question, for he knows which muscles to observe,\nwhilst the startling effects of auto-suggestion are well known to\nphysiologists.\nIn support of this view I will here quote an extract from the report\nof a small committee who, in 1894, critically examined a dowser at\nwork. The committee of investigation consisted of the pathologist\nand the assistant physician of one of the Bristol hospitals, Mr. Mole,\nF.R.C.S., and Dr. F. H. Edgeworth,\u2014the latter having made neurology\na special study\u2014and the Rev. R. A. Chudleigh, of West Parley\nRectory, Wimborne, Dorset. Mr. Chudleigh, who acted as reporter,\nthough not an M.D., has made a life-long study of both physiology and\npathology.1 The committee were therefore well qualified. They were\nfortunate in securing the co-operation of a skilful amateur dowser, who\nplaced himself, as well as his estate (on the border of the Mendips),\nentirely at their service. In the course of a lengthy report, Mr.\nChudleigh says : \" If there be one thing which is perfectly clear, it is\n1 I have since had a considerable correspondence with the Rev. Mr. Chudleigh,\nand have been much struck with his true scientific habit of mind and wide range of\nknowledge.\nY\n\f290 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nthat the movement of the wand is due to an unconscious muscular\ncontraction, just like other muscular contractions, except that it is\nunconscious.\" Albeit, he goes on to say, \" The violent tremor which\nconvulsed the over-strained arm is itself enough to suggest witchcraft\nto an ordinary spectator, and yet I am sure that it is nothing more\nthan what is known as muscle-clonus.\" Anatomical reasons are then\ngiven to account for the sudden violent motion of the rod, and the\nreport continues : \" A precisely analogous phenomenon is seen in those\ncases where a spinal wound or a spinal poison throws the whole body\ninto universal spasm ; but the flexors master the extensors and the\nback muscles overpower the front ones, the result being the frightful\nand well-known pose called opisthotonus.\" The writer then points\nout that the sudden spontaneous tension of the muscles of the arms\nwhich occur when the dowser believes himself to be over a spring is\nprobably due to auto-suggestion ; \"this auto-suggestion makes a diviner\npositively tetanic when he knows or thinks that water is present.\"1\nThe symptoms described in the foregoing were more strikingly\nexhibited by the late Mr. W. Scott Lawrence than by most other\ndowsers ; a vivid description is given by an eye-witness on p. 69 of\nthe previous Report.8\nSevere muscular spasm, as is well known, can be caused by sugges\ntion in hypnotic subjects. In HittelFs Somnambulism and Cramp,\nNew York, 1860, muscular contractions are described as caused by\nauto-suggestion\u2014e.g., \" If Miss A. ventured to eat with a silver spoon,\nthe muscles of the mouth soon became rigid, etc.\" Every physician is\nacquainted with cases where often alarming muscular spasm, as of the\nglottis, is due to purely ideo-motor action. \" The idea of a particular\nmotion,\" as the physiologist Miiller long ago remarked, \" determines\nthe current of nervous action towards the necessary muscles, and\ngives rise to the motion independently of the will.\" Dr. Edgeworth\nsends me an instance of this under his care at the Bristol Infirmary.\nHe writes :\u2014\nA man wlio had an affection of the spinal cord was given mercury\nby injections into his arm. His legs (the part affected) got well, but he\ndeveloped the idea that his arm had been poisoned, and as a result has a\n1 See Farm and Home, May, 1894, p. 132.\n3 When Lawrence came over a place where he asserted an underground spring\nexisted\u2014and which proved true on sinking a well at the spot,\u2014the writer states :\u2014\n\" I can only describe the antics of that twig as a pitched battle between itself and\nhim !

In my opinion they afford an explanation of the\nmotion of the \" divining rod.\"\nF. H. Edgeworth.\n\u00a7 3. Consideration of Bleton's Motor-Automatism.\nIt may be argued by some readers that the foregoing explanation\nof the motion of the forked twig cannot apply to the singular and\nrapid rotation of the slightly curved rod used fey Bleton. Certainly\nthe facts, as carefully narrated by Dr. Thouvenel on pp. 53-76 of his\nfirst Me'moire, were very curious and are worth attention.\nIn the first place it is wholly improbable that the rotation of\nBleton's baguette, any more than the twisting of the forked twig by\nthe dowsers of to-day, was due to any conscious muscular effort on the\npart of the sourcier or water-finder. In fact, if the reader will try to\nrotate a slightly curved stick resting on his forefingers, as shown in\nFig. 18, p. 274, he will realise how difficult it is to accomplish, keep\ning, withal, his hands and arms as far as possible motionless. But\ndifficult as it is to imitate this motion, it is not impossible, as Lalande\nshowed in the passage I have quoted on p. 273, though I have no\ndoubt the attempt to imitate the rotation was a very clumsy one.\nFor the effects of involuntary muscular action are surprisingly difficult\nto imitate by voluntary effort. That some muscular action really took\nplace on Bleton's part is seen from Thouvenel's own admission, opposed\nas he was to this idea. On p. 114 of his first Me'moire, he says, in a\npassage I will translate :\u2014\nI have perceived several times that the approach of the arms and a\ncertain tour de main on the part of the sourcier [Bleton] contributed to\ngive the baguette its first impulse of rotation over feeble springs.\nIt is true that he does not notice this at other times : but a careful\nobserver (M. le Comte de M ) quoted by Thouvenel on p. 188 of\nhis Me'moire, says :\u2014\nI have reason to suspect that [the motion of] the baguette is a little\naided by an almost insensible movement of the shoulder.\nAlbeit the Count himself tried without success to turn the baguette\nat a spot where it moved with Bleton. Thouvenel tells us Bleton\njudged with singular accuracy of the volume of the hidden spring by\nthe rate of rotation of the baguette, as well as by the violence of the\nconvulsive movements of his body which simultaneously occurred.1\n1 I have mentioned already (p. 260) that the motion of the rod with Bleton (as\nwith some dowsers of to-day) was subsidiary to the convulsive spasm and malaise\nwhich he experienced, when, as he alleged, an underground spring existed beneath.\nT 2\n\f292 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nFurthermore, he was able to judge of the depth of the spring in the\nfollowing manner: on leaving the spot beneath which he alleged water\nwas to be found, the baguette ceased to turn, but when he had gone a\ncertain distance the baguette suddenly gave a single rotation in the\nopposite direction. The distance at which this occurred from the spot\nat which it stopped turning was, according to Bleton, the approximate\ndepth of the spring. The results given in the depositions quoted by\nThouvenel show that Bleton was usually fairly correct in his estimate\nof the depth when it did not exceed 30 ft. ; beyond that he did not\nprofess to be able to judge. One witness, however, states that even\nat small depths Bleton was often at fault.\nThe rate of rotation and the retrograde as well as the direct\nmotion of the baguette were no doubt simply ideo-motor phenomena,\nthe result of an involuntary muscular effort prompted by some auto\nsuggestion. The difficulty here, as elsewhere in our inquiry, is to\ntrace the genesis of this probably subconscious suggestion.\n\u00a7 4. Apparent Transmission of Motor-Automatism from a Sensitive\nto an Insensitive Person.\nThere is, however, another problem connected with the motion of\nthe rod which we must not pass over, and that is, the remarkable fact\nso frequently noticed that when the dowser lays hold of the wrist or\nhand of a person with whom the rod will not turn, the twig instantly\nmoves. I have quoted numerous instances of this from excellent wit\nnesses on pp. 278 and 279. This apparent transmission of the power of\ninvoluntary muscular action was noticed by Thouvenel to occur with\nBleton a hundred years ago. On p. 59 of his Me'moire Thouvenel says\nthat, when Bleton placed his fingers on the hand of a person with whom\nthe baguette would not turn, then the rod instantly rotated when they\napproached an underground spring. M. le Comte de M , whom I\nquoted just now, states that, whilst the baguette would not move in\nhis hands, yet when Bleton held them the rod then began to turn,\nmuch to his astonishment. A few years later Amoretti indepen\ndently discovered the same thing when Pennet touched his hands. He\nstates the rod then turned against his (Amoretti's) will whenever he\nstood over veins of metal. I have referred to this on p. 247. Compare\nthis with the similar experience (only with a forked rod) described by\na mechanical engineer, Mr. Morton, given on p. 172 of the present\nReport, or with the precisely corresponding experience of an able\nlawyer (the land agent to Trinity College, Cambridge), Mr. Woolley,\ngiven on p. 278.\nThere can, therefore, be no doubt about this curious fact, which\nseems to occur most conspicuously only with notable dowsers, such as\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 293\nBleton and the late J. Mullins. What is the explanation of it? I\nexpect it will be found not in the transmission of any voluntary or\ninvoluntary motion from the sensitive to the insensitive person, but in\nthe transmission of a suggestion to the latter. If so, any mode of\nimpressing such a suggestion would do as well, if it be emphatic and\nindirect. The charming away of warts, of which we have such striking\nand well authenticated instances, is a case where any kind of indirect\nsuggestion will do, if it be strongly impressed on the recipient.1\nAnd by the word suggestion is meant, as Professor Pierre Janet\ndefines it, the influence which one person exercises upon another indepen\ndently of the voluntary consent of the subject.2 That is to say, certain\nindividuals will submit to a foreign influence and obey it, without\nhaving consented or intended to obey and without even knowing they\nwere obeying. Now the influence of suggestion is most strikingly seen\nin these involuntary or automatic phenomena, and cases analogous to\nthe apparent transmission of the motion of the baguette from one\nperson to another occur with the pendule and in the so-called wi\/ling\ngame. If one person, A, finds the pendule will not oscillate in his\nhands and another, B, finds it does oscillate freely with him, then\nwhen B clasps the free hand of A, the pendule now oscillates for A\nor the direction of the oscillation can be instantly changed by C\nclasping B's free hand, and again changed if D clasps C's other hand\nand so on through a large circle ; B, C, and D desiring the chango to\noccur. Again, in the \" willing game,\" I found in 1879 that\nThe intervention of a second person (who was ignorant of what had to be\ndone) between the willer and the subject, the hands of each resting on the\nshoulders of the one in front, did not seriously interfere with the result\nattained.3\nFurthermore, with a sensitive subject, if the operator or willer\nmerely placed three fingers lightly on the back of the subject's head,\nthe latter would write correctly words known only to the operator,\neven if Greek words and characters were used, though the subject\nknew nothing of Greek.4 Professor Janet gives a simpler case where\n1 See Journal S.P.R., Vol. VIII. (1897-98), pp. 7, -10, 96, etc., also an admirable\nwork by Miss Feilding on Faith-Sealing, Chaps. I. and IV. (Duckworth and Co.,\n1899). In hypnosis a direct suggestion appears effective, whereas in the normal state\nan indirect suggestion seems most potent. e.g., touching or stroking the warts, tying\na thread round the wrist, etc. But why is it that only some persons have this\nsuggestive power? la it the faith of the charmer in his remedy or the faith of the\npatient ? And why is faith, with its necessary self-surrender, the nexus between the\nconscious and the sub-conscious life? the powers of the latter being so miraculous,\nbecause so foreign to the former.\n1 UAutomatisuie Psychologinue, by Professor Pierre Janet, p. 140 ; see also Lea\nSuggestions Hypnotiques, by Professor Paul Janet.\nii Proceedings S.P.R., 1882, VoL I., p. 50.\n*Ibid., p. 51.\n\f294 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nthe operator holds the left hand of the subject and the latter with his\nright hand writes the words known only to the operator.1\nIf we admit telepathy, i.e., true thought-transference, as a vera\ncausa, no doubt it plays an important part in many of these phenomena\nof suggestion, and my original object in 1879, when making the experi\nments I have described, was to show that the theory of the transmission\nof an idea by involuntary muscular action had to be pushed to such a\ngrotesque extent that it became easier to believe in a purely mental,\nrather than in a muscular transmission of the suggestion made by the\noperator. Whichever view is taken, the important part played by\nsuggestion in all these phenomena is unquestionable, and it was to\nthis fact I drew the attention of psychologists, I believe for the\nfirst time, in a paper read before the British Association so long\nago as 1876.2\n\u00a7 5. Historical Note.\nIn concluding this part we should not forget that one of the first\nscientific men in this century who drew attention to the varied effects\nof involuntary muscular action was Chevreul. In his work on the\ndivining rod (La Baguette Divinatoire, Paris, 1854), Chevreul shows\nhow the rod may be moved in this way. The principle which Chevreul\nenunciates, and which he maintains accounts for many diverse phe\nnomena, is one with which we are now of course perfectly familiar ; he\nthus expresses it :\u2014\nLe deVeloppoment en nous d'une action musculaire qui n'est pas le\nproduit d'une volonte, mais le reaultat d'une pensee qui se porte sur un\nphenomene du monde exterieur, sans preoccupation de Taction musculaire\nindispensable a la manifestation du phenomene, va servir de centre de\nrailliement aux faits dissemines ; je le designerai par l'expression de principe\ndu pendnle cxplurateur.3\nTwenty-one years before the publication of his work on the\nBaguette, Chevreul had addressed a letter to the famous Ampere,\n(published in the Revue ties Dense Mondes for 1833) in which he\nclearly states that the movement of the pendule, which was exciting\nmuch attention at that time, was due to \" un mouvement musculaire\nde mon bras, quoique insensible pour moi \" and he points out the\nintimate connection between the will or intention of the operator and\nthe resultant movement of the little ring or ball suspended by a\nthread from his fingers. He thus clears away a mass of perplexing\nand misleading observations which had been published by numerous\n1 L'Automatisme Psychologique, p. 373. Paris, 1889.\n2 Printed in Prmedings S.P.R. for 1882, Vol. I., p. 240.\n3 Chevreul, La Baguette Divinatoire, p. 187.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 295\nprevious experimenters on the pendule, all of whom believed some\nintimate connection existed between the oscillation of the little ball\nand the electric state of the operator or of the object that was tested.1\nA German savant, Professor Gilbert, had before this shown in\nGilbert's Annalen der Physdk, Vols. 26 and 27, how worthless\nwere the inferences drawn from these experiments by Ritter,\nAmoretti, Gerboin and others ; Gilbert subsequently published his\npapers in 1808.2\nIn the numerous papers and books on the baguette and pendule pub\nlished on the Continent between 1796 and 1816, the controversy, often\nviolent in tone, does not turn upon the main question whether the\nso-called diviner or dowser could or could not discover underground\nwater better than ordinary mortals,\u2014for except in Thouvenel's original\nMe'moire, little or no evidence is adduced on this point\u2014but whether\n\"animal electricity \" was or was not the cause of the twisting of the\nrod. The disputants, as usual, cared less to know the actual facts than\nto prove their particular theory to be true. Moreover the attention of\nthe scientific world at the early part of the 19th century was directed\nto electricity by Volta and Galvani's discoveries, and it was natural\nthat many investigators should see in the sudden and mysterious\nmotion of the baguette and the pendule an effect analogous to the\nspasmodic contraction of the legs of a dead frog which Galvani had\nshown was due to an electric stimulus. In fact, Volta himself was\nconsulted and took part in some of these experiments with the\nbaguette, but his opinion is not stated.\nFrom the baguette and the pendule public attention was afterwards\ndirected to \"table-turning,\" and the illustrious Faraday, in 1854, con\nclusively proved by experiment that it was quite possible for the\nsitters to make tables gyrate by involuntary muscular action on their\npart.3 Chevreul refers to Faraday's experiments on p. 220 of his\n1 See, for example, Professor Gerboin's Rccherches Expcrimentales sur \u00abn noueeau\nmode de faction ikctrique, Strasbourg, 1808 ; or Ritter's and Amoretti's writings from\n1800 to 1807 on Der animalische electrometrie, die baguette, und der pcndel, forming\nthe subject of these papers.\n2 Kritische Aufsalzc Ubcr die in Miinchen wieder erneuten Versuche mit Schwefelkies-\nPendeln und Wunschelruthen, von L. W. Gilbert, Halle, 1808. I have to thank Miss\nE. Stokes for making an abstract for me at the British Museum of this and other old\nGerman and Italian works on the subject of the baguette and pendule.\n3 Faraday's explanation of table turning is undoubtedly a eera causa for a certain\nclass of so-called spiritualistic phenomena, but it is only applicable within a limited\nrange, as every investigator of spiritualism knows. It is of course not impossible\nthat some of the phenomena of the divining rod may, in like manner, be found to\ntranscend any explanation now recognised by science ; for the varied manifestations\nof automatism insensibly pass from the normal to the supernormal. At present,\nhowever, we are not, in my opinion, justified in assuming the motion of the rod to be\nexplicable by other than known causes.\n\f296 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nwork on the Baguette, and groups all these cognate phenomena under\none common explanation : the essential factors, according to both\nFaraday and Chevreul, being\u2014(1) the intention of the operator that\nthe movement should take place in a certain direction, and (2) that he\nshould be unaware he is exerting any effort of will, or any muscular\nforce, in carrying out his intention. Professor Ch. Richet has more\nrecently discussed the subject with wider knowledge, but I have not\nyet read his work.1 Dr. Li\u00e9beault2 takes much the same view as\nChevreul, but believes that the dowser, from gazing at the point\nof his rod, becomes partially hynotised, a view that I have also sug\ngested, but the hypnosis, if it exists, is certainly very slight in most\ndowsers.\nIn his masterly work, L'Automatisme Psycholoaique, Professor\nPierre Janet devotes a section to the consideration of the motion of\nthe divining rod. He confirms Chevreul's view as to the involuntary\nmotion of the rod and pendule, but he goes further and shows that\nthese automatic actions are \" 1\u00b0 sans le vouloir, et 2\u00b0 sans le savoir.\"\nChevreul admits the first, but asserts that the movements are due to\na conscious intention on the part of the operator to make the rod\nor pendulum move in a certain direction ; the knowledge and thought\nof the operator are, therefore, involved, though his will may not\nactively co-operate. Janet shows that this is a mistaken view; the\nmovement, as he rightly insists, takes place without the conscious\nintention of the operator. He remarks :\u2014\nM. Chevreul pousse aussi loin que possible l'explication des faits par la\ntendance au mouvement cr\u00e9ee par les images conscientes, mais quand les\nfaits depassent cette theorie, il retombe dans les explications banales par\nla fourberie et la simulation. ... II faut aller plus loin que M.\nChevreul et, apres avoir admis des actes sans volonte^ il faut parler des\npensees sans conscience [consciousness] ou en dehors de notre conscience.3\nChevreul, we see from the foregoing, was no exception to that\nfamiliar type of mind which fancies trickery or simulation afford the\nonly explanation of facts that lie beyond the range of its experience\nor its theories. In one of his conversations with Eckermann, Goethe\nshows how every new scientific truth has to encounter the fierce\nopposition of this class (see the motto on p. 132).4\nDr. Hodgson sends me, as this sheet was passing through the press,\na case (given in the foot-note on next page) he has received from an\n1 Des moueements incontcientes.

Janet calls les individus\nsuygestibles ; persons who are readily influenced by suggestion from\nwithin or without, whose mind is easily dominated by a single idea.\nThis may explain why it happens, as was noticed 150 years ago, that\nthe best dowsers are not educated people, but more or less ignorant\npersons, who\u2014 according to Pryce\u2014 {Mineralo'gia Cornubiensis, p. 118)\n\" hold the rod without puzzling their minds with doubts or reasonings.\"\nSuch persons best exhibit the \" reflex \" action to which the motion of the\nrod is due, the prompting of suggestion not being interfered with by\nvolition. But where will and reason are supreme, such automatic actions\nare brought into subjection by the intelligence. In other words, when\nour conscious self, which speaks through voluntary muscular movements,\nis dominant, the subconscious self is submerged. Hence in order that\nany subconscious suggestion may take effect in some form of automatic\naction, the reason and will must be in abeyance.\nIn fine, the controlling force of Suggestion is to the subconscious\nlife and its expression in involuntary 7tiuscular action and tissue-\nchange what the Will is to the conscious life and its expression in\nvoluntary muscular action.\nSummary.\nSumming up this lengthy discussion we see that the curious\nphenomena attending the motion of the so-called divining rod are\ncapable of explanation by causes known to science. They are not\nisolated phenomena, but belong to the large group which exhibit in\nvarious ways the play of motor automatism, and illustrate in a\nstriking manner the profound effect which suggestion has in deter\nmining, directing or modifying these phenomena.\n1 \"New Lebanon, N.Y., July 1st, 1900.

[part\nWhen some instrumental means is used to exhibit these involun\ntary muscular movements, it is desirable to employ a generic term,\nsuch as the word autoscope, as suggested in the previous Report. The\ndivining\u2014or dowsing\u2014rod is, therefore, a convenient out-of-door\nautoscope, and when held in a state of strain, as it often is, becomes,\nfrom its unstable or balanced equilibrium, very sensitive to almost\nimperceptible muscular action on the part of the dowser. (See, on this,\nProfessor de Mortillet's own observations, given on p. 244.)\nAs I said in the previous Report : It is just because these auto\nmatic actions appear to be so novel, and detached from ourselves,\nthat they are apt to be so misleading to some and so mischievous to\nothers. Interpreted on the one hand as the play of a wonderful occult\nforce, science has refused to have anything to do with phenomena\nwhich seem to obey no physical laws, but are capricious and self-\ndetermined. Interpreted on the other, truly enough, as the exhibition\nof a free and intelligent agent, some infernal or discarnate spirit has\nbeen fixed upon as the cause, and a fictitious authority for which there is\nno warrant has been given to tlieir indications. Whether in any case\nthese intelligent automatic movements exhibit information outside the\nmemory of the individual who uses the autoscope ; or a knowledge\nbeyond that which may have been unconsciously derived (a) from those\npresent by sign-reading or thought-transference, or (b) from the sur\nroundings of the automatist, by his hyperresthetic discernment of faint\nindications, is a problem which can only be solved so as to gain general\nacceptance by long and patient enquiry, of which our Proceedings\nare an earnest, and to which this monograph may afford a small\ncontribution.\nlatter took it merely in complaisance ; walked along a few rods ; suddenly it went\ndown. He couldn't stop it.

My man said he should want\nto see it before he believed it, the surface giving no indication of it. Thresher man\nwanted water for his boiler and dug.

As\na result of his work, he now has a small reservoir on the hillside back of his buildings,\nin a place where no water was known before, which supplies his barn the year round\nand affords a limited supply for use in case of fire. The reservoir is fed from two\nsmall springs discovered by the turning of the witch-hazel fork in his own hands.\nWhile with me he walked about over a good deal of territory. The fork turned\ndown every time be passed over a trickle of visible water, without exception. It\nalso turned several times where no water was visible or suggested. In two of these\nplaces I and a man with me dug down a few feet. In the one case we found a vein\nin the rock filled with iron pyrites crystals ; in the other we struck a sheet of solid\nslats rock about 30 in. down, which we had neither tools nor time to drill into\nor through : there is an old tradition of lead veins\u2014from which the Indians\nused to smelt out lead\u2014in the very place where his fork turned over the slate\nrock.\"\n\fxxxvm] On the So-called Divining Rod. 299\nPART XII.\nThe Malaise of the Dowser and its Orioin.\nNearly all dowsers assert that when the rod moves in their hands,\nor when they believe that underground water is beneath them, they\nexperience a peculiar sensation, which some describe as felt in the\nlimbs like the tingling of an electric shock, others as a shivering or\ntrembling, and others as an unpleasant sensation in the epigastric\nregion. With all there is more or less of a convulsive spasm, some\ntimes of a violent character. This malaise is very marked in some\ncases, but not experienced in others. That these physiological disturb\nances have a purely psychological origin is obvious\u2014(1) from the fact\nthat they are not experienced when the dowser is off duty, that is,\nwhen he has no suspicion that he is in the neighbourhood of under\nground water, and (2) that like effects are not produced by the much\ngreater masses of visible water in rivers, lakes, or the sea. The\ninteresting point is that these psycho-physiological phenomena have\na real existence ; they exist among dowsers in all countries, and can\nbe traced back, as historical investigation shows, for upwards of two\ncenturies. In the preceding Report I devoted an Appendix to this\nsubject, and to avoid repetition would beg those of my readers who\nare interested to refer to the cases I have there quoted.1\nLet us briefly note the principal facts. In the first place it is\nnot, as some imagine, only when the \"diviner\" is in the presence of\nunderground water that this physiological disturbance occurs. In the\nJournal des Scavans (Savants) for January, lo93, a copy of which I\npossess, a physician of some note, Dr. Chauvin, writes that, when the\nwell-known Jacques Aymar was sent for to trace, by means of his rod,\nthe murderer of a Lyons Marchand de Vin, Aymar was taken into\nthe cellar where the murder was committed ; suddenly his baguette\nmoved violently, and he was seized with convulsive spasms. Dr.\nChauvin, who was present, adds :\u2014\" II ne fut pas plutot entr\u00e9 qu'il se\nsentit tout emu, et que son poux s'eleva comme une grosse fievre.\"2\n1 Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 272, et seq.\n\u2022 Aymar, as my readers probably know, set out on the track of the murderer,\nwho had hitherto baffled all the attempts of the police to discover his whereabouts,\nand, guided by his baguette, tracked him \" for 45 hours on land and 30 hours on the\nwater,\" crossing and recrossing the Rhone, until at last he pointed out a man, found\nin a soldiers' camp, as the assassin. The man was arrested, taken to Lyons, tried,\nfound guilty, and subsequently confessing his crime, was put to death by being\nbroken at the wheel. There are numerous corroborative official depositions in this\nremarkable case ; among others is the prowl eerbal of an eye-witness, M. de Vagny,\nthe Procureur du Roi.\n\f300 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nA century later another distinguished French physician, Dr.\nThouvenel, independently notices much the same thing with the\nwater-finder, Bleton. Dr. Thouvenel gives a detailed medical report\nof his own long-continued observations, and states that when Bleton\nbelieved he was over a subterranean spring he was seized with an\nextraordinary malaise, which affected his diaphragm and produced a\nsense of oppression in the chest ; at the same time a shivering sets in\nand the pulse falls, his body trembles, and, in a word, he exhibits\n\"all the characteristics of an attack of convulsive spasm.\"1 Similar\nsymptoms manifested themselves in the Prior of a convent at Autun,\nwho was an amateur dowser and contemporary of Bleton. A few\nyears later the Italian savant, Amoretti, noticed the same symptoms\noccur whenever the lad Pennet came over a vein of mineral ore or of\ncoal. Amoretti states that a surgeon, Sanzio, an amateur dowser,\nfound his pulse accelerated twelve to fifteen beats per minute when\nthe rod moved in his hands (see p. 247).\nDr. Mayo, F.R.S., who, as Professor of Anatomy and Physiology\nin King's College and in the College of Surgeons in London, was a\nmost competent observer, describes corresponding symptoms which he\nobserved in 1847 in a youth in Russia. The lad had never seen a\n\"divining rod\" before, but when Dr. Mayo instructed him how to\nuse it, and made him walk over a spot where he had reason to believe\nan underground spring existed, the forked twig twisted round, much\nto the lad's astonishment, and at the same time Dr. Mayo states the\nlad declared that\nhe felt an uneasy sensation which quickly increased to pain at the pit of the\nstomach, and he became alarmed, so that I bade him quit hold of the rod,\nwhen the pain ceased. Ten minutes later I induced him to make another\ntrial ; the results were the same.2\nAs Dr. Mayo was apparently unaware of Thouvenel's writings, he\ncould hardly have anticipated or suggested the malaise experienced by\nhis subject, but the effect observed was doubtless due to the same\npsychological cause as in the previous cases.\nAbundant modern instances of a similar physiological disturbance\nand convulsive spasm occurring with various dowsers in different\ncountries will be found in the cases cited in the previous and present\nReport (see, e.g., pp. 230, 244, 245, 251, 252, etc.). Mr. J. F. Young,\nwhose experiences as an amateur dowser are given on p. 219, says :\u2014\nI have noticed, when divining, unpleasant and peculiar symptoms always\noccur when I am over an underground spring ; often a convulsive feeling and\nstaggering comes on.\n1 Mtmoirc Physique et Medicinal, p. 53 ; Paris, 1781. The passage is quoted in\nfull in the previous Report, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 272 and 273.\n2 Truths Contained in Popular Superstitions, p. 18 ; London 1S56.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 301\nHe goes on to describe how the sensation is chiefly felt at the\nepigastrium, and that his father, who was also an amateur dowser,\nused to stagger and vomit when the rod turned in his hands. An\nexperiment was once made with old Mr. Young to test whether these\nsymptoms were genuine ; it is described in detail in my previous\nReport, p. 276. Mr. Young was carefully blindfolded and led about\nby a circuitous route, but directly he came over the spot where he had\nbeen seized with these symptoms before, and which had been purposely\nmarked, \" he reeled as before and would have fallen if I had not held\nhim up. Directly he came off the place he was all right.\" The con\nvulsions that seized the famous dowser, Mr. Lawrence, whenever he\ncame to a place beneath which he asserted underground water to exist,\nhave been described on a previous page (foot-note, p. 290).\nThere are some sceptical friends who would explain these phe\nnomena by asserting that these different dowsers conspired to exhibit\nsimilar symptoms as a bit of stage business in order to impress the\nonlookers. It is, I think, unnecessary to waste time in disputing\nsuch a belief if any one cares to hold it.\nHow, then, are we to explain these curious pathological phe\nnomena? The facts are certainly incontestable and, I venture to think,\ndeserve more attention from physiologists than they have yet received.\nThey are not, however, peculiar to the use of the so-called divining\nrod, but are found to exist more or less conspicuously in other cases of\nmotor automatism. Professor Pierre Janet has drawn attention to\nvery similar convulsive phenomena and physiological disturbances as\nassociated with other phases of automatism.1 Prior to this, how\never, in the first volume of the Proceedings of our Society, I pointed\nout that in trials with the \" willing game,\"\u2014which is one phase of\nthese varied automatic phenomena, \u2014 curious physiological disturb\nances were often produced, such as dizziness, hysteria, and incipient\ntrance. 2 In fact, a malaise, manifesting itself in different ways, and\nwith different degrees of intensity in different subjects, is a usual con\ncomitant of motor automatism and its allied phenomena.\nThe singular connection of visceral sensation,\u2014a visceral con\nsciousness as it were,\u2014with a particular psychical state is familiar to\nus all in emotion3. Emotion, in fact, is afeeling excited by an idea or\ntrain of ideas, and therefore the sensations experienced by the dowser\n1 L'Automatismc P!iichologique, p. 208, etc. ; Paris, 188!).\n2 Proceedings S.P.R. for 1882, Vol. I., p. 57.\n3 Professor James holds that our feeling of the bodily changes as they recur is\nthe emotion ; he writes, \" If I were to become corporeally aniesthetic, I should be\nexcluded from the life of the affections, harsh and tender alike. ' ' Physiologically,\nmay we not really define emotion as certain visceral or vascular disturbances, set up\nby suggestion, the sensation of these disturbances being the feeling of emotion ?\n\f302 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nare strictly emotional disturbances. Whether emotion is primarily a\ncerebral process, as some physiologists maintain, the visceral or\nvascular disturbance being secondary ; or whether, as other eminent\nphysiologists hold, the psychical process of emotion is secondary to the\nexcitation of the visceral organs,\u2014through certain stimuli causing the\ndischarge of a nervous impulse into those organs,\u2014 is a matter that\ndoes not concern us here, albeit physiologists may find in the facts I\nhave cited some fresh light thrown on this controversy. The point of\ninterest to us is that (1) the malaise or other sensation felt by the\ndowser is probably an emotional effect, and (2) the fresh evidence\nafforded of the nexus existing between emotion and muscular action,\nwhether this latter be conscious or, as with the dowser and his rod,\nunconscious. As Professor Sherrington, F.R.S., an able physiologist,\nin a recent paper on Emotion (Nature, Vol. 62, p. 331), has said : \u2014\" It\nwould be consonant with what we know of reflex action if the spur\nthat started the muscular expression should simultaneously and of itself\ninitiate also the visceral adjunct reaction.\"\nFurthermore, in many cases where subconscious acts are performed,\nas M. Janet points out, a state of partial catalepsy supervenes.\nCatalepsy, as Dr. Ochorowicz has shown, is a state of mono-ideism,1\nthat is, a \"mental condition which concentrates every action upon\none single and dominant idea and is not counterbalanced by any\nother.\" Now this is precisely the condition of the dowser when he\n\"sets\" himself to dowse, and in some cases he passes into a state of\ncomplete catalepsy when the idea culminates. It is not, therefore, a\nquestion of underground water or mineral ore, but merely the result\nof suggestion acting upon a state of mono-ideism.\nThe malaise, or other sensation felt by the dowser, is, therefore, in\nall probability, an emotional disturbance, the mind being dominated by\na single idea and the subject being a person on whom suggestion is\noperative : using the word \" suggestion \" in the sense which I have\nalready defined as an impression or influence exercised without the\nknowledge or consent of the subject being concerned.\nWe have now narrowed the issue down to the problem of \" how does\nthis subconscious suggestion arise in the case of the successful\ndowser 1 \" Here we enter upon the final stage of our inquiry.\n1 La Sui\/i\/estion Mentale, p. 112 ; Paris, 1887.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 303\nPART XIII.\nOrigin of the Stimulus that gives rise to the Motor Automatism\nop the Dowser.\n\u00a7 1. Is it Derived through the Ordinary Channels of Sense?\nIt now remains for us to try and ascertain what gives rise to the\nsuggestion or stimulus which causes the involuntary motion of the rod\n\u2014in other words, what is it originates the motor automatism of the\ndowser? What is it \"pulls the trigger\"? Evidently this suggestion\nor stimulus cannot be purely accidental and worthless, for, as we have\nseen, the operations of a good dowser are attended with unquestion\nable success, a success far beyond that which mere chance coincidence\ncan account for. This being conceded, we now turn to the possible\nexplanations already stated at the beginning (p. 143).\n(i.) Is this success due merely to knowledge acquired by the dowser\nfrom experience and observation of the ground and perhaps occasional\nhints from bystanders ? In that case success would be arrived at by\nan exercise of judgment, or some would say cunning ; shrewd observa\ntion and the piecing together of stray information would be the main\nbusiness of the dowser. Under these circumstances sub-conscious\nsuggestion and motor automatism are wholly out of the question\u2014the\nmotion of the rod must be a purely voluntary act ; and if so the\nforked twig of the dowser, like the wand of the conjuror, becomes a\npiece of stage property, or of charlatanry, to mystify the public. This\nhas hitherto been the usual scientific view, but it is, I maintain, now\nproved to be untenable ; the motion of the rod is unquestionably, as\nProfessor Janet has said, \"sans le vouloir et sans le savoir\" on the part\nof the dowser. It is quite possible the experience gained by the dowser,\nor any observations he has made on the spot, may be of service to\nhim, but if so, it must lie at the background of his consciousness and\nnot form part of a process of reasoning. We are thus driven to\ninquire :\u2014\n(ii.) Is this information or suggestion derivedfrom some sub-conscious\nprocess ofobservation on the part of the dowser, or hyperteslhetic discern\nment ofsurface signs too faint or complex to be perceived by the ordinary\nobserver ? There is much to be said on behalf of this view, for surface\nsigns of underground water do exist and for shallow wells such signs\nare of great value independently of geological knowledge. On p. 248\nof the previous Report, I pointed out the nature of some of these signs,\nand since that Report was published, an excellent little Manual on the\ndiscovery of water-sources has been published in France, wherein the\n\f304 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nsurface indications of underground water are very clearly set forth.1\nMuch of this knowledge goes back to ancient times. Vitruvius,\nAugustus Caesar's famous engineer, gives a lengthy account of surface\nsigns which were employed in his day to find underground water :\nsome appear fanciful, but many are still in use. Pliny, in his Natural\nHistory, refers to the same thing. Moreover, the letters of Cassiodorus\n(the statesman and secretary of Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths),\nwritten at the beginning of the sixth century, show that in his time\nthere were certain people held in high repute, and called \" Aquilegi,\"\nwho appear to have been professional water-finders. Cassiodorus\nexplains how this valuable art had arisen from careful observation of\nthe surface of the ground, etc.2 Now the modern dowser may more\nor less unconsciously note these indications and,\u2014without being able to\ngive any rational explanation of how it comes about, \u2014 the impressions\nmade upon him by these surface signs may create the sub-conscious\nsuggestion which causes the involuntary motion of the rod.\nThe extraordinary success of the Abbe- Paramelle as a water-finder,\nor \" hydroscope \" as he was called, supports this view. Paramelle tells\nus he was guided entirely by the knowledge he had acquired from a\ncareful study of the surface of the ground, and to defend himself from\nthe attacks made upon him, he wrote a treatise to put on record the\nmethods he employed. As this work appears almost wholly unknown\nin England, I have given an outline of it in Appendix D, see p. 352 ;\nto this I would refer my readers. But the rapidity and certainty\nwith which Paramelle is stated, on trustworthy evidence, to have\nlocated the site, probable depth and volume of water in wells under\n50 feet deep, can hardly be accounted for by an exercise of ordinary\nconscious observation and judgment. It is much more like an act of\nintuition, for between 1839 and 1854 he had located 10,000 sources\nof underground water and his failures appear to have been only from\n5 to 10 per cent, of the whole. Though Paramelle believed he could\nteach his system, his pupils did not achieve their master's success and\nthe school he hoped to found died out. On the whole, there can, I\nthink, be little doubt that the French AbW arrived at his conclusions\nsub-consciously, though he employed no rod to give automatic\nexpression to his instinctive opinion.\nBut it is not only in water-finding that the trained scientific\nobserver, such as a field geologist, is often less successful in reading\nsurface indications than those who appear possessed of some instinctive\ndiscernment of the signs sought for. Thus, in the discovery of china\n1 I have given a brief notice of this little book by M. Auscher on p. 382 of the\npresent Report.\n> See Appendix F.. p. 370.\n\fxxxvm ] On the So-called Divining Rod. 305\nclay (the basis of our best English china), I am informed by a high\nauthority, Mr. Fred. W. P. Jago, that :\u2014\nThe workmen in the china-clay district (near St. Austell, in Cornwall)\nwill point out where a bed of china clay in its natural state of decomposed\ngranite lies hidden under what they term the slad. [Mr. Jago goes on\nto say] : As my father and myself have been engaged in this kind of mining\nfor nearly seventy years, I also could fairly point out where there was a bed\nof china clay below the surface, but I would defy the scientific geologist to do\nso from his inspection.\nYet our workmen will even tell you the extent of such a bed\u2014from their\nknowledge of the peculiar formation of the surface of the ground\u2014before an\natom of the clay has been seen or dug up from, say 8 or 10 feet below. The\nterm slad expresses this, but it is as hard to describe as it would be for one\nto describe his own handwriting.\nI have always suspected that dowsers have a somewhat similar knowledge\nas to water and lodes.\nFeed. W. P. Jago.\nHere then we have a case where success can hardly be due to any\nconscious process of reasoning ; the judgment seems to be more or less\ninstinctive, though doubtless it has been gained by experience. Much\nthe same thing occurs in the location of metallic lodes. From very\nearly times, the signs of underground ore have been noticed by miners,\nreferences to these indications are to be found in all the leading works\non mining published in the 16th and 17th centuries.1 A distinguished\nauthority on mining, the late Professor Warington Smyth, F.R.S.,\nremarked in a lecture delivered in 1869 :\u2014\nThere is some foundation for the idea that metallic lodes affect vegetation ;\nthe herbage is often brighter and better over certain lodes and worse over\nothers. A certain class of plants will grow over the lode and not on adjacent\nparts. Veins containing decomposing iron pyrites are slightly warmer, so\nthat there is rather a higher temperature over them ; dow or hoar frost will\nnot lie long on the lode, so that its presence can be traced early in the\nmorning. A peculiar odour from the sulphurous gases pervades the direction\nof a lode, and sometimes at night a faintly luminous appearance is seen over\ncertain metallic lodes.2\nAs we shall see in Book III., the dowser has gained remarkable\nsuccess not only in finding underground water but mineral lodes, and\nhence the probability that he is guided by some surface indications is\ngreatly increased from the fact that such indications are found in both\nthese cases. It may, however, be urged that ordinary observation and\njudgment would be sufficient in each case to explain success without\nassuming any instinctive or subconscious process. But this view, as\n1 See especially G. Agricola's De Re Mctallica, Basle, 1546.\n* Similar statements will also be found in the 9th Edition of the Encyc. Brit.,\nunder the article \" Mining.\" See also Pryce's Mincralogia Cornubientis, etc.\nz\n\f306 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nwe have seen, is inconsistent with the phenomenon of motor auto\nmatism, and, moreover, common sense, aided by observation, knowledge\nand reasoning, would long ago have displaced the dowser had the\nLatter not been found to be of greater practical value.\nIt must, therefore, be admitted that if surface indications deter\nmine the suggestion that starts the automatic motion of the rod, these\nindications are not deliberately sought for, but that a subconscious\nand hypercsthetic discernment of faint signs that escape the ordinary\nobserver is quite possible on the part of the successful dowser.\nMany instances have been given in our Proceedings of definite\nmotor reactions, sometimes of a remarkable character quite unaccom\npanied by consciousness,1 and many illustrations have also been given\nof what at first sight appears an almost miraculous sense of perception,\nreally due to a transitory hyperaesthetic and subconscious condition on\nthe part of the subject.- It is, therefore, I think, unnecessary for me\nto contend further that the foregoing explanation is really a vera causa,\nbut I now proceed to show that it is not the whole cause and may really\nplay a very unimportant part in the matter.\n\u00a7 2. Is the Suggestion Pure Chance or Derived from some Super\nnormal Source of Perception ?\nWhilst the explanation just given may cover some of the facts, it\nfails to explain those cases where surface indications of underground\nwater do not exist, owing either to the surface being made ground or\ncovered with buildings, or with a layer of 30 or 40 feet of \" drift,\" or\nthe water itself existing in fissures or cavities so far beneath the surface\nthat it is inconceivable its presence could be indicated by any super\nficial signs. Now, an attentive study of the cases I have cited in the\npresent and the previous Report shows that the dowser's success is not\nlimited to localities where surface indications may be conjectured.\nTake, for example, the classical case of Waterford, so fully described\nand discussed in the previous Report, pp. 106-117. The able geologists\nwho have examined that case clearly show that surface signs could\nhave nothing to say to the dowser's success. Take again in the\n1 Experiments in \"normal motor automatism \" form the subject of an interesting\npaper published in 1896 among the \"'Studies from the Psychological Laboratory of\nHarvard University.\"\n- See Professor Guebhard's experiences, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 411, and\nmany similar illustrations cited by Mr. Myers in his papers on the \"Subliminal Self \"\npublished in our Proceeding!. I wonder the divining rod has never been used for\nweather prognostication. If a code could be arranged so as to interpret its indications,\nI have no doubt it would become as famous in foretelling the weather, say twelve\nhours ahead, as in finding underground water or mineral ores ; supposing that a sub\nconscious discernment of faint signs really occurs with the dowser. Leeches used to\nbe employed as weather prophets : see on this subject of animal presentiments my\nlast Report, Proccedhv\/s S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 2,r\u00bb0.\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-culled Divining Rod. 307\npresent Report the Errol case, p. 171, when the same dowser (the late\nJohn Mullins) was employed, or the Lytes-Cary case, p. 174, or the\nCarrigoona experiments, p. 144, or the Shanklin experiments, p. 164, or\nthe case of Beraz, p. 248, or many of Bleton's cases, p. 264, or others\nI might quote. All these cases point to one of two conclusions \u2014\neither they are the result of chance coincidence, lucky hits on the part\nof the dowser, or that the dowser possesses some faculty new to science.\nLet us take the first alternative. What are the chances of success\nin, say the Waterford case ? Here the geologists show that Mullins\nmust have hit upon a line of fault in the Silurian rocks \" 80 ft. below\nthe surface,\" or \" a porous stratum concealed beneath the drift,\"\n\u2014which is here over 40 ft. in thickness (see the Report by Mr. J. R.\nKilroe of the Geological Survey of Ireland, given in my former\nReport, Proceedings S.P.R.,Vol. XIII., p. 116). Now before the advent\nof Mullins three borings (iii one case to the depth of 1,000 ft., in\nanother to a depth of 392 ft.) had been made on scientific advice in\nplaces near the spot selected by Mullins ; one of these borings had\nbeen made on the advice of Mr. Kinahan, F.G.S., of the Geological\nSurvey, and yet in each case no water had been found. The chances\nof hitting a line of fault or porous stratum were, therefore, extremely\nsmall. I have talked over this with Mr. Kilroe, who has visited the\nspot and is one of the best geological authorities on that district, and\nhe tells mo that a \" lucky fluke \" on the part of the dowser, though\nconceivable, is almost incredible. This also was evidently the opinion\nof the local geologist, Mr. Budd, who was present at the borings, and\nof Mr. Kinahan himself. Moreover, Mullins predicted the exact\ndepth of the fissure within a foot or two and was right in the volume\nof water that was found. These are contemporary statements made\nby those who were at first prejudiced against the dowser.\nFrom the study of these and other cases I have therefore been\ndriven to the conclusion that neither surface signs, nor hypera.sthetic\ndiscernment, nor chance coincidence, can account for all the successes\nof a good dowser like Bleton in the last century or the late J. Mullins\nand others in recent times. This is precisely the conclusion which Mr.\nWestlake, F.G.S., has independently arrived at from a careful geological\nexamination on the spot of other cases selected from my previous\nReport, see Appendix A., p. 337. In his analysis, Mr. Westlake assumes\nthe dowser knew all the local indications of the underground water, and\nhe is disposed to read back into the dowser's mind the hydro-geological\nknowledge which was gained after the dowser's well had been sunk.\nNotwithstanding all this, Mr. Westlake concludes that a certain\npercentage of cases (10 to 15 per cent.) defy any explanation known to\nscience except chance coincidence. Here then the issue is knit. Can\nit be shown that the outstanding cases are explicable as merely lucky\n\f308 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nhits due to pure chance on the part of the dowser ? I think the\nonus probandi of this must be left to those who challenge our methods\nof inquiry, or deny the existence of any avenue of knowledge other\nthan the recognised channels of sense.\n\u00a7 3. Is any Physical Cause at all Likely ?\nIn seeking for an explanation of these outstanding cases, I do not\nthink we need consider any physical cause. Recent scientific discoveries,\nsuch as the X-rays and wireless telegraphy, have made the public\nfamiliar with the fact that bodies like earth and bricks and flesh, which\nare opaque to light, may be transparent to electric waves. But\nthough the penetration of opaque bodies by invisible radiation has\nlong been known to scientific men, the unscientific mind naturally seizes\nthe idea that just as electric waves have been shown to pass unimpeded\nthrough walls and mountains, so some electric influence from under\nground water is likely to pass through the superincumbent earth and\naffect the dowser. But then we must assume an electric influence also\nproceeds from mineral ores and that the dowser is a delicate electroscope,\nand this is pure assumption. It is true our knowledge of the world\naround is very limited, but 200 years ago the philosopher Malebranche\nshowed, from the uniformity of nature, how untenable was any\nexplanation based upon an imaginary physical influence produced by\nunderground water or metals upon the dowser.1 Whatever effect is\nproduced by underground water or ore would be produced in a greater\ndegree by the proximity of water or ore on the surface. Nevertheless,\nthe dowser appears quite insensible to the mass of water in a river,\nlake, or the ocean, or to masses of metal or ore within his sight.\nThere is, however, another physical hypothesis which is more\nplausible, and which at one time suggested itself to me. We are\ninsensible to certain physical forces which are ever streaming through\nus, such as the magnetism of the earth ; we are likewise insensible to\nthe motion of the earth in space, but we should become alarmingly\nsensible of the latter if it were interrupted or suddenly changed. It\nis conceivable the dowser may be a person gifted with a sense affected\nby any slight interruption in the continuity or modification of the\nlines of terrestrial, magnetic, or electric force. Underground fissures\nmay be imagined to produce such a modification or want of continuity\nin the ambient field of force, and thus their presence might be\ndetected by certain organisations. But I do not attach the least\nvalue to this conception as an explanation of the success of the\n1 See \" Reponse de l'auteur ' De la recherche de la VeVite ' \" to Father Le Brun,\npublished in the Ltltro qui dicoiivrent I'illution del philosophe! tur la baguctU, p. 9,\net seq. Paris, 1693.\n\fxxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 309\ndowser ; for, inter alia, there is no evidence to show that the dowser\nis more affected than ordinary persons by any of the physical forces ;\nand the interruption of a magnetic field of force enormously greater\nthan that due to the earth is absolutely unfelt by the dowser. No,\nthe key to the mystery that remains must, in my opinion, be sought in\nthe psychical and not in the physical world.\n\u00a7 4. Probable Explanation of the More Remarkable Successes\nof the Dowser.\nThere is abundant evidence in our Proceedings that the information\nsubconsciously given by some automatists often transcends the ordinary\nsense perceptions. Cases of so-called clairvoyanca resting upon excellent\ntestimony are known, see e.g., the cases cited in Mrs. Sidgwick's paper\non the \" Evidence for Clairvoyance,\" or Dr. Alfred Backman's \" Experi\nments on Clairvoyance,\" and the supplementary papers to both of\nthese contained in Vol. IX. of the Proceedings S.P.R., also the\nevidence cited by Mr. Myers in Vol. XI., pp. 367-404. It is true the\nscience of to-day does not recognise any such super-sensory extension\nof knowledge, yet nothing is clearer to those who have made a careful\nand critical study of psychical phenomena, not only that telepathy is a\nfact, but that to the subconscious or subliminal self, the elements of\ntime and space have not the same limitations as they have to our\nconscious self. Even Schopenhauer, in his Versucht iiber Geistersehen,\nlong ago said, \" He who doubts the fact of clairvoyance is not sceptical\nbut ignorant.\" This is, perhaps, a stronger assertion than I should\nbe disposed to make, but of the reality of this \" far seeing \" power, I,\namong others, have had indubitable proof after carefully conducted\nexperiments with persons in the deep hypnotic state, and the same\ncondition is often seen in the allied state of somnambulism. Those\nwho on a priori grounds deny the possibility of any such transcen\ndental perceptive power should read the conclusions unanimously\narrived at by the nine distinguished members of the French Royal\nAcademy of Medicine, who were appointed by the Academy to report\non mesmeric phenomena. After five years' investigation this Com\nmittee presented their lengthy Report to the Academy in June, 1831.\nThey state they began the inquiry with \" inexperience, impatience\nand distrust,\" which at first militated against them. Ultimately,\nafter the most rigorous tests, they \" conclude with certainty \" that\nthe faculty which has been designated clairvoyance does really exist\nin certain subjects in the mesmeric state.1\n1 See Colquhoun's translation of this Report published in 1833. In an Appendix\nthe Editor gives several remarkable cases of clairvoyance, attested by some eminent\nContinental physicians as occurring in certain cataleptic patients, who\u2014like the\ndowser\u2014appeared to have the seat of this perceptive faculty in the epigastrium.\n\f310 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nThe question arises, Is this condition ever found in persons\nwho, like the dowser, are in their normal waking state, not in a\nhypnotic or somnambulic trance 1 I have tried to put this ques\ntion to the test of experiment with an amateur dowser, and the\nresult of the preliminary experiments (which are all that have so\nfar been made), affords considerable support to the hypothesis of\nsome kind of clairvoyant faculty in the particular dowser tested.\nI have given an account of these experiments, together with some\nadditional evidence bearing on the same subject, in Appendix E.,\np. 359.1\nProfessor Janet, in a passage I have quoted on p. 297, points\nout that evidence of a secondary personality is afforded in cases of\nmotor automatism such as the dowser exhibits. Now, we know\nthat in automatic writing the secondary self frequently exhibits\ntranscendental sources of information ; the Ego seems to pass beyond\nits usual narrow threshold of sensibility, the veil is lifted which\nhides scenes spatially distant.2 Mr. Myers has cited cases of\nwhat he terms cosmopathie impressibility on the part of the\nautomatist ; that is, transcendental impressions which come to men\nfrom the surrounding world, impressions \"borne like seed on the wind,\nrather than wittingly directed towards him by the voluntary or\ninvoluntary sympathy of any assignable intelligence.\"3 The sensibility\nof the dowser may be of such a kind, but humbler, geopathic and not\ncosmopathie. I have no doubt, however, that in years to come we\nshall see in all these phenomena the manifestation of the transcendental\nSubject which lies in the background of our being, and remains\nunrevealed to our self-consciousness. Thus we have been led from the\nstudy of such a matter-of-fact and practical question as the discovery\nof underground water by the dowser to the very centre and mystery\nof our complex personality.\nHere, however, we do well to remember that there is but a step\nfrom the sublime to the ridiculous. For the emergence of the\nsubconscious self and its expression in some form of motor automatism\ninvolves the more or less complete surrender of our reason, of self-\nconsciousness and the voluntary control over our actions ; the reins\nof will are, as it were, thrown down and the automatist becomes the\n1 A belief in the existence of clairvoyance among certain persons in the normal\nstate is, I find, the foundation of the repute in which the so-called Zahoris were once\nheld.

For my own part, I am disposed to think that\nthis last cause, though less acceptable to science, will ultimately be\nfound to be the truer explanation of the more striking successes of a\ngood dowser.2 My reasons for thinking so are : (i) the success which\ncertain dowsers have achieved in discovering underground water, when\nsurface indications were out of the question, and when previous\nborings, as deep or deeper, in the immediate vicinity failed to discover\nwater ; (ii) the success which has attended young or ignorant dowsers,\nsuch as Bleton, who cannot be supposed to have an intuitive knowledge\nof the surface indications of underground water ; and (iii) the evidence\nafforded by carefully blindfolding the dowser.\nThe only alternative explanation in these cases appears to me\nto be that of chance coincidence, and to the majority of thoughtful\npersons this will doubtless seem the more probable alternative ; but\nthe probability of its being so will be recognised as extremely small by\nthose who will take the trouble to apply, so far as can be done, the\ndoctrine of chances to the facts I have cited. On the other hand, the\nprobability that an explanation is to be found in some extension of\nour knowledge of human personality, something new to science, and\nsomething akin to what has been termed clairvoyance, gains consider\nable weight from a critical study of cognate phenomena described in\nour Proceedings and elsewhere. And surely, even if the majority of\n1 It is obvious that such persons cannot be as fully responsible for their actions\nas the rest of mankind. Readily influenced by their environment and controlled by\nsuggestion, such \" suggestible persons \" (among whom are all so-called \"mediums\")\nwhen met with suspicion and the suggestion of fraud, frequently exhibit the very\ncharacteristics their critics have imagined them to possess. The investigators, in\nfact, have unconsciously suggested the rile that the subjects have played.\n2 If this be the case, the dowser ought to be able to indicate the position of any\nburied object, as well as underground water and mineral lodes, albeit surface indica\ntions in these latter may count for something. I have dealt with this wider question\nin Appendix E., p. 359.\n\f312 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\ncases of the success of the dowser are explicable by known causes, yet,\nas Kant said of the attested story of Swedenborg's clairvoyance, \" the\namazing inferences that would have to be drawn if only one such\nevent could be proved \" will, I hope, stimulate further inquiry, so\nthat the conclusion I have reached may be confirmed or disproved.\nI do not for one moment profess that the explanation I have sug\ngested is anything more than a provisional and tentative one. A final\nsolution is not likely to be reached until the subject has been critically\nexamined and discussed by scientific men from different points of view.\nBut if many years' experimental investigation gives me any right\nto express an opinion, I am convinced that the only method by which\nwe can hope to bring these elusive and perplexing phenomena out of\nthe \" disorderly mystery of ignorance,\" in which they have lain\nneglected for so long, into the \" orderly mystery of science,\" is by a\ncareful collection of trustworthy evidence, supplemented by experi\nmental investigation wherever it is possible, and then by the fearless\nsuggestion of some working hypothesis which will enable future in\nvestigators to direct their inquiries to definite issue, and thus\noverthrow or establish the provisional explanation that has been\nsuggested. This is obviously the method by which the whole edifice\nof modern science has been reared ; it is nothing more than the\napplication of the inductive philosophy to psychical research And\nwe may confidently expect much more rapid progress in this difficult\nregion of inquiry when it becomes evident that there is not only\nsomething to investigate, but that some solid addition to our know\nledge or some useful practical result will issue from the inquiry. A\nlarger number of trained investigators will then be attracted, and\nthough psychical research can never offer the commercial stimulus\nto which the recent development of electrical science is almost\nwholly due, yet it presents to us many problems of profound\ninterest.\nFor thirty years those of us who founded this Society have striven\nto ascertain whether the information derived through the recognised\nchannels of sense embraced the whole of the accessible sources of\nknowledge ; whether also the normal phenomena of Nature,\u2014manifested\nto us as the accidents of time, space, and mass, in terms of which all\nnatural phenomena may be expressed, \u2014were really the bed-rock upon\nwhich the whole superstructure of human science must be raised ; or\nwhether the order of Nature can be proved to contain an even vaster\nprocession of phenomena than is now embraced within the recognised\nlimits of science : in fine, whether we could ever reach by scientific\nmethods the profounder, more enduring, and transcendent realities\nthat lie beneath the material surface, as thought lies behind its\nutterance in language.\n\fxxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 313\nThere are some avenues of approach to this great quest which seem\nbarred to many earnest searchers after truth ; the limitation of our\nfaculties may possibly render certain pathways to knowledge inaccess\nible under the conditions of our present existence. But we cannot,\no priori, condemn any inquiry unless it has been conclusively proved\nto be phantasmal and worthless, issuing in a dreary and fatal waste\nof human effort, or beset with intellectual and moral confusion to\nthose who engage in it. Such warnings can hardly be said to apply\nto the present investigation. And if the outcome of our inquiry only\nestablishes the fact that what appeared supernormal and transcen\ndental is, after all, explicable by an extension of known perceptive\npowers, even then our time will not have been wasted, for we shall\nhave enlarged our knowledge of human faculty and human usefulness.\nFor my own part, I have been driven to believe that some dowsers\u2014\n' ' Whose exterior semblance doth belie\nThe Soul's immensity \"\nnevertheless give us a glimpse of\u2014\n\" The eternal deep\nHaunted for ever by the eternal mind.\"\nConclusion.\n(1) For some centuries past certain individuals locally known as\ndowsers have declared that they can discover the presence of under\nground water, mineral lodes, coal,1 building stone,2 or other buried\nobjects which may be sought for by the apparently spontaneous\nmotion of the so-called divining rod; when their pretensions have\nbeen tested, the result, though by no means uniformly in their favour,\nhas been so remarkable that chance coincidence appears a wholly\ninadequate explanation.\n(2) Any explanation based upon trickery or unconscious hints from\nbystanders, or the detection of faint surface indications of the con\ncealed object, or other known cause is insufficient to cover all the facts.\n(3) The movement of the rod or forked twig is only a special case\nof motor automatism exhibited by a large number of individuals,3\n1 Both Pennet and Bleton were tested for this a century ago, and several\ncompetent witnesses were convinced of the fact.\n* See, for example, the full and excellent narrative of a Belgian dowser, given by\nProfessor D' Outrcpoint, translated by Mr. Bennett, Assistant-Secretary of the\nS.P.E., and published in the Journal of the S.P.R. for June, 1899.\n8 A century ago Professor Sementini estimated that 80 per cent, of Italians could\n\"work \" the rod, but Amoretti thinks this number excessive ; he gives 20 per cent.\nMy own impression is that Amoretti is not far wrong. In England, perhaps, cne\nor two in every dozen persons would be found susceptible.\n\f314 Professor \\V. F. Barrett. [part\nand arises from a subconscious and involuntary \" suggestion \" im\npressed on the mind of the dowser.\n(4) Accompanying the involuntary and usually unconscious mus\ncular contraction which causes the motion of the forked twig or rod,\nmany dowsers experience a peculiar malaise and some a violent\nconvulsive spasm. This is a psycho-physiological effect, akin to\nemotion. Moreover, the state of mono-ideism of the dowser creates\na condition of partial catalepsy when some suggestion causes the idea\nto culminate.\n(5) This subconscious suggestion may arise from a variety of\ncauses ; sometimes it is merely an auto-suggestion, at others it is\nunconsciously derived through the senses from the environment, but\nin a certain number of those who exhibit motor automatism the sug\ngestion appears to be due to some kind of transcendental perceptive\npower.\n(6) Such persons appear only able to exercise this transcendental\nfaculty when their normal self-consciousness is more or less in abey\nance, or when it is completely submerged, as in profound hypnosis.\n(7) This subconscious perceptive power, commonly called \"clair\nvoyance,\" may provisionally be taken as the explanation of those\nsuccesses of the dowser which are inexplicable on any grounds at\npresent known to science.\nI wish to add a word of hearty thanks to the Editor of our\nProceedings, Miss Johnson, for the kind assistance she has rendered\nin the reading of the proofs of this paper and for many useful\nsuggestions.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A. 315\nAPPENDIX A.\nREPORT ON SOME CASES OF WATER - FINDING BY THE\nDIVINING ROD.\nBy E. Westlake, F.G.S.\nDuring the printing of Professor Barrett's paper published in\nJuly, 1897, I made an analysis of his cases, and selected forty in which\nit was stated that, prior to the dowser's success, a deeper but\nunsuccessful well or boring had been made in the immediate\nneighbourhood. These are cited, at the foot of page 2-52 of his paper,\nas offering presumptive evidence of something in dowsing beyond\nchance or experience. As it seemed desirable they should be looked\ninto from a geological point of view, I have since undertaken, at\nProfessor Barrett's request, an examination of twenty-one of them, i.e.,\nof seventeen published in his paper (Nos. 9, 17, 24, 26, 27, 286,\n42, 43, 47, 48, 57, 60, 77, 90, 99, 105, and 121),1 and of four others\nsubsequently received. Beyond aiding in their understanding, I soon\nfound that geology had little to do with the matter ; the dowser\ndoes not profess, and probably seldom has, a knowledge of it ; his\nconclusions seem usually drawn from more obvious considerations.\nIn psychological experiments, essentially modifiable by suggestion,\nit is absolutely necessary to have the conditions, if not under control,\nat any rate precisely recorded ; if they are not, it is impossible to\narrive at certain results. An observer coming after the event must\nallow that the dowser may have seen, or heard of, the position of\nneighbouring water, and have drawn his conclusions accordingly. -\nThis I have done throughout the paper, with the result, it may be,\nof minimising marvels that really exist : if so, it will only need\nexperiments more precisely noted to lead to their establishment.\nOf the twenty-one cases I examined, five were in the South and\nsixteen in the West of England ; seventeen similar cases in the North\nand East I was unable to visit. Those in the Isle of Wight I saw in\nNovember, 1897; those in Surrey and Sussex in June, 1898, and\nthose in the Wrest of England in May, 1899. I have arranged them,\naccording to evidential considerations, in the following groups,\n1 These numbers refer to the numbering of the cases given in Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., Part XXXII.\n- As a matter of fact, dowsers do not, as a rule, seek for information about the\nlocal water supply ; they believe so firmly in their \" gift,\" that they trust implicitly\nto the twisting of the hazel twig to guide them. Merryweather is the only dowser of\nwhom I have heard that looks for surface indications of underground water.\u2014\nW.F.B.\n\f316 Professor W. F. Barrett.

Sodbury.\u2014The Rev. R. S. Nash, of Old Sod bury\nVicarage, writes that in 1853, the date of the publication of Phippen's\nbook, the Rev. Mr. Foster was rector of Dodington, about one mile\nS.W. of Sodbury. The Rev. J. A. James, the present rector, informs\nme that there are three wells on the premises, the deepest of which is\nabout 60 feet. The water in it stands two or three feet from the\nsurface, and has never been lowered to 20 feet even in two exception\nally dry summers, so that nothing is now known about the alleged\ntunnel. The strata are Lower Lias, as in the celebrated case at\nShepton Mallet Station (Group (e), No. 60), to which this is, therefore,\nclosely parallel.\nNo. 26. Shepton Mallet Gaol. \u2014I am informed by a warder, Mr.\nJ. G. Barnes, that all the wells at the prison are filled up ; but the\nstrata being Lower Lias, and only a quarter of a mile west of the well\nin No. 60, the geological conditions are doubtless similar.\n1 Tho term \"old well\" designates the deeper, but unsuccessful, well sunk prior\nto the dowser's.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A 317\nNo. 48. Well at Mr. Samuel Lang's Kennels, Bristol.\u2014Inquiries in\nBristol elicited that Mr. Lang had not been heard of for some years.\nProfessor Lloyd Morgan, F.R.S., tells me that the kennels were at\nthe further end of Cold Harbour Lane, Redland, on Lower Lias or\nRhaetic, so that we have here another case of a tunnelled well in this\nformation. Seven out of the eighteen cases which follow were also in\nLower Lias, which thus appears to present conditions, i.e., as to\ndifficulty of finding water, which are adapted to the dowser's art.\nGroup (b) \u2014Old Well Too Deep.\nYarlington House [Additional Case]. In a letter to Mr. Andrew\nLang, Mr. T. E. Rogers, M.A., Deputy Chairman of the Somerset\nQuarter Sessions, Chancellor of the Diocese of Bath and Wells, etc.,\nwrites :\u2014,\nYarlington House, Whicanton, December 4th, 1897.\nOver fifty years ago a very respectable farmer at Ditcheat, Kingston by\nname, a tenant of Squire Dawes, was well known in this part of the country\nfor his success in the discovery of underground springs.\nIn my own case he was attended with extraordinary success. My grand\nfather, when building this house in 1782, sank 135 ft. for a well, and only\nthen came to a very slight supply ; so trifling, that after having for some\nfew years drawn up water with the aid of a donkey, he closed the well\naltogether, and used to send nearly half a mile for spring water. Upon my\nsending for this man Kingston, in 1846, he found a spring not 20 yards\nfrom the old well, which has quite sufficiently supplied the house, and at a\ndepth of about 32 ft.\nI should mention that Kingston used not a thorn but the main-spring of\na watch. He had no idea how the action was produced, and was not\nconscious of any sensation passing through him. He assured me that the\ninfluence acted with equal force on the main-spring in his hand whether the\nspring [of water] was 10 or 50 yards deep. I have walked with him holding\none end of the main-spring, which in my hand was perfectly atiS\" and\nimmobile, while the end in his hand was twisting and turning so violently\nthat, unless he let it go, it must inevitably have snapped ; and on some\noccasions it did absolutely snap T F R i\nOn visiting Yarlington, Mr. Rogers showed me the sites of the two\nwells, which are about 40 yds. apart. He informed me that the\ndepth of the old well was 130 ft. or a little more, and that the water\nin the new well was found at a depth of 35 ft. in oolite.\nAt the entrance lodge, 300 yds. E.N.E. of the new well, and on\nthe same level, is a well 40 ft. deep, containing 5 ft. of water : the\nlodgekeeper said it was a good supply, sinking only 3 ft. in the\ndriest summers.\nMr. Rogers said that below the loose oolite (Inferior Oolite) which\nforms the top of the hill, is a little layer of marl, and below this a\n\f318 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nsandy loam (Midford Sands). The oolite and sands are seen in the\nsides of the road going down to Yarliugton village, about 130 feet\nbelow the house.\nFrom the water in the wells at the house and the lodge occurring\nat the same level in the same horizontal bed of limestone, I infer that\nit is held up by the marl and forms a continuous stratum, which in\nthe old well was lost by penetrating into the permeable sands below.\nSince writing the above, I see that sheet 18 of the Geological\nSurvey, which was published July 5th, 1850, four years after the new\nwell was sunk, shows a line of fault passing N. and S. exactly over\nit ; but, as there is no reason to suppose that geological maps are\ndrawn with this degree of accuracy, it is more likely, if a fault has\nanything to do with the matter, that the old well was on it, since its\ntendency would be to let out the water at the bottom\u2014in which case\nthe dowser may claim whatever credit there is for not putting his well\non the same line. Mr. Rogers has revised the foregoing.\nGroup (c)\u2014Old Well on the Side of a Hill.\nA well so situated is no evidence for any unusual faculty in a\ndowser who finds a better supply in the interior of the hill at a slightly\nhigher level, especially where the escarpment is steep and the strata\nrather impermeable, as in the case of two wells (Nos. 2 and 3) on\neither side of Locking churchyard (see Group (d), No. 28, par 2 ; p. 321).\nGroup (d)\u2014Dowser's Well the Deeper.\nNo. 9. Eeercreech Junction. \u2014 [An unsuccessful well was sunk to nearly the\nsame depth as a second, which was located with the twig 6yds. from it, and\nyielded 36,000 gallons a day. Date about 1892. Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.\nXIII., V. 33.]\nThe well at Messrs. Roles' milk factory is situated a few yards\nto the south of the railway station. The strata are the upper part\nof the Lower Lias. The proprietor called an old man answering\nto the name of Tommy, who had worked in the unsuccessful well. He\nsaid it was from 50 to 55 ft. deep in hard blue marl, and that about\n40 to 50 ft. down they had tunnelled in three directions \u2014in one\ndirection for about 17 ft. This well is now filled up.\nThe new well is 12 to 15 ft. distant from the old one The\nproprietor said its depth was from 65 to 67 ft., and that it contained\nover 40 ft. of water. The top soil consisted of 10 to 12 ft. of\nyellow clay, blue at the bottom, and below this 55 ft. of very hard\nblue marl which had to be blasted, but which fell to pieces on exposure\nto the weather. At the bottom was a thin seam of \" scale \" or hard\nrock about half an inch thick, and on breaking through this the water\nrose quickly. About 3,000 gallons a day are used for the milk factory.\n\fxxxvin.] Appendix A. 319\nAt Owley Farm, about 180 yds. S.W. of the wells and about 18 ft.\nlower, is an old well 49 ft. deep, containing 44| ft. of water. The\nbottom of this well is thus on a level with that of Roles' new well,\nand the water in it also stands apparently at the same level. From\nthis we may infer that the strata are approximately horizontal, and\nthat the same stratum of artesian water has been tapped in each case.\nI therefore quite agree with \"Tommy,\" who said, referring to the\nunsuccessful well, \" I believe if we had gone down deeper we should\nhave found the spring.\" Mr. H. J. Roles, to whom I submitted the\nforegoing, writes : \u2014\u2022\" Your report re the well at this place appears to\nme to bo correct.\"\nThe local opinion of the difficulty of finding potable water is shown\nby the circumstance that the supply for the Junction is brought by rail.\nNo. 17. Sturminster Newton. \u2014[A well was sunk 50 ft. without a drop of\nwater. Mr. J. F. Young and three of his family pointed out a spot a few\nyards away where a well was sunk, which at a less depth delivers a plentiful\nsupply. Proceedings S.'P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 40.]\nThe wells referred to by Mr. Young are situated a few hundred\nfeet from an escarpment of Corallian rock (Coral Rag on Calcareous\nGrit) about 50 ft. high, facing west and overlooking the river Stour.\nThe \"village doctor,\" Dr. J. Comyns Leach, The Lindens, Sturminster,\ninformed me that the unsuccessful well, referred to by Mr. J. F. Young,\nwas sunk by him (the doctor) at the house about 60 yds. to the N.E. of\nhis own, now occupied by Dr. R. A. Beaver. It was first sunk to a\ndepth of about 35 ft., when it held 16 ft. of water, but on sinking it\n3 ft. lower the water was lost. In June, 1893, the well sinker lost\nhis life in the well from bad air, in consequence of which it was\nabandoned, after going to a total depth of 41 feet.\nThe second or successful well is 30 yds. from the first, and was\nplaced at a convenient spot in the stable yard without reference to\nany predictions by Mr. Young or his family, of which the doctor was\nunaware. It is 45 ft. deep and holds 6 or 7 ft. of water.\nEighty yards west of the second well, there is at the doctor's own\nhouse a third well (marked P. on the Ordnance map), which is only\n38 ft. deep and holds from 7 to 14 ft. of water, according to the season.\nHence, as these three wells are on level ground, and in a tolerably\npervious rock, there is nothing remarkable in having found water in\nthe stable well below the bottom of the unsuccessful one. Dr. Leach,\nwho has revised this account, never had to pay for carting water ;\nand this is confirmed by Mr. J. F. Young's father, Mr. Robert Young\n(the author of works in the Dors.'t dialect), to whom, as also to Mr.\nJ. F. Young, I have submitted the foregoing. The latter writes that\nhis report to Professor Barrett was first sent for local correction, but\n\f320 Professor W. F. Barrett.

Then the water-finder, Sims, indicated a spot on another\npart of the premises, where a well was sunk and a magnificent spring was\ndiscovered in a fault of the rock at a depth of 40 feet. Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. XIII., p. 49.]\nThe diviner in this case was Mr. Charles Sims, a professional\ndowser, now living at Pilton, a village rather more than two miles\nfrom Shepton Mallet. The Anglo-Bavarian Brewery is situated on\na submerged island of Carboniferous Limestone, and the unsuccessful\nwell was sunk in the front yard, through Lower Lias and Limestone,\nto a depth, according to a foreman who had been present, of about\n100 or 120 ft., the lower half of this being a 6 inch boring.\nMr. Sims' well is in the hamlet of Bowlish, 500 yds. distant from\nthe unsuccessful well and 95 ft. below it. The land is at the extreme\npoint of the Company's premises, and was acquired consequent on\nthe successful sinking. The well is 22 ft. in diameter and 40 ft.\ndeep. It is in the bottom of a narrow valley, and 65 ft. south of a\nsmall stream, the river Sheppey, which runs west from Shepton\nMallet. Just above the well a quarry is being worked in littoral\nLower Lias limestones without the usual clayey partings ; on the\nother side of the valley, 200 yds. to the north, is a protrusion of\nCarboniferous limestone ; but the well itself, according to Mr. Phillis,\na geologist formerly at the brewery, is almost certainly in Lias.\nHe said they got no water at first even at 40 ft ; but he went\ndown the well, and, seeing a place that looked damp, told them he\nthought they would get it by driving there, which they did, and it\nwas found to drain the wells in Coombe Lane to the south. The\nwater came in from both sides of the valley, but he thought it too far\nfrom the stream to filter through, though possible. The supply was\ninsufficient for the brewery, and is now discontinued in favour of that\nfrom an open spring at Darshill, a mile lower down the valley.\nThe case is not evidential on account of the wells being so remote\nthe successful one being also the lower of the two, and placed at the\nmost likely spot for water. This was also the opinion of the people\nat the brewery and of Mr. Phillis, who have both revised the above.\nNo. 28.

Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 50.]\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A. 321\nOn visiting Locking, in company with our informant, Mr. W.\nG. Hellier, I found (referring to the sketch-map given on page 51\nof Professor Barrett's paper) that just north of well No. 4 an east\nand west fault throws down horizontal Lias on the north against\nRed Marls on the south. The marl has been worked out by a stream,\nand the dowsed well (No. 1 ) is in the bottom of the valley not far from\nthe same ; whereas the non-dowsed wells (Nos. 3 and 4) are near the\ntop and bottom respectively of the steep scarp of Lias, and are not\nless than 30 and 10 ft. respectively higher than No. 1. Hence, as\nNo. 1 reaches a level 20 ft. or more deeper than either of them, the\noccurrence of a constant supply of water in it is no evidence for\ndowsing. \u00ab\nThe church and vicarage on the top of the hill are on practically\nlevel ground, which, at the other dowsed well (No. 2), may be a few\n(say 5) feet above No. 3 : No. 2 is also stated to be 2 ft. shallower,\nand to contain plenty of water. On the other hand, No. 3 is sunk on\nthe steep side of the hill, which cannot be expected to hold water so\nwell as at No. 2, some 50 yds. back from the edge.\nLocking is the only place where I did not take measurements ;\ngoing round with Mr. Hellier I could not at the time, and it did not\nseem worth while to return for the purpose. At the well on Sandford\nGreen, which we next visited, I found the measurements had been\ncorrectly given by Mr. Hellier, so presume those he gives for Locking\nare correct. The well is in Red Marl of the Trias, and contained\n19\u00a3 ft. of water. The site of the old well, now filled up, was about\n20 ft. distant, but, as no record of its depth has been kept, no\nconclusion can be drawn.\nLadyswood Park [Additional Case].\u2014The following paragraph\nappears in the Bristol Times and Mirror of March 7th, 1891, p. 16 ;\nand, with the words in brackets, in the Medium of March 13th,\np. 167 :\u2014\nEver since the erection of the new mansion at Ladyswood Park, Sherston\nMagna [Wiltshire], the question of its water supply has been one of trouble\nand serious consideration. A few years ago, Sir T. Dancer, Bart., had two\nwells sunk, but without success in finding water. The estate having recently\nbeen purchased by Mr. Francis Davis, he determined to requisition the\nservices of Daniel Lacy [a local diviner]. Lacy went to work with his little\ntwig, and discovered a spring about 15 yds. from the two existing useless\nwells. He at once set his men to work, and after sinking to a depth of\n60 ft. found an abundant spring, the output being practically inexhaustible.\nLadyswood Park is the \" Ladyswood Farm \" of the old one-inch\nmap ; it is about a mile S.E. of Sherston, on a plain of Forest\nMarble. On visiting Ladyswood in May, 1899, Mr. Davis showed me\n2 a\n\f322 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nthe position of the three wells, and said he had just measured the\ndepth of Lacy's, which was 74 ft, and that the water stood 53 ft.\nfrom the surface, higher than he had ever known it before. I then\nsaw Sidney Lacy, of Sherston, who said he had helped his father sink\nthe well, which was in thin bedded rock much the same all the way\ndown. They struck the water at the bottom after putting in a blast.\nThe new well is certainly lower than the old one, but they would not\nhave got water by sinking the old one deeper, because his father, after\ntrying the stick, said they would not, and he had never known his\nfather wrong.\nWith regard to the old wells, Sidney Lacy said he went down the\nsecond (B) u. remove the pump, and should think the depth was from\n60 to 70 ft., but couldn't say exactly. The first (A) was also about\n60 ft. : it was Lawrence, of Bristol, who dowsed it and sunk it. Mr.\nDavis said the B well was sunk by Mr. Simon Evans, of Sherston.\nEvans said that, as near as he remembered, its depth was 44 or 54 ft.,\nwith some water, and that on boring another 25 ft. with a three-inch\nbore they got plenty : the A well was, he said, 25 ft. deep, with no\nwater.\nAs water in thin-bedded, horizontal limestones would probably lie\nin a uniform stratum, the failure of the old wells is sufficiently\nexplained by, according to Lacy's figures, their not having been sunk\ndeep enough, or, according to Evans', not deep enough to hold the\nwater met with in his boring.\nGroup (e)\u2014Heading driven towards Known Water.\nNo 42. Henbury. \u2014[In this case Mr. Crisp, the architect, writing in 1883,\nsays that when water was required at Mr. Butterworth's new house, a\ngeologist predicted plenty at a depth of 150 ft., where he said the Mountain\nLimestone rested on a bed of clay. They sank 150 ft. and bored 10 ft., but\nfound no water. Then the diviner, Lawrence, predicted water about 20 ft.\nfrom the well, and advised driving a heading about 100 ft. from the surface.\nThey drove 30 ft., and got a good and regular supply.

The well is\nin Mountain Limestone, and about 50 yds. from its escarpment,\nwhich runs parallel to the Severn and shows the rock much faulted\nand contorted, as it was in the well. This escarpment is a Triassic\ncliff flanked by a beach deposit of Dolomitic Conglomerate. On the\nlower slopes are Red Marls which help to hold up the water in the\nlimestone ; the ground at the foot of the hill at Lawrence Weston\nbeing 120 ft. or more below the ground at the welL\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A. 323\nThe principal point omitted in previous reports of this case is the\nexistence of an old well 123 yds. to the S.S.W. of Rockwell well and\n123 ft. deep, with water standing 94 ft. from the surface. This\nold well belongs to a disused Friends' Meeting House : the place is\nnow called Fern Hill and is occupied by Mr. H. Fedden. At Rockwell\nwell the ground is about 19 ft. below the old well, and the water stands\n81 ft. from the surface, or about 6 ft. below the water in the old well,\nwhich, allowing for the distance, shows both wells to be probably\nin the same stratum of water. And, as Rockwell well is 150 ft. deep,\nthe bottom of it is 75 ft. below the level of the water in the old well.\nThe heading at Rockwell runs from the well under the front of the\nhouse, which lies to the S.S.W. The length of the heading, Mr. Jolly\ntold me, is about 75 ft. ; but Mr. Crisp, the architect, in his report\nsays it is about 30 ft. ; and Mr. Mereweather, the contractor, gives it\nas 24 ft. ; the important point is the direction, directly towards\nthe old well.\nMr. Mereweather informed me that the Rockwell well was sunk\nwithout getting water beyond a soakage from the top layers after\nrain ; he noticed, however, a damp place on one side about 100 ft.\nfrom the top ; Mrs. Bengough then tried the ground with a divining\nrod, which turned at a point 16 ft. from the well. Mrs. Bengough in\nher own account {Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 104) says the distance\nwas about 6 ft., and that Lawrence came later the same afternoon, and\nin the presence of herself and of many persons who had witnessed her\ntrials, pointed to the same place. [Crisp says the point Lawrence\nindicated was about 20 feet from the well.]\nMr. Mereweather told me that neither Mrs. Bengough nor Lawrence\nwent down the well, and that he was not present when Lawrence came.\nBut as we cannot now be sure that Mereweather's information about\nthe damp place had not reached one or both of them indirectly, or that\nthey had not heard of the old well \u2014which indeed the old house itself\nwas sufficient to suggest\u2014it remains doubtful whether Lawrence's in\ndication shows more than knowledge normally acquired. At any rate\nhe proposed the obvious course of driving a heading in the direction of\nthe old well, and 25 ft. below the level of the water in it.\nNo. 60. Sheptmi Mallet Station.\u2014[The contractors write in 1882 that in\n1874 they sank a well 103 (or 90) ft. through blue lias rock with no traces\nof water. Then John Mullins with a twig predicted an abundance at 15 (or\n50) ft. from the well, and advised a heading, on driving which the water\nrushed in and the miners rushed out, and their tools and watches are there\ntill this day. Proceedings S.P.R., Vols. II., p. 107, and XIII., p. 86].\nThe well in question supplies locomotives at Charlton Station, of\nthe Somerset and Dorset Railway, on the eastern side of Shepton\n2 a 2\n\f324 Professor W. F. Barrett, [part\nMallet ; it is placed between the rails and the building marked\n\"Tank\" on the 25-inch map. My principal informant here was Wm.\nBaiss, an old man at the station, who said that, though not present\nwhen Mullins found the water, he was working on the railway near\nby and heard all about it. He said they sank through several sorts\nof stone to a depth of 90 ft., without water. (Mr. Hickes, in the\nDaily Graphic, also gives the depth as 90 ft. ; Mr. Whitaker, the\nlocomotive superintendent at Highbridge, writes that it is now about\n80 ft.) Then about 8 or 9 ft. from the bottom they drove a heading\nin an easterly direction through some blue marl, and struck a spring\nat from 15 to 20 ft. from the well. No red marl was met with, and\nhe thinks the well is probably all in Lias. Mr. John Phillis, a local\ngeologist (who has revised this account), agrees in this, and does not\nthink they got down on the limestone (Carboniferous), the nearest\noutcrop of which is a mile distant. The engine-attendant stated\nthat they pumped some 20,000 gallons a day, which has never failed\neven in the driest summers. Mr. Whitaker says that, when no\npumping is done, the water stands below rail level about 37 ft. in\nwinter and about 51 ft. in summer.\nAt a point 280 yds. north-east of the well, at the bottom of a\nvalley in which runs a little stream\u2014the river Sheppey\u2014rises an open\nspring. It supplies Charlton brewery, and may have been long known,\nas the Roman Fosseway passes within a few feet of it. Its escaping\nlevel is 43 ft. below the ground at the station well, and hence within a\nfoot of the average level of the water in it.\nClose by the station well, and on the same side of the rails, a\nquarry shows 15 ft. of Lower Lias, dense, well-jointed blue and white\nlimestones in beds of about one foot thick, alternating with from\none to three inches of hard blue sandy clay. Notwithstanding the\ngenerally impermeable appearance of these beds, we must take it as\npossible, not to say probable, that, with a head of 50 ft. of water at\na point variously given as from 15 to 50 ft. distant from the well,\nthere would be at least a dampness on that side. In the account\nwritten by the contractors in 1882 [Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II.,\np. 107), we read that \"on his arrival he [Mullins] went down the\nwell,\" so that his location of the water \"after he came up\" cannot\nnow be taken as showing more than his conscious or unconscious\nobservation, or inference from the position of the brewery spring,\nwhich he was probably told of, as I was.\nSince writing this I have seen the quarry a few hours after heavy\nrain and found it hold the water, except in the N.E. corner, where a\nmain joint, running exactly in the direction of the brewery spring,\nforms a swallow-hole. It was doubtless such a joint as this that\nMullins' heading cut into.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A. 325\nGroup (f)\u2014Dowser's Well near Known Water; Old Well\nusually Remote.\nNo. 43 (the same as No. 59) Hedgecocks. \u2014[The architect, who in 1878\n(or 1879) was erecting a house for Mr. J. T. Ronton, at Hedgecock's Farm,\nwrites in 1883 that the contractors \"proceeded to form a well close to the\nnew building, and had bored a very considerable distance without coming to\nwater.\" Then Liwrence predicted water a few yards from the boring, and\nthey sank about 40 ft. (some 42 ft.) exactly on a good spring B, which, he\nbelieves, continues to supply the house. There was an old well A some\n100yds. distant with little or no water. Proceedings S.P.R., Vols. II., pp.\n103-104 ; and XIII., p. 68.\nIn 1897, W. Renton, son of J. T. R., writes that the two wells, about\n27 ft. deep, were only land springs and apt to get dry. So he had John\nMullins divine a place, C, within six inches of which he found a good supply\nat about 26 ft. He also employed Mullins on three other successful wells.\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 86.]\nHedgecock's Farm is on the border of Sussex about four miles N.W. of\nHorsham. On visiting it in June, 1898, I found it in the occupation of the\nDuchess di Santo Teodora, and the name changed to Oakwood House ; and\nnow (1899) to Oak Grange. Mr. Jupp, a well sinker, who had been employed\non Mullins' wells, told me there were three wells on the premises, of which\ntwo had been found by Mullins about 1893. One C, at the back of the house,\nnow built over, is, he said, in hard blue marl 25 ft. deep with only 2^ ft. of\nwater, and can be pumped out in about twenty minutes, though Mullins said\nthere was water sufficient for everything. Another well, D, marked by\nMullins close to the road some 50 yds. west of the house, is 20 ft. deep\nin blue marl and has a good lot of water. Another, E, dug about 1893\nis 15 (or 30) ft. deep and supplies the vineries.\nI also saw a new well, F, that had just been sunk 100yds. or so north\nof the house, 43 or 44 ft. deep in soft dark marl (Weald Clay). A slight\nspring had been met with at 25 ft. ; and at 40 ft. in a dove-colored marl\nwater was found, which rose 7 ft. in a night and stands about 21 ft. from the\nsurface.\nThus against one unsuccessful boring we have at least six successful\nwells, of which A and F sunk without a dowser are 27 and 44 ft. deep ; while\nthe dowsed wells B, C, and D, are 42, 25, and 20 ft. As the ground is\napproximately level, I infer a main water-bearing bed at about 40 ft. and a\nminor one at from 20 to 25 ft.\nThis is supported by the occurrence of water at other points along the\nlevel ridge which extends from Hedgecocks over two miles westwards to\nRudgwick (Ridgewick). Thus the entrance lodge has a draw-pump ; the\nadjoining cottage, 15 ft. lower, has a well 25 ft. deep ; Rudge Farm,\n600yds. W., has a draw-pump ; a cottage 1,600 yds. W. has a well 18ft.\ndeep with 5 ft. of water ; and a quarter mile further a spring rises about\n13 ft. below the top of the ridge.\nThis ridge is the first high ground in the Weald south of Leith Hill, and\nrepresents the escarpment of a hard or porous bed ; which, according to\nTopley (Geology of the Weald, p. 104) is the same, \" No. 2, sand and sand\nstone,\" that forms the water-bearing bed at Warnham Lodge, ljf miles\n\f326 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nE.S.E.\u2014already described, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 278-279.\nThe elevation, about 280 ft. O.D., is also the same.\nAt Hedgecocks, though the bed is less permeable, water seems to have\nbeen found everywhere except in the contractors' boring, the actual depth\nof which I have been unable to ascertain ; in their letter (Vol. II., p. 103)\nthey do not refer to it at all. If as deep as the wells, it corresponds with\nthe dry ground in the Warnham Lodge bed. The case is interesting from\nthe successful employment of two leading English dowsers, though the\nnecessity for their services may not be altogether demonstrated.\nNo. 47. Park Farm.\u2014[Lawrence marked two spots at each of which,\nafter boring 10 ft., water was struck. As many persons said water might be\nfound anywhere in the field, the tenant, as a test, bored to the same depth\nmidway between the places, and found the subsoil to be perfectly dry.\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 71.]\nThis is the same place as the \" Parks Farm \" of the old\none-inch map : it is on the Gloucester Road, S.E. of Frampton-on-\nSevern, and two miles north of Dursley Junction. The subsoil is stiff\nclay of the Lower Lias. Lawrence's well is just outside the garden\ngate, and is, Mrs. Prout said, 25 ft. deep ; 10 yds. south of it is a pond\nabout 10 yds. in diameter and 2 ft. deep, the level of which is 4J ft.\nbelow the ground at the well.\nSixty yards north of the well is another pond about 15 yds. in\ndiameter. The unsuccessful boring was made midway between these\nponds.\nThe other successful boring was made, I was informed, by a man\non the farm, about 20 yds. to the north of the north pond ; he said\nthey got at the bottom a sort of marly stuff, not very hard, in which\nthe water came.\nMrs. Prout said that the water in Lawrence's well is salt, and is\nnot used, and that all the water to Stonehouse is salt. The ponds go\ndry in summer, but Lawrence came at the end of March, or beginning\nof April, when they were full.\nI think the proximity of the successful borings to the ponds (10\nand 20yds.) raises a presumption of their connection; and similarly\nthe boring midway between the ponds may have been unsuccessful on\naccount of its comparative remoteness.\nI have not been able to communicate with Mr. Prout, but the\nsteward, Mr. T. T. Vizard, of Dursley, writes in regard to the fore\ngoing :\u2014\" Your particulars are, so far as I know, correct. I do not\nthink the well can be supplied with water from the ponds near,\nbecause I believe the ponds become dry in the summer, but that the\nwell always contains water.\"\nPerhaps, however, as the well is not used, it would be safer to say\nthat there is no evidence either way, as water would remain below\nground after drying at the surface.\n\fxxxvn i.] Appendix A. 327\nNo. 57.

He also predicted close to the house a very strong spring about\n20 ft. down, and on sinking 17 ft. it came so fast they could sink no further.\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 84.]\nThis is the same place as the \" Lower Norton Farm \" of the\nold one-inch map : it is three miles north of Campden. The Hall\nstands at the end of a ridge of Lower Lias. Mr. Bruce said that die\n\" gravel \" in the clay consists of pebbles, which is suggestive of\nDrift (?). He gave me every facility for examining the wells at -the\nhouse, of which there are three, viz :\u2014\n(a) An old well in the house yard 25 ft. deep, and 11 ft. 9 in. to\nthe water ; supply insufficient ; this had been shown to Mullins.\n(4) Mullins' well in the stable yard, 28 ft. 6 in. deep, and 8 ft. 9 in.\nto the water.\n(c) Mullins' well, \" close to the house,\" by the drawing-room window,\n17 ft. deep, and 1 1 ft 8 in. to the water.\nOn levelling, I found c to be 6 in. above a, and a 2 ft. 5 in. above 6.\nHence the water in b and c is at the same level, and that in a 7 in.\nlower. But a had been pumped that morning. Hence the water in\nall three wells is on a level. Mr. Bruce said also that pumping a\nlowers c. Hence the water in all three wells is in the same stratum.\nThe unsuccessful well at the entrance lodge, though on the same\nridge and nearly the same level as the Hall, is 6OO yds. distant.

[part\nMr. Bayley said that the old well at the house was 60 ft deep in grey,\nsoapy, shaley clay, and gave an inadequate supply of water ; it was\nbored another 100 ft. without getting any more.\nMr. W. H. Mullins' well is about 650 yds. distant at the northern\nextremity of the property. It is close to the railway, on a little rising\nground so as to be convenient for gravitation, and is 40 yds. from and\n18 ft. above a stream of water which is fed by springs from Leith\nHill and flows all the year round. Mr. Bayley's gardener informed\nme that the well was sunk 99 ft. deep in grey, soapy clay without\nstone (Weald Clay). There were little springs the size of a straw all\nthe way down, but the supply was small \u2014 about 3 ft. in the twenty-\nfour hours\u2014and it became necessary to augment it.\nBetween the well and the stream is a narrow, flat piece of ground\napparently alluvial in character, and about midway on this the rod\nindicated water. Here, 6\u00a3 ft. above the stream, a second well was\nsunk to a depth of 10 ft., and an abundant supply was found which\nrises to about the level of the stream. This supply is carried through\nby a drain into the first well, which, in Mr. Bayley's letter ( Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 99) gets all the credit of it.\nAs, however, I see no reason to suppose that the water comes from\nanywhere but the adjoining stream, I cannot regard this case as\nshowing more than ordinary observation.\nNo. 90.

Here he sunk a well, C, 7 ft. deep,\nand got an abundant supply nearly always running.

According to Mr. W. H.\nCole, a former tenant of Wootton Farm, it was dug when the Wood-\nside house was built, about 1850, and the water was brought down\nin pipes. Mr. Stone's statements, that it is \" 30 ft. deep and no\nwater,\" and that \" the owners of the estate had never been able to\nobtain water,\" are incorrect. This well is in sands of the Hamstead\nseries.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A. 329\nThe first well sunk by Stone was, Mr. Taylor informed me, at\na point about 20 yds. to the east of B, but he did not get enough\nwater and the well was abandoned ; if so, Stone's statement that he\nfound an enormous spring in ten minutes is incorrect.\nStone then dug the well C 60 yds. to the S.E. of B, and thence\ncarried a trench about 80 yds. to the south as far as the road, the\nground at all these points being practically at the same level. This\ntrench was about 10 ft. deep and cut through gravel (Pleistocene\nPlateau), sand (Hamstead Beds), and some clay (Bembridge Marls).\nThe water is collected by a drain and carried into C ; the principal\nflow was met with a few yards from C.\nMore recently, in order to supply another house, another collecting\ndrain has been carried up on the south side of the road, and curved\nround into the field to the west of Stone's drain, so as to head off the\nfurther end of it, since when, Taylor said, there has been a noticeable\nfalling off in the supply. Subsequently also to Stone's visit a sand pit\nhas been opened about 130 yds. west of C, showing 3 ft. of gravel on\nsand, in which at a depth of 15 ft. a body of water was found. The\noutcrop of this sand coincides nearly with that of the plateau gravel ;\nthe two together forming a natural reservoir over a quarter of a mile\nwide capping the hill.\nAlong the eastern edge of the hill I saw some ponds, and rills of\nwater running down to the creek : Mr. Cole said there were nine\nsuch \" runs \" of water within a mile, and that they run all the\nyear round. I also discussed the matter with the agent for the\nWoodside estate, Mr. George Barton of Wootton Farm, with Mr.\nW. H. Cole, and with Mr. John Newbury of Wootton, all of whom\nagreed that there was water everywhere on the top of the hill, that\nit was known to every one, and that it did not want a divining rod\nto find it. These opinions expressed after the event must be taken\nfor what they are worth ; on the other hand, the occurrence of water\nat other points on the hill-top, and in particular at B, 60 yds. distant,\nfrom which the house had been formerly supplied, was a matter of\ncommon knowledge.\nArreton, Isle of Wight.1\u2014The diviner, W.

[part\nrose to the top,\" and he kid it on to the rectory and village by gravitation.\nProceedUqs S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 130-131, 133.]\nThis is the only case inserted by Professor Barrett without local\ninquiry, which he asks for on p. 133 of his paper ; as such it was not\nnumbered or claimed as evidence ; but, having been published, I give\na more correct version as showing the humours of the subject. The\nvillage of Arreton lies at the foot of the downs that form the\ncentral Cretaceous escarpment. Besides going over the ground, I\nobtained information from Mr. George Barton, of Wootton Farm, who\nhad got the dowser to go to Arreton, from a resident at Arreton, and\nfrom Mr. Orchard, the parish clerk.\nThey say that the dowser's quoted statements are incorrect, and\nthat where he placed his first reservoir he never got any water at all.\nHe was so sure there was water that, before getting any, he began by\nmaking a large reservoir 9 ft. deep with pipes down to the cottages on\nthe S.W. side of the church. There was rain and snow at the time\n(the Daily Graphic of April 18th, 1S92, says : \" the snow on the 16th\nwas four inches deep in most parts of the Isle of Wight \") which filled\nthe reservoir 2 ft. deep, and with that and the water in the pipes he\ngot, when the tap was turned on at the cottages, a powerful jet\nwhich was photographed ; but after a few minutes it ran out and there\nhas never been a drop since. The photograph appeared in the Daily\nGraphic, of April 23rd, under the heading \" A Water Wizard in the\nIsle of Wight,\" together with a statement that the spring had proved\nmore than sufficient to supply the wants of the village.\nThe dowser then tried, said Mr. Orchard, to find a spring higher\nup the hill by running back a trench from the top of his tank, but\nwhen he got 22 ft. deep he got into the freestone and then he stopped,\nbecause he knew that if he got any water it would run away. This\npoint would be some 30 yds. north of the reservoir. Forty yards\nfurther up the hill Upper Greensand is seen dipping 40 deg. into the\nhill, and, if the \"freestone \" forms its base, then the dowser's reservoir\nand trench must be on the apex of a wedge of Gault Clay, the last\nplace in the district where there could be any water. Or if they\noccupy (as according to the new six-inch geological map they do,\nthough I doubt its accuracy) a similar position on the outcrop of the\nCarstone, a coarse, hard grit beneath the Gault, the apex of this mass\nof sand rock would be equally incapable of holding water. If, as the\ndowser states, an unsuccessful well was sunk within 20 yds. of his, to\na depth of 50 ft., without finding a drop of water, it shows that the\nwater-level in this Neocomian sandrock is still lower.\nFailing to find water here, the dowser then made a second reservoir,\n40 ft. below the first, on the east side of some marshy ground in a\nlittle valley above the churchyard, and thence carried a drain alongside\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A. 331\nthe marsh some 30 yds. to the north.

Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. XIII., p. 180.]\nIn this case the unsuccessful boring had been made at the\nbottom of an old well at Farm Hill House, in the terrace at the\ntop of the lawn. The butler who showed it me said it was about\n50 ft. deep, and contained plenty of water except one very dry\nsummer. Before Mr. Gataker came, Messrs. Orchard and Peer, of\nStroud, bored some 20 ft. at the bottom of it with the idea of\ngetting more water, and did not. This firm, who are not professional\nwell-sinkers, write that the well is 30 ft. deep, and that they bored\n35 ft. deeper in clay, clay bats and marl clay. The well is about\n240 yds. south of Gataker's, and at a level from 50 to 60 ft. lower.\nThere is also a well under the house still in use. These wells are in\nthe top of the Upper Lias.\nMr. Gataker's well is in the field above the house and is 45 ft.\ndeep, with water 24 ft. from the surface. He (Gataker) said the\nwater would be found 60 ft. down, but they got it at 40 ft. all\nround the sides of the well. The rock, according to Mr. Bastin, the\ngardener, consisted of 20 ft. of rock rubble and sandy freestone\n(Inferior Oolite remanie), with yellow clay at the base : below this\nwas 10 ft. or so of slate-coloured clay, and several feet of loose reddish\ngrit like sea sand, and gravelly rubble with water (Midford Sands).\nAt the house of Mr. Allen's gardener, 110 yds. west of Gataker's\nwell and from 6 to 7 ft. above it, is a well which the gardener, Mr.\nHarwood, said contained plenty of water. Mr. Riley, a working\nplumber in Stroud, who had repaired it two years ago, said it was\nfrom 35 to 40 ft. deep, and contained more than 5 and less than\n1 0 ft. of water, which would make the water about 30 ft. from the\nsurface. Hence the water in Gataker's well stands at the same level.\nThere is also, 300 yds. E.S.E. of Gataker's well and from 60 to\n70 ft. below it in the same field, a well 16 ft. deep, containing 8 ft.\nof water, affording a small but good supply for cattle. About 50 yds.\nshort of this a spring rises in wet weather and forms a bog ; this,\naccording to the Survey map, marks the base of the Midford Sands.\n\f332 Professor W. F. Barrett.

It contained a little\nwater which percolated from the river.\nMr. Tompkins' well is from 80 to 90 yds. to the W.S.W. of\nthe first well, and 50 yds. from the river and from 10 to 12 ft. above\nit. The water is 1 1 ft. from the surface. The engineer said there\nwas a good supply, and he did not think it had to do with the river.\nThe soil, Mr. Maggs' son said, was stiff white clay and blue marl\nwithout any rock, and he thought was mostly made ground, as they\nfound pipes and old chain. Since the feather factory had cut a drain\n-20 ft. deep, some 30 yds. to the south of the well, it had not had so\nmuch water ; this a neighbour confirmed, and said that lots of water\nwas met with in the drain at the point nearest to the well. There is\nalso a well which supplies an old house some 40 yds. from Tompkins\nwell on the side remote from the river.\nHence, as Tompkins' well is in what appears to be an alluvial flat,\nwhere water was known to exist within 50 yds. on either side, I cannot\nregard its occurrence at the point indicated by him as surprising.

The\nwell at the house is 76 ft. deep and supplies about 500 gallons a day.\nFifty yards to the north of this, Mullins found water at 25 ft. only ;\nthe amount, however, that has been pumped daily is comparatively\nsmall, less than 100 gallons.\nAt the farm in North Heath Lane, about 350 yds. further north,\nis a well 67 ft. deep which always went dry in dry seasons, though\nhored to 83 ft. In October, 1897, at a point 50 yds. to the east, Mullins\npredicted a spring at 70 or 80 ft., and proceeded to sink on the terms\nof \"no supply, no pay.\" Water was struck at 54ft., and the well,\nwhich is 60 ft. deep, holds 10 ft. of water and yields a large supply.\nThe rock consisted of sand and sandstones of varying hardness with\nsome lignite and ironstone ; the water-bearing bed being a dove-\ncolored marl.

Tui\/ Farm. \u2014[The following abstract is from the accounts by\nthe steward, Mr. T. W. Pickard, written in 1893 and 1896 (Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 154). It includes additions received from him dated\nNovember 6th and 25th, 1899, and the whole has had his revision : \u2014\nAbout 30 years ago a well was sunk at the Farm for some distance, and\nthen abandoned on account of bad air. After this another well was dug,\n167 ft. deep, but no water was found. Some short time before 1893 I\npersonally took the depth ; it was then quite dry, and the old men living at\nthe place never remembered water there.\nIn 1893 Mr. Tompkins, of Chippenham, was engaged. I purposely met\nhim at the station and drove him to the place. He had no idea to what\npart of the estate he had to go until he got there, and he had no private\nconversation with any of the men there. He went over the ground tracing\nall the springs to one point, 450 ft. from the old well and from 8 to 10 ft.\nabove it, and said that water would be found at a depth of 70 ft. I have\nmarked on the enclosed tracing from the 25 in. map, as near as I can\nrecollect, the lines he traced (they form a star of six sinuous lmes over\n100 yds. long).\nAfter he had found the place for the new well I took him to the old well,\nwhich had been covered up with strong timber ; to mark the site there was a\nsmall heap of mould on which cucumbers were growing. I sent him over\nthis with his twig, which made no movement. I then told him he had been\nover an old well several times : I told him the depth, and asked him how he\nthought it possible to find water nearer the surface such a short distance\naway. He replied that the old well was out of the run of the springs.\nWe dug at the spot selected, and the first 20 ft. of chalk was rubbly\n[probably decomposed]. Nearly 70 ft. down we came on a level bed of\nsolid flint about 6 to 9 in. thick ; and at 70 ft. on open fissures mostly\nvertical, which were wet as though water had recently passed through ;\nthere was a very slight dribble at the time.1 At about 118 ft. we struck two\nsprings on opposite sides of the well giving a strong supply, and sunk an\nadditional 6 ft. before the water gained the upper hand. The well is 124 ft.\ndeep, in ordinary white chalk with flints, which continued to the bottom.\nThe well holds 12 ft. of water, the same as when first dug. The water at\n1 Through one of those, according to Mr. Sherlock, a young man at the Farm,\na draught of air came with such force as to be heard at the surface, showing an\nopen fissure of great extent. He said the well takes an hour to pump out, and\nrefills in twelve or less.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A. 335\nthe bottom came through vertical fissures and horizontal veins, and princi\npally from the west side from the directions Tompkins had named from\neither end of the plantation (an enclosure on the hillside to the W. and\nS.W.). We have since bored some 20 ft. to obtain a better supply, but T do\nnot think it has improved it. The old well has been filled in with the\nchalk, etc., from the new one.]\nThis I regard as the best case I have yet met with in favour of\nthe dowser. The farm is situated in a remote hollow of the Sussex\ndowns, midway between Glynde and Newhaven. The valley of which\nit is a ramification falls into the sea at Bishopstone, three miles to\nthe south : half way down the Newhaven Water Company are pump\ning a considerable supply from wells. The old well was close to the\nfarm, and the level of the ground at the well is about 260 ft. above\nthe sea.\nThe new well is 150 yds. further up the valley, and about 22 ft.\nabove the old well. Hence the water standing 12 ft. deep in the new\nwell has a level of no less than 77 ft. above the bottom of the old\nwell. The new well is in chalk with flints. On the heap from it, shown\nin the photograph (p. 337), I found a spine of Cidaris sceptri\/'era, which\nis common in the zone of Micraster cor-anyuinum, so that the thick\nflint-bed 70 ft. down is probably the strong and constant M. cor-\na\/\/^\u00bbi\/\u00bbt\u00bb?i-tabular described by Dr. Rowe as occurring between\nBeachy and Seaford Heads about 62 ft. above the zone of M. cor-\ntestudinarium (Proc. Oeol. Assoc, 1900, Vol. XVI., pp. 322, 323, 329,\n332, 336, Plate IX.). According to this reading the new well is sunk\nentirely in the M. corangninnm chalk and to within 8 ft. of its base ;\nwhich last may account for finding some other fossils, as two or three\nspecimens of 1\/olaster placenta, which are commoner in the lower zone.\nThe bottom of the old well is similarly 57 ft. deep in the zone of\nM. cor-lestudinarium and 52 ft. above its base\u2014it being 109J ft. thick\non the coast (Ibid., p. 327).\nWater in the chalk usually lies at a gentle gradient1 which is\nhowever, modified by the density of particular beds, and by the\npresence of fissures. In the lithology of the beds as seen on the\ncoast there is nothing to explain the absence of water in the old\nwell, or its preferential occurrence in the new well, which is\ndoubtless due to fissures. Water in chalk usually flows in fissures,\n1 The gradient of water in chalk varies considerably, e.g., 13 ft. in a mile\n(Clutterbuck) ; 45 and 47 ft. in a mile (Bland) ; these are normal conditions.\nExceptionally we have 93 and 102 ft. in less than a mile (Bland) ; 155 ft. in half a\nmile (Lucas); and 50 or 9O ft. in less than 100 yards (Anstead). This last, which\nLucas says is greater than he had ever met with, is the only instance I have found at\nall parallel to that at Toy Farm. (See Prestwich's Water-btarin,j Strata, p. 62, and\nTrans. Inst. Sureeyors for 1878, Vol. X., pp. 30G-314.)\n\f336 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\ni.e., in the main planes of jointing, which in this district, as shown by\nthe direction of the valleys, run N. and S., and E. and W.\nThe narrow valley, approximately N. and S., in which the farm\nlies, is slightly sickle-shaped. The house with the old well is about the\nmiddle of the handle, so to speak, and the new well at the ferrule end,\nthe valley at this point being contracted by a slight bulge from the\neast, which may, and probably does, indicate the position of an\nunderground fissure. With this may be taken the fact, noted by the\nsteward, Mr. Pickard, that the water flowed into the well from the\nsides of the valley rather than from its upper end.\nWhether Mr. Tompkins noticed a slight surface feature of this kind\n\u2014I did not myself till I was leaving and saw it foreshortened\u2014and,\nif he did, whether he drew the right inference from it, may be doubtful.\nI think a geologist at any rate would have taken no account of it, but\nwould have advised deepening or tunnelling the old well.1 We must\nremember, however, when we are dealing with automatism, that the\nmere existence of a difference in the valley unnoted, still less reasoned\non, by the dowser, may have been felt by his subconsciousness, intensely\nalert for every indication, and so have determined his action\u2014on\nwhich, unlike the geologist, he can, when his judgment fails, fall back.\nHe can revert to that prehuman thinking of which Cowper says :\u2014\n\" Reasoning at every step he treads, man yet mistakes his way, whilst\nmeaner things whom instinct leads, are rarely known to stray.\"\nHence, at Toy Farm, we have, I think, either a case of discovery\nby automatism, or else of accidental coincidence. In the latter con\nnection we may note that where water has not been found at one\nend of a property it might be natural for a dowser, in the absence of\nanything to guide him, to try for it at the other end, where also the\npump at (p) may have suggested it.\nSince writing the foregoing I have heard from Mr. David Caplin,\nMessrs. Duke and Ockenden's foreman, who writes in reply to\ninquiries : \u2014\nNew Road, Buxteil, Noeember 27th, 1899.\nBy what I can remember about the well I sunk at Toy Farm, the chalk\ndown to about 60 ft. was of a very hard yellow nature with a lot of black\nflints. Below this for about 10ft. there were places where I should think\nwater had been passing through at one time. From 70 ft. to about 110 ft.\nthe chalk was in more of a block, but not so hard. The remainder of the\n1 Professor Barrett asks what a geologist would have done under the circum\nstances, He would hardly have sunk the old well another SO ft. to the nodular\nbeds in the \/\/. planus zone, as they are here too doubtfully water-bearing; and,\nfailing a damp place to drive on, the best plan would have been to drive from the\nbottom on the chance of cutting fissures. Water could so have been found, and the\nprobable quantity and cost computed from similar work in the district, as at the\nBrighton Waterworks.\n\fXXXVIII.] 337\nAppendix A.\n-^\nWe*\/ Weti\n^* .,,\u2022\u2022\u00ab. \\\n*-v> \" ... \\ ... \\ .\u00ab\u2022\u00bb'\nCi \"\u2022\u2022','\u2022\\ !TA\u00b1 HSfc^W \u2022 (\nN0Bfi| \\OldtYell\\\n.; \u2022\u2022..,..., \u00bb ' r\u00bb .

[part\nsinking was in a much whiter chalk with black veins in it, and we did not get\nany water till within about 2 ft. of the fissure, which I believe is about 6 ft.\nfrom the bottom of the well. There were two fissures coming into the well,\nnot opposite one another, but one I should think about due west and the\nother north-west, and there was no water coming from the east side at all.\nThis rather favours Tompkins' idea of springs meeting at a point\nthan mine of a main east and west fissure ; Mr. Pickard, however,\nmentions springs from opposite sides. The point could only be settled,\nif at all, by examining the well, which I was unable to do at the time\nof my visit owing to the obstacles of the pump and staging.\nCONCLUSION.\nOut of 21 cases of a water-supply obtained by means of a dowser,\nwhich I have now personally examined on the spot, there are, in my\nopinion, only three\u2014the three last described \u2014which may be called\nevidential of some supernormal faculty. To these may perhaps be\nadded the partial evidence at Melksham (No. 99) ; and at Warnham\nLodge (No. 58, described Vol. XIII., p. 279), where, though the bed\nwas known to be water-bearing, the dowser had, I found, succeeded\nin predicting a dry place. I have thus met with from three to five\ncases, or from 15 to 25 per cent., in which his success could not have\nbeen due to information normally acquired.\nIn the other cases, while the dowser may have known but a part\nof what I describe, I could seldom feel certain what he did or did not\nknow. From what I have seen of Somersetshire dowsers at work, I\nagree with Professor Barrett that they do not seek for information\u2014\nneither do they avoid it, and in the general conversation that ensues\nwhen the folks come out to see the water-finding it would be surprising\nif something was not said about existing water. Firmly believing in\nan external force moving the rod, the dowsers seek for water as one\nmight seek for iron with a compass, and a group of them over a\nparticular peg will confirm each other's indications with as much\nsatisfaction as if \" suggestion \" had never been heard of. But as\nProfessor Barrett has shown that the involuntary motion of the rod\nis due to unconscious suggestion, of normal or supernormal origin,\n\u2014the subconsciousness standing ready to act on the slightest hint\u2014\nwe must make sure that normal hints have been kept out of our experi\nments before we can use them as arguments for the supernormal. It\nseems to me, therefore, that most of the success in dowsing (say three-\nfourths) may be attributed to information reaching the dowser in a\nnormal way, the subconscious synthesis of which determines the\nmovement of the rod. The evidential fourth may be due to chance\ncoincidence, or to some yet undiscovered faculty.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix A. 339\nThe popular vogue which dowsing has obtained in this country,\nand which appears to be increasing, is due to something more than\nmere success. The involuntary but visible movement of the twig\ninspires the dowser with a confidence in himself, and his employers\nwith a confidence in him, that no amount of reasoning would. This\nconfidence in subconscious pronouncements, which is as old as humanity,\nimplies here a belief in some supernormal relation between the rod and\nwater. If existing, and involving the dowser's mind, my own opinion\nis that it is likely to show itself in the same way as other sub\nconscious faculty, i.e., fitfully and occasionally.\nIt is, I suppose, well within the mark to assume that three-fourths\nof most automatisms are subjective, i.e., revivals of memory, or dream\nlike imagination, and that one-fourth is a liberal estimate for the\nsupernormal. To suppose, then, that the supernormal element in\ndowsing, if such there be, will appear in any larger proportion, seems\nto me highly improbable. We may expect it to form a residuum\nwhich will be discovered only when, as in stellar parallax, many\nconcurrent causes have been eliminated. This is what I have\nattempted to do in this report.\nNote.\n[The foregoing able report by Mr. Westlake shows on the one\nhand the value of investigation on the spot by a competent geologist,\nand on the other how much easier it is to be wise after an event than\nbefore it. Moreover, with laudable anxiety to avoid any bias in\nfavour of the dowser, Mr. Westlake has no doubt gone to the opposite\nextreme. For he assumes the dowser possessed minute local and\nstratigraphical knowledge, had inspected all existing wells, and had\nability to draw inferences from all these data. These assumptions\nare not justified. The dowser, usually an ignorant man, is brought\ninto a district he has probably never seen before, he asks no questions,\nbut immediately sets to work perambulating the ground with his\nforked twig, and the whole business is over in a very short time.\nIf under similar conditions, and before opening the ground, a field\ngeologist would tell us whether the dowser's prediction is likely to be\nright or wrong, that would be a fairer test of whether the dowser's\nsuccess is mainly due to \" a sharp eye for the ground,\" and I hope\nthis test will be made by any who may have the opportunity. I\nagree, however, with the general conclusion arrived at by Mr. West-\nlake, but think that probably a larger percentage of the dowser's\nsuccess\u2014especially of certain dowsers\u2014is due to some cause at present\nunknown to science.\u2014W.

Westlake, F.G.S.\nThe mineralised ridge of the Mendip Hills just above the middle\nof the county has been the seat of mineral-dowsing since the time of\nQueen Elizabeth. The practice was probably introduced into Corn\nwall simultaneously, but has become practically extinct for this\npurpose in both localities. In Somersetshire, however, local conditions,\nfavouring the later application of the rod to water-finding, have pre\nserved its use to the present day. The Mendip itself consists of\npermeable Palaeozoic rocks\u2014Mountain Limestone on a core of old\nRed Sandstone\u2014in which the water for the most part sinks to too\ngreat a depth to be reached by wells. It is the Secondary rocks lying\nto the north and south\u2014the Trias, Lias, and Oolite\u2014forming what\nDe Ranee calls a \" supra-pervious \" series and yielding underground\nwater, which have determined that Somersetshire and not Cornwall\nshall be the centre of water-dowsing.\nThe two last (Jurassic), which occupy about half the area of the\ncounty, may be described as alternations of clays and limestones, the\nsand beds being few and subordinate. The Oolites, especially in\nthe upper part, consist of clays often of great thickness, alternating\nwith massive limestones forming reservoirs in which it is compara\ntively easy for a geologist to predict water ; although even here,\nthe limestones being well consolidated, success where quantity is\nrequired may depend upon the accidental striking of a water-bearing\nfissure.\nIn the Lower Lias, which forms most of the low-lying arable land\nof the county, clays and limestones alternate every few feet or inches,\nand are alike impermeable, as De Ranee indeed terms the whole\nformation. When uncovered in the quarries they are seen, however,\nto be traversed by cracks and occasional faults, like much-skated-upon\nice, which allow of a slow percolation and the storage of small bodies\nof water. 1 There is no record of any copious supply, and the finding\neven of a domestic supply depends on a chance meeting with these\nwater-bearing joints of which there is no sign at the surface. This,\nwhich is the geologist's extremity, is the dowser's opportunity ; or, in\n1 Water not only sinks through the Lias, but rises through it, as in the springs of\nBath and Cheltenham.\n\fxxxvm.] Appendix B. 341\nother words, it is not surprising that where common-sense ends, the\nuncommon-sense attributed to the dowser should be in demand. The\nwater, it is true, is sometimes impure, the fissured character of the\nformation being more favourable to pollution near farms or villages\nthan to purification. Thus at the town of Somerton the well water\nwas analysed by the Rivers Pollution Commission and found to be\nnearly all dangerously polluted.1\nWe may note, moreover, that dowsing is not carried on on the\nSomersetshire moorlands, which comprise the high-lying impermeable\nDevonian areas of Exmoor and the Quantocks drained by surface\nstreams, and the low-lying alluvial levels debouching on the Bristol\nChannel where water lies near the surface. Cornwall also consists of\npalaeozoic clay-slate (\" killas \") with granite and other igneous rocks,\nall of which throw off the water, except the little that percolates in\nfissures.\nThere are two main types of underground water\u2014what may be\ntermed bed-water, or seepage, filtering through the pores of beds ; a\nand fissure-water, or drainage, flowing through their joints. 8 The\nfirst type characterises permeable beds, the second the impermeable.\nTo the latter condition the consolidation due to ages tends to bring\nall the aqueous rocks ; all the igneous are so from the time of cooling :\n1 The local dowser, however, an old farmer, ha9 proved equal to the occasion,\nand guarantees a pure supply by \" andalyzing \" the water, as he terms it, by means\nof two twigs held simultaneously.\n2 There is no English term for this : \"interstitial water,\" or \" quarry-water,\" is\nproperly the water held in the capillary pores of a rock and not expelled short of dry\ning. The Scotch dialect word, seepage, is, however, used in the United States to\ndesignate the water that soaks through and oozes from the soil, and is so employed\nby Mr. King (see under). It has the sense of oozagc, and contrasts with drainage\n(water flowing freely in non-capillary channels).\n8 The movement of underground water, or ground water as it is called (Germ.\nOrundwasser), has just been elaborately treated in two papers by Messrs.

The motion of water in the\npores of beds, typically sands and sandstones, is very thoroughly discussed both from\nthe experimental side and from the mathematical laws of capillarity. The authors\nallow, however, that their conclusions are radically modified by the occurrence of\nfissures, and that the actual motion of the water is very different from what it would\nbe in homogeneous beds in which percolation proceeded through the pores\nalone. Thus, in the Dakota artesian basin, which consists of Cretaceous sands\nand sandstones particularly favourable for the storage and transmission of water, Mr.\nKing shows that the largest theoretical seepage, or capillary flow, is only one-sixth of\nthe observed flow (Ibid., p. 249), so that about 80 per cent. must take place through\nfissures. In less permeable beds this proportion is probably largely exceeded. Thus,\nin a flume of the West Los Angelos Water Company, the observed flow exceeded the\nlargest capillary computed nearly tenfold {Ibid., p. 255). Mr. Slichter appends a\nlist of 79 papers on the subject, chiefly in German.\n\f342 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nsuch rocks are seen in the Palaeozoic of Cornwall, Wales, the Lake\ndistrict, etc. 1\nBed-water is the more usual form, in the sense of being the one\nmost met with in the populated lowlands. But as we pass from the\nlooser rocks in the south-eastern counties to the more consolidated in\nthe west, the proportion of fissure-water increases, till in the moun\ntains there is nothing else. Tending to keep in compartments, it is\ndifficult for a geologist to predict its level, and still more its exact\nplace or quantity. In these Palaeozoic districts, however, surface\nwater is usually abundant and good, and the dowser is superfluous ;\nand so also in the Tertiary where the rocks hold only bed-water.\nHis happy hunting ground lies therefore, as we have seen, in the\nintermediate conditions of the Secondary rocks, such as exist in\nSomersetshire.\nE. W.\n1 An illustration from Llanelly is furnished by Mr. J. F. Young, who says in a\nletter to Professor Barrett :\u2014\" In the Coal Measures exposed in a new dock near here\nnumerous springs have been intersected, issuing with considerable force through\nfissures in the rock, some of which were horizontal whilst others were vertical. In a\nnew coal pit they are sinking near my residence I noticed the same thing, showing\nbeyond dispute that underground water in this and similar districts does circulate\nthrough fissures, or follows the dip of the strata, and that intervening portions at\nsome distance below the surface may be quite dry. \"\n\fXXXVIII.] 343\nAppendix G.\nAPPENDIX C.\nUse of the Eod in the Search fok Mineral Lodes.\nOwing to the length to which the present Report has grown, I have\nbeen compelled to postpone the publication of the mass of evidence\nFio. 21.\nFrovi (1.

As already mentioned, this use goes back to a period long\n\f344 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nanterior to the first employment of the rod in the search for under\nground water. The introduction of the virgida diviria, or, as it should\nbe called, virgulafurcata, into England took place, I have little doubt,\nin the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when German miners were brought\nover to develop the mineral wealth of Cornwall. They appear to have\nbrought with them their scldag-ruthe (striking-rod) \u2014our modern\nforked divining-rod\u2014-and the phrase \" striking \" the vein, now extended\nto \"striking\" oil, etc., is probably a survival in modern English of the\nterm used by these old German miners. The word \"dowsing-rod \" is,\nI venture to think,\u2014with all deference to my philological friends,\u2014\nthe translation of schlag-rulhe into middle English. (See note to p. 135.)\nOn p. 343 is a picture (Fig. 21) of these German miners at work\nwith their virgula furcata. It is taken from the edition published\nat Basle in 1546 of the great folio on mining, De re Metallica, by\nG. Agricola. Successive scenes are shown in one picture : at A the\ndowser is traversing the ground ; at B he has struck ore, which\non digging is subsequently found and pointed out by two overseers.\nThe cutting of the rod from a willow is seen on the right. The\nserious, business-like air of the men holding the rod is evident ; this\nis also apparent in another woodcut to be found in an edition of\nSebastian Munster's Cosmography, published in 1 550. These are the\nearliest authentic descriptions and representations of the modern\nforked divining rod that I have been able to discover.1 Another early\npicture of dowsing for minerals (from a rare Italian work on mining)\nis given on p. 345 ; a photograph was taken by permission from the\ncopy in the British Museum.\nFrom Cornwall the use of the rod spread to the lead mines in the\nMendips, and in the 17th century it was widely employed in the\nsearch for ore in that district of Somersetshire. Billingsley, in his\nGeneral View of Somerset, published in 1797, gives a lengthy account of\nits use and of the esteem in which the rod was held in his time for the\ndiscovery of lead ore. But as the mines became exhausted the\ndowsers found employment in the search for underground water. A few\ni Chevreul and other writers attribute the earliest description of the rod to the\nalchemist who went by the name of Basil Valentine, quoting a passage from his\nLetztes Testament, in which the use of the rod (schlag-ruthe) in the search for ore\nis described, and erroneously giving a date in the 15th century for that work. The\nfirst edition of Basilius Valentinus. . . His Last Will and Testament was dated\n1657, and translated from Fratris B.V. . . Gcheime Bucher oder letzes Testament\n(1645). Mr. Westlake tells me that this is abridged from Bergwerckschatz, etc.\n(1618), edited in 1600 by Elias Montanus, a physician of Brieg, in Silesia. The\nauthorship is attributed in a concluding poem to Nicolaus Soleas, but whether\n\u2014as an MS. note on the title-page of the copy in the British Museum says\u2014\n\"genuinus Autor hj libri fuit, \" is uncertain. This earlier work describes the\nschlag-ruthe and other rods at much greater length.\n\f'xxxvm.] 345\nAppendix C.\nFio. 22.\nFrom M. A.

[pakt\nSomerset dowsers still use the rod in the search for lead and zinc ore,\nand it was important to make a strict experimental test of such\ndowsers,\u2014under the supervision of a competent geologist,\u2014before\nthey disappeared altogether. Mr. Westlake, F.G.S., kindly undertook\nto do this for me, and the authorities of the Friends' school at Sidcot\ngenerously placed their grounds at our disposal for this purpose. The\nfollowing Report gives the result of Mr. Westlake's experiments with\nthe different dowsers he employed. Some of these, however, were\nwater, and not mineral dowsers. This should be borne in mind in\nreading the Report, for if the detection of surface indications affords\nan explanation of the dowser's success, as some maintain, then the\nresults obtained with dowsers unaccustomed to search for mineral ore\nought not to show greater success than chance coincidence would\naccount for, whereas the report shows that they do.\nEXPERIMENTS IN MINERAL-DOWSING AT SIDCOT.\nBy E. Westlake, F.G.S.\nDowsing for mineral in the Mendips has been practised, as we know\nfrom various historical notices, for the past 250 years. On visiting, in\nthe course of an inquiry into water-dowsing in 1899, the mining\nvillages towards the western end of the hills, I found that mining\noperations had ceased some eighteen or twenty years back. I inter\nviewed one or two of the old dowsers still living, who had used\ntheir art in former times, but found it was not now possible to obtain\ndetails or verification of the circumstances.\nThe only course open seemed therefore to be to make fresh trials\nwith those dowsers who professed themselves able to find mineral.\nSeveral acres of land in the neighbourhood of Winscombe belonging\nto a Friends' school, which, while known to be mineralised, had not\nbeen mined, offered a favourable spot for experiment. I accordingly\nwent over the ground with four dowsers independently, viz.:\u2014\n(1) Thomas Day, of Shipham, an old mining dowser, who professes\nto be able to find lodes, not necessarily mineralised.\n(2) Rowland Pavey, a young miller of Cheddar, who professes to\nfind underground objects by some secret art ; (had not found mineral).\n(3) Thomas Foord, a labourer of Shipham, an inexperienced dowser.\n(4) William Kerslake, of Wells, a tailor and professional water-\nfinder ; (had never searched for minerals before).\nTho localities tried were within a space of 300 yards east and west,\nand 100 yards north and south, and comprised :\u2014\n(a) An old cricket field west of the school, at a quarry in which\nore had been found some twenty years since by Thomas Day.\n(b) Some ground in and adjoining the girls' tennis court.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix G. 347\n(c) A burial ground in which ore had been found in 1866, and a\ngarden adjoining.\n(d) A ploughed field a little to the north.\nThe soil at these places is mostly thin ; the underlying rock is the\nDolomitic Conglomerate at the base of the Trias, which consists of\npebbles of various Palaeozoic rocks, the whole weathering reddish, and\nhaving a southerly dip of a few degrees. The rock is traversed by\noccasional lodes and veins, nearly vertical, running east and west, and\ncarrying the ores of lead, zinc, iron, and manganese, but they are\nhere too thin to have been worth mining.\nThe points indicated by each dowser separately I marked in\nsuch a way as to be imperceptible to those who came after, and\nI also so arranged that they did not have an opportunity of\ncommunicating with one another. I went round with each dowser,\nbut except in a general way I did not know where the previous\nmarks were, and therefore sources of error from conscious or un\nconscious collusion may be considered excluded. With each dowser\nthe twig turned over a space of a yard or two, corresponding\nprobably with their ideas of the width of the lodes, and I\nmarked the central points. Pavey indicated 5 places, Day 28,\nFoord 2, and Kerslake 26. The marks are numbered consecutively\n1 to 61 on the accompanying plan, and the dowsers who indicated\nthem are distinguished for brevity by an initial, e.g., P3 = mark No. 3\nindicated by Pavey (see plan on p. 350).\nAt seven places two of the dowsers approximately coincided within\ndistances varying from 1^ ft. to 8 ft. Two of these, adjoining the\ntennis court, I found to be in made ground, and did not open up on\naccount of the expense. Of the other five I opened, one in the field\nand one in the garden showed only solid rock ; in the remaining\nthree we found a well-defined vein of ore.\nAt three other single marks I opened up there was no sign of ore,\nthough at one or two Mr. Clark thought there were signs of a lode.1\nIn reckoning the dowsers' success their marks should be taken as\nextending a yard on either side the centre.\nThe results are given on the next page in tabular form.\nAt No. 4, though Kerslake's mark, K 56, was 4 ft. south of the\nvein, it was only 2 ft. from the south wall (foot wall) of the lode, and\n1 ft. from the buff coloration due to the same, and was hence a practi\ncal success. Day's mark 3 ft. further south is neither a success nor\naltogether a failure ; it may perhaps reckon as half successful.

The\ndowser Day was aware that ore had been found in one of the graves,\nand after he had made his marks I asked him to point it out, but he\ncould not identify it. He might, of course, have retained some latent\nmemory of its whereabouts ; still as the gravestones are small, uniform\nin size, and flat on the ground, and hence neither legible nor\ndistinctive 12 yds. away, I was interested to find on plotting the\nplan that his mark, D 33, was exactly on the straight line, 18 yds.\nlong, joining the No. 4 vein with W. Tanner's grave.\nAt this point (No. 5) I opened the ground to verify the lode, and\nfound it running just north of D 33 towards a point 2 or 3 yds. north\nof the grave aforesaid. Clark said it was \"very promising lead-bearing\nground,\" and, on sinking in it to a depth of 4 ft., we struck the vein.\nDay's mark was 1 J ft. south of the foot wall, and 3ft. south of the\nvein\u2014another success. Kerslake's mark, K 58, was 6 ft. further\nsouth ; so that, taking the two sides of the hedge, each dowser made\none decided success and one doubtful one.\nTaking the success of individual dowsers, Day, the miner, was right\nin 1\\ places out of 5 ( = one half). As he had in former years seen\nthe ore at the adjoining points, and knew the general run of the lodes,\nit may be said that his memory, conscious or subconscious, may have\ncaused the twig to turn at the right places; and this view is\nfavoured by the circumstance that in the garden, which was quite shut\noff by the hedge from any view of the burial ground, he was 5 ft. off\nthe lode. Still, in making this criticism, we should bear in mind that\none of the uses\u2014according to Day, the chief use\u2014of dowsing in\npractical mining, is to \" pick up \" the \" lode \" or \" course \" of mineral\nat no great distance from its working face, and that this he did at\nNos. 9 and 33 with absolute accuracy, and of course without the ore\nbeing in the least visible anywhere. Mr. Knight told me that ore had\nalso been found at the school at the S.W. corner of the inner court,\nnear D 27, but I have not reckoned this anything for Day, not know\ning how far he knew the circumstances.\nKerslake, the tailor from Wells, a comparative stranger to the\nplace, was right in \\\\ places out of 5 (= one-third nearly); I may\nhave told him that ore had been found in the burial ground, but\nbeyond this his success was not derived from local knowledge.\nPavey had a partial success at P 3 where he was 6 ft. off the vein,\nbut in the two other holes dug on his sole indication there was nothing\n\f350 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nFio. 23.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix G. 351\nwhatever, unless we reckon Clark's opinion about P 4. His propor\ntion of success was thus one-sixth.\nAmong general objections which may be taken to these experiments,\nwhich I could only do quickly and extempore, are : (1) that the ground\nwas known to be mineralised : (2) that the miner Day, having formerly\ndowsed over the property, refused to waste time by trying over the\nnorthern or southern portions (he made, however, one N. and S.\ntraverse of the cricket field without result) ; (3) that to save the time\nof the other dowsers and with a view to getting coincidences I took\nthem over the same ground ; (4) that, by way of encouraging them, I\nmentioned to one or other that ore had been found in the quarry or\nburial ground, and must therefore assume it known to all. While\nsuch points make it difficult to calculate whether the success exceeds\nchance or local knowledge, I am inclined to think that it does.\nThe probable result of opening the ground at haphazard may be\njudged to some extent by the section exposed in the turnpike road,\nwhich lies in a cutting several feet deep for twice the distance shown\non the plan, but shows a lode only at one place opposite the quarry.\nIt is also practically certain that the discovery of the mineral lodes\ndid not depend on any surface indications, as both in the cricket field,\ngarden, and burial ground, there was a layer of turf or vegetable soil\nover and completely concealing the lode.\nThese experiments in their practical success and in the difficulty of\nproving more, are in a line with ordinary water-dowsing. They are, I\nthink, a further illustration of the power of the automatic mind to\ngather and utilise information from all sources. What these sources\nare can only be settled by more systematic trials, which should if\npossible take the form of tracing known objects, the chances of finding\nwhich can be calculated. Such are, e.g., water pipes, gas pipes, electric\nwires, and subways carrying water or mineral.1 An old German\nmining-book describes the twig as used to find where to sink a shaft\nfrom the surface of the ground to some particular point in the mine.\nWith known objects all the dowsers' predictions can be checked, which\nis impossible where, as in the above experiments, each point has to be\nopened up. Opening the ground to find unknown objects is not only\nexpensive but inconclusive, as the dowser may always maintain that\nthe object will be found at a greater depth.\nE. W.\n1 Mr. Pavey is, I understand, prepared to trace underground objects of any kind ;\nhe has succeeded, I am told by Mr. M. P. Porch. Magdalen, Oxford, in finding\nhuman and mammalian fossils in the Cheddar Caves beyond the result of chance\nexcavation.\n\f352 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nAPPENDIX D.\nParamelle.\nThe story of the Abb6 Paramelle and his extraordinary success as\na water-finder (or hydroscope as he was called) is so little known in\nEngland that it is worthy of more than a passing notice. Paramelle\nwas born in 1790, and in 1818 was appointed cure and afterwards\nAbb\u00e9 of St. Jean L'Espinasse, moving from there to St. Cer\u00e9 in the\nDepartment of Lot in the south-west of France. A man of keen obser\nvation and scientific spirit, he was struck with the remarkable difference\nbetween the numerous springs, streams, and well-watered area of the\neastern half of the Department and the difficulty with which water\nwas obtained in the twenty-four arid cantons of the western half.\nHere the population were impoverished by having to expend a large\npart of their time in laboriously carrying water from distant wells to\nsupply the wants of their families and their cattle. Prompted, he\ntells us, by charitable feelings, he spent two years in the fruitless\nsearch for springs, in the hope that he might be able to supply the\npoor folk of the arid region with the benediction of a bountiful water\nsupply. In this he failed, and got the reputation of searching for the\nquantities of buried treasure which the English were supposed to have\nleft behind when long ago they evacuated that district. He then set to\nwork to compare the geological characteristics and rainfall in the two\nregions ; the arid part was calcareous, but had the same rainfall. The\nsprings, he rightly conjectured, were only due to the rainfall ; where,\nthen, did the rainfall go to in the arid region ? It must penetrate\nthe soil and accumulate, ultimately making its way underground to\nthe river valleys. Guided by his own observations, Paramelle was\ngradually led to put his theories to the test, and found them verified.\nHe then travelled further afield, and at lost he tells us that after nine\nyears of exploration and observation he felt sufficient confidence to go to\nwhat we should now call the County Council of the Department of Lot\nand ask them to place a certain sum at his disposal to test his theories\nby sinking wells in certain places where he predicted water would be\nfound in the arid communes. The Council acceded, and in 1827\ngranted him a sum of 600 francs to make experiments, the communes\nthat were benefited to contribute an equal sum. Eight places were\nselected by Paramelle in as many communes, but it was considered at\nthat time so impossible to find water in these calcareous plateaux that\nthree communes refused to incur the expense, though five who did\nwere in each case rewarded by an abundant supply.\n\fxxxvm.] Appendix D. 353\nIn the proces verbal of the Council of the Department of Lot for\n1829 these remarkable successes are recorded. Paramelle, \u2014now the\nlearned savant, M. l'Abbe' Paramelle,\u2014 is called in to explain his\ntheories, and a further sum of two thousand francs placed at his\ndisposal and a generous recognition paid to his learning and self-\nsacrificing devotion. Two years later the Council record that in\nsixteen out of seventeen localities the predictions of Paramelle had\nbeen verified, a perennial water supply being found at the place, depth,\nand of the volume he had indicated. His fame becoming known,\napplications to find water in waterless districts poured in to such an\nextent that with his Bishop's permission he relinquished his ecclesiastic\nduties and became what we should now call a hydro-geologist, what\nhe called a \"geognostic,\" and the public of that day a hydroscope.\nDisclaiming the infallibility which was thrust upon him, the local\nnewspaper accounts of the period, some of which I have read, all\nspeak of his modesty and marvellous success. Many explain his\nsecret as a gift of God, others as the work of the devil. The poor\npeople, however, answered very much in the words of the blind man\ncured by our Lord, \" Whether he be a sorcerer or a messenger of\nGod we know not ; this we know, that whereas we were perishing for\nwant of water, now by his help we have an abundance.\" By per\nmission of the authorities, Paramelle hereafter made a fixed and\nmodest charge of ten to forty-five francs for his services in each case,\nexcept to the poor, to whom no charge was made (I am afraid this\nwould not satisfy our English water-finders, whether geologists or\ndowsers), and for twenty-one years he spent from sunrise to sunset\nevery day, except Sundays, for nine months in every year at the work\nof water-finding.\nIn 1843 the proces verbal of the Council General of Lot records\nthat in their department alone 338 wells had been dug at places\nindicated by Paramelle, and, of these, 305, or 90 per cent., yielded an\nabundant supply of potable water, in every case found at the depth he\nhad predicted. In other parts he had also found 683 sources of water\nsupply ; and when in 1854, at the age of 64, he practically gave up his\nactive work, the Abbe asserts that in 25 years he had located over\n10,000 sources of underground water, and he estimated that between\n8 and 9,000 wells had been dug at the sites he had selected. He\nendeavoured to find out the percentage of failures he had had, but iu\nspite of circulars he sent out, got very few replies; he believes, however,\nthat his failures were under 5 per cent. of his total trials. Whether\n5 per cent. or 10 per cent., as the above official records indicate from his\nentire results, his astonishing success is, I venture to think, beyond\nanything I have heard modern expert geologists claim. A remarkable\ntestimony to the value of his work I found in an old number of the\n2 c\n\f354 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nJournal a\"Agriculture Pratique for April 1845. The Journal quotes a\nletter the Prefect of Lot wrote to the Prefect of Versailles, stating\nthat up to that time about 6,000 new sources of water supply in 30\ndepartments had been discovered by the Abb\u00e9 Paramelle, and the\nactual money value of the springs thus found was, he says, estimated\nat not less than four to five million francs.\nIn 1846 the Acade'mie of Reims published a report in their\nComptes Rendus from a committee of six of their members appointed\nto enquire into Paramelle's theory and work. In this lengthy and\ncareful report the committee express their high opinion of Paramelle's\ncharacter and the results of his work, and quote a number of letters\nand certificates from various officials in different parts of France,\ntestifying to his success. His proportion of failures is estimated as\nrather less than 5 'per cent. In almost every instance quoted, the depth\nat which water was found was under 50 feet. As to his theory, the\ncommittee report that, though true in a sense, it is imperfect and not\nalways applicable, nor do they consider that a knowledge of it would\nenable another, not possessed of Paramelle's special talents, quick\nrecognition of all surface indications and long practice, to be equally\nsuccessful. Paramelle himself declared, however, that in a few months\nof study and three of field practice, he could teach anyone of ordinary\nintelligence all that he knew. That might be, but he could not\ncommunicate his almost unerring instinct.1\nParamelle, however, unlike most prophets, seems to have had more\nhonour in his own country than elsewhere. His success was declared\nby outsiders to be impossible, doubt was thrown on the reality or per\nmanence of the springs he had found, one savant asserts that his\nprocedure was unscientific and valueless, whilst a writer in one of\nthe French journals, for 1842, says whatever success he had was due\nto impressions, sensations, and convulsions, and, doubtless, diabolic\nvisions that he experienced. This writer adds: \"The only difference\nbetween Paramelle and other sorcerers is that he conceals the diabolic\nsigns he receives, glossing over his magical proceedings with a lot of\nscientific jargon.\" 2\n1 M. Auscher, in his recent handbook of hydro-geology (L'Art de dicov-vrir les\nSources; Paris, 1899), states that the best known of Paramelle's pupils was M. Amy\nde Pannessieres, who also wrote upon the discovery of underground water. But I\ndo not know of his writings nor of any record of his success as a water-finder.\nM. Auscher refers repeatedly to Paramelle's work and successes, although his\ntheory is said to have been found in part defective or erroneous. Some of Paramelle's\noccasional failures M. Auscher attributes to his neglect of surface indications,\nsuch as the comparatively rapid melting of snow over underground water, local\nmists, the character of the vegetation, etc., but of some at least of these\nParamelle was aware, and it is difficult to know to what extent he did neglect or\nrely on them in practice.\n2 L'Eclairtur du Midi, Juillet, 1842.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix D. 355\nTo meet his critics Paramelle determined to publish the methods\nwhich had guided him. He states that in 1827 he had written a\nwork \"on the art of discovering springs.\" This he revised and\npublished in 1856 ; three editions were quickly sold, a German trans\nlation was made by the Professor of Geology in Freiberg, a Spanish\ntranslation followed, and so highly was the work esteemed that the\nSpanish Ministry ordered every municipality to purchase a copy. A\nfourth enlarged French edition was published in 1896, after Paramelle's\ndeath. This I have read, and if the earlier ones resemble it, I do not\nhesitate to express my amazement at the neglect of this work in\nEngland. The wealth of geological and useful practical knowledge\ngained, through field observation, by this French Abb\u00e9 two generations\nago is astonishing. He must have been an odd mixture, for he\nincludes in his work a number of laudatory press notices. l From\nthese, however, we gain a description by eye-witnesses of his method\nof procedure ; and these merit some attention. First, there is the\nunimpeachable evidence of one of the most distinguished French\nsavants, M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, who, in a memoir read before the\nParis Academy of Sciences, in 1836, writes as follows:\u2014 \"The Abb\u00e9\nParamelle's skill in discovering springs rests on the science of observa\ntion, and not on the instinctive movement of the divining rod. He\nhas acquired by practice such acuteness of observation that, after a\nsingle and rapid inspection of the surface of the ground, he can\nindicate the place and the depth of any underground sources that may\nexist. His success has been so remarkable as to convince the most\nincredulous.\" Nearly every eye-witness says the same thing. A\nJournal at Aix says that, \" Without any hesitation, and after a rapid\nglance, Paramelle at once indicates not only the very spot where to\nsink a well, but the depth it will have to be sunk and the volume of\nwater that will be obtained. All this in so laconic and precise a\nfashion that scepticism vanishes.\" Another journal, Le Rhutenoia,\nwrites, on February 15th, 1837 :\u2014\"The Abbe' Paramelle simply looks\nround, says, ' Here you will find the spring at such a depth and of\nsuch quantity ; it comes in this direction, and the water will be of\nsuch and such a quality ' \" ; and so on, in upwards of a score of other\nPress notices which are included in the chapters XXX. and XXXI.\nof Paramelle's work. Similar testimony is borne in the Report of the\n1 It is possible that some of these laudatory notices were inserted after Paramelle's\ndeath by the editor of the fourth and last edition, the only edition I have been able\nto consult. This contains the preface to the third edition, published in 18G5 ; in this\npreface, which Paramelle himself wrote, he states that in spite of some hostile\ncriticism, none of his statements have been controverted, and after exercising the\ngreatest care in revision, he has found nothing essential to withdraw. Hence, he adds,\nthe present (third) edition is merely a reproduction of the earlier ones with some\nadditional facts and quotations which support the conclusions he had reached.\n2 c 2\n\f356 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nCommission appointed by the Academy of Reims already referred to,\nand in a paper published in 1835 by the French Society Central*\nd'Agriculture, LVIP Cahier, p. 326.1\nThe last chapter of Paramelle's book gives a very interesting\nsummary of the various methods that had been adopted in ancient and\nin modern times (i.e., before the present century) for the purpose of\ndiscovering underground water ; to this part of our subject we may\nreturn later.\nWhat then was the secret of Paramelle's method ? This he has\ndisclosed, or professed to disclose, in his book, L'Arl de De'couvrir Its\nSources. He did not use any form of divining-rod ; he tells us the\nrod would never turn in his hands, though he had often tried it, and\nhe regarded the users of the baguette with undisguised contempt.\nThe hypothesis upon which he worked, to state it in the most\ngeneral form, was that underground water behaves precisely like\nwater that is visible on the surface of the earth. Just as in the latter\ncase waters that are precipitated upon the surface of the earth and\nfail to penetrate the superficial soil, gather into rivulets and join\nstreams and rivers, following in their course certain suitable channels,\nso must underground waters behave. Thus the waters which percolate\nthrough the upper earth, on reaching a bed of impermeable rock or\nclay, will form into little filaments of water, these will unite into\nrivulets, which again will join larger subterranean water courses, and\nso on until they finally reach the surface or possibly emerge in the bed\nof a river or lake. Throughout their course they will follow hollows,\ndepressions or folds in the impermeable stratum analogous to those\nin which surface waters flow. The position of these underground\nchannels, our author asserts, can be determined by observation of\nthe surface. This branch of his subject Paramelle explains with\nmuch detail, but it will be sufficient here to give a bare outline of\nhis views.\nSubject to certain exceptions, it may be said that he held the\nconformation of the surface to correspond in some important features\nwith that of an impermeable stratum beneath it. A valley or longi\ntudinal depression, whether large or small, marks, he says, the position\nof an underground stream. In broad valley bottoms the principal\nwatercourse will usually be found on the line of intersection of the\nsides. Subsidiary gullies or hollows indicate the affluents. In a fairly\nlevel country, where the depressions can be only slightly marked, he\ndescribes how it is still possible with minute precautions and by close\nobservation to detect them.\n1 For these and other rare papers relating to Paramelle I am indebted to\nM. Holland, of 2, Rue des Chantiers, Paris, whoso excellent book agency I have\npreviously had to thank.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix D. 357\nThe existence of such outward signs of hidden streams of water\nParamelle attributes to the natural tendency of the surface to conform\nto its supporting bed, and also to subsidence due to the constant\ncarrying away of matter by the underground current.\nThe quantity of water likely to be found at a selected point he\nestimated from the area drained. The quality of the water he inferred\nfrom the nature of the soil through which it had filtered, and the\ndepth at which it ran mainly from ordinary geologic data.\nParamelle did not claim that his method was applicable to the\ndiscovery of sheets of underground water or water-logged strata of\nwide area, or, one may suppose, to water at a great depth. The\nformer case, however, he believed to be of very rare occurrence, and\nto others, for which his general plan would be unsuitable, he refers\ncandidly, and suggests several ingenious considerations.1\nIt may be inferred, from the foregoing brief sketch of Paramelle's\nviews, as well as from the contemporary notices of his work, that his\nsuccess lay in the discovery of shallow, or what are sometimes called\nsurface, wells, that is, wells from 10 to 30 or 40 feet deep, and his\nobservations are evidently based on the superficial beds which lie on\nthe older rocks. As Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., has pointed out in the\ninteresting letter I have already published,2 \" This perception of\nwater-bearing surface beds is quite independent of a knowledge of\ngeological structure. Indeed the rise of geology as a science tended to\nput this older knowledge of water-bearing surface beds into the back\nground. The Geological Survey had been at work man)' years at the\ndeep-seated geology of England and Wales, before any ' drift-maps,'\nor those showing these superficial beds, were even thought of. .\n1 Mr. B. St. G. Lefroy, to whom I am indebted for kindly making, at my\nrequest, the foregoing concise summary of Paramelle's working hypothesis, writes to\nme as follows:\u2014\"Paramelle's theory can hardly have been developed, ex post facto,\nto disarm the popular superstition which his abnormal success created, for in 1 829 a\nlocal French journal (quoted on p. 382 of Paramelle's work) states that his success\nwas based on geological theories he had arrived at, and the local newspaper reports\nemphasise the fact that he viewed the land, in some cases not going on it at all.\n\"The impression which he makes on me is that, granting his premises, his\nconclusions are drawn with admirable common-sense and candour ; and that even if\nhe be a scientific heretic, twenty-five years of observation, a naturally good eye for\nground and some modicum of truth in his conjectures, might well account for his\nsuccesses without invoking any supernormal faculties.\n\"The gist of the difference between Paramelle and orthodox geologists, I venture\n(with the deference of conscious ignorance) to submit lies in the question :\u2014Is a\nwater-bearing stratum a sponge or a filter\"! (I mean principally. Of course it must be\nboth to some extent). If the latter, would not his view be correct\u2014ex necessitate rei f\n(Water would percolate by gravity into depressions). Another way of contrasting\nParamelle and hydro-geologists might be to say that the former fixed his mind on the\nimpermeable stratum while the attention of the latter is mainly directed (I think) to\nthe presence or absence of a water-soaked bed above it.\nsProcecdiiw S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 222.\n\f358 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nBut geologists seldom bestow much thought on these various drift-beds\nunless interested in flint implements.\" Perhaps I may here add paren\nthetically my earnest hope that good \"drift-maps\" of the whole of\nthe British Isles will soon be published by the Geological Survey. The\nneed for and practical value of such maps has been most strongly\nimpressed upon me during these investigations. Both Mr. Kilroe and\nMr. Holmes have pointed out to me how misleading the ordinary\nmaps may be to a person who wishes to obtain a moderate water\nsupply by sinking a well.\nI am not in the least competent to give any opinion upon Para-\nmelle's theories. They may excite a smile among geologists of the\npresent day, or they may awaken interest or arouse criticism. In any\ncase, his phenomenal success in the location of underground water\nneeds explanation, even assuming that he did not discover the more\nabundant sources found in deep wells. For my own part, I believe\nthat the experience he had gained by long observation in the field,\nand the instinct he had thus acquired, accounted for a good deal more\nthan he could rationally explain. Hence, like the successful dowser\nof past and present times, it was his sub-conscious far more than his\nconscious life that was concerned in the process of water-finding. That\nno mere knowledge of the theories he sets forth in his book will enable\nany one to become a second Paramelle is obvious from the fact that,\nalthough his book has been widely read on the Continent during the\nlast seventy years, no such renown has been subsequently gained by\nany Continental water-finder, nor, I believe, by hydro-geologists any\nwhere, as attached to this simple-minded French Abb&\n\fxxxvm.] Appendix E. 359\nAPPENDIX E.\nEvidence of Clairvoyance in Dowsers.\nIt is obvious that if a good dowser has any power whatever of\nsubconscious supersensory perception, surface indications of the object\nsought for will have very little to do with his success, and he\nought to be able to tell the position of a hidden coin or any buried\nobject as well as that of underground water and mineral lodes. Now\nit is well known that the majority of dowsers from the earliest times\nhave always asserted that they could do this ; in fact, the first use of\nthe divining rod was for the purpose of discovering buried treasure.1\nIt would take me too far aside from my present purpose if I entered\ninto the history of this part of my subject and the evidence that\nexists on its behalf ; this I propose to do in another paper. It is\nsufficient to say that I have collected a large amount of evidence\nwhich shows,\u2014in spite of my strong previous belief to the contrary,\u2014\nthat the success of the dowser in finding concealed objects is greater\nthan seems possible to account for by chance coincidence. Indications\nmay in some cases have been unconsciously afforded by those present\nwho knew where the object was hidden, but, allowing for this and\nother sources of error, there appears to be in these experiments a\ndegree of success with certain good dowsers like the late John\nMullins that points to the existence of some faculty analogous to\nclairvoyance.- With several amateur dowsers there is similar evidence.\nMr. Tosswill, of Budleigh Salterton (see p. 223), made in the presence\nof two witnesses a series of successful experiments in finding con\ncealed coins, every care being taken to avoid unconscious indications\n1 There is an amusing account in the life of William Lilly, the astrologer, of how\nhe accompanied Davy Ramsey, \"his Majesty's clockniaker,\" in the year 1834, to\nsearch for buried treasure by means of the divining rod iu the cloisters of West\nminster Abbey, the Dean having given permission, and how the demons raised a\nstorm and drove them away. One of the epigrams of Sheppard, published in 1651,\nsatirises this use of the rod ; but Continental and, to a less extent, English, literature\nof that and an earlier period, contains frequent reference to the use of the rod for\nfinding buried treasure. Even so recently as September 28th, 1882, the Paris corre\nspondent of the London Times relates how the Government Director of Fine Arts\nin Paris had that week ordered, in his official capacity, a search for treasure (sup\nposed to have been buried a century previously), to be made by means of the divining\nrod. The search was, however, fruitless. A leading article on the subject appeared\nin the Times for October 6th, 1882.\n* a few cases were cited in the previous Report. See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.\nXIII., pp. 78, 82, 84, 85, 94, etc.\n\f360 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nbeing given by the witnesses. I have specially to thank Mr. Tosswill\nfor his kindness in assisting this inquiry, and taking a railway journey\nof four hours solely for the purpose of enabling these tests to be made.\nMr. Young, of Llanelly (see p. 221) has made similar experiments\nin the presence of a previously sceptical witness. Mr. Jerman,\nF.R.I B.A., a well-known architect in Exeter, who is an amateur\ndowser, found he also was successful on making an attempt at finding\na carefully concealed coin, though one such experiment is of little\nvalue. Enough evidence, however, exists to make it worth while\nfor those who find they have the power of motor automatism\nto pursue somewhat similar experiments, and I hope this will\nbe done.\nI regret that I have not made more experiments of this kind myself\nwith different dowsers. The fact is, I was for a long time entirely\nsceptical of the statements made, and my own experience confirmed\nthis scepticism. For early in this inquiry I made some experiments\nwith a dowser, Mr. Stears, on concealed masses of metal, which were\nunsuccessful ; these are related in the previous Report, p. 176.\nAgain, Colonel Taylor made, at my request, a careful experiment\nat Cheltenham with the dowser, Mr. Tompkins, on concealed coins ;\nthese also were unsuccessful. And yet both these dowsers seem\nto have had singular success in this very direction on other occasions\nwith different experimenters. It is natural to assume such success\nwas due to careless experiment. Perhaps so. On the other hand, we\ndo not require to assume \u2014we know\u2014how very fitful are the psychical\nconditions which ensure success in any experiments connected with\nthe sub-conscious state, such, e.g., as telepathy. Hence it would\nbe an error to attach as much importance to the failure of a\nparticularly psychical test experiment as we should to the failure\nof a corresponding physical experiment the conditions of which\nare known.1\nRecently I have, however, had a certain amount of success in\na more severe test to which I submitted this hypothesis of \"clair\nvoyance.\" In my correspondence and interview with Mr. J. F. Young,\nof Llanelly, who is a member of our Society \u2014and to whom I have\nfrequently referred as a successful amateur dowser\u2014I found that he\nhad occasionally with success tried automatic writing. I therefore\nasked him to try if a pencil held in his hand would write certain\n1 In his admirable address to Section A of the British Association last year,\nProfessor Poynting, F.R.S., pointed out how essentially different are the results to be\nexpected from experiments with living compared with non-living matter. He\nremarks: \"Taking the psychical view, in the living being there is always some\nindividuality, something different from any other living being, and full prediction in\nthe physical sense, and by physical methods, is impossible.\"\n\fxxxvin.] Appendix E. 361\nwords or numbers I would enclose in a sealed envelope : he agreed.\n\"Whereupon I printed some words of three letters, placed them\nbetween a fold of thick paper, and enclosed each in an opaque\nenvelope which was sealed with my own seal as well as otherwise\nsecurely fastened. Three such envelopes I posted to Mr. Young at\nLlanelly, and asked him to try if by automatic writing or by the rod\nhe could ascertain what words of three letters I had written. In\nreply he said :\u2014\nOn receiving your letter I gave the envelopes to my sister-in-law, who took\ncharge of them till I was ready to make the experiment. When at leisure\nin the evening she gave me one of the envelopes marked (3), which I placed\ninside my cap, and put cap and envelope on the top of my bald head. I\nsat at a table, as usual, with a pencil in my hand, and made up my mind as\nblank as possible, patiently waiting till my hand appeared controlled to\nwrite without any volition on my part. After waiting for a little while my\nhand suddenly scribbled out, on an old postcard which was lying near, the\nenclosed, which looks like O N W, or else the last letter is E, ONE. I send\nthe postcard to you with the scribble on it. Will you please say what the\nword is ? I return the envelope.\nI found the experiment very tiring, as if some vital force were ex\nhausted, and will try the other envelopes another time.\nJ. F. Young.\nP.S.\u2014Before posting this letter, I made a second experiment with\nanother of your envelopes, the one marked (2). First I tried with the\nrod in my hands, my sister slowly repeated the alphabet aloud ; this she did\nthree or four times. After the first repetition the rod moved at the letters\nA, B and C and no others. I then tried automatic writing with my eyes\nshut ; the enclosed came, starting from the x \u2014it looks like A. B. On\na second attempt the same letters came somewhat clearer.\nOn receiving the envelopes from Mr. Young I examined them\ncarefully ; they had not been tampered with in any way.

He promised to do so, but unfortunately serious illness\nand death invaded his family, and after his own recovery he has not\nyet felt disposed to go on with the experiments. Prior to his experi\nment with my envelopes, he gave me the result of some experiments\nof a similar kind I had asked him to make in his own way. I have\nentire confidence in Mr. Young's integrity, but the results which I\nwill give must be taken for what they are worth. Mr. Young writes\non January 5th, 1 900 :\u2014\nI made a few trials this evening. I cut some squares of paper all alike,\nput a number of one figure on each, then turned the square upside down,\n1 I should be very glad if any of my readers, who find that a forked twig held\nbetween their hands automatically moves when they pass over certain spots, would\nmake some experiments to ascertain if they possess an incipient clairvoyant\nfaculty. Let them, for example, take two packs of cards, spread out one pack (or\none suit from the pack), on the table, faces up, draw from the other pack (or cor\nresponding suit) a card, face down, and place it, unseen, say beneath the waist\ncoat; this humours the idea (p. 366) that the epigastrium is the most sensitive\nseat of this occult vision. Then walk slowly round the table on which the cards\nare disposed, note if the twig moves over any particular card, and compare the\nresult with the concealed card. Or they might try the eimpler card game which\nMr. A. Lang has described in Longman's Magazine, Vol. XXXI., p. 279: viz., take\nup a card from the top of a shuffled pack and, without looking at it, try if some\nvision of a card floats into the mind ; then compare the result with the actual card\nheld. Mr. Lang finds he is generally successful in this game on the first two or\nthroe trials, but afterwards his guess becomes mixed or hopelessly wrong : this I\nhave also noted in thought-transference experiments. I should be grateful for any\nrecord that may be sent to me (addressed Kingstown, co. Dublin) of such experi\nments, or of any similar ones that may suggest themselves to my readers.\n\fxxxvm.] Appendix E. 363\nshuffled them about in every way, and then picked up one of the squares\nwith my eyes closed, put it on the top of my head and placed my cap on, it\nfitting close to the crown of my head. Then I made myself as passive\nas possible, and either slowly repeated the figures till a certain one seemed\nto be right, or the impression of a particular figure came as soon as I\nput the cap on my head; when it came thus quickly, it was invariably right.\nThis is the result, and the order in which I took up the figures, of course\none at a time, x denotes a wrong guess :\u2014\nFigure on square ... S|4|7|5|S|2|9|3|6|1|\nFigure guessed ... x|4|7|6|x|2|9|x|6|l|\nThe experiment was very exhausting, so that I could not go on any\nlonger.\nIt is curious that the figure 3 should both times be wrong. Mr.\nYoung also tells me he was successful three times out of four with a\nsimilar experiment, only using a rod in his hands and repeating the\nfigures to himself.\nPrevious to making these experiments, Mr. Young had written to\nme as follows :\u2014\nIn the year 1893 I had a remarkable experience when out water-finding\nwith the rod. (It happened to be very dry weather at the time. Whether\nthis had anything to say to it I don't know, but this peculiar experience\nceased when rain set in.) I found that after \" setting \" myself to use the\nrod, i.e., getting into an abstracted mental condition, lost to all around,\nwhen, or just before, the rod turned, I could, \u2014as it were clairvoyantly,\n\u2014see the underground springs and actually appeared able to trace them out\nas I walked along. My friend Mr. Robertson, who, as you are aware, also\nuses the rod with success as an amateur water-tinder, tells me he alao had a\nsimilar experience,1 and we have since read that a \"diviner \" named Adams,\na Somerset man, frequently asserted the same thing.\nAll this may, of course, be a mere illusion, but that it is occasion\nally a veridical illusion seems to he indicated not only from the\nsubsequent test experiments which I have narrated, but also from the\nfact that in the case of others who have had a similar experience,\nwater has been found beneath the spot, though previously searched\nfor in vain in the immediate neighbourhood.\nHere, for example, is such a case. In the English edition of\nReichenbach's researches on his so-called Od force, Dr. Ashburner\ndevotes a lengthy note on pp. 90-106 to the divining rod, and gives a\nremarkable instance of a girl who when mesmerised appeared to be an\nexcellent dowser ; when entranced, if the hazel twig moved in her\nhands, she exclaimed she saw the water a few feet beneath the surface,\nand gave a vivid description of it. Dr. Ashburner quotes in full the\n1 Mr. Robertson is joint author with Mr. Young of a little book on the divining\nrod, in which they narrate their experience and give a good deal of miscellaneous\ninformation.\u2014W.

At the spot where the rod turned and\nthe girl declared she saw the water, a well was dug, and an abundant\nsupply of good water was found a few feet below the surface., though\npreviously the lady states that they had \" very bad water and had\nlong been unable to find a good spring.\"1\nI hope that some tests may be made in England or in the Conti\nnental schools of hypnotism on the possible dowsing faculty of patients\nunder hypnosis.

Parangue\nwas born near Marseilles in 1760, and when quite a child appeared\nable to discern clairvoyantly the presence of underground water, and\nwas successfully employed at several places for this purpose. Figuier\nis naturally somewhat sceptical about this case, for the particulars of\n1 This took place more than 50 years ago, and it seem,d hopeless to obtain any\nconfirmation of this case, as no names were given by Dr. Ashburner; but, curiously\nenough, a letter was sent me from a lady living at Waterford, who, wriiing to a\nfriend apropos of my previous Repor', gave an account of a visit she paid in 1847 to\nher aunt in Hertfordshire, Miss B., and narrates the very circumstance described by\nDr. Ashburner as happening in her aunt's field before her visit. The writer confirms\nseveral of Dr. Ashburner's statements, that the girl dowser was Miss B.'s lady's\nmaid, and also that Miss B. (who narrated the facts to Dr. Ashburner) was an\nexceptionally clever and intelligent lady, not likely to be mistaken, and that there\nhad previously been great difficulty in getting good drinking water, but the spring\nfound by the blindfolded [this is probably a slip of memory] girl was still used in the\nhouse. Reference is made to Miss B.'s deep interest in mesmerism, but not to any\nmesmerising or clairvoyance of the girl. Miss B. probably would not speak of this\nto her young niece. My correspondent was unaware that Dr. Ashburner had\nwritten anything on the subject.\n\u2022 On a future occasion I propose to publish the details of a remarkable case of\nthis kind sent to me sume years ago by a competent observer, the rector of a large\nparish in Cumberland, who was also Chairman of the local Bench of Magistrates.\nThe subject in this case was a lady, a sufferer from chronic illness, who had\ngreatly benefited by hypnotic treatment carried out by my informant under the\ndirection of her medical attendant. In the course of time she developed what\nappeared to be a clairvoyant faculty, and the particular test experiment to which\nshe was submitted, \u2014and which I carefully investigated and verified (so far as it\nwas possible) at the time,\u2014convinced me, as it had already convinced my in\nformant and others, that sooner or later science will haee to admit the existence,\nin certain cases, of a supersensory perceptive power. In this instance any ex\nplanation based on fraud, or hyperesthesia of vision, or chance coincidence, or\nthought-transference was more inconceivable than the admission of some faculty\nnew to science. *\n\fxxxviil] Appendix E. 365\nwhich he quotes the Abbe Sauri, who firmly believed in Parangue,\nand who states that the child was thrown into a paroxysm whenever\nit was brought over a hidden underground spring.1\nWhatever value is to be attached to such narratives as the fore\ngoing, there undoubtedly exists a body of testimony from many able\nand distinguished men, in different countries and in different pro\nfessions, who have become convinced by personal investigation that\ncertain persons can detect the presence of hidden objects in some\ntranscendental manner. I have already referred on p. 247 to the\nopinion expressed by Zschokke. He was a man of great erudition\nand versatility, possessed of a wide knowledge of men and affairs,\nholding a high position as member of the Great Council of State,\nLieut. -Governor of Basle, and historian of Switzerland. He is there\nfore an excellent witness. In his Autobiography, first published in\n1842, he states:\u2014\nIn almost every canton of Switzerland are found persons endowed with\nthe mysterious natural gift of discovering, by a peculiar sensation, the\nexistence of subterranean waters, metals, or fossils. I have known many\nof them, and often put their marvellous talent to the proof. One of them\nwas the Abbot of the Convent of St. Urban, in the canton of Lucerne,\na man of learning and science ; and another a young woman, who excelled\nall I have ever known. I carried her and her companion with me through\nseveral districts entirely unknown to her, but with the geological formation\nof which and with the position of its salt and sweet waters I was quite\nfamiliar, and I never found her deceived. To detail circumstantially every\nexperiment I made to satisfy myself on this point would take up too much\nspace at present, but the results of the most careful observation have\ncompelled me at length to renounce the obstinate suspicion and incredulity\nI at first felt on this subject, and have presented me with a new phase of\nnature, although one still involved in enigmatical obscurity.\nThe evidence on behalf of clairvoyance is really more extensive\nand of greater weight than is commonly known, and those who contest\nthis evidence will find themselves impaled on the horns of a dilemma ;\nthey must either admit thought-transference and stretch that explana\ntion to an absurd length, or they must admit the fact of clairvoyance,\n\u2014meaning by this latter the transcendental perception by certain\nindividuals of an object or writing which cannot be seen by, and is\nunknown to, those present. It is to be noted that cases of clair\nvoyance with persons not in the mesmeric sleep usually occur with\n1 In an article on Modern Maijie by M. Shele de Vere, published in 1873, it is\nstated that \"Catherine Beutler, of Thurgovia, Switzerland, and also Anna Maria\nBriegger, of the same place, were both so seriously affected by the presence of water\nthat they fell into violent nervous excitement when they happened to cross places\nbeneath which large quantities of water were concealed, and became perfectly\nexhausted.\" Long ago, a Portuguese lady, one Pedegacha, is also stated to have been\nsimilarly affected by underground springs.\n\f366 Professor W.

Now it is worthy of note that this\ninquiry has led us to the conclusion that some dowsers also possess, in\ngreater or less degree, a subconscious clairvoyant faculty, and that\nsuch persons exhibit symptoms of induced catalepsy and experience\nsingular sensations in the epigastrium when the object sought for is\ntranscendentally \"perceived\" by them. I have already pointed out\nin Part XII. that the visceral sensations of the dowser are probably\nemotional disturbances, arising from a psychical state, and it is likely\nenough that a similar explanation accounts for the cataleptic subject\nbelieving he sees with his stomach, the sensation being there. But\nthis explanation merely accounts for the secondary effects observed ;\nthe induction of the psychical state still remains a mystery. And\nhere it seems to me that a wholly independent and different investi\ngation should ultimately lead to conclusions so similar to those arrived\nat by other investigators nearly a century ago can hardly be a mere\naccident. A cause common to both, to be found in some perceptive\npower new to science, appears primd facie to be indicated.\n1 See foot-note on p. 309,\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix F. 367\nAPPENDIX F.\nThe Zahoris.\nIn a footnote on p. 5 of my previous paper on the Divining Rod\n{Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXXII.), I quoted a writer in the Quarterly\nReview for 1822, p. 373, who states that \"the faculty of using the\ndivining rod is evidently the same as that possessed by the Spanish\nZahoris, though the latter do not employ a hazel twig.\" The Spectator,\nin an nrticle on the Divining Rod on October Hth, 1882, also refers\nto the Zahoris in the same casual way, as if every one knew all about\nthem. On inquiry I could find no one who could give me any\ninformation beyond a reference to the meaning of the word as given in\nSpanish dictionaries. Thus, in Lopes' Spanish Dictionary the word\n\" Zahori \" is explained as follows :\u2014\" A vulgar impostor pretending to\nsee things, although hidden in the bowels of the earth, if not covered\nwith blue cloth.\" Again, \" Zahoria \" is said to be \"The art of seeing\nas above. The performer must be born on Good Friday.\" Newnan\nand Barretti, in their Spanish dictionary, use identically the same\nwords, and the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy has a\nsimilar description, ending, \"Lynceus homo subterranea videns.\"\nThe word \" Zahori \" is really from the Arabic, meaning \" clear,\"\n\" enlightened \" ; it was, in fact, equivalent to the term a \" clairvoyant,\"\nas that word is now used. The same root occurs in Hebrew, and\nis the origin of the title \" Zohar,\" the famous bible of the Kabbalists.1\nIt seemed, therefore, to be a matter of historical interest to\nascertain what was known concerning these Zahoris. The earliest\naccount I have been able to find of the Zahoris comes to us from\nMexico in the year 1557. It is contained in a folio volume in the\nBritish Museum, entitled Phisica Specufatio, etc., Mexici, 1557?\nwritten by one Alphonsus {Gutierrez) a Vera Cruce. This work was\nreprinted in Salamanca in 1559. In his discourse on the Soul,\u2014\n1 The Zohar is a mystical commentary on the Pentateuch, the title being sug\ngested by the command in Gen. i , 4, \"Let there be light,\" with the exposition\nof which the work begins ; it was compiled between the 3rd and 13th centuries. The\n\" Zoharites \" were an ephemeral Jewish sect of theosophJBts, swearing by the Zohar ;\nfounded about 1750 they had, of course, nothing to do with the Zahoris of two\ncenturies before.\n5 I have to thank Mr. E. Westlake, \u2014who has devoted unwearied patience to the\ncompilation of a complete bibliography of the divining rod,\u2014for the discovery of this\nrare volume in the British Museum. It must have been one of the earliest books\never printed in Mexico. To Miss E. Stokes my best thanks are also due for the\nexcellent translation of this and other passages in the British Museum.\n\f368 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt\nDe Anima, lib. ii., speculatio ii., pp. 300-301 (or pp. 376-377 of the\nSalamanca edition), Alphonsus writes as follows :\u2014\nSpecidatiwi II. of Enchanters, Salntators,1 and of the People vulgady\ncalled Zalwris.\nThere is no one who denies that there may be such an arrangement\nin a man's eyes, that he may be enabled to see at a great distance to\nwhich another man's eyes cannot reach. In the same way there may be\nsuch an arrangement as to enable a man to see an object through some\ndiaphanous medium, whilst other eyes are incapable of discerning the\nshape of the object through the same medium. But I cannot conceive that\nany one's sight can be so constructed that he can see an object behind a\nwall or any opaque substance ; for sight is the effect either of outward\ntransmission, [i.e. from the eyes] as some maintain, or of inward reception,\nas the majority declare. It is not clear how the shape of anything can reach\nthe eye, when it is hidden in the earth, and behind something opaque and\nnot diaphanous ; for how would it pierce through the earth or penetrate\nthe stone? For such shape would necessarily be absorbed on coming in\ncontact with an opaque body, and could not find transit, because it is not a\ndiaphanous body. Wherefore such shape could not reach the eye, neither\ncould the object itself be seen. And I do not see how they [the Zahoris] can\nperceive (as they say) abscesses or humours in the internal organs of a man,\n(their sight not being impeded by the body or clothes) ; nevertheless they\nthemselves assert that they can, and in the same way, on entering a temple\nwhere dead bodies lie, that they can clearly perceive the internal organs of\nthe corpses, if they cast their eyes down. Nevertheless I do not give full\ncredence to their assertions. For these things may be illusions wrought of\nthe devil. Nevertheless I do not condemn them ; for I have known men\notherwise upright, who have declared they see these things. I confess I do\nnot know what cause can produce such natural power ; for it is not the same\nas that alleged by enchanters and salutators ; but is quite different, for\nthe Zahoris say the object is made visible by natural means, by radiating\nits shape to the eye ; if so, it is necessary that the medium through which it\npasses should be diaphanous ; otherwise the shape does not become visible.\nAll philosophers say that air and water are diaphanous mediums, and all\nthings that partake of their nature ; but the earth and opaque bodies are not\nof that kind.\nA few years later a famous Jesuit of Louvain, Martin Delrio,\npublished his great work Disquisitionum Magicarum in three folio\nvolumes. I came across a copy of this work, published in 1599, in the\nfamous library founded by Archbishop Marsh in Dublin.2 In the\nfirst volume, ch. iii., pp. 11 and 12, of this work, Delrio refers to\n1 The word talutator means in low Latin a '- pointer out.\" The index finger was\ncalled digitus ealutatorius, not only from its being used for familiar salutation, but\nalso for pointing out.\u2014W. F. B.\n4 Mr. Elworthy, in his treatise on \"The Evil Eye,\" refers to Delrio's work as\npublished in 1603. This must be a later edition. My own slight literary researches in\nconnection with the history of the Virgula Divina have impressed me with the\nenormous labour and erudition displayed in Mr. Elwortby's classical work.\n\fxxxvm.] Appendix F. 369\nthe Zahoris (he calls them Zahuris), and the following translation\ngives the principal statements he makes : \u2014\nA race of men in Spain are known who are called Zahuris; we may\nname them Lynxes ; when I was staying at Madrid in the year 1575, such a\nboy was to be seen there. They relate that these people see things that are\nhidden in the inward bowels of the earth, veins of water and treasures of\nmetals, and corpses placed within sarcophagi. This thing is most fully received\nand well known. Not only Pindar, Tzetzes, and other poets have thought\nthis possible, but philosophers also (e.g., Coel. Rhodig., lib. 16), some of\nwhom ascribe this power to a melancholy humour.1 ... I think they\nknow veins of water by the vapours exhaled from those places morning and\nevening. They know veins of metal from the grass, of whatever kind, that\nusually grows there. Treasures and corpses I would consider to be indicated\nby demons. . . . They are accustomed to restrict this faculty of seeing\nto certain days, the third and sixth day of the week, which is a token\nof a secret pact. Besides, the redness of the eyes, which is particularly\nto be observed in Zahuris, would rather injure than assist clearness\nof sight.\nIt is interesting to note the prevalent idea of that period, and\nlong afterwards, that demons have the principal hand in the discovery\nof hidden treasure, otherwise Delrio's conjectures indicate shrewd\nobservation on his part. The \"redness of the eyes\" is a curious trait.\nAnother reference to the Zahoris is to be found in a work\npublished in 1643 by Juan Eusebio Nieremberg, entitled Curiosa\ny Oculta Filosophia, 3rd edition; Madrid, 1643. (Reprinted in\nBarcelona, 1645, see pp. 81-82.) Chapter LXXVI. of this work is\ndevoted to the power of the Zahoris, and the following is a trans\nlation of the chief portion (pp. 284-285) :\u2014\nLess is heard of the sight of the modern Zahoris, though it cannot be\ntaken as certain. Celio Rodiginio favours their cause, judging that there\nmay be a natural means of seeing through large, opaque bodies. Another\nattributes what they say they see to the effect of a melancholy humour.\nThis would be a good explanation if facts did not follow their imagination or\nsight ; but springs are found where they point them out, metal where they\nsay they see it, and the dead with all their marks which they perceive, so\nthat it must be attributed to some other cause than melancholy.\nBut knowledge of where water is to be found underground may be\nacquired without much difficulty, without its being necessary for the sight\nto pierce the earth. It was the ancient office of the Aquilegos,\u00b0 whose art\nwas the knowledge of where water was to be found, at what depth, and of\nwhat quality it was. Marcellus wrote of these things among the Romans,\nand is quoted by Cassiodorus. In the time of the king Theodoric a\n1 Melancholy here means madness; as Milton says, \"Moonstruck melancholy,\nmoping madness.\"\u2014W.F.B.\n' Aquilegus (in Latin) was one skilled in seeking out water ; see Facciolati's\nLatin Dictionary.\u2014W. F. B.\n2 I)\n\f370 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nvery celebrated Aquilegus came from Africa, whom Theodoric affectionately\nrecommended to Apronianus that he might give him a suitable salary. The\nmode of discovering the water was by the presence of certain herbs, briars,\nreeds, and other green trees, by certain species of mosquitoes, and light\nvapours which arose from the spot, and by other means which they took,\nsuch as placing dry wool in certain parts at night, well covered, to see if\nit would be found damp. Sweet and salutary waters are qualified by the\nsouth and east wind, and the heavy and less salutary fall with the north and\nwest wind. The same thing may be urged concerning the knowledge of\nmmes of metal, for there may be in the same way natural signs of them, and\ncertain herbs which signify their presence.\nAs to the assertion that the Zahoris can see the buried dead and\ncertain particular marks upon them, Alphonso de Vera-cruz, in the second\nbook of his Anima, and Father Delrio, on the Medea of Seneca and in\nthe first book of his l&ag'ui, attribute this to evil arts ; and I can see no\ngrounds for opposing them, the more so that the power of the Zahoris is\nlimited to certain days, such as Tuesdays and Fridays, which to me is a\nsuspicious circumstance ; also the redness and inflammation of the eyes\nusually found among these people seems to prove that they rather blind\ntheir sight than sharpen it.\nThe most interesting part in this quotation is Nieremberg's refe\nrence to an ancient cult of water-finders, or \" aquilegos,\" as he calls\nthem. In the State papers and letters of Cassiodorus, which form\nour chief knowledge of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths (circa a.d.\n454-526), whose chief minister Cassiodorus was, the reference to the\naquilegus will be found in Epist. LIIL, lib. 3, p. 58. The famous\nJesuit, Father Kircher, in his Mund. Sub. lib. 5, p. 266, also refers\nto the method employed by the aquilex (as he terms it) in water-\nfinding.\nAnother Spanish writer, Feyjoo, in his Theatro Crilico Universal,\nMadrid, 1732, tome III., pp. 101-118, published a paper entitled\nVara Dioinaturia, y Zahories.1 This paper is principally concerned\nwith the discussion of the well known case of Jacques Aymar, whose\nstory was then attracting universal attention. In section VII. the\nZahories are referred to, and the author treats them with scepticism,\nremarking that the multitude is generally credulous, and among all\npeople men of critical faculty and sound judgment are few. He\ncontinues :\u2014\nThe name Zahoris is applied to a class of men of whom it is said that\ntheir vision penetrates opaque bodies, thus causing to appear whatsoever\nmay be hiddon away fathoms deep below the surface of the earth. Perhaps\n1 My friend and colleague, Professor J. P. O'Reilly, Foreign Secretary to the\nRoyal Irish Academy, most kindly translated the whole of this lengthy Spanish\npaper tor me, and I wish here to express my great indebtedness to my learned friend\nfor this and other laborious translations he has cheerfully made for the purpose of my\ninquiry.\n\fxxxvni.] . Appendix F. 371\nwe have inherited thetu from the Moors, since the word Znhori seems\nArabic.1\nIt cannot bo advanced that this virtue is either natural or supernatural ;\nconsequently it must be condemned as either feigned or as superstitious. It\nis not natural, since light does not penetrate into the depth of opaque bodies.\nIn consideration of this we have declared (in the 2nd Vol., Second Discourse)\nas fabulous what is pretended of the penetrating vision of the lynx, and at\npresent we will include under the same rule that son of Aphareus, King of\nthe Messenians, to whom many ancient authors attribute the same excellence\nof sight as that ascribed to the lynx, giving him in consequence the title of\n\" Lynx-eyed \" (Linceo), because, said they, he could see through the trunks\nof trees and rocks, a falsehood which Apollonius, in his poem of the\nArgonauts, immensely exaggerates, pretending that he fathomed with his\nvision the depths of the earth, even to being able to see what was taking\nplace in Hell. Nor do I think that more credit should be accorded to what\nVarro, Valerius Maximus, and other writers tell of that man called Strabo,\nwho iu the first Punic war saw from the promontory of Lilyboeum, in Sicily,\nand counted the vessels which were leaving the port of Carthage, the\ndistance being 130 miles. Even were the atmosphere perfectly diaphanous,\nwhich it is not, there would still be the difficulty that the vessels situated at\na distance of 130 miles would form in the centre of the retina an angle so\nextremely acute that the image would be insensible, as those know who are\nversed in optics.\nAs little can it be alleged that the talent or power of the Zahoris is\nsupernatural. In the first place, it is not credible that it has God as its\nspecial author, since it is a virtue whose only use is to serve greed. It is not\nannounced that the Zahoris disinter treasures to furnish assistance to the\npoor, or to make war on infidels. In the second\" place, because, neither in\nthe sacred writings nor in ecclesiastical history do we read that God 1ms\ngranted this virtue as a permanent habit to any of His many illustrious\nservants. How then can it be believed that, while refusing it to all\nthese His most intimate friends, He has reserved it for men in no way\nremarkable by their merits ? In the third place, supernatural graces are\nnot limited to any particular nation, and of Zahoris, they are said to exist\nonly in Spain.\n1 In the past century (says the Marquis de St. Aubin, tome 3, lib. 4. cap. 2) it\nwas declared that there were in Spain certain men who saw what was under ground\nto a depth of 20 pike handles (picas). Many philosophers failed not to discover (as\nthey thought) reasons for persuading people that this might hapiien quite naturally.\nHe then states that the Mercure franrais of the year 172.S, published an account of a\nPortuguese lady (named Pedegascha). She declared she saw what was in the earth\nto a depth of thirty to forty fathoms, hut as regards the human body, she could not\nsee into it if clothed, the clothing preventing her vision. But the body being un\ncovered, she was able to observe all the interior parts, even the abscesses or any other\ndefect there might he, as well in the humours or soft parts as in the holid. It may be\nthat this fable had its origin not in Portugal, but in France. But this author does\nnot give credence to the existence of the Zahoris, justifying himself mainly for his\nrefusal of assent to my testimony, since having cited my work, he terminate** thus :\n\" The testimony of this Benedictine, being that of a Spaniard, is of great weight to\ngive assurance of the falsity of this opinion.\" [Feyjoo was a Spanish Benedictine.]\n2 D 2\n\f372 Profesxor W. F. Barrett. [part\nAmong the vulgar there is the belief that God dispenses this grace only\nto those who are born on a Good Friday, without considering that there\nshould be an infinity of Zahoris, since many there are who are born on that\nday. Others limit the power to the circumstance of being born at the\nparticular moment at which the Passion is being chanted. Even with this\nrestriction it would follow that there should be in the whole extent of Spain\nfrom 700 to 800 Zahoris, since this total, more or less, results from the\nsupposition that about the same number of men are born every d;iy and\nhour of the year, and that Spain (including Majorca and excluding Portugal)\npossesses seven and a-half millions of persons, which is the population\ndetermined by Sefior Don Geronymo de Urtariz in his excellent work, Theory\nand Practice of Commerce and of Sailing. Consequently, on this computation\nthere would not be a province of Spain which had not four or five dozens of\nZahoris. Where are they, that we may see them ? Nor can it be said that\nthose who pretend to this grace hide it, since God does not concede virtues\nthat they may be of no use.\nThere remains then but to say that this virtue is superstitious, and that\nthose who exercise it have a compact, either expressed or implied, with the\ndevil. In truth, the work of extracting gold from the depths of the earth\nis more of a nature to be attributed to diabolical influence than to the\nDivine assistance, since an abundance of that precious metal rather promotes\nvice than favours virtue. Such, indeed, appears to have been the thought\nof the ancients when they pretended that Pluto, the infernal divinity, was\nthe first discoverer of mines of gold and silver.\nThe author then goes on to say that if the Zahoris really do exist,\nthey are either wizards or rogues, and he prefers to think the latter,\n-as the former would involve a diabolical compact, a far greater crime\nthan being a mere rogue.\nI have quoted this extract at some length, as it gives an interesting\npicture of the habits of thought of a learned Spaniard 1 20 years ago.\nIt is evident the writer had no personal knowledge of the Zahoris, his\ninformation about them appears only to be derived from traditional\nstories coming from a preceding century. During the present century\nI have only come across casual references to the Zahoris, and this race\nof pretended seers, some of whom possibly may have had supernormal\nvision, has long died out, even the very meaning of the word being\nknown to comparatively few.\nIn concluding this note I wish specially to acknowledge my in\ndebtedness to the wide learning and scholarship of my friend the Rev.\nMaxwell Close M.A., for much kind assistance both here and else\nwhere in this research.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix 0. 373\nAPPENDIX G.\nScientific and Literary Opinion.\nBefore closing the present Report it may be instructive to refer to\nsome of the scientific and literary reviews of the previous Report.\nBefore doing so I will quote, by permission, the following interesting\nletters sent to me by two distinguished men of science.\nI will first quote a letter from one of the highest authorities on\ngeology, Sir Archibald Geikie, D.C.L., F.R.S., etc., to whom my hearty\nthanks are due for writing at such length :\u2014\n28, Jermyn Street, London, S.W., Noeember 8th, 1897.\nOn my return last week from a prolonged tour in Eastern Europe I\nfound among the papers and books awaiting me your Monograph on the\nDivining Rod, and I spent most of yesterday in reading it. First let me\nthank you for sending me a copy and next congratulate you on the\npublication of so fair, temperate and interesting a statement of the\nwhole case.\nAs you may believe, my experience has chiefly been among the failures\nof the dowsers, and I have necessarily been led to form a rather low\nestimate of these men and their pretensions. But your narrative leads me\nto recognise that I have never seen the other side, and that I may have done\nthem injustice. It seems to me that a large proportion of their successes\nare such as any intelligent man, giving himself up to the observation of water\nsupply, might easily accomplish without anything more than mother wit to\nguide him. It is most difficult to get accurate information regarding their\nfailures, and the true proportion these bear to their successes. The evidence\nof the men themselves in this matter is not wholly satisfactory, nor is that\nof their employers who have found water.\nIn all such matters I try to keep my mind open. There are so many\nmysteries in nature that one learns every day how foolish is the attitude of\nthose men of science who dogmatically assert that such and such phenomena\nare \"bosh,\" \"rot,\" \"deception,\" \"fraud,\" and all the other choice terms\nthey have so freely at command. I have been accustomed to look at the\ndowsers as either self-deceived or consciously deceiving others. And even\nafter perusing your most interesting volume I am not prepared at once to\nabandon this attitude. But you have brought forward such a body of\nevidence that I must hold my judgment in suspense for a time. If I can be\nsatisfied that there is any instinct, faculty, or whatever you choose to call it,\nwhereby a man can detect the presence of underground running water, I shall\nnever say another word against dowsing, though I shall still think some of\nthe dowsers little better than rogues.\nIf there is such an instinct, why should it not show itself as unfailingly\nin a young and inexperienced hand as in an old and hardened sinner ? You\nattribute some of the failures to the inexperience of the performers. But if\n\f374 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pant\n,*,,\nthe effects are due to some direct reaction of the water below upon the\noperator above, and not to any observation or reasoning on his part, it may\nbe open to question whether the faculty or instinct requires experience for\nits development. Arch Geikie\nTwo criticisms are contained in the foregoing interesting letter :\n(1) Sir Archibald Geikie suggests that a large proportion of the suc\ncesses of the dowser are such as mother wit would account for. The\nevidence adduced in the present Report enables us to judge whether\nthis is so, and the question has been fully discussed. (2) The other\ncriticism is that contained in the last paragraph of the letter. I do\nnot for one moment believe there is any \" direct reaction of the water\nbelow upon the operator above \" ; neither a direct nor an indirect\naction of a physical nature is at all probable. If, however, the dowser\nis able to detect the presence of underground water by any sub\nconscious process, or even supernormal instinct, it is conceivable that\nexperience and practice may consciously or subconsciously be of some\nassistance, and I am disposed to think they are. Sir Archibald\nGeikie refers to his experience of the failures of dowsers. I wish\nparticulars of these had been sent to me, as sometimes they rest\non hearsay. A great failure of Mullins was reported at Carlow and\nreferred to by my geological friends. Here is the result of an\ninvestigation of it on the spot which I asked an able geologist to\nmake :\u2014\nGeological Survey of Ireland, Dublin, July 16tfi, 1900.\nI have made inquiries about Mullins at Clonmel, as promised, and found,\nto my disgust, that the people there made the poor man drunk and turned\nhis performances into a laugh !\nJ. R. KlLROE.\nI will here add the letter of another distinguished naturalist,\nMr. A. R. Wallace, LL.D., F.R.S., who writes as follows :\u2014\nParkstone, Dorset, September 12r\/i, 1897.\nI read your excellent and very thorough paper with the greatest ]A,eosvre,\nand noted a few points of slight disagreement on which 1 determined to\nwrite to you.\nI have long been convinced of the reality of the power of the\n\"dowsers.\" Your resume shows how impossible it is to convince men\nby any amount of evidence till the time is ripe for them to receive it.\nThe large amount of the evidence is even a disadvantage. Few will read\nand iceiyh the mass of evidence you have collected, and I have no\ndoubt many of the sceptics will accuse you of believing anything you\nare told.\nNow for my criticism. At p. 239 you say there are two points adeerse to\nthe dowser\u2014 one being their \"absurd\" idea of the general distribution\nof underground water\u2014either as springs on definite spots or as narrow\n\fxxxvni.] . Appendix G. -\u2022]75\nunderground rivers. But if they really and as a rule believed the former\u2014of\nwhich I can find no evidence in your Report\u2014it would, as it seems to\nme, not be adverse to their possession of some exceptional faculty, but\nin their favour.1 For if they are totally ignorant of the real laws of\nwater-distribution, the chief objection, that they work by acute observation\nand knowledge, falls to the ground. And as to the second \"absurd\"\nsupposition\u2014of water being often in narrow underground streams or\nveins\u2014if your evidence proves anything, it proves that it is often a fact,\nand how can believing in a fact of nature be \"absurd\"? Again, the\nwhole of the dowsers' business would be gone if the geologists' theory\nof saturated strata or surfaces was always or generally true. For then,\nas is the case over considerable areas, any one, could get water by sinkmg\nto the necessary depths to reach the water-bearing stratum. Consequently,\nin such districts dowsers are never required. But where the reverse is\nthe case\u2014and your neighbour may have a good well at 30 ft. while you\nsink 60 ft. in vain\u2014 in such districts alone the dowser is employed ; hence,\nto him, all the available evidence shows underground water to be strictly\nlimited. If he professes to know that this is the unieersal mode of\ndistribution, of course he would be \"absurdly\" ignorant, but 1 am not\naware that he ever says so ; whereas the geologists do say, or imply,\nthat the reverse is so generally the case that the dowser can do nothing\nexcept by guess, etc., etc. ! If either of the two is \"absurd,\" it is not\nthe dowser.\nSome geologists are sublime in their inconsistency. One geologic critic\nsays \"any cottager could have given the same advice\" as the dowser,\n\u2014as if in a district where \"every cottager\" knew where to obtain water,\nany man would be fool enough to get either a dowser or a geologist to\nfind it !\nMr. Wallace then discusses the question of unconscious muscular\naction as the cause of the motion of the rod, but this part of his letter\nI have quoted in Part XL when dealing with that subject. As\nbefore remarked, whatever Mr. Wallace writes is worthy of most\ncareful consideration, for his opinions generally prove to be right\nin the long run, his observation being keener, and his range of know\nledge wider, than most of his critics.\nIn connection with the question of the influence of evidence on\nbelief referred to in the second sentence of Dr. A. R. Wallace's letter,\nit may not be out of place to quote here the opinion of one of the\n1 I stated on the page referred to by Mr. Wallace that according to geological\nopinion \" underground water usually exists in wide saturated areas \" and this opinion\nwas discussed more fully in Appendix B to the previous Report. At the same time\nI ventured to say that the evidence cited in that Report ixiinted to the frequent\noccurrence, underground, of permeable channels as well as permeable areas, and hence\nthat geologists had not sufficiently recognised the truth of the dowser's point of\nview. As a matter of fact, the dowser's most successful achievements are just in\nthose districts where geologists most often fail, viz., in regions where underground\nwater does exist in narrow fissures or channels. This is shown in Mr. Westlake's\nuseful Appendix, p. 3-40.\u2014W. F. B. ^\n\f376 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nearliest and best friends of the S.P.R., Mr. C. C. Massey, who writes\nto me as follows :\u2014\nI am more than ever convinced that it is not so much evidence as a\ndisposition to credit it that is wanted. Is there such a thing as a purely\nobjective standpoint towards evidence ? I doubt it, as also I doubt that any\nevidence whatever can avail to overcome an adverse subjective standpoint.\nI think the true function of evidence is quite misconceived when evidence is\nsupposed to be that which generates belief. p p Massfy\nThere is much truth in what Mr. Massey says ; whether it be due\nto the inertia of our mental processes, which tends to preserve habits\nof thought in the straight line along which they have been started, or\nwhatever be the cause, there is a real difficulty in believing in anything\nunfamiliar to us, and it requires a genuine, and often painful mental\neffort to overcome our tendency to keep on the old lines of thought.\nHence it is that the flimsiest evidence, if it appeals to our preconceived\nideas, is usually accepted without question ; whilst, by the majority of\npeople, the weightiest evidence is rejected, if it requires a dislocation\nof our familiar ideas. This is amusingly illustrated by a story recently\ntold me of an old countrywoman, who firmly believed her sailor son,\nwhen he mentioned Pharaoh's chariot-wheels as lying on the shores of\nthe Red Sea, but was insulted by his silly stories when he told her that\nhe had seen flying fish V\nOn page 221 of my previous paper I refer to the then President of\nthe Geologists' Association of London, Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S.,\nas having recently read a paper on the divining rod before the\nAnthropological Institute. That paper has since been published in\nthe Journal of the Institute, and I have to thank Mr. Holmes not\nonly for the kind reference to my work in his paper, but also for much\nvaluable help which he has from time to time freely given to me, and\nfor his suggestive criticisms from the point of view of a field geologist.\nAnd here let me say that in the practical examination of this\nquestion the co-operation of a geologist is necessary. With the\nexception of Mr. Westlake, F.G.S., whose valuable aid I have\nalready acknowledged, the difficulty has been, just as in other\ndepartments of the work of this Society, to induce those to give\nus their help whose scientific training in a particular direction renders\nthem specially qualified to conduct an investigation such as the present.\nIf, however, I may judge from the letters that have reached me from\nsome eminent geologists, the evidence given in my previous paper\nrenders such co-operation less improbable in the future.\nTurning now to the scientific Press, the leading organ of British\nscience, Nature, had a lengthy review of the Report, a review which\n\fxxxvin.] Appendix G. 377\ncould hardly be described as written in a judicial spirit. l Neverthe\nless I am grateful to the reviewer for his kindly personal references,\nand for drawing my attention to a weak piece of evidence that\nwas inserted in the Report, which I will deal with first.\nOn p. 130 of the Report particulars are given of what appears to\nbe a good case on behalf of the dowser at Wootton, in the Isle of\nWight. The report in the Morning Post was confirmed by the dowser,\nand also by the owner of the estate, a clergyman, who, in reply to my\ninquiries, stated that \" it is quite true that he [the dowser] discovered\nan abundant supply of water where efforts had previously been mado\nin vain.\" The Nature reviewer, speaking from personal knowledge of\nthe place, challenges this, and says that three useless wells were sunk\nby the dowser's advice, and that it did not need a diviner to discover\nwater where it was eventually found. I asked Mr. Westlake, F.G.S.,\nwho has made a special study of hydro-geology, to visit the place and\nreport to me : he kindly did so, and from his report, contained in\nAppendix A, p. 328, there seems little doubt that this case affords no\nevidence for or against the dowser. It appears, however, that the\nNature reviewer is inaccurate in one respect. After visiting the spot\nin November, 1897, and making careful inquiries from residents in the\nneighbourhood, Mr. Westlake writes to me as follows :\u2014\nI found that local opinion did not coincide with that of the reviewer in\nNature. My informants, Messrs. Cole, Turner, Newbury and Barton, said,\nafter reading the review, they knew nothing about the three useless wells\nwhich, according to the reviewer, had been sunk at the diviner's instance in\nthe waterless Oligocene clays. It was true that wells had been sunk in these\nclays near the railway station, and one at Woodside, without success, but\nthey had not been located by diviners. It was the local people' without the\nrod who made these mistakes, and as they were jealous of the diviner, a\nstranger \" from the mainland,\" I think I should have heard of any mistake\nhe made. What the diviner did was to find water where everybody\u2014after\nthe event\u2014knew it was. The reviewer says it \" did not need a diviner to\ndiscover\" it\u2014meaning, should not have needed\u2014with which last I quite\nagree, and regard the Wootton experiments as no evidence one way or\nthe other.\nCuriously enough, not far from the place singled out by the\ngeological reviewer in Nature is a case where the geologist failed to\nfind water and the dowser succeeded. This has been given in detail\nin Part III., p. 164.\nTo return, the \"principal criticism,\" remarks the Nature reviewer,\n\" we have to make on Professor Barrett's collection of facts is, that he\ndoes not give enough weight to the natural tendency of mankind\n1 Nature, October 14th, 1897.\n\f378 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nto conceal their failures.\" I was well aware of the difficulty of\narriving at a just estimate of the number of failures on the part of the\ndowser, but every effort was made to ascertain them, and this point is\nspecially referred to at the outset of the previous Report on p. 4, again\non p. 63, and again on pp. 238 and 239. As I wish to emphasise this\naspect, I will repeat what was then said :\u2014\nIt must be borne in mind that (especially among amateur dowsers) one is\nmore likely to hoar of success than failure, and therefore an extensive and\nsearching inquiry is necessary before any safe induction can be drawn\n(p. 239) . . . All that was possible in the present investigation was to\nmake the range of evidence as wide and unbiassed as possible, and not\nexclude a single case of failure that was substantiated. This has been done\n(p. 238). (The pages refer to the previous Report.)\nIt must not be forgotten that, even with skilled geologists, failures\nare by no means unknown in their predictions of water supply, though\nI am not aware of any treatise on hydro-geology that thinks it\nessential to arrive at and set forth the percentage of failures which\ndifferent geologists have had. Because some people have had a\ncostly experience of the vanity of human opinion, even of expert\ngeological opinion, that is no reason for rejecting the mdispensable\nhelp which expert geologists can give in selecting a suitable site\nfor the boring of an artesian well. It is true they sometimes lead\nto an outlay of \u00a319.600 to no very obvious purpose, but then\nwhat the town loses in water and rates, geology gains in strati-\ngraphical knowledge. To some of these scientific gains, at the\ncost of the ratepayers, I have referred on p. 235 of the previous\nReport. In fact, one of the best English hydro-geologists, Mr.\nDe Ranee, F.G.S., states in a letter to me, which I quoted on\np. 234, that the predictions (as regards water sources) of even\nleading geologists, who are not specialists, \"rest upon chance,\" and\nhe would not be surprised to hear their failures were as numerous\nas the dowsers' ! If both rest upon chance, that certainly would be the\ncase, but if either the dowsers' or the geologists' failures are notably\nfewer than chance would suggest, then the predictions of one or\nthe other do not rest upon chance. Obviously, the question of the\ndowser's success is one thing ; how he arrives at it quite another, and\nthe latter is a matter of insignificance to any one who merely wants\nto sink a well. A scientific inquiry, such as I have attempted, neces\nsarily embraces both these questions.\nFollowing upon this review is a letter from Mr. Wadsworth, of the\nMichigan College of Mines,1 a letter which was largely quoted by the\n\\ i Nature, January 6th, 1898.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix G. 379\nEnglish press as exploding the whole of the dowser's claims.1 I have\nalready referred to and quoted from this letter on a preceding\npage, p. 288, so that I need only say that Mr. Wadsworth's theory is\na little belated, apart from its failing altogether to account for the\ncorrespondence of the movement of the rod with the presence of\nunderground water.\nI will now briefly refer to some of the comments on the Report\nthat have appeared in the ordinary newspaper press. A large collection\nof press notices, reviews and articles based on that report have reached\nniea; but as might be expected, instructive criticism on any of the\nsubjects which occupy the attention of our Society is rarely to be\nfound in the columns of the ordinary daily or weekly newspaper press,\nwith the honourable exception of one or two papers such as the\nSpectator, and from erudite critics such as Mr. A. Lang, to whom\nI am also indebted for the excellent outline of the Report given in\nLongmans Magazine for December, 1897.\nA p.ussing reference must also be made to an able and interesting\nreview of the Report that occupied several columns of that influential\nFrench newspaper, the Journal des De'bats. The review was signed,\nand was from the pen of a naturalist and critic, M. H. de Varigny, to\nwhom my hearty thanks are due for his careful study and summary of\nmy previous paper, and also for some useful information he has\nsubsequently sent to me.\nA well-known Cardiff newspaper devoted a leading article to a\nconcise and fair outline of the Report, which led to a vigorous and\nprotracted correspondence in its columns, between a worthy self-taught\nlocal geologist and our friend the Rev. A. T. Fryer, whose kind\nassistance I have already acknowledged, and to whom my thanks are\ndue for his able and temperate letters in the Western Mail. I am also\nindebted to the editor of the Richmond Times for information he has\nkindly sent me, and for devoting so large a space in his journal to an\noutline of my Report and its discussion.\n1 Mr. Wadsworth's theory was anticipated by his own countryman, Mr. Ralph\nEmerson, in 1826. As mentioned in my previous paper, this is not Ralph Waldo\nEmerson, but an able contemporary of his who entered the ministry a little earlier\nthan his famous namesake ; it was some time before I discovered there were two con\ntemporary Ralph Emersons, probably fellow-students.\n- It is only right that I should here acknowledge the care and skill with which\nDurrant's Press Cutting Agency have supplied me, not only with these press notices,\nbut also with many hundreds of paragraphs and articles on the subject of the divining\nrod and the search for underground water in general. All of these have been read\nand a few have led to useful correspondence, but, as a rule, these newspaper extracts\nare wearisome and worthless.\nS\n\f380 Professor W. F. Barrett. [fart\nSeveral columns of a weekly journal, the New Aye, were also\ndevoted to a friendly discussion of the report and on the S.P.R.\nin general. The article is signed, and the writer, Mr. D. Balsillie,\nlike so many others, assumes that a plausible explanation of any\nobscure phenomenon is probably the correct one, forgetting that\nany experimenter worthy of the name is sure to have exhausted\nall obvious explanations before he ventures upon the publication\nof any experiments which he believes point to some fresh addition to\nour knowledge. Mr. Balsillie takes it for granted, from Hansen and\nLehmann's experiments, that nasal whispering \" explains \" thought-\ntransference, and says, almost in Dr. Scripture's1 words : \u2014\nThus the mystery of thought-transference without contact has been\ncleared up in a way which any one can verify for himself who has access to a\npsychological laboratory.\nThis has been so conclusively answered by Professor Sidgwick and\nProfessor James that I will not dwell upon it; but Mr. Balsillie draws\nfrom it the inference that, as the dowser only detects running, and\nnot stagnant, water, he probably derives his information from some\nsub-conscious perception of sound, and hence he adds :\u2014\nIt might be worth Professor Barrett's while to give some heed to what\nwe have said above about the psychological explanation of thought-\ntransference.\nThe possible exaltation of sense perception on the part of the\ndowser has been dealt with in the previous and the present\nReport.\nIt only remains for me to thank the Editor of Light for the\nfull and excellent summary of the Report that appeared in his\njournal.\nA brief notice of two books on the divining rod, which have been\nrecently published, may here be added. Neither of these books has\nany scientific or literary value. One is an extraordinary medley, written\nby an enthusiastic believer in the rod, and the other is simply a trade\nadvertisement of a professional dowser. I should have passed them\nboth over, but they formed the points d' appui for two interesting\narticles in the Daily News, and one was the subject of a lengthy review\nin Nature, usually considered a scientific journal.2 The first-named\nbook is by Mr. Beaven, and is called Tales of the Divining Rod. It is\nquite impossible to notice this book seriously, as it is a rhapsody in\nturgid English on the glorious \" mysteries of rhabdomancy,\" compiled\nby a tenant farmer and fruit grower of Hereford, who has found the\n1 The New Psychology, p. 260.\n1 Nature, November 2nd, 1890.\n\fxxxviii.] Appendix G. 381\ndowser of considerable use to his fruit farm. Mr. Beaven's experience\nof the rod I gave in the previous Report, on pp. 157 and 158, but in\nhis book, fiction is so intermingled with fact that the author tells us,\nwhen we come to Chapter XXI :\u2014\nAll that I have hitherto written concerning the divining rod has been\nmixed more or less with the imaginative . . . but now, to the end of\nthe book, the truth, and the truth only, shall be stated. That at least is\nmy intention.\nThis laudable intention he strives to carry out by transposing\nto the remaining half of his volume a large part of my previous\npaper ; but, just as in the earlier half he allowed his readers to\nguess which was fact and which fiction, so in the latter half he leaves\nthem, as a rule, to guess which are his own words and which\nare mine.\nMr. Beaven tells us on p. 201 his theory is that, owing to the\nbeneficence of the Creator, every\nimprisoned spring sends up an urgent and unmistakeable message to the\nsurface . . . for man's special benefit. . . . Were those electrical\ninfluences visible, we should probably see every hill and dale dotted over\nwith electric waving mounds, each uprising coil containing a central column\nwhich whirls in an eccentric manner precisely over each fountain head ;\nwhile connected with most of these magnetic mounds are electrical currents\nwaving on the earth's surface over the exact track of every subterranean\nwatercourse. (!)\nThese \" waving electric currents \" are perceived by certain \" gifted\nindividuals\" who have a \" secretive electric power,\" etc. But I need\nnot proceed further, we shall all agree that somebody's brain certainly\n\"whirls in an eccentric manner,\" and Mr. Beaven's book will at any\nrate afford entertainment to any scientific man who happens to\nread it.\nThe other book, as I have said, is an advertisement issued by the\ndowser, Mr. B. Tompkins, who writes after his name \" W.F.\"\n(meaning water-finder). Mr. Tompkins' Theory of Water-finding (as\nhis book is called), is even more amusing than the descriptive letters\nhe has conferred upon himself ; his theory is, of course, \" Electricity.\"\nHe and Mr. Beaven resemble the rustic who, describing to me a\nghostly light he had seen at a certain spot, said (in answer to my\ninquiries as to what the light resembled), that \" it was just like an\nelectric light.\" When I asked him where he had seen the electric\nlight, he replied \" I never seen it, maister, but it were just like it.\"\nSo Mr. Tompkins tells us all about electricity, what it really is,\nhow it moves the rod, and how he has thus been able to \" unfold the\n\f382 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\n-.\nbewildering enigma of the divining rod\" . . . and how he trusts\nere long to receive the reward due to his efforts.\nOf a very different character is an excellent little manual on the\ndiscovery of underground water by E. S. Auscher, entitled L Art\nde de'couvrir les Sources (Paris, Balhere, 1899). This book is not\nmeant for hydro-geologists, but to meet the needs of those who require\na general knowledge of the method of finding underground water. It\nalso includes a wide range of subject matter subsidiary to its main\nobject, such as the analysis of water, the best methods of boring, etc.\nA section is devoted to the btu\/uetle divinatoire (divining rod), but\nhere the author, like so many other writers on this subject, falls into\nnumerous errors, not only in the history of the baguette, but in its\nmode of use, etc. He states (p. 144) that\nthe skill of the operator consists in moving the index fingers (les index) so\nslightly that the rod appears to turn automatically, as if it obeyed a super\nnatural impulse.\nAnd yet, a few pages further on, the author states that the dis\ntinguished members of the commission appointed by the Paris\nAcademy of Sciences to inquire into the baguette,1 arrived at the\nconclusion that the motion of the rod was due to unconscious muscular\naction on the part of the operator. Moreover, M. Auscher appears to\nbe unaware that one of the most eminent anthropologists in France,\nProfessor Gabriel de Mortillet, was once a successful dowser with the\nbaguette, and has written a little book on the subject, entitled Hisloire\nde I'hydroscopic et de la baguette divinatoire, which was published in\n1850. M. Auscher often refers to the work of L'Abbe\" Paramelle as\na water finder, and speaks of him with a certain respect. So little\nis known of Paramelle in England that I have given an outline of his\nlife-work and book in Appendix D (see p. 352), and have devoted some\nspace to a discussion of his methods, in so far as they relate to the\ngeneral subject of this paper.\nAs these sheets are passing through the press a statement has\nappeared in several English and foreign newspapers that a new French\nCommission had been appointed to inquire into the evidence on behalf\nof the baguette divinaloire (divining rod), and that a hydraulic engineer\nwas appointed president of the Commission, giving his name and\naddress. After several futile attempts to get further particulars,\nI received at last two badly printed circulars\u2014one advertising the\n1 Referred to in my previous Report, p. 14. The facts are briefly these : in 1853\nthe French Academy nominated a Committee of three eminent men, MM. Chevrenl,\nBoussingault, and Babinet, to report on a paper on the BtujueUe Dirinatoire which\nhad been presented by a M. Riondet. Chevreul was requested by his colleagues to\ndraw up the report, which led to the. publication of his work on the Divining Rod\nin 1854.\n\fxxxvin] Appendix G. 383\nbusiness of the engineer in question and soliciting the favour of\na commission, and the other stating that the Socie'te' Magne'tique de\nFrance (whatever that may be) had appointed a committee of five\npersons, chiefly members of that Society, to report on the \"apparatus\"\nemployed by sounders to seek for underground water. In answer to\ninquiries from an English amateur dowser, the business president\nof this so-called commission states that he is deputed \"to make a\nprecise inquiry into the mathematical laws (!) of the bm\/uetle,\" and he\nadds his opinion that money ought to be made out of the sourciers'\nbusiness. From which the scope and scientific value of this commission\nmay be inferred ; very different from the 1853 Committee referred to\nin the foot-note on the previous page.\ns\n\f384 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nSUPPLEMENT.\nI.\nPSEUDO-POSSESSION.1\nBy F. W. H. Myers.\nI have selected for joint discussion two books which, while differing\nwidely in scope and purpose, do nevertheless agree in furnishing\nstriking examples of a kind of study which is at present of prime\nimportance to the psychologist.\nBoth works contain careful analyses of certain cases of modified\nor multiplex personality;\u2014ranging from the hysterical ide'es fixes with\nwhich Dr. Janet deals, to the complex case of apparently sane and\nhealthy, yet enormously active, subliminal mentation which forms the\nsubject of Professor Flournoy's book.\nNow I hold that all accessible modifications of personality should be\nstudied in detail and in connection ;\u2014so that all may ultimately fall into\ntheir place in that long series which extends from the confines of\ninsanity on the one hand up to possession and ecstasy on the other.\nWe ought through such study to attain a much wider conception\nthan of old of the possibilities which lie hid in man. For the psycho\nlogist must surely feel more and more the insufficiency of the physician's\nconception of ordinary health and sanity as a summit from which all\nother states constitute a decline. It will not do any longer to regard\nhuman nature only with the aim of maintaining it as it already is.\nThat is the doctor's view, and it was the necessary view for science to\nbegin with ; but the time has come for disinterested curiosity as well as\nfor mere therapeutic care. There exists a greater range, we may fairly\nsuppose, in the scale of cosmic existence above human nature than there\nexists below it; and, while taking care not to narrow or injure our exist\ning powers, it should also now be our object to learn, if possible, how\nto extend them. Janet's book is important on the one side; Flournoy's\ntakes us one short step onwards on the other. Both books are not\nonly learned and painstaking but even brilliant. Few students of\n1 N&proses et Idees fixet. Vol. I. By Professor Pierre Janet. Vol. I [. By Pro\nfessor F. Raymond and Professor Pierre Janet.

Vermilye,\nunder the title of From India to the planet Mars, published by Harper and Brothers,\nNew York and London, 1900.1\n\fPart XXXVIII.] Pseiulo-Posaession. 385\nmorbid psychology have ever shown an acumen equal to Dr. Janet's ;\u2014\nfew writers on matter of difficult controversy have ever produced so\ndelightful an impression of absolute, instinctive candour as Professor\nFlournoy. The literary execution is in each case first-rate, and the\nmastery of these works is one of the most agreeable as well as essential\ntasks of the experimental psychologist.\nTo begin with Professor Janet. It must be remembered, of course,\nthat the aim of his work is medical, and great though its philosophical\ninterest is, a certain allowance must be made throughout for the\nenvironment of the Salpetriere. In that atmosphere human beings are\napt to get divided somewhat too simply into medecins and malades,\u2014\nmon excellent maitre and la pauvre dlse'quilibree. In hospital lectures it\nis not easy to remember that there is a great world outside the hospital\nwhere faculties are more mixed and ideals perhaps more expansive.\nOnce outside the hospital\u2014to make at once what small reserves I\nhave to make as to Dr. Janet's competence\u2014this acute physician walks\nwith a less certain step. The paper on crystal-gazing, for instance, in\nVol. I. of the present work, while ingeniously illustrating such part of\nthe subject as hospital practice can teach, does yet merely evade the\nharder problems involved ;\u2014evades them so adroitly that beyond this\none sentence it calls for no comment here.1\nSince there are over a thousand large closely-printed octavo pages\nto deal with in Professor Janet's book, some slight preliminary sketch\nof its main topics will be of use to the reader.\nThe first volume deals with experimental studies on the troubles of\nthe will, the attention, and the memory ;\u2014troubles which are in most\ncases associated with ide'es fixes or hypertrophies of some one \" systema-\ntised group \" of memories or emotions.\nThus the volume contains in Chap. I. the striking case of\n\" Marcelle,\"\u2014a patient in whom \"aboulia,\" or defect of will, is the most\nmarked of many symptoms. Chap. III. is devoted to cases of loss of\nmemory ; Chap. IV., V, IX., to other extensive confusions and\ndisabilities, induced by the persistence of ide'es fixes below the conscious\nthreshold. Chap. X. is a history of actual pseudo-possession, showing\nthe mischief wrought by a fixed idea self-suggested in continued reverie.\nOther chapters on allochiria, hemianopsia, contractures, paralysis, etc.,\nshow these subconscious self-suggestions operating in curiously limited\nand definite ways.\n1 Since I' shall (have nothing else but admiration and adhesion for Dr. Janet's\nwork, I think it right here to call attention\u2014his own attention most of all\u2014to Mr.\nAndrew Lang's criticisms in The Making of Religion, p. 367, seq. These strictures,\ncoming from an eminent writer who is assuredly not chargeable with any parti pria\nin favour of the marvellous ;\u2014assuredly not lacking either in urbanity or in acumen ;\u2014\ndeserve, I think, to be pondered by Dr. Janet, with no mere thought of controversial\nrejoinder.\n2 E\n\f386 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nThe second volume contains observations on no less than 152 cases.\nWhether the disorders are classed as \"psychical\" or as \"somatic,\"\nthey all illustrate the same general thesis ;\u2014namely, the great variety of\nways in which the hypertrophy of some idea, impression, impulse, or\nmemory, can invade and disintegrate that human personality, which\nneeds the maintenance of an equilibrium between so many complex\nand competitive agencies within.\nIt is satisfactory to find that hypnotic suggestion,\u2014used by Dr.\nJanet with great patience and tact,\u2014is able gradually to remove a\ngreat number of these mental spasms and insistent memories.,. It is\nnot, of course, enough to make the suggestion crudely and bluntly. In\norder to enable it to take, it must be grafted adroitly upon the patient's\nmental condition of the moment. First of all, one must discover the\nhidden sources of her trouble,\u2014of which sources, strangely enough, she\nis often herself unaware ;\u2014and then one must gradually suggest\nsuccessive slight modifications in the painful memory. \" The incident\nwhich gave you the shock was not so bad as you think ;\u2014it really\nhappened thus and thus,\" says Dr. Janet, \u2014until at last the old horror is\nforgotten,\u2014or transformed into something grotesque or innocuous.\nThus one patient is led to believe that the haunting word \" cholera \"\nis really the name of a Chinese general ;\u2014another, who has loved not\nwisely, but too well, is induced to see the lover of her hallucinatory\nmemories with head transformed into a pig's ;\u2014and undergoes a\nrevulsion of feeling, a la Titania. (Vol. II., p. 135.)\nAnother curious case (Vol. II., p. 256) in which hypnotism first\nexplained the trouble and then did much to amend it, is that of a boy\n\" Rou,\" whose short life has been plentifully interspersed with hysterical\n\" fugues \" or escapades, of which (like Ansel Bourne, Proceedings,\nVol. VII., p. 221) he loses all memory when he returns to normal life.\nHe comes to himself suddenly,\u2014in a forest,\u2014in a convent,\u2014in a street-\npassage,\u2014and, as I say, remembers nothing ;\u2014except an occasional\ndrenching from rain or river,\u2014which has, in fact, for the moment,\npartially awakened him from his somnambulic state. Hypnotisation,\nhowever, brings back the memory of the \" fugues \" (just as it did with\nAnsel Bourne), and we find that they have all been the working out\nof an ide'e fixe,\u2014that of going to sea as a cabin-boy. During these\nfugues the lad was anresthetic, and consequently endured cheerfully\nextraordinary hardships, allowing himself with perfect insouciance to\nbe treated by rough canal-men like a beast of burden. Hypnotic\nsuggestion was able to avert these fiu\/ues whenever the boy was dimly\nconscious that they were coming on ;\u2014although his brain was too pro\nfoundly affected to make the prognosis a hopeful one.\nMany of these cases remind us of the narratives of Drs. Breuer\nand Freud, in their Studien iiber Hysterie, noticed in S.P.R. Proceedingx,\n\fPart xxxviii] Pseudo-Possession. 387\nVol. IX., pp. 12-15. I give as a sample one case of this type,\n(Janet, Vol. II., p. 234), where hysterical attacks depending on the\nrevival of a scheme of emotion (e'tat e'motif sysh!matique) which has\nbecome subconscious are cured by this same process of first di\u00bb:mvr'mg,\nand then gradually removing, the alarming memory.\nA girl of 18, designated as Lie, has suffered for two years from\nalmost daily convulsive attacks. Each attack constitutes a revival of\na past scene, constituting in rudimentary form a secondary state of\npersonality. The attack begins with syncope, and the return to\nconscious life is a return to a condition of terror, with cries of \" Lucien,\nLucien\" ;\u2014as if appealing to some one for defence ;\u2014then she rushes to\nthe window and cries \" Thieves ! \" and then gradually re-enters her\nordinary state. Asked what she can remember of such a scene, the\ngirl can recollect nothing. She thinks that her attacks were originally\ninduced by distress and fear at the sight of her father's drunkenness.\nShe knows no one called Lucien. She came to Paris alone, and there\nseems to be no external way of supplying any possible defect in her\nmemory.\nHypnotism, however, comes promptly to the physician's aid.\nThrown into the hypnotic sleep, the patient recovers at once the details\nof a tragic story of her childhood ;\u2014of an insult offered to her, from\nwhich a \" Lucien \" had defended her ;\u2014and of a theft at the chateau\nwhere she worked, which followed a few days later. These terrifying\nevents gave rise to attacks of syncope, somnambulism, etc. ;\u2014and those\nattacks had now, in their turn, obliterated the memory of the events\nfrom the patient's waking mind. When she was reminded of them,\nthey gradually recurred to her ;\u2014and at the same moment the convul\nsive attacks which had been troubling her more or less ever since the\nevents occurred, entirely ceased.\nHere is another remarkable case (p. 248) of the efficacy of hypnotic\nsuggestion, first in discovering the nature of a mental confusion, and\nthen in curing it. A young officer, Pk., is brought to the Salpetriere,\nhaving fallen down in the Champs Elysees, and seeming entirely\nbewildered on rising up again. Arrived at the hospital, he holds out\nhis hand to Dr. Janet and addresses him as Dr. N.\u2014a doctor at a\nmilitarv hospital at Brest. Asked what he means, and where he\nsupposes himself to be, he replies, \" We are at the military hospital at\nBrest, and you are Dr. N. They brought me here a few days ago\u2014in\nMay, 1896.\" As a matter of fact, this occurred on July 6th, 1895.\nNext day, the patient is in a different phase, and knows quite well that\nhe is in Paris,\u2014although he remembers nothing about imagining himself\nto be at Brest. On inquiry it appears that this young man of twenty-\neight is suffering from the combined effects of typhoid, dysentery,\nmarsh-fever, sunstroke, an unfortunate marriage, and a tendency to\n\f388 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nabsinthe. These troubles have made him hysterical, so that if he\nreceives any shock or stimulus\u2014as a threat of divorce or a glass of\nbrandy\u2014he is apt to become unconscious, and then to act in all sorts of\nodd ways, till he wakes up again in surprise and with no recollection.\nFortunately he can be thrown at once into a somnambulic state\nwhich brings back the memory of the spontaneous somnambulisms.\nHe is then able to explain how he came to suppose himself to be in the\nhospital at Brest and in the year 1890. He had, in fact, while walking\nin the Champs Elysees, been planning to apply for treatment in a\nmilitary hospital, and calculating that by about May, 1896, he would\nbe in the hospital at Brest, where he knew the aforesaid Dr. X.\nFalling into his secondary state, he had no longer the ability to\ndistinguish between this reverie and reality ;\u2014and the continuing\nreverie substituted itself for the actual surroundings, so that he\nimagined himself to be already in the Brest hospital,\u2014as if his\ncalculation had already worked itself out.\nSo soon as his excessive modifiability had thus been discovered, it\nwas comparatively easy to give him the suggestions needed to set right\nhis habits and to inspire him with strength for the future. He has\nsince distinguished himself in military service abroad.\nThe stories of these distressed patients are not always thus tragic.\nThe characteristic \" anguish of doubt,\" for instance,\u2014the recherche\natu\/oissante which makes many lives miserable,\u2014may centre itself on\nsome subject not intrinsically painful. Thus a patient of Legrand du\nSaulle's (as Dr. Janet reminds us) suffered from a perpetual anxiety to\nfeel sure whether any woman whom he happened to have met was\npretty or plain. An attendant was paid to answer, \" Plain, sir ! I\nshould say, decidedly plain ! \" to each inquiry ;\u2014and the too sensitive\nheart was kept at rest. But on one occasion his master asked this man\nduring a railway journey as to the looks of the young woman at the\nticket-window of the station whence they had started ;\u2014and the man\nwas stupid enough to say that he had not observed her. This led to a\nterrible crisis, and the valet had to travel back the whole way in order\nto bring his report, \" Plain, sir ! decidedly plain ! \"\nAnother distressing but somewhat grotesque case was that of a\nkleptomaniac who stole from everybody, but especially from himself.\nWorse than the somnambulic hero of an old Ingoldsby Legend, who\nburied a fresh pair of his own trousers every night in the garden,\nthis boy could keep nothing by night or day from his own marauding\nhands. He stole from himself when he was asleep, but he stole from\nother people when they at any rate were wide awake, and saw perfectly\nwhat he was doing. In fact, the psychological interest of this case\nlies in the poor fellow's own condition at the moment of his thefts,\u2014\nwhich was a kind of semi-hypnotisation by involuntary self-suggestion,\n\fBurt xxxvin.] Pseudo-Possession. 389\nclosely resembling the half-hypnotised state into which an awakened\nsubject falls when the time comes for him to execute some post-hypnotic\nsuggestion. This unwilling kleptomaniac seemed to be subject to a\npermanent self-suggestion to carry off any object which he particularly\nnoticed ; and his own gaze at a silver spoon would throw him into a\ndreamy condition in which he inevitably put that spoon in his pocket.\nAnother melancholy aberration, which is not without its comic\nelement, is described by Janet under the heading of \" Dipsomania of\noaf4 an lait, complicated with kleptomania of petits pains.\"\nMme Pt., a nervous personage, suffered from a dyspepsia which\nher doctor mistakenly attributed to dilatation of the stomach. He\nlimited her to a wineglass of liquid at each meal, and made her live\nmainly on dry toast. Her husband supported the doctor, but meantime\nshe saw him drinking cafe\" au lait and eating rolls with gusto and\nfreedom ;\u2014\" c'e'tail pour elle le supplice de Tantale.\" One day her\npatience gave way. When her husband's back was turned, she threw\nherself upon a roll which he had left on his plate, then rushed to the\ncremerie, and made herself an excellent cafe\" au lait. She was none the\nworse for it ; her husband it was who died. After his death the\npassion for cafe\" au lait grew on her, so that when her stock of milk was\nexhausted at night she would tread her room in anguished longing till\nthe crSmeries opened in the morning. Not venturing to drink more\nthan two cups at the same cremerie, she would wander about Paris and\ndrink at various shops 20 or 30 cups per day.\nAll these cups she duly and promptly paid for. But a morbid\naggravation came. She wanted rolls with her coffee ; but now that there\nwas no one to forbid her the rolls, they lost their savour,\u2014the savour\nof petit pain dejendu. A way of supplying this savour occurred to\nher ;\u2014she stole the rolls. She would go to a shop and pay for one roll,\u2014-\nand adroitly make several others fall into a Gampish umbrella. Having\ncollected a dozen or so, she would go home to eat them, and start\nagain.\nNow, this poor woman\u2014this coffee-megalomaniac, as an erudite\nfriend of Professor Janet's has termed her\u2014becomes not infrequently\nvery uncomfortable inside. She detests her own obsession, her ideejixe ;\n\u2014but she cannot cure herself ; nor had Professor Janet, at the time of\nwriting,, succeeded in curing her. .\nA grotesque, yet a mournful story! a tragedy of the \"free breakfast\ntable ' ! nay, a satire on all the inordinate cravings of men, whose\ninsatiability is the penalty for their self-abandonment, and which\ndisgust by the very fulfilment of desire. Dr. Janet's book contains\nexamples of \"fixed subconscious ideas\" at various depths of submer\ngence ;\u2014the most completely forgotten being often the most potent for\nmischief. A fixed memory of this kind,\u2014removed, so to say, from the\n\f390 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\ngeneral mental circulation,\u2014may act in precisely the same way as an\nactual lesion to motor nerves, inducing definite physical disabilities.\n\"The contraction persists,\" says Dr. Janet of one such case (Vol. I.\np. 344) \" because the emotion persists, involving always the same\npsychological and physiological consequences. It is, so to say, a,ji.wd\nemotion ;\u2014a variety of fixed idea of which we from outside can see only\none exterior manifestation, while the patient herself is unaware of the\ninterior phenomenon which determines it.\"\nTo attempt to cure such patients without first discovering the\ntrue cause of mischief by some automatic message (such as writing\nor crystal vision or utterance in hypnotic trance) which emanates\nfrom subliminal strata of their being, is like trying to open a secret\ndrawer without having discovered the spring. The minute and patient\nattention which Dr. Janet bestows on such cases contrasts strikingly\nwith the rough and ready methods thought good enough for hysterical\npatients by doctors of the old school. It means, of course, one more\napplication of true scientific method to problems which the Philistine\nphysician did not think worth his science. There can be no better\nexample of this than Dr. Janet's treatment of a singular problem which\nthe mistakes of brutal ignorance turned in old times into a veritable\nscourge of our race. I speak of demoniacal possession ;\u2014in which\naffliction Dr. Janet has shown himself a better than ecclesiastical\nexorcist.\nI give here a typical case of pseudo-possession. Achille,\u2014as\nProfessor Janet calls him,\u2014was a timid and rather morbid young man ;\nbut he was married to a good wife, and nothing went specially wrong\nwith him until his return from a business journey in 1890. He then\nbecame sombre and taciturn,\u2014sometimes even seemed unable to speak,\n\u2014then took to his bed and lay murmuring incomprehensible words, and\nat last said farewell to his wife and children, and stretched himself out\nmotionless for a couple of days, while his family waited for his last\nbreath.\n(Vol. I., p. 382.)\u2014\"Suddenly one morning, after two days of apparent\ndeath, Achille sat up in bed with his eyes wide open, and burst into a\nterrible laugh. It was a convulsive laugh which shook all his limbs,\u2014\nan exaggerated laugh which twisted his mouth ;\u2014a lugubrious, satanic\nlaugh which went on for more than two hours.\n\" From this moment everything was changed\u2014-Achille leapt from\nhis bed and refused all attentions. To every question he answered,\n'There's nothing to be done ! let's have some champagne ! it's the end\nof the world ! ' Then he uttered piercing cries ' they are burning me ;\n\u2014they are cutting me to pieces ! ' \"\nAfter an agitated sleep, Achille woke up with the conviction that\nhe was possessed with a devil. And in fact his mouth now uttered\n\fpart xxxviii] Pseudo-Possession. 391\nblasphemies, his limbs were contorted, and he repeatedly made un\nsuccessful efforts at suicide. Ultimately he was taken to the Salpetriere\nand placed under Professor Janet, who recognised at once the classic\nsigns of possession. The poor man kept protesting against the odious\noutrages on religion which he attributed to a devil inside him, moving\nhis tongue against his will. \" Achille could say, like a celebrate!\nvictim of possession, Pere Surin, ' It is as though I had two souls ; one\nof which has been dispossessed of its body and the use of its organs,\nand is frantic at the sight of the other soul which has crept in.' \"\nIt was by no means easy to get either at Achille or at his possessing\ndevil. Attempts to hypnotise him failed, and any remonstrance was\nmet with insult. But the wily psychologist was accustomed to such\ndifficulties, and had resort to a plan too insidious for a common devil to\nsuspect. He gently moved the hand of Achille in such a way as to sug\ngest the act of writing, and having thus succeeded in starting automatic\nscript he got the devil thus to answer questions quietly put while the\nraving was going on as usual. \" I will not believe in your power,\"\nsaid Professor Janet to the malignant intruder, \" unless you give me a\nproof.\" \" What proof ? \" \" Raise the poor man's left arm without his\nknowing it.\" This was done,\u2014to the astonishment of poor Achille ;\u2014\nand a series of suggestions followed, all of which the demon trium\nphantly and unsuspectingly carried out, to show his power. Then came\nthe suggestion to which Professor Janet had been leading up. It was\nlike getting the djinn into the bottle. \" You cannot put Achille\nsoundly to sleep in that armchair ! \" \" Yes, I can ! \" No sooner said\nthan done,\u2014and no sooner done than Achille was delivered from his\ntormentor,\u2014from his own tormenting self.\nFor there in that hypnotic sleep he was gently led on to tell all his\nstory ;\u2014and such stories, when told to a skilled and kindly auditor, are\napt to come to an end in the very act of being told.\nAchille had been living in a day-dream ; it was a day-dream which\nhad swollen to these nightmare proportions, and had, as it were, ousted\nhis rational being ;\u2014and in the deeper self-knowledge which the\nsomnambulic state brings with it the dream and the interpretation\nthereof became present to his bewildered mind.\nThe fact was that on that fateful journey when Achille's troubles\nbegan he had committed an act of unfaithfulness to Ids wife. A\ngloomy anxiety to conceal this action prompted him to an increasing\ntaciturnity, and morbid fancies as to his health grew on him until at\nlast his day-dream led him to imagine himself as actually dead. \" His\ntwo days' lethargy was but an episode, a chapter in the long dream.\"\nWhat then was the natural next stage of the dream's development ?\n\"He dreamt that, now that he was dead indeed, the devil rose from the\nabyss and came to take him. The poor man, as in his somnambulic state\n\f292 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nhe retraced the series of his dreams, remembered the precise instant\nwhen this lamentable event took place. It was about 1 1 a.m. ;\u2014a dog\nbarked in the court at the moment, incommoded, no doubt, by the smell\nof brimstone ;\u2014flames filled the room ;\u2014numbers of little fiends scourged\nthe unhappy man, or drove nails into his eyes,\u2014and through the wounds\nin his body Satan entered in to take possession of head and heart.\"\nFrom this point the pseudo-possession may be said to have begun.\nThe fixed idea developed itself into sensory and motor automatisms ;\u2014\nvisions of devils, uncontrollable utterances, automatic script\u2014ascribed\nby the automatist to the possessing devil within.\nAnd now came the moment when the veracity, the utility, of this\nnew type of psychological analysis was to be submitted to yet another\ntest. From the point of view of the ordinary physician Achille's\ncondition was almost hopeless. Physical treatment had failed, and\ndeath from exhaustion and misery seemed near at hand. Nor could\nany appeal have been effective which did not go to the hidden root\nof the evil ;\u2014which did not lighten the load of morbid remorse\nfrom which the whole series of troubles had developed. Fortunately\nfor Achille, he was in the hands of an unsurpassed minister to minds\nthus diseased. Professor Janet adopted his usual tactics ;\u2014what\nhe terms the dissociation and the gradual substitution of ideas. The\nincidents of the miserable memory were modified, were explained away,\nwere slowly dissolved from the brooding brain ;\u2014and the hallucinatory\nimage of the offended wife was presented to the sufferer at what\nnovelists call the psychological moment,\u2014with pardon in her eyes.\n\" Such stuff as dreams are made of ! \"\u2014but even by such means was\nAchille restored to physical and moral health ; he leads now the life of\nnormal man ; he no longer \"walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth\nhimself in vain.\"\nThe title of \" pseudo-possession \" which I have given to this review\nis partly justified by the case just described. Yet, as we shall presently\nsee, this is not the form of pseudo-possession which is most difficult to\nunderstand and classify.\nIn Achille's case we have nothing but disease and delusion ; we\nshall presently find it harder to explain phenomena one stage higher,\nwhere the submerged mental action is complex and in no way hurtful ;\n\u2014yet cannot be interpreted as evidencing an external control.\nI will conclude my notice of Dr. Janet's book by touching on a\ncognate problem of which again only the early stages have come under\nhis observation ;\u2014but where the relation of each stage to the stage above\nit is as yet inextricably obscure. I speak of ecstasy;\u2014of all that range\nof sensations which present themselves as a temporary \"standing-forth\"\nfrom the body, with more or less conscious or definite communion\nwith or entry into a spiritual world.\n\fv\u00bbrt xxxviii.] Pseudo-Possession. 393\nThis phenomenon, alleged in many centuries and many nations, has\nusually been explained in one of two ways ;\u2014neither of which seems to\nme satisfactory.\na. In the first place, it has been connected by theological writers\nwith the dogmas of the special religion in which they believed ;\u2014and\nwhich their ecstatic visions are assumed to corroborate. As an example\nof such treatment I may allude to the recently published Bampton\nLectures by Dr. Inge on Christian Mysticism, which have justly\nattracted admiration from their tone, alike scholarly and devout. Un\nfortunately, however, these qualities are not sufficient for the task of\nshowing that there is any real connection between the ecstasies into\nwhich Pagans and Buddhists just as much as Roman Catholics or\nProtestants have fallen and the dogmas or traditions of any one of the\ngreat sections of the Christian Church. The impression which a reader\nfamiliar with the operation of self-suggestion is likely to carry away\n. from Dr. Inge's book is rather of wonder that there is not a stronger\ncase for such connection ;\u2014that self-suggestion has not given a more\ndecided flavour of Christian dogma to the very vague,\u2014though often\ndeeply genuine,\u2014accounts of ecstatic experiences which Dr. Inge has\nbeen able to collect. I will not pursue a line of argument which it\nwould be invidious to press, and which will hardly meet with any\nscientific opposition.\nRather I will turn to the other habitual type of explanation, \u2014that\nwhich explains away all ecstasy as a mere subjective symptom\u2014a\nhysterical experience which medical science should treat as it treats an\nidee fixe or a recurrent contracture.\nHere, I think, is just one of the points where the psychologist\nshould be on his guard against the physician. The psychologist, as I\nhave so often said, must remember that there are phenomena above\nordinary human nature as well as below it, and that if anywhere we\ncan trace an ascending series of vital phenomena, it is very unlikely\nthat we are ourselves standing at that series' superior limit.\nThere is undoubtedly a lower limit to what I may term the ecstatic\nseries ;\u2014a rudimentary or hysterical ecstasy which seems to be nothing\nmore than a mere blankness and vacancy. First above that perhaps\nwe may place two cases which Dr. Janet briefly mentions ;\u2014adding (I\nam glad to see) a hint that he may return to the subject later.\nThe first of these cases is that of a girl, \" Celestine,\" who is a\ndefinitely hysterical subject. (Vol. I., p. 302-3). After an attack of\nhysterical anger she remains absolutely motionless on her bed, arms\nand legs stretched out, fists closed, and teeth clenched.\n\"This condition, which may be prolonged for two or three days\nif not interfered with, is psychologically very remarkable. The\npatient, entirely insensible to all external stimuli, retains a certain\n\f39-t F. W. H. Myers. [Supplemeni.\nconsciousness ; she has complex dreams, which she has forgotten on\nwaking, but of which she recovers memory in hypnotic trance. These\nvaried dreams are specially characterised by a feeling of well-being,\nof beatitude ; the patient feels no link with earth, is unconscious of\nher body, and seems to float in air. I have noticed the same feeling of\nbeatitude in another patient, who loses the possibility of motion and\nthe consciousness of her body. One wonders whether there is any\nrelation between the two phenomena.\"\nThe next case of ecstasy (Vol. I., p. 95) carries us one step higher,\nand occurs in a woman who is intelligent and not anaesthetic, but who\npresents certain symptoms classed by Drs. Raymond and Janet as\nhysterical\u2014especially stigmatisation\u2014or the mark as of a wound\nimitating Christ's Passion, which used to rank as a sign of sanctity.\nThis xtupnatise'es wound is on the foot,\u2014in imitation of the mark of\nthe nail. Her ecstasies are of the accustomed saintly type ;\u2014and the\nfollowing accidental test of her condition during ecstasy forms an\nincident probably unique in the long history of stigmatises from\nS. Francis to Louise Lateau.\nDr. Janet was collecting series of reaction-times from various\nsubjects ;\u2014testing, that is to say, the quickness and regularity with\nwhich they could make a motor response (as pressing a button, etc.)\nto some irregularly recurring stimulus, of touch, sound or sight. Of\ncourse the quicker and more regular the response, the more highly does\nthe experimenter rank the attention and capacity of the subject.\n\"This subject,\" says Dr. Janet, \"was very docile, and tried to fix her\nattention on the sound of the signal and on nothing else. But after\nabout a quarter of an hour, I perceived that an unforeseen incident\nseemed likely to disturb the experiment. Vk. began an attack of\necstasy. Her eyes half closed, her head sank backward, and her face\nassumed an expression of beatitude. . . . Little by little her body\nrose on tiptoe, the left arm took a horizontal position, and she placed\nherself in the attitude of crucifixion which is common in her ecstasies.\nI was struck by observing that her right arm did not raise itself as\nmuch as usual, for the top of the forefinger continued to touch the\nbutton used in the experiment (iuterritptenr). Thus, in spite of the\ncomplete ecstasy, the tracing continues to be produced. I prolonged\nthis singular experience of taking reaction-times during a religious\necstasy for two hours and a-half. Hhe then awoke, but with a remark\nable fidelity to her promise, she continued to reply to the signals during\nand after her process of awakening, so that I was able to get a graphic\nreaction-curve taken before, during, and after the ecstasy.\"\nOmitting details, I may say that the graphic response was quickest\nand most regular during the height of the ecstasy;\u2014in spite of attempts\nmade by Dr. Janet to disturb the subject by sudden noises, pinching,\n\fPart xxxviii.] Pseudo-Possession. 395\netc.,\u2014attempts which had no effect at all in distracting her from her\nduty, although she must have felt them, since she retains her power of\nsensation in the trance.\nThe general lesson which Dr. Janet draws from this and other\nexperiments is that the more automatically you can get the reaction\nperformed the better it is performed ;\u2014in short that subliminal attention\nis more trustworthy than supraliminal. On the present case he adds the\nfollowing reflections :\u2014\n\" Is it likely that Vk., during the crisis of ecstasy, when she raises\nto heaven a face of beatitude\u2014when she takes the position of cruci\nfixion,\u2014is bestowing on my signals a closer attention than at the\nmoment when she is quietly sitting in an armchair with nothing to\ndo but to listen ?\n\" Moreover, she does partially remember her ecstasies, and she tells\nus of the unspeakable joys which she has been experiencing. While\nshe was responding to my signals she felt herself flooded by religious\nemotion. ' I felt an ineffable sweetness on my lips ; presently they\nclosed ; a torpor stole over my limbs, but the torpor was full of sweet\nness.' Then in complete ecstasy : ' I saw the Holy Sacrament in a\nlight, a radiance, a glory inexpressible, and I was filled with unspeak\nable gladness. A voice within me made me understand that by the\nact of communion I carried Jesus within me as though I were a living\nmonstrance.'\n\" But I will not here discuss (continues Dr. Janet) the ecstasies of\nthis patient ; the phenomenon is too striking to be treated thus inci\ndentally. I merely remark that during this ecstasy she made a long\nmeditation, not without philosophical and poetical value, on the union\nof the soul with God. I observe also that she remembered this reflec\ntion, and remembered also the noises which I made in the room, and my\npinches on her arm. When I asked her as to the special point of her\nattention to my signals and her own answering movements, she\nanswered, ' I believe that I kept my hand on the machine, as you told\nme, but God must have guided my hand to obey your orders, for I was\nnot myself able to pay them any attention.' \"\nI must now reluctantly leave Dr. Janet's book ;\u2014observing only\nthat in the midst of this record of multiform disintegrations and con\ntortions of personality we have here come, nevertheless, upon certain\nsigns of increased faculty,\u2014of subliminal steadiness of muscular\naction under difficulties,\u2014of ecstatic happiness, and even of intel\nlectual exaltation.\nThe book to which I now turn has for readers of our Proceedings\nan even directer interest. It happens, no doubt, to any group which\npursues for many years a somewhat unfamiliar line of inquiry that\n\f396 F. W. H. -Myers. [Supplement.\nthose of their points which are first assailed get gradually admitted,\nso that as they become interested in new points they may scarcely\nobserve what change has taken place in the reception of the old. The\nreader of early volumes of our Proceedings will often observe this kind\nof progress of opinion. And now Professor Flournoy's book indicates\nin a remarkable way how things have moved in the psychology of the\nlast twenty years. The book,\u2014a model of fairness throughout,\u2014is\nindeed, for the most part, critically destructive in its treatment of the\nquasi-supernormal phenomena with which it deals. But what a mass\nof conceptions a competent psychologist now takes for granted in this\nrealm, which the official science of twenty years ago would scarcely\nstomach our hinting at !\nOne important point may be noticed at once as decisively corrobor\nating a contention of my own made long ago, and at a time when it\nprobably seemed fantastic to many readers. Arguing for the potential\ncontinuity of subliminal mentation (as against those who urged that\nthere were only occasional flashes of submerged thought, like scattered\ndreams) I said that it would sewn be found needful to press this notion\nof a continuous subliminal self to the utmost, if we were not prepared\nto admit a continuous spiritual guidance or possession. Now, in fact,\nwith Professor Flournoy's subject the whole discussion turns on this\nvery point. There is unquestionably a continuous and complex series\nof thoughts and feelings going on beneath the threshold of con\nsciousness of M\"e \"HeUene Smith.\" Is this submerged mentation due\nin any degree or in any manner to the operation of spirits other than\nM\"e Smith's own 1 That is the broad question ; but it is complicated\nhere by a subsidiary question ;\u2014whether, namely, any previous incar\nnations of Ml!e Smith's,\u2014other phases of her own spiritual history,\nnow involving complex relationship with the past,\u2014have any part in\nthe crowd of personalities which seem struggling to express themselves\nthrough her quite healthy organism.\nMlle Smith, I should at once say, is not, and never has been, a\npaid medium. She occupies a leading post on the staff of a large\nmaixon de commerc? at Geneva, and gives seances to her friends, simply\nbecause she enjoys the exercise of her mediumistic faculties, and is\nherself interested in their explanation.\nHer organism, I repeat, is regarded, both by herself and by others,\nas a quite healthy one. Mlle Smith, says Professor Flournoy, declares\ndistinctly that she is perfectly sound in body and mind, in no way\nlacking in equilibrium, and indignantly repudiates the idea that\nthere is any hurtful anomaly or the slightest danger in mediumship\nas she practises it.\n\" I am so far from being abnormal,\" she writes, \" that I have never\nbeen so clear-sighted, so lucid, so capable of judging rapidly on all points,\n\fPart xxxviii] Pseudo-Possession. 397\nas since I have been developed as a medium.\" No one appears to\ndispute this estimate, which the facts of Mlle Smith's progress in her\nline of business distinctly confirm.\n\" It is in fact incontestable \" (continues Professor Flournoy) \" that\nHelene has a head extremely well organised ; and that from a business\npoint of view she manages admirably the very important and com\nplicated department of which she is at the head in this large shop\nwhere she is employed ;\u2014so that to accuse her of being morbid simply\nbecause she is a medium is to say the least an inadmissible petitio\nprincipii so long as the very nature of mediumship remains a thing so\nobscure and open to discussion as is still the case. . . .\n\" It is clear that there exist amid the ranks of the learned faculty\ncertain spirits narrow and limited, strong in their own specialities, but\nready to cast their anathemas at whatever does not fit in with their\npreconceived ideas, and to treat as morbid, pathological, insane, every\nthing which differs from the normal type of human nature, such as they\nhave conceived it on the model of their own small personalities. . . .\n\" But in the first place the essential criterion in judging of a human\nbeing's value is not the question whether he is in good or bad health,\nlike or unlike other people, but whether he fulfils adequately his special\ntask,\u2014how he acquits himself of the functions incumbent on him, and\nwhat may be expected or hoped from him. I am not aware that Miss\nSmith's psychical faculties have ever interfered with her accom\nplishment of any of her duties ;\u2014rather they have helped her therein ;\nfor her normal and conscious activity has often found an Unexpected\nassistance,\u2014which non-mediums lack !\u2014in her subliminal inspirations\nand her automatisms, which effect a useful end.\n\" In the second place, it is far from being demonstrated that medium-\nship is a pathological phenomenon. It is abnormal, no doubt, in the\nsense of being rare, exceptional ;\u2014but rarity is not morbidity. The\nfew years during which these phenomena have been seriously and\nscientifically studied have not been enough to allow us to pronounce\non their true nature. It is interesting to note that in the countries\nwhere these studies have been pushed the furthest, in England and\nAmerica, the dominant view among the savants who have gone deepest\ninto the matter is not at all unfavourable to mediumship ; and that, far\nfrom regarding it as a special case of hysteria, they see in it a faculty\nsuperior, advantageous, healthy, of which hysteria is a form of\ndegenerescence, a pathological parody, a morbid caricature.\"\nThe phenomena which this sensitive (Helene Smith is Professor\nFlournoy's pseudonym for her) presents cover a range which looks at\nfirst very wide, although a clearer analysis shows that these varieties\nare more apparent than real and that self-suggestion will perhaps\naccount for all of them.\n\f398 F. W. H. MyeT8. [Supplement.\nThere is, to begin with, every kind of automatic irruption of\nsubliminal into supraliminal life. As Professor Kournoy says (p. 45) :\u2014\u2022\n\"Phenomena of hypermnesia, divinations, myst r ious findings of lost\nobjects, happy inspirations, exact presentiments, just intuitions, teleo-\nlogical (purposive or helpful) automatisms, in short, of every kind:\u2014\nshe possesses in a high degree this small change of genius ;\u2014which\nconstitutes a more than sufficient compensation for the inconvenience\nresulting from those distractions and moments of absence of mind\nwhich accompany her visions ;\u2014and which, moreover, generally pass\nunobserved.\"\nAnd here I reach an appropriate point at which to remark that\nthis book of Professor Flournoy's is not the first account which has\nbeen published of Mlle Helene. Professor Lemaitre, of Geneva, printed\ntwo papers about her in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques ;\u2014first, a\nlong article in the number for March-April, 1897,\u2014then a reply to\nM. Lefebure in the number for May-June, 1897. In these papers he\ndistinctly claims supernormal powers for M1Ie Helene,\u2014implying a\nbelief in her genuine possession by spirits, and even in her previous\nincarnations, and in the reality of the extra-terrene or ostensibly\nMartian language. I read these papers at the time, but put them\naside as inconclusive, mainly because that very language, on which\nM. Lemaitre seemed most to rely, seemed to me so obviously factitious\nas to throw doubt on all the evidence presented by an observer who\ncould believe that denizens of another planet talked to each other\nin a language corresponding in every particular with simple French\nidioms, and including such words as quisa for quel, quise' for quelle,\nve'teche for voir, veche for vu ;\u2014the fantastic locutions of the nursery.\nM. Lemaitre remarks, as a proof of the consistency and reality of the\nextra-terrene tongue, \" L'un des premiers mots que nous ayons eus,\nme'tiche,, signifiant monsieur, se retrouve plus tard avec le sens de\n\/uimme.\" That is to say, having transmogrified monsisur into me'tiche,\nHelene further transmutes les messieurs into ce'e me'tiche ;\u2014in naive\nimitation of ordinary French usage. And this tongue is supposed to\nhave sprung up independently of all the influences which have shaped\nterrene grammar in general or the French idiom in particular ' And\neven after Professor Flournoy's analysis of this absurdity I see\nnewspapers speaking of this Martian language as an impressive\nphenomenon !\nVery possibly the same critics might object, say, to the utterances\nof the Thaw children through Mrs. Piper (S.P.R. Proceedings, Part\nXXXIV.) as too trivial and childish for a spiritual world. Yet surely\nit should hardly be needful to say that on the principle of continuity a\nchild passing from earth into that world will still be occupied with\nchildish things ;\u2014while, on the other hand, the evolution of another\n\fPart xxxvm.] Pseudo-Possession. 399\nplanet, if it has culminated in conscious life at all, can hardly have\nculminated in a conscious life into which we could all of us enter\naffably, with a suitable Ollendorff's phrase-book under our arms ;\u2014\n\" eni cf'e me'tiche one (jude\",\"\u2014\"ici lea hommes (messieurs) sont bons,\"\u2014\u2022\n\" here the men are good \" ;\u2014and the rest of it.\nYet I am bound in fairness to say that, judging M. Lemaitre too\nsweepingly from this linguistic standpoint, I assumed that one remark\nable incident which he quotes could probably be explained away ;\u2014\nwhereas Professor Flournoy has not really explained it away at all.\nThis is the case of Jean le Carrieur. Stated briefly, it is admitted that\nHelene, after experiencing a hallucinatory smell of sulphur (charac\nteristic of a quarryman's work), had a vision of a man working, never\nknown to her, who sent a message to a Mme Mirbel, not present at the\nseance. This man, and the scene in which he appeared, were clearly\nrecognised by Mrae Mirbel as belonging to her childish memories ;\u2014\nwhile it is most improbable that the little incidents in question should\never have reached HeMene's ears. Mme Mirbel had, however, been\npresent at some of Helene's seances, and Professor Flournoy thinks\nthat on one of these occasions the subliminal self of Helene had drawn\nthese memories telepathically from Mme Mirbol's mind. This kind of\npossibility, of course, has always to be faced. Its relative probability,\nas compared with spirit-influence, has to be inferred in each case from\na wide group of experiences. But whatever the solution which we\nadopt for this incident of the quarryman, it must, I think, go some\nway towards proving Mlle Helene's supernormal gifts.\nAt seances, \u2014where the deeper change has no inconveniences,\u2014\nHelene undergoes a sort of self-hypnotisation which produces various\nlethargic and somnambulistic states. And when she is alone and safe\nfrom interruption she has spontaneous visions, during which there may\nhe some approach to ecstasy. At the s&inces she experiences positive\nhallucinations, and also negative hallucinations, or systematised\nanwsthesiae, so that, for instance, she will cease to see some person\npresent, especially one who is to be the recipient of messages in the\ncourse of the seance. \" It seems as though a dream-like incoherence\npresided over this preliminary work of disaggregation, in which the\nnormal perceptions are arbitrarily split up or absorbed by the sub\nconscious personality,\u2014eager for materials with which to compose the\nhallucinations 'which it is preparing.\" Then, when the s&mee begins,\nthe main actor is Hellene's guide Leopold (a pseudonym for Cagliostro)\nwho speaks and writes through her, and is, in fact, either her leading\nspirit-control or (much more probably) her most developed form of\nsecondary personality.\nHelfene, indeed, has sometimes the impression of becoming Leopold\nfor a moment (p. 117). Professor Flournoy compares this sensation with\n\f400 F. W. H. Myers. (Supplement.\nthe experience of Mr. Hill Tout (S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. XL,\np. 309), who feels himself becoming his own father, who is manifesting\nthrough him. It should be added that, although somewhat pompous,\nLeopold always appears both sensible and dignified. \"Leopold,\" saya\nProfessor Flournoy (p. 134) \"certainly manifests a very honourable\nand amiable side of Mlle Smith's character, and in taking him as her\n' guide ' she has followed inspirations which are doubtless among the\nhighest in her nature.\"\nThe high moral quality of these automatic communications, on which\nProfessor Flournoy thus insists, is a phenomenon worth consideration.\nI do not mean that it is specially strange in the case of Mlle Smith.\nShe appears to be (if the phrase is thought permissible in describing\na medium) a person of remarkably well-regulated mind. One is not\nsurprised that her subliminal self should be as blameless as her supra\nliminal. But in reality the remark here made by Professor Flournoy\nhas a much wider application. The almost universally high moral\ntone of genuinely automatic utterances,\u2014whether claimed as spirit\ncommunications or proceeding obviously from the automatist himself,\u2014,\nhas not, I think, been sufficiently noticed, or adequately explained. I\nwill mention two points which have struck me as specially noticeable.\nIn the first place I have read many pulpit and other attacks on\n\" spiritualism,\" under which name all automatic utterance is commonly\nincluded, and I cannot remember any instance in which such an\nattack has been made effective by the quotation of passages of immoral\ntendency\u2014base, cruel, or impure. The attack, so far as I know, has\nalways been of a kind which, in the eye of the philosopher, is rather\ncomplimentary to the writings attacked. For it seems (and this is the\nsecond point to which I wished to call attention here) that no one of\nthe various conflicting Churches has been able to claim the general\ndrift of automatic messages as making for its special tenets. The\nvarious controversialists, where they have been candid, have admitted\nmoral elevation, but,\u2014from their various opposing points of view,\u2014\nhave agreed in deploring theological laxity.\nI must indeed confess myself unable to explain why it is that\nbeneath the frequent incoherence, frequent commonplaceness, frequent\npomposity of these messages there should almost always be a substratum\nof better sense, of truer catholicity, than is usually to be heard except\nfrom the leading minds of the generation. It is possible that in some\nhidden way the Zeit-Geist affects the subliminal strata even of persons\nsuperficially narrow and bigoted by an influence urging them all in\nsomewhat the same direction ;\u2014so that the best available thought of the\nage is inspiring the age more profoundly than we know. And it is\npossible also that these utterances may bear in reality some obscure\nrelation to truths profounder than we have as yet normally acquired.\n\fPart xxxviii.] Pseudo Possession. 401\nWhat is omitted, indeed, from current beliefs is as significant as what\nis added thereto, and the general product looks more like a very poor\naccount of something which in itself is great and new, but dimly\napprehended, than like a compromise between conflicting dogmas, or a\nselection from familiar hortatory themes.\nThus much I think it was fair to say ;\u2014or I may speak more strongly\nand maintain that thus much it was a positive duty to insist upon. It\nis only right that this mass of communications, taken as a whole, should\nbe defended from the random accusations of journalist or pulpiteer.\nYet, in view of what is here to follow, I must lose no time in defining\nthe limited extent to which my support of automatic messages goes.\nI think, then, that in evidential messages,\u2014where there is real reason\nto believe that an identified spirit is communicating,\u2014there is a marked\nand independent consensus on such matters as these spirits profess\nthemselves able to discuss. And, again, in non-evidential messages,\u2014\nin communications which probably proceed from the automatist's\nsubliminal self,\u2014I hold that there is a remarkable and undesigned con\ncordance in high moral tone, and also in avoidance of certain prevalent\ntenets, which many of the automatists do supraliminally hold as true.\nBut I also insist that these subliminal messages, even when not inco\nherent, are generally dream-like, and often involve tenets which\n(though never in my experience base or immoral) are unsupported by\nevidence, and are probably to be referred to mere self-suggestion.\nProminent among such tenets is one which forms a large part of\nM,le Smith's communications ; namely, the doctrine of reincarnation,\nor of successive lives spent by each soul upon this planet.\nThe simple fact that such was probably the opinion both of Plato and\nof Virgil shows that there is nothing here which is alien to the best\nreason or to the highest instincts of men. Nor, indeed, is it easy to\nrealise any theory of the direct creation of spirits at such different\nstages of advancement as those which enter upon the earth in the guise\nof mortal man. There must, one feels, be some kind of continuity,\u2014\nsome form of spiritual Past. Yet for reincarnation there is at present\nno valid evidence ; and it must be my duty to show how its assertion\nin any given instance,\u2014M\"e Smith's included,\u2014constitutes in itself a\nstrong argument in favour of self-suggestion rather than extraneous\ninspiration as the source of the messages in which it appears.\nWhenever civilised men have received what they have regarded as\na revelation (which has generally been somewhat fragmentary in its\nfirst delivery) they have naturally endeavoured to complete and\nsystematise it as well as they could. In so doing they have mostly\naimed at three objects; (1) to understand as much as possible of the\nsecrets of the universe ; (2) to justify as far as possible Heaven's deal\nings with men ; and (3) to appropriate as far as possible the favour or\n2 F\n\f402 F. W. H. Myers. (Supplement.\nbenefit which the revelation may show as possibly accruing to believers.\nFor all these purposes the doctrine of reincarnation has proved useful\nin many countries and times. But in no case could it seem more appro\npriate than in this last revelation (so to term it) through automatic\nmessages and the like. And as a matter of history, a certain vigorous\npreacher of the new faith, known under the name of Allan Kardec,\ntook up reincarnationist tenets, enforced them (as there is reason to\nbelieve) by strong suggestion upon the minds of various automatic\nwriters, and set them forth in dogmatic works which have had much\ninfluence, especially among Latin nations, from their clarity, symmetry,\nand intrinsic reasonableness. Yet the data thus collected were\nabsolutely insufficient, and the Livre des Esprits must simply rank\nas the premature formulation of a new religion,\u2014the premature\nsystematisation of a nascent science.\nI follow Professor Flournoy in believing that the teaching of that\nwork must have directly or indirectly influenced the mind of M\"e\nSmith,\u2014and is therefore responsible for her claim to these incarnations\nprevious to that which she now undergoes or enjoys.\nOn the general scheme here followed, each incarnation, if the last\nhas been used aright, ought to represent some advance in the scale of\nbeing. If one earth-life has been misused, the next earth-life ought to\nafford opportunity for expiation,\u2014or for further practice in the special\nvirtue which has been imperfectly acquired. Thus Mlle Smith's present\nlife in a humble position may be thought to atone for her overmuch\npride in her last incarnation,\u2014as Marie Antoinette.\nBut the mention of Marie Antoinette suggests the risk which this\ntheory fosters,\u2014of assuming that one is the issue of a distinguished\nline of spiritual progenitors ;\u2014insomuch that, with whatever temporary\nsets-back, one is sure in the end to find oneself in a leading position.\nPythagoras, indeed, was content with the secondary hero\nEuphorbus as his bygone self. But in our days Dr. Anna Kingsford\nand Mr. Edward Maitland must needs have been the Virgin Mary and\nS. John the Divine. And Victor Hugo, who was naturally well to\nthe front in these self-multiplications, took possession of most of the\nleading personages of antiquity whom he could manage to string\ntogether in chronological sequence. It is obvious that any number of\nre-born souls can play at this game ;\u2014but where no one adduces any\nevidence it seems hardly worth while to go on. Even Pythagoras\ndoes not appear to have adduced any evidence beyond his ipse\ndixit for his assertion that the alleged shield of Euphorbus had in\nreality been borne by that mythical hero. Meantime the question as\nto reincarnation has actually been put to a very few spirits who have\ngiven some real evidence of their identity. So far as I know, no\none of these has claimed to know anything personally of such an\n\fPart xxxviii.] Pseiulo-Possession. 403\nincident ;\u2014although all have united in saying that their knowledge\nwas too limited to allow them to generalise on the matter.\nHelene's previous incarnations,\u2014to return to our subject,\u2014do\nperhaps suffer from the general fault of aiming too high. She has to\nher credit a pre-incarnation in the planet Mars ;\u2014another as an Indian\nPrincess ; and a third (as I have said) as Marie Antoinette.\nIn each case there arc certain impressive features in the impersona\ntion ; but in each case also careful analysis negatives the idea that we\ncan be dealing with a personality really revived from a former epoch,\nor from a distant planet ;\u2014and leaves us inclined to explain everything\nby \"cryptomnesia\" (as Professor Flournoy calls submerged memory), and\nthat subliminal inventiveness of which we already know so much.\nThe Martian pre-incarnation was naturally the most striking at\nfirst sight. Its reality was supported by a Martian language, written\nin a Martian alphabet, spoken with fluency, and sufficiently interpreted\ninto French to show that such part of it, at any rate, as could be com\nmitted to writing was actually a grammatical and coherent form of\nspeech.\nThis to the ordinary reader sounds like good evidence. To the\nstudent of automatisms, on the other hand, as I have already said, it\nirresistibly suggests the automatist's own subliminal handiwork. It\nis a case of \"glossolaly,\" or \"speaking with tongues\" ; and we have no\nmodern case\u2014no case later than the half-mythical Miracles of the\nCevennes\u2014where such utterance has proved to be other than gibberish.\nI have had various automatic hieroglyphics shown to me, with the\nsuggestion that they may be cursive Japanese, or perhaps an old dialect\nof Northern China ;\u2014but I confess that I have grown tired of showing\nthese fragments to the irresponsive expert, who suggests that they may\nalso be vague reminiscences of the scrolls in an Oriental tea-tray.\nIt seems indeed to be a most difficult thing to get telepathically\ninto any brain even fragments of a language which it has not learnt.\nA few simple Italian, and even Hawaian, words occur in Mrs. Piper's\nutterances, coming apparently from departed spirits, but these, with\nsome Dutch words recently given through another sensitive, form, I\nthink, the only instances which I know. And, speaking generally,\nwhatever is elaborate, finished, pretentious, is likely to be of subliminal\nfacture ; while only things scrappy, perplexed and tentative have\nfloated to us veritably from afar.\nAnalysis of the so-called Martian language proves it to be no excep\ntion to this rule. It is, in fact, a childish, though elaborate, imitation\nof French ;\u2014whose true parallel lies in those languages of the nursery\nwhich little brothers and sisters sometimes invent\u2014as a tongue not\nunderstanded of their elders. The outbursts of this Martian speech\nare noticeable as a parallel to the \"deific verbiage,\" which used to\n\f404 F. W. H. Myera. [Supplement.\nthrong through the lips of Mr. le Baron (Proceedings, Vol. XII., p. 277),\nand for a long time impressed itself upon him as having some reality\nin it somewhere.\nThe most interesting peculiarity, indeed, in the Martian tongue is\nits exclusively French formation ;\u2014which would seem to argue its elabo\nration in a mind familiar with French alone. Now Mlle Smith, \u2014who,\nby the w'ay, is no linguist,\u2014had some German lessons in her girlhood,\nand one is thus led to the curious supposition that the Martian tongue\nwas invented by some element in her personality which preceded the\nGerman lessons.\nI fancy that I have mentioned somewhere, but I may perhaps recall\nhere, a trivial experience of my own illustrative of this ingenious\nhypothesis of Professor Flournoy's. I once dreamt that I saw an\nepitaph in Greek hexameters inscribed on a wall,\u2014of which on waking\nI remembered only one line\u2014\u2022\nAvrap 6 p(V Kara yqv dakcphv KVtre baKViiptvov nvp.\nI could not construe this line, which is, in fact, nonsense :\u2014till I\nremembered in a sudden flash a certain sense of shame felt by me as a\nsmall boy at having thought that Koto meant under, \u2014as though (ierra yr)v\nwere yrjs Kuto>-\nThe line, then, had a meaning : \" But he, indeed, beneath the\nearth, embraced the strong consuming flame ;\"\u2014not a well-chosen\nsentiment for an epitaph, perhaps, but yet up to the ordinary level of\none's dreaming self. There must, then, have been some fragment of me\nyet surviving from innocent boyhood, and blundering subliminally in\nthe same old style.\nThis fact of the different age of M\"e Smith's life to which\nher hypnoidal elucubrations in this aspect belong seems to me to\nconstitute one of the most interesting psychological points in her\nmediumship. It tends to show that her secondary personalities are\nprobably in their origin\u2014as has sometimes l)een suggested\u2014phenomena\npartly of reversion in the ordinary personality,\u2014survivals or momentary\nreturns of inferior phases, overpassed for a longer or shorter time, and\nwhich should normally have been absorbed in the development of the\nindividual instead of appearing externally in strange proliferations.\nJust as teratology illustrates embryology, which in return explains\nteratology, and as both of these unite in throwing light on anatomv,\nsimilarly one may hope that the study of the facts of mediumship may\nsome day help to furnish us with some just and fruitful view of normal\npsvchogenesis,\u2014which in return will enable us better to comprehend\nthe appearance of these singular phenomena ;\u2014so that psychology in\ngeneral may thence acquire a better and exacter conception of human\npersonality.\n\fPart xxxviii.) Pseudo-Possession. 405\nThe faculty here touched upon\u2014the strong reviviscence of long-past\nemotional states\u2014seems to me eminently characteristic, at any rate, of\nartistic and poetical genius.\nThe artist must needs desire to have his whole life to draw upon.\nHe must often wish to live in the past more vividly than in the present,\nand to feel again what he has felt, even more than to see again what he\nhas seen. Visual and auditory memories, pushed to absolute vividness,\nbecome hallucinations of vision or audition ; and this point of absolute\nhallucination few artists are able or even desire to reach. But\nemotional or affective memory may for some gifted natures be pushed\non to all its old actual vividness with pure gain to art ;\u2014nay, if the man\nhimself has grown more capable of feeling, then the revived emotion\n(like certain optical memory-images) may even go beyond the original.\nThus Sully Prudhomme says, in speaking of a hidden insurgent\nmemory of this type : \" C'est meme cette reviviscence qui seule me\npermettrait de retoucher les vers que cette petite aventure, si ancienne,\nm'a fait commettre, et de faire beneficierde l'experience que j'ai acquise\ndans mon art l'expression de mes sentiments d'autrefois.\" And he asks\nwhether every memory of feeling does not assume a certain character of\nhallucination. Wordsworth (as Aubrey de Vere has told us, and as the\nsonnet \"Surprised by joy,\" shows) had very much the same experience.\nAnd Littre (Revue Positive, 1877, p. 660) describes what he calls the\n\" affective automnesia,\"\u2014or spontaneously arising flow of emotion with\nwhich quite suddenly, and late in life, he remembered losing a young\nsister when he was ten years old : \" Ce meme evenement s'est reproduite\navec une peine non moindre, certes, que celle que j'\u00e9prouvais au moment\nmeme, et qui aila jusqu'a mouiller mes yeux de larmes.\"1\nThis train of reflections, I think, well illustrates that kinship\nbetween the working of what is admitted as genius and the dreamlike\nsubliminal mentation with which we are here dealing, of which I have\noften spoken, and to which I must again presently recur.\nTurning now to the Hindoo pre-incarnation, we observe that it\noffers a linguistic problem of a rather different kind. Certain Sanscrit\nletters are written, and certain Sanscrit words are uttered ;\u2014mixed, it\nis true, with much quasi-Sanscrit gibberish, and not exceeding what a\nquick eve and memory might pick up in a few hours from a Sanscrit\ngrammar. Helene, however,\u2014whose complete good faith is vouched\nfor on all sides, and who herself undoubtedly believes with her whole\nheart in the spirit-hypothesis,\u2014-denies that she ever consulted or even\nto her knowledge saw, a Sanscrit grammar. Again, M. Flournoy's\ncareful researches have shown that incidents of the Indian history, or\npseudo-history, on which the narrative of this incarnation turns, are\n1 See Ribot, P\u00abi\/chologie des Sentiments, p. 152.\n\f406 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nundoubtedly derived from a particular passage in a rare and antiquated\nhistory of India by de Marlfes,\u2014which M\"e Smith asserts that she\nnever saw, and which it seems very improbable that she should have\nseen. This knowledge is worked up in a way indicating considerable\nfamiliarity with the East, and quasi-Indian tunes and gestures are\nemployed with great verisimilitude.\nI need not here go into the details of the more modern and\naccessible characterisation of Marie Antoinette.\nIn the facts which I have already given, we have got this problem\nreduced to its narrowest form ; and I shall set forth, as barely possible,\n;i theory which Professor Flournoy has not invoked. I agree with him\nthat the notion of the truth of the Indian romance must be quite\ndismissed. But I do not therefore think it certain that MUe Smith must\nhave unconsciously seen de Maries' history and a Sanscrit grammar.\nOn the contrary, I think it just possible that the knowledge of\nde Maries and of Sanscrit may have been clairvoyantly acquired by\nMlle Smith's subliminal self,\u2014-or even may have been communicated\nto that subliminal self by a spirit which may have been concerned in\nthe composition of these romances. I should defend this apparent\nabsurdity somewhat as follows :\u2014\nIf spirits do act upon human minds, they probably so act sometimes\nto amuse themselves, as well as to please or inform us. I know of no\nevidence, indeed, of their having any power to injure us, but I think that\nthere is a good deal of evidence of tricky, playful interference. I think\nthat a kind of literary impulse to write or act out romances, through\nthe intermediacy of some human being, is perhaps one form of this\nmystifying intervention. I think that traces of such a phenomenon\noccur in the psychical history, for instance, of Mr. Stainton Moses, and\nof a lady quoted in these Proceedings as Miss A. The possibility\ncan hardly be tested ;\u2014but should, I think, be noticed here.\nI pass on from these reincarnational romances to certain minor, but\ninteresting phenomena, which Professor Flournoy calls teleological\nautomatisms. These are small acts of helpfulness\u2014beneficent sywrgies,\nas we might term them, in contrast with the injurious synergies, or\ncombined groups of hurtful actions, with which hysteria has made us\nfamiliar. We have already printed several incidents of this type in our\nProceedings and Journal. (See, for instance, the trivial but instructive\ncase of Mrs. Verrall and the envelopes, Proceedings, Vol. XI., p. 191.)\n\"One day,\" says Professor Flournoy (p. 35), \"Miss Smith, when\ndesiring to lift down a large and heavy object which lay on a high\nshelf, was prevented from doing so because her raised arm remained\nfor some seconds as though petrified in the air and incapable of move\nment. She took this as a warning, and gave up the attempt. At a\nsubsequent seance Leopold stated that it was he who had thus fixed\n\fPart xxxviii.i Pseudo-Possession. 407\nHelene's arm to prevent her from grasping this object, which was much\ntoo heavy for her, and would have caused her some accident.\n\" Another time, a shopman, who had been looking in vain for a\ncertain pattern, asked Helene if by chance she knew what had become\nof it. Helene answered mechanically and without reflection\u2014' Yes, it\nhas been sent to M. J.' (a client of the house). At the same time she\nsaw before her the number 18 in large black figures a few feet from the\nground, and added instinctively, ' It was sent eighteen days ago.'\n[This was in the highest degree improbable, but was found to be\nabsolutely correct.] Leopold had no recollection of this, and does not\nseem to have been the author of this cryptomnesic automatism.\"\nA similar phenomenon has also been noted (p. 87) when warning is\nconveyed by an actual phantasmal figure.\nMlle Smith has seen an apparition of Leopold, barring a particular\nroad, under circumstances which make it probable that M\"e Smith\nwould on that day have had cause to regret taking that route. (Cf.\nApparition seen by lady near open lift ; and warnings to Socrates to\nchange his route. Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 345, and Vol. V., pp.\n540-542.)\nThe next question is as to whether supernormal faculty of any\nkind is manifested in Helene's phenomena. There does appear to be\nsome telepathy (see p. 363, etc.), and of telepathy Professor Flournoy\nspeaks as follows :\u2014\n\" One may almost say that, if telepathy did not exist, it would be\nnecessary to invent it. I mean by this that a direct action between\nliving beings, independently of the organs of sense, is a thing so in\naccord with all that we know of nature that it would be difficult not\nto assume its existence a priori, even were no sign of it perceptible.\nHow could one believe, indeed, that centres of chemical phenomena\nso complex as the nervous centres could find themselves in activity\nwithout transmitting various undulations,\u2014X, Y, or Z rays,\u2014passing\nthrough the skull as the sun passes through glass, and going on to act,\nat any distance, on their homologues in other skulls ? It is a mere\nquestion of intensity.\nil If telepathy is considered strange, mystic, occult, supernormal,\netc., it is because this character has been gratuitously conferred on\nit by making of this imponderable link between organisms a purely\nspiritual communication of soul to soul, independent of matter and of\nspace. That such a metaphysical union does exist I am ready to\nbelieve, but it is to introduce a gratuitous confusion if one substitutes\nthis problem of high speculation,\u2014which abandons the strictly scien\ntific ground and sets aside the principle of psycho-physical parallelism,\n\u2014for the empirical problem of telepathy, which is perfectly concordant\nwith that parallelism and in no way contradicts established science.\"\n\f408 F. \"W. H. Myers. [Supplement,\nNow, of course, it has been obvious from the outset of our re\nsearches that it would be very desirable if we could trace some relation\nbetween telepathy and ether-vibrations. There are doubtless endless\nvibrations waiting to be explained ;\u2014and telepathy is a phenomenon\ngreatly in need of an explanation. The more complex any object is,\nmoreover, the more strangely it will vibrate ;\u2014and the more sensitive\nany object is, the more strangely will it receive and respond to\nvibrations.\nNevertheless when we have said this,\u2014as Sir W. Crookes has said it\nwith great impressiveness {Proceedings, Vol. XII., pp. 348-352),\u2014we\nhave said nearly all that can be said for the vibration-theory of telepathy.\nAnd yet the real difficulties of the subject are only beginning.\nIt is, of course, plain that if we are to get any true notion of telepathy\nwe must in some way generalise from our own petty experiments and\nlimited observations. No one supposes that the few emergent cases\nwhich happen to have become accessible to our view comprise the\nwhole range of what must by its very nature be a great fundamental\nlaw.\nNow the generalisation which the vibration-theory calls on us to\nmake is as follows : Ether-vibrations are constantly emanating from\nevery human brain, and every human brain is capable of receiving such\nvibrations and of representing them in consciousness.\nThese vibrations are assumed to radiate in all directions equally (as\nall ether waves must do), and to be unaffected by earthly distances\nor earthly objects ; but nevertheless only to become perceptible when\nthey impinge upon a brain which is fitted to receive them either by\nemotional sympathy or by some natural sensitivity. Their action on\nthe percipient's brain is assumed to be instantaneous ;\u2014although we\nmay allow some period of latency before they represent themselves in\nhis consciousness. Of course, the more this latency is insisted on, the\nless plausible does the vibration-theory become.\nAgain, the vibration must represent itself to the percipients as a\npattern which must in some way resemble the pattern which emanated\nfrom the agent. Thus, to recur to our early experiments with cards,\nour old friend the two of diamonds is bound to be the two of diamonds\nstill ; or if it cannot come out as the two of diamonds exactly, it yet\nought to get as near it as it can, and to appear, say, as the two of hearts.\nWhen the idea to be communicated becomes more complex,\u2014and most\nideas are more complex than the two of diamonds,\u2014we may fairly allow\na wider range of similitude. The vibration-pattern received is sup\nposed to lx; modified by the recipient brain;\u2014modified often out of any\npictorial, resemblance to any impression which we can suppose the\nagent's brain to have despatched. The great extent of such apparent\nmodification, indeed, does not affect the vibration-theory alone, but any\n\fPart xxxvm.] Pseudo-Possession. 409\ntheory of telepathic impact as opposed to excursive presence, or invasion\non the agent's part. Gurney repeatedly, in Phantasms of the Living,\ndiscussed this topic, and especially that form of difficulty which lies in\nthe habitual appearance of the agent's person to the percipient ;\u2014albeit\nthe agent, at a moment of death or crisis, is not likely to be thinking of\nthe aspect of his own body. Gurney argues, however, that a sense\nof one's own aspect is deeply rooted in all our minds, and may\nnaturally be represented to others as a part of any message which\ncomes from our unconscious strata. But such a theory, difficult in\nany case, has to be greatly strained if we are to suppose that a\npattern of brain-vibrations which for the agent represent, say, the\nshock of the rupture of an aneurism, become for the percipient a\npicture of a smiling gentleman dressed for walking, with great coat\nand cane. (See Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 210, Case of\nN.J. 8.)\nA still greater difficulty for the vibration-theory is presented by\ncollective telepathic hallucinations. It is hard to understand how A\ncan emit a pattern of vibrations which, radiating equally in all direc\ntions, shall affect not only his distant friend B, but also the strangers\nC and D, who happen to be standing near B ;\u2014and affect no other\npersons, so far as we know, in the world.\nThe above points have been fair matter of argument almost since\nour research began. \u2022 But as our evidence has developed, our conception\nof telepathy has needed to be more and more generalised in other and\nnew directions,\u2014still less compatible with the vibration-theory. Three\nsuch directions may be briefly specified here ;\u2014namely, the relation of\ntelepathy (a) to telnesthesia or clairvoyance, (\/;) to\u2022time, and (c) to dis\nembodied spirits, (a) It is increasingly hard to refer all the scenes of\nwhich percipients become aware to the action of any given mind which is\nperceiving those distant scenes. This is especially noticeable in crystal-\ngazing experiments, (b) And these crystal visions also show what, from\nthe strict telepathic point of view, we should call a great laxity of time\nrelations. The server chooses his own time to look in the ball ;\u2014and\nthough sometimes he sees events which are taking place at the moment,\nhe may also see past events,\u2014and even future events. I at least cannot\ndeny precognition, nor can I draw a definite line amid these complex\nvisions which may separate precognition from telepathy, (c) Precog\nnition itself may be explained, if you will, as telepathy from dis-\nemlxxlied spirits;\u2014and this would at any rate bring it under a class of\nphenomena which I think all students of our subjects must before long\nadmit. Admitting here, for argument's sake, that we do receive com\nmunications from the dead which we should term telepathic if we\nreceived them from the living, it is of course open to us to conjecture\nthat these messages also are conveyed on ether-waves. But since those\n\f410 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nwaves do not at any rate emanate from material brains, we shall by\nthis time have got so far from the original brain-wave hypothesis that\nfew will care still to defend it.\nI doubt, indeed, whether we can safely say of telepathy anything\nmore definite than this : Life has the power of manifesting itself to life.\nThe laws of life, as we have thus far known them, have been only laws\nof life when already associated with matter. Thus limited, we have\nlearnt little as to Life's true nature. We know not even whether Life\nbe only a directive Force, or, on the other hand, an effective Energy.\nWe know not in what way it operates on matter. We can in no way\ndefine the connection between our own consciousness and our organisms.\nJust here it is, I should say, that telepathic observations ought to\nsupply us with some hint. From the mode in which some element of\none individual life,\u2014apart from material impact,\u2014gets hold of another\norganism, we may in time learn something of the way in which our\nown life gets hold of our own organism,\u2014and maintains, intermits, or\nabandons its organic sway.\nMost instructive of all will it be if we can obtain telepathy from\ndiscarnate spirits,\u2014and especially if we could get any glimpse of a rela\ntion between their mode of being and the cosmic ether. On this point\nProfessor Flournoy writes as follows (p. 394) :\u2014\n\" It is obvious that the hypothesis of spirits involves no d priori\nimpossibility or absurdity. It does not even contradict, as is sometimes\nsupposed, that fundamental law of physiological psychology\u2014the\npsychophysical parallelism\u2014which insists that every mental phenomenon\nmust have a physical correlative. For in spite of our habit of con\nsidering the molecular or atomic phenomena of the brain, the cata-\nbolism of the neurones,\u2014as the true concomitant of the conscious pro\ncesses, it is quite possible\u2014-it is even probable enough\u2014that these\nmolecular movements do not constitute the ultimate physical term\nimmediately adjoining the mental world (cdtoyant le monde mental),\nbut that the true physical or spatial correlatives of psychological or\nnon-spatial phenomena ought to be sought in the vibrations of that\nimponderable matter, the ether, in which ponderable atoms and mole\ncules are plunged somewhat after the fashion of grains of dust in the\natmosphere.\"\nI quote these words because,\u2014-obvious as their contention must\nseem to all thinking persons,\u2014it is common enough to see phrases used\nas though our notions were still bounded by the molecular;\u2014-as though\nwe did not know, as certainly as we know anything, that the great\nmystery of existence is only just beginning, in that inconceivable world\nof ether, precisely where our utmost analysis fails us, and our mathe\nmatics are reduced to a jungle of infinities and of contradictions.\n\fPut xxxvni.) Pseudo-Possession. 411\nAnd now as to the question of possible telepathy from the dead in\nHelene's case. The instance with most in its favour is described by\nProfessor Flournoy as follows (p. 406) :\u2014\nIn a sitting at my house (February 12th, 1899) M1le Smith has a vision of\na village on a height covered with vines ; she sees a small old man coming\ndown thence by a stony road. He looks likes a \" demi-monsieur \" ;\u2014buckled\nshoes, large soft hat, shirt-collar unstarched, with points rising to his cheeks,\netc. A peasant in a blouse whom he meets bows to him as to a personage of\nimportance ; they talk a patois which H\u00e9lene cannot follow. She has an\nimpression that she knows the village ; but she cannot identify it. Soon the\nlandscape disappears, and the old man, now clothed in white and seen in a\nluminous space [implying that he is in the next world] seems to come nearer.\nAt this moment, as she sits with her light arm resting on the table, Leopold\ndictates with the forefinger, Lower her arm. I obey ; Helene's arm at first\nresists strongly ; then yields at once. She seizes a pencil, and during the\nusual struggle as to the way to hold it [i.e., whether in her own habitual\nfashion,\u2014between forefinger and middle finger, \u2014or in the ordinary way]\n\"you are squeezing my hand too hard ! \" she cries to the imagined little old\nman who, according to Leopold, wishes to write through her;\u2014\"You hurt\nme ; don't press so hard ; what can it matter to you whether it is a pencil or a\npen ? \" Then she drops the pencU and takes a pen, and holding it between\nthumb and forefinger writes slowly in an unknown handwriting, Cliaumontet\nsyndic. Then returns the vision of the village ;\u2014we wish to know its name ;\nand she ends by perceiving a guide-post on which she spells out Chessenaz, \u2014\na name unknown to us. Finally having, at my desire, asked the old man\nthe date when he was syndic, she hears him answer, 1839. Nothing more\ncan be learnt ; the vision disappears and gives place to a possession by\nLeopold, who in his big Italian voice talks at length about various matters. I\nquestion him on the incident of the unknown village and syndic ; his answers,\ninterrupted by long digressions, are to this effect : \"I am looking\u2014\nI turn my thoughts along that great mountain with a tunnel in it whose\nname I do not know [Leopold, \u2014the soi-disant Cagliostro, \u2014who returns\nfrom the 18th century, is naturally not well up in modern geographical\nnames ;\u2014but this is the hill of Fort de l'Ecluse] ; I see the name\nof Chessenaz, \u2014a village on a height, \u2014a road leading up to it. Look\nin that village ; you will find the name [Chaumontet] : try to verify\nthe signature ; you will get a proof that the signature is really that of\nthis man.\"\nI ask him whether he sees all this in H&fene's memories\u2014 \" No \" ;\u2014or\nwhether she has ever been at Chessenaz:\u2014 \"Ask her; she will know; I\nhave not followed her in all her excursions.\"\nHelene, when awake, could give no information. But next day I found\non the map a little village of Chessenaz in the department of Haute-Savoie,\nat 2(5 kilometres from Geneva.\nA fortnight later, Helen sees the vision of the other day reappear ;\u2014the\nvillage, the little old man ;\u2014but accompanied by a cure, who seems intimate\nwith him, and whom he calls \" my dear friend Bournier.\" Leopold promises\nthat this cure will write his name for Helen.\n\f412 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nAt the next sitting in my house, March 19th, I remind Leopold of this\npromise . . . The cure at last takes her hand as the syndic had done,\nand writes very slowly the words Burnier saint.\nI wrote to the Mairie at Chessenaz, and the Mayor, M. Saunier, was\ngood enough to answer me at once. \"During the years 1838 and 1839,\" he\nsaid, \" the syndic of Chessenaz was Jean Chaumontet, whose signature I find\nin various documents of that date. We had also for cure M. Andre Burnier,\nfrom November, 1824, to February, 1841, during which period all the\nactes rfes naissances, etc., bear his signature. But I have found in our\narchives a document with both signatures, which I send you.\"\n[Reproductions of actual signatures, and of signatures given by M11*\nSmith. The handwritings were markedly similar.]\nProfessor Flournoy's first idea naturally was that M1Ie Smith had\nseen at some time or other some acts or documents signed by the\nsyndic or the cure' of Chessenaz, and that these visual impressions had\nreappeared in her somnambulic state, and had served as internal\nmodels for the signatures which she traced in trance.\nCareful inquiry, however, made it clear that M1Ie Smith (whose\nprobity, I may here repeat, is beyond question) had never been at\nChessenaz,\u2014still less consulted its parish archives. Whether the\nhandwriting of its syndics, before the cession of Savoy to France,\ncould ever have fallen under her eyes in some old record or certificate\nbelonging to friends in that neighbourhood is a question incapable of\nabsolute proof.\nAs the matter now stands I cannot claim that any true communica\ntion from the departed has as yet been established for M\"e Smith. Her\ncase is still on the verge of proof.\nAnd here I shall of course be met with the inquiry : WThat influence,\nthen, must the case of M\"\u00b0 Smith have upon your interpretation of\nthe case, say, of Mrs. Piper ? Can you maintain that there is a funda\nmental difference hetween this elaborate case of pseudo-possession, and\nthat other case, so closely resembling it, in which you claim that\nGeorge Pelham was no mere personification effected by Mrs. Piper's\nsubliminal self 1 Have you really a criterion by which to judge the two\ngroups of phenomena ? and can you explain how it is that, if funda\nmentally different, they are superficially so much alike 1\nMy answer to the first question must be, as it has ever been, that we\nhave a criterion,\u2014consisting not in the manner in which the messages\nare given, but in the actual evidential content of those messages them\nselves. I claim that, whereas in Mlle Smith's messages there is hardly\nany real indication of an individual and recognisable focus of memories,\nbelonging to a human person, and such as no other known person\ncould simulate ; in George Pelham's case on the other hand there ix\nsuch indication ;\u2014pushed so far as to render it highly improbable that\nthat focus or chain of memories is decomposable into fragmentary\n\fPan xxxvin.] Pseudo-Possession. 413\nrecollections,\u2014is a mere aggregate of scraps of knowledge telepathi-\ncally gathered from many quarters, and subliminally fused into an\napparent unity. I am, in short, simply more confirmed than ever in\nmy conviction (as against the mere facile admissions of spiritist writers)\nthat a strict and thorough analysis of automatic messages is absolutely\nessential,\u2014and will result in showing the genuineness of a very few of\nthese messages by dint of their intrinsic evidential superiority to all\nthe rest.\nTo the second question asked above,\u2014-as to the explanation of the\nsimilarity between pseudo-possession and true possession, I reply that\nfrom my point of view it was to be expected that such cases should\noccur,\u2014that the action of subliminal phases of personality upon the\norganism should reach a point of close resemblance with the action of\nexternal spirits upon the organism.\nI regard the human organism as an entity whose life, as apart from\nany informing spirit, is beyond our intellectual grasp. Whatever\nindependent life the cells of my organism may possess, I can only\nregard that organism as a machine, which my own spirit habitually\nworks\u2014partly supraliminally, partly subliminally\u2014but which may\nbe partially worked also by some other incarnate spirit or by a\ndiscarnate spirit. Each of these controlling agencies necessarily\ncontrols the organism in much the same way ;\u2014that method being\ndetermined in fundamentals by the structure of the organism itself ;\u2014\nin detail by the supraliminal education which I happen to give to the\norganism. Thus the power of making cries and gestures inheres in the\nstructure of the organism ; I educate this power into speech and\nwriting, which I use for ordinary conscious purposes.\nNow suppose that some submerged phase of my personality gains\nthe power of manifesting itself, it will have to use the accustomed\nmethods. It may not, indeed, be able to use all of them. It may not,\nfor instance, be able to speak. Or it may not have the whole of my\nknowledge at its command. Thus, to take the weakest case of\nsubliminal control, a fraction of myself uses my organism in a dream,\nbut can neither make me write nor make me speak, \u2014although it may\ncause restless gestures. Nor has the dream command over more than\na small fraction of my knowledge ; and the knowledge over which it\nhas command may l)e knowledge taken from a far-back period of\nmy history.\nAnd now suppose that another incarnate spirit telepathically\ninfluences my organism. In order to do this it can use practically the\nsame mechanism which a dream can use. It can affect me with\nsensory hallucinations, or it can prompt me to brief utterances and\ngestures, like those of somnambulism. It cannot, as a rule, do much\nmore than this, as our telepathic cases show. Yet sometimes, especially\n\f414 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\nif the agent is asleep, he can influence the percipient to automatic\nwriting in a rather more prolonged way.\nLet us pass on to the further hypothesis that a discarnate spirit is\ninfluencing the organism. We shall now, at any rate, have something\nlike analogies to which to appeal. Falling back upon known pheno\nmena, we can suggest, for example, that the possessing spirit may act\nlike an extraneous idee fixe, developing into an extraneous secondary\npersonality. It is, indeed, through the working out of this parallel\u2014\nhere merely hinted at\u2014that we may best be able to trace, as I hope\nmay be some day possible, a real continuity between subliminal and\nextraneous influences upon the ordinary personality ;\u2014and to discover,\nperhaps, that spirit-control (or pneumaturgy) may play the same part\nin expanding our ideas of multiplex personality as hypnotism has\nalready played in expanding our ideas of hysteria and somnambulism.\nDeferring such discussion till a more fitting moment, I will con\nclude with a few general reflections which this remarkable case of\nProfessor Flournoy's,\u2014nay, which even some of Dr. Janet's morbid\ncases,\u2014seem to me to suggest to the psychologist who cares to'look beyond\neither the narrowing hospital-walls or the perplexing seance-room.\nThe chief reflection is that we are as yet but in a childish or\nrudimentary stage of our use of the human brain. That brain is in\ntruth (as some one has said) but \" a virtual organ \" ;\u2014an organ en wte\nd'acquisition, which man is slowly learning to use, \u2014but with very\nlittle notion either of how it came to be what it is, or of what it\nultimately may be.\nNo one, indeed, knows how it came to be what it is. No one has\neven plausibly explained that great difference between the simian\nand the savage organ which seems so incommensurate with any observa-\nable difference between the hairy chimpanzee and the hairy Aino.\nSome naturalists argue that much of the savage's brain-power must lie\ndormant ;\u2014must somehow be a mere reserve for the later calls of a\nmore complex existence. If this be admitted, we must surely go on to\nadmit that a large proportion of the brain's capacity is dormant still.\nI do not mean to predict that our race will necessarily include in the\nfuture individual minds more powerful than any minds in the past.\nThis question ultimately depends upon that unknown factor,\u2014the\nnature of the sources from which spiritual life is infused into mortal\norganisms. Let us admit that judging by the last two thousand years\nwe have little ground for confidence in any such advance of the\nhighest individual level. Let us not be rash enough to prophesy\nthat there will ever be a sculptor better than Praxiteles, or a lyric\npoet better than Pindar. Yet the important fact is that the great\nspirits of the past made use only of certain portions of the human\nbrain which had through some historic cause been the first to be\n\fPart xxxvm.] Pseudo-Possession. 415\ndeveloped. The spirits of Pindar or Praxiteles dwelt, so to say,\nin the palace-chambers of their mysterious habitation ; they knew\nnothing of the foundations on which the City of Mansoul was builded,\nor of its treasure-houses in the living rock.\nOf course Helene's intellect, though serviceable enough in common life,\nis not of a calibre to confer new knowledge or delight on educated men ;\nbut for Helene's one-in-a-hundred mind substitute the one-in-a-million\nmind of Louis Stevenson ;\u2014let him dream\u2014not Helene's insipid tale of\n\" Esenale,\" but \" Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" and one sees at once the\nadvantage of relegating voluntary ends to automatic execution,\u2014and so\nat once saving brain-centres from expensive friction and getting the\nneeded thing done (like those reaction-time measurements of Dr.\nJanet's during ecstasy), with a verve and a completeness which conscious\neffort finds it hard to rival. May not that effortless concurrent\nutilisation of all elements of the personality hold ultimately somewhat\nthe same relation to our present painful thought as multiplex tele\ngraphy holds to the old slow and single transmission along the wire I 1\nLet us frankly confess that we cannot in the least tell what the\nbrain will do till we try. The assumed balance of our faculties and\nour environment is altogether chimerical. The environment is unknown\nand infinite, and the faculties must simply be trained as far in every\ndirection as they can. We have attained no position of permanent\nstability, and we have nothing to tell us a priori what will be the next\nfaculties which our race will evolve. And yet popular science some\ntimes speaks as though nearly everything in human nature had been\nobserved already !\u2014as though normality had been defined, aberrations\nclassified, a mass of experience acquired which our successors will only\nhave to work out in detail ! A vain conceit ! a monstrous prematurity !\nRather let us remember that only by an abiding consciousness of our\nown inevitable childishness can we prevent those successors from\nlooking on our religions with pity, and on our science with contempt ;\u2014\nwhile they analyse with a smile our rudimentary efforts at self-realisa\ntion,\u2014remarking \" how hard a thing it was to found the race of man.\"\n1 The same characteristics were observable in M\"<' Smith's other forms of mental\nand bodily effort. \"It may be remarked,\" says Professor Flournoy on this topic,\n' ' that the drawings, embroideries, and other artistic works which were at all times\nthe favourite occupation of her leisure, and in which she excelx, were almost always,\nfrom her childhood onwards, not copies of external models, but products of her own\ninvention, marked with the original and quaint characteristics of her inward pictures.\nMoreover, these pieces of handiwork wrought themselves out under her fingers with\nan ease and a rapidity which astonished herself ;\u2014they worked Ihemacleet, so to say.\"\n\f416 Walter Leaf. [Supplement.\nII.\nREVIEWS.\nThe Scientific Investijiition of Physical Phenomena with Mediums. [Mediumi-\ncheskiya Fizicheskiya Yavleniya i ikh Nauchnoe Izsledovanie.] By M. M.\nPetrovo-Solovovo. (St. Petersburg, 1900.)\nThe name of Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo, now Secretary of the S.P.R. for\nRussia, is well known to our members. He has often contributed to our\npublications, and his judicial and acute mind marks him out for a valuable\ninquirer into psychical problems. We heartily welcome his new book\u2014the\nmost important publication which he has yet essayed in this region. It is\nstrictly confined to a review of the work which has been done in the\nscientific investigation of physical phenomena, and discusses no theories ;\nit hardly even shows leanings. It is, in short, at once a most useful review\nof the reports of previous observers and a criticism of their methods ; and\nit contains, moreover, a certain amount of hitherto unpublished observa\ntions. Most of these refer to the Russian medium, Sambor, but we are\nglad to see a chapter of experiments from the pen of our veteran corre\nsponding member, Mr. Aksakoff, to whom the book is dedicated. To\nSambor we will return presently, first giving a short resume' of the rest\nof the book.\nIn his Introduction Mr. Solovovo tells us at once that he has (most\nwisely) limited his field by rigorously excluding all reports which seemed\ninadequately guaranteed either by the competence of the observers or the\nconditions of their experiments. Mr. Stainton Moses, for instance, appears\nonly in a footnote, on the ground that faith in his reports is solely founded\non personal belief in his veracity. On the other hand, Mr. Solovovo does\nnot exclude experiments with mediums detected in fraud\u2014to have done so\nwould indeed have reduced his work almost to vanishing point ; but while\nduly mentioning such detection in the case of the mediums who have been\nproved fraudulent, he urges that the fact, while calling, of course, for\nredoubled vigilance, does not invalidate experiments where the conditions\nhave been really satisfactory. He discusses very soberly and wisely the\ndifficulties of the inquiry, and, after rejecting all d priori objections to the\npossibility of the asserted phenomena, admits that all previous experi\nmenters, with the single exception of Crookes, have left something to\ndesire ; but this he urges not as an argument against the facts themselves,\nbut as a summons to further and more scientifically conducted experiments.\nThe spirit of his Introduction is, in short, thoroughly scientific ; he himself\nsays that he feels himself further from the thorough-going spiritist than\nfrom the hardened sceptic.\nFrom these preliminary considerations Mr. Solovovo passes to the record\nof the facts themselves. Most of them, if not familiar, are at least accessible\n\fPart xxxvm.i Reviexvs. , 417\nto English readers. He speaks, in chronological order, of de Gasparin's\nexperiments on the movement of tables without contact in 1854, Hare's in\n1855, and the Report of the Committee of the Dialectical Society in 1869\u2014a\nbody of observers, by the way, who seem to be unique in the facility with\nwhich they obtained physical phenomena almost ad libitum with unpaid and\nunprofessional mediums. On this follows an account of Sir William Crookes's\nexperiments, especially those with Home\u2014a series of observations which, as\nMr. Solovovo remarks, still, after thirty years, stands quite alone in its value\nas scientific evidence for the phenomena in question. Next comes an account\nof Zollner's experiments with Slade, with especial reference to \" passage of\nmatter through matter \" in the production of knots on closed loops of string,\nand in this chapter, as confirmatory of Zollner's results, are included the\nRussian experiments with Sambor. Mr. Solovovo then gives a brief account\nof some experiments made in 1883 by Mr. Aksakoff with Mrs. Fox Jen'eken,\nhitherto unpublished. In this case the medium's hands were held by one of\nthe sitters, and were further rendered visible by being laid upon a surface of\nluminous paint. Under these conditions objects at a distance from the\nmedium were moved, a small bell, while floating in the air, was visible owing\nto the luminous paint with which it was coated ; the sitters were touched by\nhands not belonging to any of them\u2014hands of which the faint outline could\nbe seen against the various luminous surfaces, and of which marks were left\nupon smoked paper not within the medium's reach. We then go on to an\naccount of the inquiry into \"direct writing\" on slates carried out by the\nS. P. R., where Mr. Davey's experiments played so remarkable a part. The\nimportance of these Mr. Solovovo fully recognises ; but he is still of opinion\nthat the testimony of Mr. Emmette Coleman and Professor Coues, who say\nthat they saw such writing actually going on before their eyes at a seance\nwith Mrs. Francis, must weigh sufficiently to establish the possibility of the\nphenomenon. And when he urges that those members of the Society who\nhold that Davey's experiments render worthless all evidence dependent on\ncontinuous attention should have refused to investigate Eusapia Paladino, it\nmust be admitted that he has logic on his side. He is however hardly\ncorrect in supposing that this criticism affects Mr. Hodgson, who took part\nin the Cambridge experiments not because he thought them of any value, but\nat the request of the S.P.R., because he was convinced that he could\ndemonstrate their worthlessness.\nAn account of Eusapia herself occupies the last and longest section of the\nbook. Mr. Solovovo himself was present at some fifteen sittings with her,\nfirst at Milan and afterwards at St. Petersburg. His own evidence, however,\nhe modestly relegates to a footnote, admitting that he was not satisfied with\nthe way in which her hands were held on most occasions. But after a full\nconsideration of the results of the Cambridge sittings, he comes unhesitatingly\nto the conclusion that in spite of her proved deceit, many of her phenomena\nare genuine ; his belief is founded mainly upon M. Richet's gradual progress\nfrom scepticism to conviction, and on Mr. Myers's final adhesion after the\nCambridge experiments had led him to avow his disbelief.\nBut the special interest of the book for Western readers lies rather, as I\nhave already intimated, in the detailed accounts of experiments with Sambor.\nSome of these have already appeared in the Annales lies Sciences Psychiques ;\n2 O\n\f418 Walter Leaf. [Supplement.\nbut much at least of the following is, I believe, naccessible except in Russian,\nand deserves translation as a typical sketch of Sambor's phenomena, though\nfrom the point of view of evidence it leaves something to be desired.\nThe first portion of this very remarkable narrative is supplied by Dr.\nFischer from his own notes ; the remarks interposed are in Mr. Solovovo's\nwords.\nSeance of April 13th, 18!i4, *\u00bb \"ie rooms of Mr. S. A. Bezsonojt.\nThe seance began at 9 p.m. A circle of fourteen persons, excluding the\nmedium, joined hands, holding them on their knees. In the middle of the\ncircle stood a small oval table, on which were laid a guitar ; a handbell ; two\nslates tied together with string, the ends of which were sealed to a piece of\ncardboard (a piece of slate pencil was placed between the two) ; a sealed\nenvelope containing a piece of pencil and a clean sheet of paper, one corner\nof which had been torn off and kept by Mr. F. (two members of the circle\nsigned their names on the envelope) ; and a piece of string, both ends of\nwhich were sealed to a card with the seals of two persons present. The\nmedium, having been searched, sat with his back to the fireplace, and Messrs.\nBezsonoff and V. took charge of him. Those present began to sing, and\nthe lights were then put out. By the heavy breathing of the medium it was\nclear that, with brief intervals, he fell some four or five times into a trance,\nduring which luminous stars appeared, chiefly on his right side. The sitting\nlasted for half an hour, and, after an interval, was resumed at 10 p.m. under\nthe same conditions, except that Mr. V.'s place next the medium was taken\nby Mr. Tour. The light was again put out. Luminous stars began to\nappear frequently. The medium stood up in a trance, when there was a\nsudden tinkling on almost all the strings of the guitar. This continued\naudible for some time, as though some one were running fingers over the\nstrings. A piece of glass coated with luminous paint lying on the table was\nthrown to the ground. Then there was a sound as though something dropped\non to the table and thence to the ground\u2014a piece of stearine candle, as\nappeared later. At the same time a musical box standing on the chimney-\npiece behind the medium began to play of itself ; it had run down at the\nbeginning of the seance and had not been rewound. An interval was taken\nat 10.30 and the sittings resumed at 11. Those present rearranged their\nseats and the medium was placed with his back to the door leading to the\nnext room. The same pair as before took charge of the medium, and in\naddition Mr. Tour's right hand was fastened to the medium's left by a tape\nwound twice about the medium's wrist and fastened with fixed knots. Mr.\nBezsonoti' held the medium's right hand in his left. The light was put out.\nAfter a short time the medium began to shiver and move about. He was\nsitting on an Austrian chair, and began gradually to move further and\nfurther away from the table, so that the rest had to extend the chain\ntowards him. The medium suddenly fell to the ground and began to snore\nloudly and groan. The two who were holding his hands declared that he\nrose into the air, drawing their hands after him, and that they could not find\nhis legs. At this time Mr. Tour moved his leg round over the part of the\nfloor where, to judge by the position of the medium's hands, his legs should\nhave been, but the space was vacant. When Mr. Tour mentally desired to\n\fPan xxxvm.] Review. 419\nknow where the medium's legs were, he suddenly felt on the hand which was\nbound to the medium the soles of two feet, which convinced him that the\nmedium was really in the air. On the other side Mr. Bezsonoff declared\nthat the medium was upon him, and was touching him with his hips. The\nmedium then came down to the ground and again rose into the air with his\nchair. Mr. Bezsonoff, who held his right hand, immediately announced this,\nand drew forward his right-hand neighbour's hand for him to feel the chair\nin the air. During all this time there were two or three flashes of stars.\nAfter this Mr. Bezsonoff declared that an Austrian chair was hanging by the\nback on the hand by which he was holding the medium, and had slipped on\nto it from the medium's hand. The medium -then fell with violent con\nvulsions on to a sofa close by, drawing his two neighbours with him, and\nwhile still in a trance called for light. As soon as it was turned on the\nwhole party saw an Austrian chair passed by its back over Mr. Bezsonoffs\nleft hand, with which he was holding the medium's right ; the medium was\nin a trance.\nAfter an interval of half-an-hour, the sitting was again resumed at twelve\nmidnight, with a fresh arrangement of sitters. The medium sat with his\nback to a writing-table, between the same neighbours. Mr. Tour's right\nhand was again fastened to the medium's left. At Mr. Tour's request, the\nguitar was laid on the writing-table outside the circle. The medium sat on a\nheavy chair of ash-wood, which was brought in from the entrance hall. The\nlight was put out and ringing began. One of us expressed a wish to hear\nsounds on the guitar, but stars flashed two or three times behind the medium\ninstead. The medium fell in a trance off the chair, snoring and struggling.\nHis right hand neighbour, Mr. Bezsonoff, declared that, without losing hold\nof the medium, he had got the chair on which the medium was sitting passed\nover his arm by the back ; and the next minute said that the chair had been\ntaken off again. One or two minutes later the medium's left-hand neighbour\ndeclared that the same chair had been passed by the back over his arm which\nwas tied to the medium. At the same instant all the strings of the guitar\ntwanged as though some one had passed a finger over them. The medium\nin trance called for light. When it was turned on, all saw the above named\nchair with its back passed over Mr. Tour's arm which was fastened to the\nmedium. The seance closed at 1 a.m. Among those present was Mr.\nAksakoff.\nDr. Fischer, in a letter to me of July 29th, 189!), adds : \u2014\"The medium\nwas under very careful control, as the chair experiment was not unexpected,\nbut was particularly looked for, though we were by no means sure of success.\nDuring the sitting, while Mr. Tour had his right arm fastened to the medium's\nleft, and in addition was holding the latter's hand in his own, we kept on\nasking him if he was holding on, or noticed any attempt of Sambor's to get\nfree from the fastening. Mr. Tour definitely and categorically asserted that\nno such attempts were made by Sambor, and that he was holding his hand\nvery firmly all the time. The same question was constantly addressed to\nMr. Bezsonoff on the other side, and he too constantly replied that the hand\nof which he had charge never escaped for an instant from his own.\"\nWe have been favoured with a very curious and detailed account of the\nsame phenomena by Mr. Tour. After some general observations on the\n2 o 2\n\f420 Walter Leaf. [Supplement.\ncomposition of the circle which took part in the seances with Sambor in the\nspring of 1894, and on the occurrences observed, Mr. Tour continues :\u2014\n\"One peculiarity of all the experiments carried on with Sambor is his\nextreme restlessness when entranced. He is constantly twitching, cracking\nhis joints, and producing groans which are obviously genuine ; he sways from\nside to side, and slips from his chair to the floor. It is needless to say that\nwith a man of Sambor's youthful and rather powerful frame such experiments\nare very fatiguing for both his neighbours. Moreover, the close atmosphere\nthrows him into a violent perspiration, and the moisture on his wrists, in spite\nof all the efforts of those who are holding him, often enables him to slip them\nfree for a moment. This possibility inevitably undermines an observer's\nfaith in any phenomena where there is room to suspect that the medium's\nhand may have been employed in a moment of freedom. This was emphati\ncally the case with myself in one of the sittings at Mr. Bezsom:.ffs in the\nspring of 1894, when I was holding the medium's hand and Mr. Bezsonoff his\nright.\n\" When, in the midst of Sambor's convulsions and struggles, I suddenly\nfelt a slight pressure on the right arm with which I was holding the medium's\nleft, I immediately allled for light. I then saw, like the rest, an Austrian\nchair hanging by the to]) bar on my right arm below the shoulder. It was\none of the chairs which had been put round the table for the sitters, who had\nbeen obliged to stand up owing to the medium having risen to the ceiling, as\nthey must otherwise have broken the chain.\n\" It is right to point out that, in our previous sitting that evening, a chair\nhad been hung in precisely the same manner on Mr. Bezsonoffs arm ; a fact\nto which some of those present wished to attribute great importance. Now,\nwhen exactly the same thing happened to me, I remembered for certain that\nduring the trance and levitation of the medium his hand had more than once\nslipped out of mine for a moment. Of this I told those who were present,\nexplaining that in my opinion no weight should be laid on the appearance of\nthe chair on my arm, as it might have been seized by the medium during one\nof the moments when his hand was free, and dropped upon my arm when the\ncircle was reformed. I remember that my shameless incredulity was attacked\nwithout mercy by others present, and Mr. Aksakoff and Mr. Pribytkoff, if I\nam not mistaken, tried to convince me, from their experience of spiritism,\nthat similar phenomena were common enough, especially with weak mediums ;\nand that if anyone doubted, we should try to repeat the experiment, but this\ntime with hands bound together, which would do away with all doubt.\n\"I acceIited the proposition with pleasure, and once more we all sat round\nthe table in a circle. I took control of the medium on the left, and my right\nhand and wrist were tied to Sambor's left with a plain new tape, fastened\nwith several knots. Bezsonoff took control of the right side, but his hand\nwas not tied like mine. The light was put out, and we waited.\n\"The usual sparks began to appear, floating in curved lines through the\nair. The medium fell as before into a stormy trance, with convulsive move\nments ; he then rose to his feet, and at this moment I felt some sort of touch\non my right arm near the shoulder. As I could not use my hands without\nbreaking the circle, I bent my head down to the right, and with my temple\nstruck something hard below my shoulder ; this 1 announced, and asked\n\fPartxxxvm.] Review. 421\nfor light. It was turned on, and there, hanging on my right arm, was a\nchair\u2014not a drawing-room chair, but a heavy arm-chair from the hall ; one\nthat had not at the beginning of the seance been in the study, the door of\nwhich had remained all the time carefully closed. The fastening by which\nmy hand was attached to the medium's remained perfectly intact, just as it\nhad been put on ; the knots were perfect, and the efforts with which they\nhad been drawn tight were not trifling, as the livid mark of the tape round\nmy wrist remained visible for several days. The whole of this part of the\nsitting did not hist more than four or five minutes.\n\" Of course I was amazed, and my incredulity was put to shame, though it\nwould not capitulate without an effort. The first idea that flashed across me\nwas that there might have been some remissness on the part of the medium's\nright-hand neighbour, whose hand was not fastened to Sambor's as mine was.\nIn that case the medium, I thought, might have caught the chair (on the\nappearance of which through the closed door of the study I did not dwell)\nwith his right hand, and somehow or other got through the aperture in the\nback, so as to pass it on to my arm. I now sincerely regret the slur which I\nthus cast upon Mr. Bezsonoff, whose interest in the investigation of truth\nwas certainly no less than my own ; but facts or appearances which strike at\nthe root of convictions which have grown up with us from infancy are not to\nbe accepted without a struggle of the inner consciousness. In my blind\nscepticism I tried to pass the back of the arm-chair over Sambor ; but the\nefforts of three of us only succeeded in getting the upper aperture 3i in.\nabove his knee, beginning from the ground ; further up the thighs we could\nnot move it, for the dimensions of the aperture were only 10A x 8jf in. It\nwas perfectly clear that in order to pass the aperture in the chair-back over\nthe body of the medium it would have been necessary to slice off 2 or 3 in.\nof both his sides from shoulders to thighs, and in addition to prune off his\nright arm !\n\"Foiled in this, I had recourse to another supposition: how was the chair\nmade ? Was there any secret flaw in it ] We all set about examining it,\nbut after the most rigorous search could find no ingenious joints or secret\nsprings of any sort. The chair was just a plain, high-backed arm-chair of\nash-wood, such as is commonly to be seen in entrance halls, and sometimes\nin dining-rooms.\n\"There was nothing for it ; scepticism had to sing small and make the\nbest of the fact, however strange at the present stage of our knowledge\nof nature.\"\nMr. Tour concludes with an expression of his conviction that none of\nthe phenomena he saw with Sambor require, or even suggest, any ' ' trans\ncendental,\" supernatural, or spiritistic explanation. He regards them as\nmanifestations of a still unknown force innate in the medium, and perhaps\ncapable of development.\nMr. Solovovo points out that the narrative of Mr. Tour in some points\ndiffers from that of Mr. Fischer, but not in matters which touch the essence\nof the problem. The most noteworthy, of course, is the discrepancy about\nthe chair found on Mr. Tour's arm. In Dr. Fischer's notes, written at the\ntime, this is the chair on which the medium had been placed when the circle\n\f422 Frank Podmore. [Supplement.\nwas formed : in Mr. Tour's, written five years later, it becomes an \"apport,\"\nbrought into the room through a closed door. We have evidently another\ninstance of the tricks played by memory even on the most conscientious\nwitnesses, and a warning of the little value of all that is not set down in\nblack and white at the moment.\nIt only remains to congratulate Mr. Solovovo on the thoroughness and\nskill with which he has marshalled his facts, and on the sobriety and caution\nof his criticism. He has of necessity laid the greatest weight on the per-\nsonal standing and scientific reputation of his witnesses ; but it must not be\nforgotten that no real solid foundation will have been laid for the scientific\nestablishment of these investigations till the mass of them is so great that\nthis personal element is finally eliminated. This will, to all appearance, be\na long task ; but Mr. Solovovo has contributed a valuable stimulus to the\nnecessary patience and perseverance in inquiry.\nWalter Leaf.\nL'Iiicohhh et Us Problemes Psychiques. Par Camille Flammarion-. (Paris,\n1900.)\nM. Camille Flammarion is known in this country not merely as the\nauthor of numerous works on astronomy, scientific and popular, and several\nphilosophical romances, but also as one who has almost from the outset\ntaken a keen interest in the problems of Spiritualism and those other debat\nable phenomena which form the subject matter of psychical research. His\ncird of election to the \" SociSte Parisienne des etudes spirites,\" signed by\nAllan Kardec himself, is dated, he tells us, November, 1861. Between\nthirty and forty years ago his name was very familiar in this country as that\nof a scientific man who had boine testimony to the reality of the physical\nphenomena of Spiritualism and as an adherent of the Reincarnation doctrine\nthen current among the French Spiritists. And if his utterances on such\nmatters have of late years been less frequent and less pronounced, it is not\napparently from any diminution of his general interest.\nThe present work contains the results of an appeal, avowedly suggested\nby our own Census of Hallucinations, inserted in the Annates Politiquea et\nLitteraires and other Parisian papers. The questions, slightly differing from\nthose employed in our own census, which were addressed to the readers of\nthe Aniudes, ran as follows :\u2014\n(1) Haee you, at aiij time, experienced wl\/kh awake, a clear impression of\nseeing a human being, or hearing him, or being touched bg him, without being\nable to refer thix impression to any knaicn cause f\n(2) l)id such impression coincide with a death'\nIn the event of having had no such impression, readers were asked to\nwrite No on a postcard, and sign it with name or mitials.\nIn the result M. Flammarion received 4,280 replies\u20142,456 negative and\n1,824 affirmative. Of these latter he has selected several hundred for\npublication in the present work.\nOf course, in writing (p. 88) that his questionnaire is analogous to the\nCensus of Hallucinations conducted by a Committee of the S.P.R.,\nM. Flammarion is under a misconception. The objects achieved by that\n\fPart xxxviii.] Reviews. 423\nCensus were, no doubt, manifold ; but two of the primary aims were to\nascertain the proportion of sane persons who had experienced hallucinations,\nand of such hallucinations to ascertain the proportion which coincided with\nsome outside event, chiefly death. It is obvious that neither of these aims\nis met by M. Flammarion's questionnaire. Clearly a very small proportion\nof those who had had no hallucinatory experience would spend two sous and\nsome trouble on the despatch of a postcard. And, again, of those who had\nexperienced hallucinations, such whose hallucinations were, on the face of\nthem, significant, would naturally be much more likely to take the trouble\nto write them out for the gratification of a stranger. Our own work in the\nCensus has, of course, familiarised us with these considerations ; but\nM. Flammarion has not apparently realised their importance, for in one\nplace (p. 222) we find him arguing as follows :\u2014\n\" If these things were hallucinations, illusions, freaks of the imagina\ntion, the number of those not coinciding wilh a death would be considerably\ngreater than the number which do so coincide. Now, we find the contrary\nhas been the case. My inquiry proves it to demonstration. I asked my\nreaders to be good enough to send me all cases, whether coincidental or not.\n[Of the cases sent] there were not more than seven or eight per cent, of\napparitions without coincidences. Precisely the reverse ought to have been\nthe case if we were dealing with hallucinations.\"\nThe last sentence puts the case in a nutshell. The reverse ought to have\nbeen the case, and if M. Flammarion's inquiry had been a real census, he\nwould no doubt have found that the reverse is the case, in France as in\nEngland.\nIt must sound ungracious thus to criticise a book which is a substantial\nand most acceptable contribution to our knowledge of this obscure subject.\nBut so much was necessary at the outset ; and before proceeding to quote\nsome of the illustrations of telepathy given in the book, some further\nwords of caution are necessary. M. Flammarion, as he tells us, received\nover 1800 affirmative answers. The mere work of reading through and\nassorting this mass of correspondence must have been considerable. It\nwould clearly have been a most laborious task for one man to undertake the\nfurther correspondence and minute inquiries necessary to raise these\npreliminary accounts to the evidential standard which the S.P.R. has learnt\nin the course of eighteen years' investigation to set bofore itself. The\nappeal was issued only in the spring of last year. If M. Flammarion had\nundertaken, singlehanded, to write in all cases where necessary for further\ndetails, to examine into the question of other hallucinations experienced\nby the percipients, to obtain corroborative evidence, to verify dates, to\ninterview in person the more important witnesses, and in short to do all\nthat we have thought it necessary to do in the course of our inquiries, the\nresult of his labours could not have been published until far on in the first\ndecade of the coming century. We must be grateful to him that he has\ndone what he could, and we must remember that no other writer probably on\nthe same lines would have effected so much. I spoke just now of corre\nspondents being reluctant to take the trouble of writing out their\nexperiences for a stranger. But it was no doubt precisely because M.\nFlammarion is not a stranger to them that these 1,800 persons who have\n\f424 Frank Pod-more. [Supplement.\nnever seen him in the flesh have been willing to do so much. They have\nread his works, they have found profit in his luminous and vivid descriptions\nof the vast mechanism of the heavens, and delight in the fairy tales \u00ab.t\nScience and the glimpses of unimagined worlds which he has given to them.\nAnd having received bo much they have been glad to make such return as\nwas possible.\nExcluding cases quoted from Phantasms of the Living and other public\nsources, M. Flammarion has given us no less than 157 cases of apparitions\ncoinciding with a death. Fifteen of them were related to him by persons of\nhis acquaintance ; the remainder were sent in answer to his questionnaire.\nOf the 157 cases the greater number are naturally second or th.rd hand, and\nmany are introduced by such phrases as \" When my maternal grandfather,\nwho died in 1882 at the age of eighty, was a young man . .\" Some are\npurely traditional. Again, a large number of the first hand cases are\nconcerned simply with inarticulate noises, such as raps, clangs and heavy\nthumps, which are afterwards found to correspond in time with a death.\nSuch noises, as not being prima facie of human origin or necessarily\nsuggesting a human presence, were excluded by the terms of our own Census\nquestion and might equally have been held to be excluded by the terms of\nthe questions already quoted. There remain perhaps a score of first-hand\ncases relating to visions or voices definitely suggesting a human presence.\nThe following is one of the cases received from his own acquaintances which\ninduced M. Flammarion to undertake his more extended inquiry.\n\"III. (pp. 70, 71).\u2014M. Andre Bloch, a young musician of great talent,\nholder of the prix de Rome and a member of the Astronomical Society of\nFrance, sent me quite recently the following account of an incident of the\nsame kind, which happened in 1896\u2014only the other day, that is (Cest\nd'hier) :\u2014\n\" Dear Master, \u2014In June, 1896, during the two last months of my stay\nin Italy, my mother came to join me in Rome. She lodged close to the\nAcademy of France in a family boarding-house in the Via (Jregoriana, where\nyou yourself lodged. As, at that time, I still had a piece of work to\ncomplete before returning to France, my mother went sight-seeing in the\ncity alone, m order not to interrupt me, and only joined me for luncheon at\nthe Villa M\u00e9dicis towards noon. One day, however, I saw her come in,\nabout eight o'clock in the morning, quite upset. On questioning her. she\nreplied that, whilst dressing, she had suddenly seen, close to her, her nephew\nRem'' Kraemer, who looked at her and said laughing, ' Oh ! yes, I am really\ndead.'\n\" Being very much frightened at this apparition, she had hastened to\njoin me. I soothed her as well as I could, and then I kept up a conversa\ntion on other topics.\n\" A fortnight afterwards we returned to Paris, after having travelled\nthrough part of Italy, and we then heard of the death of my cousin Rene,\nwhich had taken place on Friday, June 12th, 1896, in the flat in which his\nparents lived, 31, rue de Moscou. He was fourteen years of age.\n\"Thanks to a certain piece of work on which I was engaged at the time\nof my mother's entrance, I was able to ascertain the date and even the hour\nof the incident.\n\fPart xxxvin.] Reviews. 425\n\u2022'Now on that day, my little cousin, who had been ill for several days\nwith peritonitis, began the struggle with death at about six o'clock in the\nmorning and died at noon, after having several times expressed a wish to\nsee his aunt Bertha, my mother.\n\" It is to be noticed that not a word had been said to us of my cousin's\nillness in any of the numerous letters which we received from Paris. It\nwas well known that my mother had a special affection for this child, and that\nshe would have returned to Paris had he had but the slightest finger-ache.\nThey had not even telegraphed the news of his death to us.\n\"I must add that, owing to the difference of longitude, when it ie six\no'clock in the morning at Paris the clocks at Home indicate the hour of\nseven, and it was exactly at that time that my mother had this vision.\n\" ANDItfi Bloch.\n\" 11, Place Malesherbes, Paris.\"\nThe case, it will be seen, depends upon a single memory. But it is\nfairly recent (M. Flammarion's view of what constitutes quite recent\nevidence differs, it will be seen, from ours) ; and, though technically\nsecond hand, it is for evidential purposes, at any rate as regards the bare\nfact i if the vision and of the impression made by it on the percipient, on a\npar with a first hand case, since the narrator heard of the vision before he\nreceived news of the death.\nNo. XVII. is an interesting case and is again recent. M. Georges\nMerlet, Juge de paix at Malesherbes, on the evening of the 1st December,\n1898, at 9.30, experienced a violent and unaccountable panic which appears\nto have produced a quite unusual impression upon him. The next morning\nhe received news of the death of an aged uncle, and immediately connected\nit with the panic of the previous evening. The death had in fact occurred\nat 9.30 p.m. Unfortunately the attack of panic, in itself perhaps not\nunique, or sufficiently distinctive, was not connected at the time with the\ndeath. Moreover, as the Oxford Tutor said, we could wish that it had been\na nearer relative.\nThe next case is less recent, but attested by a second witness.\n\" XIX. (p. 97).\u2014On December 4th, 1884, at half-past three in the\nmorning, I was wide awake, and had just got up, when I saw v, vy\ndistinctly the apparition of my brother Joseph Bonnet, ensign in the\n2nd regiment of Spahis, in garrison at Batna, in the province of Constantino\n(Algeria). At that time he was engaged in the manoeuvres, and we did not\nknow exactly where he was. My brother kissed my forehead, I felt a\ncold shiver, and he said to me very distinctly, 'Good-bye, Angela, I am dead.'\nVery much touched and quite upset, I woke my husband at once, saying\n' Joseph is dead ; he has just told me so.'\n\" As that day, December 4th, was my brother's birthday (he had com\npleted his thirty-third year) and we had been talking of this anniversary the\nevening before, my husband assured me that this apparition was only\ninspired by my own thoughts and considered it the result of nervous\nexcitement.

But the incident again depends upon a single memory. It\nshould perhaps be pointed out, however, that in a case of this kind it is\ndifficult to estimate and quite easy to exaggerate the weight which the\ncorroboration of the second witness really adds to the original statement.\nWith members of the same household constantly occupied with the same\ninterests and having to a large extent the same common memories, any\ncircumstances which affect the memory of the original witness will tend to\nsome extent to affect the memory of him who corroborates. If, in the case\nwhich follows, the vision had grown more definite with years, if even\nthe identification of the vision with the percipient's mother was not made\nuntil some days later, it is possible that the husband would still be found to\ncorroborate the account given in the text. Probably few husbands could\nafford to disappoint legitimate expectations in such matters.\n\"XXX. (pp. 104-5).\u2014My dear mother died on Saturday, April 8th,\n1893. The previous Wednesday I had received a letter from her, in which\nshe told me that she was not suffering very much from her heart complaint,\nand spoke of an expedition she had made on Saturday, April 1st, near our\ncountry house at Wasselonne. I had been intending to go out on that\nSaturday, April 8th. I dined quietly at noon, but towards two o'clock a\nterrible fear possessed me. I went upstairs to my room and threw myself\ninto an armchair where I burst into sobs. I saw my mother lying on her bed,\nwith a cap of gathered muslin on her head, which I had never seen her\nwear, and dead. My old servant, uneasy at not hearing me moving about,\ncame up to me, and was surprised to see me in such despair. I told her\nwhat I had seen, and how afraid I felt. She would have it that my nerves\nwere out of order, and persuaded me to finish dressing. I went out of the\nhouse, hardly knowing what I was doing.

M. Flammarion's own attitude to the\nsubject has already been partly indicated. To begin with, he does not\nconsider that the apparitions of which specimens have been quoted above\n\f432 Frank Podmore. [Supplement.\nare rightly classed as Hallucinations. We know what hallucinations are, he\nsays, and we know how they are caused, and these aie not of them nor do\nthey proceed from similar causes (p. 221). He objects therefore to the\ntitle \"Hallucinations telepathiques,\" given to the French abridgment of\nPhantmrns of the Living, as \" titre inexact et denature \" (p. 223) ; he objects\nequally to Mr. Myers' felicitous coinage \"veridical hallucinations\" (p. 248).\nBut his own conception of the nature of these apparitions is a little difficult\nto grasp. He has no doubt that they are caused by some action of the\ndying man's brain ; that this action (psychic force) gives rise to movements\nin the ether which are propagated to a distance like any other ethereal\nmovements : and affect kindred brains. This transformation of psychic\nforce into ethereal undulations, may, he suggests, be analogous to the trans\nformation of sound into electric waves, and back again into sound, in the\ntelephone (p. 373).\nLater, after explaining that the object of his researches is to ascertain\nwhether the human soul has an existence independently of the body and\nsurvives its destruction (p. 564), he proceeds to consider which of the forces\nknown to us have an independent existence. Light, heat and sound are\nclearly not independent existences\u2014they are only sensations produced in\nour organism by ethereal or aerial movements. But electricity, he is inclined\nto think, probably exists as a real entity, the ether being an electrical\nsubstance (p. 571), and in considering the physical effects produced on\nkindred brains by the apparitions, he finds himself compelled to conclude\nthat \"something\" has proceeded from the dying man. Proximately, no\ndoubt, the \"something \" is but an ethereal vibration, as in the case of light.\nBut the vibration must be caused, and he is satisfied that no anatomist or\nphysiologist would venture to say that the cause would be found in the\nphysical structure of the brain (p. 573).\nBut it may be argued, as against M. Flammarion, my organism will affect\nnot merely a kindred organism, but any man with the normal complement of\nsenses, or any appropriate mechanical receiver, at a distance which is limited\nonly by the imperfection of our optical and other physical instruments.\nWhat is the difference between the vibrations starting from me which affect\nmy friend's eye, and those equally starting from me and equally transmitted\nby the ether, which, ex hypothesi, affect my friend's brain direct ? If the\none of the two vibrations is of the earth, gross, mechanical and subject to\nthe law of the conservation of energy, how can we prove that the other is\nnot also ? Or, conversely, if these prove immortality and the supremacy of\nthe soul of man, hive not those an equal claim to give like testimony? In\ntruth M. Flammarion can give no reasonable grounds for the faith that is\nin him. He distinguishes between the origin of the one set of effects and\nthe other; but he has no argument to offer. \"On sent la une proprtete'\ninconnue, non de l'organisme physique, mais de l'etre pensant (p. 573),\nand again \"Nous ne pouvons nous laisser guider dans nos jugements cIue par\nle sentiment intime qui resulte en nous de la discussion des phenomenes \"\np. 574).

By\nC. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D. Aberd. Fourth Edition, revised and enlarged.\n(Bailliere, Tindall and Cox, 20, 21, King William Street, Strand,\nLondon, 1900.)\nCure by suggestion is perhaps the oldest of all methods of treatment.\nIn the childhood of all races the few simples used for their known power as\ndrugs pure and simple were largely overshadowed by charms, incantations,\nand fantastic methods of cure which depended for their effect on their\npower over the imagination of the patient. In those early times the priest\nand physician were usually one and the same, and it followed that, until quite\nlately, all such methods of cure have been in the hands of priests, soothsayers,\nwhite witches and the numerous tribe whose interest it was to keep the idea\nof the supernatural before the minds of their patients as the true means of\ncure. In the present day, even in the most civilised parts of the world, we\nstill have miraculous cures at grottoes and wells, Christian Scientists, faith\nhealers, and quack healers of every description. It is a matter of regret\nthat almost up to the present medical men have been so much prejudiced by\nthe element of obvious quackery and humbug surrounding these cures as to\nconfound with them the results obtained by students of psycho-therapeutics.\nThe comparatively recent emergence of the art of medicine from empiricism\nor charlatanism has perhaps made the present professors of the art morbidly\nsensitive to anything which smacks of that dark age, and which it is difficult\nto analyse by the scientific methods they have now become accustomed to.\nIt was inevitable in starting a new study of so difficult a nature that\nnumerous mistakes should be made and theories promulgated which were\nsoon to be proved untenable. The English medical school has hardly made\na fair allowance for this. Part of the reason may be that, whereas in\nGermany and France large numbers of works on the subject have appeared,\nin England the books which have debated the subject in a fair and equable\nmanner have been but few, and some of the most notable are by foreign\nauthors. Dr. Lloyd Tuckey's volume states the case for psycho-therapeutics\nin a manner which should convince an impartial critic of the value of its\nmethods. He justly insists on the importance of such a powerful aid to the\nphysician's means of combating disease. His quotation of Professor Pitres\nis apt and to the point. \"Be physicians, gentlemen, and not hypnotisers,\nbut learn to apply hypnotism and be ready to use it in suitable cases.\"\nWith all the resources of latter-clay scientific research at his disposal, there\nstill remains a large field of disease which is the despair of the physician.\nA large section of it consists of diseases caused by the imagination or by\ncauses which have had their first effect on the imagination. These, as is\ntruly pointed out, are anything but imagmary diseases. It is in these cases\nthat the method of treatment by suggestion strikes at the root of the evil in\na manner that no other kind of treatment can approach. And here a point\non which Dr. Lloyd Tuckey lays stress may well be emphasised. This\nmethod does not weaken the will-power of the patient, but strengthens his\npower of self-control. The dangers of hypnotism have always been a\nbugbear which, like many others, requires but careful investigation to\nreduce to a very small quantity.\n2 H\n\f434 G. F. Roger8. [Supplement.\nThough the main use of hypnotism must be in diseases of a psychical\nnature, yet, as Dr. Lloyd Tuckey points out, the influence of the mind over\nthe processes of the body is so great that we may fairly look to it as a most\nvaluable reinforcement in the treatment of many other diseases. We all\nknow the value of personality in a doctor's curative powers, and it would be\nwell if the influence of mind over body were a subject which all medical men\nhad a scientific knowledge of. The characteristics enumerated by Dr. Lloyd\nTuckey as necessary for the successful practice of psycho-therapeutics for\ncurative pur[K)8es are those which every medical practitioner should possess:\u2014\n\"Firm will, unlimited patience, calm temperament, tact, medical knowledge\nand judgment.\"\nThe common belief that hysterical and mentally unstable people are\nspecially good subjects for hypnosis is here well refuted,\u2014experience shows\nthat strong, healthy, intellectual men are easily influenced, though those\nalso who are sick and reduced in bodily strength are peculiarly suscep\ntible. The value of the different methods of sending to sleep is discussed ;\nthe less strain, the better. No mention, however, is made of the method of\ninducing sleep by passes, which is of all methods the one that imposes least\nstrain on the subject. Charcot's interpretation of the hypnotic state and\nmethod of inducing it is in my opinion rightly condemned in favour of that\nof the Nancy School. Many interesting cases are given of the effect of hypno\ntism on various diseases. It is extremely satisfactory to note the number of\ndipsomaniacs cured, one third of two hundred cases. The shortness of time\nrequired, \u2014one month,\u2014also contrasts favourably with the length of residence\nfound necessary in homes for the cure of such cases. The relegation of the\npractice of hypnotism to the hands of medical and other scientific men is,\nwith justice, strongly advocated.\nIn a treatise on the therapeutic side of hypnotism, the purely psychical\nside has necessarily been left in the background. Still, to the student of\nPsychical Research, Dr. Lloyd Tuckey's book affords many valuable hints on\npsychology. I do not know whether all would agree with the statement\n\"that vivid consciousness only exists when nervous impulses are sent\nthrough new or little-used channels.\" Education, or the establishment of\nthese paths as easily travelled tracts, is, I think, required to attain a vivid\nconsciousness of festhetic feelings.\nIn the course of so many years' familiarity with the hypnotic state, it is\ninevitable that many of the psychical phenomena which often accompany it\nmust have come under Dr. Lloyd Tuckey's cognizance. Although he rightly\ndeprecates experiment on patients, yet I am sure he must have accumulated\nenough material for a treatise on the workings of the psychical side of man\nwhich would make a very desirable companion to the present lucid work on\nPsycho-Therapeutics.

Even the most\n\fPart xxxviiio Reviews. 435\nnormal, however, need have no apprehensions in approaching Mr. Lowell's\nvery lively and entertaining volume, while students of the curious class of\nphenomena described,\u2014phenomena of which there are traces in varying forms\nfrom earliest times to the present day, and in all countries from farthest\nEast to farthest West,\u2014will find the subject dealt with in a manner showing\nmuch care and observation. Most Orientals are apt, as a rule, to withhold\ntheir marvels from the eyes of strangers; in Japan, however, to judge from\nMr. Lowell's experiences, there seems to be but little of such reticence. So\nreadily indeed was he welcomed by the priests of all sects to the performance\nof their sacred mysteries, that it is a matter for astonishment that the wide\nspread system of induced divine possession which he was thus enabled to\nwitness should have waited until now for investigation. Mr. Lowell even\nsupposes that the very existence of the system was unknown to foreigners\nuntil he himself, as the result of a chanco encounter on the summit of the\nsacred mountain Ontake, was led to explore it. While practised also among\nthe Buddhists, Mr. Lowell is inclined to trace the origin of these esoteric\nrites to Shinto, the primitive religion, which, for many centuries displaced by,\nand intermingled with, imported Buddhism, is now, as a consequence of the\nnationalist movement of 1867, restored in a purified form to popular favour.\n\"Shinto,\" he says, \"is the Japanese conception of the Cosmos. It is a com\nbination of the worship of nature and their own ancestors ... A lack\nof psychic development has enabled these seemingly diverse elements to fuse\ninto a homogeneous whole. Both, of course, are aboriginal instincts. Next\nto the fear of natural phenomena, in point of primitiveness, comes the fear of\none's own father, as children and savages show. But races, like individuals,\ntend to differentiate the two as they develop. Now, the suggestive thing\nabout the Japanese is that they did not do so. Filial respect lasted, and by\nvirtue of not becoming less, became more, till it filled not only the whole\nsphere of morals, but expanded into the sphere of cosmogony. To the\nJapanese eye, the universe itself took on the paternal look. Awe of their\nparents, which these people could comprehend, lent explanation to dread of\nnature, which they could not. . . . The thunder and the typhoon,\nsunshine and the earthquake, were the work not only of anthropomorphic\nbeings, but of beings ancestrally related to themselves. In short, Shinto,\ntheir explanation of things in general, is simply the patriarchal principle\nprojected without perspective into the past, dilating with distance into\ndeity.\" Hence the union of the Japanese and their gods into a kind of family\nwhole, each section standing on terms of more or less intimate intercourse\nwith the other, \u2014truly a communion of the saints. The gods vouchsafe them\nselves daily to the people and are ever ready to oblige with small services,\neither by way of working a miracle or so when required for the entertain\nment or edification of their children and admirers, or by directly entering\ninto possession of one of them in order to converse with and impart useful\nspiritual information to the rest. It is with these miracles and these posses\nsions that Mr. Lowell's book mainly deals. Of the former, it is clear that\nthe author does not think much. The chief forms of miracles, or god-arts,\nare the ordeal by hot water ; the ordeal by hot coals\u2014a rite very similar to\nthe fire-walking of Fiji recently written on by Mr. Andrew Lang ; the\nwalking on edges of sharp swords ; and the calling down of fire from heaven\u2014\n2 h 2\n\f436 Everard FeUding. [Supplement.\nto light a pipe or other useful end. So gracious are the gods that, while\nusually reserving these manifestations of divine skill for stated festivals,\nthey are perfectly willing, by private treaty with their priests, to perform\nthese prodigies to order, at any time or place that may be convenient.\nWith a little good will, and perhaps a slight tendency to suggestively or\nexpectationally induced amesthesia, a tougher cuticle, and perhaps\u2014\nfor the more sure performance of the last-named miracle\u2014a convenient\nburning-glass, Mr. Lowell hints he could have done just as well him\nself, given a similar audience. A good stout sole and some useful skill\nto the thaumaturge ; a good thick skull to everybody else ; and the gods\nwill work many marvels.\nSo much for the miracles. In the case of the possessions, or indueed\nincarnations, the problem is more obscure. They are practised by many\ndifferent sects, each with its own rites and formula; and its own habitual\nphenomena. It is not given to every one to become the home of a god, and\nhe who would achieve it must undergo an apprenticeship, long or short,\ntoilsome or easy, according to the purity of the apprentice,\u2014such purity\nbeing measured according to his initial capacity for complete vacuity of\nmind. In the Shinshiu sect a kind of Sunday-school for boys and girls\nis held, in which instruction is given in the art of temporarily becoming god\nto the most pious young people of the parish,\u2014a Delphic Academy, in fact,\nfor the cultivation of self-hypnotisation. The phenomena develop gradually.\nAn apt pupil begins with convulsions : the god manifests himself by causing\nthe subject to engage in violent gymnastic performances, somersaults over a\ntable, climbing round a cornice, and so forth. As education proceeds he\nbegins to grunt ; later, the grunts become articulate ; then comes intelligible\nspeech ; and finally, a distinct personality is developed with recognisable\nattributes distinguishing it from other and succeeding personalities. For a\nfull account the reader must refer to Mr. Lowell's book. The similarity of\nthe phenomena with those attending the performances of Western mediums\ndominated by \"spirit\" controls is very close.\nAnd the explanation ? After showing the educative effect on the trance\nstate of the dominant idea, of the expectancy of the subject, Mr. Lowell\ntraces the resemblance of the personality developed to the personality so\nexpected. The subject believes he will become a god\u2014and gradually a god\nhe becomes. The subject has certain initial ideas, simple and vague enough,\nof the behaviour of gods, \u2014and the gods behave just so. A long process of\nself-annihilation has ended by annihilating self ; the ideas are habitual,\ninherited, racial ; and the god is the personification of the racial idea.\nCould we wholly annihilate all individual abnormality, could we have the\nperfectly normal man for subject, \"we should, as the trance state deepened\nand the man lost himself, see him lose, first, his individual characteristics,\nthen his family traits, then the habits of his class, and so down, till only the\nbroadly human ones survived. The trance state would undo what evolution\nhas done, and return to us a primeval savage in the body of an end-of-the-\ncentury man.\" The man has become his own ancestor! \"And so,\" says\nMr. Lowell, with joy at his triumphant paradox, which will come as a shock\nto such as have not foreseen the end of his nimble reasoning, \"this lands\nus . . . at an unexpected conclusion, to wit, that these gods are really\n\fPart xxxviii.] Reviews. 437\nwhat they claim to be. . . . We are viewing the actual incarnation\nof the ancestral spirit of the race. ... If these, his [the subject's]\nancestors were gods in the past, gods they are that descend to embodiment\nto-day.\"\nThis is very pretty, yet one cannot but feel that for this bold stroke\nMr. Lowell has sacrificed the construction of a theory to account, not\nonly for Japanese possessions, but for all other allied phenomena. Dr.\nNevius examined them in China, and called them devils ; Dr. Hodgson\nin America, and there they were discarnate spirits. Is Mrs. Pipor nothing\nbut her own great-grandmother ?

It is written in an interesting, lucid,\nand easy style, contains a good deal of information well-arranged and in a\ncompact form, and is for the most part animated by a spirit of reasonable\nand scientific curiosity, which seems to aim at fairness and to fall short of it\nonly occasionally and in consequence of the difficulty of stating a complicated\ncase in so limited a space. Dr. Lehmann is commendably free from the\nvirus of apriorism and the habit of jumping at conclusions without investiga\ntion ; he does not, as so many scientists do, hold that faith in the infallibility\nof ' science' (and of himself as its exponent) is a substitute for works, and his\ningenious methods of experimentally testing and illustrating the assertions\nof others often make real contributions to the subject. In fact he shows so\nmuch of the spirit of the true psychical researcher that one is disposed to\nwelcome him among the select band of experimental psychologists who have\nhad the good sense and the courage to take to psychical research. Un\nfortunately, however, this is not quite possible ; for owing either to his\nearly training or to a cautious deference to popular and scientific prejudice,\nDr. Lehmann occasionally lapses into crudities of judgment for which\nthe bulk of his narrative and his admissions elsewhere hardly prepare\nthe reader.\nTo give a few flagrant examples. In his historical survey of ancient sorcery\nthe Jews receive a ' favoured nation ' treatment which it would be hard to\njustify on scientific grounds. Per contra in his preface Dr. Lehmann takes up\nquite a comic and Canute-like attitude of one stemming the rising tide of\nsuperstition Yet in the rest of hia book he is largely occupied in showing,\nwith great skill and success, how most or all of these superstitions arose as\nwell-meant, though erroneous, attempts at a scientific explanation of\nphenomena. Again in his final paragraph he warns us that the modern\n' occultists ' (among whom he seems for the moment to include the S. P. R.,\nalthough he ordinarily makes much and appreciative use of its work) have\nburdened their consciences with a terrible responsibility for the new super\nstitions, to which he fears the new conceptions of telepathy, subliminal\n\f438 F. C. S. Schiller. [Supplement.\nconsciousness, etc., will lead. Yet in the body of his work he found these\nnew conceptions useful and even indispensable. He admits (p. 462) that\nthere is no intrinsic absurdity in the assumption of telepathic forces, and,\non his own showing, their assertion has at least enriched science by the\ndiscovery (made by himself) of \" involuntary whispering.\" As for the sub\nliminal, he is constantly compelled to have recourse to it or its equivalents\nin explaining hypnotic phenomena, automatisms, etc. Not that he likes it :\nindeed he has to explain (p. 374 note) that he prefers to use the term\n'unconscious' in such cases just because unconscious ideas or states of\nconsciousness are sheer nonsense (!), while 'subliminal' and ' subconscious '\n(though intrinsically preferable, cf. p. 431) imply theories. Are we to infer\nfrom this that it is scientific to adopt a nonsensical, and superstitious to\nadopt a workable formula ?\nIt would seem then that of Dr. Lehmann as of Dr. Faust it must be said\n\" Zicei Seelen wohnen, ach, in seiner Bnist!\"\nand if in this review attention is mainly directed upon the utterances of the\nless admirable of these two souls, the reason assuredly is that it is more\nprofitable to the S. P. R. (and perhaps also to Dr. Lehmann) to discuss\npoints of difference rather than of agreement, and not any desire to detract\nfrom the feeling of respect in reciprocating which the S. P. R. may well\nimitate Dr. Tiehmann's handsome references to its own work.\nSingling out points for criticism on this principle, I may mention first\nDr. Lehmann's attempt to invalidate Sir Wm. Crookes's evidence as to the\nphenomena observed with Home. His method of doing this is to quote,\nagainst Sir Wm. Crookes's accounts in the Quarterly Journal of Science, the\noriginal notes published in the Proceedings, Part XV. (Vol. VI.), p. 98.\nBetween these two versions, he holds, such discrepancies exist as to justify\nthe conclusion (1) that Crookes's experiments are not rigorously scientific\nbut a product of his imagination (p. 270, 273) and (2) that he either had no\ninkling of the importance of the circumstances which were omitted in his\nfirst account, or else that he was guilty of conscious deception.\nI own that it passes my comprehension how Dr. Lehmann should have\narrived at conclusions of such gravity from premisses so flimsy as those\nwhich he adduces. For the two accounts correspond so completely in all\nessentials that it seems to me a gross exaggeration to speak even of dis\ncrepancies between them, and the only legitimate inference would seem to\nbe the very obvious and harmless one that the first account was a highly\ncondensed, and not a eerbatim, account of what occurred.\nBut in condensing his report Sir Wm. Crookes was only availing himself\nof the universal privilege of all competent scientific observers, who take it\nfor granted that they may be trusted not to omit any material circumstance\nfrom their descriptions. No doubt in this case, as in all psychological\nexperimentation, it would have been better to have diverged from ordinary\nscientific practice by publishing absolutely complete records, but then Sir\nWm. Crookes wrote long before the S. P. R. had impressed on the scientific\nworld the need for such quixotic caution, and, by producing what Dr.\nLehmann himself calls (p. 342) \"one of the most interesting series of\nexperiments which experimental psychology has to show,\" had rendered the\nscientific world alive to the possibilities of mal-observation in such matters.\n\fPart xxxviii.i Reviews. 439\nNo doubt it was this change in the situation (due to Messrs. Hodgson and\nDavey's work) which led Sir Wm. Crookes to publish his full notes, in order\nthat they might be reconsidered, if necessary, in the light of subsequent know\nledge. But one would at least have expected his critic to take note of his\nemphatic declaration that he finds \"nothing to retract or alter\" and has\n\"discovered no flaw in the experiments then made or in the roasoning based\nupon them.\" (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 98.) Instead of this, Dr. Lehmann\nprefers to judge by his subjective impressions. He unfortunately derived\nfrom Sir Wm. Crookes's first account an 'impression' that the conditions\nin detail had been exactly analogous to those of physical experimentation\n(p. 271).1 He then proceeds to derive from Sir Wm. Crookes's notes another\nimpression that the conditions were very like those of ordinary stances, and,\nbeing impressed with a discrepancy which exists rather in his impressions\nthan in the actual narratives, he summarily declares Sir Wm. Crookes's\nwhole evidence to be unworthy of credence !\nWhat renders his cavils the more surprising is that he himself is un\nwittingly sitting in the same glass house with Sir Wm. Crookes. His own\nreport on the experiments in 'involuntary' whispering by which he proposes\nto explain telepathy is very far from being complete. As Professor Sidgwick\npointed out in the criticism published in these Proceedings (Part XXXI.,\nVol. XII., p. 299) he gives only highly condensed summaries which leave a\ngood deal to be desired in several important respects.\nFortunately, however. Dr. Lehmann makes admissions in the present\nvolume which enable us to fill up the lacuna in his former evidence, and\nseem to me to throw a good deal of light on his explanation of telepathy,\nthough they do not exactly strengthen one's belief in its correctness.\nIn the first place it appears from p. 455 that Dr. Lehmann has observed\nin himself a strong natural tendency towards vocal automatisms which no\ndoubt would go far to render the \"involuntary whispering\" theory plausible\nto his mind.\nAgain we find on p. 457-8 an avowal which throws quite a new light on\nthe short series of experiments which he made in order to test the possibility\nof transferring telepathically visual images, before he adopted the idea (of\nthe 'involuntary' whisper). (Philosophische Studien, XI., 4, p. 473). In\nthese experiments results looking very much like telepathy were produced\nwhen Dr. Lehmann was the percipient, while his colleague Dr. Hansen failed\nentirely. ' Involuntary ' whispering being then taken up, the first type of\nexperiment was abandoned and the evidence remained inconclusive. Dr.\nLehmann indeed regards his success as wholly illusory, but the passage\n(referred to above) in his present volume renders it possible that he is\nwrong. He there tells us that in consequence of his strenuous efforts in\nseances to produce automatic writing2 he got into such a state of excitement\nand neurasthenia that the beard on one side of his face dropped out.\nIt hardly therefore seems too audacious a suggestion that he is himself\n1 It is, to be sure, somewhat strange that Dr. Lehmann should have got sucb an\nimpression, for it appears from various passages that he has attended a large number\nof tiances and is quite familiar with their conditions.\n\u25a0 Why, by the way, has he never published an account of these experiments !\n\f440 F. C. S. Schiller. [Supplement.\nsomething of a 'medium,' or\u2014as his scientific friends would call it\u2014of a\nneuropathic subject, and that, if so, there may really have been a trace of\ntelepathy about the experiments which he did not persist in. (Cf. also\np. 351, where he all but writes himself down a ' medium ').\nIndeed, we might proceed to extend this theory to his later experiments\nand to point out that a little real telepathy would help greatly in the inter\npretation of a faintly heard and quite inarticulate whisper, if only their\ninconclusiveness were not already quite apparent on other grounds.1 Per\nsonally, I feel that so long as a scientific critic of telepathy can satisfy\nhimself with Dr. Lehmann's explanation of Mr. Newnham's experiments,\nviz., by ' unconscious ideas aroused by unnoticed whisperings ' (p. 454)\nwe are still a long way from an explanation of the matter.\nOther admissions which are of interest in view of Dr. Lehmann's general\nposition are found on pp. 338, 351, and 456, that disbelief leads to non-\nobservation, and that even fraudulent mediums need not be wholly fraudu\nlent, but may exhibit genuine automatisms which contribute to their\nsuccess and differentiate them from ordinary conjurors. Indeed, Dr.\nLehmann declares, on the strength of his own experience, that Mr. Davey\nwas probably an excellent ' medium ' !\nOn the other hand, he must by this time feel that he was a little hasty\nin writing on p. 457 that in consequence of the ' exposure ' of Eusapia\nPaladino \"spiritism has ceased to exist as a scientific problem.\"\nAltogether he is not quite fair to the spiritist theory. He tends to\nregard it as intrinsically superstitious and a priori inadmissible (esp.\np. 471-2), in a way in which 'occultism,' i.e., the assumption of unknown\nforces, is not. He is consequently puzzled (p. 314) to understand why both\n' spiritism ' and ' occultism ' have so often been held together. But surely\na moment's reflection would have shown him that if there is room in the\nuniverse for undiscovered forces, ' spirits ' may be among them, while if a\nspirit world interacts with ours, the forces whereby this occurs are prac\ntically unknown. In point of fact, the spiritist hypothesis is intrinsically\nas good as any other, and has certain well-marked advantages, if it is\ntreated in a scientific manner. It must therefore be repeated as often\nas is needful that superstition consists, not in holding any particular theory,\nbut in the way in which it is held.\nIt must be noted, further, that Dr. Lehmann has, curiously enough,\nomitted all account of the modern evidence as to 'haunted houses.'\n1 It seems to me a strange abuse of language to describe the whispering as 'involun\ntary, ' and I do not wonder that when Professor Sidgwick tried to repeat Dr. Lehmann's\nexperiments he could not attain to the ' involuntariness. ' The fact is that Dr.\nLehmann's whisperings, as is practically admitted by Dr. Hansen (loc. cil. p. 603),\nwere quite voluntary and conscious. The agent was perfectly aware of what he\nwas about and could regulate the loudness and distinctness of his whispers to a\nnicety. I am surprised only at the moderation of the experimenters in limiting\nthe percentage of their successes to 33 per cent. They might just as well have\nmade it 100 per cent. ! I suppose they stopped where they did in order to\n'mimic' better the telepathic series of the S.P.R. But the analogy between\nMessrs. Lehmann and Hansen's experiments and bona fide telepathy seems to\nme wholly illusory.\n\fPart xxviii.] Reviews. 441\nOn the other hand, it is surprising that he should have found it worth\nwhile to mention (p. 303), and apparently to credit the stories of the ' buried\nfakir.' For the only case of the sort which is evidentially respectable is, I\nbelieve, that which seemed to occur for Ranjit Singh's benefit, as reported by\nSir Claude Martin Wade. But a slight reflection upon the powers of political\nintrigue in a Hindu court to bring about the apparent result is enough\nto render the story extremely suspect, without casting the slightest doubt\non the good faith either of Sir Claude Wade or Ranjit Singh himself, and\nto bring out the great scientific rashness of crediting the alleged fact on\nsuch evidence. Verily Dr. Lehmann also is sometimes capable of the feat\nof swallowing a camel !\nTypographically there are few errors, except that Messrs. F. W. H. and\nA. T. Myers generally appear as Meyrs. In Miss X.'s case also the real\nname is not Goodrich but Goodrich-Freer. This error is perhaps the more\nworth correcting as it occurs also elsewhere, e.g., in FouilleVs Psycholoyie\ndes Idees-Forces (II., 397, etc.).\nIn conclusion, it is perhaps permissible to express a hope that Dr.\nLehmann may find himself able to continue his experimental investigations\nof subjects whose obscurity has long been a disgrace to science, and that\nwhen he does so, he will recognise how greatly co-operation conduces to success,\nand that not only in the collection of psychological statistics. Hitherto he\nseems to have asked and received little aid from those who have made a\nspecial study of such subjects, but Professor Flournoy's recent success has\nshown that it is quite possible to maintain the sympathetic attitude which\nenlists support, without derogating from the demand for scientific proof.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nPsgchism: Analysis of Things Existing. By Paul Gibieb, M.D. (New\nYork Bulletin Publishing Company. Fifth Edition. No date.)\nDr. Gibier, as he has told us in his title page, is Director of the New York\nPasteur Institute and sometime Assistant Professor of the Museum of\nNatural Philosophy at Paris. He has also conducted various independent\ninvestigations as to bacteriology, and has been entrusted by the French\nGovernment on several occasions with the mission of studying epidemics of\ncholera, yellow fever, etc. When a man with such qualifications under\ntakes the analysis of the Cosmos, his views are certainly entitled to a respectful\nhearing. It is to be regretted, indeed, that in the present book Dr. Gibier\ngives us so few detailed accounts of his own experiences. He has many\nstriking facts to relate, but they are for the most part either borrowed from\nother writers or given in the way of allusion or reference.. Thus he tells us\nthat he has witnessed the phenomenon of \"direct spirit writing\" at least\n500 times (p. 229), but the only instance here quoted occurred in the pre\nsence of the medium, Slade. Dr. Gibier gives an account of this experiment\nwritten by a third person, now dead, but it is not even clear whether he\nhimself was present (p. 211). One very striking series of sittings with an\nAmerican medium, \"Mr. S.,\" who we may fairly presume to have been\nSlade himself, he does, however, describe in some detail. The sittings\n\f442 Frank Podmore. [supplement.\nwere held in a biological laboratory close to a large dissecting room at the\nCollege Rollin, in Paris, in 1886, for the purpose of obtaining casts of\nspirit hands. Some plaster of Paris was placed in a large vessel under a\nwire cage, on which the sitters placed their feet. The conditions apparently\nwere not favourable to the particular form of manifestation : and the\nmedium felt bad influences about. No results of note were observed. At\nthe second seance, also, no casts of hands were obtained, but the investi\ngators were not left without some proofs of spirit agency. As they mounted\nthe stairs in semi-darkness, the medium in advance, a glass jar was thrown\non the stairs by an unseen hand and smashed to pieces, and in the seance\nroom itself the medium was suddenly possessed of a violent and malicious\nspirit, and, seizing a chair, threatened the company with it. Then, to quote\nDr. Gibier's account of the impressive scene (pp. 204-205), \" He advanced\non us [i.e., the author, his friends apparently standing aloof], still swinging\nthe chair, and we were prepared to parry with our stool, when suddenly, we\nknow not by what force, we were prompted to try an experiment, said\nto be infallible in such occurrences, which had been taught us by a man\nfamiliar with these matters. We threw aside the stool which we held and\nadvanced both hands toward the unfortunate entranced one, strongly ' will\ning ' he should become immobilised. We projected, as it were, our will\nagainst him, adding to this cerebral effort an energetical gesture. The effect\nwas instantaneous, and we were the first to be surprised at the happy result :\ninstead of hurling the chair at us it was thrown backward, and, although\nquite a strong one, was broken past the possibility of repair. ' S.' became\nas if struck by lightning, his body was shaken with a convulsive tremor,\nbrusquely carried three or four yards distant from where he stood, and\ndropped on the floor against the wall. All his limbs were contorted, his\njoints cracked, and finally he shrivelled and curled up like a ball.\"\nIt was through such scenes as these that our author was initiated into\nthe secrets of the Cosmos. Briefly, for him, as for Hegel, but with a differ\nence, the factors of the universe are threefold. There is mind, matter, and\nthat which mediates between them\u2014animic or ethereal energy. It is this\nthird constituent which in its most generalised form penetrates as ether the\ninterstellar spaces, which radiates from the operator in hypnotism, which\nforms an aura round the entranced subject, which can be manipulated by\nEastern Yogis and photographed by Parisian savants. In a word, Dr.\nGibier belongs to the school represented in modern France by de Rochas,\nBaraduc, Barety, and the late Dr. Luys ; and farther back by Tardy du\nMontravel, by Mesmer, and by the long tradition of the Alchemists. In\nsearching through his pages for circumstantial evidence of the all-pervading\nfluid, I have found instead an admirable maxim which has already done good\nservice in a similar capacity for students of the Occult in this country :\u2014\n\"There is no religion higher than Truth.\"\nBut Dr. Gibier gives us the means of testing for ourselves the presence\nof the animic fluid. Here is an experiment which we may all try (pp.\n127-8.) \"It is to-day an acquired fact for all those who study the question,\nthat a force, which can very easily be put in evidence, sallies forth and acts\nat a distance according to the wish of the active subject, or operator : or\nstill, when we come to the passive subject this force manifests itself in\n\fPart xxxvni ] Reviews. 443\nthe percipient under the influence of a suggested order ; or again, spon\ntaneously in the medium during a passive, conscious, or unconscious state.\nFor instance, one may with some hypnotisable subjects make the following\nexperiment, which we shall call the experiment of Horace Pelletier,\ninasmuch as it was made for the first time by that experimenter under the\nfollowing conditions :\u2014If one, or better, several, sensitive subjects, having\ntheir hands placed over a jar of water, are ordered (verbal suggestion) to\ncause the liquid to move as if it were boiling without touching it : one\nmay after a relatively short time (it is useless to wait more than half-\nan-hour at each sitting) see the water beginning to ripple at first and then\nmoving as if a small fish were disturbing it by playful evolutions : then it\nbegins to bubble as if it were boiling, so that sometimes it overflows and\npartly runs out of the jar . . . Mr. Pelletier, who has frequently\nwritten to us of this experiment, has not mentioned the fact that the\nsubjects sometimes complain, as soon as the experiment is begun, of a pain in\nthe arms and hands.\"\nWhen our readers have carried out this experiment for themselves to a\nsuccessful conclusion, they will no doubt be prepared to accept Dr. Gibier's\naccount of other manifestations of the animic fluid.\nFrank Podmore.\n[Whilst the foregoing notice was passing through the press, we heard\nwith much regret the news of Dr. Gibier's sudden death through an accident.\nDr. Gibier, though still a young man, had already, as stated, done good\nwork in other branches of scientific inquiry : and it can hardly be doubted\nthat wider knowledge of these problems, and experiences of the numerous\nand subtle sources of error which beset them, would have led a man of his\nabilities and scientific acumen to employ in his psychical inquiries more\nof the critical faculty, and to adopt methods of investigation more in\nharmony with those which he had already employed with conspicuous\nsuccess in other fields.\u2014F.

Yet there were very\nfew Englishmen present, and at the former Congresses members of the\nS.P.R. were much more prominent. But now, as it seemed to me, the work\nand the spirit of the English society met with less resistance and a more\ngeneral acknowledgment and approbation than at any of the three previous\nCongresses.\nThis was not, however, clear at the outset. In the two opening speeches\nby Professor Ribot and Professor Ebbinghaus, describing the development\nof Psychology in the last century and in the last few years, the work of the\nS.P.R. was not particularly insisted upon. Professor Ribot mentioned it,\nshortly but appreciatively ; Professor Ebbinghaus gave it no place among\nthe characteristic features of modern psychology. But if we may regard\nthe members of the Congress as a truly representative body of modern\npsychologists their attitude afforded evidence of a remarkable deviation\nfrom this official standpoint. For if there was anything characteristic in the\ncompany, it was the general interest and more or less acknowledged belief\nin things that some ten or twenty years ago would have been pooh-poohed\nand called unscientific,\u2014supernatural, occult, or mystical.\nIt is true that the lines of psychology are not well marked out ; its\nlimits are unknown, its borders vague and ill-defined. Under the same\nflag of psychology were gathered together the brain-anatomist, the psycho-\nphysiologist, whose laboratory work shows no essential difference from\nthat of the physiologist, the speculative philosopher, the spiritualist, the\nmystic, the Christian priest, the Indian Yogi. We hold it as certain\nthat many members of the Congress did not at all acknowledge the right of\nthe majority of their fellow-members to represent the science of psychology.\nStill, there were celebrated names, important communications, a serious and\ndignified tone. And yet the opposition to subjects of an occult or mystical\ncharacter, if not weak, was certainly not overpowering.\nThe extremes were well balanced and the distribution of subjects at\nthe general meetings was cleverly and impartially arranged. There were\nbrilliant demonstrations of brain-physiology, showing the influence of dif\nferent narcotics and toxicants, and also of passions and emotions, on the\ncellular elements of the cortical matter.1 On the other hand, an eloquent\n1 Dr. Paul Heger and Dr. Jean Demoor (Bruxelles), Contributions a la 1ih;\/>ioloijic\nde la couche cortimlt.\n\f446 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [Supplement.\nvindication of the validity and importance of that most ancient and venerable\ndoctrine of mystical wisdom, the Indian Yoga, was delivered by one of its\ndistinguished followers, T. Ch. Chatterji, of Benares.\nIt was remarked by Professor Ebbinghaus, as a peculiar feature of\nmodern psychology as compared with the psychology of a hundred years\nago, that the old psychology had a religious and mystical tendency, while\nthe modern aimed simply at becoming a science, exactly like any other\nscience.\nBut it is useless to conceal that this does not fully meet with the views\nand the motives of the S.P.R. as a whole. While that Society is extremely\nanxious to proceed along strictly scientific and unbiassed lines, many of its\nmembers seem aware at the same time that (taking religion in its widest\nand deepest sense) science is only part of religion, and can have no beneficial\neffect without a deep moral conviction, embracing and unifying all branches\nof science, thus giving them their worth and true meaning.\nFrom this point of view Psychology is the tenderest and most vital\norgan of modern science, for in it lies the link between the science of\nexact observation and speculative and mystical thought. In fact, psycho-\nphysiology, which consists in comparative measurements of sense-impressions\nand the founding thereon of general laws, \u2014and speculative thought, which\ntries to express verbally the most profound factors of our being, are\nseparated by an immense gulf, and can hardly be brought under one com\nmon name. The former belongs simply to the great edifice of natural\nsciences, as a subordinate part, the latter being at the same time the\nfoundation and corner-stone of the whole building.\nBut the two were conjoined here under the name Psychology, and it\nseems as if the natural relation between science and religion can only be\nrestored in this domain.\nReaders of the proceedings of the Congress will easily see what a large\npart of the communications consisted of what I may call the material of\npsychical research. From every part of the world observations were forth\ncoming about mediumship, trance, thought-reading, and the like. And what\nreaders will hardly deduce from the printed reports is the still larger part\nthat these matters played in private conversation. Rumours about facts\nshowing evidence of remarkable faculties were rife, and it is not unlikely\nthat we shall hear ere long of communications, from a German source, which\nwill startle many disbelievers. Only caution and the fear of shaking the\nwell-earned German reputation for thoroughness has thus far withheld\nthem.\nAnd even among the staunchest rationalists, the most rigid believers in\nexact science without any mystical basis, there was a milder attitude and a\ngreater interest in the subject than I had ever observed before. In the\nsmile wherewith they asked, \"Now, do tell me, what did principally con\nvince you 1 \" there was something of a glimmer of allowing that to be\nconvinced could not be so very bad after all. No doubt the psychological\nrule of the crowd,\u2014which alleges that no individual can keep free from the\nmental influence of a majority, \u2014was again confirmed here.\nAnother remarkable fact was the foundation of the Instttnt Psychique, or\nPaychologique. There was, of course, the inevitable quarrel about the right\n\fPart xxxviii.I Fourth Congress of Psychology. 447\nname, this time not without some significance. We may have our doubts\nand fears as to the success of this undertaking of M. Yourievitch ; but we\ncannot doubt that it is meant to be a great international development of the\nwork of the S.P.R.\nOur President, Mr. F. W. H. Myers, when he took the chair in June,\nstated that his election was remarkable because it meant the acknowledg\nment of psychical study as a regular science, as he had no other scientific\ntitle but that of a psychical researcher. Both this last Congress and the\nInstitut Psychique seem to afford weighty corroborations of his statement.\nPeople who devote their lives solely to the most difficult investigations of\npsychical phenomena are no longer considered for that reason cranks, or\nscientific outlaws, who may fill volumes of periodicals and hold crowded\nmeetings without the slightest notice being taken by official science. Not\nonly did these persons form a large part of the Congress, which was under\nthe leadership of the most celebrated scientists, but there seems to be a\nchance now that they may soon possess something like an Academy or\nClasses which will form that official standard which is at present more\nlacking, although more requisite, in this particular branch of science than\nin any other.\nFor it cannot be denied that the neglect of the subject by academic\nscience has led to a wild and profuse growth of pseudo-science, with reckless\ntheories and worthless observations. So there is great need of sifting and\npruning, of the formation of a high and consistent standard of evidence,\nwhich may be done by co-operation throughout the whole world.

We must learn to submit to hearing our own\nachievements exaggerated, \u2014and at the same time mixed up with narratives\nand opinions for which we have no intention whatever of making ourselves\nresponsible.

[part\nIN MEMORY OF HENRY SIDGWICK.\nBy F. W. H. Myees.\n\"From Maximus I learnt self-government, and not to be led aside\nby anything ; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in\nillness ; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and\ndignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. I\nobserved that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that\nin all that he did he never had any bad intention ; and he never showed\namazement and surprise, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation,\nnor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was\naccustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was\nfree from all falsehood ; and he presented the appearance of a man who\ncould not be diverted from right rather than of a man who had been\nimproved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he was\ndespised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man.\"\nThese simple sentences, in which the Stoic Emperor describes his\nhonoured teacher, must recall to all of us, with striking appropriate\nness, the friend and leader whom we shall see on earth no more. There\nare others better qualified than I to retrace and estimate his manifold\nactivities in the world of beneficent action and of lofty thought. I\nshall speak of him only in two capacities ;\u2014as the closest and most\nrevered of friends, and as our captain in the great enterprise which it-\nis the object of this Society to pursue.\nYet as I speak I shall feel the perpetual need of his sanction for\nwhat I say ; and this utterance of mine\u2014the first which will have\nlacked his helpful criticism\u2014must needs be of all utterances that\nwhich needs his help the most. No one but himself could truly depict\nthe progress of that subtle and all-embracing intelligence, and my\nsketch will be but a blurred projection, where the master's thought is\ndimmed and deflected by passing through the disciple's mind.\nIt is just forty years since I went up to Trinity College, Cambridge,\nas a freshman of seventeen, and began to read with Henry Sidgwick as\nmy private tutor in classics. But he soon ceased to take private pupils,\nand spread his own studies over a wider range. Even then he was, to\nuse George Sand's phrase, tourmente' des choses divines, and he sought\nwhether the study of Oriental languages, of ancient philosophies, of\nhistory, of science, would throw light upon that traditional Revelation\nwhich hung before him with so much of attractiveness in its promises.\n\fXXXIX ] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 453\nso much of uncertainty in its origin and its foundation. The theo\nretical result of these studies was not unusual ; the practical outcome\nwas academically almost unique. Theoretically he concluded that the\nChristian tradition\u2014so long, at least, as it remains unsupported by\ncognate evidence\u2014is not strong enough to upbear the orthodox creed\nas to the existence and the relation to mankind of a spiritual world.\nPractically he determined that, as he was no longer \"a bond-fide member\nof the Church of England,\" he would resign his Trinity Fellowship,\nwhich was held upon that condition.\nIt may illustrate the bluntness of moral perception which such tests\nengender, if I add that\u2014even while myself aggressively orthodox\u2014I\nnevertheless considered that the vague phrase of the Declaration,\u2014\nwhich had been substituted for a definite subscription to the Articles\u2014\npermitted the retention of a Fellowship by any man who had been born\ninto the Church of England, and had not taken any overt step to re\nnounce his allegiance. Sidgwick's action, however, caused no surprise ;\nhe was already a man (as George Eliot later said of him), whose\nfriends tacitly expected him to conform to moral standards higher than\nthey themselves cared to maintain. His resignation, as is well known,\nbrought others with it ; it attracted the attention of Parliament, and\nexercised some real influence in procuring the abolition of University\nTests.\nIn single-hearted devotion to the Right and Reasonable there was\nno period of life in which Henry Sidgwick had much to learn. But I\nshall not conceal,\u2014what is indeed to his credit,\u2014that in some other\ndirections his ultimate character was largely of his own making. I\ncannot claim for him that he was by nature one of those men\noo-oit hibaKTov nijSc'v,\u2014who, like his friend Charles Bowen, seem born\nto attract every love and to win every victory. Those who knew\nSidgwick only in later life, when sympathy, benignity, the very\nripeness and mellowness of wisdom, seemed his predominant traits,\nwould be surprised to know of the coldness with which he was regarded\nby many contemporaries and juniors in his early student days. \"High,\nself-contain'd, and passionless,\" like the mystic Arthur,\u2014he almost\nseemed, as he himself wrote to me later, to be \"cased in a bark of\nselfish habit,\" and to fulfil all righteousness with a jejune precision,\n\u2014almost as anxious not to accord too much to his neighbours as not\nto accord too little. There was a reserve, a preoccupation, perhaps\nalso a proud sensitiveness, which chilled and checked in him the\nnatural lavishness and abandon, of youth. But he became, as I\nhave said, the faber indolis sum ;\u2014by sheer meditation, by high\nresolve, he made himself such as we all know him ;\u2014so that \" no\nman could ever imagine either that he was despised by Maximus,\nor that he was himself a better man.\"\n\f454 F. W. H. Myers. [pabt\nYet partly also I ought to say of that earlier stage of his character\nthat it was \/ who \" half despis'd the height, To which I would not or I\ncould not climb,\" and that on his part the treasure was not proffered\ntill it was needed ;\u2014that his lesson of wise suspense and high resolve\nwas taught to those only who had found the world's facile pleasures\nempty, and its confident solutions vain.\nMy own entry into his intimacy, at any rate, was in an hour of\ndeep inward need.\n\" Faith at her zenith, or all but lost in the gloom of doubts that darken\nthe schools\" :\u2014\nI had passed through all these stages, and visiting Cambridge again in\n1869 to examine for the Moral Sciences Tripos, I felt drawn in my per\nplexities to Henry Sidgwick as somehow my only hope. In a star-light\nwalk which I shall not forget (December 3rd, 1869), I asked him, almost\nwith trembling, whether he thought that when Tradition, Intuition,\nMetaphysic, had failed to solve the riddle of the Universe, there was still\na chance that from any actual observable phenomena,\u2014ghosts, spirits,\nwhatsoever there might be,\u2014some valid knowledge might be drawn as\nto a World Unseen. Already, it seemed, he had thought that this was\npossible ; steadily, though in no sanguine fashion, he indicated some\nlast grounds of hope ; and from that night onwards I resolved to\npursue this quest, if it might be, at his side. Even thus a wanderer\nin the desert, abandoning in despair the fair mirages which he has\nfollowed far in vain, might turn and help an older explorer in the poor\nsearch for scanty roots and muddy water-holes.\nThis was, I fear, but a slow and late conversion to the sense, which\nso many men had already reached, of Sidgwick's penetrating wisdom.\nWhen I think of other Trinity men whom I have found worthy of\nrespect, from rather before my own date to rather after it,\u2014of\nMontagu Butler, R. C. Jebb, G. O. Trevelyan, Henry Jackson,\u2014of\nBalfours, Lytteltons, Darwins,\u2014of W K. Clifford, Lord Rayleigh,\nF. W. Maitland, Walter Leaf, Henry Butcher, Edmund Gurney, and\nthe rest ;\u2014it seems to me as though all these had been prompter than\nI to appreciate that which in the end I knew so well. Nay, but in the\nend, perhaps, of all these, only Arthur Balfour and Edmund Gurney\nfell into quite the same attitude towards Sidgwick as myself :\u2014the\nattitude as of \" companions of Socrates \" :\u2014as it were, say, a Kritias of\nhappier omen, a Theages, a Simmias,\u2014feeling an essential stimulus to\nself-development in his intellectual search, his analysing elenchus ;\u2014\nand feeling also in the steadfastness of his inward aspiration a\nprophylactic, as each man might need it, against dilettantism, or self-\nindulgence, or despair.\nHow strong may be that craving for Wisdom, when once Wisdom\nhas seemed to speak with us in the voice of a man ! \" Beauty,\" says\n\fxxxix.] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 455\nPlato, \" we love best, because we see her clearest ; Wisdom with\nbodily eyes we cannot see, or terrible had been the loves she had\ninspired.\"\nIn that colloquy of which I have spoken above, Sidgwick and I had\ncaught together the distant hope that Science might in our age make\nsufficient progress to open the spiritual gateway which she had been\nthought to close ;\u2014to penetrate by her own slow patience into the\nvestibule of an Unseen World.\n\"I sometimes feel,\" he wrote to me in 1872, \" with somewhat of a\nprofound hope and enthusiasm, that the function of the English mind,\nwith its uncompromising matter-of-factness, will be to put the final\nquestion to the Universe with a solid passionate determination to be\nanswered which must come to something.\"\nYet the mode of putting this idea into practice was hard to find.\nWe were forced in the beginning to follow pathways trampled for the\nmost part by quite other than scientific feet. Our efforts of the first\nfew years (1872-6) were tiresome and distasteful enough ;\u2014yet what\nwere they in comparison to the hardship which a naturalist will undergo\nto trace (say) the breeding-ground of a song-bird, or to establish the\nrelationships of a worm of the sea ? The efforts would have been as\nnothing had the results been clear. But the results of those years\nwere on either side unsatisfactory ;\u2014so contradictory, so perplexing,\nthat we could neither feel sure that there was nothing discoverable,\nnor yet that any valid discovery had in fact been made. For some\nyears, indeed (1876-1881), we worked but fitfully, \u2014half-sickened at\n\" Craft, with a bunch of all-heal in her hand, follow'd up by her vassal\nlegion of fools.\" Yet even those years were not lost. Driven perforce\nto question ourselves closely as to the validity of the principles from\nwhich we had started, we found no reason to desert them. Assuredly,\nif a spiritual world has ever been manifested to man,\u2014has ever been\nintermingled with this material scheme of things,\u2014it must be manifest,\nmust be intermingled now. The failure of such an inquiry as ours ;\u2014\nI mean the ultimate relinquishment of every effort in this one direction\nof real possibility of advance ;\u2014must needs prove, if not a death\nblow, yet a dire discouragement to every sacred memory, to all\nspiritual hope. It would be hard for future men to persuade them\nselves that what in ages of knowledge and clarity was seen to be fraud\nand illusion had yet been verity and revelation in the confused\nobscurity of the Past.\nAnd thus it was to men wearied but not broken, discouraged but\nnot despairing, that at the end of 1881 a fresh call to exertion came.\nAn attempt was to be made, under somewhat better auspices than other\nsuch attempts which had failed before, to confront spiritualistic and\nsimilar beliefs with scientific inquiry. Professor Barrett represented\n\f45G F. W. H. Myers. [part\nthe scientific, Stainton Moses the spiritualistic camp. One of the\nfirst questions, of course, was whether Sidgwick would join in the\nproposed Society. Edmund Gurney and I made our adhesion contin\ngent on his acceptance of the Presidency ;\u2014but reported to him that\nthere seemed indeed to be a chance here of uniting new inquirers, and\nof pushing promising experiments.\nHe took time to consider his reply ;\u2014a reply on which the employ\nment of much of the energy of his remaining eighteen years of life in\nfact depended. It would have been impossible to press him to consent.\nAdmit that we had been right in making our laborious attempt ;\u2014nay,\nthat it was still right to keep a watchful eye on any possible opening\nfor inquiry. Yet he had done all that utmost fairness could require.\nOught a man who in so many other ways could definitely advance\nhuman knowledge and human happiness to turn aside and commit\nhimself anew\u2014and more deeply than ever\u2014to the gratuitous quixotism\nof endeavouring to benefit the race in this difficult and uncalled-for\nway ?\u2014to get the moon for a child who had not even cried for it f\n\"To the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness.\"\nWho really wanted the new knowledge, even if we could manage to\ngive it them ? Men satisfied with an existing revelation did not desire\nto have that revelation extended. They no more wished to have their\nunique tradition enrolled and justified in a cosmic order than those old\nwarriors wished to have the eclipse which routed their foemen reduced\nunder astronomical law. And as for the \" Greeks,\"\u2014the men of\nscience to whom we desired to link ourselves,\u2014from them there was\nlittle sign as yet of anything but compassion or scorn.\nOn the other side was the fact that, however unsatisfactory our\nquest might have thus far proved, there yet had never been (as Sidg\nwick himself had said) \" any given moment at which we felt that we\nhad a right to abandon it.\" Its problems were still absolutely\nunsettled ; and it was still possible that at any moment light might\ncome. And the original thesis still stood firm\u2014namely, that whether\nor no it be possible by observation and experiment,\u2014along the paths\nof science patiently pursued,\u2014to raise the human race into ethical\nstability,\u2014the Cosmos into intelligible coherence ;\u2014at any rate these\nresults are certainly not attainable in any other way. Without fresh\nfacts none of us can get any further. There are simply not enough\nknown determinants for any valid solution. What use in fondling\nhallowed traditions, or in juggling with metaphysical terminology?\nUnless the human race can find more facts, it may give up the problem\nof the Moral Universe altogether.\nSidgwick consented to become the first President of the Society for\nPsychical Research ; and on July 17th, 1882, delivered an Inaugural\nAddress (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. I., page 78) which in its freedom\n\fXXXIX.] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 457\nalike from pretentiousness and from contentiousness set a precedent\nfrom which he never departed.\nOf what essential value his services were to the new body has been\nwell shown in a letter recently sent by Mr. Podmore to the Daily\nChronicle :\u2014\nFor the first few years of its existence (except for an interval, during which\nhe stepped aside in favour of the late Professor Balfour Stewart) Mr.\nSidgwick acted as president of the Society. But the bare statement of that\nfact conveys a very inadequate idea of the real nature of the services\nrendered by him. That he gave largely\u2014very largely\u2014of his personal\nmeans to help the work of investigation in those earlier years is the least of\nhis benefits. He presided throughout at our councils ; he took an active\nshare in the tedious work of experiment, of examining witnesses, of\ncollecting and appraising evidence ; the Unes on which our work could best\nbe done were laid down by his advice and pursued under his personal\ndirection ; all the publications of the Society were issued under his immediate\nsupervision. That of late years he has delegated to others many of these\nfunctions was due less to any decay of his personal interest in the work of\ninvestigation than to the feeling that his immediate supervision of all details\nwas no longer neceasary. But he has throughout these eighteen years been\na regular attendant at our meetings, and has taken a constant and predominant\npart in all our deliberations. Whatever position the S.P.R. may hold to-day,\nwhatever good work it may have done in exposing error or in directing\nattention to neglected facts in human psychology, its success is due, in the\nlargest measure, to the wisdom, the clear insight, the ' ' particularly sane\nintellect \" (to quote the words of your memoir), and, above all, to the pre\neminent justice and veracity of our first president.\nNo other man, I think, could have filled that post so well as he.\nWe had before us no straightforward scientific task, such as could be\nplanned once for all, and then parcelled out to committees for execution.\nWhat was needed was a wide and scattered inquisition into human\nfaculty and human experience ; an inquisition which could not rely\nonly on familiar canons of evidence, but needed the establishment of\nmany new criteria, consistent with each other and with the old. There\nwas work for many specialists, but at the head of all there was\nmanifest need of a philosopher in the widest sense ;\u2014of a man\naccustomed, like the author of the Methods of Ethics and the Principles\nof Political Economy, to weigh conflicting opinions, to comprehend\nand meet the perplexities of varying minds.\nMoral qualities were needed, too ;\u2014patience, and caution, and\nurbanity ;\u2014and above all a certain doggedness and fixity of resolve,\nwhich should pursue its course unbaffled by long delays, by mortifying\ndefeat. And Sidgwick possessed, in an almost unique degree, that\nmotive for dogged persistence which lay in a deep sense of the incurable\nincoherence of the intelligible world, as thus far grasped by men.\n\f458 F. W. H. Myers. [part\nMore thoroughly than any other man known to me he had exhausted\none after another the traditional creeds, the accredited speculations ;\u2014\nhad followed out even to their effacement in the jungle the advertised\npathways to truth. Long years of pondering had begotten in him a\nmood of mind alike rare and precious ;\u2014a scepticism profound and far-\nreaching, which yet had never curdled into indifference nor frozen into\ndespair.\nHis controversial urbanity, indeed, never quite concealed the\nclearness and even the sternness of his perception of the fallacies\nwhich both Christian apologetics and a priori metaphysics too often\nhide at their heart. 1 And thus, while renewing this toilsome quest in\nno sanguine spirit, he renewed it at least with the conviction that there\nwas nothing else of equal moment to be done ; that if, where religion\nand philosophy had failed in establishing certainty, Science were to fail\nalso, \"the human race,\" as he once said to me, \"had better henceforth\nthink about these matters \" (the basis of morals, the government of the\nuniverse) \" as little as they possibly can.\"\nI shall not here attempt to define the various conclusions\u2014or \/ion-\nconclusions\u2014at which this cautious thinker arrived in the course of\nhis long research. I will quote only a few sentences,\u2014for him of\nunusual definiteness,\u2014to which he signed his name, at the close of that\nlaborious statistical inquiry into hallucinations over which he presided,\nand which fills the tenth volume of our Proceedings (Vol. X., p. 394).\n\" Between deaths and apparitions of the dying person a connection\nexists which is not due to chance alone. This we hold as a proved fact.\nThe discussion of its full implications cannot be attempted in this\npaper;\u2014-nor, perhaps, exhausted in this age.\"\nNow, it is true indeed, as those last words hint, that the scientific\nmind of the actual generation is scarcely prepared to use in any fruitful\nmanner\u2014or even to realise with full clearness\u2014a discovery so far\nremote from that synthesis of knowledge on which human thought is at\npresent mainly engaged. The fact alleged has few existing connections ;\nit remains, so to say, on the mere surface of the hearer's mind. Yet of\ncourse no savant, no philosopher, can deny that that one fact, if true,\nconstitutes an inlet into cosmic laws of an absolutely new kind ;\u2014\nsuggests operations and an environment of which we have hitherto\npossessed no positive knowledge whatever. It forms a first step towards\nexactly what we are aiming at,\u2014namely, the discovery by scientific\nmethods of a spiritual world. It is a fact whose bare existence must\nnegative much previous theorising and suspend much more ;\u2014must\n1 Thoroughly Socratic was his appeal for instruction to a fellow-examiner, when\nrevising the papers of some ultra-Hegelian young man : \" I can see that this is\nnonsense ; but is it the right sort of nonsense ?

The attraction of straws to amber was in\nlike manner for many years a phenomenon too remote from existing\nknowledge to sink deep even into the most eager minds : yet that\nunexplained physical attraction then, like this unexplained spiritual\nattraction now, was probably the phenomenon of greatest pregnancy\noffered to the observation of men.\nThus far, perhaps, but hardly farther, may one here insist on the\nimportance of the psychical work accomplished by one who always\ninsisted that such accomplishment was scarcely to be looked for yet ;\nthat we pioneers ought to be well content if we could prepare the\nscientific mind of the opening century for a forward step such as has\nnever been dreamt of till now ;\u2014prepare the unborn workers, in every\nrealm of philosophy and religion,\nTo cast the kingdoms old\nInto another mould.\nIt has been said of Sidgwick that \"although he was the most\ninfluential man in Cambridge, he founded no school.\" Not at Cam\nbridge only, but over all the civilised world, I think that there are\nmany of us who will say that he did found a school, and that we are\nhis scholars. He did not indeed bequeath to us his wisdom in the\nshape of crisp metaphysical bank-notes, which the Universe would\nultimately decline to cash. Nor did he, like the old man in the fable,\ntell us to dig everywhere for a treasure which in reality was only\nto consist in the strengthening of our own minds. Nay, he pointed to\na definite spot ; he vigorously drove in the spade ; he upturned a\nshining handful, and he left us as his testament, Dig here.\nWe can claim no monopoly in his spiritual benefactions ;\u2014but\nso far as in us lies we can resolve to carry on our work in his spirit.\nTo do this, we must remember that our very raison d'etre is the\nextension of scientific method, of intellectual virtues,\u2014 of curiosity,\ncandour, care,\u2014into regions where many a current of old tradition,\nof heated emotion, even of pseudo-scientific prejudice, deflects the bark\nwhich should steer only towards the cold, unreachable pole of absolute\ntruth. We must recognise that we have more in common with those\nwho may criticise or attack our work with competent diligence than\nwith those who may acclaim and exaggerate it without adding thereto\nany careful work of their own. We must experiment unweariedly ;\nwe must continue to demolish fiction as well as to accumulate truth ;\nwe must make no terms with any hollow mysticism, any half-conscious\n\f460 F. W. H. Myers. [part\ndeceit. If we act thus, we need fear nothing for our adventure. The\nhumblest scouts who strive loyally to push forward the frontier of\nScience, even though Science at first disown them, are sure in time\nto hear her marching legions possess the unfrequented way.\nYet one thing more. To conform to scientific rule and procedure\nis a task within the power of diligent men. We must not leave that\nundone ;\u2014but if we would follow in our first President's steps, there\nis something harder than that which we must do. Sidgwick was not\nonly cautious, systematic, self-controlled, he was also unresting, un-\ndeviating, inwardly ardent to the end ;\u2014possessed, as Plato has it,\nwith that \" iron sense of truth and right \" which makes the least\nindication of intellectual as well as of moral duty fall on the heart\nas an intimate and urgent command :\u2014nay, which bids a man place\nhope and joy in those things only, \"by dwelling on which it is\"\u2014\nas Plato again tells us\u2014\" that even God is divine.\"\nIn ardour, I say, rather than in circumspection, in force of will\nrather than in pondering hesitancy, lay the true core of Sidgwick's\nlife. Even his affections\u2014at first somewhat narrowly bestowed, some\nwhat sternly ordered\u2014widened and deepened, until the emotional\nnature became as rich and strong as the intellectual. Many there are\nwho know that they gave him of their best, and that he gave of his\nbest to them ;\u2014not a few, for whom the Cambridge gardens and\navenues will seem still charged with a sacred intimacy, and haunted\nby a quiet voice, and fragrant with memories of some help or guidance\nof long ago ;\u2014the reason's slowly-broadening outlook, the heart's slow-\nstablished calm.\n\" From kindly act to kindly act,\" he passed, like Marcus Aurelius,\n\" with memory of God.\" Yet even the calmest existence, if sympathies\nbe strong, must come at times within the wind of some tempest which\nhas swept over other lives. I have watched him play his part in a\ngreat tragedy ; I have seen with what delicate comprehension, with\nwhat inexhaustible tenderness, he could come to the succour of some\ninnocent, long-suffering soul. I have seen him also in the joy of his\nown complete and fitting guerdon ; a bliss which came to him through\nthe affections, and was founded upon the deep community of upward-\nstriving souls. We who most revered Henry Sidgwick desired for him\nno earthly honours. Those are but trivial ornaments for the life of\nsuch a man. We knew that the Primal Life has so woven our lesser\nlives into one shining fabric,\u2014has interlinked our human hearts in the\nunity of so strange a joy,\u2014that, when once through some predestined\nencounter the spirit's kinships have been stablished for ever, there is\nno need for further questioning as to the recognition or recompense of\neven the best and wisest soul. Already in this life of earth heaven'\nprizes are bestowed with lavish hand ; there is no man's achievement\n\fxxxix.] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 461\nof wisdom or virtue which one woman's ' reverence cannot amply\nrecognise, one love extravagantly repay.\nAnd still through all personal joy or sorrow, loneliness or com\npanionship, there lived on in this man's heart that impersonal ardour,\nthat cosmic passion, which from suppression takes a whiter glow, and\nburns in the penetralia of the spirit, a silent inextinguishable flame. I\nhave said above that our life's bark should be steered ever towards the\nicy pole of absolute truth. But there is a more living, a truer metaphor.\nMy most vivid memory of my friend is as he would recite to me\u2014and\nI have never known man or woman who could recite poetry like him\u2014\nthat noble apologue of Seekers which was the central expression of his\ninward life. I speak of Tennyson's poem of \" The Voyage,\" that\nallegory of the lifelong quest of an Ideal,\u2014through all its semblances\nthe same unknown Reality,\u2014whose pursuit is more entrancing and\nmore imperious than any earthly joy.\nFor one fair Vision ever fled\nDown the waste waters day and night,\nAnd still we follow'd where she led,\nIn hope to gain upon her flight.\nHer face was evermore unseen.\nAnd fixt upon the far sea-line ;\nBut each man murmur'd, \" O my Queen,\nI follow till I make thee mine.\"\nAnd now we lost her, now she gleam'd\nLike Fancy made of golden air,\nNow nearer to the prow she seem'd\nLike Virtue firm, like Knowledge fair,\nNow high on waves that idly burst,\nLike Heavenly Hope she crown'd the sea,\nAnd now, the bloodless point reversed,\nShe bore the blade of Liberty.\nNay, and the last stanza also spoke his indomitable resolve ;\u2014and\nnot the less characteristically for the touch of self mockery with which\nthe poet ends the song :\u2014\nAgain to colder climes we came,\nFor still we follow'd where she led :\nNow mate is blind and captain lame,\nAnd half the crew are sick or dead,\nBut blind or lame or sick or sound,\nWe follow that which flies before :\nWe know the merry world is round,\nAnd we may sail for evermore.\nTo these hidden fervours Fate vouchsafed few occasions of outward\nenterprise, of manifest heroism.

Others will be\nimpressed with his liberality, his public spirit, his keen interest in\neducation, his brilliancy as a man of letters ; I will speak of his\nscientific side alone. For clear-, cautious intellect and for consummate\nhonesty I have not known his superior. Physicists will understand\nwhat I mean if I say that for critical judgment and supreme candour\nhe stands in my mind on a level with Lord Rayleigh.\nThe word honesty or candour sounds weak and commonplace in\nthis connection, and in its ordinary acceptation so it is ; but there are\ndegrees of candour even among honest and candid men, and in Henry\nSidgwick's case the commonplace aspect of the virtue dropped off and\nsomething of singular dignity shone forth. Those who knew him best\nmay best realise what I mean, may remember instances of his analysis\nof a situation\u2014his comprehension of an opponent's attitude ; but even\ncomparative strangers must have been struck with it, for it was a part\nof his world-wide reputation. Others might be accused of letting\ntheir intelligence be governed by their emotions, their judgment be\noverpowered by their hopes, their scientific acumen be cloaked by their\nambition to be of service, their caution be melted by their enthusiasm :\n\u2014and the accusation might have some grain of truth, why not ? I\nhave accused myself of such momentary lapses before now.\nBut such criticism of Henry Sidgwick was never so much as hinted\nat : no one, however hostile to our inquiry, ever imagined that Sidgwick\nlet his enthusiasm warp his judgment or his candour be coloured by\nhis hopes. Other faults had to be invented for him : over-coolnessi\nhyper-caution, excessive hesitation, exaggerations of his great virtue,\nwe have heard attributed to him ;\u2014yea, I myself have occasionally\nfelt a momentary impatience because even on level ground or on an\n\f464 Dr. Oliver Lodge.\nupward slope he would keep a tight rein ; but the impatience was\nmomentary ; and ample justification of the precaution was soon per\nceived in some dangerous dip close ahead.\nAnd of what vital moment to our cause this reputation, this\nattribute, of his has been ! To it, more perhaps than to any other\nsingle influence, is the comparative success of our movement due. Our\nresearches are hardly yet recognised by official science, it is true, but\nthey are far nearer recognition than ever before\u2014far nearer than they\nwere twenty years ago.\nAnd this recognition is important, for in no other way can their\ncontinuance be ensured independently of the lives of individuals.\nIndividual men of genius in the past have now and again proceeded as\nfar as we have in actual experience ; but their influence has practically\nended with their lives ; and the world, momentarily awakened, has\nlapsed once more into psychical dark ages.\nSo it may be again, but so I hope that again it will not be. I\ntrust that now, at the end of a century of science, a new science has\nbeen born, and has not been still-born. If it should live, and should\nbe nurtured by the goodwill and the labour of generations of critical\nand painstaking workers, that result will have been rendered possible\nnot solely by the manifold powers and energies of Edmund Gurney\nand, of some still living, but by those powers and energies guided\nand curbed and directed by the serene sovereign wisdom of Henry\nSidgwick.\n\f\u00a9bituar\\i.\nFREDERIC W.

[part\nTHE DEVELOPMENT AND GENEALOGY OF THE MISSES\nBEAUCHAMP :\nA Preliminary Report of a Case of Multiple Personality.1\nBy Morton Prince, M.D.\nPhysician fur Nervous Diseases, Boston City Hospital, Boston,\nMassachusetts.\nWhat I propose to tell in this paper is the way in which the\ndifferent personalities of Miss Beauchamp became developed, and the\nrelation which they bear to each other and the true self.\nFrom a great mass of phenomena manifested by this case2 (aboulia,\nnegative hallucination, crystal visions, co-existent conscious states,\nautomatic writing, etc., etc.) I have selected these two points as being,\nit seems to me, the most important involved in its psychology.3\nMiss Beauchamp is a person with several personalities. She has at\nleast three, besides three hypnotic states, and during the past two or\nthree years these three persons have been coming and going apparently\nwithout any law or order. First one and then the other has been\nbobbing in and bobbing out, while each one of them claims to be tbe\nreal Miss Beauchamp, and to have the sole right to existence to the\nexclusion of the others. Each has objected to the habits and doings of\nthe others and to their being allowed to stay and to any consideration\nbeing shown them. It has not been easy to determine which of two\npersonalities at least, if either, is the real self. Cases of multiple\npersonality are not very uncommon, but, so far as I know, no attempt\nhas been made to determine the relation which the different\npersonalities bear to each other. They have been regarded as more or\nless isolated phenomena, each personality described with its own\n1 Read at the International Congress of Psycho'ogy, Paris, August, 1900, under\nthe title of The Problem of Multiple Personalities.\n2 For a briefer account of some of the features of this case, see Dr. Morton\nPrince's \"Experimental Study of Visions,\" by F. W. H. Myers, Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. XIV., pp. 366 et seq.\u2014ED.\n3 I hope soon to publish a complete and extended account of the case in all its\naspects. I regret that the necessary limitations of time will allow only a superficial\ntreatment here.\n\fXL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 467\npeculiarities, and the whole as representing a succession of psychical\nevents.\nThis case has been the subject of a continuous study for at least\nthree years, and has occupied hundreds of hours of time. Now, as the\nend of this study comes, to me at least it seems simple, and it is\ndifficult now to realise the complications that presented themselves\nduring this long period of time, when there seemed to be no relation\nbetween the one thing and the other ; but the difficulties have been\nvery great.\nI have had from time to time a number of theories regarding the\ncase. These have been mere working hypotheses, which I have had to\ngive up one after another ; starting with one, it has fulfilled its part\nfor a while, and then I have had to give it up, finding it completely\ninadequate, until continued study has given what I believe to be the\nreal solution.\nWhen Miss Beauchamp first came under observation she was a\nneurasthenic of a very severe type. She was a student in one of our\ncolleges, and there received a very good education. But in consequence\nof her neurasthenic condition it was simply impossible for her to go on\nwith her work. She was a wreck, I might say, in body. In tempera\nment she is a person of extreme idealism, with a very morbid New\nEngland conscientiousness, and a great deal of pride and reserve, so\nthat she is very unwilling to expose herself or her life to anybody's\nscrutiny. This has been one great difficulty in the study of her case.\nTo this I would add that she is a person of absolute honesty of thought\nand speech. I feel sure we can rely upon and trust her absolutely and\ncompletely. I have never known her, nor has any one, I believe, known\nher,\u2014as herself, or the person whom we call herself, \u2014in any way\nto indulge in any deception. Nevertheless, every safeguard has been\nemployed to guarantee the bond fide character of the phenomena.\nNow she came to see me in this neurasthenic state, but I found\ntreatment was of almost no use. The usual methods were employed\nwith no result, and it seemed as if her case was hopeless. Finally\nI concluded to try hypnotic suggestions. She proved a very good\nsubject, and the suggestions produced at the time rather brilliant\nresults. In hypnosis she went easily into the somnambulistic state.\nThis somnambulistic state came later to be known as B. II., while the\nfirst personality with whom I became acquainted, Miss Beauchamp\nherself, was known as B. I. Now I used to notice that as B. II. she\nwas continually rubbing her eyes ; her hands were in constant motion,\nalways trying to get at her eyes. Still I paid very little attention to\nit, or placed very little significance in this fact, merely attributing it\nto nervousness. One day when I hypnotised her and referred to\nsomething that she had done in a previous hypnotic state,\u2014that is to\n2 k 2\n\f468 Dr. Morion Prince. [part\nsay, something that she had said or done in a previous state when\nI supposed she was B. II., \u2014she denied all knowledge of it and said it\nwas not so. This surprised me, and I attributed the denial at first to\nan attempt at deception. I waked her up and put her to sleep again,\nand this time she admitted what she had previously denied. This\nrather puzzled me, and I made various tests to determine her hones^v\nin the matter. The next time I hypnotised her she denied what she\nhad previously admitted, and so it went on, denying and then\nadmitting, until it dawned upon me that I was dealing with an\nentirely different personality, and this proved to be the case. It\nturned out that when she went into the state of which she later denied\nthe facts, she was an entirely distinct and separate person. This third\npersonality, which then developed, came to be known as B. III. We\nhad then three mental states, B. I., B. II., and B. III.\nB. I. knew nothing of the others. B. II. knew B. I., but no more.\nB. III. knew both B. I. and B. II. Thus far there was nothing very\nunusual.\nNow B. III. has proved to be one of the most interesting of all\nthe personalities that have developed in the case. In one respect it is\none of the most remarkable personalities, I think, that has ever been\nexhibited in any of these cases of multiple personality, as will, I think,\npresently appear. B. III., like B. II., was constantly rubbing her\neyes, so that I was frequently compelled to hold her hands by force to\nprevent her from doing so. When asked why she did this, she said\nshe wished to get her eyes opened, and it turned out afterwards that it\nwas she who was rubbing the eyes of B. II. in the earlier times. At\nthis time I prevented B. III. from opening her eyes for the reason that\nI feared that, if she got her eyes opened and was thereby able to add\nthe visual images of her surroundings to her mental life as B. III.,\nthese same images of her surroundings which she would also have, of\ncourse, when she was B. I., would by force of the association awaken\nall her mental associations as B. III., and that, in consequence, B. III.\nspontaneously would be constantly coming into existence of her own\naccord. This afterwards proved to be the case. B. III. always\ninsisted upon having her eyes opened, complaining that she wished to\nsee, and had a \" right to see.\" One day, some time after this, when\nshe was at home, owing to some nervous excitement, she was thrown\ninto the condition of B. III., and then, I not being there to pre\nvent it, she rubbed her eyes until she got them opened, and from\nthat time to this she (B. III.) has had a spontaneous and independent\nexistence.\nThis personality dates her whole independent existence from this\nday, and she always refers to events as being \" before \" or \" after she\ngot her eyes opened.\" That is the central event in her life, just as\n\fXL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 469\nmothers date periods before or after the birth of a child. Now this\npersonality came afterwards to be known as Sally Beauchamp. (The\nname Beauchamp has been adopted in this account for all the person\nalities.) She took the name for fun one day, a name that she got out\nof some book, and by that name she has been known ever since. In\ncharacter she differs very remarkably from B. I. I would say here\nthat B. I. is a very serious-minded person, fond of books and study, of\na religious turn of mind, and possesses a very morbid conscientious\nness. She has a great sense of responsibility in life, and with those\nwho know her trouble is rather sad and depressed in her general\naspect, the latter the result of the general troubles and trials of her\nlife. Sally, on the other hand, is full of fun, does not worry about\nanything ; all life is one great joke to her ; she hates books, loves fun\nand amusement, does not like serious things, hates church,\u2014in fact is\nthoroughly childlike in every way. She is a child of nature. She is not\nas well educated as is Miss Beauchamp, although she reads and writes\nEnglish well ; yet she complains constantly that she cannot express\nherself easily in writing, but she does it quite well all the same. She\neannot read French or any of the foreign languages which Miss Beau\nchamp knows, and she cannot write shorthand ; in short lacks a great\nmany of the educational accomplishments which the other character\npossesses. She insists, although of this I have no absolute proof, that\nshe never sleeps, and that she is always awake while Miss Beauchamp\nis asleep. I believe it to be true. Then Miss B. is a neurasthenic,\nSally is perfectly well. She is never fatigued and never suffers pain.\nDuring the first year Sally and Miss Beauchamp used to come and go\nin succession. At first whenever B. I. became fatigued or upset from\nany cause, Sally was likely to come. The periods during which Sally\nwas in existence might be any time from a few minutes to several\nhours. Later these periods became prolonged to several days. It\nmust not be forgotten that though Miss Beauchamp knows nothing\nof Sally, Sally, when not in the flesh, is conscious of all Miss Beau-\nchamp's thoughts and doings, and the latter could hide nothing from\nher. Curiously enough, Sally took an intense dislike to B. I. She\nactually hated h'jr. She used to say to me, \" Why, I hate her, Dr.\nPrince ! \" and there was no length to which Sally would not go to\ncause her annoyance. She would play every kind of prank on her to\nmake her miserable. She tormented her to a degree almost incredible.\nWhile Sally would never do anything to make any one else unhappy,\n,she was absolutely remorseless in the way she tormented Miss Beau\nchamp by practical jokes and by playing upon her sensibilities. For\nexample, 1 will give a few illustrations. If there is one thing which\nMiss Beauchamp has a perfect horror of, it is snakes and spiders.\nThey throw her into a condition of terror. One day Sally went\n\f470 Dr. Morton Prince. [part\nout into the country and collected some snakes and spiders and\nput them into a little box. She brought them home and did them\nup in a little package, anrl addressed them to Miss Beauchanip, and\nwhen B. I. opened the package they ran out and about the room and\nnearly sent her into fits. In order to get rid of them she had to\nhandle them, which added to her terror. Another joke was to take\nMiss Beauchamp out into the country when she was very tired, and in\nan unfit condition to walk ; that is, Saily would take a car and go out\nsix or seven miles into the country to some retired place, and wake up\nMiss Beauchamp, who would find herself far out in the country with\nno means of getting home, no money in her pocket, and nothing for it\nbut to walk. She had to beg rides when she could from passing\nwaggons, and come back tired, worn out, used up for a week.\nA great friend of Miss Beauchamp, to whom she felt under strong\nobligations, had asked her to knit a baby's blanket. She worked on\nthat blanket for nearly a year ; as fast as she would get it near com\npletion, Sally would unravel it, and then, like Sisyphus, she would have\nto begin the task again, and regularly every time Sally would pull the\nwhole thing to pieces. Finally she came to herself one day and found\nherself standing in the middle of the room tied up in a perfect\nnetwork and snarl of worsted yarn ; it was wound round the pictures\nand then round and round the furniture, the bed, the chairs, herself,\nand she had to cut it to get out of the snarl. Another favourite joke\nof Sally's was to make Miss Beauchamp lie. She had the power when\nshe pleased, of producing aboulia, and also of making B. I. say and do\nthings against her will ; for after a fashion she can get control of her\narms and legs, and of her tongue.\nSally made her tell most frightful fibs. For instance, when asked\nwho lived in a small squalid little house at the side of the road, she\nsaid \" Mrs. J. G.,\" a very prominent lady in society, and very wealthy.\n\" Why, I thought she was rich ! \" \" Oh, yes, but she has lost all her\nmoney now.\" Miss Beauchamp would be mortified at hearing herself tell\nthese astounding bare-faced fibs, which her listener must know were fibs,\nbut she could not help it. Again, for a time at least, Sally put B. I. on\nan allowance of five cents a day. She would find the money waiting\nfor her in the morning on the table with a note' saying that it was her\nallowance for the day and she could not spend more. Sally took away\nher postage stamps, and if Miss Beauchamp wrote a letter it had first\nto be exhibited to Sally, and if Sally approved it, it was posted ; if not,\nit did not go, and that was the end of it. Miss Beauchamp is a person\nwith a great sense of dignity, and dislikes anything that smacks of a\nlack of decorum or of familiarity. Sally had a way of punishing her\nby making her sit on a chair with her feet upon the mantelpiece.\nB. I. could not take her feet down, and was mortified to think she had\n\fXL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 471\nto sit that way. Sally carries on a correspondence with Miss\nBeauchamp, writes letters to her pointing out all the weak points of her\ncharacter, dwelling on all the little slips and foibles of her mind, telling\nher all the reckless acts and secret thoughts, indeed, everything she has\ndone that won't bear criticism. In fact, when she has a chance to\nstick a pin into her, she does it. When Miss Beauchamp wakes in the\nmorning, she will find pinned up on the wall of the room verses con\ntaining all sorts of personal allusions, letters calling her names, telling\nfictitious things that people have said about her ; in short, doing\neverything imaginable to make her life miserable. Nevertheless, at\ntimes when she goes too far, Sally has got frightened, and then she\nwould write me a letter and ask for help, saying that she \" could not\ndo anything with Miss Beauchamp, and I really must help her.\"\nOne of the most interesting problems is, who is Sally 1 My original\ntheory about Sally was that she represented an earlier period of B.I.'s\nlife. From Sally's childlike peculiarities, which gave the impression of\na girl of about thirteen or fourteen, in connection with certain other\nevidences of a more mature mind, I arrived at this conclusion, and\nthought that probably some accident had happened in her life which\nhad split her off from the main consciousness, and that Sally was a\nreversion to that early period ; but this theory I was obliged later to\ngive up. Sally as an individuality goes much further back than this :\nshe goes back to early infancy, and has grown with the growth of Miss\nBeauchamp. The theory which finally, I think, has been demonstrated,\nis that Sally represents the subliminal consciousness.\nAlthough B. I. knows nothing of Sally, Sally not only is conscious\nof Miss Beauchamp's thoughts at the moment they arise, but she is\ncapable, as I have said, of controlling her thoughts and her arms and\nlegs and tongue to a certain extent. Sally can produce positive and\nnegative hallucination in B. I. and frequently does so for a practical\njoke. During the times when Sally is in existence, B. I. is,\u2014as Sally\nputs it,\u2014\" dead,\" and these times represent complete gaps in Miss\nBeauchamp's memory, and she has no knowledge of them whatever.\n\" What becomes of her 1 \" Sally frequently asks. Sally is never \" dead.\"\nHer memory is continuous ; there are no gaps in it. She not only\nknows,\u2014simultaneously, as I said,\u2014all of B. I.'s thoughts and emotions\nand sensations, but more than that ;\u2014 Sally's thoughts are entirely\ndistinct from and independent of B. I.'s thoughts, with which they are\nco-existent, but not identical. B. I.'s thoughts are not Sally's thoughts.\nSally's thoughts co-exist alongside of and simultaneously with B. I.'s ;\nbut Sally's mental life is made up of entirely different and separate\nthoughts and feelings from B. I.'s, so that Saily will have a train of\nthought at the same time with B. I., of an entirely different nature.\nAll this is also true of the relation of Sally's mind to that of the third\n\f472 Dr. Morton Prince. [part\npersonality\u2014B. IV.\u2014who came later, excepting that Sally does not\nknow B. IV.'s thoughts. While either Miss B. I. or IV. is thinking\nand feeling one thing,\u2014is depressed and self-reproachful, for example,\u2014\nSally is feeling gay and indifferent and enjoying Miss B.'s discomfiture\nand perhaps planning some amusement distasteful to her.\nSpeak to either B. I. or B. IV. and Sally hears you. Say something\nthat Sally alone understands, and you see her smile. She is as much\nalive as the other consciousness. The only difference is this, that her\nconsciousness for the time being is not in connection with the body.\nThen Sally remembers things in the past that B. I. knows nothing\nabout at all, things that she apparently never was conscious of, or\nwhich she has completely forgotten. The most remarkable part of\nSally's personality, I think, is that she has been able to write out for\nme her autobiography, beginning with the time when she was in her\ncradle, which she remembers. She actually describes her own thoughts\nand feelings as distinct from B. I.'s all through her childhood, up to\nand including the present time ; although, as she says, she never got an\nindependent existence until she \"got her eyes open.\" She remembers\nher cradle, draws a picture of the bars in its sides, and remembers what\nshe, as distinct from Miss Beauchamp, thought at the time when she\nwas learning to walk. Then B. I. was frightened and wanted to go\nback, but Sally was not at all frightened and wanted to go ahead. She\ndescribes B. I. as having had a butterfly mind as contrasted with her\nown. She, as a small child, disliked the things that B. I. liked and\nvice versa. She describes her school life, her own feelings when B. I\ndid things, and the different sensations of the two selves when, for\nexample, B. I. was punished and felt badly, and she herself was\nentirely indifferent and without remorse. Thus I have been able to\nget an actual autobiography of a subliminal consciousness, in which are\ndescribed the contemporaneous and contrasted mental lives of two\nconsciousnesses, the subliminal and the dominant, from early infancy to\nadult life. In this Sally has described for me various scenes and\nincidents which occurred and which she saw during her early life, but\nof which Miss Beauchamp is entirely ignorant. These usually represent\nscenes which occurred while B. I. was absorbed in thought, but which\nSally as a subliminal noticed. Taking all this into consideration,\u2014\ntaking the present relations of Sally's thoughts to Miss Beauchamp's\nthought, and many other facts, like automatic writing, which Sally\nperforms with ease, and uses for purposes of correspondence,\u2014I think\nwe are safe in saying that Sally is the subliminal consciousness, which\nhas become highly developed and organised and obtained finally an\nindependent existence, and led an individual life of its own.\nAfter Sally's escape from her mental Bastille, the two went on\nleading their independent lives, coming and going for a year or two,\n\fXL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 473\nuntil one day, June 7th, 1899, an event occurred which had an influence\nupon the whole history of this case. To understand it, it is necessary\nto go back six years, to the year 1893. It appeared that in 1893 Miss\nBeauchamp was in a hospital in a neighbouring city, call it Provi\ndence. She had been taken with the fancy that she would like to be a\nnurse (it was the passion of her life), and in a fit of idealism she\nentered the hospital. One night she was sitting in her room with a\nfriend, a Miss L., when, upon looking up, she was stertled to see a face in\nthe window. It was the face of an old friend of hers, a Mr. \"Jones,\" as\nwe have agreed to call him, whom she had known ever since she was a\nsmall girl, and who had been a sort of preceptor to her. At first she\nthought it was a hallucination, but she presently saw that it was a real\nperson. She then hastily got her friend out of the room, and she\nwent downstairs and out of the side door, where this person met her.\nIt appeared that this person was in Providence on his way to New\nYork, had wandered to the hospital, and seeing the ladder had climbed\nit for a joke, and looked into the window. Outside the hospital door an\nexciting conversation occurred. It was to her of an intensely disturbing\nnature, and gave her a tremendous shock. Perhaps I should say here,\u2014\nas I have told so much of the story,\u2014that it was the kind of thing that\nupon the ordinary person would not have had much influence, but with\nher sensitive and idealistic nature she exaggerated it and gave it an\nintensity that an ordinary person would not have given to it. At any\nrate, it did give her a violent shock. The surroundings, too, were\ndramatic. It was night, and pitch dark, but a storm was coming up,\nand great peals of thunder and flashes of lightning heightened the\nemotional effect. It was only by these flashes that she saw her\ncompanion. From that time she was changed. She went out and\nwalked the fields at night by the hour ; she became nervous, excitable\nand neurasthenic, all her peculiarities became very much exaggerated\nand her character changed ; she became unstable, developed aboulia,\nand, in other words, changed into B. I. So that B. I.,\u2014or, more\ncorrectly, Miss Beauchamp modified into B. I.\u2014dates from the\ntime of that scene outside the hospital that night. Sally, too, who\nknows the inmost soul of Miss Beauchamp, says she changed after\nthat night.\nSo it follows that the Miss Beauchamp who has been the object of\nthis study, has been educated in college, and been the solicitude of\nmany friends, is not properly speaking the original Miss B., but a\nmodified personality rightfully designated as B. I.\nOn the afternoon of June 7th, 1899, six years later, Miss\nBeauchamp was in my office. She was not in any way noticeably\ndifferent from her usual condition. After leaving the office she went\nto the public library, as was her custom. In the library she met\n\f474 Dr. Morion Prinee. [past\na messenger, who quite unexpectedly brought her a letter, and this\nletter was from the person whom we have agreed to call Jones. The\nletter was couched in almost the same language as was his conversation\nat the time of the hospital incident in 1 893. It threw her into a very\nhighly excited state, and she actually saw a vision ;\u2014the scene outside\nthe hospital with herself and Jones as the actors, and actually saw\nherself and him, and saw the flashes of lightning and heard the\nthunder, and through it all his voice. Under the influence of this\nexcitement she went to the reading room, and there had an illusion.\nIn the evening newspaper she saw my name printed in large letters in\nthe headlines, in place of that which was really printed, the name of a\nrelative of mine who had died that morning. Still further upset by\nthis, she made her way home. It was not until many months after this\nthat I learned of this scene, or of the hospital episode in 1893, so that\nit was long before I found the key to the sequel. (As will appear, if I\nhad known of it all, I should have been saved many hours and much\nlabour in the attempt to understand the later psychical developments.)\nAll I knew then was this. After returning from the library, Miss\nBeauchamp was in such a nervous state that I was soon sent for. On\narrival I found her in a very nervous, highly excited condition. She\nwas unable to sit still ; her limbs were in more or less constant motion.\nHer condition was one that I had frequently seen after she had been\nexposed to emotional influences. Presently she changed completely.\nShe became quiet, perfectly natural, talked affably, was very sociable,\nand, in fact, seemed to be in a condition in which I had never seen her\nbefore,\u2014more natural in many ways than I had ever seen her, quiet\nand calm, and apparently in a perfectly healthy state of body and\nmind ; but, to my surprise, I found that she did not know me. She\nsaid I was not Dr. Prince, and when I insisted that I was, she laughed\nand took it just as if I was talking nonsense to her,\u2014if I insisted that\nI was, well, I could have it so, but she knew I wasn't. She said that\nI was perfectly reckless in coming, that I ought not to have come, and\nthen I discovered that she was under the impression, in fact insisted,\nthat I had come in through the window. As we were in the fourth\nstory, it was plain that she was also under an illusion as to the place\nwhere we were. The contrast of these illusions with her normality\nin other respects was striking. The scene lasted some little time.\nFinally I showed her my name in my watch. She underwent a slight\nmental shock. A change came over her. She passed through a brief\nperiod of confusion and then became herself again, but without any recol\nlection of what had occurred. The essential points I would emphasise\nare that,\u2014besides appearing perfectly normal,\u2014she insisted that I\nwas Jones, imagined we were somewhere else, that I had come in\nthrough the window, that I ran great risks in coming because of the\n\fXL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 475\npublicity, that I ought not to have done it, and that it was a foolish\ntiring to have done. Being ignorant of the preceding events just narrated,\nit was not clear at first whether this was simply Miss B. under an\nillusion, or whether it was a new personality similarly affected.\nTo cut a long story short (for it took a long time to unravel the\nmystery), it turned out to be a new personality, who had at this moment\nwaked up, and had gone back six years in her life, and now imagined\nit was the same night and she was in the same room in the hospital\nwhere she had seen that face in the window in 1893. The impetus to\nher awakening had evidently been given by the shock of the letter and\nthe vision in the library a few hours before ; awakening she went\non with her life where she had left off, with the last vestige of memory,\nwhich was seeing Jones at the window. Under the influence of this\nsuggestion (she and B. I. are very suggestible) she mistook me for\nJones, and, having seen him, as she thought, a moment before (really\nsix years previously) at the window, inferred I had entered by that\nmeans. The impropriety and unwisdom of it all was a natural thought.\nThis new personality became known in these studies as B. IV.\nThe next time I saw B. IV. she was free from all illusion, but I\nwas struck by her formal and distant attitude. It soon transpired that\nshe did not know me or the consulting room, where B. I. had been\ntime and again. In fact she knew absolutely nothing of the events of\nthe past six years, knew nothing of B. I.'s life in college, knew nothing\nof the friends whom B. I. had made during these years, knew nothing of\nme, knew nothing of any of these events whatsoever, nor later, after she\nwas domiciled as one of the Beauchamp family, did she know anything\nabout the present times when B. I. or Sally was present. From this it\nfollows that she knew, and continued to know, nothing of either B. I.\nor Sally, or that there ever were such personalities.\nIt took her a long time to accommodate herself to the new order of\nthings and to take up the thread of events. Like Rip Van Winkle,\nshe did not know that the world had moved since she went to sleep.\nSally, who was invaluable as an informer, used to report that she\nseemed to live in the past and used to speak to people as if it was still\n1893. So the family now was increased by one, and there were three\nwho kept changing with one another.\nB. IV. is a very different character from either Sally or Miss\nBeauchamp. A study of the different habits of thoughts, tastes and\nemotions of these three people has thrown, I believe, much light upon\nthe psychology of character, but in this report I must limit myself to a\nmere outline of events. There were, of course, gaps in the memory of\nB. IV. (as with B. I.) corresponding to the time of the existence of the\nother two personalities. But this B. IV. was never willing to admit.\nUnlike the others, she is irritable and quick-tempered, and resented as\n\f476 Dr. Morton Prince. [pakt\nan impertinence\u2014especially as she regarded most of us as strangers\u2014\nany inquiry into her private thoughts and affairs, and above all any\ninterference with her habits of life and private conduct. Though\nanxious to know, she was not willing to ask about what had occurred\nin the gaps when the others were in the flesh, and so was in the habit\nof inferring and guessing, at which she was very skilful. She was, as\nstated, even unwilling for a long time to admit that there were gaps,\nbut it was easy to convict her here by a few questions. After fibbing\nand inferring and guessing, she would break down and confess she did\nnot know, which was the fact.\nNow, Sally, although her mental life is also continuous during that\nof B. IV. (as with B. I.) an *. although she knows everything B. IV.\ndoes at the time she does it, hears what she says, reads what she writes,\nand sees what she does, nevertheless Sally does not know B. IV.'s\nthoughts. Herein is a very interesting psychological distinction\nbetween Sally's relation to B. I. and to B. IV. She knows B. I.'s\ninmost soul, she can only 'nfer B. IV.'s thoughts from what she says\nand does. But Sally studied her closely and soon discovered for herself\nthat B. IV. knew nothing of the past six years, but was always\nsecretly trying to obtain infer mation, and guessing. Sally, in her\nastonishment, used to say \" Why, she doesn't know anything, she is\nalways fishing and guessing.\" For this reason, Sally, until she learned\nto know B. IV. better, had a great contempt for her, and dubbed her\nthe \" Idiot,\" and whenever after this she spoke of her, it was as the\n\"Idiot.\" From this time on, Sally transferred her hatred from B. I. to\nthe \" Idiot.\" She came to regard B. I. as rather a poor sort of creature\nand hardly worthy of her consideration anyway, and let her alone ;\nbut B. IV. became the object of her attacks. But B. IV. is more\nthan a match for Sally, who is really afraid of her. They quarrel like\ncats and dogs. One of the most curious and puzzling things was the\ncause of Sally's hatred of B. I. It was unmitigated jealousy. She\nwas jealous of the attentions B. I. received, jealous of the fact that\npeople liked B. I. and wanted to keep her in existence instead of\nherself, and therefore\u2014 -difficult as it is to conceive of a person\njealous of herself\u2014Saily was immensely jealous of herself.\nI have said that B. IV.'s memory ceases at Providence with\nseeing the face in- the window. She can tell you nothing after that,\nand knows nothing of the scene outside the door. Both B. I. and\nSally recall and describe similarly that scene, but the last thing B. IV.\nremembers is the face at the window a few minutes before.1 As one\nmethod of corroboration of these events, I produced in B. IV. a crystal\n1 The lack of this knowledge was afterwards thi' cause of much trouble to B. IV.,\nwhich was strong evidence of her ignorance.\n\fXL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 477\nvision.1 I gave her a glass globe to look at, and told her to think of\nProvidence. As she looked into the glass she was horrified to see there\nthe scene that took place outside the hospital door. She declared with\nmuch excitement that it was not true, that it never had occurred, and\nthis she repeated again and again, and remonstrated against my\nbelieving it. Like B. I. in the Library, she saw herself by flashes of\nlightning standing by the door with Jones. She saw his excited manner,\nand heard his voice between the peals of thunder. She saw it all as a\nvision, just as it occurred. She was startled by what she saw and\nexperienced over again all the emotion of the original scene.\nI am obliged to omit all reference to the extraordinary misadventures\nand misunderstandings of these three personalities brought about in part\nby the ignorance of B. I. and B. IV. of each other, and the consequent\nconflict of their plans and doings, in part by the difference of the\ncharacters of all three, and in part by the mischievousness of Sally,\nwho concocted a little Midsummer Night's Dream of her own, and as\nPuck (with a little dash of Iago) played her pranks upon both. Some\nof these adventures were laughable and some were tragic, as when in\ndespair Miss B. I. tried to commit suicide by going to bed with the\nilluminating gas turned on, and Sally came, jumped out of bed,\nopened the window, turned off the gas, and saved Miss Beauchamp's\nlife.\nFor some time after B. IV.'s appearance I adopted the theory that\nshe was the real and original Miss Beauchamp, who had gone to sleep\nin 1893 and had now become awakened. It followed from this that\nMiss Beauchamp No. 1, whom we had all learned to know and respect,\nwho had been educated and made many friends, was nothing but a\nsomnambulistic person, and had really no right to existence. The\nsituation was a tragic one : a cure meant the annihilation of Miss\nBeauchamp, her psychical murder and disappearance as a person, as\nmuch as if she were condemned to physical death. Under this theory\nI sought to keep B. IV. and annihilate B. I.\nWhen I came to know B. IV. better, however, it became evident\nthat this theory was incorrect. However normal she appeared to be\nand however much more like the original 1893 Miss Beauchamp than\nB. I. she was in some ways, in other respects she was less like her.\nMorally and intellectually she lacks many qualities. For instance,\nunlike the original, she is quick-tempered (Sally calls it \" a nasty\ntemper \"), is devoid of idealism, is unimpressionable ; pictures and\nbooks do not affect her, she hates church and religion, and not onlv\nhas no love of music, but has lost the power of reading it and playing\n1 A study of Visions based on this case may be found in Brain, 1898. See also\nProceeding S.P.R., Vol. XIV., pp. 366 it seq.\n\f478 Dr. Morton Prince. [part\n,\nthe violin. So the theory of the re-awakening of the original self was\nnot substantiated.\nThis is an important point from the bearing it has on some\nhysterical phenomena, and I regret I cannot go into it further here.\nWhen a hysteric is thrown into another state\u2014is awakened, as I with\nSollier would prefer to put it,\u2014and immediately goes back to a day on\nwhich an accident occurred and takes up the thread of her mental life\nat that moment, with amnesia for all succeeding events,\u2014does it\nnecessarily follow that the new state is more normal than the others,\nand is the original self 1 I think not.\nNow the most interesting and most important question is, what is\nthe relationship between all the personalities ? What relation do they\nbear to the normal personality ;\u2014and for that matter, which is the\nnormal Miss Beauchamp ; or is any one of them the real and normal\nindividual 1 Allow me a few moments to sketch,\u2014and it must be\nliterally to sketch only\u2014a few of the characteristics of B. I. and\nB. IV. Sally has been sufficiently emphasised. The continuity of\nher memory, her origin in and slow development from early infancy,\nher persistence as a subterranean consciousness, while the other\npersonalities are in evidence, the co-existence of her consciousness\nsimultaneously with those of B. I. and B. IV., her power to influence\nthe consciousness of these others, and to act upon their body, the\nindependence of her thought, her power to express her thoughts\nindependently in writing during the existence of the other two\npersons ;\u2014all this stamps her as a highly developed subliminal\nconsciousness, who, confined in the chrysalis until 1897, broke out\nthen and flew away as an independent life.\nBut B. I. and B. IV., who are they ?\nOne thing must be insisted upon ;\u2014namely, however normal each\nmay appear superficially, neither is quite normal. In each are missing\nsome of the attributes of the original Miss Beauchamp, but in\nB. I. the departure from the normal is the least. Her neurasthenic\ncondition, her aboulia, her extreme suggestibility, by which negative\nhallucination can be produced at will, her exaggerated sensitiveness to\nemotional influences, like music and religion, which produce certain\npsychical phenomena, the dominion which ideas acquire in her mind,\nthe exaggeration of certain traits always possessed by her, her tendency\nto disintegration, by which she at times loses temporarily certain\nacquirements, like the French language : these and other peculiarities\nare evidence that a certain amount of disintegration took place in 1 893\nby which the original personality became fractured and modified.\nNevertheless, it would be an exaggeration to affirm that she is a wholly\nnew and distinct personality, or that she is a vigilambulist. It is more\ncorrect to say that certain components of her personality have become\n\fxl.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 479\ndisintegrated from the rest, certain local areas of her brain, as I have\nelsewhere put it,1 have gone to sleep. The original self has become\nmodified into B. I.\nB. IV., notwithstanding her greater stability, is a still greater de\nparture from the original self. Her character is totally different ; her\ngeneral attitude towards her environment has changed, for there is\nmissing the taste for, that is, the normal reactions to music, literature\nand religion. She has also lost her knowledge of music. She has no\nemotionability, excepting bad temper ; in short, she has retained some\ncharacteristics, and lost others of the original self.\nNow any theory we adopt must explain all this, as well as the\nparticular forms of amnesia and continuities of memory. The explana\ntion which I believe to be the correct one is this : Neither B. I. nor\nB. IV. is strictly the original self, nor are they somnambulistic\npersonalities, but modifications of the original self. The original Miss\nB. became disintegrated and as a complete psychical composition de\nparted this life in 1893. B. I. and B. IV. are each different disinte\ngrated parts of the complete Miss Beauchamp. In the disintegration\nof the primary consciousness a certain portion split itself off and\nbecame dormant. The remainder persisted as a modified personality\u2014\nB. I. Sufficient remained to retain the memories of the past, which\nfrom this time became organised with all future experiences and made\na continuous memory and personality.\nThe split-off dormant portion was awakened six years later as a\nresult of an intense excitation of its constituent memories by the\nshock in the Library, and in the awakening wrenched away from B. I.\na portion of her mental associations, which thus became common to\nboth. As in 1893, a certain number of groups of psychical associations,\nthat now belonged to B. I., remained split off and dormant. Those that\nremained awake became organised into another personality as B. IV.\nIt is as two circles which inter\nsect one another. A part of each\ncircle remains outside the other,\nwhile a part of the field is common\nto both.\nThus the dominant part of\nB. IV.'s consciousness, being awake\nup to 1893, remembers her whole\nlife until that date ; but being\nasleep from 1893 to 1899, she has\nno knowledge of the events of this\n1 ?ee \" A Contribution to the Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis, etc.,\" in the\nProceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, Vol. XIV., p. 95.\n\f480 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nperiod. Waking up again suddenly in 1899, she goes back to the day\nwhen she went to sleep, as would any person who had slept an\nunusual number of days and nights. Again, B. I. and B. IV. have\nno knowledge of B. III., because B. III. is a subliminal. B. I. .and\nB. IV. have no knowledge of each other, because the essential\nassociations of one are asleep when those of the other are in activity.\nAnother analogy would be that of a beam of white light passed\nthrough a prism and disintegrated into its component rays.\nSo we may imagine that the catastrophe of 1893 acted like a prism\nand split off certain rays of consciousness and left a mutilated\npersonality B.

This subliminal consciousness\nduring all the early life has no independent existence, but merely the\nordinary relations, as in all of us. Finally, in 1893, a psychical shock\nis sustained, the result of which is that her mind is put through a\nprism and a certain number of rays are separated from the rest and\nare developed into an independent personality as B. I. B. I. exists for\nsix years. Then, as the result of another psychical shock, a certain\nnuml)er of these rays of B. I. are disintegrated, rejoin those left hehind\nin 1893, and form B. IV. After this, owing to various slighter causes,\nthese middle rays oscillated backwards and forwards, first joining the\nrays of B. IV. and then of B. I. and together making these alternating\npersonalities.\nIn 1897, B. III., the subliminal consciousness, became developed\nand acquired an independent existence, and became known as Sally ;\nso that Sally represents the subliminal consciousness, and B. I. and\nB. IV. simply certain disintegrated elements in the primary supernatant\nconsciousness. The result is that neither B. I. nor B. IV. is the whole\noriginal Miss Beauchamp, but, \u2014if my studies have led me to the\nright interpretation,\u2014the original self is a combination of the two.\nIf this be true, it should be possible to combine them and obtain the\noriginal self.\n\fXL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 481\nAll this might be expressed in more technical and more purely\npsychological language, but the principles would not be made clearer\nthereby, nor would the knowledge of the process be in any way added\nto. Disintegration means suppression of function of centres and groups\nof centres, and severance of associations between centres. Personality\nprobably means particular composite groupings of centres by associa\ntion processes. A difference in personality probably means a difference\nin the composition and grouping.\nAs to the physiological process, it must be that there exists\nnormally some kind of physiological mechanism which allows dis\nintegration to occur, and that normally, within certain limits, such\ndisintegration is constantly occurring as a part of the mechanism of\nnormal cerebration. In hysteria this physiological mechanism is\ncarried to an extreme and pathological degree.\nWhatever the anatomical change may be, I am at one with Sollier\nin believing it to be the same as normal sleep, only localised.1\nTo go back for a moment. There remains B. II. ; who is B. II. 1\nNow it is possible to hypnotise B. I. and also B. IV., so that both\nof these hypnotic states are quasi, but not perfect, personalities.\nAt first I thought these hypnotic states were separate and distinct,\nand the one was called B. II. and the other B. VI. ; but afterwards it\ntranspired that B. I. and B. IV. hypnotised became the same person,\nor B. II. B. II., then, is a part of B. I. and also of B. IV. Some\nelements common to them both,\u2014the hypnotic self of both,\u2014in her will\nare combined. If you ask who B. II. is, she says : \" I am myself,\"\nor \" I am B. I.,\" or \" I am B. IV.\" or \" Both,\" or \" I do not know\u2014\nI am both.\" B. II. knows the thoughts of B. I. and equally knows\nthe thoughts of B. IV., but B. I. and B. IV. know nothing of B. II.\nNow, if the original complete Miss Beauchamp is a total combina\ntion of the whole of B. I. and of B. IV., then if we could put I. and II.\ntogether, we ought to get Miss Beauchamp. This I was able to do by\nsuggestion given to the hypnotic self, B. II., and to obtain the original\nself for a number of hours at a time. I suggested to B. II. that when\nawake as B. I. she would know all about B. IV., and as B. IV. would\nknow all about B. I. and feel and think as B. I. did. I then waked\nher up successively as B. I. and as B. IV. In each case she knew all\nabout the times to which I had special reference when I gave the\nsuggestions. As B. I. she told me what she had been doing as B. IV.,\nand as B. IV. what she had been doing as B. I As B. I. she said she\nfelt like herself in the early days before 1893, as she had not felt\nfor years, and also knew what she had done as B. IV., which I had\n1 See \"A Contribution to the Study of Hysteria, etc.,\" in the Proceedings of the\nSociety for Psychical Resetirch, Vol. XIV., pp. 05-6.\n2 L\n\f482 Dr. Morton Prince. [part\nsuggested she would remember. So that in her sensations and acquire\nments and memory, she, when thus put together, to all appearances was\nthe original Jfiss Beauchamp.\nThis new personality is plainly a composite of B. I. and B. IV. ;\nnot only in memory, but in character, tastes, and general make-up.\nSally calls her \"that new thing,\" and has very little, if any, control\nover her. She herself does not know which she is,\u2014I. or IV.,\u2014but\nsays she is both. When she is present, Sally tends to sink out of sight\nand go back\u2014as Sally puts it\u2014 \" to where I came from.\"\nThis final synthesis,\u2014the construction of what appears to be the\noriginal self,\u2014seems to me akin to a proof of the correctness of the\ndiagnosis.\nI should like to tell something of the way in which the subliminal\nself has contributed to the elucidation of some of these problems, by\nlistening, so to speak, to the thoughts and studying the characters of\nthese personalities, and reporting her observations ; also of the social\nrelations of the members of the \" family \" amongst themselves, and the\nextensive controversies carried on by the, subliminal self by means of\nautomatic writing ; also of the subliminal communicating by speech\nwhen B. I. or B. IV. are in existence, and of the positive and negative\nhallucinations created by this self. But these and many other inte\nresting phenomena must be left to a more extended report.\nThere is something unique in studying the laws of the mind\nthrough the intelligent observations of a subliminal self. This is but a\nbrief sketch, and includes only a few of the salient features of this\nstudy.\nBy way of Summary, I would offer for discussion the following con\nclusions which seem to be justified by this case :\u2014-\n(a) The subliminal self may become developed into a true inde\npendent personality, which may be awake contemporaneously with the\nprimary consciousness, or may be alone awake, the other personalities\nbeing asleep.\n(b) Other so-called and apparent personalities may be nothing more\nthan the primary self, mutilated by disintegration.\n(c) The absence of knowledge and hence amnesia on the part of\nthe primary self of the subliminal is dependent on the normal psycho\nphysiological arrangements.\n(d) The amnesia of one mutilated self for another mutilated self\nis due to disintegration and to a severance and rearrangement of\npsycho-physiological associations.\n\fxl.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 483\n(e) Theoretically any number of personalities are possible,\naccording to the number and direction of the lines of cleavage.\nEach personality would depend on different combinations of different\ndisintegrated pieces of the normal self.\n(\/) Personalities may develop accidentally, as the result of\naccidental fracture, without design, and not be the result of education.\n(g) The subliminal consciousness is not necessarily the equivalent\nof the hypnotic self.\n(h) Personalities may represent any different psychical compounds.\nOne may be that peculiar group of psychical elements which is called\nthe subliminal self, and another may be a disintegrated compound of\nthe ordinary supernatant self.\n(i) Two or more personalities may have successive existences in\ntime, or when one is the subliminal self they may be co-existent.\n(J) Personalities, including the subliminal self, may be hypnotised,\nand thus the personalities may become still further disintegrated.\n2 l 2\n\f484 Edmund Gurney Library.\nEDMUND GURNEY LIBRARY.\nSUPPLEMENTARY CATALOGUE, 1900.\nAdditions since the list in \"Proceedings,\" Vol. XIV.\nBarth (George), Mesmerism not Miracle.
